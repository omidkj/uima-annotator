Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath; hematuria; urinary
frequency and urgency; back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year old female in
her usual state of health which includes having to ambulate
with assistance who saw her podiatrist and dentist on [**5-25**]
without any difficulty.  That evening she had hematuria
noticed by her daughter who obtained a clean catch at home
and took urinalysis and culture to her primary care
physician.  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 3 AM on the day of admission she developed her
first symptoms which included rigors, a fever of 100.7,
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, left flank pain as well as
dizziness and cough, dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity
edema which was slightly worse than her baseline.  Her
daughter took her to [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]/[**Hospital **] Hospital where she was
afebrile with a heartrate of 127, blood pressure 130/61 and
respiratory rate of 36 sating 97% on room air.  At the
outside hospital her lungs were described as clear.  She was
developing a metabolic acidosis and mild hypoxia and
underwent a V/Q scan which was low probability.  She received
Levofloxacin and intravenous fluids as well as Lasix.  Over
the course of her Emergency Room stay there, she became
confused and febrile.  She was given Ativan for anxiety and
her lungs gradually developed a crackle and wheeze.  Anemia,
elevated troponin, elevated creatinine and BUN were noted on
her laboratory data.  The team recommended transfer to [**Hospital6 1760**].  She was intubated for
transfer for Life Flight as she was apparently have worsening
respiratory distress.  On arrival her temperature was 102.6,
blood pressure was 105/55, then dropping to 88 systolic for
which she received 3 liters of intravenous fluid.  The
patient was fighting FIMV mode of ventilation and she was
given Ativan, Morphine and Vecuronium times one and switched
to assist control.  PH improved from 7.17 to 7.34 with a pCO2
improving from 58 to 38.  Endotracheal tube was repositioned
secondary to right main stem location.  Ceftriaxone was given
secondary to the concern about the p.o. Levofloxacin
absorption given at the outside hospital.  Troponin was
noticed to be 11.  Her CKs were negative.  She was treated
with Aspirin 5 mg intravenously and Lopressor in the
Emergency Room.  She was noted to be heme positive with a
decreased hematocrit and heparin was held.  She had a right
internal jugular central line placed in the Emergency Room
and she was transferred to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Diabetes Type 2 with chronic renal
failure with proteinuria and history of foot ulcer; 2.
Bilateral mastectomy for comfort, no history of cancer; 3.
Cerebrovascular accident with a residual left hemiparesis in
[**2099**], also some memory impairment; 4.  Hypercholesterolemia;
5.  Hysterectomy and appendectomy.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Not available.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not drink or smoke.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin? as well as to Sulfa, Erythromycin and
Ciprofloxacin which reportedly cause gastrointestinal upset,
one of these but it is not known which one caused a rash
according to the daughter.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Avandia 4 q.d.; Amaryl 4 q.d.; Lasix 40
q.d.; Avalide 6.25/25 q.d.; Celebrex 200 prn; Plavix 75;
Lipitor 20; Aspirin 81; Gemfibrozil 600 b.i.d.

BASELINE LABORATORY DATA:  Baseline laboratory data obtained
from her primary care physician on [**5-29**], showed a BUN of 45
and creatinine of 1.3 at baseline, microalbumin to creatinine
ratio of 1,667 with normal being less than 30, cholesterol of
182, HDL 46, LDL 117, triglyceride 124, hematocrit 35.4, no
history of gastrointestinal bleed and a panculture in primary
care physician's office growing Proteus mirabilis sensitive
to Bactrim, Ampicillin, Gentamicin, Cefuroxime, Cephalothin
and Ceftriaxone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on arrival
revealed temperature up to 103.8, pulse in the 60s to 110s,
blood pressure 120 systolic climbing to 70s after 5 mg of
Lopressor, respiratory rate 16 on assist control.  In general
she is intubated to date, is paralyzed, no reaction to
sternal rub after Vecuronium.  Pupils were slightly reactive
and equal.  She had no coronal reflex, no Doll's eye, no
evident jugulovenous distension, however, she does have a
thick neck.  Endotracheal tube was in place.  She was regular
with a mild tachycardia, distant heartsounds but S1 and S2
appreciated.  She had bilateral mastectomy scars.  Lung
examination showed rhonchi and wheezes bilaterally.  She had
crackles, left greater than right.  Abdomen had faint bowel
sounds, soft, obese without masses.  There was a hysterectomy
scar.  Extremities had mild pitting edema but not excessively
warm or cold.  She had decreased pulses distally.  There were
no foot ulcers.  Nasogastric aspirate showed clear mucous
with some blood streaks that cleared.  There was no rash.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission, white blood
count 9.3, it was 3 at the outside hospital, hematocrit 23.1,
27 at the outside hospital, platelets 192.  Differential, 59
neutrophils, 28 bands, 5 monos, 3 atypicals, 6 metas.  Chem-7
notable for a potassium of 3.5, creatinine of 2.5, BUN 70,
bicarbonate of 21, INR 1.3, normal liver function tests,
moderate leukocyte esterase on urinalysis with greater than
50 white blood cells and many bacteria.  Troponin was 11
which climbs to 28.5, Phena .3% despite Lasix and arterial
blood gases 7.17, 58, 246, improving to 734, 38 and 350,
after ventilator changes.  Chest x-ray showed endotracheal
tube in right main stem which was pulled back to a good
position as well as carotid vasculature due to low lung
volumes but no evidence of pneumonia.  Electrocardiogram
showed sinus rhythm at 80 with normal axis, a Q in 3 and
question of slight ST depression laterally and some T wave
flattening.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Infectious disease - The patient was
continued on her Ceftriaxone.  Starting the evening of
admission she required Dopamine to support her blood pressure
through her sepsis, as well as vigorous intravenous fluids.
After we received the results of her urine culture at her
primary care physician's office her antibiotics were briefly
changed to Cefuroxime, however, that evening she became
septic again with a low blood pressure and recurrent fever on
the evening of [**5-29**].  On the morning of [**5-30**], she was
back on pressors and her antibiotics were broadened to
Ceftazidime and Vancomycin.  Workup for her current fever
included chest x-ray which reportedly showed a layering
effusion, however, there was no effusion by ultrasound and
the appearance was attributed to soft tissues.  A
computerized tomography scan of her chest and abdomen was
performed next which showed left obstruction of the renal
pelvis with stones.  The Urology consult was obtained and she
was stented by Urology on the morning of [**6-2**] with release
of pus under pressure.  Afterwards her antibiotics were
changed back to Ceftriaxone and she improved thereafter.  She
did have one brief period of DIC which resolved around the
time of [**5-30**].  She also had blood cultures from her
arterial line growing Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
epidermidis and Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in one
bottle and was treated initially with Vancomycin and then
Laniazid when her Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus results
returned.  She also had one bottle growing
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis from her
triple lumen catheter which was recited first in her groin
and then to the subclavian site.  She was given a ten day
course of Laniazid which was discontinued on [**6-11**].  Her
Ceftriaxone for Proteus was discontinued on [**6-10**].

2.  Cardiovascular - She was given Aspirin, Plavix and
Lipitor.  Her troponin climbed to 28.5.  Cardiology was
curb-sided which said this could be attributed to sepsis
only.  Heparin was deferred because of her gastrointestinal
bleed.  She underwent an echocardiogram which showed a 60 to
65% ejection fraction and lipoma
