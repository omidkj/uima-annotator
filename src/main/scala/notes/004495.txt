Admission Date:  [**2142-2-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-3-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2070-4-25**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Vascular Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Gangrene right first toe.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71-year-old Asian
male with a past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease, diabetes mellitus and complete heart block
who was noted to have a right great toe ulcer several weeks
ago after a corn was trimmed.  The patient was seen by
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
surgical evaluation.  Apparently a need for the bypass graft
was discussed but patient was reluctant and requested a
second opinion.  He was then sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] who felt
that a bypass was also needed as well and he was then
admitted for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2136**],
complete heart block leading to cardiac arrest, shock and
intubation in [**2140-2-2**].  Catheterization at that time
revealed non reconstructible disease.  Diabetes mellitus
since age 30, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peptic ulcer
disease with a history of upper GI bleed while on IV Heparin
and pneumonia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
bypass grafting times five in [**2136**], cataract extraction by
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in [**2139**].

MEDICATIONS:  On admission were significant for Aspirin 325
mg q a.m., Allopurinol 100 mg q a.m., Colchicine 0.6 mg q 48
hours, Lasix 40 mg q a.m., Lasix 40 mg q p.m., Digoxin 0.125
mg q d, Accupril 20 mg po q d, Aldactone 25 mg po bid,
Prilosec 20 mg po bid, Lipitor 10 mg po q h.s., Multivitamin
one po q a.m., Insulin sliding scale 22 units NPH q a.m.,
Humalog sliding scale.

ALLERGIES:  Pramiracetam which leads to elevated LFT levels.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] where he was started on Levofloxacin
and Flagyl.  He was planned for an angiogram and arm vein
mapping and later a right first toe amputation.  He underwent
a right first toe amputation on [**2142-2-15**].  Details of this
procedure are detailed in a separate operative note.  He was
then taken down to the angiography suite later that day for
an arteriogram which revealed mild bilateral renal artery
stenoses.  No significant aortoiliac disease.  Mild to
moderate right superficial femoral artery disease and
moderate to severe popliteal artery disease.  An occluded
right anterior tibial artery at the origin.  Right posterior
tibial artery with multiple stenoses, but constituting major
run-off to the foot.  Reconstruction to dorsalis pedis artery
at the foot and preserved plantar arches.  Based on these
findings, the patient was then sent for arm vein mapping as
he did have reconstructible peripheral vascular disease.  It
was decided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] that the left greater saphenous
vein would be used.  It should be noted that the right
greater saphenous vein was used for his coronary artery
bypass graft.  The patient did have decent sized veins in the
right basilic vein, however, the rest of his arm veins were
somewhat inadequate and a longer vein would be needed for the
bypass.  Prior to the bypass procedure, cardiology
consultation was sought.  They felt that he was at a
significant risk secondary to his co-morbidities.  They
recommended not continuing Lopressor as the patient had
history of severe bradycardia going into cardiac arrest in
the past.  He was then scheduled for bypass grafting for the
following week.

The patient was doing quite well before his bypass when it
was noted that the patient was found to be unresponsive by
the nurses.  A code was called and ACLS was initiated.  When
the patient was hooked up to the monitor it was noted that he
had severe bradycardia with heart rates in the 30's to 40's.
Blood pressure was in the 80's to 90's.  He was then
subsequently given Atropine with good response.  Based on
these, it was felt he would subsequently need a permanent
pacemaker as well as an AICD placed.  Dictation to be
continued at supper time.
