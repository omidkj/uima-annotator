toxicology with plans for Q30 min FSG and Q2H calcium checks.
He was continued on levophed peripherally and was transferred to

2:01 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
2. Moderate bibasal effusions and atelectasis at the lung bases.

3. Indeterminate 11-mm left lobe of thyroid nodule which can be
further
evaluated with a nonemergent ultrasound of the thyroid.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 39 yo with depression, COPD, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
admitted with CCB ingestion in suicide attempt and resultant
hypotension requiring pressors.
.
# CCB Ingestion: Patient [**Date Range 7345**] 700 mg of amlodipine, a
dihydropyridine, which predominantly causes vasodilitation and
can also cause resultant tachycardia.  Elevated FSG is
frequently a sign of severe toxicity. Toxicology was called on
pt's arrival and serum calcium and fingersticks were closely
monitored in the ICU overnight. Pt was given a total of 2gm
calcium gluconate here. Fingersticks remained in the normal
range. A CVL was placed and levophed continued overnight and
weaned on the morning of [**2139-5-14**]. The pt remained stable on the
floor on [**2139-5-14**], and was medically cleared for discharge to
psychiatric facility on [**2139-5-14**]. Psychiatry and social work were
consulted and the pt was placed on a 1:1 sitter.
.
# Hypotension: Secondary to amlodipine ingestion and resultant
vasodilation and reflex tachycardia.  Per pt, did not ingest any
other agents.  Tox screen negative.  No reason to suspect
infection, as remains afebrile.  Urine cultures and blood
cultures were sent to rule out any infectious causes of
hypotension.  Urine cultures were negative.  Blood cultures from
[**2139-5-14**] show no growth to date on discharge, but are not yet
finalized.
.
# Tachycardia - patient was found to consistently tachycardic to
100-110s, likely compensation for vascualr vasodilation from
overdose of amlodipine.  Patient was hydrated with IVF with some
improvement, now in the 90s.  Amlodipine has a half life of
30-50hrs, will require more time before medication fully clears
his system. CTA of the chest did not show pulmonary embolism.
.
# COPD: Lungs clear.  The pt's outpatient regimen of spiriva was
continued.
.
# Depression: Pt's outpatient psychiatric regimen was held as
patient's regimen was to be readdressed once in an inpatient
psychiatric facility.
.
# F/E/N:
Regular diet, replete electrolytes as above
.
# PPX:
heparin sq
.
# Full code

FOLLOW UP:
# Thyroid nodule: Please follow up " Indeterminate 11-mm left
lobe of thyroid nodule" seen on CTA of chest.
