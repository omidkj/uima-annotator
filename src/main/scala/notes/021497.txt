extertional chest pain and dyspnea on exertion

coronary artery bypass graft x2


History of Present Illness:
This 70 year old female reports shortness of breath, belching
and chest pressure with minimal exertion relieved with rest. She
feels like she is "gasping for breath" after climbing about one
flight of stairs. The episodes are sometimes associated with
lightheadedness and diaphoresis. She reports having had several
episodes of waking up from sleep with the symptoms. She
completed a stress ECHO on [**2204-10-9**], which revealed no
evidence of
inducible ischemia at achieved workload, however, there is a
significant decrease in exercise capacity in comparison to the
last stress test from [**2197**]. She was referred for cardiac
catheterization for further evaluation. She was found to have
three vessel disease and is now being referred to cardiac
surgery
for revascularization.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was originally scheduled for surgery in mid Noven=mber but
presented to the ED on [**10-25**] with unstable angina.  On [**10-26**] she
was taken to the Operating Room where double bypass grafts were
performed. She weaned from bypass on Neo Synephrine and Propofol
in stable condition.  She awoke intact, was extubated and weaned
from pressor support.  She developed atrial fibrillation and
because of her beta blocker allergy, diltiazem was given for
rate control. Amiodarone was subsequently begun and she
converted to sinus rhythm.

She was diuresed to her preoperative weight and CTs and
temporary pacing wires were removed per protocol.  Physical
Therapy worked with her for mobility.She was transferred to
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Location (un) **] on [**11-4**] for rehabilitation and further
recovery prior to returning to her home situation.  Arrangements
were made for follow up. She had recurrent atrial fibrillation
on [**11-1**] and was given extra intravenous amiodarone and
converted to sinus.  Coumadin was begun at this point due to the
recurrent nature of the dysrhythmia.

By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to rehab in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
