LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 8.2 with 78%
neutrophils, 15% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, hematocrit 33.8,
platelets 160, MCV 112.  Chemistries remarkable for a K of
4.9, chloride 95, bicarbonate of 28, BUN 49, creatinine 3.4,
baseline 1.3 increasing to 2.1 recently, glucose of 86.  ALT
202, AST 263, amylase 182, lipase 29.  Digoxin level was 3.8.

STUDIES:  ECG:  V-paced at 70 beats per minute.  No changes
in left bundle branch pattern.

Right upper quadrant ultrasound:  Noted for ascites and
gallstones.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Respiratory status:  Patient developed progressive
respiratory distress on the floor and of unclear reasons
developed respiratory arrest necessitating intubation and
transfer to the MICU.  The etiology of this was unclear, but
thought to be due to aspiration pneumonia.  She had a
negative head CT and no seizure activity was noted at the
time.  She also was ruled out with cardiac enzymes.

She had a chest x-ray suggestive of worsening left upper lobe
opacities and was started on levo and Flagyl with sputum
cultures, which only grew out oral flora.  Part of her
respiratory decline while intubated was thought also to be
due to progressive CHF, though diuresis did not improve her
respirations.

Patient had difficulty weaning from the vent, and after much
discussion with the patient and healthcare proxy, it was
decided finally after several weeks to extubate her with
comfort measures.  The patient eventually expired.  This was
thought to be more humane way of treating the patient given
her comorbidities and likely decline if she were to have a
trach and PEG.  This was not in keeping with her former
values to be independent and not have invasive measures
performed.

2. Cardiovascular:  Patient had known CHF with known very
advanced valvular regurgitation.  After transfer to the MICU
and intubation, she was found to be in [**Month/Day (3) **] with low blood
pressures requiring pressors.  As all her cultures were
negative, etiology was not sepsis and thought to be
cardiogenic versus hypovolemic.  She was aggressively volume
resuscitated resulting in higher blood pressures, but total
body volume overload with her being nearly 15 liters positive
by the end of her admission.

Although we attempted to diurese her, she appeared to be
quite preload dependent and did not respond well to
diuretics.  She was pressor dependent until the very end when
discussions were made to have her be [**Month/Day (3) 3225**].  She was also noted
to be continually in atrial fibrillation, which also
decreased her cardiac output.  Her cardiologist and the
Cardiology team were consulted/curbsided and given her grave
medical condition, there was no benefit to cardioverting her.

3. Elevated LFTs:  Patient had negative hepatitis serologies
and acetaminophen level was normal.  Leading thought was
toxicity secondary to digoxin or amiodarone as transaminitis
decreased since these medications were stopped.  However,
patient's cardiologist believed that this may have been due
to poor cardiac output alone.

4. Acute renal failure:  Creatinine decreased after
aggressive volume resuscitation and maintaining pressors to
maintain blood pressure.  This was thought to be a prerenal,
though patient has progressively poor urine output.

5. FEN:  The patient was continued on tube feeds until
extubation.

6. Glycemic control:  Patient continued on sliding scale
insulin.

7. Code status:  Patient was initially full code, but after
extensive family discussions involving the entire staff, PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] social work as well as Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9305**] [**Name (STitle) 4261**], patient, and
nephew agreed that [**Name (NI) 3225**] status would be most keeping with her
values.  Patient was thus extubated, and pressors were weaned
off and patient was transferred to the floor.

She was maintained on oxygen and Morphine drip, and
eventually expired on [**2-1**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Expired.
