Brief Hospital Course:
#. Complete Heart Block - The patient has a history of
brady/tachy physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently
in slow atrial flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously
declined pacer placement. Now presenting with CHB, most likely
representing progression of his underlying conduction disease.
Patient is s/p permanent pacemaker now off all pressor support.
PPM set at a rate of 60 currently. Completed 3 days of
clindamycin. F/U appt in device clinic on [**1-24**]. Right pacer
dressing will be changed at that appt.
.
# Acute Respiratory failure: now resolved ?????? patient was
intubated in the setting of complete heart block episode. Major
initial barrier to extubation was patient??????s mental status.
Initially concern for possible pnuemonia given sputum production
however patient afebrile without elevated white count and
previous treated for pneumonia. Has had 2 sputum samples that
show oropharangeal flora only.
.
#. Acute on chronic Severe Biventricular Systolic Heart Failure
?????? patient maintained on Coreg and low dose lipitor. Coreg was
restarted at lower dose and [**Last Name (un) **] was started on day of discharge.
Lasix at 60 mg daily (home dose)
.
#. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely
pulmonary edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever,
recently treated for PNA with levaquin/azithromycin. Repeat
post-extubation CXR seems stable, no evidence of infection.
.
#. CAD - s/p CABG (4Vd in [**2167**])- No evidence that acute ischemia
led to CHB. Troponins on admission mildly elevated but flat in
the setting of renal failure.
Continue aspirin, beta blocker and statin
.
#. CKD - Cr 3.2 on admission, history of CKD with Cr ranging
from 2.5-3. Cr improved today to 2.5. Avoid nephrotoxins and
check lytes on Monday [**1-23**].

dementia as per his son. [**Name (NI) **] has never had a dementia workup and
drove his car until recently. He is alert, calm, but with very
poor short term memory at this time. Has not needed Haldol in 24
hours. Pt will require fall precautions. An appt with a
geriatrician is scheduled at the memory clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] for

Please avoid benzodiazepines and anti-cholinergic medications
.
# Hematuria: resulting from foley trauma, no evidence of
infection. Bright red this am with tiny clots. Bladder scanned
and showed 165cc after 6 hours. Flomax restarted. Consider
continuous Foley irrigation if hematuria worsens. Push PO's of
thickened liquids.
.
#. HTN ?????? chronic. Well controlled on carvedilol and Losartan.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia - continue statin
.
#. Dysphagia: chronic cough concerning for silent aspiration.
Speech and swallow evaluation recommended ground solids with
nectar thick liquid, medications whole.
.
#. Uticaria: pt has macular red rash on lower back, thought to
be contact dermatitis. [**Name2 (NI) 6398**] lotion has been used successfully
for pruritis.
