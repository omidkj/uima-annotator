Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred for stenting of right mainstem bronchus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Bronchoscopy with bronchial stent removal.

History of Present Illness:
80 yo man w/ h/o Stage 3B lung cancer (s/p chemo, XRT, and stent
placement [**5-12**]), COPD on home O2, CAD (multivessel disease and
80% LM stenosis), A fib, and LLE DVT who presents from OSH with
obstructed right sided bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonia
for possible stenting.  On [**6-28**] the patient underwent
bronchoscopy which showed tumor occluding the stent which was
partially removed.  After this procedure, the patient went into
respiratory distress in the PACU and required intubation.  He
was also noted to have ST elevations on EKG in leads V2 and V3.
STAT echo revealed EF of 25%, decreased from 60% in [**2115-5-8**].
The patient was admitted to the MICU at the OSH for further
management.
.
On transfer to the MICU, the patient was hypotensive to the 70's
systolic which responded to IV fluid bolus.  Cardiology was
consulted regarding his ST elevations and recommended medical
management with addition of plavix for his left main disease.
Eventually, the patient was also started on low dose metoprolol
and captopril after his blood pressure stabilized.  The
following morning, his ST elevations had normalized.
Cardiology felt that his previous changes were due to myocardial
stunning.  During his OSH MICU course, he was also found to have
focal neuro deficits (left ptosis, left facial droop) so a head
CT was done.  This study revealed an old right parietal infarct
with moderate chronic small vessel infarcts without evidence of
enhancing lesions.
.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible stenting of
his right sided bronchial occlusion.  He was hemodynamically
stable on arrival, and denied CP, SOB, abdominal pain, headache,
or dizziness.

CXR was done showing complete whiteout of the right lung [**1-9**] to
post-obstructive pneumonia.  He was started on Vanco and Zosyn
for treatment of pneumonia.  Chest CT the following day revealed
bilateral pleural effusions (R>L), complete RUL/RML/RLL collapse
with apparent obstruction of the bronchial stent within the
right main stem bronchus.

Past Medical History:
- Stage 3B Lung Cancer: dx [**2114-10-8**]; s/p 8 courses of
chemo; s/p XRT; s/p stent in right bronchus [**5-12**]; s/p 5

OSH LABS:
WBC=5.0; Hct=23.8; plts=154
Na=135; K=4.0; Cl=110; CO2=22; BUN=9; Cr=0.8; glucose=163
INR=1.0

.
PORTABLE CXR @ OSH ([**7-2**]): improvement in vascular congestion
and slight alveolar fluid from yesterday.  Persistent
opacification of the right hemithorax.
.
CT CHEST @ OSH ([**6-29**]):
1) Large right sided pleural effusion and moderate size left
sided pleural effusion.
2) Complete collapse of the RUL, RLL, and RML with apparent
obstruction of bronchial stent within the right main stem
bronchus and soft tissue mass in the azygoesophageal recess
likely representing patient's known lung cancer.
3) Emphysematous changes throughout the LUL w/ septal thickening
which may be due to scarring, atelectasis although no
lymphangitic spread of disease cannot be entirely excluded.
4) Areas of compressive atelectasis within the LLL. Incidental
note is made of infrarenal AAA (2.9 x 2.4 cm).

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt bronched [**7-3**], showing right main bronchus stent frayed at
distal end, blocking RUL and with thick secretions distally.
Left bronchus was patent. Overnight [**7-3**], patient was was
hypotensive; did not respond to IVF bolus and PRBCs.  Low dose
Dopamine started with improvement of BP.  ~20 min after dopamine
started, patient went into RVR.  Dopamine stopped.  Amiodarone
started, patient still tachycardic and hypotensive.  At this
point, patient underwent synchronized cardioversion (200 and
then 300 joules), did not convert to NSR, but rate became more
controlled in low 100's.  Levophed started for BP control,
subsequently weaned off [**7-4**], converted to NS on amiodarone
drip.

Pt never weaned off mechanical ventilation through his hospital
course.  Spontaneous breathing trials were poorly tolerated.  In
addition, his cardiovascular function was tenuous.  He had acute
drop in blood pressure with cardiac enzyme leak on [**7-11**] and
throughout his course remained intermittently hypotensive and
also bradycardic at times.  Per family request pressor were not
given.  It became clear given the patients invasive lung cancer
and severe coronary artery disease that the prognosis was
extremely poor.   On [**2115-7-12**] a family meeting was held.  The
outcome of this was that pt would remain intubated but would
also still be DNR and would be given no escalation in care
including pressors or antiarrhythmics.  The family asked whether
it would be possible to send pt home on ventilator so that he
may spend his last days at home.  Such arrangements were made
but required that the patient undergo tracheostomy.
Unfortunately the patient was never sufficiently hemodynamically
stable that this procedure could safely be performed.

On [**2115-7-19**] another family meeting was held.  It was explained
that tracheostomy was not possible to perform safely and that
the patient would probably spend the remainder of his days in
the hospital.  The daughters decided that care should move
toward comfort measures only.  Efforts were made to pursue care
such that the patient would remain alive over the weekend so
that he may have visitors.  Of note the patient was noted to
disseminated multi-drug resistant Klebsiella infection by blood
culture, sputum culture, and urine culture.  No antibiotics wore
started.  Comfort measure only care was instituted in full on
[**7-22**] with the goal of making the patient comfortable.  The
patient went into respiratory failure on  the evening of [**7-23**]
and expired that night.  Attending was duly notified.  The
family was notified.  Autopsy was declined.

In summary Mr [**Known lastname 24642**], is an 80 year-old gentleman with a
history of stage 3b terminal lung cancer, atrial fibrillation
and severe coronary artery disease who presented with hypoxic
respiratory failure requring intubation that was
