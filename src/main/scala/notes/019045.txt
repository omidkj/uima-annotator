Admission Date: [**2184-4-21**]        Discharge Date: [**2184-4-26**]


Service:  CCU


DATE OF DEATH:  [**2184-4-26**] at 5:10 a.m.

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  He was admitted to the CCU on [**2184-4-21**]
status post cardiac catheterization complicated by
cardiogenic shock.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
male with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia
status post CABG, status post PCI with 3 weeks of
intermittent chest pain.  He was admitted after a presyncopal
episode, fatigue and heart block.  The patient was taken for
emergent cardiac catheterization, which revealed 2-vessel
disease with SVG, PCI and stenting.  The patient was in
cardiogenic shock and brought to the CCU on intra-aortic
balloon pump.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.9, blood
pressure was 94/50, respiratory rate was 16, and saturating
at 98 percent.  Vented on AC 0.4, 612, 5, 24.  PAPs of 55/29,
mean was 30, cardiac output 3.4, cardiac index 1.91, [**Doctor First Name **] 0.5
on the right, 0.73 on left.  Telemetry sinus rhythm, no
ectopy.  Generally, the patient was in no acute distress with
the pupils responsive today.  Heart:  Regular rate and
rhythm.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anterolaterally with
coarse breath sounds at the bases.  Abdomen is soft with
positive bowel sounds and nondistended.  Trace edema in the
extremities.  All pulses were dopplerable.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 8.6, hematocrit 29.6, platelet
count 121, neutrophils 78, bands 8, and INR 1.3.  Sodium 143,
potassium 4.3, chloride 108, bicarbonate 21, BUN 16 and
creatinine 2.7 and glucose is 132.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiogenic shock:  The patient was brought
to the CCU on Levophed.  Levophed was weaned and the patient
was maintained on intra-aortic balloon pump throughout his
first day in the CCU.  The patient's intra-aortic balloon
pump was subsequently discontinued on [**2184-4-22**] for
cardiogenic shock and CHF and volume overload.  The patient
was maintained initially on Lasix and nitrates, and
eventually switched to Natrecor.  The patient's creatinine
went from 2.7 to 3.3, felt likely secondary to contrast.  The
patient's Foley was flushed without any effect.
Additionally, the Natrecor was then discontinued secondary to
hypotension.

Procedure:  The patient was maintained on Isordil, beta
blocker and ACE inhibitors, once the Natrecor and Lasix were
discontinued.  The patient's creatinine, however, did not
improve and rose to a max of 5.6.  The patient continued to
remain in fluid-overloaded state.

Prevention:  The patient was maintained on aspirin, Plavix
and Lipitor.

FEN:  The patient was NPO and G-tube was in place.  The
patient was maintained on b.i.d. PPI.

Hematologic:  The patient had decreased hematocrit secondary
to ooze from line sites and hematuria.  DIC laboratories were
sent and were negative.  The patient was transfused p.r.n.

The patient's code status:  A long discussion took place
between Medicine's senior resident and the family and the
patient's grim prognosis was discussed with the family.
Goals of care were reiterated and the patient was made
comfort measures only.  The patient passed away at 5:10 a.m.
on [**2184-4-26**].  No autopsy was obtained.
