Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]/MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84 year old
male with severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of
0.6 square centimeters, coronary artery disease, status post
stent placement in [**2171-5-23**], complicated by in-stent
restenosis in [**2172-7-22**], who was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2173-6-9**], with right lower
quadrant pain.

He was diagnosed with a right lower quadrant abscess,
possibly related to diverticulosis and underwent percutaneous
drainage on [**2173-6-10**].  Cultures grew out a mixture of alpha
streptococcus and streptococcus milleri, haemophilus, and D.
fragilis.  The patient was initially treated at that time
with Ampicillin, Gentamicin and Flagyl and was subsequently
changed to Unasyn.

After the patient's abdominal drain was removed, the patient
was sent to rehabilitation.  The patient completed his course
of Unasyn on [**2173-6-27**].  Within the next 72 hours, the patient
developed recurrent fevers while at rehabilitation.

On [**2173-6-30**], the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] for investigation of recurrent right
lower quadrant pain.  CT scan revealed a 5.6 by 2.8
centimeter fluid pocket in his right lower quadrant.  This
fluid pocket communicated with the skin by a sinus tract from
the prior drain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission,
the vital signs were notable for a temperature of 100.1.
Heart rate was in the 60s.  The blood pressure was 98/50.
The patient was saturating 100% in room air.  In general, the
patient appeared weak and ill appearing.  The patient's head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was notable for a
normocephalic and atraumatic head.  The extraocular movements
were intact.  The neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
The lung examination revealed lungs which were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed an irregular pulse, irregular heart sounds with a
III/VI systolic crescendo, decrescendo murmur at the right
upper sternal border.  Abdominal examination revealed
positive bowel sounds, soft, mildly distended abdomen with
the right lower quadrant tenderness.  The extremities showed
2+ edema bilaterally.  Neurologically, the patient was
grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, laboratory data was notable
for a white blood cell count of 14.0.  A hematocrit was 27.2.
The platelet count was 229,000.  The differential was 89%
neutrophils and 6% lymphocytes.  The sodium level was 130,
potassium 3.5, chloride 93, bicarbonate 25, blood urea
nitrogen 44, creatinine 1.4 and the glucose was 152.  Digoxin
level was 1.4.  Urinalysis revealed trace blood, 0-2 red
blood cells, [**2-23**] white blood cells and rare bacteria.

Abdominal CT revealed the aforementioned 5.6 by 2.8
centimeter fluid collection in the right lower quadrant.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was originally admitted to the
Acove Service.  He underwent a drainage procedure for the
right lower quadrant abscess on [**2173-7-1**].  Over the course of
his hospitalization on the Acove Service, the patient
developed acute renal failure with a rising creatinine to 2.8
with an admission value of 1.4.  Urinary output decreased and
the patient developed increasing edema.

The patient also developed episodes of bradycardia with heart
rate dropping to the 30s.  Initially, these episodes of
bradycardia were asymptomatic.  However, the patient
subsequently developed episodes of recurrent bradycardia with
heart rate into the 20s.  With these episodes, the patient
became presyncopal.  The episodes resolved spontaneously at
least once Atropine was given but the heart rate did not
improve.  The Electrophysiology Service was consulted.  They
recommended discontinuation of Digoxin which was done.

The patient developed increasing dyspnea over his hospital
course.  His secretions increased as did his oxygen
requirement.  His respiratory status improved somewhat with
an increase in his Lasix dosing.

On the night of [**2173-7-10**], the patient developed frequent
pauses in his ventricular response to his atrial fibrillation
lasting up to six seconds at a time.  With these pauses in
ventricular response, the patient was noted to have "his eyes
rolling back into his head" and unresponsiveness.  At that
time, the Electrophysiology Service was reconsulted and the
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for transvenous pacemaker
placement.

A VVI pacemaker was placed externally with a temporary wire
to the right ventricle.  The patient was stable after
pacemaker placement in the Intensive Care Unit from the
standpoint of his cardiac rhythm.  The pacemaker was placed
externally on the upper right chest wall and was dressed and
taped in place.

The patient's subsequent Intensive Care Unit course was
notable for worsening of his respiratory status.  Chest
x-rays were notable for the appearance of probable multilobar
pneumonia.  The patient's p.o. intake decreased due to lack
of appetite.  The patient was maintained on intravenous
antibiotics.  Permanent pacemaker implantation was deferred
because of ongoing questions of infection related to his
abdomen and subsequently to his multilobar pneumonia.

Extensive meetings with the patient and his family were held
regarding the patient's wishes for continuation of intensive
treatment.  The patient decided that his goals for care were
to return to the home, deferring more intensive in-hospital
care for his multiple medical problems.

The patient decided that he did not want to pursue
resuscitation and was made "Do Not Resuscitate".  On further
discussions with the patient regarding his prognosis, the
patient determined that he wished to return home and no
longer pursue in-hospital care.

Due to the patient's poor prognosis, Hospice Services were
determined to be the most appropriate in home care method for
the patient and his family.  At the time of this dictation on
[**2173-7-13**], the patient is to discharge the patient home with
Hospice care on [**2173-7-14**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to home on
[**2173-7-14**], with home hospice care.
