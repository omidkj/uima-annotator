Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hematochezia

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64 year old man
with several medical problems listed below.  He was in his
usual state of health until four to five months ago when he
began to experience a significant weight loss (total 30
pounds).  He also appreciated the development of relatively
painless jaundice.  He stated that he lost his appetite
completely and is nauseated most of the time.

The patient was scheduled for endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatitis beyond the date of admission, however,
laboratory evaluation prior to the procedure revealed a
markedly elevated INR (greater than 18).  The procedure was
scrapped.  The patient received Vitamin K 10 mg
subcutaneously and was admitted to the Medical Service
pending return of his INR to the normal range.  Once admitted
to the Medical Floor he passed approximately 200 cc of blood
per rectum without pain.  He remained awake, comfortable and
normal and had normal blood pressures throughout this,
however, he was tachycardiac to approximately 100
beats/minute.  This rate did not respond to fluid
resuscitation.  He received a total of 2 liters of normal
saline prior to transfer to the Intensive Care Unit.

depressed appetite as described above.

hearing loss or difficulty swallowing.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 10, 500,

Sodium 137, potassium 2.7, chloride 94, bicarbonate 31, blood

ALT 200, AST 148, alkaline phosphatase 244, total bilirubin
10.2, amylase 40, lipase 24, carcinoembryonic antigen was
6.9. CA19-9 was pending at the time of this dictation.
Repeat hematocrit was 43.1.

The patient underwent abdominal imaging showing a mass in the
porta hepatis as well as a calcified mass in the right upper
pole of the right kidney.  Arrangements were made for him to
undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy, endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography and possibly colonoscopy after the
computerized tomography scan was obtained.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After admission to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit the patient had his INR reversed completely with a
total of 4 units of fresh frozen plasma.  He also received
transfusion of 1 unit of packed red cells.  The patient
underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.  An
incomplete of the lower third of the common bile duct was
identified with proximal dilation.  Intraductal ultrasound
confirmed that the lesion was not a stone.  There was
bleeding from the site of compression.  A stent was placed
with passage of clotted blood.  Plans for a more detailed
esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were scrapped
owing to the finding of hemobilia.  The patient was returned
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit after question of
cytologic samples and brushings.  At the time of this
dictation the results of those pathological examinations are
pending.

On the day following his endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography he was found to have stable
hematocrit, electrolytes had returned to [**Location 213**] as had his
INR.  However, his amylase and lipase were markedly elevated
(amylase was 1,062, lipase was [**Numeric Identifier 52792**]), however, the patient
had no pain.  His diet was slowly advanced.

Hepatobiliary Surgery consultation was obtained.  Plans for
surgery are pending at the time of this dictati
