CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted postoperative for right femoral
popliteal bypass surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year-old
male with coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular
disease, who underwent an elective right femoral popliteal
arterial bypass graft on [**2177-1-1**] complicated by
postoperative chest pain with ST depressions in V4 through
V6, which were worsening with the chest pain.  He was seen by
cardiology postoperatively who recommended cycling enzymes.
The third set of CKs became positive and were rising with a
CK of 460 troponin of 22.  At that point electrocardiogram
changes had resolved.  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2176-1-3**].  On cardiac
catheterization the saphenous vein graft to posterior
descending coronary artery graft showed a distal 95% lesion,
which when crossed with a wire became occluded leading to
fallen blood pressure and cardiogenic shock.  Catheter was
withdrawn, intraaortic balloon pump was placed.  The patient
was intubated.  Catheter accessed then was gained by the left
radial artery and the saphenous vein graft posterior
descending coronary artery was stented, but initially showed
no reflow, but ultimately achieved reflow.  The patient left
the cardiac catheterization laboratory intubated on Dopamine
and Dobutamine as well as Levophed with wide complex
tachycardia, which was thought to be a sinus tachycardia with
apparent conduction or junctional rhythm with systolic blood
pressure in the 90s.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
3.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2147**] with an saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending coronary artery.  In [**2158**] had a redo
saphenous vein graft posterior descending coronary artery as
well as an saphenous vein graft left circumflex.  In [**2164**] the
patient underwent cardiac catheterization with a total
occlusion of the left circumflex with patent posterior
descending coronary artery graft feeding the left anterior
descending coronary artery via collaterals.  There was no
left internal mammary coronary artery graft.  ETT in [**2174-12-26**] showed an EF of 51% with no evidence of reversible
defects.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease diagnosed in [**2175-1-26**]
status post left iliac stent, recent onset of right
intermittent claudication and an angiogram showing 80% common
femoral artery occlusion.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Diltiazem 90 mg po t.i.d.
2.  Cefazolin.
3.  Lopressor.
4.  Aspirin.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Intravenous Lopressor.
2.  Dobutamine.
3.  Dopamine.
4.  Levophed.
5.  Propofol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE CORONARY CARE UNIT:
temperature afebrile.  Blood pressure 80 to 110 systolic over
60 to 80 diastolic.  Heart rte in the 130 to 150 range.
Sting 98%.  In general, the patient is sedated and intubated.
HEENT extraocular movements intact.  Pupils are equal, round
and reactive to light and accommodation.  ET tube in place.
Neck right IJ in place.  Lungs rhoncherous throughout all
fields.  Cardiovascular examination tachycardic, normal S1
and S2.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities right groin surgical dressing in
place.  Left groin with arterial and venous sheaths in place.
 Right foot is cold.  Left foot is cold.  There is warmth
beginning above the ankle.

LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER:  White blood cell count 20.9,
hematocrit 33.0, platelets 235, INR 1.4, sodium 134,
potassium 4.9, chloride 99, bicarbonate 20, BUN 15,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 385.  Arterial blood gas on admission
7.27, CO2 42, PO2 78, bicarbonate of 20.  Chest x-ray showed
congestive heart failure.  ET tube 68 cm above the carina,
right IJ with swan in [**MD Number(3) 50365**] right, no effusions.  Aortic
balloon pump in place.  Catheterization showed markedly
elevated filling pressures with cardiogenic shock presenting
to laboratory.  Cardiac output 4.41, cardiac index 2.04,
after the intervention changed to an output of 4.58 and an
index of 2.12.  The left heart catheterization showed a right
dominant system with left main with diffuse disease, 80%
distal left main disease with a slow flow in the left
anterior descending coronary artery, right coronary artery
was occluded.  The saphenous vein graft to right coronary
artery with 90% distal stenosis, calcified thrombotic severe.
 Electrocardiograms showed normal sinus rhythm and rate with
normal axis, nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay,
ST depressions in V4 through V6, 2 in AVF.  Post
catheterization there is a wide complex tachycardia at 123
with junctional tachycardia with aberrant conduction, QRS was
172 milliseconds, ST elevations in V2 through V4.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 71 year-old male with coronary
artery disease, diabetes mellitus type two, peripheral
vascular disease admitted to the Coronary Care Unit post
complicated emergent catheterization while in cardiogenic
shock post myocardial infarction arrived to the Coronary Care
Unit on pressors and intubated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiovascular:  The patient has known
three vessel disease now with a new stent in the saphenous
vein graft, posterior descending coronary artery, which
apparently supplies the bulk of the myocardium given the lack
of flow in the left system, presumably the blood supply by
collaterals now status post right coronary artery stent with
ultimate restoration of flow.  The patient was started on
Plavix, aspirin, Integrilin and was initially unable to start
a beta blocker given the fact that he was on high doses of
multiple pressors including Levophed, Dopamine and
Dobutamine.  Intraaortic balloon pump was also in place for
blood pressure supported perfusion.  On [**2177-1-3**] the
patient was slowly weaned of the Dopamine and the Dobutamine
and had decreasing doses of Propofol and decrease doses of
Levophed with a decreased oxygen requirement.  The aspirin,
Plavix and Atorvastatin were continued.  The patient was
autodiuresing without the need for diuretics or an ace
inhibitor.  At about 3:00 p.m. on [**1-3**] the patient
became more tachycardic with occasional premature ventricular
contractions and then with some runs of 2 to 3 beats.  The
patient then suddenly became tachycardic to 140 and had long
runs of ventricular tachycardia and was shocked multiple
times, transiently regained a pulse, however, degenerated
into V fibrillation and was shocked several times.

At this point the family who was present felt that further
intervention including shock, pressors and ventilatory
support should be discontinued as the patient's original code
status was DNR/DNI, however, the family felt that they wanted
to at least give the patient a chance to see if the coronary
artery reperfusion improved his chances of living.  However,
after seeing that he was now in refractory V fibrillation
they did not want to pursue any further life support
measures.  The code was stopped at 3:57 p.m. at which point
the patient expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Cardiopulmonary arrest.
2.  Cardiogenic shock.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.
7.  Status post right femoral popliteal bypass graft on
[**2177-1-1**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Expired.
