CTA Head [**2124-12-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, unchanged since the recent prior CT
with no
evidence of hydrocephalus.
2. Three aneurysms arising from the ACOM, left MCA and right
superior
cerebellar arteries as described above, with the left MCA
aneurysm being
liekly ruptured given the sentinel clot appearance at this
focus. Pl. see the subsequent conventional angiogram report for
details.

Renal Ultrasound [**2124-12-27**]:
IMPRESSION: No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of polycystic kidney
disease. 8-mm
echogenic focus in left kidney may represent crystals in
caliceal diverticulum or nonshadowing, nonobstructing stone.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 89506**] was taken emergently to the neurointerventional suite
and had a coiling of a right mca aneursym that appeared to be
the cause of her bleed. 2 additional aneursyms were also found:
5x3AComm and 4x3R PCA. Those were not treated initially. She was
admitted directly to the ICU with Q1 neurochecks, she was
started on Nimodipine, her SBP was kept less than 160.She was
neurologically intact. On [**12-27**] she went back to the
neurointerventional suite and undewent a coiling of the ACA and
basilar tip aneurysm. Post-angio she did well. She underwent a
renal ultrasound to rule out polycystic kidney disease- which
was negative.

On [**12-28**] she had TCDs which showed R MCA - moderate vasospasm but
asymptomatic and did not require any intervention other than
close neurochecks and IV fluids. Her IV fluids were decreassed
over a three day period, her Dilantin was discontinued and she
was transferred to neuroscience floor. She has remained
neurologically stable throughout her stay. A CTA was negative
for spasm. She was discharged on [**2125-1-2**], her headaches were well
controlled. She will continue on Nimodipine at home.
