History of Present Illness:
88yo F fell early [**9-14**] found late in the day by her son. She
normally lives alone and is self sufficient. After fall, she has
a humerus/radius fracture, C-spine fractures, 4cm facial
laceration, and 6cm scalp laceration.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought in after sustaining a fall at home. She
was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] and imaging studies revealed comminuted,
impacted and angulated left humeral surgical neck fracture with
large amount of surrounding soft tissue hematoma and   fracture
through the left distal radius, with dorsal displacement and
overriding of the major distal fracture fragment. She also
sustained spinous process fracture at C5, and at C6.  There was
evidence of ligamentous injury of the cervix. The patient was
taken to the OR by the orthopedic spine service and underwent
C4-C7 laminectomy and fusion - please refer to operative note
for more details. After this operation, her L arm fractures were
addressed in the same setting.

She was also noted to have a T2 fracture for which she was
fitted with a SOMA brace. She is to wear this when out of bed.

Post-operatively, she remained ventilated and was recovered in
the surgical ICU. She had pulmonary congestion and RLL
consolidation on CXR which prompted starting levofloxacin on
[**2140-9-17**] for pneumonia. These were changed to vancomycin and
cefepime on [**2140-9-19**], after her ventilatory status and fever
curve did not improve. She completed a course of vancomycin and
cefepime for pneumonia on [**2140-10-5**].

She continued to be ventilator-dependent and was tenuous,
oscillating between pulmonary congestion and contraction
alkylosis. She ultimately became euvolemic. On [**2140-9-28**], due to
continued ventilator dependence and tube feed dependence, she
underwent tracheostomy and feeding gastrostomy placement.

On [**2140-10-7**], she again had copious thick respiratory secretions,
her WBC was high at 13.2, she was again requiring full
ventilatory support and she had a consolidation in the RLL. She
was restarted on vancomycin, cefepime and cipro for ongoing
pneumonia. She finished this course on [**2140-10-12**] and has remained
very well with reassuring respiratory status and CXRs. She has
diarrhea with a flexiseal in place, but had 3 negative tests for
C. difficile. This is improving.

She worked with physical therapy and was out of bed to chair
during her stay. She has no limitations of weight-bearing on the
lower extremities or right upper extremity. Her left arm is
non-weight-bearing.

At discharge on [**2140-10-13**], she is tolerating goal tube feeds
without issue. She is on and off trach collar, going back to
pressure-support ventilation when she tires. She is alert and
communicative with a Passey-Muir valve when she is able to be on
trach collar. Her pain is well under control.
