History of Present Illness:
84F admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2134-12-26**] with lower abdominal
pain and hypotension found to have diverticulitis on CT scan and
was admitted to the ICU. Pt was also found to be in acure renal
failure with a Cr of 2.7 (baseline 0.8). Pt was hyponatremic
with a Na of 121 at time of admission. On [**1-5**] pt
underwent exploratory laparotomy with sigmoid resection,
[**Doctor Last Name 3379**] and end colostomy. Intraoperatively she had a 1cm hole
in her sigmoid colon and feculent peritonitis. Pt extubated on
[**2135-1-8**], was reintubated the same day and has remained intubated
since. Since reintubation, pt has been minimally responsive with
minimal improvement - occasionally moving her arms and and legs
and rarely opening her eyes. She was alert and oriented at the
time of admission to OSH. Upon transfer the pt has a pressor
requirement on Levophed. Pt is approximately 15 kilos positive
since her admission on [**12-26**]. She has had multiple
brinchoscopies for persistent partial left lung collapse at the
OSH. Pt has had rectal bleeding since [**2135-1-16**], continuously
draining small amounts of blood. Pt recieved one unit of PRBC
overnight [**Date range (1) 48570**] with her last HCT 31.5. Pt transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-17**] for further managemnet of LGIB.

CT head: 1. Interval near-complete opacification of the mastoid
air cells bilaterally, with scattered air-fluid levels. Fluid in
the nasopharynx, likely related to intubation.
2. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

CT abd: 1. Multicystic area in the mid-to-upper left hemothorax,
poorly evaluated on this technically limited study, demonstrates
multiple air-fluid levels within cystic spaces. This may
represent loculated hydropneumothorax such as due to
hemopneumothorax or empyema, or alternatively infection or
hemorrhage within bullae (although no bullae were noted in this
region on the prior study, there is evidence of severe
emphysema). Repeat CT scanning with a dedicated Chest CT
protocol would likely be helpful for further clarification.
2. New since the prior exam are multiple peribronchovascular
nodules and
ground-glass opacities in the left upper lung, consistent with
infectious or inflammatory process.
3. 2.3 x 6.5 cm new hemorrhagic fluid collection in the anterior
peritoneal cavity, adjacent to the surgical incision along the
anterior abdominal wall. Density in deep pelvis may represent
free hemoperitoneum or possibly a loop of bowel.
Limited evaluation of the pelvis and the surgical bed due to
technical
problems encountered with the scan. Additionally, oral contrast
does not
reach the distal bowel. Recommend rescanning the patient after
contrast has passed more distally, for better visualization of
deep pelvic contents.
4. Borderline enlarged loops of proximal small bowel, without
other evidence of obstruction.
5. Cholelithiasis.
6. Atherosclerotic disease.

MRI head: Extensive small vessel ischemic change. Tiny acute
infarction in the right parietal lobe in a periventricular
location, without associated mass effect or edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
84F tx from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2135-1-17**] with h/o perf
diverticulitis s/p ex lap, sigmoid colectomy with [**Doctor Last Name 3379**]
([**1-5**]). Post-op course c/b hypoxia in setting of LUL collapse
requiring re-intubation [**1-11**], somnolence, renal failure. Head CT
demonstrated small vessel disease. Multiple bronchoscopies for
persistent partial left upper lobe collapse at [**Hospital3 **]
as well as thoracentesis. On [**1-16**], she developed small amounts
of rectal bleeding, and received 1 U PRBCs overnight. Hematocrit
stable. On transfer, she was on a Levophed gtt, minimally
responsive, withdrawing to pain, massive generalized edema and
had gained ~33 pounds since admission to OSH.

After admission to the intensive care unit, Dr.[**Name (NI) 11471**] surgical
service, respiratory status was a concern. Chest CT c/w
pulmonary abscesses and she was placed of Vancomycin, Cipro, and
Zosyn. Her hemodynamics improved while her mental status was
very slow to recover. She was placed on escalating doses of
levothyroxine as she had persistently elevated TSH values. Over
the days of [**12-14**], her white blood cell counts fell
dramatically, requiring neutropenia precautions. Hematology
performed a bone marrow biopsy and viral and fungal studies were
sent. ID recommended adjusting her antibiotic regimen and to
treat empirically for C. difficile.

Her remaining hospital course can be summarized by the following
review of systems:

Neuro: Patient's mental status continue to wax and wane. She
will respond and move all extremities on command. Initially, due
to initial hypotensive phase, requiring pressors, concerns were
for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. MRI and CT of her head did
not show any acute processes
