Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
ST-elevation myocardial infarction, transferred from OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization x2 ([**2109-11-12**], [**2109-11-15**])

History of Present Illness:
A 59yoM with DM, HTN, ESRD on HD presnted to OSH with subacute
altered mental status. Per family, patient has had trouble
walking, intermittently slurred speech, non-sensical speech,
decreased memory and lethargy over the past 3-6 weeks. Of note,
he may have been taking Vicodin at home for his ankle pain. In
the ED, neurology evaluated the patient and thought he had a
mild encehpolpathy of unknown etiology. He was alert and
oriented x3, able to follow commands.
In the ED, CT head negative. They told him he was unsafe to
leave and needed admitted. He refused and then psych was called
who found him to be unalbe to make decisions. He then became
very agitated and was given 0.5 ativan and 2mg haldol. He then
became more agitatied and was given benedryl 50mg for agitation.

Then he became HTN (SBP>200), and hypoxic (85%) and felt to have
pulmonary edema. He was given 80 lasix IV and nitropaste and
10mg Zyprexa. He was then subsequently intubated for pulmonary
edema and agitation and admitted to the MICU. There he was
hypertensive to the 230's. In dialysis, he dropped his pressure
to the 70's and then his BP meds were stopped.
Tox screen was + for benzos (had ativan), neg for opiates. ESR
22B12 476, folic acid 3.7, TSH 1.2.
On [**11-11**] @338AM - his EKG showed SR@92, 1-2mm STE in II, III
(nl/small Q waves) and 4mm STD in V2, V3 with lateral TWI.
On [**11-11**] @ 810AM - SR@66 with inferior Qs and hyperacute Ts
4am Trop: 0.85 CK: 299 MB: 14
12pm Trop: 30.0 CK: 779 MB: 57
5pm Trop: 33.0 CK: 673 MB: 44
Echo showed severe inferior wall hypokinesis/akinesis, EF ~45%
with 3+ MR; no pericardial effusion.
WBC ct: 11; HCt: 36.5; Ca: 10.6; TSH 1.2
CXR: On admission showed CHF
In AM of [**11-11**], dialysis was stopped because of hypotension
(500cc taken off).
He received heparin, ASA.

Pertinent Results:

PSA = 1.0
.
ECG [**2109-11-17**]: There is new first degree A-V block. Anterior wall
ST segment depressions persist and are unchanged.
.
CXR [**2109-11-16**]: Comparison with [**2109-11-14**], the right IJ
central venous catheter, and nasogastric tubes remain in
position. Since the prior exam, there has been improvement in
the underlying pulmonary vascular congestion throughout both
lungs. There is however persistent interstitial pulmonary edema
most notable in the perihilar distribution. No alveolar
pulmonary edema is identified. There is mild blunting of the
left costophrenic angle, which likely represents a small
effusion. No focal infiltrate is identified. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. There is degenerative change of the
thoracolumbar spine.
.
ECG [**2109-11-15**]: Inferior ST segment elevation and anterior ST
segment depression have improved.
.
Cath [**2109-11-15**]: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system revealed significant obstructive coronary artery
disease.  The left main coronary artery was without angiographic
evidence of significant obstructive coronary artery disease.
The left anterior descending had a 30% ostial stenosis.  There
was no significant obstructive coronary artery disease in the
mid or distal LAD.  The left circumflex was proximally occluded.
The ramus branch was a large vessel with an subtotal occlusion
at the ostium.  The right coronary artery was without
angiographic evidence of significant obstructive coronary artery
disease in the proximal or mid segment.  There was a total
occlusion in the distal RCA (unchanged from three days prior).
2. Successful PCI of the proximal ramus with a 3.5 x 18 mm
Cypher [**Month/Day/Year **] (see PTCA comments). 3. Left femoral arteriotomy site
was closed with an 8 French Angioseal closure device. FINAL
DIAGNOSIS: 1. Significant obstructive coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of the ramus intermedius.
.
EEG [**2109-11-14**]: Largely normal portable EEG for sleep. Drowsiness
and sleep dominated the record. There were no areas of focal
slowing although sleep can obscure such findings. There were no
epileptiform features.
.
Head MRI/MRA 12/29/05:1. Mild brain atrophy. 2. Left scalp
lipoma. 3. Unremarkable circle of [**Location (un) 431**] MRA.
.
Echo [**2109-11-12**]: LVEF>55%. The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
Cath [**2109-11-12**]: 1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant patient revealed two vessel (three counting Ramus)
coronary artery disease. The LMCA was heavily calcifeid with
diffuse plaquing to 20%. The LAD was heavily calcified with
septal collaterals to rPDA and origin 20-30% lesion.  The LCX
was moderately calcified with stump occlusion of AV groove CX
with delayed filling via both antegrade and ramus collaterals.
The Ramus intermedius had an ostial 95% stenosis and supplied
collaterals to rPDA.  The RCA was heavily calcified with
proximal 30%, mid 40%, and distal 50% lesions. The origins to
both rPDA and RPL were occluded. 2. Resting hemodynamics
revealed mild elevation of left and right sided filling
pressures with RA of 11mmHG and PCWP of 15mmHG. There was mild
pulmonary hypertension with mean PA of 26mmHG.  The cardiac
index was preserved at 3.3 (pt was on ventilator at time of
cath). There was no gradient on aortic valve pullback. 3. Known
systolic dysfunction with EF45% with inferior akinesis.  Due to
anatomy, EF and diabetes patient referred for CABG. FINAL
DIAGNOSIS: 1. Two vessel coronary artery disease of LCX, RCA and
Ramus 2. Moderate LV diastolic and known LV systolic (echo with
EF 45%) heart failure with preserved cardiac index.
.
CXR [**2109-11-12**]: Mild congestive heart failure.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo man with multiple cardiac risk factors w/ ESRD presents
with STEMI and mental status change x 6 weeks.
.
##Cardiac:
#ISCHEMIA: Peak CK 779. Cath [**11-12**] w/2VD, considered CABG,
however, CT surgery wanted mental status changes worked up
first.  No h/o angina.  Likely had chronic total occlusions and
demand ischemia in setting of acute stress and anxiety at OSH.
Pt had sub-sternal chest pain on [**11-15**] with ECG changes and went
to cath where [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] to ramus was performed.  It was felt
that plaque migration was responsible for the increase in LAD
occlusion on the second catheterization.  Given successful
revascularization with
