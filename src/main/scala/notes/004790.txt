Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, L arm pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention
Trans-esophageal echocardiogram.


History of Present Illness:
In summary, he is a 78M h/o bladder CA, HTN, no other known
cardiac hx presented to [**Hospital1 15331**] ED with L arm pain and SOB. The
daugher helped provide some of the history as well. Three weeks
ago he started having intermittent symptoms of L arm and neck
pain with exertion. On Sunday coming out of church with his
family, he had a syncopal episode, and awoke quickly and was
back to his baseline, not presenting for care at that point.
Several days PTA, he developed SOB and wheezing and continued to
have intermittent L arm pain. He presented to the ED at [**Hospital1 15331**]
on [**3-3**] in the AM and was discharged because they suspected
musculoskeletal pain. He went home and there was a syncopal
episode while standing. The pt was in the kitchen, felt suddenly
light-headed, family helped him to a chair and he was
unresponsive, family called EMS. Though he quickly returned to
baseline.
.
At OSH, cardiac enzymes were elevated tnI 8.92 (0-0.30) CK 359
MB 48.9. ECG showed a-fib at [**Street Address(2) 71598**] depressions. He

received lopressor 5 mg IV x2, lasix 40IV x1, hep gtt was
started on transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath. At [**Hospital1 18**], his CK=325,
MBI=9.5, Trop-T=1.28. EKG showed sinus tach vs MAT, with Q
wave/ST elevation in [**Last Name (LF) 1105**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] dep in V5-6. After cath, he was
transferred to CCU for monitoring given his pulm edema prior to
cath. Prior to cath, he was on nitro gtt and received 200 mg of
Lasix in divided doses. Upon arrival to the CCU after the cath,
he was comfortable breathing at around 20/min and satting at
93%/RA w/ BP of around 110/60 and HR of 115.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

[**3-4**] Cardiac Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
significant disease. The LAD had 80% stenosis before the major
diagonal.
The LCX had no significant disease. The RCA was totally occluded
in the
mid vessel with left to right collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling
pressures were elevated (mean RA presure was 13mmHg and RVEDP
was
13mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressures were elevated measuring
40/25mmHg. The left sided filling pressures were elevated (mean
PCW
pressure was 25mmHg). The systemic arterial pressures were
within normal
range measuring 99/67mmHg. The cardiac index was depressed
measuring
1.8l/min/m2.
3. Successful PCI/stent to mid LAD with 3.0x18mm Driver stent
and mid
RCA with 2.5x18mm Microdriver stent and 3.0x18mm Driver stent
(distal/proximal) postdilated to 3.25mm. Further successful
PCI/stent to
distal RCA with 2.5x8mm Microdriver stent. Normal flow down LAD
and RCA
at end of procedure with no residual stenosis. Patient painfree
on
discharge from cathlab.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures. Depressed
cardiac
index.
3. Successful PCI to mid LAD with bare metal stent.
4. Successful PCI/stent to mid and distal RCA with bare metal
stents.

[**3-5**] CT Head
FINDINGS: No intracranial mass, hemorrhage, shift of normally
midline structures, or evidence for acute minor or major
vascular territorial infarct is apparent. Moderate subcortical
and periventricular white matter changes are consistent with
chronic small vessel infarction. Prominence of the caudate head
on the right is noted, which narrows the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
right ventricle. The visualized portions of the mastoid and
paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable. Surrounding osseous
structures are within normal limits.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
.
[**3-5**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). Left
ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the inferior wall, septum and
distal half of the anterior wall and apex. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle, but the apex is heavily
trabeculated. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is moderate to severe aortic
valve stenosis (AoVA 0.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary  artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial  effusion.
IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Moderate to severe
aortic valve
stenosis. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate
mitral
regurgitation.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2146**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings
indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical
decisions
regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical
and
echocardiographic data.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Rhythm: Patient was initially in MAT rhythm that subsequently
changed to atrial fibrillation.  Given history of syncopal
episode, this
