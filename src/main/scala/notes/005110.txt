1.  Porcine aortic valve replacement
2.  Pacemaker
3.  Status post resection for colon cancer in [**2143**]
4.  Status post right popliteal-dorsalis pedis bypass [**2153-3-1**]
5.  Incision and drainage of right foot with first and second
toe amputation, [**2153-2-19**]

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Flomax 0.4 mg by mouth once daily
2.  NPH insulin
3.  Biaxin
4.  Zinc
5.  Vitamin C
6.  Protonix 80 mg by mouth twice a day
7.  Lopressor 75 mg by mouth twice a day

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient does not smoke.  He does not
drink alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   The patient is awake, alert, in no
apparent distress.  His heart is regular rate and rhythm, S1,
S2.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His
abdomen is distended and tympanic.  It is nontender.  There
is no guarding.  His extremities are soft, nontender.  There
is a palpable pulse in his right popliteal-dorsalis pedis
graft.  His TMA site is well healed.  His suture lines are
clean, dry and intact.

LABORATORY DATA:   Of note, his admission creatinine was 2.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted from the Emergency
Room on [**2153-3-11**].  He underwent a CT scan, which revealed
dilated loops of small bowel with a transition point in the
distal ileum.  His KUB also showed dilated loops of small
bowel.  A nasogastric tube was placed, and the patient was
transferred to the floor for serial abdominal examinations.

As his abdomen remained distended, a repeat CT scan was
obtained on [**2153-3-14**], which revealed again transition point in
the distal ileum, however, his loops of small bowel were more
dilated, and there was some free fluid in the pelvis.
Contrast from the earlier scan had not passed any significant
distance.  Of note, the patient also became tachycardic at a
rate of about 117, refractory to intravenous Lopressor.  The
patient had a pacemaker.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] was consulted
from the Cardiology service.  The patient's pacemaker was
interrogated by Cardiology and, after two attempts, he was
back at a normal rate in the 70s to 80s.  It was decided that
the patient may have been in atrial fibrillation for several
months of new onset, and an echocardiogram was obtained on
[**2153-3-14**].  This revealed severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis as well as mitral regurgitation.  The patient was
started on a heparin drip for prophylaxis for his atrial
fibrillation.  However, as his nasogastric tube output became
bloody, this was stopped.

Considering the findings of the CT scan, it was decided to
take the patient to the operating room.  On [**2153-3-14**], the
patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy with lysis of
adhesions.  The patient was transferred from the
Post-Anesthesia Care Unit to the Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition, intubated, for further monitoring.  The
patient was extubated on postoperative day number one.  He
tolerated this well.  He had no issues while in the Intensive
Care Unit.

He was transferred to the floor in stable condition.  On the
floor, as his nasogastric tube output continued to be high,
he was started on total parenteral nutrition.  His
electrolytes were repleted.

On postoperative day number five, he had several bowel
movements, and it was decided to start to discontinue his
nasogastric tube and start him on sips of clears.  His oral
cardiac medications were restarted, including Lopressor 75 mg
by mouth twice a day.  He was also started on Vasotec 1.25 mg
once daily.  Several attempts were made to remove his Foley,
which were unsuccessful.

As the chest x-ray showed question of increasing congestive
heart failure, he was given intravenous Lopressor on several
occasions.  The patient was also started on a regimen for H.
pylori.  This included amoxicillin 1 gram by mouth twice a
day, clarithromycin 500 mg by mouth twice a day, as well as
his Protonix, which was decreased to 40 mg by mouth twice a
day.  The patient's diet was advanced without event and, on
[**2153-3-20**], the patient was discharged in stable condition to
rehabilitation on the following medications:
1.  Flomax 0.4 mg by mouth once daily
2.  Lopressor 75 mg by mouth twice a day
3.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth twice a day
4.  Amoxicillin 1 gram by mouth twice a day
5.  Clarithromycin 500 mg by mouth twice a day
6.  Vasotec 1.25 mg by mouth once daily
7.  Zinc
8.  Vitamin C

The patient was told to call Dr.[**Name (NI) 22019**] office for a
follow-up appointment, as well as to follow up with
Cardiology on an outpatient basis for further workup of his
atrial fibrillation.  It was decided that the patient could
not be placed on Coumadin given his recent gastrointestinal
bleed on his prior hospitalization, which required upper
endoscopy and BICAP electrocautery.
