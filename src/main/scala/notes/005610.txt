Allergies:
Lipitor / Lovastatin / Niaspan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, shortness of breath, hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
PA catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 84 yo man with h/o of DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, s/p
pacer for 3rd degree heart block, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
with EF of 50% who called his cardiologist this AM with CP and
SOB and was found to be hypotensive and in renal failure.  Of
note, patient underwent underwent a colonscopy the day PTA with
polypectomy x 2 at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].  Per reports for OSH he was
hypotensive with SBPs in the 70 prior to colonoscopy yesterday
and therefore it was done without sedation.  Per patient, his
SBP remained low after the procedure, but he was sent home.  At
2 am he awoke with CP described as a dull ache located over his
left shoulder and to his back associated with SOB.  Nothing made
the pain better, but putting a 3rd pillow under his head
improved his SOB. He was seen in his cardiologist's office today
where he was found to have SBP in the 70s, with JVD and crackles
on exam and was sent to the ED to evaluate for possible
cardiogenic shock.  By that time his CP and SOB had improved. In
the ED at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] he was found to be hypotensive with SBPs
70s-80s and in renal failure with creatinine of 3.7 from a
baseline of 1.3, with crackles on exam, BNP 2422 and mild
pulmonday edema on CXR.  He was seen by cardiology and echo done
which revealed EF 20%.  He was given 1.4 liters NS, was started
on peripheral levophed, and a triple lumen right femoral line
was placed. CE's revealed CK 27 and trop 0.016 in the setting of
a creatinine of 3.5.  Per report CXR revealed mild pulmonary
edema.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further management.

On arrival,  SBP 90s/50s on levophed, O2 sats 96 % on 2 L, HR
60.  He reports that he breathing feels better. Denies CP,
palpitations, abdominal pain, dizziness, lightheadedness.

On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools.  He has occasional BRB on the toilet paper.  He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope. He has stable 2 pillow orthopnea.  He does note
that over the past 2 months he has been more SOB when walking up
stairs when he does the laundry.  Denies associated CP.  He
reports that he goes to the [**Company 3596**] 3 times per weeks and lifts
weights and does some exercises, which he has continued to do.

11. GERD

Social History:

use quite in [**2152**]. drinks 2-3 glases of wine per night. No h/o
DTS or ETOH withdrawal. Last drink 2 nights ago. He is married.

Mother died at the age of 96 of "old age." Father had heart
problems in his 80s.  He has 2 sisters, who are alive and well.
He has 7 children, who are alive and well.

ADMISSION EKG: AV paced rhythm, rate 63, with no significant
change compared with prior.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2183-2-14**]:  The left atrium is
mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
hypokinesis and apical akinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Cardiac catheterization ([**2183-2-20**]): 1.  Coronary angiography in
this right-dominant system revealed minimal coronary artery
disease.
--the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the LAD had mild diffuse disease.
--the LCX had a 40% stenosis in its mid-portion.
--the RCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right- and left-sided
filling pressures, with RVEDP 8 mmHg and LVEDP 16 mmHg.
Borderline pulmonary arterial systolic pressures with PASP 26
mmHg.  Normal systemic arterial
systolic pressures with SBP 113 mmHg.  The cardiac output was
depressed
with CI 2 L/min/m2. 3.  There was no gradient across the aortic
valve upon pullback of the angled pigtail catheter from LV to
ascending aorta. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Nonischemic
cardiomyopathy.  EF 20%

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 41407**] presented with shortness of breath, chest pain and
acute on chronic renal failure. His exam, laboratory values
(including elevated BNP) and CXR were consistent with overt
volume overload. He was relatively hypotensive with signs of
end-organ underperfusion as evidenced by acute on chronic renal
failure. He had no ischemic EKG changes and negative cardiac
enzymes. TTE revealed newly depressed EF to 20%. The patient
required levophed for vasopressor support in the setting of
hypotension and poor perfusion. He was admitted to the CCU where
he had a PA catheter placed and underwent successful diuresis.
With symptomatic improvement, successful removal of pressor
support and return of renal function toward CKD baseline, the
patient underwent cardiac catheterization with appropriate
contrast nephropathy prophylaxis. Cath revealed no significant
CAD. His cardiac regimen was targeted to therapy of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy with severely depressed EF: He was initiated on
furosemide 20mg once daily, carvedilol 3.125mg twice daily,
aspirin 81mg once daily and digoxin 0.125mg once ever
