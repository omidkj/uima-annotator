SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
 66 yo F transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] for likely COPD exacerbation.
Reports 4 days of increased dyspnea, mild cough productive of a
small amount of yellow sputum (new for her), no fevers. She was
down to 10 mg of prednisone on a steroid taper and her PCP had
increased the dosage to 15 mg a couple of days ago [**3-4**] her
increased SOB. Denies CP, palp, N/V. No sick contacts. + chills.
No myalgias or HA. + back pain that started yesterday and is
constant. She has baseline low-back pain for which she takes
dilaudid and oxycodone. Currently cannot walk 3 feet without
getting SOB. + PND and gets paroxysmal SOB even when sitting. On
2L O2 at home and had been using nebs more frequently than
prescribed over the past day. Has been in and out of the
hospital frequently over the past year (including a stay at
[**Hospital3 **]) and usually receives her care at [**Hospital1 2025**]. She was
last hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2025**] through [**2-28**]. She was supposed to
be set up with BIPAP at home but this was never completed.
.
At [**Location (un) 620**], 90% on 2L - given solumedrol 125 mg IV, azithro 500
mg IV, nebs, CE neg and sent here as no beds. En route by report
high 90s on 2L.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, Vitals 99.2, 86, 130/67, 16, 98% on 2L. Became
sleepy in the ED with hypercarbia, likely [**3-4**] to breath so BIPAP was started and is now much more awake
and less tachypneic.


Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:
[**2152-3-16**] CXR:
1. Unusual appearance of right hilum as described, concerning
for potential [**Location (un) 21851**]. Contrast-enhanced chest CT is
suggested to better assess this region.
2. Emphysema, most severe at the lung bases, raising concern for
possible alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.

[**2152-3-16**] CTA Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. Small pericardial effusion.
3. Severe panlobular emphysema, markedly involving the lower
lobes. This raises the possibility of alpha-1 antitrypsin
deficiency in the appropriate clinical setting.
4. Atelectasis of the medial portion of the right middle lobe.
No definite obstructing mass is visualized by CT.
5. Bilateral lung nodules, for which six-month CT followup is
recommended.
6. Mild coronary artery calcifications.

[**2152-3-16**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF 80%). There is a moderate resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral
valve leaflets. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: small, hypertrophic, hyperdynamic left ventricle
with moderate resting outflow tact gradient

Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old female with severe COPD admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2152-3-16**]
for COPD exacerbation.  She was initially admitted to the MICU
and treated with BiPAP, steroids, nebs and azithromycin. CTA
negative for PE and TTE demonstrated hyperdynamic EF and
moderate LVOT obstruction.  She did well and was called out to
the floor where she continued a prednisone taper and standing
nebs. Her course was complicated by significant anxiety which
limited her compliance with  BiPAP and other therapies.
.
On [**2152-3-20**] the patient had a trigger for hypoxia (86% on 2L) and
ABG demonstrated 7.29/79/81.  She had refused BiPAP for the
previous 2 nights and had a temp to 102.  She was transferred
back to MICU and treated with antibiotics X 2 days.  She was
monitored in the MICU and used BiPAP nightly and continued on
prednisone taper (thought to be contributing to her anxiety) and
nebs.  The patient was taken off antibiotics (cefepime,cipro,
vanc) after a few days.  She was transferred back to the floor
and triggered for hypotension (64/25) on [**3-27**] which was
responsive to fluid.  She came off prednisone on [**2152-3-28**].  The
patient had been doing well from a COPD stand point over the
past several days, though continued to be noncompliant with
BiPAP at night.  The team was treated her anxiety with standing
klonopin with good effect, seroquel, buspar and escalating doses
of dilaudid and oxycodone for her back pain.  The day of
transfer the patient had a temp to 102.2 and complained of
nausea.  She had been constipated for several days but refused
bowel regimen.
.
She was transferred back to the MICU on [**2152-4-2**] after being found
to be somnolent on the floor. ABG 7.26/112/72/53. She was
started on BiPAP on the floor with some improvement in her
mental status and was transferred to the ICU for further
monitoring.  The patient also had a brief period of hypotension,
BP 78/D but improved with a small bolus to 110/70 prior to
transfer to the ICU. It was throught that her hypercarbia was a
combination of an underlying infection and increasing sedating
medications.  She was started on a 5 day course of levofloxacin,
as source of fever was not found (neg CXR, blood cultures, urine
culture).  She had an abdominal CT to evaluate for
intra-abdominal process, and this was negative for abscess, but
did demonstrate an abnormality in the bladder. (see below).  She
was managed with standing nebs and advair was restarted.  It was
not felt that she was having a new flare of her COPD, as she had
baseline
