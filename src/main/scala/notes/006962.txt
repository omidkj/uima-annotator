HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old male with
hypertension, cirrhosis, factor VII deficiency, history of
upper gastrointestinal bleed, recent prolonged admission for
diverticulitis, admitted on [**2101-8-4**], with anemia.  The
patient went to his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
on the day of admission for routine appointment at which time
he was found to have a hematocrit of 13.0.  The patient was
also complaining of lower extremity edema times two weeks as
well as some mild dyspnea on exertion with occasional low
grade fevers and worsening jaundice.  He denies nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, melena, bright red blood
per rectum.  In the Emergency Department, the patient
complained of a similar history complaining only of fatigue
and denying melena, bright red blood per rectum, hematemesis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  HIV diagnosed in [**2094**].  No HAART therapy.  CD4 442 on
[**2101-6-24**], with a viral load of 100,000 in [**2101-2-12**].
2.  Cirrhosis, ethanol induced.
3.  Diverticulosis complicated by diverticulitis, status post
sigmoid perforation.
4.  Factor VII deficiency.
5.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45
to 50%.
6.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed with a history of Barrett's
esophagus.
7.  Neuropathy.
8.  Depression.
9.  Anal human papilloma virus.
10. Ethanol abuse.

ALLERGIES:  Ceftriaxone (nausea), Combivir (rash).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Lasix 80 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Haldol and Remeron 7.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location **] by himself.  He
has VNA with physical therapy every week.  The patient
reports a tobacco history but denies current alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 101.4,
blood pressure 95/50, heart rate 110, respiratory rate 18,
oxygen saturation 100% in room air.  In general, a
chronically ill appearing, mildly jaundiced male in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat is normocephalic
and atraumatic.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Slightly
icteric.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  The oropharynx is clear.  Neck reveals no
lymphadenopathy,  Cardiac is regular rate and rhythm, II/VI
systolic murmur at the left sternal border.  Pulmonary is
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen showed
normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended,
guaiac negative.  Extremities 2 to 3+ edema at the knees
bilaterally.  Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII
are symmetric and intact bilaterally.  No asterixis noted.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
3.3, hematocrit 12.5 (28.7 [**6-14**]), platelet count 182,000.
Sodium 126, potassium 2.9, chloride 101, bicarbonate 16,
blood urea nitrogen 12, creatinine 0.8, glucose 97, ALT 9,
AST 47, LDH 192, alkaline phosphatase 294, total bilirubin
2.2, albumin 2.0.

Chest x-ray with no evidence of infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit service on [**2101-8-4**], for a low
hematocrit of 13.0.  An esophagogastroduodenoscopy shortly
after admission showed varices in the lower one third of the
esophagus with evidence of portal gastropathy, but there was
no evidence of active gastrointestinal bleeding.  The patient
was transfused four units of packed red blood cells in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit and had a bone marrow biopsy on
[**2101-8-5**].  The patient was transferred on [**2101-8-5**], to the
general medical floor.  His anemia was felt to be primarily
secondary to blood loss from a chronic lower gastrointestinal
bleed, however, he was also found to have low grade hemolysis
with an effective reticulocytosis.  His bone marrow biopsy
showed hypercellular marrow with normal iron stones and a
lymphoid predominance consistent with HIV.  There was no
evidence of opportunistic infection or malignancy.  The
patient had a colonoscopy which showed mucosal friability and
ulcers in the region of his previously known sigmoid colitis.
Given the friability of this area, no endoscopic intervention
could be undertaken.  The patient was started on HAART
regimen in hopes of stimulating his bone marrow.  He was
started on Stavudine, Lamivudine, and Keletra.  The patient
developed a Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
cellulitis at his intravenous site.  The intravenous site was
removed, however, the patient developed Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.  A transthoracic
echocardiogram and a transesophageal echocardiogram were both
negative and the patient completed a fourteen day course of
antibiotics.  The patient developed acute prerenal azotemia
during the course of his hospital stay which was felt to be
secondary to chronic anemia.  This was refractory to
intravenous fluids but did respond to a red blood cell
transfusion.  The patient will require close follow up
following discharge with monitoring of liver function tests,
electrolytes and complete blood count.  He will likely
require recurrent outpatient transfusion to maintain his
hematocrit and prevent recurrent renal insufficiency.  Prior
to discharge, the patient was treated with inhaled
Pentamidine for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
