Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old generally healthy lady who
experienced shortness of breath since returning from [**State 108**] 6
days prior to admission. She felt feverish but never checked her
temperture. She has also experienced chills. She did not have
cough, headache, focal neuro symtoms, chest pain, palpiations,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomitting,
dysuria or rash. She has not noticed any bleeding including not
experiencing any blood in stool or urine.
.
In the ED her vitals were Tmax 101.4 BP 123/63 HR 100 RR 30 86%
in RA with 99% on 4LNC. According to the ED resident's verbal
signout her oxygen sats improved to 99% on RA and was placed on
6L NC for comfort. Her CXR was suspicous for pneumonia and she
was given levofloxacin 750 mg IV once and combivent nebs. Her
hematocrit was found to be 14 and she received 1uPRBC and 1LNS.
She was trace guaic positive.
.
On arrival to MICU her vitals were T 99.6 HR 117 BP 161/59 RR 35
100% on NRB 100%.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2114-1-15**]**
   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2114-1-15**]):    NO GROWTH.

[**2114-1-14**] 5:38 pm URINE      Source: Catheter.
                            **FINAL REPORT [**2114-1-15**]**
   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2114-1-15**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other
L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may
vary.

Studies:
[**2114-1-13**] Chest x-ray - Retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left
hemidiaphragm is most likely atelectasis, however early
developing pneumonia not entirely excluded. Correlate
clinically.

[**2114-1-13**] EKG: NSR, vent rate 100s, nl axis, nl intervals, no
significant ST-T changes compared 11/[**2108**].

[**2114-1-13**] CTA Chest - IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral dense lower lobe pneumonias with small reactive
pleural effusions (consolidation is denser on the left, however
effusion is slightly larger on the right).
Additional scattered more ground-glass opacities as noted above,
which may
also be infectious or represent regions of alveolar edema in
this patient with mild interstitial septal thickening suggestive
of mild pulmonary edema.
2. Scattered small right middle lobe nodular densities measuring
up to 5 mm. In a patient at low risk for intrathoracic
malignancy, a dedicated followup CT should be obtained in one
year; if high risk, a dedicated followup can be obtained in 6 to
12 months.
3. No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
4. Cardiomegaly with prominent right atrium.

[**2114-1-15**] EKG - Technically difficult study. Sinus rhythm Late R
wave progression - probable normal variant. T wave
abnormalities. Since previous tracing of [**2114-1-13**], heart rate
slower, and T wave abnormalities
less.

[**2114-1-15**] TTECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
This constellation of findings suggests a primary pulmonary
process (e.g.., COPD, bronchospasm, pulmonary embolism, etc.)

[**2114-1-15**] Chest x-ray - IMPRESSION: Increasing right pleural
effusion. Essentially unchanged left lower lobe consolidation
and associated effusion. Empyema cannot be excluded on this
examination and if there is continued clinical concern for
empyema a dedicated chest CT with IV contrast is recommended.

[**2114-1-16**] Chest x-ray, lateral decubitus - IMPRESSION: Bilateral
small pleural effusions. Left side estimated to 1-200 mL. The
right-sided effusion is less than that matches the small amount
of pleural effusion demonstrated on chest CT performed on
[**2114-1-13**].


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old female who was admitted with
shortness of breath and fatigue and found to have pneumonia and
anemia.

# Pneumonia - In the ED the patient was ruled out for a PE with
a CTA given her Aa gradient.  CTA showed an impressive bilateral
pneumonia.  The patient was initially admitted to the MICU as
she was on a non-rebreather, but was weaned down to 3L NC
overnight.  She was transfered to the general medical floor the
following day.  She was continued on levofloxacin 750 mg for
community acquired pneumonia and continued to improve
clinically.  Urine Legionella antigen was negative.  She was
given nebulized albuterol and an ipratropium MDI for wheezing.
She also had an ECHO to evaluate for CHF given an elevated BNP
on admission.  Her ECHO was largely unremarkable except for an
elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, likely secondary to
pneumonia.  The patient had an episode of acute chest pain
during/immediately after the ECHO.  EKG was unremarkable.  Her
chest pain was most likely a result of movement and pleural
irritation from her pneumonia.  She was given morphine IV,
tylenol, and ibuprofen with resolution of her chest pain and no
further episodes.  As a result of this episode, consideration
was given to tapping her pleural effusions to rule out empyema
and AP and decubitus chest x-rays were perform
