History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 year old w/hx of MI at age 40 with subsequent
cabg 8 yrs ago, DM II on Prandin, CM with an EF of 20%, and
atrial ICD.  Sunday AM, the patient experienced DOE,
uncomfortable sensation in his chest and fatigue.  He presented
to his local fire station where rural residents can get VS
checks.  They found his HR to be 173 and took him to [**Location (un) 59322**] hospital where has was found to be in a wide complex
tachycardia @173.  They attempte rx w/adenosine x 2 with no
effect, followed by Lopressor and Cardizem, resulting in
hypotension.  He was shocked with 100 J to sinus rhythm, where
he has remained w/significant ventricular ectopy.  He was loaded
onIV amiodarone followed by Amiodarone 400mg TID.
.
Per OSH, BSP runs low 70-90??????s typically and is completely
asympomatic and has been getting his cardiac meds with those
pressures. Echo done yesterday revealed ef of 15-20%, dilated LV
w/multiple focal WMAs.  BGs @ OSH of 178, 293, 292.  ABG of
7.4/34/62 on RA.  He received mucomyst 1200 [**Hospital1 **] @ OSH.  His I/O
from OSH of 1840/1350 on day one and 1600/[**2076**] day two.  He had
elevated tropnonins (.15, .44, .43), nl TSH.
.
He is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for possible cardiac
catheterization, possible ugrade to [**Hospital1 **]-V pacer, possible
transplant evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
58M w/CAD, DMII, CM, ICD taken to Lakes [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital for
ventricular tachycardia where he underwent [**Hospital 69001**] transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
#Electrophysiology -- He remained out of VT from the time of
DCCV at Lakes [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital, though with significant
ventricular ectopy.  He was seen by the EP service who took him
to the lab for a VT-ablation, for which amiodarone was stopped.
The ablation of his RBBB superior axis VT, felt to be scar
mediated was sucessful, and the patient tolerated the procedure
well.  However, after his cardiac catheterization performed the
following day, looking for an additonal ischemic etiology for
his VT (as below), he developed atrial flutter, and so the EP
service brought him back to the lab for an a-flutter ablation.
During the ablation he developed an atrial tachycardia that
conveted into atrial fibrillation that could not be
pace-terminated, so he was cardioverted with 200 joules into a
sinus rhythm.  Dofetilide was loaded post-procedurally to
prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation.  Following this he
had an echo that confirmed [**Last Name (LF) 69002**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] it was felt he would
benefit from an upgrade to a biventricular ICD; to best
accomplish this, he was taken to the OR on [**2133-10-9**] for the
placement of an epicardial lead placement.  The procedure went
well and after one night's observation in the CSRU, he returned
to the cardiology service.  As his insurance would not cover the
medication, dofetilide was stopped.  For the remainder of the
admission he remained in a paced rhythm, with occasional sinus
rhythm.  Warfarin was initiated for his atrial fibrillation with
an initial heparin bridge.
.
#Coronary artery disease -- With multiple risk factors and prior
interventions, he was taken the cath lab for evaluation of his
coronaries.  He was found to have mild left main disease, a 70%
proximal LAD lesion filled distally by LIMA, 80% OM1 lesion,
totally occluded OM2, proximally occluded RCA with the PDA
filled by a jump graft from the LIMA.  RA pressure was 21, PCWP
33, cardiac index 1.4.  The cath team sucesfully ballooned the
OM1 lesion.  He remained chest pain free for the entire
admission.  He was continued on aspirin, carvedilol, and
pravastatin.
.
#Heart failure -- His cardiac function was quite depressed, as
the above echo and cath lab hemodynamics reveal.  For much of
the admission he appears volume overloaded with notable
peripheral edema.  He did not, however, have significant
pulmonary symptoms.  He was gradually diuresed with IV
furosemide with a good effect and was discharge on a standing
dose of this medication.  He had no major electorlyte problems
on this medication.  The biventricular ICD also was
re-established for help with maintaining ventricular synchrony.
In additon, he was discharged on carvedilol and told to both
weigh himself daily and adhere to a two gram sodium diet, about
which he was given considerable, detailed teaching.
.
#Type two diabetes -- His blood sugar was somewhat difficult to
control early in the hosptial course.  He was admitted on only
repaglinide,a nd his blood glucose was quite elevated on this
medication.  Whilst in the CSRU he was maintained on an insulin
drip.  On the floor, an insulin sliding scale was continued, yet
the patient was fairly adamant that he did not want to take
insulin as an outpatient.  As such, he was put on increasing
doses of oral hypoglycemics; by the time of discharge, his blood
sugars were well controlled on a regimen of repaglinide,
glyburide, and metformin.
