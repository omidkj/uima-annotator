Service:  MICU, GREEN
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is an 80-year-old with recent
complicated hospitalization on the Neurosurgical Service for
fall complicated by subdural hematoma who presented with
decreased mental status with apparent seizure activity.

male with history of diabetes, coronary artery disease,
pacemaker, transient ischemic attacks, status post prolonged
hospitalization at [**Hospital6 256**] from
[**9-19**] through [**10-27**] on the Neurosurgical/SICU
Service for falling down stairs resulting in facial trauma
and right moderate subdural hematoma.  His course was
complicated by prolonged intubation and failure to wean
and aspiration, initially followed by recurrent pneumonia,
atelectasis, left lower lobe collapse, congestive heart
failure, and fluid overload, and depressed mental status.  He
underwent tracheostomy on [**10-3**] complicated by tracheal
bleeding, pneumothorax, and asystolic arrest.  His course was
also complicated by recurrent atrial fibrillation well controlled
by Diltiazem, persistent guaiac positive stools, but GI declined
work-up, renal insufficiency with creatinine range from 2.1-2.9.
He was discharged to rehabilitation on [**2167-10-23**]. His
course at rehabilitation was notable for recent fevers with work-
up reportedly with gram-negative rods in urine and sputum.  He
was started on Ciprofloxacin and subsequently Ceftazidine.  He
was initially lethargic with thyroid studies showing increased
TSH of 76 and decreased T4 at 2.0.  He was begun on Synthroid
0.025 mg per day.  Also of note, Diltiazem was changed to Digoxin
for unclear reasons.

From a respiratory standpoint, he started to wean slowly and
most recently on pressure support or 15, PEEP of 5, FIO2 30%
breathing <30 BPM, and tidal volume of >5 cc/kg .  Reportedly ABG
seven days ago was pH of 7.41, pCO2 42, pO2 106.  He had been
receiving aggressive diuresis with Lasix 100 mg q.12 hours
which slowly increased his bicarb from 28 on transfer on
[**10-28**], to 234 on [**11-2**].  Apparently his mental
status improved somewhat.  On [**11-2**] he was alert and
responsive.  He was smiling and shaking hands with people.
OF NOTE HE WAS MADE DNR TODAY.

At 2 a.m. he was noted to have what appeared to be a tonic clonic
seizure.  He eyes rolled to the back of his head.  He turned red.
His body appeared rigid, and he appeared to have a upper
extremity greater than lower extremity, right greater than left
tonic clonic jerking movements.  Vitals signs with a blood
pressure of 132/49, heart rate 80, respirations 20, oxygen
saturation 100%.  This appeared to last about 15 min per the
nurse but 5 min per the respiratory therapist taking care of him.
Subsequently this all resolved except for continued right arm
shaking for about 10 min.  He received Ativan 1 mg IV push.
He was bagged and suctioned.  Temperature was 100.2??????.

Ten minutes after this, he was placed on vent settings for 10
min.  Subsequent ABG was with a pH of 7.59, pCO2 36, pO2 94.
He remained unresponsive and was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**].

On transfer he remained unresponsive.  Vitals signs were
100.2??????, 70s, 152/71, 100%.  Chest x-ray and head CT
unchanged.  Vent settings on transfer were SIMB 600 x 10,
FIO2 60%, pressure support 5 PEEP, ABG 7.49, pCO2 49, pO2 82.
Vent was changed to PAP 10/5, FIO2 30%.  Neurology was
consulted, and the patient was admitted to MICU.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  Not following commands.  He
seemed to direct eyes toward voice.  The patient was in no
acute distress.  Vital signs:  97.4??????, 140/62, heart rate 76,
respirations 20, oxygen saturation 90%.  HEENT:  There was a
1-2 cm laceration over the right parietal scalp, [**2-3**]
ulceration lesion on the left chin with granulation tissue,
exudate.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Oropharynx clear.  Dry mucous membranes.  Increased jugular
venous distention.  No lymphadenopathy.  Status post trach.
Trach site clean, dry and intact.  Lungs:  Coarse breath
sounds with rales.  Left lung base irregularly irregular.
Heart:  No murmurs, regurgitation.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel
sounds.  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Status post PEG tube
PEG site clean, dry and intact with no erythema.
Extremities:  There was 2+ edema in the extremities.  There
was a right PICC line in place.  Scattered petechia.  Eyes
opened spontaneously.  He directed eyes to voice but did not
follow commands.  Pupils reactive and equal but somewhat
sluggish.  Unable to test other cranial nerves.  Tone
increased throughout.  Withdraws to pain.  Moves all four
extremities.  Toes upgoing bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 143, potassium 3.6, chloride 100,
bicarb 34, BUN 109, creatinine 2.9, glucose 136; white count
10.1, hematocrit 28.8, glucose 230; calcium 8.2, magnesium
2.1, phosphate 2.5; INR 1.5; TSH 75.8; T1 927, T4 2.8 on
[**10-29**]; digoxin level pending; urinalysis greater than
50 white blood cells, no yeast, rare bacteria; urine culture,
blood culture, and sputum culture pending.

Chest x-ray showed infiltrate at left base consistent with
pneumonia vs atelectasis, small left pleural effusion,
right base atelectasis and distinct vascular margins which
could represent component of interstitial edema.

Head CT showed moderate size right subdural measuring 1.6 cm,
slightly increased from last CT.  No evidence of acute
hemorrhage.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is an 80-year-old male with a
history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, transient
ischemic attacks, recent prolonged hospitalization, for
subdural hematoma status post fall, complicated by failure to
wean, who presented with depressed mental status post seizure
at [**Hospital6 85**].

1.  Neurological:  He appeared to have had a seizure and was
postictal upon presentation.  Predisposition likely underlying
subdural hematoma and possible cerebrovascular disease.  Unclear
what might have precipitated this event overnight.  The patient
had a low-grade fever, recently diagnosed hypothyroidism begun on
Synthroid, which all may be potential contributors.  Head CT
showed no new bleed or midline shift.

Neurology recommended Fosphenytoin load of 1.2 mg IV with
subsequent 300 mg once a day 12 hours afterloading dose.
This was subsequently changed to Dilantin 300 mg once a day.

EEG was obtained with no evidence for active seizure
activity.

2.  Respiratory status: history of failure to wean, with
multifactorial etiology, initial massive nasal bleeding,
aspiration, recurrent pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and
fluid overload, pneumothorax requiring chest tube, s/p trach
placement, and intermittent atalectasis.

At this time, he appeared to have a left lower lobe
infiltrate.  Reportedly sputum was with gram-negative rods.  He
has been aggressively diuresed with Lasix with increasing bicarb
and metabolic alkalosis.

Sputum cultures at [**Hospital1 **] showed Pseudomonas and other gram
positive organisms, and urine culture showed Klebsiella.  The
patient was continued on Ceftazidine and Ciprofloxacin.
Ceftazidine dose was 1 g q.d. and Ciprofloxacin was 200 mg q.12
hours.  Infectious Disease was consulted and agreed with
antibiotic dosing.  Chest PT was continued and suctioning.

With regard to metabolic alkalosis and congestive heart
failure, the plan was to hold Lasix for now, replete
chloride.  With regard to ventilation, the patient was
oxygenating well with baseline FIO2 of 30%.  Recommended
changing back to baseline CPAP setting of 15 and 5.

Infectious disease:  The patient had a low-grade fever with
apparent pneumonia.  He was continued on Ceftazidine and
Ciprofloxacin.

Cardiovascular:  He had a history of rapid atrial
fibrillation.  Digoxin was held and levels were checked.
Diltiazem was changed to Digoxin.  The patient was also well
controlled on beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker.
Currently holding Aspirin anticoagulation given recent
subdural bleed.

Endocrine:  Diabetes was followed with fingerstick glucose
and placed on regular Insulin sliding scale.

Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on Levothyroxine
at 0.025 mg per day.

Chronic renal failure:  Likely
