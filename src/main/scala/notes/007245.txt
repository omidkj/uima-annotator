# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2187-12-28**] 11:33 AM
Evidence of fluid overload with malpositioned right-sided
hemodialysis catheter.

Brief Hospital Course:
71F vent-dependent, h/o ESRD on HD, h/o refractory C. diff
infection, admitted for HD catheter replacement.
.
# ESRD on HD of unclear etiology:  Upon admission, pt's tunneled
catheter was removed and then replaced with a 15.5 French
double-lumen hemodialysis catheter with 23 cm tip-to-cuff length
via the left internal jugular vein with the tip in the right
atrium.  Pt underwent hemodialysis on [**12-29**] with approximately
1.6L removed, and tolerated hemodialysis without a BP drop.
Calcium acetate was started TID with meals.
.
# Query line infection: Line site was found to be erythematous
and tender to palpation, mildly indurated, but without
purulence.  Blood cultures drawn [**12-28**] with no growth at time of
discharge.  Pt was started on vancomycin 1 gm IV per HD protocol
to cover skin flora in institutionalized pt, and discharge with
plan to continue vancomycin for a total 7 day course, ending
[**1-3**].
.
# Possible PNA: Pt had copious green secretions upon admission;
CXR revealed retrocardiac opacity and pneumonia could not be
excluded. Pt was broadly covered for nosocomial and nursing
home-acquired PNA with vancomycin as above, as well as
piperacillin-tazobactam for a total of a 7 day course.  Pt was
therefore discharged with plan to continue
piperacillin-tazobactam until [**1-3**].
.
# Diarrhea possibly [**3-9**] C.Diff: Pt had h/o refractory C. diff,
and had >10 episodes of diarrhea on day of admission.  WBC was
within normal limits and no abdominal tenderness was evident on
clinical exam.  C. diff A and B toxins were pending at time of
discharge.  She was continued on vancomycin 125 mg PO Q6H and
metronidazole 500 mg PO TID, with plan to continue both for one
week after discontinuing vancomycin IV and
piperacillin-tazobactam IV (end [**2188-1-12**]).
.
# Chronic vent-dependent respiratory failure, s/p trach:  Pt
continued on pressure support per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab regimen.
