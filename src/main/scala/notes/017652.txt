History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female discharged [**2152-11-28**] presenting to ED with
shortness of breath, chest congestion and hypoxia starting at
7:30 pm on [**2152-11-30**]. She was hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 97882**] for
altered mental status in the setting of a Proteus UTI and
hyponatremia. She was felt to be volume deplete and was volume
expanded.  The discharge summary notes difficulty with fluid
balance from presumed age-associated aortic-sclerosis or CHF.
The patient developed anasarca, but not thought to be
intravascularly volume overloaded.  The team uptitrated her
enalapril to improve afterload reduction in an attempt to
improve forward flow.  The patient also required escalation of
antibiotics from ciprofloxacin to vancomycin/meropenem before
she clinically improved (mental status and leukocytosis).  At
discharge, she was transitioned back to ciprofloxacin to
complete a 14 day course.

On the day of admission, she had acute onset shortness of breath
with desaturation to 83% on 2L NC, RR 40. She was given Lasix 40
mg po, Morphine 1 mg sq, and one duoneb. Following the neb, her
oxygenation improved to 90-91% on 4L NC, but proceeded to drop
to 70-80%. When EMS arrived she was satting 60% on 4L and they
placed her on a NRB with nasal trumpet airway.

Upon arrival in the ED, vitals were 100.2 102/70 80 26 92% NRB.
BP in ED 90-106/44-71.  Her lowest O2 was 86% on NRB, but she
mostly was 100%. She was given 40 mg IV Lasix with 200+ cc UOP
at 1 hour and improvement in her tachypnea to a RR of 24. She
was given a dose of levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia.  At
transfer, her vitals were 73 105/50 24 98% NRB.

Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was in distress. HR in 140s,
SBP 80, RR 40, O2 86% NRB. ECG with atrial fibrillation,
spontaneously converted into NSR and BP improved to 90s.
Nephew/HCP contact, does not want aggressive/invasive measures,
but wants attempt at stabilization.

Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension.
2. Arthritis, gout
3. Hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's) and thyroid nodule.
4. Waldenstrom's globulinemia.
5. Anemia, with a work-up at [**Hospital6 **] Center that
revealed a negative colonoscopy, and the patient was started on
iron sulfate three times a day
6. Thrombocytopenia
7. s/p fall [**5-2**], subdural hematoma
8. s/p [**2153**], colles fracture
9. s/p cataract surgery

Studies:
CXR: Findings compatible with moderate congestive heart failure
and bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis; however,
developing infection or aspiration cannot be completely
excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of HTN/Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia presenting with respiratory distress and
hypoxia now deceased due to respiratory failure secondary to
congestive heart failure and volume overload.

The patient was admitted with hypoxia from a nursing home.  She
had evidence of volume overload by CXR and a BNP > 70,000.  She
had a recent hospital admission for a UTI and was volume
resusitated during the stay and was volume overload on
discharge.  She has a history of heart failure so presentation
was consistent with an acute heart failure exacerbation.  Given
her recent hospitalization requiring broad spectrum antibiotics
for response she was treated with vancomycin and meropenem
initially.  She was DNR/DNI on admission and was placed on a
100% NR in the ED which was continued in the ICU.

The patient??????s respiratory status has continued to worsen over
the course of her admission.  She was continued on the
nonrebreather at 100% as her family did not want more invasive
measures taken.  As she continued to due poorly and did not
respond to lasix for gentle diuresis, further family discussion
in the afternoon resulted in the patient being changed to CMO.
Her antibiotics were stopped and a morphine drip was started for
comfort.

The patient was pronounced dead at 2120.  Her nephew (health
care proxy), Mr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 97857**]), was called and
informed of her death at 2135.  The ICU covering fellow, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], was called and informed of her death and the attending of
record, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was also informed.  As she had been admitted
less then 24 hours ago the medical examiner??????s office was called
and they waived the autopsy.  Mr [**Name13 (STitle) **] was asked if the family
wanted an autopsy which he declined.  Her cause of death was
reported as respiratory failure secondary to congestive heart
failure and volume overload.
