History of Present Illness:
58-year-old female with CAD s/p CABG, accelerated phase CML s/p
allo SCT [**2112-4-6**] complicated by upper and lower GI GVHD [**2112-4-25**]
and liver GVHD [**8-/2112**] presenting from OSH electively intubated
for hypoxic and hypercarbic failure in the setting of worsening
respiratory status. She was recently on prednisone 8mg daily and
developed sore throat and cough 09/[**2112**]. Steroid dose was
increased to 20mg with quick taper and she was started on
levofloxacin. Despite the levofloxacin and continuation of
atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis, she had increasing dyspnea and
presented to [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center on [**2113-8-29**].
.
Initially, concern was for cardiac cause for her dyspnea (she
has a history of CABG in [**2105**]). TTE showed normal EF. She
underwent cardiac catheterization that showed clean coronaries.
She desatted to 80s and was transferred to OSH ICU for bipap,
which was not helpful. CXR showed RLL consolidation and she was
started on vancomycin/zosyn/azithromycin ([**2113-9-5**] is day 5).
She has not had fevers or leukocytosis.
.
Additionally, she was found to have b/l LE DVTs (found when
accessing during cardiac cath). CT was negative for PE. She was
initially on heparin gtt but developed thrombocytopenia with
plts dropping from >100k on admission to 58k. IVC filter was
placed; she was started on bivalrudin and transitioned to
fondaparinux prior to transfer. HIT antibody returned negative.

.
Throughout her hospital course, she was becoming progressively
weaker. She had been ambulating independently on admission and
progressed to not being able to lift her legs with elevated CK
(790's on [**9-4**]), ESR, CRP. She then dessated to 70s on high
flow NC yesterday and was slow to recover her sats. Given her
hypoxia and overall progressive weakness, she was electively
intubated for concern for respiratory fatigue after discussion
with oncology here ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**]. Bronchoscopy was
performed after pt was intubated and revealed thick mucoid
secretions. Cultures sent. On transfer, vent settings were peep
5, fiO2 40%, TV 400.
.
CXR was not revealing for cause of acute respiratory failure,
though she does have retrocardiac consolidation on CXR from
[**9-4**], potentially related to atelectasis. She had low IgG and
received IVIG on [**9-2**]. Prednisone had initially been continued
at 20mg, but then uptitrated to prednisone 60mg (and converted
to solumedrol 40mg IV BID) after d/w heme-onc here for concern
of GVHD. In addition her cyclosporine was held as well. She has
been hemodynamically stable, though UOP noted to be dropping to
20cc/hr on ambulance ride over.
.
On the floor, she has no specific complaints. Denies CP.
.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- [**2102**]: Asymptomatic abnormal CBC noted by PCP during routine
visit
- [**2103-9-10**]: Bone marrow biopsy showed myeloproliferative
disorder, likely chronic myelogenous leukemia. Per patient
report, began taking interferon three times weekly shortly
after diagnosis.
- [**9-/2105**]: Started Gleevec 400 mg daily. At some point
thereafter, her dose was increased to 600 mg daily
- [**12/2107**]: Gleevec increased to 400 mg twice daily with
hydroxyurea and allopurinol
- [**2108-1-24**]: Seen at [**Hospital6 8865**], found to be

in late chronic phase CML. Stem cell transplant was
recommended, but she did not wish to pursue this course.
- [**9-/2111**]: Gleevec held due to worsening anemia and
thrombocytosis. Started on Nilotinib
- [**10/2111**]: Nilotinib held due to QTC prolongation, started on
Dasatinib
- [**2112-2-5**]: First seen at [**Hospital1 18**]. Bone marrow biopsy showed
accelerated phase CML. began induction chemo with 7+3.
- [**2112-3-29**]: Admission for MRD SCT
- [**2112-5-8**]: Discharged on day +32. Transplant complicated by
mucositis with biopsy of the esophagus suggesting upper GI GVHD

which was treated with steroids.
- [**2112-6-9**] colonoscopy showing lower GI GVHD
- [**2112-9-4**] readmitted with recurrent aGVHD of the liver upper
and
lower GI tract in the setting of reducing immunosuppression
.
