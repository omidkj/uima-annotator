Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
Right cerebellar hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2197-3-21**] Suboccipital crani for evacuation of the Right
cerebellar hemorrhage
[**2197-3-21**] Right frontal EVD placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 year old man with hypertension and vascular disease
transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with reported
cerebellar hemorrhage. He reportedly was brought to the OSH
after developing nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis at his
apartment complex. He arrived complaining of a [**10-25**] headache;
the nursing notes says he was awake and speaking and denied
CP/SOB on arrival. He was markedly hypertensive on arrival -- BP
was recorded initially as 232/132
(VS otherwise unremarkable). CBC and coags were normal (INR 0.9
and no known h/o A/C); BMP was pending. ECG remarkable for
obvious LVH (voltage criteria) and ?RBBB (RSR' in III), with
NSR. He was given Zofran and labetalol, and when his systolics
remained elevated in the 200s, he was started on a nitroprusside
drip. He was taken for NCHCT, which showed a 3cm Right
cerebellar hemorrhage. At some point during this initial
evaluation, he became acutely non-responsive, so he was
intubated (induced with etomodate and succinylcholine, also
fentanyl) and Med-Flighted here to [**Hospital1 18**]. He was continued on
the Nipride gtt en route, and paralyzed for transport using
rocuronium and propofol gtt.

He arrived here around 21:30 with BP 267/131, down to 168/96
with increased nitroprusside gtt rate. He was flaccid
(paralyzed). The ED resident informed me that someone had
commented on "asymmetric pupils" at some point, but the
[**Location (un) **] personell said that his pupils were 2mm and equal the
entire trip (they were this size of smaller, non-reactive, on my
arrival to the ED a few minutes after his arrival).


Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension
2. Renal artery stenosis
3. AAA endovascular repair c/b R ext iliac pseudoaneurysm, also
s/p repair [**2195**]
4. Peripheral vascular disease
5. Nephrolithiasis
6. Hyperlipidemia
7. COPD


Social History:
Lives alone, ex wife lives in U.S. but the rest of extended
family resides in [**Country 1684**]. He is primarily arabic speaking, but
understands some English. no tobacco.

Family History:
non-contributory

Physical Exam:
On admission:
Mental Status: Sedated / non-responsive. Does not blink or
track.
Later, as paralytic lifted, he grimaced inconsistently to
noxious
stimulation and spontaneously moved his Right shoulder and both
legs.

-Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equally small (1.5-2mm), round, and
non-reactive to light (?"pontine" pupils). No good view for
fundoscopy (small pupils). No doll's eye response initially.
Eyes
mid-position with no movement. Initially, no corneal response or
response to nasal tickle. Later, bilateral weak eyelash-blink
responses and legs moved to bilateral nasal tickle. Face was
symmetrically lax; when he later furrowed his brow to noxious
stimulation, it elevated symmetrically. Initially, no gag or
cough; later strong cough (tracheal suction) and weak gag
(gentle
ETT-wiggle). Initially, not over-breathing the vent and not
initiating full breaths on CPAP.

-Motor: Initially, flaccid x all extremities and axially. Later,
spontaneous minimal movements of RUE and bilatearl LEs.

At discharge:
awake, alert  to self, hospital, month. following all commands.
MAE with full strengths. incision well healed.

Pertinent Results:
Head CT [**2197-3-20**]:
FINDINGS: Centered within the right cerebellum, there is a 5.4 x
3 cm
hyperdense hemorrhage with surrounding edema (previously 2.8 x 3
cm); this
hemorrhage crosses the cerebellar vermis into the left
cerebellar hemisphere. Hyperdense blood is seen within the
fourth ventricle extending up into the third ventricle. The
lateral ventricles and third ventricle are dilated measuring up
to 4.4 cm. Hyperdense blood is seen layering within the
occipital horns bilaterally. There is no significant shift of
normally midline structures. The basal cisterns inferiorly are
obliterated. The posterior fossa is expanded with mass effect on
the brainstem. The cerebellar tonsils are at the level of the
foramen magnum. No acute fracture is seen. The visualized
portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well
aerated. Retained secretions are noted in the nasopharynx.

IMPRESSION: Large parenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right
cerebellar
hemisphere with intraventricular extension, mass effect, and
hydrocephalus as above, increased since 2 hours prior.

[**3-21**] Head CT
1. Interval occipital craniectomy with increased but residual
hyperdense
blood in the cerebellum and ventricles; evaluation of mass
effect is
suboptimal on this study due to portable technique.
2. Interval placement of a right frontal approach ventricular
catheter with
persistent hydrocephalus.

[**3-24**] CT head
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval significant decrease of the hydrocephalus with
normal size of the lateral ventricles and with the EVD in place.

2. Increase of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the both temporal and
occipital
lobes, likely due to redistribution of the intraventricular
hemorrhage.
3. Compared to the most recent prior study from [**2197-3-21**],
unchanged
amount of hemorrhage in the fourth ventricle and the cerebellar
hemispheres.

CT head [**2197-3-25**]
Overall stable examination without significant hydrocephalus in
the setting of external ventricular drain. Parenchymal
hemorrhage centered in the right cerebellum with extension into
the fourth ventricle and
biparietal/bitemporal subarachnoid hemorrhage, similar to 20
hours prior.

CT head [**2197-3-26**]
1. Interval removal of the right transfrontal ventriculostomy
catheter with hyperdensity along catheter tract, representing
minor parenchymal hemorrhage with trace intraventricular
extension.
2. Otherwise, the appearance is largely unchanged with
biparietal and
bitemporal subarachnoid blood, likely redistributional, related
to the right cerebellar hemispheric hemorrhage with fourth
ventricular extension, status post occipital craniectomy.

CT head [**2197-3-27**]
Unchanged right cerebellar hemorrhage with intraventricular
extension into the fourth ventricle. Unchanged biparietal and
bitemporal
subarachnoid blood. Unchanged minor parenchymal hemorrhage along
the prior
ventriculostomy catheter tract. Unchanged ventricle size. No
evidence of
vascular territorial infarction

LENIS [**2197-3-28**]  IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis
in the lower extremities.

CHest Xray [**3-31**]: PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates
unremarkable mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours. Lungs are
clear. Previously noted pulmonary edema has resolved. Small
bilateral pleural effusions noted. Left subclavian line tip is
terminating in the mid-to-distal superior vena cava. No
pneumothorax.

Lower Extremity Doppler Ultrasound [**2197-4-4**]:
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either right or left
lower extremity.

LENIS [**4-12**]:
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

NCHCT: [**4-13**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Increased prominence of the extra-axial CSF spaces,
particularly evident in the right posterior fossa and right
frontal region. This may be related to volume loss from surgery,
but the patient should be followed for intracranial hypotension
with clinical correlation. Indentation on the right cerebellar
hemisphere from the right posterior fossa extra-axial fluid
collection.
2. Expected evolution of intracranial hemorrhage with decreased
density of
right cerebellar hemispheric hemorrhage, and near complete
resolution of
subarachnoid and ventriculostomy catheter tract hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was taken to the OR emergently for suboccipital craniectomy
and evacuation of ICH. Prior to this procedure a R frontal EVD
was placed without difficulty. He did recieve 2 units of
platelets for his use of Plavix.  Post operatively he remained
