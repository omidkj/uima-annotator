Service: MED

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased shortness of breath and malaise

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catherization and stent in RCA, LMCA, and LAD

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 80 y/o M with a h/o metastatic poorly differentiated
squamous cell CA, GERD who presented to [**Hospital **] hospital with
2-3 days of increasing SOB and fatigue, saying he was "gasping"
for air by the time he got to the hospital.  Over the days prior
to admission, he complained of exacerbations of his "reflux"
that seemed to be worse with urination/defecation, not worse
with eating or supine position.  At [**Hospital1 **], had elevate CK,
MB, TnI and a CXR indicating possible pneumonia and mild CHF and
was started on B-blocker, nitro drip, ASA, lasix,
ceftazidime/azithromycin.  His OSH echo showed 35-40% EF,
septal/apical/inf wall hypokinesis, mild MR, trace TR.  A CT of
his torso showed mediastinal LAD, hilar LAD, B/L pleural
effusions, multiple pleural calcifications c/w prior asbestos
exposure, B/L LL infiltrates, RUL infiltrate, and a R inguinal
fluid collection.  A cath two days after admission showed 80%
left main disease, extensie three vessel disease, prompting a
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  At [**Hospital1 18**], pt had a cath with cypher and
hepacoat stenting of RCA, PTCA to LAD and LCx with hepacoat in
LAD and distal LM, hepacoat to ostium of LM.
Pt's post cath course was complicated by two episodes of fever
up to 101-102 with new diarrhea, RUL and RLL opacities.  Also,
pt has bilateral pleural effusions, L>R, s/p left thoracentesis
that does not support empyema, though with pleural fluid
appearing transudative in nature.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.)CAD -- Pt was admitted with three vessel disease and severe
left main disease.  Pt was considered to not be a surgical
canidate given functional status and metasatic squamous cell CA.
 A cath was performed on [**8-9**]: LM 60-80% ostial, 80% distal; LAD
99% ostial, o/w diffuse; LCx 50% ostial, 80% mid; RCA 80%
ostial, prox, & mid; Cypher & hepacoat x3 to mid RCA w/20%
residual; hepacoat x2 to LM/LAD w/no residual. Pt tolerated
procedure well.  He was started on routine post-cath
medications, including ASA, metoprolol, ACEI, statin, and
Plavix.  Once the patient was on the floor, he was noted to be
mildly hypotensive with systolics in the 80's (mentating well,
producing urine) with a Cr of 1.2, so his ACE-I was held, with
plans to restart as an outpatient.  His sbp responded quickly to
250cc of normal saline, coming up to 110-120, where it remained
for the rest of his stay.  Pt had no chest pain or SOB for the
rest of the admission, no abnormalities on telemetry, and was
considered stable for discharge.

2.)CHF -- Pt initially diuresed with lasix and ACEI started for
afterload reduction.  Pt had echo at OSH which showed EF of
35-40%.  However, given hypotension and Cr of 1.2, his ACE-I was
held, and he was kept 0.5-1.0 liters positive for two days with
no compromise of respiratory status, as it was felt he was
hypovolemic.  Following this, his fluids were kept even.  He had
bilateral pleural effusions that were tapped, and the analysis
was most consistent with a transudate, no empyema, no malignant
cells seen on cytologic exam.

3.)Azotemia -- His Cr bumped to 1.2 with a BUN of 29 and a FeNa
of 0.2%.  Given the clinical findings and lab values, he was
felt to be dry and the azotemia secondary to a prerenal
etiology.  His Cr trended down with fluids to 1.0.

4.)Fever -- Pt spiked a fever two days after cath.  Diagnostic
possibilities included pneumonia, infected pleural effusion, R.
groin abscess secondary to a metastatic nodal site, and
diarrhea/C difficile.  His blood and pleural fluid cultures were
negative, his pleural fluid analysis had a pH of 7.46 making
empyema unlikely, and his R. groin swelling had no pain,
erythema, or pus.  An ultrasound of the right groin showed a
fluid collection that could represent a hematoma or an abscess;
surgery evaluated the right groin lesion and felt that it was
unlikely to be infected.  His C. diff assay came back positive.
He was treated for the two most likely items on this
differential, the pneumonia and C. diff diarrhea, with
levofloxacin for the pneumonia and metronidazole for the
diarrhea.  By discharge, he'd been afebrile for greater than 48
hours.

5.)Squamous cell carcinoma -- Initially diagnosed [**2187-6-21**] by
excisional bx at [**Hospital **] hospital, CT torso at [**Hospital1 **]
showed necrotic mass in right groin.  Pt has had little work-up,
but wants to be followed at [**Hospital1 18**].  He was seen by Onc while an
inpatient and will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  A CT w/ constrast
showed bilateral pleural effusions with consolidation in the
right lower lobe, representing a pneumonia, an ill-defined
nodular lesion in the medial portion of the left upper lobe
measuring 2 cm in diameter, associated with extensive
mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, multiple ill-defined
patchy opacities with possible cavitations in left upper lobe,
with underlying bilateral pulmonary edema(these ill-defined
opacities can be a part of pneumonia, or pulmonary edema, or can
be septic emboli, or metastases), multiple calcified pleural
plaques suggesting asbesto exposure, and GB stones.  [**Hospital1 **]
will be contact[**Name (NI) **] to send over pathology slides and films.

6.)Anemia -- Lab results came back with low Fe and TIBC and
elevated ferritin, making chronic disease/inflammation anemia
the most likely possibility.  This is probably related to his
squamous cell carcinoma.
