History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4580**] is a 63 year old male with CM, EF 30%, CAD, prior MI
[**2155**],  h/o PAF 3 mo ago on sotalol, esophageal stricture s/p
dilation x 3 last procedure 3 years ago.  He initially presented
to an outside hospital [**9-17**] for chest increasing after a meal.
He was found to have an esophageal tear by CT.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for care on the thoracic surgery serivce.
This was treated conservatively with antibiotics.  Repeate CT
and barium swallow did not show definitive evidence of
esophageal tear; however, there was esophageal thickening
consistent with inflammation vs microtears that were thought to
be the source of his pain.  He has been managed conservatively
with NPO, IVF, and antibiotics.  In this context his home
medications, including sotalol, were stopped. Baseline EKG was
AV paced.
.
On [**9-19**], Mr. [**Known lastname 4580**] developed an episode of atrial fibrillation
with RVR to 150 and stable BP.  We received IV lopressor,
titrated up to 10 mg q4h without adequate control, and he was
eventually started on diltiazem gtt.  Approximately 10 hours
after it began, the atrial fibrillation spontaneously converted
to NSR.  Cardiology was consulted at that time and concludecd
that the atrial fibrillation was likely triggered by the absence
of sotalol with possible contribution from esophagitis
mechanically irritating left atrium.  Diltiazem was stopped, and
lopressor was reduced to 5 mg q4h to decrease catecholamine
tone.  Although cardiology recommended restarting sotalol as
soon as possible, he was unable to take POs for the next few
days and thus did not receive sotalol.
.
On [**9-22**], the patient's diet was advanced to clear and later full
liquids.  On the morning of [**9-23**], the decision was made that he
could take pills, so sotalol was started and lopressor stopped.
However, given that sotalol was scheduled to be given 8 am/8 pm,
he did not receive either [**Doctor Last Name 360**] all day.  Baseline HR in the
70s, a-sensed/v-paced, increased to 90s over the course of the
day.  He was up and about walking per hallway with nurse and off
telemetry in anticipation of possible discharge today.  Several
minutes after lying back to bed, pt experienced an episode of
ICD firing.  A pulse could not be detected, and a code blue was
called.  A monitor was attached showing wide-complex tachycardia
at a rate of 150-200.  Amiodarone 150 mg IV was given followed
by amiodarone gtt.  Analysis of 12-lead EKG demonstrated likely
atrial fibrillation with LBBB.  Amiodarone was stopped and he
received 5 mg IV lopressor.  He received a total of 7 ICD
shocks.  HR came down to 130s. A magnet was placed, and he was
transferred to the CCU.
.
On arrival to the CCU, pt complained of anxiety.  He denied
chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations. EP was consulted
and evaluated his device which confirmed that he had been
shocked 7 times today for what it recognized as VT (actually
atrial fibrillation with LBBB).  He is a-sensed/v-paced at rates
below 150 but conducts through his natural system at rates >150.
.
In the SICU, HR he received an additional 5 mg IV lopressor x 2
and 10 mg IV diltiazem with little effect on HR.  BP remained
stable 150s systolic.  A few minutes later he spontaneously
converted to NSR in the 90s.  Magnet was removed.
.
Over the course of the afternoon he became progressively more
obtunded/confused/agitated with increased work of breathing.
CXR showed evidence of mild volume overload as well as possible
RLL infiltrate.  He was given 20 mg IV lasix and levoquin/flagyl
started for possible aspiration PNA.  ABG 7.13/81/223. A trial
of nebs was attempted with the intention of starting BiPap if
needed, but patient's mental status decompensated further prior
to its initiation.  Anesthesia was paged stat, and the patient
was intubated with etomidate/succinylchole.  Propofol gtt was
started. CXR showed ET tube in place, improved volume overload.
.
In the ensuing hour, patient became hypotensive with SBP falling
to 70s.  He received fluid boluses, and arterial line was
attempted by multiple physicians without success.  Propofol was
weaned down and eventually stopped, but patient again became
extremely agitated despite repeated midazolam boluses and later
drip.  BP rose when propofol was stopped, but because of severe
agitation on midazolam and later fentanyl, propofol had to be
restarted.   For persistent hypotension, thought to be primarily
vasodilatory in origin secondary to medications, phenylephrine
was started through PICC with improvement in blood pressure to
~100. He briefly reverted into atrial fibrillation in the 160s
with stable SBP ~100.  Amiodarone 150 mg IV was given, and HR
improved to atrial fibrillation ~110 and several minutes later
into sinus tachycardia ~100. An IJ was placed for access. He was
subsequently hypotensive despite neosynephrine 1.5 mg, and
extremities were clammy.  Propofol was again stopped, and
fent/midaz started, with recurrent of severe agitation and
recovery of blood pressure. After considerable repitition of
this cycle, patient stabilized on fent/midaz without propofol or
phenylephrine.
.
At baseline, he is able to work in his yard, climb 2 flights of
stairs, limited by SOB (NYHA II). He denies any anginal type CP
on exertion. He gets CP when anxious, relieved by ativan.

Pertinent Results:
CT chest with contrast [**9-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Resolution of the inflammation in the lower esophagus with no

pathologically enlarged periesophageal lymph nodes, no
mediastinal free air,
esophageal thickening or localized collection.
2. Some improvement in the left lower lobe peribronchial
thickening,
nodularity consistent with resolving infection /inflammation.
Peribronchiolar
inflammation in the superior segment of the left lower lobe and
the right
lower lobe are unchanged.
3. The subpleural nodules in the left lower lobe are seen back
to [**6-13**] and
have not changed, however, followup in one year from [**Month (only) 116**] is
recommended.
4. Gallbladder stones.
.
Echo [**9-24**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
25-30 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**2-6**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen with atrial fibrillation and rapid
ventricular response. Trivial mitral regurgitation with sinus
rhythm. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
