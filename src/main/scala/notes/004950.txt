Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29226**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness, shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2134-1-23**] - Left radial A-line placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 77yo male with COPD, morbid opesity, OSA, DM2 who
has a recent diagnosis of Stage IIIB T2bN3Mx lung adenocarcinoma
(last dose of chemo on [**1-21**]) who presents with shortness of
breath, hypoxia, and hypotension.
.
The patient was in his usual state of health until yesterday
after chemotherapy.  He received his carboplatin and taxol and
went home where he developed watery diarrhea, weakness, and, per
his wife, some element of confusion.  He went to bed and awoke
this morning with increasing frequency of diarrhea, leg weakness
and an overall feeling of malaise with nausea.  Given this, EMS
was called and he was brought to the ED for further evaluation.
EMS found the patient to be hypoxic to the 70s on RA.
.
On arrival to the ED, inital vitals were T- 97.6, HR- 150, BP-
111/75, RR- 42, SaO2- 99% 15L Non-Rebreather.  He then became
hypotensive to the 70s so he was given IV fluids (2L NS total)
and started on phenylephrine gtt.  He denied chest pain,
abdominal pain, or leg pain.  Denies hematuria and was guaiac
negative.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia, S1Q3T3 (stable from EKG
in 1/[**2133**]).  Labs were notable for Cr 3.0 (baseline 1.3), BNP
[**Numeric Identifier 25298**], trop 1.59, D-dimer [**Numeric Identifier 43132**], and lactate 4.3.  CXR
demonstrated known RLL consolidation, mild pulmonary vascular
congestion and small right-sided pleural effusion.  CT head w/o
contrast did not demonstrate any acute process.  He was started
on vancomycin and cefepime in the ED.  Given elevated troponin
and concern for PE, he was started on a heparin gtt.  ECHO in
the ED did not demonstrate any new LV wall motion abnormality
but showed focal RV apical hypokinesis with preserved EF.  On
transfer, vital signs were HR- 108, RR- 25, SaO2 100% NRB, BP-
85/45 on neo 1.5mcg/kg/hr.
.
On arrival to the ICU, vital signs were HR- 104, BP- 110/63, RR-
25, SaO2- 99% on 5L NC.  The patient was without any acute
complaints.  He denies chest pain, dizziness, LH, syncope.
Reports some shortness of breath and diarrhea.

IMAGING STUDIES:
.
[**2134-1-22**] 2D-ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free
wall. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. The main pulmonary artery is dilated. There is
stenosis of the main pulmonary artery. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
[**2134-1-22**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - No evidence of mass or mass effect
in the brain, however, evaluation of the mass is limited due to
lack of IV contrast. Evidence of old ischemic injury in the
right frontal and left parietal lobes. Bilateral basal ganglia
lacunes.
.
[**2134-1-22**] VENOUS B/L LOWER EXTREMITY DUPLEX ?????? No evidence of DVT,
although neither left peroneal vein and only one right peroneal
vein were imaged. Note that DVT is found in only 5-15% of
patients with documented PE. Hence a negative DVT study in no
way excludes a PE in this patient.
