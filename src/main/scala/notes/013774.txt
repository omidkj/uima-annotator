Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2136-4-24**] - Cardiac catherization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 35682**] is a 77 year-old male with a history of CAD and
aortic stenosis who presents with dyspnea.

Had been in his usual state of health until approximately two
weeks ago when he began feeling dyspnea on exertion. Previously,
he was able to walk >100 feet and multiple flights of stairs
without any SOB. He began feeling quite dyspneic with 2 flights
of stairs. Also noted a cough, "gurgling" and SOB with lying
flat. No PND noted. He has no prior history of syncope.
Regarding chest pain/discomfort, he is vague.

Did not take his medications last night (he takes all his meds
at night and will forget to take every 2 weeks or so). He awoke
at 1am on the morning of admission to urinate. After lying back
down he felt extremely short of [**Name14 (STitle) 1440**] with the gurgling sound
in his throat. He had an extremely hard time catching his
[**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he called a cab to bring him to the ED.
In the ED, vitals showed HR 120, BP 205/117, RR 19, 85% on 2
liters. He was unable to speak in complete sentences given
dyspnea. Started NRB. SL nitro was given; 40mg IV lasix given;
additional nitro given; aspirin 325mg given. CPAP was started.
IV nitro was started but pressures dorpped to 50/palp and the
nitro was quickly shut off. Pressures remained over 100 systolic
thereafter with rates in the 90s. He was weaned to 5 liters NC
with sats in the 93-95% range and a RR of 18. 950cc of total UO
put out.
ROS: No fevers/chills/weight change. No palpatations,
nausea/vomiting, diarrhea/constipation. No weakness/numbness.

EKG ([**2136-4-23**]):
Sinus tachycardia with a rate of ~120bpm. Normal axis. IVCD and

CXR ([**2136-4-23**]):
Findings most consistent with pulmonary edema with superimposed
pneumonia difficult to exclude.

[**2136-4-24**] Cardiac Cath
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated only minimal coronary artery disease.  The left
main was
calcified in the distal portion of the vessel with a 30-40%
stenosis.
The left anterior descending artery demonstrated a widely patent
stent
in the proximal portion of the vessel with no other significant
disease.
A large ramus intermedius demonstrated a 50% ostial lesion.  The
left
circumflex demonstrated a 30-40% lesion at the origin of the
vessel.
The right coronary artery was a large diameter vessel with only
minimal
disease.
2.  Lv ventriculography was deferred.
3.  The aortic valve was not crossed after discussion with
surgeon.
Previous cardiac catheterizations and Echocardiograms
demonstrated
critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of approximately
0.7-0.8 cm2.
4.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated low right (RVEDP =
6 mm
Hg) and left (mean PCWP 10 mm Hg) heart filling pressures.  The
cardiac
index was preserved at 2.9 L/min/m2).

[**2136-4-25**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound
No significant ICA stenosis bilaterally

[**2136-4-24**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
0.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-9-2**],
the LV systolic function is now less vigorous, mitral
regurgitation is slightly more prominent and pulmonary arterial
systolic pressure is higher. The severity of aortic stenosis is
similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35683**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2136-4-24**] for further
management of pulmonary edema. He was diuresed and admitted to
the cardiac care unit. He underwent a cardiac catheterization
which revealed a patent LAD stent and a 50% ramus stenosis. An
echocardiogram was performed which showed severe aortic stenosis
as previously known with an aortic valve area of 0.7cm2. Given
the severity of his disease, the cardiac surgical service was
consulted. As a right middle lobe nodule was noted on chest
x-ray, the thoracic surgical service was consulted. It was
recommended that a CT scan be obtained and that he follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35684**] as an outpatient. On [**2136-4-27**] Mr. [**Known lastname 35683**] was
taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to one vessel and an aortic valve replacement
using a 23mm pericardial valve. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring. By postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 35683**] had awoke
neurologically intact and had been extubated. He was then
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. Mr.
[**Known lastname 35683**] was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. Mr. [**Known lastname 35683**] continued to
make steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative
day five. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist
and his primary care physician as an outpatient.
