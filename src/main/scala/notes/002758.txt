Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall, Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 74 y/o F with a h/o COPD on 4L O2 during day and
6L O2 at night, pulmonary hypertension, obesity hypoventilation,
dCHF (EF > 55% in [**8-/2205**]), anxiety and multiple recent
hospitalizations for dyspnea, thought to be due to her
underlying untreated OSA and obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
who presented from home s/p a "fall".  She was working with two
health aides when she felt weak and was lowered to the floor and
was unable to get up so EMS was called.  She initially
complained of two days of productive cough, worsening shortness
of breath and subjective fever/chills.

In the ED, initial vs were: 97, 70, 144/61, 14, 94% on her home
4L nasal cannula.  There was initial concern that she was
somewhat somnolent so she was given narcan 0.4mg x 1 with some
improvement in her MS.  She refused to undergo a head CT and the
ER physicians felt she understood the risk of her refusal.  She
had a CXR that was read as improved mild pulmonary vascular
congestion, no focal consolidation or infiltrate.  Her EKG was
A.flutter at 73, consistent with prior.  Labs were notable for a
PCO2 of 56, [**Known lastname **] count of 4.1, which is down from 6.1 two days
ago, lactate of 2.2.  Despite her negative CXR and normal [**Known lastname **]
count, there was concern for PNA so she was given cefepime,
levofloxacin, with plans to give vancomycin as well and admitted
to the ICU since she has baseline poor respiratory status.  At
the time of transfer her VS were: 88, 137/79, 24, 94% on 4LNC,
per report with no increased work of breathing.
.
On arrival to the MICU her initial VS were: 96.5, 86, 126/69,
22, 92% on 6LNC.  Her current weight is 257lbs and weight on
discharge was recorded to be 263.5lbs.  She complained of
shortness of breath that is unchanged from her baseline and
feeling tired. As there did not appear to be any acute process,
she was transferred to the floor.

Prior to transfer, she had a panic attack and on further
discussion notes that she has had progressive anxiety.
Pallitaive care had recommended morphine prn which was just
recently started.  The patient's anxiety worsens her breathing.
She is however, amenable to pulmonary rehab and further
treatment of her anxiety.

ROS: see hpi She denied any associated n/v/d, abdominal pain,
chest pain, palpitations, HA, changes in her vision.  She does
endorse continued orthopnea, PND multiple times per week and
possibly an increase in her LE edema.  She says that her cough
is the same as it has been since her recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**]
on [**2206-8-20**] with a presumed viral URI.   10 point ROS otherwise
negative.

Microbiology:
blood cultures ([**8-24**]):  [**1-14**] bottle coag neg staph
[**8-26**] cultures no growth.

Imaging:
CXR ([**8-24**]):  UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is continued
moderate cardiomegaly. Lung volumes remain low. The mediastinal
and hilar contours are stable. Mild pulmonary vascular
congestion persists, but may be mildly improved when compared to
the prior study. Linear atelectasis in the right lung base is
unchanged. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
identified. IMPRESSION: Persistent mild pulmonary vascular
congestion, perhaps slightly improved compared to the prior
study. No new focal consolidation.
.
CXR ([**8-25**]):  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-24**], there
is continued mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Poor definition
of the hemidiaphragms suggests possible small effusions and
atelectasis in a patient with low lung volumes.
.
Head CT [**8-25**]: FINDINGS: Again noted is encephalomalacia in the
left cerebellum (image 3:3)
and right occipital lobe (image 3:8), unchanged. There is no
acute
intracranial hemorrhage, edema or mass effect. There is no
evidence of
enhancing intraaxial or extraaxial lesions. The ventricles and
sulci remain
prominent, compatible with age-related global atrophy.

No lytic or sclerotic bone lesions suspicious for malignancy are
seen.
Thickening of the right maxillary sinus walls is again seen,
likely sequela of
prior chronic sinusitis.

IMPRESSION:

No evidence of new intracranial abnormalities. MRI would be more
sensitive
for evaluating the status of intracranial malignancy and for
detecting a
seizure source, if clinically warranted.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 74 y/o F with a complicated PMH that includes
chronic hypoxemia on home oxygen (4L during the day and 6L at
night), untreated OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
pulmonary hypertension and multiple recent admissions who
presents after an episode of weakness at home with anxiety and
shortness of breath
.
#Dyspnea
# Chronic hypoxemia
#Obstructive sleep apnea
#Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
#Pulmonary hypertension

It is unclear if this is a true change from her baseline, as
most of her complaints seem to be chronic and she has frequent
dyspneic attacks which are closely correlated with anxiety
attacks as well.   Her cough is unchanged from a recent
admission and she is afebrile, with no leukocytosis or CXR
findings that would support a pneumonia as the cause of her
dyspnea.  Her current weight is 257lbs, which is 6lbs less than
her recent discharge weight ([**8-20**]) which also makes a component
of HF and volume overload less likely.  No wheezing on exam.
Some notes indicate that she has COPD but pulmonary notes show
FEV1/FVC of 70% without significant obstruction.  She was
