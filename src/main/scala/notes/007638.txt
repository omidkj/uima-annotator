Other Studies
[**2132-8-15**] Portable AP CXR: Findings consistent with volume
overload, likely due to congestive failure. Repeat radiography
following appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for
underlying infection.

[**2132-8-18**] CXR: Resolving pulmonary edema. No definite
consolidation.

atherosclerotic disease, stable prominent mediastinal and b/l
hilar LN (unchanged since [**29**])

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a  73 y/o with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation
syndrome, CHF presents with SOB and somulence x 3 days
.
# Hypercarbic resp failure: CO2 of 105 on admit ABG, improved to
baseline of 80s with BIPAP. Was using home oxygen and bipap.
Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 65268**] of COPD exacerbation, but may be related to
BIPAP noncompliance.  She was initially treated in the MICU with
IV steroids for COPD exacerbation, then transitioned to PO
steroids.  She was treated also with a short course of
azithromycin.

She was transferred from the MICU to the floor on [**8-17**], but then
was transferred back to the MICU after becoming somnolent and
agitated, as well as hypoxic. She was again treated with bipap,
with improvement in her mental status.  She had a CTA negative
for PE and cxr consistent with improving volume overload.  She
was seen by the sleep service, who diagnosed obstructive sleep
apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  They recommended
initiation of BIPAP at a higher pressure, with ABG checks, and
allowing hypoxia to stimulate respiratory drive, so that goal O2
sat in the mid 80% range.  She will need a formal sleep study as
an outpatient to test different masks as well as different
pressure settings.   At discharge, her O2 sat was 87% on 2L, and
her most recent ABG showed a HCO3 of 71, ph 7.41.
.
She remains DNR/DNI.
.
# Acute diastolic CHF exacerbation: Her respiratory
decompensation appeared multifactorial, with admission CXR
appearing volume overloaded. She was diuresed on her home dose
of lasix, until she developed evidence of contraction alkalosis,
and then it was held.  She was discharged on her home dose of
lasix, with daily weights.

#  NSVT:  She had a single 9-beat run of NSVT in the ICU. Repeat
EKG and lytes NL.
.
#  DM2: While in the MICU the patient had elevated blood sugars.
She was managed with her glyburide and sliding scale insulin.
Her glyburide was increased at discharge to 10 mg po bid.

#  Hyperlipidemia: simvastatin
.
#  Acute encephalopathy: [**3-3**] hypercarbia exacerbated by
steroids. She was initially continued on her home regimen of
abilify, risperdal, and artane with haldol prn for extreme
agitation.  Ultram, rozerem, benadryl were held.  On her second
visit to the ICU, due to [**Month/Day (2) **] agitation, she was also seen
by psychiatry.  They recommended holding risperdal as needed for
acute agitation.  Her mental status improved to baseline with
improvement in her hypercarbia.  Her benadryl and ultram were
not restarted.
.
# FEN:  She underwent swallow evaluation, and failed.  She
appears to aspirate chronically.  Her daughter [**Name (NI) 65262**] (also HCP)
was aware but refused recs and instead compromised to soft,
thickened liquids.
.
# Code: DNR/DNI.
-has ICD in place, interrogated 1m ago.  Still active.
