CXR:
EXAM: Chest, single supine AP portable view.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: 84-year-old male with history of
hypotension.

COMPARISON: [**2128-5-20**].

FINDINGS: Single AP supine portable view of the chest was
obtained. There
are low lung volumes. There is elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm with
overlying atelectasis. Minimal left base atelectasis is also
seen. No
definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural
effusion or
pneumothorax. Dual-lumen left-sided [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] catheter is seen,
unchanged in
position, terminating in the right atrium. Vascular stent is
noted along the
brachiocephalic vein, unchanged. There is mild cardiomegaly. The
mediastinal
contours are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis and elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 year old male with history of ESRD on HD, CAD, a. fib, and
CVA with residual right-sided weakness presents from [**Year (4 digits) 2286**]
with hypotension.
.
# Hypotension- Reassuring that BP has normalized after one liter
of NS, and BP is normal now in ICU.  Differential broad.  Favor
hypovolemia, but must consider sepsis with indwelling HD line.
No other evidence of infection.   Bedside ultrasound in ED
without evidence of tamponade.  No VTE risk factors.  No
evidence of bleeding. Culture data remainded negative. Held
empiric antibiotic therapy, and patient remainded afebrile.  BP
in arm was [**Location (un) 1131**] SBP 60-70 at times, but as pt mentating well,
favor thigh pressures, which were [**Location (un) 1131**] SBP 110 throughout.
Beta blocker held, midodrine started upon discharge.
.
# ESRD on HD- M, W, F schedule, tolerated HD during stay.
.
# History of CAD- no evidence of active ischemia. Continued
statin, ASA. Held BB as above.
.
# Pulmonary Hypertension- noted on TTE in 2/[**2127**].  Has known
severe OSA, not on therapy.  No evidence of right heart failure
on exam.
.
# Physical deconditioning: patient declined physical thearpy
evaluation or home services during this stay.
