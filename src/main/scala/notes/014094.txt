RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2116-5-1**] 5:24 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: assess atelectasis

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
50 year old man s/p AVR with h/o Left atelectasis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess atelectasis
INDICATION: 50-year-old status post AVR with left-sided
atelectasis, please reassess.

PA AND LATERAL CHEST: Compared to AP upright chest of [**2116-4-29**].
Median sternotomy wire status post valve replacement. Prosthetic
AVR again identified. Mild linear right basilar atelectasis. The
atelectatic opacity at the left lung base has improved and
somewhat cleared compared to the prior study. The heart remains
moderately enlarged but there is no evidence of congestive heart
failure. The mid and upper lung zones are clear. The visualized
osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis, with improved aeration at the
left base.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was
passed with assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a
laryngoscope.
The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure. The patient
appears to be in sinus rhythm.

Conclusions:
PRE-CPB: The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo
contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus
is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No left
atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography).
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
severe
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is no asymmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. No left
ventricular aneurysm is seen. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. Right ventricular systolic function
is normal.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are focal
calcifications in the
aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve is
bicuspid. The
