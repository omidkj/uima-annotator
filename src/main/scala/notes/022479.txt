History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 30258**] is a 36 yo male with past medical history of asthma
and obesity who presented today to urgent care with polyuria and
polydipsia x 2 weeks. Approximately three weeks ago he had an
asthma attack, treated with prednisone x 5 days.  He noted
feeling sluggish and uncomfortable and discontinued the
medication.  He then noted increased thirst and frequent
urination over the next two weeks, with poor appetite and 20 lb
weight loss.  He drank mostly water during that time, with some
[**Location (un) 2452**] juice and milk.  Over the last week, his foreskin became
red, painful and swollen with white discharge.

Today, he had marked nausea and went to his PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 2274**] at the
insistence of his wife.  There, he was noted to have serum
glucose of 500, 4+ urinary ketones and bicarb of 20. He was
given 10U of regular insulin and 15U of NPH in office in
addition to 1L of NS and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS: 96.7 109 164/98 18 99%RA. Initial
finger stick was 363 at 11:20pm. He was given 8 units of regular
insulin IV and started on insulin drip at 10 units per hour. He
also received 40mEq potassium chloride. ECG, CXR, UA
unremarkable. Repeat finger stick 299. VS prior to transfer:
98.4 129/73 92 16 97%RA. Repeat labs revealed persistent anion
gap of 20.

On the floor, FSBG was 160 and D5 1/2NS was started along with
insulin drip. Currently, he complains of fatigue, dry mouth, and
mild nausea.  He denies fever, chills, dysuria/urgency, flank

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 30258**] is a 36 yo male with past medical history of asthma
and obesity who presented with polyuria and polydipsia x 2
weeks.

# Diabetes/DKA.  This is the initialy diagnosis of diabetes for
this patient.  The grossly elevated blood glucose is likely
worsened by recent use of prednisone for asthma exacerbation and
possible mild URI (nasal congestion).  Initial serum glucose
(500s), + urine and blood ketones.  Normal WBC, CXR, EKG with
negative troponin.  On admission, he was on D5 ?????? NS to avoid
cerebral edema [**1-29**] rapid drop of glucose < 250 with insulin,
insulin gtt, and electrolyte repletion.  His anion gap closed on
[**2182-10-25**] and was transitioned to NPH 15 units [**Hospital1 **] and ISS with
oral intake [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations.  Hgb A1C is found to be
13.3 suggesting on-going hyperglycemia for a period of time.  He
remained hyperglycemic on [**2182-10-26**] but with ISS adjusted.
Patient was educated on use of glucometer and insulin self
administration. He was started on diabetic diet and was
encouraged to increase his physical activities for weight loss.
  He was discharged with Insulin NPH 20 u QAM and 20 u QHS,
accompanied with an insulin sliding scale.  He will contact his
primary care doctor or the [**Last Name (un) **] for follow up control of his
diabetes.

# Balanitis.  Possibly occurred in the setting of recent steroid
use and underlying diabetes/hyperglycemia.  Improved with
clotrimazole [**Hospital1 **] (D1 [**2182-10-25**]) for a total of 7 day course.
Plan is to continue observation with clotrimazole and hygiene.
If persistent symptoms, will plan to culture the discharge, UA,
Uc, and KOH for miscroscopy for urethritis

#Asthma.  Chronic and stable since last exacerbation.  Continue
Singulair 10 mg qHS and prn albuterol inhaler.

#Acute Renal Failure.  Likely pre-renal from dehydration/DKA.
Resolved, although unclear what the baseline is.  Creatinine
improving 1.6->1.0 with rehydration.

#Potassium Depletion.  He received potassium repletion during
DKA with close monitoring of his other electrolytes.

# Hyponatremia.  When corrected sodium with glucose, patient
actually has normal sodium level.  Will continue to monitor.

#. FEN: diabetic diet, replete electrolytes as necessary, hold
off on IVF for now as glucose improves
#. Prophylaxis: bowel regimen, physical activity
#. Communication: Patient & wife
#. Code: Full (discussed with patient)
