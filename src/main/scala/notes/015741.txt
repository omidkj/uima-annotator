leaflets are moderately thickened. The posterior leaflet is very
degenerate and there is moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation. There is moderate MAC. There is no pericardial
effusion. The tip of the SGC is seen at the PA bifurcation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1007**] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up prior to admission. On [**1-10**] she was
brought directly to the operating room where she underwent a
mitral valve repair and coronary artery bypass graft x 1. Please
see operative report for surgical details. Following surgery she
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Beta-blockers and diuretics
were started and she was gently diuresed towards her pre-op
weight. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per
protocol. On post-op day two she was transferred to the
step-down unit for further care.  Her beta blockers were
titrated for better blood pressure and heart rate control. She
was experiencing nausea while taking Dilaudid and this resolved
with changing to Tylenol and Ultram for pain control.  On post
operative day 5 she was tolerating a full oral diet, her
incisions were healing well and she was ambulating in the halls
without difficulty.  It was felt that she was safe for discharge
home at this time with VNA services.  All appopriate follow up
appointments were arranged.
