Chief Complaint:
N/V/D

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old man with h/o CAD, dilated
ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 10%), aflutter on Dabigatran, BiV
ICD, DM, HTN, HLD, CKD, R 4th toe amputation with debridement in
[**2112-6-3**], s/p 6 weeks of Vanc/Ctx for osteomyelitis, who
presents with N/V/D x4 days.

Patient has been having nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the
past 4 days. Diarrhea is watery stool, nonbloody. No recent
travel or sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] abdominal pain. +subjective fevers
and chills. Of note, patient finished 6 week course of Vanc/Ctx
for R foot osteomyelitis on [**2112-9-11**].

In the ED, initial VS were stable. Patient was given Dilaudid
for chronic LE pain, 250cc NS, and Zofran. RUQ U/S with sludge,
negative [**Doctor Last Name 515**], no wall edema. Labs notable for lactate 2.7,
anion gap 19, Cr 2.2, HCO3 9. pH was 7.21 on VBG. Patient has
been relatively hypotensive, SBP 90s. On the Medicine floor, the
patient was treated with IVF boluses (1.5L) and started on
broad-spectrum antibiotics for concern for sepsis. Patient was
altered in the AM, but became more alert in the afternoon. He
was refusing VS and lab draws at times. Lactate and anion gap
improved initially, but then worsened in the early evening.
Given concern for worsening labs, patient was transferred to the
ICU for closer monitoring.

In the ICU, the patient is currently not complaining of nausea,
vomiting, or abdominal pain. He has had no episodes of diarrhea
today. He is c/o L knee pain, new from a few weeks ago.

[**2112-10-10**] UCx: negative

STUDIES:
[**2112-10-10**] ECHO:
Left ventricular hypertrophy with cavity dilatation and severe
global biventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process
(multivessel CAD, toxin, metabolic, etc.) Severe pulmlonary
artery hypertension. Tricuspid regurgitation. Mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-12-1**],
global and regional left ventricular systolic function is now
more depressed. The severity of tricuspid regurgitation is
slightly increased.

[**2112-10-10**] RUQ U/S:
1. Nondistended gallbladder filled with sludge, negative
son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign, and minimal gallbladder wall edema
and pericholecystic fluid. Findings likely due to chronic liver
disease.
2. Mild perihepatic ascites and small left pleural effusion.
3. Normal common bile duct diameter measuring 3 mm.
4. Homogeneous echogenicity of the liver without focal lesion.

[**2112-10-11**] L Knee XR:
1. Incompletely seen intramedullary rod with distal interlocking
screw, with ossification surrounding the head of the screw and
distal lateral femur. No signs of orthopedic hardware loosening.

2. No definite acute fracture or dislocation.
3. Extensive vascular calcified atherosclerotic disease at the
left knee soft tissues.
4. Trace knee joint effusion

[**2112-10-12**] CXR:
Left pectoral CCD with defibrillator leads leading to the right
ventricle and other two leads each terminating into the right
atrium and left ventricle are unchanged in position. Patient is
status post median sternotomy and has intact sternal sutures.
Moderate-to-large cardiomegaly and mediastinal and hilar
contours are stable. Bilateral lung volumes remain low with mild
improvement in the pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion. No
discrete opacities concerning for pneumonia.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old man with h/o CAD, sCHF (EF <20%),
DM, HTN, CKD, s/p R 4th toe amputation and recent Abx, who was
admitted with N/V/D x 4days. He was transferred from the medical
floor to the ICU for sepsis, found to have MRSA bacteremia.
Likely source is from his R foot, where he recently had a toe
amputation and osteomyelitis. Despite treatment with
broad-spectrum antibiot
