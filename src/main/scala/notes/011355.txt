IMAGING:
CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extensive
multifocal
opacities have substantially decreased. However, a right upper
lobe opacity with air bronchograms is still clearly visible and
likely to correspond to pneumonia. No evidence of pleural
effusions. No pulmonary edema. Borderline size of the cardiac
silhouette.


Brief Hospital Course:
28 y/o M with h/o psychiatric d/os and substance abuse who
presents after being found somnolent on the street likely due to
Seroquel overdose. Now with new fever concerning for PNA vs.
early EtOH withdrawal.

# Drug overdose: The patient was found slumped over a car and
was somnolent on arrival to the ED. He endorsed using large
amounts of Seroquel, EtOH, and Xanax. Urine tox was (-); patient
reports his last drink being >1 day prior. Recieved naloxone in
the ED with minimal response.  Admitted to ICU for close
monitoring of resp status given long Seroquel wash-out period.
EKG unremarkable, no QTc prolongation.  Pt was alert by the time
he reached [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] floor, where he became agitated and verbally
abusive.  Pt became more calm with ativan and pain medication
(has h/o chronic pain and drug abuse, so concern was for
withdrawal).  He was monitored on CIWA but did not score.  His
respiratory status was stable throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay so he was
transferred to the floor where he did not show any signs of
continued withdrawl and was given 0.5 mg PO ativan PRN for
aggiation.  Patient was not discharged on any anxiolytic
medicaitons.
.
# Fever: While being obs'ed in the ED, the patient developed a
fever to 102.4. A CXR showed a RML consolidation which was new
since a prior film in [**11/2117**], though lung volumes were
decreased. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures were obtained.  Pt
was started on vanc/azithro/CTX for empiric treatment of CAP.
Pt was placed on CIWA for possible EtOH withdrawal but did not
score.  Vanc was given in ED but discontinued on the floor
because there was no indication for MRSA coverage.  Repeat CXR
confirmed likely presence of PNA but in RUL.  Pt was doing well
so was continued on azithro/CTX and was transferred to the
floor.  Sputum cultures grew pan-sensitive S. aureus and the
patient was treated with IV vancomycin while inpaitent and
discharged to complete a 14 day course of PO clindamycin 600 mg
Q8H.
.
# EtOH abuse: pt has a h/o EtOH abuse. Reports last drink was
Thursday. Recently detoxed at MasAC making withdrawal at this
time less likely.   Kept on CIWA in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] but did not score.
Given MVI, folate, thiamine.  SW was consulted as well as psych.
 Pt expressed desire to be treated by inpatient psych facility
once medically stable.  Patient will follow up with pshyciatric
providers and an appointment was made for him at [**Location 61127**]Multi-Service Agency - [**Location (un) 3146**] Counseling Center -
Day Treatment for [**Location (un) **] [**10-24**] at 4 pm.

# Asthma: gave albuterol and ipratropium nebs as well as
montelukast.  Stopped salmeterol because pt was not on a
steroid, which should be combined with [**Last Name (un) **] to reduce
cardiovascular side effects.  Would recommend fluticasone or
advair as a replacement, to be outpatient PCP.

# Chronic pain: patient c/o chronic pain in right foot, neck,
and umbilical hernia site.  Had prior surgery on right foot for
unknown reason. Held home gabapentin given somnolence.  Added
tylenol for pain and oxycodone 15mg po q6h prn, which pt said
worked well in managing pain.  Patient was discharged on 750 mg
Robaxin Q6H PRN for pain per psychiatry, patient was not
discharged with any opiates.

# Psych (Bipolar D/o, depression): Continued Clozaril and
cymbalta at home dosing.  Psych consulted.  Pt reports having
psych meds discontinued in detox facility, which he did not
like.  Pt expressed desire to be treated by inpatient psych
facility once medically stable.  Psych agreed to make
arrangements for this once pt was medically cleared.  Psych
rec'd restarting seroquel at 100mg po q6h prn while in house,
but declined to send patient on out on standing antipsychotics
given his abuse history and need to establish long term
pshyciatric care.  Patient will follow up with pshyc
