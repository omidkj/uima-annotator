Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line insertion in ED

History of Present Illness:
62yo M h/o chronic gastric outlet obstruction [**3-10**] pancreatic CA
p/w 6-8 weeks LUQ abd pain and worsening nausea, decreased PO
intake and vomiting. Today the pt presented to CyberKnife Center
for 1 of 3 planned fractions to pancreas. A CT abdomen revealed
a gastric outlet obstruction. The pt was tachyc and an O2 Sat
was 77% on RA, placed on 4LO2NC with improvement to 96% and HR
returned to low 90's. Pt reports decreased po intake over the
last couple of days and increased nausea. He reports [**8-16**] pain
to his left mid-abdomen which radiates through to his back and
up to his left shoulder and across to his right shoulder. The pt
was subsequently sent to the E.D.
.
In the ED, his vitals were 98.4 75 133/69 rr 16 98%, the pt
received 2L NS, Zofran 4mg, Morphine 2mg, Combivent Nebs,
Solumedrol 125mg, Cefepime 2gm, Protonix 40mg. A central line
was placed following a hypotensive episode to the 70s and the pt
was started on levophed 0.06mcg. CVP was ~7. CXR revealed a
large gastric bubble and an NGT was placed revealing coffee
ground emesis. Labs revealed a 4 point Hct Drop. EKG showed new
biphasic TWs V1-2 although CEs 1st set neg. A CT Torso was
performed to r/o PE, dissection, infection. The pt received
Unasyn.
.
The pt was seen by both ERCP and Surgery that suggested the pt
be kept NPO overnight, with transfer to the MICU for likely
duodenal stenting in the AM for gastric outlet obstruction.
.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary
frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness,
focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

[**2114-12-19**] CT Torso:
IMPRESSION:

1. Scattered ground-glass opacities within the lungs (new since
[**2114-11-8**]) for which the differential is broad. Differential
diagnosis includes drug toxicity from chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name 360**],
infectious process (consider PCP in the neutropenic patient),
atypical edema, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Aspiration and
lymphangitic tumor spread are not favored diagnoses. Clinical
correlation is advised to narrow this differential.
2. New mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy since [**2114-11-7**].

3. Gastric outlet obstruction likely secondary to known tumor
encasement at the level of the second portion of the duodenum.
4. Debris within the metallic common bile duct stent which was
previously
air-filled without evidence of intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation.
5. New hypoattenuating lesion at the dome of the liver (series
3: image 72), which is not fully characterized on this arterial
phase study.
6. Renal calculi within the left kidney as described above.
Possible mild
obstruction. Recommend correlation with ultrasound if there are
corresponding symptoms.
7. Coronary artery calcifications, status post coronary artery
bypass
grafting.
8. Increased size and new pulmonary nodules within the right
middle lobe for which monitoring on followup exams is
recommended.

[**2114-12-21**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis and focal akinesis
of the distal half of the inferior wall and mid inferolateral
wall (LVEF = 40 %). Right ventricular chamber size is normal
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild global
and mild regional systolic dysfunction.

[**2114-12-22**] Portable Abd U/S: FINDINGS: The bowel gas pattern is
essentially within normal limits with no evidence of
obstruction. No free Intraperitoneal gas, though this could be
difficult to detect on the left decubitus view presented.
If there is strong clinical suspicion for either obstruction or
free
intraperitoneal gas, CT would be the next imaging study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26670**] is a 62yo M w/ h/o chronic gastric outlet
obstruction [**3-10**] pancreatic CA now presenting with Acute
Respiratory Distress and hypotension.
.
# Acute Respiratory Distress: The pt arrived in the ICU now on
6L NC from a baseline of no O2 in the setting of new ground
glass opacities. DDx included infection (Aspiration PNA,
Atypical), inflamatory rxn (potentially secondary to
chemotherapy- Gemzar), edema, hemorrhage.  He was initially put
on Vanco, cefepime and doxycycline for coverage of aspiration
and atypical PNA given his h/o allergy to Cipro and Macrolides.
He was given nebs PRN. He was diuresed on [**12-22**] without
significant improvement in respiratory status.  He respiratory
status continued to deteriorate during his ICU course despite
these treatments and his O2 sat gradually trended down to the
high 80's on 6LNC. Given his metastatic disease, he and his
family did not feel intubation was appropriate. Unfortunately,
he was also not stable enough for transport home to [**State 1727**] where
he and his family had thought he might like to be hospice. He
was made CMO in the am on [**2114-12-23**]. He was surrounded my his
family during that day while on Dilaudid gtt with ativan PRN and
oxygen mask. He died early in the morning of [**2114-12-24**]. His
family was staying nearby and was notified as was his oncologist
in [**State 1727**].
.
# Hypotension: Pt was briefly placed on Levophed in the ED for
hypotension which quickly resolved on arrival to the ICU and was
discontinued. Blood pressure was supported with IVF boluses PRN.

.
# Gastric Outlet Obstruction: The pt had originally come to
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-19**] to be evaluated for cyberknife treatment but was
transferred to the ED with low O2 Sat. Cyberknife team was
contact[**Name (NI) **] during his ICU stay but did not feel he was stable
enough for treatment and was not
