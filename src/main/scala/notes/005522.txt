Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known firstname 9198**] [**Known lastname **] is a
59-year-old female with a past medical history for a thyroid
cyst that was removed approximately 40 years ago, status post
dilatation and curettage for abnormal uterine bleeding, and
osteoarthritis of the right knee who  noted increased
frequency of chest discomfort over the last several weeks.
This was not exertional in nature and was not precipitated by
any one activity.

Sh[**Last Name (STitle) 37242**]had a chronic history of osteoarthritis of the right
knee and was scheduled for right knee replacement surgery,
and during her preoperative workup she had a chest x-ray on
[**2197-10-10**] that was read as a possible dilated or
tortuous versus aneurysmal thoracic aorta. As a consequence
from this workup, and given her symptoms of chest discomfort
and pain, she was evaluated by chest computed tomography
which showed a thoracic aortic aneurysm measuring 5.5 cm
maximally at the root, 4 cm at the arch, and approximately
3 cm at the level of the diaphragm.  Due to this, her knee
surgery was clearly and obviously postponed, and she was
referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for operative management of her
thoracic aortic aneurysm.

Preoperative cardiac catheterization showed a right-dominant
circulation and normal coronaries.  No evidence of
significant stenoses, and an ejection fraction of 60%.  This
catheterization was performed on [**2197-11-23**] on her
date of admission to the hospital.  She had preoperative
laboratories significant for a hematocrit of 38, and a blood
urea nitrogen and creatinine of 14 and 0.6, and normal
coagulation profile.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   As stated.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She has no significant alcohol or tobacco
history.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram on admission just
showed borderline left ventricular hypertrophy, sinus rhythm
in the 60s.  No ST segment changes.


HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:   On [**2197-11-24**], she went to the
operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] where she underwent a
Bentall procedure which was aortic root repair with hemograph
as well as an aortic valve replacement with a #21 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
mechanical valve.  This was done under general endotracheal
anesthesia with cardiopulmonary bypass.  She tolerated the
procedure well, and her pericardium was subsequently left
open.  She had a right radial arterial line, and the right
internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter for hemodynamic
monitoring.  Two ventricular and one atrial pacing wire were
present as well as two mediastinal and one left pleural tube.
Her mean arterial pressure coming off the bypass was 69 with
a central venous pressure of 23, pulmonary artery diastolic
pressure of 23, with a mean of 31.  Her rate was 80 in normal
sinus.  She was on Neo-Synephrine for pressure control,
aprotinin for anticoagulation given homograft, as well as
propofol for sedation.

She was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Surgical Intensive
Care Unit where she did well hemodynamically, and was
subsequently extubated on the night of surgery.  She remained
in sinus rhythm in the 60s to 80s with blood pressures of
110s on Neo-Synephrine at 0.75 mcg/kg per minute.  Her
aprotinin was weaned off, and she was given a bolus of 500 cc
of hespan times one.  No blood products were utilized for
intermittent issues of hypotension during her efforts to wean
off of the Neo-Synephrine.  On blood gas on nasal cannula was
7.43 for a pH, PCO2 of 44, and PO2 was 97.  Base excess of 3.

She was subsequently found to have a hematocrit of 29.5
postoperatively, with a blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of
9 and 0.4.  Her PT 14 and INR of 1.4 with a PTT of 37.  On
examination postoperatively, she had a stable sternum with no
evidence of drainage.  She had a 3/6 systolic murmur that was
diminished from her [**3-3**] or [**4-2**] murmur preoperatively with a
positive systolic click heard.  Breath sounds were decreased
bilaterally.  Her abdomen was soft with bowel sounds.
Extremities were warm and well perfused with no evidence of
edema.  Neurologically, she was intact.  She was on p.o. pain
medications.

Pulmonary wise, she was extubated.  She was satting at 95% on
5 liters of nasal cannula.  Chest tubes had stayed in until
later that day, on postoperative day one, due to high output.
Cardiovascular wise, she was weaned off her Neo-Synephrine.
She was subsequently placed on Lasix, Lopressor, aspirin, and
Coumadin, and she was off of her aprotinin at this time.

Electrolytes were repleted as tolerated.  She was started on
a cardiac diet.  Her Foley catheter was left in place, and
she was started on her diuresis.  Her blood urea nitrogen and
creatinine were within normal limits at 9 and 0.4,
respectively.

Hematology/Infectious Disease wise, she did have a low-grade
temperatures postoperatively, but this was thought to be
secondary to atelectasis.  She was given pulmonary toilet and
was subsequently transferred to the floor on postoperative
day one after her Neo-Synephrine was weaned off.

She did well while on the floor and had no issues.  She was
hemodynamically stable.  Her blood pressures were around
100/55 with heart rate in the 70s.  Her sternum was stable,
and no evidence of drainage.  Her murmur was not present, and
she was in a regular rate and rhythm.  Her hematocrit was 29,
as stated.

By postoperative day three she was ambulating at a level III
with assistance.  Her chest tubes had been removed, and the
chest x-ray just showed bilateral pleural effusions with
possible fluid in the left fissure.  Questionable vascular
engorgement.  There was some borderline clinical evidence of
congestive heart failure, and she was noted to be wheezing
audibly on auscultatory examination by postoperative day
three.  She was subsequently given Lasix 20 mg intravenously
as well as given albuterol/Atrovent nebulizer treatments
q.6h. around the clock times 24 hours, which was then
subsequently changed to a meter-dosed inhaler p.r.n. q.6h.
These efforts resolved her cardiac and wheezing issues, and
she diuresed very well.

On [**2197-11-28**], she was now postoperative day four from
her Bentall and St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] aortic valve, and was alert and
oriented times three.  She had decreased wheezes and
continued her meter-dosed inhalers as needed with incentive
spirometry and other pulmonary toilet.  Her Lopressor was
titrated to 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., and she remained
hemodynamically stable with pressures in the 130s at this
time with heart rates in the 70s, in sinus.  Her Lasix was
increased to 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., and she was given K-Dur for
potassium repletion.

Renal wise, her blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 18
and 0.6.  Hematology/Infectious Disease wise, she remained
afebrile, and her hematocrit was 26 and stable.  She was
maintained on Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. with an INR of 1.7 on
this day.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  She was screened by rehabilitation

rehabilitation.  The discharge plan will be to discharge to
