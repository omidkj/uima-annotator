Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesia of the apex, akinesia of the apical portions of the
inferior, anterior and septal walls. The mid portions of the
septal, inferior, inferoseptal and anterior walls are also
hypokinetic. . Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %). with borderline normal RV free
wall function. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results on [**2179-3-15**] at 1000am.

Post bypass

Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine, milrinone and epinephrine. LVEF=25%. Mild
moderate mitral regurgitation persists. Aorta is intact post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to the hospital for pre-operative evaluation and work
up.  Heparin was initiated for ostial LAD disease.  Echo
revealed chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 15-20%.  He was brought to the operating room on
[**2179-3-15**] where the he underwent coronary artery bypass graft.
See operative report for further details.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  Vancomycin was used for surgical
antibiotic prophylaxis given his inpatient stay of longer than
24 hours preoperatively.  POD 1 found the patient extubated,
alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamics were maintained with
milrinone, which was eventually weaned.  He continued to
progress and was transferred to the floor.  Physical therapy
worked with him on strength and mobility.  He was ready for
discharge home with services on postoperative day four.
