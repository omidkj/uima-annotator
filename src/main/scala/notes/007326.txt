Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 545**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
31yM 3 days ago presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for planned
pilonidal cyst excision. By report, pt difficult intubation,
blood
noted in ETT at the time of intubation. Procedure aborted, pt
kept intubated in ICU overnight, underwent bronch which did not
show abnormalities. Extubated the next day, discharged home.
Since then, patient with persistent throat pain as well as
progressive SOB. No fevers. No voice change. Went to BIN ED,
imaging per report in the ED c/w R pneumonia. Pat hypoxic to
92%, was given CTX, LEVO, and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] given concern
for airway obstruction.

In [**Hospital1 **] ED, seen by ENT, underwent scope that showed erythema and
very mild edema likely consistent with his h/o traumatic
intubation. No lacerations or focal injuries to the glottis.
Airway widely patent with no signs of impending upper airway
obstruction.
Labs notable for WBC 15K, lactate 1.9, nl Chem 7 and coags, CK
262 w/ MB 4, TnT 0.05. UA was negative.
Patient underwent CTA that per prelim report was negative for
PE, but showed b/l lower lobe patchy opacities, c/w aspiration.
Flagyl was added. Given the patient's low O2 Sats, he was
transferred to ICU for monitoring.

Of note, finished 10-day [**Last Name (un) 10128**] of  amoxicillin, bactrim, and
flagyl for buttock abscess drainage starting [**2190-3-10**].

Other Studies:
--------------
TTE ([**3-30**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. At least moderate
pulmonary hypertension. Low normal left ventricular systolic
function. Right ventricle not well visualized.


Brief Hospital Course:
31yo obese man with h/o asthma admitted with respiratory
distress and possible aspiration pneumonia.

# Respiratory distress/Pneumonia, possibly
aspiration/asthma/likely OSA:
Respiratory distress multifactorial in setting of underlying
asthma, likely OSA, and restrictive lung disease from obesity
with superimposed aspiration pneumonia. continued ceftriaxone
(day 1 = [**3-26**]), which was changed to Cefpodoxime on discharge.
He will complete a 10-day course of this.  Changed levo to
azithromycin (day 1 = [**3-27**]) and he will complete a 5-day course
of this. Treated asthma exacerbation with PO steroids for five
days total. Administered albuterol and atrovent nebulizers.
Initiated BiPAP for patient, which seemed to improve his overall
energy level.  Per ENT, provided pt with humidified air and gave
PPI TID with meals to protect larynx from reflux. Sent a DFA for
flu, which was negative. Pt has an outpatient sleep study for
OSA in order to obtain BiPAP at home.

# Elevated cardiac enzymes/Lymphedema:
Symptoms of dyspnea could be from acute cardiac ischemia.
Alternatively, he could have had subclinical cardiac ischemia
that has resulted in poor cardiac function, thus developing LE
edema over the last 2 months. EKG shows sinus tachycardia
without ischemic changes. Trended cardiac enzymes which were
decreased with flat CK MB. Continued ASA. A TTE was as above,
which was notable for elevated PA pressures, which could be c/w
an undiagnosed OSA.  The EF was 50-55%.

# Tachycardia:
Per patient??????s fianc??????, he is tachycardic at baseline. TSH was
normal. patient was given IV fluids with marginal repsonse.
Prior to discharge HR was in 90s.

# Pilonidal cyst: deferred excision given acute illness.  He
will follow up for a local excision.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Pneumonia, likely aspiration
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (likely)
Pulmonary Hypertension
Elevated cardiac enzymes
Pilonidal cyst
Asthma, acute on chronic
Hypoxemic respiratory failure

Discharge Condition:
Afebrile, vital signs stable, ambulating without difficulty.

Discharge Instructions:
You will need to complete your course of antibiotics.  You will
need to take cefpodoxime for 6 more days (10-day total course)
and azithromycin for one more day (5 day total course).  You
will need to take prednisone for one more day (complete 5-day
course).  You can use an albuterol inhaler as needed.
.
You will need to have your outpatient sleep study as schedule so
that you can be started on the BiPAP machine.  While in the
hospital, your settings were 12 IPAP/8 EPAP with 2L oxygen.
