Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
Type 3 endo leak with rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Revision of previously placed modular aortic
stent graft with 32 x 125 aorto uni iliac graft on the right
and a 16 x 95 Endograft extender cuff on the left via
bilateral femoral cutdowns and arteriography

History of Present Illness:
This 88-year-old gentleman underwent placement
of a modular bifurcated aortic stent graft for abdominal
aortic aneurysm about 5-1/2 years ago. He subsequently
developed left limb occlusion and had a thrombectomy of the
limb and placement of a balloon expandable stent in the left
common iliac artery at a point of kinking.  The balloon
expandable stent was actually within the left limb of the
previously-placed graft. He had not been seen in this
institution since [**2146**] and was med flighted up from the
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital this evening, complaining of abdominal and
flank pain with some hypertension. He was found to have a
large type 3 endo leak due to component separation with
contained rupture of his abdominal aortic aneurysm. He is now
being taken emergently to the operating room.

ADDENDUM: The measurements of 3D reformats performed in the
imaging lab are as follows: The AAA diameter largest central
line axis is 71 x 78 mm, the AAA diameter largest in axial view
is 71 mm, the AAA volume is 306 cc, the lowest renal artery to
aortic bifurcation volume is 341 cc, the lowest renal artery to
iliac bifurcation volume is 381 cc. The lowest renal artery to
stent top distance was 29.2 mm, the stent end to right iliac
bifurcation distance was 42 mm, the stent end to left iliac
bifurcation distance was 53 mm.

HISTORY: 88-year-old male status post repair of an endoleak.

FINDINGS:

CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

There are several scattered mediastinal lymph nodes with the
largest measuring 18 x 8 mm in a pretracheal location. There is
an 11 x 8 mm pulmonary opacity in the left apex likely
representing fibrotic scarring. There is a calcified granuloma
in the right upper lobe (image 46, series 3). There are multiple
calcified pleural plaques. There are bibasilar effusions and
passive atelectasis of the lower lobes.

CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

There are several subcentimeter low-attenuation foci in both
kidneys, likely cysts. There is a 26 x 17 mm low-attenuation
focus at the lower pole of the left kidney. In addition, there
is a 7 x 9 mm exophytic low-attenuation focus at the lower pole
of the left kidney. The foci at the lower pole of the left
kidney are worrisome for neoplasm.

The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas
appear unremarkable. There is a 104 x 58 mm right paraaortic
hematoma in the mid abdomen, previously 95 x 54 mm (image 81,
series 5). There is almost complete resolution of the
perisplenic hematoma. There is stable perirenal stranding and
thickening of the Gerota's fascia.

CT PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

The prostate gland measures 60 x 47 mm. There are multiple
calcific foci within the prostate gland. There is perirectal
stranding and minimal free fluid in the pelvis, unchanged since
the prior examination. There are fluid collections in the
inguinal regions in keeping with the recent endovascular repair.

MUSCULOSKELETAL:

There are multilevel degenerative changes present in the spine.
There is a small ventral abdominal hernia.

CT ANGIOGRAM:

There is extensive atherosclerosis present in the coronary
arteries, thoracic, abdominal aorta and its branches. The
coronary arteries arise from the normal expected anatomical
location. There is a stent present in the proximal right
coronary artery.

The ascending aorta at the level of the right main pulmonary
artery measures 37 x 37 mm. The aorta at the level of the left
inferior pulmonary vein measures 30 x 31 mm. There are multiple
ulcerated plaques present in the descending thoracic and the
abdominal aorta.

The abdominal aorta at the level of the celiac artery measures
31 x 27 mm. There is atherosclerotic plaque present at the
origin of the celiac artery. The superior mesenteric artery is
patent. There is a single patent right renal artery and a single
patent left renal artery.

The stent in the abdominal aorta starts just above the superior
mesenteric artery. The infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm
measures 82 x 73 mm, previously 80 x 74 mm. There is
high-attenuation material within the thrombus in the abdominal
aorta suggestive of an endoleak.

There is extensive atherosclerosis present in the iliac arteries
which are ectatic. The right common iliac artery before the
bifurcation measures 17 mm in maximum transverse diameter.

CONCLUSION:

1. Minimal interval increase in the size of the infrarenal
abdominal aortic aneurysm with appearances suggestive of an
interim endoleak as described above.

2. Two low-attenuation foci at the lower pole of the left kidney
are worrisome for neoplasm and may be further assessed with a
dedicated renal MRI.

3. Bibasal effusions and a small pericardial effusion with
passive atelectasis of the lower lobes.

4. Calcified pleural plaques, mediastinal lymph nodes and 12 x 8
mm ill- defined opacity in the left upper lobe likely represents
fibrosis, however, a repeat chest CT in six months would be
helpful to assess stability.
