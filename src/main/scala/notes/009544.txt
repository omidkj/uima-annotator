Chief Complaint:
sob

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66-year-old woman with COPD who presented with
increasing cough and dyspnea over the last several days. She ran
out of her nebulizer treatments at home yesterday but has had
worsening cough over the past 3 days and claims she was using
her albuterol nebs right up until she came in to the ED. She
denies subjective fevers/chills and describes her cough as dry.

In the ED, she was given albuterol and atrovent nebulizer
treatments, Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV x1, and Levofloxacin 750 mg IV
x1. Her sat was 89% on RA on arrival and improved to 94% on 3-4L
NC. End tidal CO2 25-30%. She was noted to be tachypneic to high
20's/low 30's despite nebs so is transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name **] for further
management.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was stable, speaking in full sentences
and 90-93% on 2L by nasal cannula. She admits to smoking [**1-5**]
cigarettes per day since being discharged and had been off her
steroid taper 3-4 days prior to the onset of her current
symptoms. She continues to complain of her cough, but denies
f/c/n/v/d/c or chest pain.

5. Osteoporosis
6. Arthritis
7. Urinary incontinence
8. Congenital nystagmus


Social History:
Smokes about 4 cigarettes a day but used to smoke much more
(long smoking history). Denies alcohol or illicits. Lives alone
in her own appartment at the [**Hospital1 **] Community housing for the
elderly. Does her own ADLs, walks independently. She has a

Physical Exam:
ON ADMISSION:
VITALS: T 98.1, HR 105, BP 109/73, RR 18-24, O2 sat 90-94% 2L NC

GEN: 66 yo F laying in bed, mildly anxious, +dry cough, NAD, can
speak essentially in full sentences
HEENT: AT/NC, EOMI with stationary horizontal nystagmus, PERRL,
OP clear, MM mildly dry (but mouth breathing).
NECK: supple, no cervical/supraclavicular LAD. JVP at 6cm
CV: RRR, s1, s2. no m/r/g
LUNGS: Decreased air flow diffusely with decreased BS at L base
(likely decreased lung volumes secondary to kyphosis), no
wheezes/rales/rhonchi. No egophany. Dullness to percussion at
both bases.
ABD: soft, NT/ND +BS
EXT: warm and well perfused, 2+ distal pulses
SKIN: warm and dry, no rashes


Pertinent Results:
CXR: Comparison is made to [**2123-7-2**]. The lung volumes are low,
in fact lower than on the prior study. Within that limitation,
cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged. There are
probable small bilateral effusions with adjacent areas of minor
atelectasis, but otherwise the lungs appear clear. The pulmonary
vascularity is within normal limits.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) COPD flare: Pt treated with steroids and azithromycin.  Pt
has had multiple flares in past months in setting of completing
steroid taper.  I discussed with PCP and together decided on
plan to continue prednisone at 40 mgs until pt sees PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 5
days and at that time PCP will further decide on tapering
timeline.  Of note, pt had small bl pleural effusions, not
previously seen and so should have an outpt echo for eval of
possible heart failure.

Another problem that may have contributed to the pt's flare is
that she did not have all of her medications.  The reason for
this is that she was unable to refill because of lack of funds.
Pt keeps her savings in a savings bank in [**Hospital1 3494**], and has a
difficult time getting to this far away location.  In the outpt
setting, it may be worth PCP and social work discussing
streamlining this process.

2)Schizophrenia: All medications continued.

3)HTN: Continued on home dose of atenolol.  Please note that in
past hospitalizations pt has also been on CCB, and did not
tolerate this combination as an outpt.  During this
hospitalization, HTN well controlled on atenolol alone.
