Ms [**Known lastname 71796**] is a 63 yo F with a history of CLL diagnosed in
[**2187**], and asthma, who presented with chest pain which started
while on the toilet at 11pm the night before [**Date range (1) 41463**]. She
characterized her pain as sudden in conset, substernal heaviness
[**5-26**], persistently pressing and radiating to her back. She does
not that she occasionally has chest pain w/her asthma but that
this was different in that it did not resolve. At that time she
denied n/v or pain radiating to the jaw or arm but did notice
some SOB and diaphoresis. Given the persistent chest pain, the
pt presented to ED. Family had noted that pt had complained of
non-specific gastrointestinal complaints over the last week (no
fevers) as well as more frequent asthma symptoms this summer w/
some chest discomfort associated w/ these symptoms.
.
Chest pain was sudden onset, substernal heaviness [**5-26**] that came
on at 11pm while at home. She mentions that she does sometimes
get chest pain with her asthma, but this pain was unusual as it
didn't go away. She did have associated diaphoresis, and the
pain radiated to her back. No nausea.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.4 89 153/82 18 97. Patient had
[**6-26**] chest heaviness. Trop was found to be 0.10. Patient
recieved SL nitro and 4mg IV morphine and nitro gtt was started.
She also recieved ativan, and was started on a heparin gtt. MRI
of the chest was perfomred, which was negative for dissection.
Pt was transferred to the floor for further management at which
time her BP was ~130/70.
.
However, over the remainder of the night and early morning, she
continued to have persistent chest pain and significant EKG
changes were noted including T-wave inversions V3-V5 and ST
elevations in I and aVR just under 1mm. Second troponin was
0.21. These changes were new at 7am as compared to her admission
EKG from 11pm the night prior. We gave her nitro SL, heparin and
plavix bolus of 300mg. Pain resolved, but patient was scheduled
for stat cardiac catheterization. On cath, pt was found to have
a 60% ulcerated lesion in LAD, 2 drug eluting stents placed. R
heart cath showed wedge pressure of 33. Pt had nitro drip
titrated up and received 160mg of lasix and began actively
diuresing at which point chest pain improved. Bedside echo
showed akinesis of nateriorlateral wasll on prelim read.
.
On arrival to the CCU s/p cath, pt was stable condition after
placement of a drug eluting stent in the proximal LAD and was
admitted for further monitoring and management.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. Cardiac review of
systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
