Irinotecan s/p cycle 7 on [**2143-12-4**] who presents with fever,

.
Per patient had recently completed cycle 7 of irinotecan on
[**12-3**]. He had been in his USOH when he developed gradual onset
of non-productive cough with associated fevers to 101, cough,
and worsening bony back pain and "lung pain."  This was rated a
[**5-15**] pain and worsening over the last week. The patietn denied

morphine 4mg IV x1. Labs with relative leukocytosis of 10.8 with
2% bands. Stable anemia. UA was negative and blood and urine
cultures obtained. CXR was performed which was negative for any
intra-thoracic process but demonstrated interval increase in
osteous mets. A CTA showed stable ground glass opacities, no PE
or infiltrate. An EKG was consistent with sinus tachycardia.  He
received 3L IVF and HR improved to the 120's. Per chart biopsy
outpatient HR: 105-120s ST.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient reports continued pain in his

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
# Early stage lung cancer status post right upper lobectomy and
mediastinal lymph node dissection in [**2134-9-6**] without
evidence of recurrence
# Rectal Cancer: T3N2M0; diagnosed in [**9-/2141**]
- [**2141-9-6**]: the pt develops abdominal pain and lower GI
bleed, further investigation by colonoscopy reveals an ulcerated
4-5 cm mass in the mid rectum at 10cm, the pathology examination
of the biopsies shows poorly differentiated carcinoma.
- [**2142-3-7**]: the patient undergoes low anterior resection and
diverting loop ileostomy and mesenteric and periaortic
lymphadenectomy (T3N2M0, [**8-17**] lymph nodes involved, with a
distal
margin that was clear by < 1 mm, k-RAS wild time) after
completion of neo-adjuvant capecitabine-based chemoradiation
- [**5-14**] the patient started adjuvant therapy with FLOX (5-FU +
leucovorin 500 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, and 15 and oxaliplatin 85 mg
on
day 1,5 of four-week cycles).
- On [**6-13**]  a nonocclusive thrombus was demonstrated in the left
renal vein and the patient was started on anticoagulation.
- On [**2142-8-21**], he started cycle #4 of FLOX at reduced
dose of 5-FU 400 mg/m2 only on D1,15 and oxaliplatin at 85 mg/m2
on D1,15.  He subsequently completed two more cycles, the last
one being on [**2142-10-16**]. Therapy was also complicated by
the developments on oxaliplatin-related neuropathy involving the
palms, feet and distal calves.
- [**2142-7-7**] bone scan and spine MRI showed multiple bone
metastasis, in [**2143-6-6**] a bone scan and now CT scan torso
showed
progression of bone metastates, but no evidence of other site of
metastatic disease.
- [**2143-7-24**] start palliative chemotherapy with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
Irinotecan (350 mg/m2 q21d)
- [**2143-10-9**] CT TORSO showed increased sclerotic bony metastatic
disease unclear if due to disease progression or response to
treatment.

Treatment History:
06/09,16,23: C1 FLOX (5-FU 500 mg/m2 D1,8,21 + Oxaliplatin 85
mg/m2 D1,15)
[**2142-6-13**]: C2 FLOX
*C2D1 changed from [**6-10**] to [**6-12**] due to development of
abdominal
pain and nausea. Urgent CT demonstrated nonocclusive thrombus of
left renal vein and interval enlargement of sclerotic focus in
left aspect of T12.
*Hospitalized [**Date range (1) 101702**] for neutropenic fevers (100.5, ANC
500,) LLQ pain, and dehydration. CT demonstrated small bowel
thickening suggestive of enteritis. Stool and blood cultures
negative. Discharged on course of Cipro + Flagyl.
[**2142-7-16**]: C3 FLOX
*Hospitalized [**Date range (1) 101703**] for weakness, abdominal pain, and
increased ostomy output and dehydration. CT revealed epiploic
appendagitis.
[**2142-8-21**]: C4 FLOX (5-FU 400 mg/m2 D1,15 + Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2
D1,15)
[**2142-9-18**]: C5 FLOX
[**2142-10-16**]: C6 FLOX
