Imaging:
CT abd/pelvis [**2115-12-30**]:
1. Dilated fluid-filled loops of small bowel measuring up to 3.4
cm with
decompressed colon and terminal ileum consistent with high-
grade small-bowel obstruction. One definite transition point
seen within the right lower quadrant (301b:26); however, a
second transition point may also be prsent within RLQ.
Suggestion of swirling of the mesentery and
abnormal configuration of small bowel loops raises the
possibility of internal hernia. Associated small amount of right
lower quadrant and pelvic free fluid along with mesenteric
stranding specifically in the right lower quadrant could be
related to congestive change, although early ischemia is not
excluded.
2. Interval increase in size of infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm, now
measuring 3.4 cm where on [**2-24**] it measured up to 2.8 cm.
Increased right
internal iliac aneurysm measuring 3.3 cm (measured 2.5cm in
[**2-24**]). Ectasia of the right common iliac artery measuring up to
1.5 cm.
3. Diverticulosis without secondary signs of diverticulitis.
4. Bronchiectasis and reticulation could relate to chronic
inflammatory/infectious changes within the bilateral lung bases.


CXR [**2115-12-30**]:
1. Bibasilar right greater than left atelectasis without
definite
superimposed pneumonia.
2. Nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm.

CXR [**2116-1-2**]:
1. Mild pulmonary edema is worsening since [**2115-12-31**].
2. Moderate bibasilar atelectasis is improved in the right and
stable on the left.
3. Left-sided pleural effusion is unchanged since [**2115-12-31**].

KUB [**2116-1-3**]:
1. Diffuse small bowel distention with gas seen within the colon
and rectum. This is a nonspecific pattern. Recommend follow-up.

CXR [**2116-1-6**]:
In comparison with study of [**1-2**], there is decrease in the
pulmonary vascular congestion with persistent bibasilar
atelectasis.
Increasing opacification at the left base could reflect
worsening atelectasis or increasing pleural effusion.
Persistent low lung volumes. Nasogastric tube has been inserted
with its tip in the body of the stomach.

CXR [**2116-1-7**]:
In comparison with the study of [**1-6**], the patient has taken a
somewhat better inspiration. Enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette persists in a patient with a dual-channel pacemaker
device in place. Bibasilar atelectasis is again seen without
definite effusion. The nasogastric tube has been removed.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department on
[**2115-12-30**] for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain, nausea,
and vomiting. In the emergency department, the patient was
resuscitated, and a foley/NGT were placed with moderate relief
of abdominal pain.  He was then admitted to the general surgery
service, NPO, IVF.  On the morning following admission, the
patient was complaining of increased abdominal pain and was
focally and markedly tender with guarding in the RLQ. Given his
worsening exam and CT findings of high-grade SBO with potential
internal hernia, the patient was taken to the operating room.
Thus, on [**2115-12-31**], the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy
with lysis of adhesions.  He was found to have one adhesion
causing the obstruction.  This was taken down.  No bowel was
resected.  The operation went well without complications (reader
referred to the Operative Note for details).
While in the PACU, the patient experienced a 30 second run of
ventricular tachycardia with a fall in SBP to the 60s.  The
patient spontaneously converted (back to NSR) and did not
receive a shock.  He regained an SBP within normal limits.  EKG
at that time showed sinus rhythm with frequent ventricular
premature beats. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2115-12-30**]
there was no significant diagnostic change. Cardiac enzymes were
negative x 3.  EP was called to evaluate his ICD, which had been
placed in [**2106**] for intermittent Vtach.  The ICD was functioning
properly, and EP did not recommend changing the settings.
Cardiology also saw the patient and recommended restarting his
home aggrenox and carvedilol when possible.  (The patient had
been placed on IV lopressor while NPO).

[**2116-1-1**]
The rest of his PACU stay was uneventful, and the patient
arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter,
NGT, and on tele.  He was receiving IV dilaudid for pain
control, which was switched to IV morphine and toradol. The
patient was hemodynamically stable. However, his mental status
had changed from AAOx3 to AAOx2.  His narcotics were stopped and
replaced with tylenol. Electrolytes were checked and repleted,
and he was reoriented frequently.  He self-d/c'd his NGT, and it
was decided not to replace it.  Patient was kept NPO.

[**2116-1-2**]
Mental status did not improve, and the patient became combati
