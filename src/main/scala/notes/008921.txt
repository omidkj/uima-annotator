CXR: IMPRESSION:

Cardiomegaly, interstitial pulmonary edema, small bilateral
pleural effusions.

CT: Abd/Pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute pathology is identified to explain the patient's
symptom.  No
evidence of bowel ischemia or arterial dissection is identified.


2.  Anasarca is present and there is a small amount of free
fluid within the
pelvis.
3.  Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.

Echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis. There is turbulent color
flow around the left main coronary artery coursing anteriorly.
This may reflect hyperemic coronary flow, but a coronary artery
A-V fistula cannot be excluded.  Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic  valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.  There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The  tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
HPI: Briefly, 63 yo F w/ CAD, h/o stroke with subsequent
hemiparesis, HTN, hyperlipidemia, DJD, DM type 2, CKD (baseline
Cr 1.2-1.4) and cortical blindness who came to ED w/ 3 days of
N/V. She had troponin leak. The N/V was thought ot be angina

the gap closed. The insulin drip was stopped and pt was started
on RISS. The pt conitnues to be nauseous and is not tolerating

.
On the floor, the patient was transitioned to lantus 10 units
qhs and restarted on metformin.  Her hematocrit remained at her
pre-admission baseline and near post-transfusion levels.  CT of
the abdomen revealed no evidence of any acute intra-abdominal
process.  USD of the lower extremity was negative for any DVT.
Patient was restarted on at home meds on discharge.  Her
hospital course was otherwise uncomplicated.
