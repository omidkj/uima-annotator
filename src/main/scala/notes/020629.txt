Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Methyldopa / Atenolol / Codeine / Norvasc

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
hypercarbic respiratory failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal extubation (intubated at rehab facility)

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82 yo M with h/o COPD (FEV1 0.56 in [**2168**]) and
recent hospitalization for pneumonia, discharged from here to
[**Hospital **] rehab on [**5-11**]. Today he was noted to be dyspneic. He was
given nebs and an extra dose of steroids and an ABG showed
7.3/79/126/39. He failed bipap and was intubated at [**Hospital1 **] and
transferred here. In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.2 P 103  BP
123/87 R 17 O2 sat 100. Patient was given cefepime, levo, 2L NS,
nebs and propofol.
.
On review of [**Hospital1 **] records, he was achypneic to 24 on routine
vitals today and yesterday. Hypertensive this am to 179/95.
Overall net positive fluid balance over past week >3L.
.
On discussion with RN at [**Hospital1 **], the patient has been
non-compliant with bipap using it for several hours a night at
the most. He was transfered to the more acute floor at [**Hospital1 **]
last night for an acute worsening of dyspnea. An ABG in the
evening of [**5-27**] showed 7.31/79/73/39. He was non-compliant with
bipap. Patient was mildly confused. No cough [**Name8 (MD) **] RN. No
increased sputum. No fevers. Again this morning, he appeared
very short of breath. A series of ABGs showed:
7.3/79/126/39  @0653
7.2/108/135/43 @0849
7.3/76/46/40   @1030
He was encouraged to wear the bipap but he was non-compliant and
in fact was given the option of bipap or intubation and
consented to the intubation. He was then intbutaed and given 5mg
versed and total 10mg diazepam. He was also given 60mg IV
methylpred @1400.
.
On arrival he is sedated and intubated but responds to verbal
stimuli. He complains of pain and points to his lower abdomen.
He confirms that pain is the bladder spasm pain. His family is
present and states that he had been doing well but seemed much
worse last night with labored breathing and audible wheezes and
also lethargic. They are not aware of any precipitating events
and are not aware if was aspirating.
.
Of note, they also states that he had been DNR/DNI but reversed
code status for them.

Imaging:
========
CXR [**5-28**]: The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The ET tube tip is
approximately 7 cm above the carina. There is no change in
severe upper lung emphysema and multifocal bilateral
consolidations. Consolidation is better delineated on the CT
chest obtained on [**2171-5-28**] .
.
CTA [**5-28**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Multifocal pneumonia.
3. Moderately severe centrilobular emphysema.
.
ECHO [**5-29**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast at rest. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse or regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent
fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved ejection fraction. Right
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function. At
least moderate pulmonary hypertension. No intracardiac shunt by
bubble study (only done at rest).
.
CXR [**5-31**]: The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina. The PICC
line tip is at the level of low SVC. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. Bibasal consolidations are unchanged as
well as upper lung emphysema. Overall no significant change
since the most recent prior radiograph is noted. As compared to
more remote radiographs from [**2171-5-28**] the appearance is
unchanged as well.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
82yo M with COPD p/w hypercarbic respiratory failure and
pneumonia who had a progressively declining clinical course and
eventually expired after transitioning care to comfort measures
only.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure ?????? patient was admitted
intubated from rehab though previously DNI, his code status was
reversed after he was found hypoxic at his facility. He was
ruled out for PE on admission and imaging revealed volume
overload, multifocal pneumonia, and severe underlying emphysema.
No evidence of ACS on admission. Patient was continued on
vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin for HCAP coverage without
