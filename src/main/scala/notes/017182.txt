History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4033**] is a 66 year old man with history of CAD s/p CABG,
EtOH cirrhosis s/p TIPS, and COPD (unknown PFT's) who presents
with one day history of shortness of breath. He reports that the
evening of [**6-6**], he started feeling more short of breath. His
home oxygen and home nebulizers were not helpful, and his
shortness of breath worsened on [**6-7**], so he came to the ED. He
is on home oxygen (2L) at all times.

In the ED, his triage vitals were T97.9F, HR 68, BP 104/58, RR
26, Sat 97% (unclear oxygen). He received 500mg azithromycin,
aspirin suppository, 125mg methylprednisolone, and albuterol and
ipratropium nebs. The patient repeatedly stated that he did not
want to be intubated, and ED staff confirmed this with his PCP.


On arrival to the ICU, he was on BiPap, which was quickly
converted to face mask when he appeared dissynchronous. He
confirms history as above. ABG on arrival is pH 7.36, pCO2 72,
pO2 83, HCO3 42. His oxygen was downtitrated to nasal cannula.
He reports improvement in his breathing, and denies chest pain,
orthopnea, palpitations, abdominal pain, pleuritic chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, constipation, diarrhea, fevers,
chills, productive cough.

Brief Hospital Course:
66yM with history of COPD, CAD, EtOH cirrhosis presenting with
shortness of breath x 1 day, without cough, fever, chills, or
chest pain, consistent with exacerbation of known COPD.

#) Shortness of breath. Given constellation of symptoms, known
history, physical exam findings, ABG, and chest x-ray,
consistent with COPD exacerbation. Blood gas is quite reassuring
with near-normal acid-base status (despite quite elevated pCO2),
indicative of severe COPD. Azithromycin was started given the
severity of his exacerbation, although as his initial MICU stay.
He got methylprednisolone 125mg q8h, azithromycin 500 followed
by 250 x4 more days, and albuterol/ipratropium nebs. In the
MICU, he was stable and did not require additional ventilatory
support. He has a past diagnosis of OSA and apparently has
sometimes used BiPAP at home, although not recently because his
machine is broken; also he seems not to like the mask. He
declined BiPAP with the MICU team and at any rate was satting
better on his 30% face mask. On the floor, patient did have
intermittent bouts of shortness of breath , often at times in
the setting of agitation. He refused additional nebulizers or
morphine. However, overall he remained stable with oxygenation
of 95% on 2L even while appearing more short of breath. He
stated that he was close to his baseline at time of discharge.
.
Given severity of lung disease, attempt was made to discuss
hospice care, however, patient refused to speak with our
palliative care service. He also refused acute rehab at this
time. Per discussion with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] refusal of therapies and
rehab are not uncommon.


#) CAD. Has known history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG
with PCI in [**2097**]. He was ruled out for MI. Continued aspirin,
statin.

#) EtOH cirrhosis s/p TIPS. Not active.  Tylenol maximum 2g
daily.

#) Anemia. Baseline hematocrit ~40. No history of melena or
hematemesis. Will check iron studies, guaiac stool.

#) Depression. Continued paroxetine 10mg daily.

#) BPH. Continued dutasteride and tamsulosin.

#) Code Status. DNI, confirmed with patient.
