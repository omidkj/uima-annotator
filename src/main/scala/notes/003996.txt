Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
PICC line placed and removed


History of Present Illness:
69 year old female with CAD s/p MI and CABG '[**09**] presents with
intermittent chest pain x 1 week, worse in last 3 days with
shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling. Patient was
recently seen by PCP and aldactazide was d/c'ed on [**12-19**] and
lasix was d/c'ed on [**2124-1-19**] (in setting of worsening renal
function -lasix d/c'ed). In past couple weeks she notes
increasing SOB, 10-lb wt gain and increasing dyspnea on
exertion. She also noted intermittent chest pain during this
period but worse in past 3 days. She has slept sitting up for
the past 8 months. She came to ED after becoming very short of
breath on morning of admission. EKG q wave anterior ?ST
elevation in III. She was started on heparin gtt and nitro gtt.
She went to cath lab and found to have 90%lesion in OM which was
ballooned opened (couldn't stent). In the recovery area, patient
SOB lying flat (likely h/o OSA although none diagnosed). She was
on a non-rebreather satting 97%.
.
She was transferred to the CCU for further management. ABG in
the holding area on NRB was 7.29/57/148. On arrival to the CCU
she was placed on BiPAP, PS 10 PEEP 5, FiO2 50%. Her ABG on
noninvasive ventilation was 7.36/53/146. After approximately [**12-14**]
hours, she was feeling sufficiently less short of breath to be
weaned to nasal cannula, at which point her ABG was 7.39/49/67.

.
Initial vitals in the ED: 97.8, 98, 152/72, 20, 88% on RA. She
was given ASA, heparin gtt, lasix and sent to the cath lab.
.
On review of systems, + for non-productive cough X 3 weeks, and
post-nasal drip. She has gained 10 pounds over the past 2 weeks.
She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

IMAGING
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2124-3-1**]
This AP bedside radiograph is limited by patient's large size.
The heart is probably enlarged with previous CABG. No vascular
congestion. I doubt the presence of consolidations. I cannot
exclude effusions particularly on the right. Other than the
equivocal pleural changes on current examination there is a
little change from more satisfactory bedside exam [**2123-10-11**].
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal exam. No pneumonia and I doubt the
presence of CHF.
.
[**2124-3-1**] CARDIAC CATH: report pending
.
[**2124-3-2**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. No
masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is
moderately-to-severely depressed (30 percent) secondary to
global hypokinesis
with regional variation (the inferior and posterior walls appear
more
hypokinetic). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2122-2-24**], the left ventricular ejection fraction now appears
reduced, but the
technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes
certainty.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old female with CAD s/p MI and CABG, DMII, obesity, CHF
p/w NSTEMI in setting of CHF exacerbation.
.
#. Congestive heart failure. Ejection fraction on this admission
30% from 45% on last stress test [**2121**]. The patient was volume
overload on admission and soon became oliguric as below despite
escalating doses of lasix. The patient's oxygen saturations
remained stable. The patient was followed by Renal and may need
dialysis if urine output does not improve. The patient's
ACE-inhibitor was held for renal failure. The patient has not
tolerated a beta-blocker in the past and had one episode of
junctional bradycardia during admission. The patient should have
a repeat echocardiogram in two months for consideration of ICD
placement.
.
#. Acute renal failure. The patient remained oliguric/anuric and
volume overloaded but oxygen saturations remained stable. The
renal failure is likely contrast nephropathy. Her Diovan and
HCTZ were stopped given renal failure. The patient was followed
by Renal during admission, and creatinine gradually improved
from 6.1 to 2.0 on day of discharge. She will need to follow-up
with PCP one week after discharge to have kidney function
evaluated and further address resuming [**Last Name (un) **] and/or diuretics.
.
#. Coronary artery disease. The patient is status post CABG in
[**2109**] and admitted with NSTEMI on this admission now status post
cardiac catheterization on [**2124-3-1**] with no obvious source for
STEMI. The patient received PCTA to 90% stenosis of OM2. The
NSTEMI was likely demand ischemia from CHF exacerbation in
setting of discontinuation of diureti
