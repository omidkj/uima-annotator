History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 8529**] is a 61 y/o f with h/o of CAD s/p multiple stents, most
recently [**2125-7-19**] ostial RCA Promus and RPDA promus, LCX Taxus,
PCI ostial LAD promus for instent restenosis of the RCA, RPDA,
LCX and LAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, rheumatoid arthritis,
restrictive lung disease who was transferred from OSH for
possible cholangitis. Patient complained of some chest
discomfort on the night of [**11-2**] while eating dinner and was
noted to have elevated cardiac biomarkers.
.
Patient reports on [**11-2**] she was eating dinner when she
developed sudden onset of head ache [**10-29**] which radiated to her
back. She became anxious and then developed throat "heaviness"
that subsequently radiated to her chest, which pt states is
consistent with her previous anginal and heart attack symptoms.
She took NTG and after 5 minutes the pain did not subside so she
took another nitroglycerine and then a third which improved the
CP slightly. She said the entire episode lasted about 20
minutes. The chest pressure was associated with diaphoresis and
SOB but pt denied palpitations, dizziness, nause, vomiting. She
was taken to the hospital by her husband and by the time she
reached [**Name (NI) 8530**] her chest pressure had subsided completely but
she did have some abdominal discomfort. In [**Location (un) **], she was
hypotensive and central line was placed. No EKG shown. She was
given stress dose steroids and put on pressors. Per report,
there were some gallbladder thickening and the initial thought
was hypotension/sepsis from a gallbladder source prompting her
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] with for management of possible cholangitis.
The week prior she endorsed increasing orthopnea having to sleep
upright and also noticed some increase LE swelling for which she
was taking [**2-22**] additional lasix 20 mg pills on top of her
morning 20 mg lasix.
.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 1516**], she denies any chest pain or shortness
of breath. She also denied abdominal pain. She was also
finishing her last day of azithromycin for an upper respiratory
infection. She reports that over the last 6 days, she has also
noticed increasing LE edema for which she has been taking
increasing doses of Lasix. She also complains of worsening
orthopnea. She is able to walk [**1-21**] blocks with no chest pain.
She can go up 1 flight of stairs but sometime has to stop for
SOB.

On cardiac review of symptoms as stated above. All other ROS
negative.
