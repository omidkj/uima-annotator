Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Lightheadness, coffee grounds emesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD, blood transfusions

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 year-old female with a history of who presents with
left PICA artery aneurysm s/p coiling [**3-16**], PVD s/p SMA
stenting, HTN, hyperlipidemia presents with light-headedness.
The patient reports that she was discharged from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 4117**]
Rehab 2 weeks ago.  She states that over the weekend she was
walking down the stairs and felt light-headed.  She states that
she "blacked out" for several seconds.  She continued to feel
dizzy and light-headed.  The following day she states she was
too weak to get out of bed and spent most of her time in bed.
She continued to feel dizzy and weak this AM.  She reports
vomiting coffee ground/black emesis x1.  She also reports
chronic black stools since she was started on Fe supplements
several months previously. Has been taking ASA 325mg, no other
NSAIDS.  She denied any hematochezia. She was seen by the VNA
today and advised to go to the ED.
.
She also reports chronic baseline cough.  However, she reports
that she has had increasing cough and sputum production. No
fevers or chills. She does report that her grandchilden have
been sick recently.
.
In the ED, VS 98.1, 123, 129/58, 18, 96%RA. Patient labs were
remarkable for a Hct of 17.7 (baseline low-mid 20's, severely Fe
deficient with ferritin of 6). On exam she was occult blood
positive, but no gross blood was seen. She was transfused 1U
pRBC, 2 PIV, and given 40mg IV protonix. She was also given 3L
IVF.  GI was consulted and aware. WBC was 11.0, lactate 2.7. CXR
showed possible early RUL pna and given 750mg levofloxacin.

The patient states the she had a EGD and colonscopy 1 month
prior at [**Hospital3 **] that was reportly normal. Per prior d/c
summary she underwent EGD and colonscopy on [**6-15**] at an OSH
which showed only ischemic colonic ulcer.

Imaging:
Chest xray:  Admission [**7-27**]

IMPRESSION: Right upper lung airspace opacity worrisome for an
early
pneumonia.

Most recent [**8-5**]:

1. A new right PICC line terminates in the mid SVC without
complications.

2. Stable right pulmonary nodule warrants further investigation.
PA and
lateral chest radiographs are recommended for better
visualization of this abnormality. In addition, a right lateral
decubitus view would be helpful to evaluate the right lower lung
abnormality.

Chest CT [**8-6**]:
1. New right upper lobe well-defined homogenous opacity is most
likely an
abscess, although a necrotic soft tissue tumor is also in the
differential.

Recommend 3-4 weeks of antibiotic treatment and follow up with
chest x-ray to assess any change in size of this nodule and
possible biopsy or PET scan at that stage if the mass remains
unchanged. appearances.

Right lower and middle lobe collapse with persistent minor
atelectasis with a smaller right pleural effusion. Slight
increase in the central lymph nodes as described athough these
are not pathological by CT size criteria.

Stable right renal cyst and left adrenal adenoma.


Brief Hospital Course:
66F h/o L PICA artery aneurysm s/p coiling [**3-16**], dysphagia, p/w
coffee grounds emesis and acute blood loss anemia.

1. Acute blood loss/anemia: On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 79194**] vital signs were stable and she was anemic to 17.7
(baseline Hct mid 20s secondary to Fe deficiency). Presumptive
diagnosis was upper GI source due to h/o coffee grounds emesis.
Melena hard to interpret due to Fe therapy. She received 1 units
PRBCs in the ED and 2 units in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with appropriate Hct
bumps. On hospital day 2 her Hct was stable in the low 30s
without transfusions over the past 24 hours. She has not had
further coffee grounds emesis. She was started on an IV PPI, put
on maintenance IVF, and was made NPO for planned EGD on hospital
day 2.  She underwent EGD, without obvious source.  Hct remained
stable in the high 20s for the last several days, with most
recent value 27.1.  She will need small bowel capsule study as
an outpatient.
.
2. Pneumonia: CXR at admission showed new infiltrate in RUL,
likely a pneumonia. WBC was 11 on day 1, up to 18.8 on day 2
(75% PMNs, no bands), but she remained afebrile. Initial lactate
was 2.7. Patient remained stable and did not complain of dyspnea
or cough. She was started on levofloxacin for CAP, with plans to
broaden coverage if clinical picture worsened given recent stay
at rehab. She was treated with levofloxacin, without clinical
improvement.  She then developed a rising O2 requirement, as
well as worsening leukocytosis.  CXR showed evolution of the
right middle lobe infiltrate, and then after a trigger for
hypoxia on [**8-4**], a new infiltrate on the right base.  This was
attributed to aspiration. Her antibiotics were broadened to
cefepime, vancomycin and flagyl.  With this combination, her
oxygen requirement improved and her leukocytosis improved. She
will complete a 3 week day course of cefepime and flagyl.  SHE
WILL NEED REPEAT CHEST XRAY IN 3 week VERIFY RESOLUTION, GIVEN
ROUNDED APPEARANCE OF PNEUMONIA IN RIGHT MID LUNG, AS WELL AS
DEVELOPMENT AT RIGHT BASE.  This was also evaluated on CT, and
appears consistent with pnemumonia, but could also reflect an
early abscess, not amenable to drainage.  Given clinical
improvement, she will be discharged on prolonged antibiotics
with repeat imaging before the course is over.

3. Left proximal PICA aneurysm w/mass effect on brainstem s/p
coiling: she was seen by neurosurgery, who recommended
outpatient follow up.  She had chronic dizziness treated by
meclizine.  Florinef was restarted.
.
4. Dysphagia:  She has had chronic dysphagia since her aneur
