Liver/GB U/S [**7-7**]
FINDINGS: The gallbladder is normal with no gallstones, no wall
thickening, and no pericholecystic fluid identified. There is no
biliary dilatation and the common duct measures 0.2 cm. No focal
liver lesion is identified. The pancreas is unremarkable, but is
only partially visualized due to overlying bowel. The spleen is
unremarkable and measures 7.7 cm. A scant trace of ascites is
seen in the perihepatic space. Small bilateral pleural effusions
are noted.

DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images
were
obtained. The main, right and left portal veins are patent with
hepatopetal flow. Appropriate arterial waveforms are seen in the
main, right and left hepatic arteries. Appropriate flow is seen
in the IVC, the hepatic veins, the SMV, and the splenic vein.

IMPRESSION:
1. No gallstones and no evidence of cholecystitis.
2. Patent hepatic vasculature.
3. Scant trace of ascites in the perihepatic space. Bilateral
pleural
effusions.

LUE U/S [**7-7**]
FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of
the left IJ, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and
cephalic veins. There is normal flow, compression and
augmentation seen in all of the vessels.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left arm.


CXR [**7-3**]
REASON FOR EXAM: CAD, hypertension, abdominal complaint, and
chronic renal
failure.

Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.

Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are new. Cardiac
size is
normal. There are bibasilar atelectases. There is mild pulmonary
edema.
Biapical pleural thickening is unchanged. There is no
pneumothorax.

[**7-3**] TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not pre
