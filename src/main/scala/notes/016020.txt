History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 77 yo with COPD who was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on
[**4-21**] for hypercarbic respiratory distress as well as increased
oxygen requirements in the setting of a COPD exacerbation
requiring BIPAP.  Pt originally presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on
[**2158-4-21**] from his nursing home where the nurses noted that he
looked tired from heavy breathing and had increased oxygenation
requiredments over the coarse of the day.  In discussing the
case with the nurses at the Nursing home, they report that he
had been having progressive difficulty breathing over the past
week.   During this time his lasix dose had been titrated down.
On [**2158-4-20**] he was taken to [**Hospital6 1597**] out of concern
for difficulty breathing.  There he was felt to be at his
baseline from a pulmonary standpoint but there was concern for
acute renal failure with a creatinine above baseline and so he
was treated with IVF for presumed over diuresis with lasix.  He
returned to the Nursing Home on [**4-21**] am and thereafter his
breathing worsened.

Of note, he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] 6 wks prior to presentation
for COPD exacerbation.  During that hospital coarse a CT chest
showed right middle lobe collapse.  The plan was to get a follow
up CXR in 6 weeks out of concern that pt may need a
bronchoscopy.

On arrival to the [**Name (NI) **] pt at first was able to mouth a few words
and answer questions. He noted that he had become progressively
more dyspnic over the last 1-2 days. Notes productive cough with
thick yellow sputum. No fevers or chills, does think that he was
having a more difficult time breathing when he was lying flat
for a nap today and asked to sit upright.  No chest pain, abd
pain or any other pain.

In the ED he was initially stable and planned to be admitted to
the floor.  He was given 2 L NS and shortly thereafter his
breathikng grew worse to the point that he could not speak more
than one word at a time. Additionally, at this time he was noted
to have increased wob, increased o2 requirements. He was given
levofloxacin, azithromycin, solumedrol, admitted to MICU.

In the MICU pt was on BIPAP from [**4-21**] am until [**4-22**] just after
midnight.  He was continued on 24 hours of solumedrol and
treated with Levofloxacin and Flagyl out of concern for post
obstructive pneumonia in the setting of RML collapse.  He was
given a dose of IV lasix due to concern that the acute nature of
the difficulty breathing was due to the IVF he had received in
the ED.  He rested off BIPAP and then restarted BIPAP on [**4-22**]
from 8am until 10am.  By the afternoon as he continued to breath
easily off BIPAP a ABG was check and was 7.40/53/92.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo man with severe COPD and HTN here with COPD exacerbation
and early LLL pna vs bronchitis.

Respiratory distress, primarily COPD exacerbation: Pt was
originally tachypnic, with limited air mvmt and +use of
accessorry muscles. He responded to diuresis, steroids,
andtibiotics and BIPAP. Most likely pt had a COPD exacerbation
which had been worsening over the past week. The IVF given at
the OSH and then in the ED were acompanied by superimposed
worsening so CHF may have also been a problem. There was some
concern in the MICU on admission that in the setting af
tachycardia nad hypoxia that pt may have a PE - given low
suspicion LENIs and D dimer were ordered. LENIs were negative,
d-dimer positive, but since by the afternoon both the hypoxia
and tachycardia had resolved and so further work up of PE was
discontinued.  He was continued on steroids, levofloxacin and
flagyl and respiratory status remained stable. Pulmonary was
consulted regarding posisble bronch for RML collapse, and did
not think a bronch was necessary. Legionella antigen was found
to be negative.  He will need to follow up with his outpatient
pulmonolist (at B+W) as an outpatient.  His advair was increased
to 500/50.

DM2: He was started in lantus last admission which has been
continued at rehab w/o need for SSI as much. Continued on lantus
here and followed glucose control as he was on steroids for COPD
exacerbation.  He was discharged on 6 units lantus QHS.

HTN: BPs remained stable. He was continued diltiazem and
lisinopril.

Hyperlipidemia: He was continued on his home statin dose.

BPH: He was continued on terazosin

Depression: He was continued on zoloft

Code: DNR/DNI, per records and signed nsg home form and
confirmed with pt.
