CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2174-10-15**] 8:04 PM

No subclavian line is present. There is no evidence of a
pneumothorax. The heart remains enlarged, right effusion is
present. Compared to the prior film of 5 hours earlier the
vasculature appears slightly more prominent and the degree of
failure may be now occurring.

IMPRESSION:

No pneumothorax, cardiomegaly with some evidence of failure.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2174-10-15**] 3:05 PM

AP CHEST: This study is limited by low lung volumes and
respiratory motion. The heart, mediastinal and hilar contours
are unchanged in the interval allow-
ing for differences in technique. The aorta is tortuous. There
is some elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with possible
atelectasis at the right base.

IMPRESSION: Limited study due to Low lung volumes and motion.

ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Conduction defect of right bundle-branch block
type. Low
QRS voltages in precordial leads. Since the previous tracing of
[**2173-9-30**]
ventricular ectopy is resolved


Brief Hospital Course:
1. PNA: Patient was admitted to the MICU and was aggressively
hydrated with fluids and treated with abx: azithromycin and
Ceftriaxone. He was pancultured with blood culture and urine
culture both negative. His sputum grew many diferent types of
oral flora. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test was done but was no longer needed as
patient quickly stabilized, no steroides were instituted. He was
stabilized and transferred to floor. Abx were continued,
Physical therapy and pulmonary toilet were both requested and
performed while on the floor. He was continued on his
alb/atrovent nebs for the wheezes. He was discharged stable on
room air without supplemental oxygen and on azithromycin and
cefpodoxime.
2. CAD: asa, lipitor were both continued while in the hospital.
He was noted to have elevated troponins but in review of his
records he has elevated troponins at baseline due to his CRI.
Thus, the small rise in his troponins on this admission was [**1-3**]
demand ischemia in setting of stress/hypotension. No further
workup was done.
CHF: stable, no evidence of heart failure. His Accupril was
restarted on day of discharge as his blood pressure had been
stable while on the floor for more than 24hours.
3. COPD: stable continued on fluticasone/salmeterol,
alb/atrovent, tiotropium
4. OSA: stable, continued on his outpatient doses of ritalin sr
and ritalin
5. HTN: restarted on Accupril 5mg once a day.
6. DM: stable, continued on his outpatient NPH doses, and RISS

timolol
8. Psych: stable continued on his outpatient meds
