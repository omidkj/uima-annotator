Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2155-3-31**] Aortic Valve Replacement(25mm CE Pericardial Valve)
[**2155-4-3**] Cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year old male with known bicuspid aortic valve who
presents with severe shortness of breath associated with cough
and hemoptysis. A SPECT Sestamibi ETT showed poor functional
capacity, limited by fatigue with hypotension at peak exercise.
Nuclear imaging showed global hypokinesis with inferior and
apical hypokinesis. Echocardiography revealed preserved LV
function and severe aortic stenosis of a bicuspid aortic
valve(mean 45 mmHg, [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.7cm2). Subsequent coronary
angiography showed no significant coronary artery disease in a
right dominant circulation. Based upon the above, he was
referred for cardiac surgical intervention. Of note, during a
previous preoperative workup, he was noted to have severe
stenosis of his right internal cartoid artery for which he
underwent successful carotid stent placment on [**2155-3-14**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. He had been on Plavix since that time.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o inf, eff

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old man with AS
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o inf, eff
INDICATION: 59-year-old man with a history of aortic stenosis
status post replacement.

COMPARISON: [**4-1**] and [**2155-3-10**].

FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST: Patient is status post median
sternotomy, with a prosthetic aortic valve in place. There are
small bilateral pleural effusions with associated lower lobe
atelectasis. The inspiration is improved compared to the prior
study. The cardiac and mediastinal contours still appear
prominent compared to preoperative studies, but are stable or
improved compared to the prior study of [**4-1**], given differences
in technique. Pulmonary vascularity does not appear engorged.
There are clips in the anterior superior mediastinum, unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions and lower lobe atelectasis.
2. Expected post-operative appearance to cardiac and mediastinal
contours.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
