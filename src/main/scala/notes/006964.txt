No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, tachycardia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
59 year old male with stage III (Tx N2 M0) GE junction
adenocarcinoma s/p 2 cycles of cisplatin and flurouracil ([**Month (only) **]
and [**Month (only) 205**]) and recent PE ([**6-30**] on lovenox) who presents with poor
PO intake, nausea, vomiting x 2 weeks, now with hypotension to
the 80s and a-fib with RVR 130s-150s. He has been being seen by
a visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) 1023**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6349**] him today and found him to be
tachycardic and hypotensive and referred him to the ED. He has
been asymptomatic with the exception of nausea and vomiting and
right elbow tenderness and erythema. He denies fever and chills.
He denies SOB, CP, palps, myalgias, cough, dysuria, sore throat
or diarrhea.  He denies feeling dehydrated, and he says that
he's been urinating a few times a day without difficulty.

In the ED, initial vitals were 97.8 72 (not real) 94/65 16 100%
RA. He was given 5L of NS.  Chest X-Ray was unremarkable. Pt was
in a-fib with RVR and a rate of 130s-150s. Due to hypotension,
no medications were given for rate control. Due to recent PE, CT
was obtained and showed decreased clot burden and stable
infarct. Out of concern for possible infectious etiology,
vancomycin 1g and 2g cefepime were given. Due to refractory
hypotension, peripheral neosynephrine was started.

On the floor, he's lying in bed comfortable. without complaint.

MICRO:
BLOOD CULTURE X2 ([**8-16**]): NO GROWTH

ECG ([**8-16**]): RATE 154, Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2163-6-30**] atrial fibrillation is new.

CHEST PORTABLE ([**8-16**]):
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

CTA ([**8-16**]):
1. Interval decrease in clot burden involving subsegmental
branches of
posterior basal segment of right lower lobe since [**2163-6-30**].
2. 2.3 x 1.3 cm enlarging subpleural perifissural right lower
lobe nodule,
concerning for metastatic pleural disease. Additional scattered
sub 4 mm
bilateral pulmonary nodules appear stable since at least [**2163-6-30**].
3. Minimal upper zone interlobular septal thickening may reflect
volume
status.
4. Stable distal esophageal thickening, compatible with
esophageal carcinoma.
5. New perifissural hepatic hypodensity, incompletely assessed
on current
examination. Although this may represent focal fatty
infiltration, given
history of malignancy, dedicated hepatic imaging is recommended
to exclude
metastasis.
6. Likely right axillary vein thrombosis. Recommend DVT study
for
confirmation

ECHO ([**8-17**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Left ventricular regional function is probably
normal though views are technically suboptimal. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

US ELBOW R ([**2163-8-17**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No fluid collection seen at the right elbow within the
superficial
tissues.
2. Indeterminate soft tissue density adjacent to the right
humerus. If there
is clinical concern an MRI could further characterize this area

UE DOPPLER ([**8-17**]):
IMPRESSION: Acute right axillary vein thrombosis

XR R ELBOW ([**8-17**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No fluid collection seen at the right elbow within the
superficial
tissues.
2. Indeterminate soft tissue density adjacent to the right
humerus. If there
is clinical concern an MRI could further characterize this area.


CXR ([**8-18**]):
FINDINGS: There is new faint opacity in the left lower lobe
which could
