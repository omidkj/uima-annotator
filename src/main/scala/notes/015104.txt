Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2927**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 yo woman with a history of Large B cell Lymphoma,
s/p SCT [**2158**], complicated by intra-parenchymal and SDH and
subsequent seizures with baseline aphasia who presents with
confusion and worsening gait. Of note she has had multiple
admissions for the same symptoms and recent admission [**Date range (1) 69952**]
for altered mental status (worsening gait, aphasia) of unclear
etiology though seemed to improve with antibiotics (though no
clear infection). Of note her MS waxed and waned during that
admission with no evidence of seizure activity corresponding,
negative LP and MRI. She does have a chronically trapped left
ventricle so neurosurgery was consulted regarding semi-elective
stereotactic drainage of her chronically trapped left ventricle
when all infectious issues resolved. Regarding infection she had
c.diff neg x2, WBC on UA but culture negative (was treated with
ceftazidime transitioned to cefixime for discharge-[**Date range (1) 69953**] for
10 day course). She was also treated briefly with levofloxacin
starting on admit [**2-29**] for cough, but returned + for influenza
B.

She returned to the ED today with complaint of functional
decline at home, characterized by increased episodes of
agitation and yelling. Per her husband this she was doing better
on discharge [**3-13**] but not back to baseline. In the several days
prior to admission, she had a slowly decline, with episodes of
aggitation (sometimes aggressive), worsening aphasia, and
worsening ambulation (she was unable to get to bathroom,
seemingly unable to move her feet). Of note she had a couple of
falls at home recently. Her husband reports this is very similar
to her presentation in [**Month (only) **] and when she was admitted [**10-15**].
He notes no focal symptoms at home (no cough, HA, sob, nausea,
vomitting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, dysuria,
rash).

In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.2 rectal P 66 BP 192/66 R 18 O2
100% RA. BP down to 116/59 after ativan. Patient was given
ativan 1mg iv x2 for agitation with good effect, though on
previous admit had paradoxical rxn to ativan and responded well
to haldol. She was seen in the ED by the neurology service and
thought to have no new neurologic symptoms on exam. Head Ct neg.

On arrival to the floor, she was found to less responsive and
difficult to arouse. Neurology consulted and recommended Ativan
with the possibility that she may have been seizing. Over the
course of the subsequent hour, she became arousable and followed
commands but remained somnolent and confused.

ROS: She is unable to provide. Per her husband no fevers,
chills, c/o HA, neck pain, cough, sob, cp, palpitations, nausea,
vomitting, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, back pain, rash,
joint swelling or pain, abdominal pain. She ate some breakfast
this morning with his assistance and slept poorly last night,
waking frequently. He does note her BP has been elevated to 160
systolic this past week.

Past Medical History:
1. High-grade large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed
[**10-14**]. She was treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP [**2157-11-2**] through
[**2158-1-17**]. Treatment course complicated by fever and neutropenia.
Supportive care with Neulasta and Aranesp given. PET at the end
of treatment showed no FDG-avid disease. Stem cell mobilization
performed [**2158-2-16**]. Anutologous stem cell transplant with BEAM
chemotherapy was done in [**2158-3-9**].
2. Intra-parenchymal hemorrhage and sub-dural hematoma s/p
evacuation x 4 following fall.
3. Seizure disorder- as above
4. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in [**11-14**]
5. Suprarenal IVC filter placed on [**2158-2-10**] (large infrarenal
IVC clot and thrombosis of left common iliac and left femoral
veins seen at that time)
6. C. difficile colitis [**2-16**] and [**3-15**]
7. Staphylococcus hand infection treated with incision and
drainage and subsequent antibiotics
8. Right toe Staphylococcus infection
9. Hypertension
10. Osteoarthritis
11. Peripheral neuropathy (attributed to her chemotherapy)
12. Tonsillectomy
13. Cholecystectomy
[**65**]. Excision of a benign abdominal tumor
15. Bilateral pulmonary emboli and LLE DVT in [**10-14**]


Social History:

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course:
1. Altered mental status: admitted to ICU for monitoring after
episode of somnolence which improved with Ativan administration.
Neurology followed closely. Patient had EEG which demonstrated
diffuse slowing without seizure activity.  Keppra continued,
Keppra level pending.  Toxic metabolic work up started.  No
evidence of infection.  Plan for 24 hour EEG, MRI/MRA and LP
under fluoroscopic guidance tomorrow.  During ICU course, had
brief periods of calling out initially, but at transfer, no
further episodes of agitation or somnolence for hours.

2. Hip Pain: X-ray negative for fracture

3. Seizure disorder: EEGs as above. Checking Keppra level.
Continued on keppra, lamotrigine and gabapentin

4. Disposition: transferred to neurology service for further
work up. Seen by BMT team, they will follow.

Floor Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred to neurology service and prolonged video
EEG monitoring was initiated. She had several episodes of
screaming and agitation, no EEG correlation for seizure activity
was noted. patient responded well to low doses of Haldol.

on [**2160-3-25**] patient had a prolonged episode in the morning where
she was unresponsive, EEG showed fast activity but lots
superimposed artifacts were noted. She was in a presumed non
convulsive status, Ativan 2mg + 2mg was given and we noticed EEG
changes and clinically the patient improved and became
responsive.

On [**2160-3-26**] Keppra was decreased and the discontinued on
[**2160-3-27**] due to the possibility of contributing for her
behavioral deterioration. lamotrigine was increased on [**2160-3-27**]
300mg twice a day.

Patient had a schedule ventriculostomy with shunt of the
encephalomalacia cavity per neurosurgery. During this admission
this procedure was cancelled and will be re-addressed after
evaluation of her lymphoma stage status.

On [**2160-3-30**] patient presented episode of unresponsiv
