Brief Hospital Course:
DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS:
Ms. [**Known lastname 61799**] was admitted in diabetic ketoacidosis, with a LLL
pneumonia and medication nonadherence as the likely etiology.

drip was transitioned to insulin SQ.  The [**Last Name (un) **] service was
consulted for help with insulin recommendations as well as for

right footand was being followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from vascular

tissue, but given her presentation of DKA, vascular surgery was
consulted to ensure that they did not feel the wound was
infected or required further debridement and treatment. They
felt the wound was properly healing and recommended outpatient
follow-up in clinic.

ASTHMA:
She was on singulair as an outpatient and albuterol prn.  She
was not on an inhaled steroid, despite this being first line
