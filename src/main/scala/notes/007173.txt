Pertinent Results:
Non-Contrast Head CT [**2115-8-8**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study secondary to patient positioning and motion.
Acute-appearing large left subdural hematoma overlying the left
cerebral convexity with associated mass effect including
compression of the left lateral ventricle, 12 mm shift of
normally midline structures, and subfalcine, transtentorial and
uncal herniation. An extra-axial collection overlying the right
cerebral convexity may represent a hyperacute SDH or remote
hemorrhage with several foci of more acute hemorrhage.
2. Endotracheal tube terminates within the right main stem
bronchus and
repositioning is recommended.

Non-Conrast Head CT [**2115-8-9**]:
IMPRESSION: No interval change in the size of the known
bilateral subdural
extraaxial fluid collections. No increase in mass effect.

Non-Contrast Head CT [**2115-8-13**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged bilateral subdural hematomas.
2. Progressively increasing hypodensity in the right thalamus,
likely
representing an evolving acute infarction.

Echocardiogram:The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-2-2**], no
change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female w/ PMHx sig for HTN, recurrent UTIs, who
BIBA after being found unresponsive at home.  She apparently had
foul smelling urine on the day of admission. Prior to admission,
she was reportedly walking normally and was talking though was
slightly confused.  Her daughter brought a urine sample to the
Urologists office in the afternoon, and when she came back home,
her mom was in bed, in a pool of urine with blood around her
mouth.  She was brought to the ED and was found to have a
chronic R SDH and L acute on chronic SDH.  Of note, the patient
had been experiencing chronic hip pain and was taking 2 full
strength aspirin daily, for the last four weeks, as opposed to
her usual one.

On admission to the hospital; she ruled in for MI by elevated
troponin to .59. Cardiology consult was obtained, and
conservative mgmt was recommended given the patient's advanced
age, and poor prognosis given clinical presentation for SDH.
Patient's family(daughter) was told of the patient's poor
prognosis, however opted to observe her for possible progress
for approximately 10 days. During this time, her neurological
examination was stably poor.  Social work and palliative care
was consulted to assist the daughter in the decision making
process. On approximately HD#10, daughter decided to make the
patient DNR/DNI, and patient was extubated the subsequent day.
After an additional family  meeting, daughter agreed to make her
mother [**Name (NI) 3225**], and she subsequently passed on [**2115-8-21**].
