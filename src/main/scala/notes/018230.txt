Brief Hospital Course:
1. GIB: Pt seen by GI who did not want to emergently scope pt
since he was having an NSTEMI. He recieved 1 unit PRBCS in the
ED and another 2 overnight within 12 hrs of his arrival to the
unit. His vitals signs remained stable and Hct bumped
appropriately to the mid 30's after the two units (29.8 -->
34.5). He arrived with a femoral cordis, which later was
displaced, so two periperhal IVs were started. Protonix IV. Q6h
hcts were done, and then decreased to q8 and then q12.
He was called out on the morning of his first hopsital day since
he was stable and was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] on HD #2.
The pt had no further episodes of melena in the hospital and was
entirely asymptomatic. Diet was adv as tolerated, and plan was
for outpt EGD and colonoscopy in 2-3wks. Plavix and beta-blocker
were held in hospital. Transfusion goal was hct>30; pt did not
require further transfusion. After discussion with GI, pt was
discharged on aspirin and on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI (new) prior to the
procedure. Pt was instructed to hold plavix at home until the
colonoscopy.
.
2. NSTEMI: In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EKG showed ST segment depressions and
TWI in the lateral leads which were different from prior EKG.
His troponin was 0.16 in the ED but increased 8 hours later,
along with a rise in his CK and MB. These continued to climb
over the next 24 hours, but plateued by the second hospital day.
Serial EKG's were checked which showed no new change. Cardiology
consult obtained in the ED; decision was to defer intervention
as this was likely demand ischemia, hold plavix since he had
been 1 yr out form his stnet placement. Pt placed on tele with
no events and he never had chest pain or other anginal symptoms.

On the floor, pt had several brief episodes of asymptomatic
bradycardia to 30's with increased ectopy. An EKG showed no
changes.
Echo showed: EF > 60%. No AS, no AR. Mild PA HTN. Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
.
3. ESRD: Renal consult obtained in ED did not find a need for
emergent HD. Pt had HD on ICU day 1. Pt's home HD is Tu/Th/Sat.
.
4. DM: On home regimen with good control.
.
5. Hyperchol. Increased lipitor to 40qd.
.
6. Proph: PPI, OOB
.
7. Pt discharged to home with very close follow-up: PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 2085**], GI
