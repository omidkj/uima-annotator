      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
                                    IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
      SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    SPARSE GROWTH.

CATHETER TIP: no growth (final)
C DIFF: negative
BLOOD CULTURES ([**10-14**]): negative x 2

OF NOTE:
MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE.
CLINICAL HISTORY: Fracture after trauma. Now upper extremity
weakness.
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR images and
axial gradient echo and T2-weighted images were obtained.
FINDINGS:
The study is degraded by patient motion. The C2 fracture shown
on the CT of the same day is again visualized, primarily on the
STIR images. At the level of the base of C2, where the posterior
inferior corner of C2 is displaced slightly into the spinal
canal, there is T2 hyperintensity in the spinal cord dorsally,
suggesting a contusion. Osteophytes are noted at C3-4 level.
There appears to be some edema in C4, where there is an anterior
fusion and metallic artifact from a cage. No fracture was seen
on the CT. There is also metallic artifact from the cage at
C5-6. The disc space osteophyte seen at C6-7 on the CT is
visible.
IMPRESSION:
1. The study is limited by motion, but there appears to be edema
in the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord at the level of the
inferior aspect of C2, suggestive of a spinal cord contusion.
2. The known fracture through the C2 pedicles and the base of C2
is visualized. There is minimal displacement of the fragment
from the posterior inferior aspect of C2 into the canal, but the
CSF around the spinal cord remains patent.
3. The postsurgical and degenerative disc disease changes at
other levels are visualized to some extent.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL
INDICATION: Elevated bilirubin.
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: Limited views of the liver are
unremarkable. There is no evidence of ascites. The gallbladder
is decompressed and the wall is thickened. There is no evidence
of cholelithiasis or pericholecystic fluid. There is no intra or
extrahepatic biliary dilatation and the common bile duct
measures 3 mm. The flow within the portal vein is hepatopetal.
IMPRESSION: Decompressed gallbladder with wall thickening. No
evidence of acute cholecystitis.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2156-10-18**] 11:49 AM
CHEST: Tracheostomy tube is present. The tip of the Dobhoff tube
lies within the second part of the duodenum. The tip of the
central line lies in the region of the junction of the right
atrium and SVC.
Hazy opacity seen in the right lower lobe probably representing
an area of atelectasis. An early infiltrate in this region could
not be excluded. Elsewhere, the lung fields appear clear.
IMPRESSION: Atelectasis or possible pneumonic consolidation,
right lower lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was hemodynamically stable on arrival. He was seen
on arrival in the ED by the Trauma Surgery service and the
Orthopedic Surgery service, and his initial evaluation confirmed
the hangman's type C2 fracture. Although his intiial neurologic
examination was essentially normal, a repeat exam revealed [**5-18**]
strength in the right upper extremity and decreased pinpick
sensat
