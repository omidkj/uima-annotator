History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 106368**] is a 56 year-old right-handed woman with a past
medical
history including refractory epilepsy, s/p right temporal
lobectomy and VNS placement, legal blindness in the setting of
optic nerve degeneration, and recent admission ([**2185-7-30**] to
[**2185-8-2**]) for orthostatic hypotension and breakthrough seizures
who initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] with confusion and
was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] following intubation for further
evaluation and care.
.
According to available records, the patient was driven to a
scheduled doctor's appointment by a friend on the day of
evaluation.  Apparently she was found to be "confused" versus
unresponsive in a wheelchair while in the waiting room.
Accordingly, EMS was called for immediate transport to [**Hospital3 21232**].   There vitals were recorded as t 96.4, hr 61, rr 16,
bp 114/65, O2 sat 100.  Blood glucose was 154.  Examination was
thought to reveal disorientation to date, place, and time.  She
reportedly demonstrated verbal perseveration, repeating "[**Hospital3 **]."  She was noted to be moving all limbs with pupils that
were equal, round, reactive to light.  She was thought to have a
"floppy" neck. Her examination apparently worsened thereafter;
she was thought to become diaphoretic and less responsive to
noxious stimulation with a "poor airway" and depressed gag
reflex.  She was given ativan 2 mg, etomidate, succ, vec, and
intubated at about 10:30 am.  After a non-contrast CT of the
head
was done she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation
and care.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 106368**] is a 56 -year-old right handed woman with intractable
epilepsy status post right temporal lobectomy and vagus nerve
stimulator placement, legally blind, recently admitted with
orthostatic hypotension. She has episodes of head drops,
episodes
of loss of awareness with lipsmacking and rhythmic jerking of
the
left hand and foot followed by tingling sensations in her left
arm, visual hallucinations, and rare secondarily generalized
seizures.

She was recently discharged home and returns to the hospital
because she was noted to be confused at her PCP's office on
Thursday. She was sent to [**Hospital3 2737**] where she was
intubated
for airway protection and sent here to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation. She was extubated the following day, but remained in
the ICU until now further monitoring as she continued to be very
encephalopathic, not opening eyes to painful stimuli.


At the end of her last hospitalization, Tegretol was increased
slightly, but she did not actually take the increased dose as
the
new scripts were apparently found in her purse. the initial CBZ
level was high at 17, likely not a trough level, and repeat
trough level here was in the 8 range.

she has mild leukocytosis upon admission, and due to persistent
lethargy, there was concern for CNS infection. LP showed 1-2
WBCs, ++ RBCs likely due to traumatic tap, with normal glucose
and protein, but RBCs did not clear as significantly as
expected.
leukocytosis now resolved.

Once her mental status improved to baseline she was transferred
to the neuro-med floor.
There was no abnormal events noted. No apparent seizures during
her brief time
on the neuro-med floor. A social worker was consulted to assure
a safe return to home to resume independence. A plan was set for
Mrs [**Known lastname 106368**] which included setting up a [**Known lastname 269**] to visit Mrs [**Known lastname 106368**] on
Thursday. [**Doctor First Name **], whom is Mrs [**Known lastname **] daughter was informed of her
return home and had aggreed to make sure that Mrs [**Known lastname **] was safe
at home and that there was no mistakes with medication
compliance. A review of home medications was done By Mrs
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and a letter indicating her medication names,
doses and directions was made for her reference.
No actue events were noted during this hospitalization.
