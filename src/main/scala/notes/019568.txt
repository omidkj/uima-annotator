Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2187-6-15**] 12:42 AM

Reason: IPH

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with transfer for large IPH

COMPARISON: Outside hospital study not available at time of
dictation.

CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a large 3.3 x 5.7 cm left
parietotemporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extension into
the left lateral ventricle. There is surrounding vasogenic
edema, which causes effacement of adjacent sulci and a small [**4-17**]
mm rightward subfalcine herniation. No other focus of hemorrhage
is seen. Evaluation of the osseous structures is limited by
patient motion. There is no gross osseous abnormality, and the
mastoid air cells and visualized paranasal sinuses appear clear.

IMPRESSION: Large 3.3 x 5.7 cm left parietotemporal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated small subfalcine
midline shift.

[**2187-6-15**] 1030AM NCHCT:
Stable appearance of left parietotemporal hemorrhage compared
with study ten hours prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive nursing needs and
monitoring of neurological status. No significant interventions
were made. Serial CT scans showed some increased edema but no
neurosurgical intervention was made given the patient's explicit
wishes as outlined in her advance directives, the poor
prognosis, her overall signficant co-morbidity. She was made
DNR/DNI. Neurosurgery was also reluctant since data has shown no
benefit from hematoma evacuation. With conservative measures she
had a stable course in the ICU.

After transfer to the floor she developed two episodes of
confusion, treated with seroquel. She did not develop a
pneumonia, but she did develop paroxysmal increased
bloodpressures and her AF occasionally had RVR, warranting the
repeated use of Diltiazem and Metoprolol. She received Lasix on
occasion for congestive heartfaillure. The family was still
deciding what the appropriate goals of care would be, when in
the AM of [**6-19**]/8 she died of cardiac failure. No donations, no
autopsy.
