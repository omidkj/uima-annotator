History of Present Illness:
This 40-year-old right-handed-woman describes gradual decrease
in vision in the left eye since last [**Month (only) 216**] where she noticed
that she  was not able to see the TV out of her left eye and in
the past two weeks she started having central vision loss and
blurred vision in her right eye. She was need by a neuro-
ophthalmologist who ordered an MRI that was performed today.
She was sent to the emergency room from Shields MRI for emergent

evaluation.

On questioning the patient reveals that she started loosing her
sense of smell about five years ago at which time she attributed

to her allergies and was seen by an allergist who told her that
30% of people loose their sense of smell.  She also expresses
that her sense of taste has been off for a number of years.


Past Medical History:
Notable for diabetes diagnosed within the past year.  She also
has asthma and endometriosis.  She was diagnosed with bipolar

vitamin B12 deficiency about a year ago, but is not on any
supplements either.

PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE:

greatly decreased, full strength in all extremities, sensation
intact, ambulatory without assistance.

Pertinent Results:
MRI [**12-14**]
Known large, avidly-enhancing anterior cranial fossa mass
arising
from the olfactory groove and planum sphenoidale, most
compatible with
meningioma, unchanged from the recent routine MR studies.

CT head [**12-15**] post-op
Postoperative changes in the bifrontal lobes with
pneumocephalus, small
parenchymal hemorrhages, and a small subdural along the anterior
falx. There is no shift of the normally midline structures.
Continued followup is recommended.

MRI BRAIN [**12-15**] : IMPRESSION: Status post craniotomies with
removal of the large frontal mass. Blood products are seen in
the region with expected post-surgical changes without acute
infarcts or increase in mass effect or hydrocephalus. Bifrontal
edema is now better appreciated after the removal of the tumor.
No residual enhancing lesion seen. Mild meningeal enhancement is
identified which appears postoperative.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**12-13**] for conventional cerebral angiogram
to assess the vessels surrounding her large frontal lesion as
well as assess the need for embolization of any of the vessels.
She had her maxillary artery embolized during the procedure and
was trasnfered to the ICU post-angio for observation and
management. She remained stable voernight with good peripheral
and femoral pulses in both lower extremtiies. She was taken to
the OR on [**12-14**] for a bifrontal craniotomy for resection of her
lesion. She tolerated the procedure well and was trasnferred to
the ICU intubated post-operatively. She underwent a
post-operative CT scan of the head which showed expected post-op
changes and pneumocephalus. She also had an MRI scan of the
brain which showed no residual lesion and no signs of infarct.
She was extubated late in the morning of [**12-15**] successfully and
was following commands readily.

On [**12-16**] the patient had significant periorbital edema and she
was ordered for Ice packs and teabags to her eyes.  She was
instructed to elevate her HOB as much as possible to dissipate
the edema.
On [**12-17**] her swelling was slightly improved, but otherwise
neurologically stable. She stated that the vision in her left
eye was improving. She was noted to have increased urine output.
This was closely monitored. All Labs (serum and urine) remained
WNL x24hrs. U/O was thought to be due to mobilization of fluids
and increased PO intake.
On [**12-18**] she was again stable. PT cleared the patient for
discharge but recommended evaluation by OT. Decadron was
decreased to 2mg Q6hrs.
On [**12-19**] the swelling was significantly better and her vision was
stable. Her decadron wean was ordered to off over 7 days. She
was seen by OT who recommended home with services and
supervision.
At this time she was cleared for discharge home but it was too
late to set up services so she was kept overnight.

On [**12-20**] her pain is well controlled, she is tolerating PO and is
ambulating independently. OT felt she required 24 hour
supervision at home which her family is not able to provide.
Given this she was screened for a rehab facility placement. She
was given a rehab bed and discharged there on the afternoon of
[**12-20**] with instructions for follow-up.
