History of Present Illness:
This is a 57 year old white female with known moderate to severe
mitral regurgitation who presented to [**Hospital6 **]
complaining of a cold with fever and short of breath.  She had
started to have some difficulty when she laid down at night over
the previous 3 weeks.  This has progressively worsened over last
few days and she noted that she had developed a fever. In the ED
at [**Hospital1 **] a CXR showed bilateral infiltrates with bilateral
pleural effusions, EKG showed a LBBB.  Saturations in ED were
down to 89%.  Initially she was placed on a non rebreather and
subsequetly was intubated for increasing work of breathing.
Blood cultures x2 were drawn and patient given 1 gram Vancomycin
given at [**2102**] hours the day of transfer.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 57 year old white female a history of moderate/severe
mitral valve prolapse presented to an outside hospital with
dyspnea. She was intubated for respiratory distress. On echo she
was found to have wide open mitral valve regurgitation with an
EF of 50%. She was transferred to the CCU at [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care. Echo showed worsened mitral valve regurgitation. She
underwent a cardiac cath which revealed no evidence of coronary
disease along with right and left heart failure and pulmonary
hypertension. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema likely
secondary to MR resulting in dyspnea/respiratory distress. An
IABP was placed for afterload reduction in conjunction with
Lasix diuresis. A Swan Ganz catheter was also placed to assess
hemodynamics but was discontinued in the ICU. She was initially
on Vancomycin for possible endocarditis but this was
discontinued after echo showed no endocarditis. Culture data at
both [**Hospital1 18**] and [**Hospital1 **] was negative. She was brought to the
Operating Room on [**2-3**] where she underwent mitral valve
replacement and atrial septal defect closure. Please see
operative report for surgical details.

Her bypass time was 94 minutes with a crossclamp time of 73
minutes,
She tolerated the operation well and weaned from bypass on
Epinephrine, Propofol and Neo Synephrine infusions.  She was
transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU,
in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Pressors
were weaned off on post-op day one her IABP and chest tubes were
removed. On postop day two she continued to be doing well and
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further care and
advancement of physical activity.

Epicardial pacing wires and Foley were removed per protocol. She
worked with Physical Therapy to increase her strength and
mobility. She was anticoagulated for her mechanical mitral
valve. The remainder of her hospital course was uneventful.
She wa snoted to have a right foot drop and complained of mild
paresthesias on POD 3. A splint was ordered and she continued to
progress with her activity.

A neurology consult was obtained and a MRI of the lumbar soine
was unremarkable.  She felt that the strength was improving and
the weakness was felt to be dur to local nerve trauma from
catheterization and/or the IABP.

Heparin was begun on POD 3 as Coumadin was adjusted.  When the
INR was 2.4 the Heparin was stopped.  Arrangements were made for
the [**Hospital1 **] Heart Center [**Hospital 108021**] Clinic to follow her
Coumadin dosing, with a target INR of 2.5-3.5.

Out patient PT will be continued. As she has no cardiologist,
her primary care doctor will refer her to one for long term
follow up.Medications, precautions and follow up were discussed
prior to her discharge.
