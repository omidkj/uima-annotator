CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**2159-7-14**]):
1. No acute intra-abdominal process with no evidence of colitis
or enteritis.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Bladder wall thickening, a relatively collapsed bladder that
could
represent chronic inflammation/neurogenic bladder.
4. Two prominent mesenteric lymph nodes as detailed above, one
immediately
adjacent to the third portion of the duodenum and that other, a
celiac axis lymph node that had been slowly growing since remote
examinations since [**2153**].  These are more fully characterized on
concurrent recent MR from [**2158-12-19**], and please refer to MR
report for further details and recommendations .

CXR:
IMPRESSION: Diffuse interstitial and patchy airspace opacities,
most
pronounced in the lung bases. Findings are concerning for an
infectious
process. Mild element of superimposed edema is not excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 66 yo Aramaic-speaking man with history of
vascular dementia, gastric carcinoid tumor, hypertension, and
ptsd who presents from [**Hospital1 1501**] today with fever and hematochezia.
.
# GI bleed: Per report, patient had episode of loose stool at
[**Hospital1 1501**] today with small amount of [**Hospital1 **]. NGL was performed with
some initial pink fluid that cleared after 250cc. Pt does have
history of gastritis. Relatively normal BUN, however, is less
consistent with upper GI bleed. More likely source is lower GI
bleed, given history of AVMs of the cecum and internal
hemrroids. The patient was initially admitted to the ICU and
remained hemodynamically stable thoughout his entire admission.
His Hct remained stable 27-32 with no further evidence of active
bleeding. The patient was evaluated by GI and given his stable
Hct, no further evidence of active bleeding and fever they
recommended outpatient colonoscopy. He was called out to the
floor and Hct continued to remain stable.  The patient was
discharged on omeprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **] to be continued until he
follows up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2643**] on [**2159-8-1**].  The patient should
have outpatient EGD/colonoscopy per the inpatient GI team.
.
# Fever: The patient was found to have a temperature of 100.4.
He had a CXR performed that showed possible opacities at the
bases concerning for pneumonia.  He also had a urine culture
that grew back E
