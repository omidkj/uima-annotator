Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14037**]
Chief Complaint:
txf from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with shock liver, rhabdo, ARF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right IJ placement


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, 57M hx of Schizoaffective d/o, EtOH abuse admitted to
ICU with acute hepatitis. Day PTA, patient had gone to [**Hospital1 112**] after
falling down 5 days prior, found to have rib fx and d/c on pain
meds. At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, reported rib pain had worsened.
.
Here, CTA was negative for PE, fx, or dissection. Found to have
serum EtOH of 26 but reported no alcohol consumption in 3 days.
Labs remarkable for AG of 33, lactate of 6.2, ALT 9900/AST 4049,
and CK 6000+. Started on sepsis protocol and received 2L of NS,
Vanco/Azithro/Ceftriaxone, and percocet for pain. Pt was never
hypotensive and lactate decreased to 1.8. Pt denied med changes,
no herbals. Denied recent tylenol use.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], liver was consulted. They recommended 17 doses
Mucomyst. Liver enzymes trended down. CK peaked at 12k and also
trended down. Went into ARF with peak Cr 3.3, improved to 3.1 on
transfer. Received aggressive IV fluid hydration. Patient
without fever or leukocytosis or focal complaints other than rib
pain. Utox negative.
.
On transfer to the floor, patient was feeling well, only
complaining of persistent left rib pain upon inspiration. Was
making good urine. Denied HA, N/V, muscle pain, joint pains,
abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills,
or other concerning sign/symptoms.


Past Medical History:
Schizoaffective disorder.
Hypertension.
Bright red blood per rectum (occurred 6-7 years ago with
previous sigmoidoscopy with hemorrhoids).
Syphilis (treated).
Alcohol abuse since age 8.
NIDDM diagnosed [**2187**].
Dementia, likely alcohol related.
Pancreatitis.
Periodic homelessness.
Thrombocytopenia.
Status post removal of submandibular cyst.
Denies history of withdrawal or DT's.


Social History:
Positive ETOH use since age 8. The patient
goes through phases of dependence followed by non-use.Illicit
drugs, used many in the past but no current IV drug abuse and no

previous IV drug abuse. Tobacco, 5 cigs per day for the last 40

years.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: 90 SR, nl axis, nl intervals, no st changes.
.
CT Head [**2-18**]: no intracranial hemorrhage, gross brain atrophy
and a
few lacunar infarcts.
.
CXR [**2-18**]: NO acute process.
.
RUQ U/S:
1. Diffusely echogenic liver compatible with fatty liver. Other
forms of liver disease and more serious forms of liver disease
cannot be excluded on the basis of this study.
2. Layering gallstones in gallbladder, without evidence of acute

cholecystitis.
3. Subcapsular free fluid in the right kidney upper pole, of
uncertain clinical significance. Renal cysts.
.
CTA chest [**2-18**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or dissection.
2. Fatty liver.
3. Changes of CABG....?? (no hx of CABG)
4. Emphysematous changes of the lungs.
5. Right anterior inferior neck asymmetry
.
CXR [**2-23**]:
1.  Right lower lobe posterior basilar segment consolidation
concerning for pneumonia.  Questionable subtle consolidation in
the left lower lobe
posteriorly, raising the possibility of an aspiration pneumonia.

2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
Echo [**2-25**]:
1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is
mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2-25**]:
Mild improvement has occurred in interstitial infiltration in
the right lung. More radiodense perihilar consolidation on the
left is unchanged.  Heart size is normal, and there is no
appreciable mediastinal venous engorgement, although there is a
new small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.  While the time
course of changing in the lungs, onset over three days, severe
worsening over 24 hours and then subsequent improvement,
consistent with pulmonary edema, the asymmetry and severe
perihilar consolidation on the left suggest other explanations
such as asymmetric edema and pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage or
aspiration.
.
CXR [**2-28**]:
Improving asymmetrical alveolar and ground-glass opacities.
Differential diagnoses include multifocal pneumonia and
asymmetrical pulmonary edema.
.
Chest CT [**3-2**]:
1.  Acute interstitial pulmonary abnormality, improving compared
to the prior chest radiographs, differential diagnosis includes
pulmonary hemorrhage, interstitial (viral) pneumonia and drug
reaction.
2.  Moderate left pleural effusion.
3.  Gall stones without cholecystitis.
.
Hip X-ray [**3-2**]:
No hardware identified.  There are no radiopaque foreign bodies
in the pelvis.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57M Schizoaffective d/o, EtOH abuse admitted to ICU with
acute hepatitis of unclear etiology, ARF, rhabdomyolysis
.
# Acute Hepatitis: AST and ALT were elevated to 4100 and 9900
respectively on admission.  The liver team was consulted.  The
most likely etiology is shock liver though pt has no documented
hypotension and would expect that if he was hypotensive, he
would have been in renal failure on admission as well but his
creatinine was normal.  His lactate was also elevated to 6.2
indicating evidence of organ ischemia.  RUQ ultrasound showed no
evidence of budd chiari and changes consistent with fatty liver.
Hepatitis panel was negative along with CMV, EBV, ceruloplasmin
and anti-smooth muscle antibody.  Tylenol toxicity is also a
possibility due to the fact that pt was given percocet on d/c
from [**Hospital1 756**] ED and could have taken too much but on arrival
tylenol was negative. Pt was given 17 doses of mucomyst over
several days and monitored closely in the ICU.  His LFTs had
peaked on admission, trended down and were normal within one
week.
.
# Rhabdomyolysis: On admission, pt's CK was found to be 6800
with evidence of myoglobinuria.  Troponin was negative.  Again,
the etiology of his rhabdo remains unclear.  Pt presented with a
rib fracture and could have been down for longer than
