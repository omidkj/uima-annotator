Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis [**6-15**]


History of Present Illness:
67 yo male with CAD s/p CABG, CHF EF 20%, HTN, DM2, h/o UTI, h/o
CoNS bacteremia, ? HIT, s/p trach/peg ([**5-3**]) presents as
transfer from [**Hospital 8**] hospital with shock. Patient was
recently discharged from [**Hospital 8**] hospital on [**5-25**] with flash
pulmonary edema and was discharge to [**Hospital3 **]. He
represented to [**Hospital1 8**] on [**6-3**] with signs of hypovolemic
shock. On the evening prior to admission, patient had an episode
of flash pulmonary edema and was given 80 mg IV lasix, with
perihilar infiltrates on Xray which resolved after diuresis. The
following day he was found to be lethargic and was found to he
hypotensive to 66/42. H was given 250 cc of fluid and
transferred to the [**Hospital1 8**] ED with a BP 80s/40s prior to
transfer.
.
At [**Hospital1 8**], patient was noted to be febrile to 103.2 on [**6-4**].
He was felt at the time to have sepsis [**1-26**] to pneumonia with
sputum growing GNR and pseudomonas. He was treated with
[**Last Name (un) **]/Cipro/Vanco adjust to renal function. He was treated with
levophed and dopamine for MAPs 65. Cr was noted to be 1.9 from a
baseline of 1.1 which was felt to be [**1-26**] contraction in the
setting of diuresis and hypotension. Total I/Os for LOS was
1.89/590. Patient was also noted to develop LLE edema. Plan was
for patient to have LENI performed, but this was not done prior
to transfer. INR on admission was noted to be 2, but trended
down to 1.6. Plan was for patient to be started on lepeirudin,
but this was not initiated prior to transfer. In regards to DM,
home dose of lantus 20 U were continued.
.
In the ICU, patient is on mechanical ventilation through a
trach. He appears comfortable at this time.
.
Review of sytems:
Limited due to patient on mechanical ventilation.
