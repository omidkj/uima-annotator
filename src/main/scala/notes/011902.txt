Chest x-ray - [**2157-2-6**] - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous
radiograph, the size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
Also unchanged are the relatively low lung volumes.  There is no
evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia,
no pneumothorax, and no signs indicative of overhydration.
Minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinuses suggests minimal
pre-existing pleural effusions. The pacemaker leads are in
unchanged position.
.
[**2157-2-7**] - ECHO: - The left atrium and right atrium are normal
in cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate to
severe global hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. A well-seated bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present with normal gradient. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is at least mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
dilated cavity and global hypokinesis. Normal aorticc valve
bioprosthetic gradient with mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. At least mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
.
EKG - Atrial and ventricular pacing. Compared to the previous
tracing there is no significant change.
.
Cardiac catherization - COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed:

--the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the LAD was totally occluded after D1.
--the LCX had diffuse distal disease 50-60%, unchanged from
before.  The
OM and LCX stents were patent.  OM2 had a jailed origin 80%
stenosis.
--the RCA was known occluded and not injected.
2.  Venous conduit angiography revealed the SVG-OM graft
occluded at its
origin.  The SVG-LAD graft was patent.
3.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial

systolic hypertension, with SBP 149 mmHg.
4. Successful PTCA of the OM2 origin using a 2.5x12mm Quantum
Maverick
balloon.  Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent
dissection,
and a less than 20% residual stenosis.  (See PTCA comments.)
5. The right femoral arteriotomy was successfully closed using a
Mynx
device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG-LAD graft, occluded SVG-OM graft.
2. Mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
3. PTCA of the OM2 origin was performed.


Brief Hospital Course:
86-y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG, s/p PCI to LCx ([**2154**]), s/p
bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, systolic CHF s/p
biventricular ICD who presented with stuttering chest pain that
resolved. Cardiac enzymes were negative. Patient underwent
cardiac catherization and had stent placed in the OM1.
.
#. Chest Pain - The pt has a significant history of CAD with
previous CABG and PCI to LCx and OM in [**2154**]. The pt presented
with 1 hour history of mid-sternal, band-like chest pain not
relieved by ntg. No associated symptoms, no clear precipitating
event. Cardiac enzymes were negative x3. No clear ECG changes
however the pt is paced with LBBB morphology on ECG.
Presentation concerning for unstable angina given long cardiac
history but notably with absense of ECG and CE changes. Patient
was admitted for cardiac catherization which was delayed
secondary to elevated INR. Once INR was < 1.8 patient was taken
to cardiac catherization which demonstrated Cath obstructed OM1
which was balooned as well as distal LAD and RCA complete
obstructions that were not intervened upon.  Patient was started
on IV heparin drip and nitro drips. IV heparin was discontinued
after the patient had 3 sets of negative enzymes. Patient was
continued on Beta blocker, aspirin. Initially prior to cardiac
catherization patient was placed on plavix 75 mg PO daily
however this medication was discontinued prior to discharge.
Cardiac catherization demonstrated three vessel coronary artery
disease, patent SVG-LAD graft, occluded SVG-OM graft, mild
systemic arterial systolic hypertension. Patient had PTCA of the
OM2 origin was performed.  As patient with extensive coronary
artery history and also with markedly elevated LDL patient was
started on statin.  Given that already on amiodarone as
outpatient started atorvastatin 20 mg PO daily.
.
#. Systolic Heart Failure - pt with report of severe CHF, BiV
ICD placed [**12-24**]. EF On exam patient appeared euvolemic. ECHO
showed EF 25%, mild symmetric
