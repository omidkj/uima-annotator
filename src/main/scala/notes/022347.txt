History of Present Illness:
65 yo woman with a h/o HTN, CVA in [**2116**] unknown deficit,

IMAGING:
CT Head [**2121-2-3**]: No acute intracranial abnormality present.
Chronic changes.
.
CTA Head [**2121-2-3**]:
1). Stable head CT without acute findings.
2). Grossly stable appearance of the 5 x 5 mm wide necked
internal carotid rtery aneurysm arising at the origin of the
posterior communicating artery. There are irregular outpouchings
arising from the aneurysm sac.
3). 3 mm anteriorly oriented aneurysm arising from the M1
segment of the left middle cerebral artery near the origin of
the anterior temporal branch.
4). 2 mm posteriorly oriented basilar tip aneurysm.
.
CTA Torso [**2121-2-6**] for flank pain
1. No pulmonary embolism, no acute aortic pathology.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with compressive
atelectasis. The presence of pneumonia cannot be entirely
excluded.
3. No evidence for retroperitoneal hemorrhage. There is a small
amount of simple fluid within the pelvis.
4. Mild body wall edema. Apical septal thickening. Findings are
suggestive of volume overload.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2121-2-6**] to assess for interval change
1. New right parietal infarct following PCommA coiling.
2. Chronic microvascular disease and lacunar infarct.
.
CTA Head [**2121-2-7**] To assess for interval change:
S/P PComm A coiling without vasospasm. R PCA appears patent
without thrombus. Unchanged 18-mm R PCA infarct is likely
embolic. Stable 4-mm L M1 and 2-mm tip of basiliar aneurysms.
.
[**2121-2-4**] ECHO: Mildly dilated LA. No ASD noted. There is mild
symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Regional LV wall motion
is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is a moderate
resting LV outflow tract obstruction. A mid-cavitary gradient is
identified. NO VSD. RV chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no systolic anterior
motion of the mitral valve leaflets seen. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2113-3-3**], the LVEF is now hyperdynamic with LVOT
obstruction present.
.
EKG: Normal axis. HR 70s. ST depressions V2-V3. p wave
inversions V1-V2, T wave inversion V5-V6.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course:
65 yo woman with a h/o poorly controlled HTN (SBP 170 at home),
CVA in [**2116**] with residual L sided weakness, migraine HA presents
[**2121-2-3**] with severe headache x 2 weeks. LP showed blood but no
evidence of meningitis. CT head was done and was negative for
any vascular anomaly or trauma. A CTA head was then done which
showed a right ICA aneurysm measuring 5x5 mm; 3 mm aneurysm at
the left middle cerebral artery; 2 mm basilar tip aneursym. On
[**2121-2-4**], she underwent Rigth ICA aneurysm coiling by
neurosurgery.  In the ICU, pt had chest pain with ST depression
on EKG and cardiology was consulted. Cardiology felt chest pain
was due to demand ischemia from hypovolemia and recommended beta
blocker and volume repletion. Cardiac enzymes negative. ECHO
[**2121-2-4**] done with results above. On [**2121-2-6**], she underwent CT
torso for flank pain and persistent hypercapnea with results
above. She was placed on BiPAP intermittently in the ICU. Head
imaging [**2121-2-7**
