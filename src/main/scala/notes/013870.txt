History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 76536**] is a 48yo M with h/o AIDS, Hep C, prior h/o UGIB
(esophageal tear per OSH records) who initially presented to
[**Hospital3 **] ED on [**12-27**] with hematemesis and UGIB. By OSH
HPI, pt vomited blood x5, ~1 hr after snorting heroin. He was
originally hypotensive (though BP there was recorded as 119/78),
but his BP responded to IVF. His Hct was 35. NG lavage at that
time showed BRB that did not clear. He was transferred to the
ICU and his rpt Hct came back at 26. He was given several units
of pRBC overnight. He had a L subclavian placed for better
access. EGD was performed on [**12-28**] that showed a large amount of
blood in the stomach and clot was visualized on the gastric side
of the GE junction. During the exam, he developed active
bleeding at the site of clot. Attempts were made at cauterizing
the bleeding, but the pt became agitated and was thus intubated
for airway protection. EGD was continued and the site of active
bleeding was again injected with epinephrine and BICAP
coagulation was performed with achievement of hemostasis.
Approximately 12h after first EGD at OSH, EGD was repeated for
"brisk rebleeding." At that time, the ulcer at GE junction was
visiualized w/ clot, but without active bleeding; his duodenum
was clear. The ulcer was again treated with epinephrine and
BICAP. There was concern for perforation given the depth of
BICAP cauterization. He was continued on protonix IV bid,
octreotide gtt, and ancef (for prophylaxis). The decision was
transferred here to the SICU on [**12-28**] under thoracics care for
possible need of surgical intervention.
Other notable information from the OSH:
- he required a total of 7units prbcs and 2 units FFP prior to
transfer; Hct prior to transfer was 30
- post EGD/intubation, he had multiple episodes of jerking of
shoulders, neck, upper extremities; it was unclear if it was
myoclonus vs. seizure so pt was started on ativan gtt.
- admission labs at the OSH were notable for WBC 2.6, Hct 35.5
(but it trended down to 26.4 w/in 3 hrs), plt 90, Cr 1.0, BUN
10, K 3.3, ALT 58, AST 63, tbili 0.5, alb 3.8. PT 10.6, PTT
28.7, INR 1.0. EtOH level was negative. He was initially
afebrile.
.
In the SICU here, his temperature was 103.1. His Hct was
monitored [**Hospital1 **] and he remained stable. He had coffee ground ouput
(~125cc) from his NGT initially and then it became bilious; he
also had black liquid stool via rectal tube (~150cc). He
remained intubated and sedated. He was on an ativan gtt,
fentanyl gtt and propofol gtt. A PPD was placed on [**12-29**]. After
evaluation by thoracics, no surgical intervention was felt to be
indicated and he was transferred to the MICU service on [**12-29**]
for further management. Hct remained stable at 27-29. He was
also seen by the GI service who felt that no further
intervention was indicated at this time given his high risk of
rebleed. Differential for his ulcer included HIV ulcer, CMV/HSV,
GERD, neoplasia, MW tear, impaction, pill induced.
Recommendations were for IV protonix [**Hospital1 **] and to advance his diet
as tolerated to clears. Plan is for repeat EGD in [**4-16**] weeks for
biopsy of the ulcer.
.
At the time of transfer to our MICU service his hematocrit
remained stable and he was also hemodynamically stable. He has
not required any further blood products at [**Hospital1 18**]. His Tmax today
was 100.8. He was extubated in the AM on [**12-30**] and was able to
maintain stable O2 sats. His mental status remained lethargic.
He is able to follow commands but is unable to provide any
additional history. He states that he was otherwise free of
symptoms, including fever, chills, NS, weight loss, vision
changes, headaches, LH, chest pain, SOB, cough, n/v, diarrhea,
or urinary symptoms. It is unclear if pt actually understands or
is accurately answering these questions.

CXR:IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:
Lungs clear. Heart size normal. No pleural abnormality or
mediastinal widening. ET tube tip at the thoracic inlet is in
standard placement, and left subclavian line tip projects over
the left brachiocephalic vein. Nasogastric tube passes into the
stomach and out of view.
.
CXR:HISTORY: HIV, upper GI bleed, extubation.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-28**]:
NG tube ends in the stomach. Endotracheal tube has been removed.
Left subclavian line ends in the brachiocephalic vein.
Opacification of the right lung base is probably atelectasis,
but should be evaluated clinically for possible aspiration. Left
lung clear. Heart size normal.
.
EKG:Sinus rhythm. Low limb lead QRS voltage, is non-specific and
could be normal
variant. Tracing is otherwise, within normal limits. No previous
tracing
available for comparison.
.
CXR:IMPRESSION: Very subtle ill-defined opacity right infrahilar
region could represent early developing pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:

# Upper gastrointestinal bleed: This was found to be secondary
to an ulcer at the gastro-esophageal junction. At the time of
