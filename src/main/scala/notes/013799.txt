presentation [**2121-4-29**] for sore throat. Of note, he has also had
increasing dysphagia and weight loss of 40lbs over the last
several months. Since then, he was admitted for expedited workup
[**Date range (3) 76745**] of a neck mass thought to be thyroid CA.

He presented this am for endoscopic ultrasound for w/u of this
mass and was noted by GI to be stridorous. Anaesthesia was
called who was concerned about the pts airway and the pt was
referred to the ED. In the ED, he was noted to be stridorous
which per his report this has been worstening over the past 3
days. IP was called and took him to the OR this evening. They
performed repeated dilations of the trachea with a rigid bronch
and placed a 6cm tracheal stent which is 18mm in diameter. It
was also noted that the right vocal chord was paralyzed. Tumor
was noted to be eroding into his airway. He was extubated post
procedure and brought to the ICU.

Studies:

Possible narrowing of the trachea at the cervical level.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old male with h/o HTN and asthma
who was admitted to the MICU for stridor due to a large mass
compressing his airway which required a tracheal stent
placement.
.
#. Stridor due to tracheal mass: His breathing significantly
improved after tracheal stent placement by IP on admission.
Several bronchoscopies with biopsies and an EGD with biopsies
were performed for further characterization of the mass, but a
final diagnosis was not available at time of discharge.
Flexible bronchoscopy on the AM of [**6-23**] (3 days after placement)
found that the stent had migrated lower and was pulled up to the
cricoid cartilage.  Repeat biopsies of mass were taken at that
time and another flex bronch on [**6-25**] revealed no migration of
his stent and no further intervention was performed. Endoscopy
with biopsy was performed on [**6-26**] and significant for
non-obstructive mass visualized in middle third of esophagus.
He will likely get radiation to his mass as an outpatient, but
there was no indication for emergent XRT as an inpatient per the
rad/onc consult obtained.  He was written for Mucomyst nebs q6h
and Duonebs q6h but the patient often refused them.  He would
also often refuse chest PT.  An outpatient steroid taper with
prednisolone prescribed for asthma was continued and completed
on [**6-25**].  If the patient were to become unstable from a
respiratory standpoint and require intubation, it would likely
need to be done fiberoptically with a size 6 ETT along with
Heliox.  The final pathology of his tumor will be followed up at
his outpatient oncology appointments.
.
#. Low-grade Fever: Continued to have low grade temperatures
daily most likely due to underlying tumor. CXR showed no
evidence of infection.  He did have a leukocytosis but it
improved without antibiotic treatment. A UA and urine culture
was negative.
.
#. HTN: Continued on his home HCTZ and lisinopril with holding
parameters.
.
#. Asthma: Continued albuterol/ipratropium nebs as above.  He
had been on a prednisolone taper at home since [**6-2**] for a
possible asthma exacerbation which was continued and ended on
[**6-25**].
.
#. Stage IV CKD.  His creatinine remained slightly below his
previous baseline of 1.9-2.2.
.
#. Communication: Patient and wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76746**] (home),
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 76747**] (cell)
.
#. Code: Full (discussed with HCP in MICU)
