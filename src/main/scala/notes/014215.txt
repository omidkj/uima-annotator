History of Present Illness:
60 yo M w/ hx of CAD, PVD, ESRD on HD who presents with
hypotension at HD and chronic diarrhea of [**Last Name (un) 5487**] etiology.
Patient receives most of his care at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 805**] in
[**Hospital1 789**], RI and has multiple physicians. Patient has been
chronically ill, and has had multiple hospital stays at RW and
rehab centers in RI, most recently for pelvis and femur
fractures, complicated by severe PNA.
Patient reports history of chronic diarrhea for > 1 year and
enormous weight loss (60 lbs in 1 year). Started gradually, had
approximately [**2-6**] BMs daily (green, liquidy, non-bloody). No
associated abdominal pain. Has diarrhea with and without food,
but is exacerbated with meals. Has tried restricting lactose w/o
effect. Family reports no assessment for celiac sprue. Has been
followed by GI physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 84853**], and has reportedly
extensive work-up including endoscopies, and colonoscopies with
biopsies. Per family, no evidence of colonic masses or GI tract
cancers noted. Pt denies dysphagia, but has lost appetite
recently. Reports negative C. difficile and VRE testing in the
past few weeks. Has not tried pancreatic enzymes.
Today, patient was at HD when RN there noticed patient looked
ill, malnourished, and dehydrated. SBPs dropped to 70 systolic
during HD. Patient was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation. Patient
admits to chronic cough with worsening sputum production. Denied
dysuria.

CT ABD/PEL - [**9-18**]
1. Findings suggestive of pulmonary edema at the visualized lung
bases.
2. Right basilar bronchovascular opacity (15 mm) which could be
attributed to atelectasis or a lung nodule, although infection
cannot be excluded. Follow-up chest CT within three months is
recommended to evaluate further as a true lung nodule is not
excluded.
3. Pancreatic atrophy and calcifications consistent with chronic

pancreatitis.
4. Moderate gallbladder distention which can be seen in a
fasting state.
However, if there is clinical concern for a source of acute
infection, an
ultrasound could be considered as well as correlation with
pertinent
laboratory data.
5. Extensive vascular calcifications including stents along the
left common and external iliac arteries whose patency cannot be
assessed on this study.
6. Mild dilatation of the proximal small bowel, borderline in
caliber with
lack of distal passage of contrast. However, the appearance is
felt more
likely to reflect a mild ileus than obstruction, noting no sharp
transition. However, if there is continuing clinical concern for
obstruction, follow-up radiographs could be performed.
7. Considerable stool throughout the colon, which is mildly
distended, also suggestive of slow motility. The lower sigmoid
and rectal walls show mild thickening, which is seen in a more
patchy fashion elsewhere as well. This appearance could be seen
with anasarca in the setting of renal disease, although mild
colitis is difficult to exclude. The patient could be considered
at high risk for ischemic colitis given the history of diarrhea
and severe vascular disease, although usually associated CT
findings would be least prominent in the rectum.
8. Small amount of low-density ascites, which is nonspecific
with
splenomegaly.
.
CXR [**9-17**]
1. Findings are most consistent with moderate pulmonary edema,
with moderate cardiomegaly. However, underlying infection is not
excluded, and evaluation for such may be performed after
appropriate diuresis.
2. Dilated loops of bowel are incompletely assessed. Recommend
dedicated
abdominal radiographs for more complete assessment.
.
EKG [**9-17**]
Sinus rhythm. Diffuse T wave flattening makes the Q-T interval
difficult to interpret. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
CTA chest [**9-25**]:
FINDINGS:
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism till the level of
subsegmental
pulmonary arteries bilaterally. The pulmonary arteries are
normal in diameter as well as the aorta. Extensive coronary
calcifications and coronary stents are noted with a coronary
stent being seen in LAD and right coronary artery at least.
Heart size is enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion. Small
left pleural effusion is noted with no evidence of right pleural
effusion.

The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates the NG tube
tip being in the stomach and otherwise is unremarkable within
the limitations of this study that was not designed for
evaluation of intra-abdominal pathology.

Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy involves the entire
mediastinum and
ranges up to 7.5 mm in the right upper paratracheal area, 12 mm
in right lower paratracheal area, 1 cm in the prevascular area,
8.5 mm in aortopulmonic window, 2 cm in subcarinal and
paraesophageal area with bilateral hilar lymph nodes ranging up
to 1.5 cm. This lymphadenopathy might be reactive to the
extensive parenchymal abnormality demonstrated throughout the
lungs and mostly consisting of two types of findings: Bilateral
peribronchovascular opacities
as well as confluent areas of ground-glass in the upper lungs,
3:14, with
focal areas of ground-glass mostly located in the posterior
segment of right upper lobe, 3:14, 15, 16, 18. The lo
