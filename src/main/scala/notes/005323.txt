Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
asystolic arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right chest tube

History of Present Illness:
64 yo female with history of COPD/ respiratory failure s/p
trach, ruptured diverticula s/p surgical repair [**1-20**] who is
normally followed at [**Hospital1 2177**] who was found at [**Hospital3 672**] today
looking cyanotic in asystole.  She was given epi and atropine
down her trach leading to a perfusing rhythm.  En route she
began flexor/ extensor posturing which continued upon arrival in
the ED as well as constant upward gaze.
.
Neurology evaluated the patient in the ED and found bilateral
flexor posturing of the arms and bilateral extensor posturing in
addition to lack of brainstem reflexes.  Their impression was
likely anoxic brain injury, however versed had been administered
and pupillary reactions could be paralyzed by the atroping given
during the arrest.
.
In the ED, saturations were in the high 90's on the vent, with
HR to the 150's and SBP to 230's.  Diltiazem IV (not gtt) was
given for HR with good control in the ED.  Given
vanco/levo/flagyl for possible infection given elevated WBC to
52.0.


Past Medical History:
Respiratory failure
COPD steroid dependent
Perforated sigmoid colon s/p resection and colostomy
Recent bacteremia [**3-19**] line infection and diverticulitis

MRSA in nares
anxiety
depression
HTN

.
Recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2177**], she presented with fall and
weakness, found to be in a fib with AVR, converted to sinus
rhythm.  Had fever to 103.8, elevated WBC and + blood cultures.
abd CT with free air and to OR for ex-lap with sigmoid
colectomy, [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] procedure. post-op she could not be weaned
off the vent and underwent trach and PEG tube on [**2128-2-5**]. she
was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on vanco due to her + blood
cultures and MRSA history.

acute
intra-abdominal pathology.
2.  Status post partial colectomy and colostomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Asystolic arrest: most likely [**3-19**] hypoxia from PTX in the
setting of infection and small subsegmental PE.
.
#PTX- Evident on CT and pt w/elevated peak pressures despite
trache.
- Thoracic surgery consulted for chest tube placement. placed
chest tube in right chest in ICU [**2128-3-19**]. removed CT on [**2128-3-22**].
repeat CXR shows no PTX on right. transitioned to previous vent
settings and doing well/ stabilized.
.
#Small subsegmental PE and anticoagulation: She was started on
heparin on HD 1, and then transitioned to coumadin and lovenox.
At this same time, she experienced a HCT drop from 25 to 19 in
the setting of receiving 2L of NS.  She was guiaic negative at
the time, however her CXR showed a new left sided pleural
effusion.  A CT of her chest did not show a large hemothorax and
her LE dopplers were negative for clot.  With these in mind, she
was restarted on coumadin and lovenox and her hematocrit
remained stable over the day.
.
#elevated WBC- probable VAP w as well as UTI (U/A positive
however Urine culture negative); CT abdomen (-) [**2128-3-20**] for acute
intraabdominal pathology. Sputum culture grew acinetobacter
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 36**] to Gentamicin and MSSA.  However since the
patient is MRSA + in her nares, we will continue Vancomycin and
Gentamicin for 5 more days post discharge.
- c diff negative x 3
.
# abdominal pain and obstipation- recent colectomy for ruptured
diverticulae, w/o output from end colostomy since admission-
concerning for torsion of bowel. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis
[**2128-3-20**] showed no acute intraabdominal pathology. However, it did
show distended stomach- g tube placed on gravity per thoracics
recs without improvement in sx.
- surgery consulted: recommend bowel regimen with colace,
mineral oil;
- TF restarted without problem
- aggressive bowel regimen
- guiaic negative stool in colostomy
.
#Poor mental status- improved over hospitalization- thought at
first to be anoxic brain injury. head CT negative for acute
bleed. neuro exam on arrival to ICU was withdrawing to painful
stimuli and minimal corneal and gag reflexes.
per neuro recs- no need for LP at this time
- EEG showed slow and disorganized background, as well as the
bursts of generalized delta slowing; mild-moderate
encephalopathy, which may be seen with infections, toxic
metabolic abnormalities, medication effect or ischemia
.
COPD: continue nebs, decrease steroids to 5 q day; goal CO2 on
vent:50-70.
.
Psych meds: restart xanax and seroquel
- seroquel made patient extremely sleepy overnight, with BP in
80's
- decreased qHS dosing
.
Pain- s/p CPR w/exquisite chest tenderness
- cover w/morphine IV
.
#FEN: replete lytes, IVF PRN. given TF at goals
.
Prophylaxis: PPI, pneumoboots, on coumadin and lovenox
.
#Access: PIV x 2, PICC placed
.
#Code: full as discussed with son
