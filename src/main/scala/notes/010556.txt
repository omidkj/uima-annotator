History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 15676**] is a 79 yo F c PMH sig HTN, GERD, Pulm HTN, CRI,

OSA, COPD, and diastolic CHF who reports dyspnea at home. She
called EMS, and when they arrived the patient was hypoxic,
80%RA. On presentation to ED she was tachypneic with RR 28, and
oxygen saturation 70%RA. According to the residents in the ER,
the patient denied chest pain. She had crackles on exam. She was

placed on CPAP. After awhile, she was taken off CPAP and was
breathing 90% on 4L NC, and was therefore placed back on CPAP.

Baseline artifact. Atrial pacing with ventricular sensing.
Intraventricular conduction defect. Extensive ST-T wave changes,
likely due to repolarization abnormality. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2140-11-4**] ventricular paced beats are not
seen on the current tracing. The other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms [**Known lastname 15676**] is an 80yo woman with chronic
diastolic CHF (EF > 55%), pulm HTN ([**12-19**] long-standing ASD in
past), COPD (on 5L O2 by NC at home and non-compliant w BiPAP),
OSA, who presented with dyspnea was found to have acute CHF
exacerbation.
.
# Dyspnea: Likely acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic
congestive heart failure. CXR demonstrated bilateral pulmonary
infiltrates, crackles on exam, pitting edema of lower
extremities and pannus. Home O2 requirement is 5L, per previous
discharge summaries.  She was initially given a Lasix bolus and
diuresed ~1 L daily.  BiPAP was started with improvement in CO2;
however, patient did not tolerate the BiPAP mask due to
discomfort.  She was thus transferred out of the ICU on 5 L
nasal cannula with O2 Sats in the upper 80s and low 90s, which
seemed to be similar to her baseline. Her diuresis was continued
until day of discharge, requiring 80IV at first and then
transitioning to PO doses. She was discharged on a lasix dose of
80mg PO BID.
.
# LE edema/pain: Pt had extensive LE edema and erythema, likely
[**12-19**] volume overload.  Legs were elevated and wrapped in ACE
bandages. Wound consult was obtained, they recommended skin
moisturizing and other supportive treatments which were
implemented.  There was low suspicion for DVT, but LE Doppler
examination was attempted; however, patient did not tolerate
this test.  Her pain improved by increasing her Neurontin dose
to 300mg in the AM and 100mg in the PM.
.
#Atrial fibrillation: Not on Coumadin [**12-19**] hx of hemorrhagic CVA.
 Metoprolol and ASA were continued.
.
#COPD:  Ipratropium nebs were given instead of home tiotropium.
.
#Hypothyroid: levothyroxine was continued at home dose.

During her hospitalization, there was also a family meeting
which concluded in the patient stating she is full code. She
wants to return home after discharge. She was evaluated by PT
and approved to go home. She will have VNA to assist with her
cardiopulmonary monitoring, home oxygen, and medications.

She was discharged home with a f/u appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**].
