Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 69f with metastatic renal cell ca, cva, and a recent
admission for GIB who presents with one week of fatigue and
pallor and was found to anemic at 26.6 (last hct from discharge
[**1-16**] was 30). She was recently admitted for [**Date range (1) 9892**] when her
pcp found her to have a hct of 24. She had a negative ng lavage,
guaiac negative, egd negative, colonoscopy negative, capsule
endoscopy negative; her fe studies showed a ferritin > [**2115**], and
the thought was that this was related to anemia of chronic
disease. She felt better after her admission, with a "rosy"
complexion; however, over the next few days she became
increasingly pale and fatigued. On the day of presentation, she
was confused, going into the wrong room at home, unable to
distinguish between dreams/reality; in the ed, she was a&o and
said she didn't feel confused, just that her thinking was
"slow." She denies recent f/c, ha, focal weakness,
lightheadeness, loc, vis changes, chest pain, sob, cough, abd
pain, n/v/d/c, back pain, dysuria/hematuria.
In the ED, she got 2units prbc and was seen by neurology.

CXR ([**2-1**]): CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.

The upper chest and thoracic inlet is excluded from the film.
Allowing for this, the ET tube is no longer visualized. There
are patchy interstitial and alveolar opacities centered about
both pulmonary hila. No upper zone redistribution or effusion is
identified. The opacities most likely represent resolving
changes due to pulmonary edema and are slightly decreased
compared with [**2121-1-31**]. Multiple clips noted in the abdomen.
Density over left upper quadrant is consistent with
calcification within the splenic artery.

IMPRESSION: Apparent removal of ET tube. Slight interval
improvement in perihilar infiltrates thought to represent
resolving pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation requested.

MRI Head ([**1-24**]): TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted
brain imaging. Diffusion-weighted images were obtained.

FINDINGS: Again seen are areas of T2 hyperintensity in the right
posterior parietal and both occipital lobes. Decreased signal
centrally in the occipital lobe foci are consistent with
necrosis. Increased T1 signal in the rims of these areas is
consistent with laminar necrosis. Associated susceptibility
within these foci are consistent with prior hemorrhage.
Diffusion sequences demonstrate thin rims of increased signal
which may be related to susceptibility or T2 shine-through. No
other diffusion abnormalities are identified to suggest acute
ischemia. T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular cerebral
white matter is consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
There is no hydrocephalus, mass effect, or shift of normally
midline structures. Surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable.

TECHNIQUE: 3-D time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
reconstructions.

FINDINGS: The major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are
patent without evidence of significant stenosis or aneurysmal
dilatation. Within the limits of this exam, no sign of an
arteriovenous malformation is apparent.

IMPRESSION:
1. Overall stable MRI appearance of the brain with
redemonstration of posterior parietal and occipital lobe
infarcts.
2. Normal circle of [**Location (un) 431**] MRA.

EEG ([**1-24**]): FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout this recording, the background rhythm

remained in the 5 to 6 Hz frequency range. They did not reach
normal
levels.
ABNORMALITY #2: Superimposed bursts of mixed frequency
generalized delta
and theta slowing were observed periodically. No sharp features
were
associated with this slowing.
BACKGROUND: As described above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Produced no activation of the
record.
SLEEP: The patient remained drowsy throughout the entire
recording with
no stage II sleep observed.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with average
rate of
72 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of
diffuse
background slowing throughout the recording. In addition,
overlying
bursts of generalized mixed frequency delta and theta slowing
were seen.
No epileptiform features were observed with this slowing. No
electrographic seizures were recorded. This EEG is most
consistent with
encephalopathy. Common causes of encephalopathy include
medications and
metabolic disturbances.



Brief Hospital Course:
FATIGUE/CONFUSION/WEAKNESS: Neurology was consulted in the ED
for evaluation. Among the findings was an MRI that showed no
focal findings, and an EEG that showed a toxic-metabolic
picture. She had a history of [**Doctor Last Name 4116**] syndrome ([**3-13**] bilateral
occipital/parietal CVA felt to be likely in the setting of
vertebro-basilar insufficiency), with an element of [**Doctor First Name 9893**]
syndrome (anosgnosia of visual deficit) elicited by the
neurologist, but otherwise had no new focal findings, and the
encephalopathy was attributed to toxic/metabolic etiology,
likely in the setting of hypercalcemia. She was also treated for
a UTI with Levofloxacin for 7 days.  She was also found to be
hyponatremic on admission; all of these factors, along with her
malnutrition in the setting of malignancy, likely contributed to
her presentation.  She was given IVFs aggressively, with
resolution of the hypercalcemia and hyponatremia. She was also
given pamidronate and calcitonin, and lasix for treatment of the
hypercalcemia. PTH was normal, and the hypercalcemia was
attributed to the patient's malignancy.  The calcium normalized
with the above treatment.  The patient's mental status improved,
although she had a persistent poor PO intake. She passed a
speech and swallow study, but was noted to have had a poor
appetite.  After intubation and ICU stay, her mental status
remained stable and she had a persistentl
