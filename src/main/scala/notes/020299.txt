Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1631**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia, hypercarbia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 89 year-old woman with history of MAC and
bronchiectasis presenting with cough prouductive of sputum,
fatigue, increased oxygen requirement. Over the past three weeks
patient has noted increased cough and over the past three days
the cough has been productive of yellow sputum. In addition, her
family reports she has been more fatigued, sleeping much of the
time. She was also noted to have oxygen desaturation at home
(one time to high 70s on 2L), so her family uptitrated her
oxygen to three liters. Patient also feels short of breath and
reports she cannot get out of bed, whereaas she is normally up
and out of bed much of the time. She denies fever, chills, chest
pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.8 76 90/45 24 91% 3L Nasal
Cannula. Patient had an EKG showing NSR without any acute ST
changes. She had a chest x-ray showing opacification of the left
lung base (atelectasis vs. pulmonary edema). She had an ABG
showing a pH of 7.29 and pCO2 of 91. She had a BNP of 3000 and
troponin of 0.04. She had a CTA given the elevated troponin,
which did not show a PE. Patient's pulmonologist was called and
recommended starting zosyn. Patient received cefepime, flaygl.
Respiratory therapy was called to initiate BIPAP, but deferred
as patient had recently eaten lunch.
On arrival to the MICU, patient continues to complain of
productive cough and fatigue. She does not currenly have
dyspnea, but feels that she would when she is ambulatory. On the
floor, patient fell asleep and desaturated to 79% on 4L. She
improved to mid-90s when awakened.

Imaging:
-CXR -  Opacification of the left lung base may represent
atelectasis,
however, pneumonia cannot be excluded in the right clinical
setting.
-CTA Chest - 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Thrombosis of the left inferior pulmonary vein is of
uncertain clinical significance.
3.  Extensive bibasilar bronchial mucoid impaction on the left
greater than the right increased from [**2136-7-9**] with stable
extensive chronic bronchiectasis and emphysematous changes.
4.  Age-indeterminate compression fracture of L1 vertebral body,
new from
[**2136-7-9**], with unchanged compression fracture of T8 and
vertebroplasty of T12
-Chest MRI - 1.  No evidence of persistent thrombus within the
left inferior pulmonary vein.
2.  The left inferior pulmonary vein has a somewhat flattened
appearance, but demonstrates patency both on flow based
techniques, as well as on anatomic and contrast enhanced images.

3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Left basilar
consolidation and
bronchiectasis demonstrated on the prior examination is less
evident here
(this examination tailored for assessment of the central
pulmonary veins).
