L thalamic hemorrhage

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 60 yo RHW with morbid obesity, HTN, DM and
asthma transferred her from [**Hospital3 **] after presenting with
syncope and found to have L thalamic hemorrhage with <3mm
midline
shift.  History is difficult to obtain from the patient given
dysarthria and frustration likely from fatigue causing less than
optimal cooperation.  Grand-daughter is at bedside but she was
not present at the time of injury/event hence unable to give
details other than that she was told, her grandmother fell while
in church at 2:30 pm and was found to be slurring her speech
hence taken to the hospital.

Per patient, she fell forward and hit her head because she
fainted.  She denies any chest pain, palpitations or headache.
She endorses that she had trouble speaking but she is unable to
clarify whether she had trouble thinking up the words, if wrong
words came out or if speech was just slurred.  She also reports
that she had double vision but cannot clarify whether it was
monocular/binocular or it was lateral, vertical or skewed.

She has trouble walking at baseline due to chronic arthritis.
Per grand-daughter, she has been compliant to her meds including
her anti-hypertensives and she quit smoking just this past year
after smoking for > 30 years.

ROS negative including fever, cough, N/V/D, unintended weight
loss or sick contact.  There has been no recent medication
changes.  Of note, patient SBP was in 200's while at [**Hospital3 **]

under control without intervention.
