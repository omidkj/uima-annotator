Shortness of Breath

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 60258**] is a 46 year-old woman with history of advanced
interstitial lung disease, likely NSIP, chronic diastolic CHF,
DM, and chronic pain s/p MVA who initially presented to [**Hospital 6451**] on [**2114-3-12**] with worsening shortness of breath. Of
note, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with respiratory
failure from [**2114-2-14**]- [**2114-2-23**]. During that admission, her
respiratory failure was felt to be secondary to diastolic CHF,
HCAP and possibly an ILD flare. She was treated with steroids,
diuresis and antibiotics. In follow up conversation with her
pulmonologist, he seemed to think that her respiratory failure
was more related to her mitral stenosis and recommended tapering
off steroids in the next 2 weeks as well as a follow up TEE and
heart cath.
.
Per the patient, since d/c from [**Hospital1 18**], she has had worsening
shortness of breath and "bloating." She also had been
experiencing high fevers at home, up to 105. She attributes some
of these symptoms to the steroids and reports that she had some
improvement after tapering off of the steroids. However, she did
continue to feel bad and ultimately presented to [**Hospital3 **]
yesterday for evaluation. She also endorses exertional chest
pain, which she describes as electric-shocklike, located in the
central and left chest. She also bas been having panic attacks,
with shortness of breath and heart palpitations. She also has
had a dry cough recently, which improves with albuterol.
.
While at [**Hospital3 417**], she was seen by the cardiology and
pulmonary consult services. Labs were significant for a WBC of
12.4 which improved to 6.6. She underwent a CXR, which shoed
pulmonary congestion with confluent densities (greater on R), ?
infiltrates vs. edema. CT chest was also performed, which showed
"complex scan with acute and chronic lung disease, increased
infiltration could be due to infection and CHF mediastinal hilar
adenopathy." ABG was performed on [**2114-3-12**] on 15LPM NRB and
showed pO2 65, pCO2 41, pH 7.42. She was treated with
levofloxacin, nebs, and IV lasix. She requested transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] given that her providers are primarily located here.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient's VS were T=99.5 BP=110/73
HR=90 RR=20 O2 sat=95%/5L.
.
Review of systems was generally pan-positive. She endorsed
chornic back pain as well as the above symptoms listed in the
HPI. She denied any N/V/D/C or urinary symptoms.

Family History:
(per OMR): She has two children. She has several relatives who
have had lung problems and has died from complications related
lung disease. Her mother had COPD, died of respiratory failure,

C-cath [**2114-3-14**]
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed
no significant coronary artery disease.  The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and
RCA
were all normal without angiographically apparent flow limited
disease.
The LCx had a large ramus branch.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right
sided
filling pressures with mean PCWP 29mmHg and RVEDP 15mmHg.  There
was
severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 69 mmHg.
Central aortic
pressures were normal at 137/80 with a mean of 97 mmHg.
3. The mean mitral valve gradient was 13.5 mmHg and calculated
MVA 1.23
cm2 with excellent hemodynamic tracings, oxygen saturation
confirmed
PCWP and reversed transducers.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate mitral stenosis with valve area 1.23 cm2, mean
transmitral
pressure gradient 13.4 mmHg.
3. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
4. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.

TTE [**2114-3-15**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No ao
