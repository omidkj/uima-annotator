History of Present Illness:
58 year old female with a history of HTN, diastolic HF, carotid
artery stenosis s/p endarterectomy and stent, seizure d/o, and
remote history of cocaine abuse who presented to the ED today
with a chief complaint of leg tingling. Ms. [**Known lastname 50416**] reports
that at around noon today, she was about to go in the shower
when she began to feel lightheaded and weak. She began to also

nitroglycerine x 2, [**Known lastname **] 325 without relief. She was subsequently
started on a nitroprusside gtt. Chest pain resolved in the ED
prior to being admitted to the CCU. She also began to have
bilateral occipital headache while on the nitroprusside gtt. Her
headache is now [**6-11**] in severity. Also of note, in the ED, her
CTA was negative for dissection and PE and her CT head was
without evidence of an acute bleed.
.
She notes that she has dyspnea on exertion to 2 to 3 blocks and
2 flights of stairs. She denies history of chest pain prior to
this admission. She reports mild ankle edema bilaterally. She
denies orthopnea and PND.

.
Imaging:
CXR: There is mild cardiomegaly. The aorta is elongated. The
lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
.
Head CT w/o contrast: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally
midline structures. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is
preserved. Again demonstrated are bilateral wedge-shaped
hypodensities within the parietal lobes consistent with old
watershed infarction. Also again noted are multiple small
hypodensities within the basal ganglia bilaterally, notable in
the left globus pallidus and right subinsular region, consistent
with prior lacunar infarctions. The ventricles are normal in
size and symmetric. There is no evidence of acute major vascular
territorial infarction. The visualized paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear. Surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute major vascular
territorial infarction.
.
Chest CTA: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aneurysm, dissection, pulmonary embolism, or
pneumonia.
2. Calcified mediastinal lymph node, may be related to old
granulomatous disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old female with a history of HTN, diastolic HF, seizure
d/o, and remote history of cocaine abuse admitted with
hypertensive urgency.
.
#. Hypertensive urgency: Patient admitted with mild chest pain
and significantly increased blood pressures.  Improved on
Nitroprusside drip with blood pressure control.  There is no
evidence of end organ ischemia. CT was negative for an acute
cerebrovascular process. There was also no evidence of
myocardial infarction on serial ECGs and cardiac biomarkers were
negative x3. CTA in addition was negative for aortic dissection.
Her poorly controlled blood pressure is in the setting of poor
compliance with medications and cocaine abuse.  Was started on
clonidine patch as she stated she often missed doses of her oral
clonidine.  She was continued on her outpatient HCTZ and
Lisinopril.  She was not started on any medications with beta
blockade given her toxicology screen was positive for cocaine.
She was additionally started on a low dose of Norvasc which can
be increased at her follow up with her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
10 days.
.
#. Pump: History of diastolic heart failure, increased JVP on
admission, likely elevated in the setting of hypertensive
urgency.  JVP decreased with blood pressure control.
.
#. Rhythm: Sinus rhythm, no active issues. Patient was placed on
telemetry during her admission with no significant events.
.
#. Chest pain: Improved with blood pressure control.  Was likely
in the setting of elevated blood pressures. No ischemic EKG
changes. Cardiac biomarkers negative x 3. CTA negative for
aortic dissection.
.
#. Carotid artery stenosis: s/p endarterectomy and stent.
Patient was continued on her outpatient regimen of plavix.
.
#. Seizure disorder: No evide
