Allergies:
Penicillins / Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, hypoxia.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy x3 ([**8-2**], [**8-3**], [**8-7**])

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1924**] is a 65 y/o man with history of AAA repair ([**1-/2163**])
c/b T8 paraplegia, bowel perforation leading to graft infection
with bacteriodes, strep pneumo and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 23729**]/fungemia on
chronic suppressive medications (antibiotics and antifungals -
fluconazole, cipro, flagyl), recently admitted and discharged on
[**7-9**] for PNA, who represented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-1**] from [**Hospital 38**]
rehab w/ increasing white count to 39, increased shortness of
breath, increased cough and inability to clear his airway
secretions.

During his previous admission he had CT imaging demonstrating
collapsed lower lobe with concern for chronic infectious process
vs mucus plugging. Given acute deterioration in respiratory
function he underwent bronchoscopy that demonstrated purulent
secretions in the LLL c/w infection. His antibiotics were
broadened from cipro/flagyl/fluconazole (chronic suppressive
meds) to levofloxacin/vancomycin/flagyl/fluconazole. He was
discharged with plan for 14 days on this abx course, with plan
to go back on his chronic suppressive therapy afterwards.
However, after discharge, pt grew resistant Pseudomonas in his
BAL fluid culture.  Readmitted on [**8-1**] directly to the MICU for
worsening SOB with sats in the high 70s. In the MICU, ID was
consulted who started patient on meropenem to cover bacteroides
and pseudomonas PNA. Patient was bronched multiple time since
admission to remove mucus plugs which imporves patient's
repiratory symptoms.
.
Currently, he feels better from a respiratory standpoint.
Reports occasional SOB which improves with suctioning.
.
ROS: Otherwise positive for occasional pleuritic CP, chest
heaviness, occasional pain from his abdominal surgical area with
tenderness though unchanged. Denies fever, chills, sweats.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, change in stool from ostomy,
no melena or BRB from ostomy. He has no feeling from his penis
so would not know if he had burning, and chronically has a
foley.

Past Medical History:
- AAA repair ([**1-/2163**]) c/b T8 paraplegia, bowel perforation with
graft infection and bacteremia/fungemia (bacteriodes, strep
pneumo and [**Female First Name (un) **]). On chronic suppressive medications with
suppressive antibiotics with ciprofloxacin, Flagyl and
fluconazole.
- complete heart block, now status post pacemaker placement
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia
- COPD
- Osteoarthritis
- Increased PSA for which the patient underwent a biopsy prior
to [**2163-1-29**], which was complicated by an E. coli bacteremia
- s/p Trach for inability to clear secretions

Social History:
Has 50 pack-year smoking history who stopped smoking prior to
his admission in [**Month (only) 404**]. He has a pet dog. He is married with a
very supportive wife and children. He works as a wine
distributor but is currently on disability and also retired a
year ago.
