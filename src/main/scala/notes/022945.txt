chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath with PCI to SVG-RCA


History of Present Illness:
75yo man with h/o CAD s/p several NSTEMIs and CABG x 4 in [**2156**],
hyperlipidemia, chronic Afib, CHF, [**Hospital 11491**] transferred from
[**Hospital6 **] for PCI of instent restenosis of
SVG-RCA graft. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**2169-10-8**] with
complaints of SSCP radiating to bilateral fifth fingers, assoc
with slight sensation of nausea and dyspnea, not relieved by one
tab SLNTG but then relieved in ED by second tab SLNTG. Noted to
have inferior depressions on admission EKG. Pt was treated at
MWMC with heparin for rising troponin and with lasix 40mg IV x
once for evidence of CHF. Pt then went for diagnostic cardiac
cath today which revealed instent restenosis of SVG-RCA, which
may have been worse then stenosis known to exist (see PMH below
for details). Was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for PCI of graft by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1295**].
.
In cath lab, the Prowater guide passed through the diseased
artery with some difficulty. The lesions were then pre-dilated
with a 3.0mm cutting balloon, which was noted to cause immediate
no-reflow. Subsequently, three 3.5mm Taxus stents were placed in
overlapping fashion (28, 24, 20 mm distal to proximal), and the
vein graft was infused with adenosine and Nipride. It was felt
that there was likely thrombus in the stents thereafter, a
complication of the no-reflow phenomenon. Therefore, a temporary
pacer was inserted, Filter Wire placed, Angiojet amd Export
thrombectomyc caths were used with good result.  Eventually TIMI
[**1-8**] flow was restored, ST elevation improved, chest pain
resolved. At the intended end of the procedure, however, the
patient had a sudden VF arrest, was defibrillated, though the VF
recurred two more times requiring one shock per episode to
revert to sinus. He was given an Amio bolus, rhythm remained
sinus. Relook angio revealed return of no-reflow, again treated
with intracoronary vasodilators with some improvement. ST
elevations in inferior leads returned. Patient's BP dropped
transiently, necessitating dopamine, but this was rapidly weaned
off. No residual stenosis seen on relook. Patient was noted to
be in NSR leaving cath, had been in Afib prior to procedure. Was
transferred to CCU for continued management of STEMI, close
observation given VFib arrest.

Catheterization:
PTCA COMMENTS:     The angiogram at the [**Hospital1 **] facility
showed
critical diffuse, lengthy, eccentric narrowing in the SVG to the
RCA. We
planned to predilate and stent the lesion which was within the
previously stented segments. The arterial and venous sheaths
which were
in situ from the transferring hospital were changed to new
sheaths under
sterile conditions with iv antibiotic cover. We used Heparin and

Integrillin prphylactically. A 6F sideholed JR 4 guide provided
adequate
support. An Asahi prowater wire crossed the lesion without
difficulty
and was placed in the distal vessel. We then placed a 3.0 X 15
Cutting
balloon in the distal most portion of the lesion, and inflated
it to 10
atm thrice, from distal to proximal. The subsequent angiogram
showed
TIMI 1 flow upto the mid [**Last Name (un) **] and TIMI 0 from there onward
suggesting no
reflow phenominon. The patient also developed chest pain and
inferior ST
elevation. We then delivered 3 taxus stents from the distal to
the
proximal part of the lesion in an ovelapping manner, measuring
3.5 X 28,
3.5 X 24 and 3.5 X 20 with no diffculty and deployed them at 18,
20 and
18 atm respectively. The second stent balloon was used to post
dilate
the overlap between the first and the second stents once to 20
atm.
The TIMI 0 reflow progressed to the proximal RCA. We then used
an ultrafuse catheter to deliver IC medications, particularly
given
the JR4 catheter had side holes in it and administered  IC
adenosine and
Nitruprusside in varying amounts with no success. We then placed
a EZ
300 cm filter wire in the distal vessel and an Angiojet catheter

proximal to it, with no difficulty. We then placed a 5F pacing
wire in  the floor of the RV for demand pacing. We then
performed 4
passes with the angiojet with flow improving up to TIMI I - II
and the
chest pain subsiding.  The angiogram showed some underexpansion
of the
proximally placed stent, which was post dilated using a NC
ranger 3.5 X
18 balloon at 20, 22 and 22 atm with satisfactory result. How
ever the
flow still remained to be TIMI II and we then advanced an export

catheter in the the distal vessel and aspirated the contents.
After
multiple injections of the above medications and the procedures
the flow
remained to be TIMI II. At this point the patient developed
coarse VF
three times one after the other and necessitated 3 shocks at
200, 300
and 360 J with successful cardioversion each time. The
subsequent
angiogram showed worsening flow of the RCA and the patient
became
hypotensive. We then commenced a Dopamine infusion which was
turned off
with improvement in blood pressure soon after. The ECG was
unchanged and
the patient continued to have some chest dyscomfort though to a
lesser
degeree. After consensus opinion, we elected not to intervene
any
further at this stage, given the hemodynamic stability of the
patient.
The patient left the lab in a hemodynamically stable condition.

1. Critical instent restonisis of the SVG to the RCA.
2. Predilation using 3.0 X 15 cutting balloon,placement of three
Cypher
stents in the SVG instent restenosis using 3.0 X 28, 3.0 X 24
and 3.0 X
20 stents and post dilatation using NC Ranger balloon with
lesion
reduction from 80% to 0%. The procedure was complicated by no
reflow
with TIMI 0 flow with subsequent extensive pharmacological and
mechanical manupulation using
