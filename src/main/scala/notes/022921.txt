Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
86yo man with significant cardiac history with hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, CAD s/p CABG, CHF and COPD (requiring 1.5
L at baseline) presented to the emergency department with
several complaints, including overall weakness, lethargy, cough
and constipation/diffuse abdominal pain.

Initial vitals in the ED were 96.0, 133, 122/56, 22, and 94% on
NRB -> 86% on 3L NC.  While in teh ED, he received treatments
directed at his COPD with solumedrol and combivent; his CHF with
lasix; and finally potential
PNA with levaquin. CXR revealed CHF w/ b/l effusions.

Admitted to the MICU and observed o/n, swallowing studies
revealed aspiration of thin liquids. Antibiotics were d/c'd in
MICU as pt was not felt to have infiltrate on CXR or definitive
infection (afebrile and w/ improving WBC). Called out to floor
on [**12-31**] and arrived on 50% VM with SPO2 in 90% range. Diuresed
with increasing lasix regimen over the next several days with
net urine output ranging from 200-1000cc/ 24hrs. Despite
diuresis, pt with persistent 02 requirement (on 50% venti mask)
along with bilateral effusions; with 40IV [**Hospital1 **] lasix, BP in
90-100 range with decreasing urine output. Transferred to CHF
service for likely natrecor +/- dopamine.

Past Medical History:
1) CAD s/p CABG in '[**99**]
2) CHF with EF of 35%
3) atrial fibrillation
4) hypercholesterolemia
5) COPD
6) vertigo
7) spinal stenosis
8) h/o myocardial infarction, last reportedly
one month ago in setting of UGI bleed
9) recent UGI bleed ([**10-12**] [**Hospital1 2025**])--> 2 vessels cauterized

Social History:
reports no etoh/drugs/current tobacco (past history of 1 [**1-9**] ppd
for 15 years)
Now lives in [**Hospital3 **] facility. Has support from two
daughters.

Physical Exam:
97.6, 109, 90-100/50-52, 50% venti mask w/ SPO2 91-94%

gen: AOx2, dysarthric, tachypneic
heent: perrl, eomi; ptosis of right eye lid
CV: irregular, tachycardic; no m/r/g
resp: + b/l decreased BS w/o ronchi
and dullness to percussion at bilateral lung bases.
abd: soft, NT, ND; normoactive bowel sounds
extr: 1+ pitting edema bilaterally with stasis changes and
erosion on right heel and 3 X 5cm ulceration with surrounding

.
admit CXR:
Bilateral effusions with nontypical CHF due to underlying
emphysema
.
echo
Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation.
.
KUB: There are gas-filled loops of non-dilated small bowel with
gas present in the colon and rectum and no evidence for
intestinal obstruction. There are vascular calcifications. No
obvious soft tissue masses or radiopaque calculi.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted with decompensated heart failure and blood
pressure could not tolerate his home diuretic regimen.  Pt was
admitted to the MICU and then to the floor after he had
stabilzed.  The hypoxia was thought to be [**2-9**] aspiration
pneumonia and CHF.  Despite maximizing diuretics and treating
the pneumonia, pt's oxygen requirement continued to increase.
After discussions with the family and emphasizing the pt's poor
prognosis, the decision was made to make the patient
comfortable.  He was placed on a morphine drip and expired soon
thereafter.
