Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 3197**] was admitted on [**2105-9-18**] for a completion
gastrectomy and a J-tube placement due to his gastric cancer.
After the operation, pt originally did well but then had
increasing amounts of bile out of his nasogastric tube and signs
of obstruction. He also had some desaturations and the chest
x-ray showed some question of infiltrates in the left lung. CT
scan showed significant collapse of a portion of the left lower
lobe. The patient was brought to the operating room for
reduction of this obstruction which seems to be at the level of
the jejunostomy tube as well as improvement in his pulmonary
situation. On [**9-22**], the pt had a CT abdomen that showed an SBO
at the J-tube site. In the OR, he was found to have a moderate
dilatation of the transverse colon with gas.  There was
obstruction of the jejunum proximal to the jejunostomy tube site
which seemed to be somewhat kinked over but also probably was
somewhat narrowed by the tube.  Findings on bronchoscopy
included some fairly significant mucus plugs in the left lower
lobe.   A BAL grew out EColi and Enterobacter. Post-op, the pt
had fevers and was started on vanc and cipro. A CXR showed
atelectasis and bilateral pulm effusions. Pt then had some
incisional erythema. The pt was d/c'd from the SICU on [**9-27**]. Pt
developed a low-grade pressure ulcer, for which he had a wound
care consult. On [**9-30**], pt had increasing amounts of abdominal
pain, nausea, and bilious vomiting - but his abdomen was soft,
he passed flatus, and was afebrile. He had an upper GI study to
evaluate for obstruction. This study was consistant with
obstruction at the new or old J-tube site and clear distal to
the J-tube. The pt was made strict NPO and his tube feeds were
continued. His nausea slowly resolved. He had small-volume
bilious emesis for several days prior to d/c. One wound culture
was found to have VRE, sparse growth.
