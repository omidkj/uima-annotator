HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old
gentleman, with a history of CAD status post CABG in [**2098**],
recently found to have had radiographic evidence of
gallbladder cancer, possibly metastatic.  The patient was
scheduled for an ERCP of the stones which were visualized in
the common bile duct with dilatation in [**Month (only) 956**] of this
year.  He presented yesterday and developed mild right upper
quadrant pain after eating.  The pain was relieved with
Tylenol #3.  Over the course of the night, he developed
fevers up to 101.0 without recurrence of pain.  No nausea or
vomiting.  He did have diarrhea, but no melena or bright red
blood per rectum, about once per day.  He called his PCP and
was told to come in for antibiotics and emergent ERCP.

shortness of breath.  No dyspnea on exertion.  No orthopnea.
Recent diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton syndrome, positive dark
urine, and about a 20-pound weight loss over the last month.

In the Emergency Room, no blood cultures drawn, but was
started on IV levo and Flagyl.

gallbladder fossa consistent with cholangiocarcinoma,
?extension into the abdomen.  Right lobe of the liver had the
lesion concerning for metastatic disease.  Stone in the
gallbladder which migrated to the common bile duct with
common bile duct dilatation.  Unchanged intrahepatic biliary
dilatation.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound the same as CT
of the abdomen.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 85-year-old gentleman, with a history
of CAD status post CABG, recent CT evidence of gallbladder
cancer, and common bile duct stones and dilatation, presented
with right upper quadrant pain and fevers.

1) CHOLANGITIS:  The patient elevated LFTs and fever.  He was
empirically started on IV Flagyl, gentamicin and ampicillin
initially to cover Enterococcus and anaerobes.  His LFTs were
followed and his gent level was followed.  The patient was
taken then for ERCP the day of admission, and had extraction
of multiple stones, cytology sent from the common bile duct,
and had a sphincterotomy.  Following the procedure was noted
to have temps to 103.4 and systolic blood pressures in the
80s.  He was started on amp, gent and Flagyl, and given 2
liters of normal saline boluses with no improvement in blood
pressure.

Heart rate was in the 90s and the patient met criteria for
sepsis protocol, and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management.  During his time there, he had a central line
placed, and was aggressively fluid resuscitated. He was also
given 1 unit of packed red blood cells and blood pressure
responded.  He was also started on hydrocortisone
empirically, but was DC'd on [**4-10**].  His hospital course
was otherwise significant for an episode of dyspnea on the 14
and felt to be secondary to CHF and fluid overload, as had
been 2.7 liters positive, and with a new left infiltrate.
Eventually, gentamicin was discontinued and Levofloxacin was
started.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled, and the patient was
feeling well with stable blood pressure, and was transferred
to the floor.

Eventually for his cholangitis, he was continued on amp,
levo, Flagyl.  Eventually, ampicillin was discontinued, and
the patient was continued on levo and Flagyl.  He remained
afebrile and was otherwise stable on this regimen.  He
continued to have some slight episodes of diarrhea which he
says was more chronic for him.  Stool studies were sent and
are still pending.  One set was negative for C. diff, and
bacterial culture was negative, as was the Campylobacter.
Otherwise, the patient was stable from a GI perspective.  He
was tolerating a PO diet, and bronchial washings from ERCP
are still pending at the time of this dictation.

2) PNEUMONIA:  Concern for left lower lobe pneumonia, but was
covered on antibiotics for the above cholangitis, levo and
Flagyl, and this was otherwise stable, and the patient
remained stable off oxygen and did not desaturate while
ambulating, and was on room air for the last 48 hours before
discharge.

3) CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient's coronaries had no evidence
of edema.  He was continued on an aspirin and an ACE.  He was
otherwise stable.  After mild diuresis in the Intensive Care
Unit, he was stable volume wise, and no other difficulties
from a cardiac standpoint.

4) ANEMIA:  The patient had OP negative stools and had slight
crit drops.  His crits were stable and was only transfused
the 1 unit in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], and otherwise stable.  The patient
had normal iron studies, and these are just likely from
chronic disease.

5) [**Location (un) **]-[**Location (un) 10107**] SYNDROME:  Likely paraneoplastic syndrome,
but was stable on the prostigmin.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.  The patient was ambulating with
a walker without desaturations on room air.  The patient was
seen and evaluated by physical therapy with difficulty going
up stairs and planned for [**Hospital 3058**] rehab to work on
mobility up stairs, and then the patient can be discharged
home, as his daughter-in-law where he would live lives on the
[**Location (un) 1773**].  Otherwise, no other acute issues and
tolerating PO.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge to rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Cholangitis.
2. Sepsis.
3. Pneumonia.
4. Congestive heart failure.
5. Coronary artery disease.
6. Anemia.
7. [**Location (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Oxycodone 10 mg po q 4-6 h prn.
2. Prostigmin 60 mg po q 8.
3. Combivent inhaler 1-2 puffs inhaled q 6 h prn.
4. Levofloxacin 250 mg po qd.
5. Enalapril qd.
6. Aspirin 81 mg po qd.
7. Tylenol 325-650 mg po q 4-6--no more than 2 gm.
8. Flagyl 500 mg po tid.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**8-6**]
days.  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10108**] for repeat
endoscopy, and the patient is to follow-up for a repeat
vascular study in two week's time.
