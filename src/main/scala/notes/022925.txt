History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with h/oCAD s/p anterior MI in [**2-15**] with a stent to
the LAD.  This was complicated by dissection of LM, which was
then stented (jailing the LCx).  Had a relook [**Date Range **] in [**5-17**] with
patent LM, LAD stentsbut extensive 3vd.  He presented today with
acute SOB and subsequently found to be in CHF.  He also had ST
depressions in V3-V5 and a TroponinT of .54.  He received
heparin, integrillin and IV lasix in the ED and taken to [**Date Range **]
lab.
[**Date Range **] showed patent LM, LAD stents, but occluded LCx.  Procedure
was complicated by inability to pass a wire into the LCx(the
stent in the LM was protruding into the aorta).  Therefore, he
was not revascularized.  Also had elevated PCWP=30 and a mixed
venous O2 of 46%. He was started on dobutamine and this
increased to 62%.  Currently, he is feeling much better.  Now
without CP, SOB, as compared to the morning, when he had PND,
SOB, and his anginal symptoms.

[**Month/Day/Year **]:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed severe coronary artery disease. The LMCA was extremely
difficult to engage.  It was eventually best engaged with a JL5
cattheter.  The LMCA had only mild disease. The LAD had diffuse
disease.
The previously placed LAD stent was patent.  The LCx was totally

occluded.  The RCA was not engaged.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with a depressed cardiac index.
3.  Failed PCI of the LCX.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  NSTEMI.
2.  Severe coronary artery disease.
3.  Elevated filling pressures and depressed cardiac output.
4.  Failed PCI of the LCX.

Abd CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or intraperitoneal
hematoma.
2. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 4.2 cm in
greatest dimension.
3. Bowel containing right inguinal hernia without evidence of
bowel obstruction.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.

Echo: EF=35%
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity
size are normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic
dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal half of the
inferior and
inferolateral walls and distal lateral and apical walls. The
remaining
segments contract well (suboptimal views). Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review)
of [**2-15**], the inferior and inferolateral dysfunction is new c/w
interim
ischemia/infarction. The severity of mitral regurgitation has
slightly
increased.


Brief Hospital Course:
This [**Age over 90 **] yo male with a CAD history came from the [**Age over 90 **] lab on
dobutamine due to CHF in the setting of his acute MI.  He was
not able to be revascularized.

1.CAD: He was put on ASA, Plavix, and a statin, but not heparin,
as his vessel is totally occluded.  A B-blocker and ACE-I were
initially held due to hypotension.  His enzymes were followed
until they began to trend down.  NTG was used as needed for
chest pain.  His BP began to improve, and his dobutamine was
weaned off.  An ACE-I was gradually added as his BP would
tolerate, and then a B-blocker was added as he recovered
further.  On D/C, he was on stable doses of both with good
tolerance of his BP and heart rate.  He remained CP free
throughout the hospitalization.  He had daily ECGs which showed
no new ischemia.  He was sent home with NTG to use for anginal
pain.
2.Pump:  He was initially in CHF with high filling pressures and
MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  Likely result of acute MI.  He was initially on
dobutamine post-[**Last Name (Titles) **].  This was weaned, but his BP was kept at
levels high enough to ensure renal perfusion and adequate CO.
He was also given Lasix as needed for gentle diuresis as his BP
would tolerate.  This improved his pulmonary symptoms.  In
addition, an ACE-
