Admission Date:  [**2157-12-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2157-12-12**]

Service:  BLOOMGART

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 60-year-old male
with history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
on 3 liters home oxygen who continues to smoke, who presented
with severe shortness of breath on [**2157-12-4**].  Patient's
oxygen saturation was initially 82% on room air.  He improved
100% non-rebreather with an ABG at that time of 7.71/71/204.
Patient tried on BiPAP but ultimately required intubation and
Intensive Care Unit admission.

Per history, he complained of shortness of breath for one
month prior to admission with a productive cough for one week
prior to admission.  He denied fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, or chest pain.  Chest x-ray did not reveal any
acute infiltrate or failure.  However, temperature was 100.4
and admission white count of 11.8.

In addition, patient gives history of multiple sick contacts
with grandchildren with the flu.

In the Emergency Room patient received p.o. Azithromycin and
Solu-Medrol 125 mg intravenously and was subsequently
admitted to the MICU, where he was continued on intravenous
steroids and antibiotics until extubation on [**2157-12-7**].  He
was then continued on p.o. steroids, continued on a course of
Azithromycin, and called out to the floor.

Of note, he had a troponin peak of 0.51 attributed to demand
ischemia while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  He
continued to receive his daily aspirin, but his beta blocker
was held secondary to his chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease flare.  This medication was added back on [**2157-12-8**].

During his stay in the MICU he was evaluated for failure to
thrive with a CT of the chest which was negative for
malignancy considering his history of tobacco use.  A
Nutrition consult was obtained, and he was administered
parenteral nutrition while intubated considering his history
of not eating for weeks prior to admission.  Also during his
MICU stay, he was noted to have 20 beats of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 3 liters home
O2.  No history of intubation; however, history of multiple
steroid tapers, greater than 10 per year.
2.  Low back pain.
3.  Rheumatoid arthritis treated in the past, currently now
off any treatments.
4.  No history of coronary artery disease.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with history of coronary artery
disease with first myocardial infarction at age of 52.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive one pack per day.  No alcohol.
Patient lives with four grandchildren, all of whom have
recently had the flu.  He also lives with his daughter.
[**Name (NI) **] is disabled secondary to his severe lung disease.  In
the past he worked detailing cars.

LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC DATA:  White count on call out to
the floor 14.4, hematocrit 36.1, Chem-10 notable for a
potassium of 3.4, bicarbonate of 30.  Serial cardiac enzymes:
CK-MB ranged from 6 to 12, troponin T peaked at 0.51 but
subsequently trended down.

Echo on [**2157-12-7**] showed an ejection fraction of 45%,
pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 37, basal inferior, mid
inferior, basal and mid inferolateral akinesis, and 3+ mitral
regurgitation 0.8%.  Iron 41, TIBC 230, B12 815, folate 4.5.

EKG at admission:  Sinus tachycardia at 138 beats per minute
with some left axis deviation compared to old EKG, normal
intervals, left atrial enlargement, low voltages, [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depression in V5 which resolved on repeat EKG.

Chest x-ray:  No acute infiltrate, lungs hyperinflated,
calcified pleural plaque at the left lung bases, emphysema.

CT of the chest negative for a malignancy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 60-year-old male with history of
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 3 liters home
oxygen who presented on [**2157-12-4**] with severe shortness of
breath diagnosed as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation requiring intubation.  During the course of the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital stay he was extubated and converted to
p.o. steroids with stabilization of his symptoms.

1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare:  Patient
initially presented with an O2 sat of 82% on room air.  He
was placed on 100% non-rebreather.  However, he developed a
respiratory alkalosis.  A trial BiPAP was initiated, but
patient failed and ultimately was intubated.  He received 125
mg intravenous Solu-Medrol and one dose of p.o. Azithromycin
in the Emergency Room and was subsequently admitted to the
MICU where he was continued on intravenous steroids and
antibiotics until extubation on [**2157-12-7**], at which time he
was converted to p.o. steroids and continued to complete a
five-day course of Azithromycin.

Patient with multiple sick contacts, living with four
grandchildren, all of whom have recently had the flu; thus,
patient continued on droplet precautions as influenza likely
the precipitator of his COPD exacerbation.

Following call out to the floor, patient continued on
Albuterol and Atrovent.  He was discharged with a p.o.
steroid taper in addition to a prescription for one week of
Ativan as he developed some symptoms of increasing dyspnea
prior to discharge thought to be attributed to anxiety.
Patient discharged on his home 3 liters of supplemental
oxygen with strong urging to cease further tobacco use.

2.  Cardiac ischemia:  Patient with troponin peak of 0.51
attributed to demand ischemia in the context of tachycardia
and hypoxia.  Troponin subsequently trended down and CK-MB
remained within normal limits.  Patient continued on daily
aspirin and his beta blocker was restarted upon call out to
the floor.  It was initially held secondary to COPD
exacerbation.

Hospital records obtained from patient's primary care
physician office show no evidence of history of coronary
artery disease.  Patient is to follow up with his primary
care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] is also noted to be a cardiologist, for
continued follow up and possible exercise stress test.

Patient cannot be currently stressed secondary to acute COPD
flare.

3.  Episode of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia:
Patient with history of 20 beats nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia while in the MICU.  Patient continued on
telemetry following call out to the floor.

Patient continued to have episodes of four to five beats
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  He was asymptomatic
during these episodes.  A beta blocker was added following
call out to the floor and no further events were seen.  Of note,
patient with ejection fraction greater than 30%, thus no
indication for pacemaker and pt not interested in further workup
for this .

4.  Failure to thrive:  Patient presents with history of poor
p.o. intake times weeks prior to admission.  A chest CT was
negative for lung cancer.  A Nutrition consult was obtained.
Patient received parenteral nutrition while intubated, and
good p.o. was encouraged following extubation with
supplemental Boost and Neutro-Phosphate supplementation.

Patient noted to have an ejection fraction of 45% with 3+
mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram obtained during this
admission.  Intravenous fluids were administered with
caution.  Patient's blood pressure was carefully controlled
with a beta blocker.  His blood pressures did not permit the
addition of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

Patient maintained on a regular sliding scale insulin p.r.n.

5.  Elevated white count likely secondary to steroids:
Patient without signs or symptoms of infection other than
history of probable influenza exposure on droplet
precautions.

6.  Normocytic anemia:  Primary care physician not available
to discuss regarding the duration of patient's anemia.
Reticulocyte count was obtained and noted to be low.
However, the remainder of patient's CBC is within normal
limits, so unlikely this is secondary to bone marrow
involvement.  Patient instructed to follow up with his
primary care physician as this may simply be secondary to
increased white blood cells due to steroid administration.
Of note, patient's folate, B12, TSH,
