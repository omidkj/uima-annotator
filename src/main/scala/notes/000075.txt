***** [**2172-1-12**] CT CHEST:
Reason: Please eval extent and location of loculation and PNA

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
35 year old man with Downs syndrome and lg PNA with loculations
on CXR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval extent and location of loculation and PNA
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

STUDY: CT chest without contrast and reconstructions.

INDICATION: 35-year-old male with Down syndrome and pleural
loculations on chest x- ray. Initial presentation is right upper
quadrant pain and fever.

COMPARISON: Chest x-ray from the same date.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the
thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen without intravenous contrast
administration. Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.

Intravenous contrast was not administered secondary to elevated
creatinine.

CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: The thyroid gland is grossly
unremarkable. The major airways are patent down to the
subsegmental level. The unopacified heart and great vasculature
are grossly unremarkable without pericardial effusion given
limitation of no IV contrast administration. There are scattered
prominent lymph nodes within the mediastinum, the largest of
which measures 1.5cm in short axis in a subcarinal location. No
axillary adenopathy is present. Limited views of the upper
abdomen without contrast demonstrate no abnormalities within the
liver, stomach, adrenal glands or spleen so far as visualized.

The left lung is clear. There is a small left pleural effusion.
Multiple loculated right-sided pleural fluid collections are
noted. The largest of these is along the right upper lobe
measuring approximately 12.2 x 4.4 cm in greatest dimension. Two
other prominent loculations lie in the right lung base, the
larger of which measures 7.4 x 7.2 cm. The attenuation of these
pleural collections is consistent with simple fluid. Compressive
atelectasis is noted in the right lung with septal thickening at
the right lung base. There is no pneumothorax.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
detected.

IMPRESSION:

1. Loculated right pleural fluid collections. Given the absence
of contrast evaluation for enhancement and nodularity along the
pleura is limited.
2. Septal thickening and atelectasis in the right lung.
3. Borderline mediastinal lymphadenopathy, may be reactive.
4. Small left pleural effusion.

***** [**2172-1-12**] RUQ ULTRASOUND:
Reason: Please eval for GB pathology or other pathology
contributing

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
35 year old man with fever, jaundice, RUQ tenderness
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval for GB pathology or other pathology contributing to
his sx
INDICATION: 35-year-old man with fever, jaundice, right upper
quadrant tenderness.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: There is a subtle rounded hyperechoic area seen
adjacent to the right hepatic vein, measuring approximately 2.5
cm in greatest dimension. No definite Doppler flow is seen
within this lesion. No other definite focal lesion is identified
within the liver. Gallbladder appears unremarkable, without
evidence of stones. Normal direction of flow is seen in the
portal vein. Right pleural effusion incidentally noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of cholecystitis.
2. Subtle hypoechoic lesion seen within the right lobe of the
liver without significant mass effect, possibly representing
focal fatty infiltration, hemangioma or FNH. Multiphasic MRI
(with "echo-offset" sequences) or CT is recommended for further
evaluation on a non-emergent basis.
3. Right pleural effusion.

***** [**2172-1-18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global biventricular systolic function. No pericardial effusion
or pathologic flow identified.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2171**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

***** [**1-25**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please perform w/ PO and IV contrast - hypoechoic liver lesion
on previous US [**2172-1-12**], now w/ elevated LFTs, fever
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Hypoechoic liver lesion on previous ultrasound and
elevated liver function tests.

COMPARISON: An ultrasound of the abdomen from [**2172-1-12**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial volumetric images have been obtained through
the abdomen and pelvis according to the triphasic liver
protocol. Pre-contrast, arterial face, portovenous phase images
were obtained.

FINDINGS: The liver appears normal with no evidence of abnormal
lesions corresponding to the son[**Name (NI) 493**] finding within the
right lobe. The spleen, the pancreas, and the gallbladder appear
unremarkable. The bilateral adrenal glands are within normal
limits. There is an NG tube in place with the tip seen within
the stomach.

The bowel appears unremarkable with no evidence of pneumatosis
or obstruction. There is no evidence of free fluid within the
abdomen. There is a Foley catheter in place.

There are bilateral basilar atelectases with consolidation in
the right lower lobe. There are also bilateral chest tubes in
place. There is a small right- sided pleural effusion. There is
a subcutaneous collection seen in the right hemithorax more
laterally on image 122 measuring 4.4 anteroposteriorly x 2.5 cm
axially. This collection is surrounded by fat stranding and
inflammatory changes.

There are no suspicious bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. There is no hepatic lesion detected that would correspond to
the ultrasonographic finding within the right lobe.

2. Bilateral lower lobe atelectases and conso
