Chief Complaint:
Transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] s/p Vtach/torsades [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 29185**]/arrest with
prolonged QT interval s/p admission to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital for
SOB/Cough/fever after witnessed aspiration event

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial line placement [**2109-7-21**]
Right internal jugular central line placement [**2109-7-21**]
cardiac catheterization with Left circumflex artery stent
placement [**2109-8-5**]


History of Present Illness:
79 y/o female with h/o bipolar disorder, paranoia, DM2, [**Hospital 2754**]
transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital after VT/VF arrest.
Defibrillated to NSR- SB (HR 30), later alternating between SR
and polymorphic VT, which required more shocks.  Pt given
magnesium, and amiodarone 150mg X2--amio gtt during code at
[**Hospital1 1474**].
Pt initally was admitted to OSH for fever/nonproductive
cough/increasing SOBX 2days.  Family reports witnessed
aspiration event at home.  CXR at OSH revealed aspiration PNA
and pt tx with Vancomycin and Gatifloxacin.  Pt reported CP this
AM and found to have EKG with anterior TWI.  Troponin 2.9/CK
250/MB 4.9 yesterday.  Pt started on Lovenox/plavix/ASA/BB.  Of
note, pt with report of interior/posterior MI on ECHO and
Myoview.  Pt seen by cardiologist at [**Hospital1 1474**], who offered cath,
but pt refused.  Psychiatry was consulted and deemed pt without
capacity to make medical decisions.  [**Name (NI) 1094**] HCP is her daughter,
and she would like cardiac cath to be done--plans made to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.  Prior to transfer, pt
sustained VT arrest.
--CCU resident over at [**Hospital1 1474**] said QT was normal "440".  Here,
QTc is 920 and was same before code.  TWI still present and are
diffuse may be ischemic but would also worry about head bleed
given delta MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] patient on lovenox.  Arrived with ETT
(intubated for airway protection).  EP notified.  Now febrile.
.
Of note, admission at [**Hospital1 1474**] 2 weeks ago for projectile
vomiting, nausea.  At this time, she was not taking lithium.
During this admission, she had a GI workup, with EGD on [**2109-7-9**]
showing a paraesophageal hernia (with almost [**1-24**] of her stomach
above the diaphragm) and hiatal hernia, with multiple
wide-mouthed duodenal diverticula.  It was felt that this large
paraesophageal hernia made it difficult for the pt to tol po,
including her lithium/meds.  Further workup was planned,
includeing 24 hour pH monitoring, and esophageal manometry to
study motility.  Her upper GI and barium swallow study showed
the type II paraesophageal herniaShe was offered a laparoscopic
paraesophageal hernia repair, but declined.  Her family felt
that this was due to a decline in mental capacity/decision
making given that she was not on her psych meds.

ECHO [**2109-7-22**]
1. The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. While views are limited, suspect overall left
ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. Resting regional wall
motion
abnormalities include mid and distal septal, inferior akinesis
with
inferolateral hypo/akinesis.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 5.The mitral valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.

Changes and/or ischemia or central nervous system event disease

.
CXR [**2109-8-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Continued right upper lobe consolidation and bibasilar
opacities, with slight improvement in aeration of the right
upper lobe.
2. No definite evidence of congestive heart failure.
.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION WITH STENT PLACEMENT [**2109-8-5**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal left and right sided filling pressures. Mild pulmonary

hypertension.
3. Mild LV systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 42%.
4. Successful placement of drug-eluting stent in proximal LCx.
5. Successful balloon angioplasty of distal LCx.
6. Successful placement of Angioseal in right femoral
arteriotomy.
.
ECHO [**2109-8-6**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokineisis and
infero-lateral akinesis/dyskinesis. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-23**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2109-7-22**], the overall LVEF has improved while the
degree of mitral regurgitation detected has increased (intrinsic
LVEF may be less given the severity of mitral regurgitation).
The degree of pulmonary hypertension is similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
Impression:
79 y/o woman s/p Vtach/torsades arrest with prolonged QT,
elevated troponins.
1.  Coronary:
Pt has a history of coronary ds based on EKG findings, who
presented to an OSH with elevated troponins, and report of
inferior posterior MI on Myoview.  We continued
ASA/plavix/statin throughout her stay.  We initially held beta
blocker given her low BP and HR, however this was re-introduced
when tolerated.  We did not feel the need for cath emergently,
as pt's inferior posterior MI was nonacute in nature, was noted
hypokinesis/akinesis of inferior segment on echo per OSH records
2 weeks ago.  Pt likely went into torsades from prolonged QT,
superimposed on prior MI.  She went for cardiac catheterization
on [**2109-8-5**], with successfull placement of a stent in her LCX
artery.  Her post-cath echo demonstrated an EF of 35-40%, and
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior hypokineisis and infero-lateral akinesis/dyskinesis.
