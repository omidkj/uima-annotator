Pertinent Results:
[**2121-1-8**] CXR: Increased left basal and mid lung opacity, likely a
combination of a small pleural effusion and a new lingular
consolidation. There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral fibrotic
changes in the apices, more evident on the right, unchanged. The
patient is status post CABG and AVR, with normal post-operatory
cardiac mediastinal silhouette. The mediastinal wires and
prosthetic aortic valve are intact.
[**2121-1-2**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium or right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. POST
CPB: 1. Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventyricular systolci fuunction. 2. A
bio-prosthesis is visualized in the aortic position, well seated
and stable, good leafflet excursion. 3. Peak trans-aortic
valvular gradient is 11 mm Hg. 4. No other change
[**2121-1-1**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA with no stenosis. Left ICA
stenosis 40-59%.
[**2121-1-1**] Chest CT: 1. While there is biapical scarring, much more
pronounced on the right, indicative of previous tuberculosis,
there is also multifocal infiltration in both upper lobes, on
the right in the posterior segment, remote from the apical
scarring, and there is also bronchiolitis and peribronchial
inflammation in the lingula and right upper lobe anterior
segment, respectively. All this points to the need to exclude
active mycobacterial tuberculosis as well as non-tuberculous
mycobacteria and in the case of the more consolidative
abnormality, active bacterial pneumonia. 2. Moderately-severe
emphysema. 3. Severe aortic valvular and atherosclerotic
coronary calcification. 4. Small hiatus hernia. 5. Mild
narrowing, right upper lobe bronchus attributable to anatomic
distortion because of upper lobe retraction.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] following his cardiac cath
which revealed severe 3 vessel disease. In addition he had
severe aortic stenosis. He was appropriately medically managed
and work-up for cardiac surgery. Which included usual lab work,
carotid U/S, Echo and Chest CT. On [**1-2**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 3 and aortic valve replacement. Please see operative note for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] was placed in isolation room d/t
findings on x-ray/chest ct which were concerning for TB. His
sputum was cultured for AFB. Eventually the findings were found
to be old (on previous x-rays for approximately last 10 years)
and he had three negative AFB samples. Also during his post-op
course he had multiple episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation. He
was appropriately treated and was discharged in sinus rhythm
with Amiodarone and Coumadin. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing
wires were removed per protocol. He was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further care on post-op day 5. On post-op
day 6 there appeared to be a new left lung consolidation and he
was started on antibiotics. On post-op day 7 he was doing well
and discharged to rehab for further care. He will continue
antibiotics for a total of 14 days.
