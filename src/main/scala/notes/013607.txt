HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine
Service for further workup and evaluation.  The patient had
cardiac catheterization on [**2174-7-26**] which showed left
anterior descending, long diffuse 80% lesion extending to the
ostium, left circumflex 90% bifurcation lesion in the obtuse
marginal, right coronary artery small with moderate disease.
Cardiac Surgery was consulted and the patient was a good
candidate for coronary artery bypass graft.  The patient was
taken to the Operating Room on [**2174-7-27**] where coronary
artery bypass graft times three with left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft
to obtuse marginal and bifurcation times two was performed
without complication.  The chest tube and pacing wires were
placed intraoperatively.  The patient was transferred to the
CSC Unit in stable condition.  On postoperative day #1, the
patient is afebrile, vital signs are stable but we were
unable to wean the patient off of the ventilator because of
agitation and increased respiratory rate when we tried to do
that.  On postoperative day #2 the patient is p.o. feeding
9.3, he was started on Levofloxacin and he was extubated
successfully.  He started working with physical therapy.  His
chest tube was removed without complications.  On
postoperative day #3 the patient is afebrile, the vital signs
are stable.  On postoperative day #4 the patient is afebrile
and vital signs are stable.  There were no concerns.  On
postoperative day #5 there were no acute changes.  His
heartrate was stable on Lopressor.  He was transferred to the
floor in stable condition.  On postoperative day #6 the
patient had p.o. of 100.7 which decreased with coughing and
incentive spirometry.  The patient continued on Levofloxacin
and ambulated with physical therapy.  On postoperative day #7
the patient finished his physical therapy and he was
medically stable.  He was discharged home in stable
condition.
