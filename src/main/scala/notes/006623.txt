Bradycardia and hypotension

History of Present Illness:
82 yo woman w/ h/o CAD s/p CABGx4 on [**2184-1-5**] (LIMA-LAD,
SVG-Diag, SVG-OM, SVG-PDA), DM, HTN, h/o myelodisplastic
syndrome, and AAA (7 x 6.7 x 9.7cm, s/p hip repair in [**11-12**]
scheduled for repair with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2184-2-18**]), who was
referred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with bradycardia and hypotension from
[**Name8 (MD) 11851**] RN staaff. She also complained of "quesiness." Per the
patient, she has been unable to eat for the past 2 days because
of epigastric burning as well as a bitter taste in her mouth. 3
days ago, the patient also had 2 episodes of emesis. She denied
any fevers, chills, night sweats, diarrhea, constipation,
dysuria, cough. On cardiac review, denied CP, SOB, LE edema,
palpitations.

At [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**], she was noted to have bradycardia to the 30s,
but her BP was good to the 140s. She had ARF (Cr @ 2.2 - up from
1.3 on [**2184-1-28**]) and hyperkalemia 5.9. She also had guaiac pos
brown stool, anemia (seems to be her baseline ~ 27). Bedside u/s
shows AAA 6 x 5.6cm.  Given kayexalate, Ca gluconate, D50, NS x
1L, atropine 0.25 x 3 (with improvement of BP), ASA 81mg x 2,
Zofran 4mg x 1, morphine 2mg x 2.

In the ED: Continued sinus bradycardia to the 40s, SBP
mid90's-100s. EP consulted. EKG was faxed to EP fellow, thought
to have shows sinus conduction, but ?sinus arrest with escape
rhythm, so started on dopamine gtt--with improvement of SBP to
110s and HR to 70s. No central line given hemodynamic stability
and desire to preserve site for ?pacer. At [**Hospital1 18**], given more
kayexalate: K5.5->5.3, 1L NS, zofran and morphine.

Past Medical History:
1. Left femoral neck fracture status post hemiarthroplasty on
[**2183-11-20**].
2. Myelodysplastic syndrome requiring packed red blood cell and
platelet transfusion.
3. Diabetes.
4. Hypertension.
5. AAA -- infrarenal

Cardiac Risk Factors: + Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension

.
Cardiac History: CABG, in [**2184-1-5**] anatomy as follows:
(LIMA-LAD, SVG-Diag, SVG-OM, SVG-PDA)
.
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2184-1-2**] anatomy as
follows: 70% distal LMCA stenosis, LAD with 90% ostial LAD
stenosis and an ostial 90% lesion of a small D1, LCx with 50%
ostial stenosis, RCA RCA had diffuse <50% disease with an 80%
ostial PDA stenosis.
.
Pacemaker/ICD: NA


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse. She is married, does
not smoke cigarettes. Does not do any regular exercise or follow
a particular diet.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.


Physical Exam:
AFVSS
Gen: Elderly female AAO x 3 alert and communicating
appropriately.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple without JVD
CV: +S1, +S2. No murmurs.
Chest: Emaciated. Midline sternotomy scar well healed.
Abd: Soft. Mild distension. No rebound or guarding. No HSM or
tenderness.  Abd aorta not palpated. No abdominal bruits.
Ext: No c/c/e. feet are warm with dopplerable pulses.


Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated:
Sinus @ 62 with IVCD, normal axis. Intervals preserved; ,maybe
slight Qt prolongation. This was on dopamine.

TELEMETRY demonstrated: Sinus brady at 53

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2184-1-2**] (preop) demonstrated:
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the septum and anterior walls. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Mild pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-1-15**],
the septal and anterior wall motion abnormalities are more
pronounced and the severity of mitral regurgitation has
increased.

[**2184-2-4**] ABD/PELVIS CT:
1.  Slightly increased size of massive infrarenal AAA, now
measuring 7 x 7 cm, increased from 6.7 x 6.6 cm.  No periaortic
stranding or fluid to suggest rupture at this time.  High
density along the anterior thrombus is roughly stable from prior
exam and may represent calcification within intramural
hemorrhage.
2.  Previously seen pseudoaneurysm associated with left hip
prosthesis is not evaluated due to metallic artifact.
3.  New moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions.
4.  Cholelithiasis within a distended gallbladder, however, no
surrounding
stranding to suggest cholecystitis.  Recommend correlation with
clinical
symptoms.
5.  Diverticulosis.
