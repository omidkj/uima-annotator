CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. [**Known lastname 12982**] is a 53-year-old man, sent to
the [**Hospital1 **] from his primary care provider's office following
a visit to evaluate new onset chest pain and shortness of
breath.  The patient was referred from the [**Hospital **] Hospital
to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization.  He is a direct admission to the cath lab.
Please see cath report for full details.

In summary the patient had left main and three vessel disease
with subtotally occluded left main, partially occluded LAD, a
subtotally occluded left circumflex and a 70 percent RCA with
an EF of 20 to 25 percent.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old
man, emergent CABG, referred from [**Hospital **] Hospital, new onset
chest pain that began two days prior to admission associated
with jaw clenching and shortness of breath.  The patient also
noticed pedal edema at that time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for GERD, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and ganglion cyst excision from the
neck.

MEDS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Protonix 40 b.i.d. and Lipitor 20
every day.

The patient states no known drug allergies.

He has a 30 pack year history of tobacco use and denies
alcohol use for the past eight years.

Weight is 190 pounds, height 5 feet 8 inches.

LABORATORY DATA:  In the cath lab potassium was 3.7, BUN 14,
creatinine 1.2, hematocrit 48.8 with platelets 255,000.  PT
12.5, PTT 30.7, INR 1.7 with a CK of 7.7.  EKG shows ST
elevations in V1 through V3. Chest x-ray shows bilateral
pleural effusions with some pulmonary congestion.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  In general the patient was on the cath table,
undergoing a procedure.  History via cardiology fellow.
Neurologically alert and oriented x3.  Respiratory showed
decreased breath sounds in the bases.  Cardiovascular showed
regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities were warm and well perfused, right
groin with balloon pump in place.

Following cardiac cath CT surgery was consulted and the
patient was brought emergently to the Operating Room for
coronary artery bypass grafting.  Please see the OR report
for full details.  In summary the patient had a CABG x3 with
LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM, and saphenous
vein graft to PDA.  His bypass time was 59 minutes with a
crossclamp time of 44 minutes.  He tolerated the operation
well and was transferred from the Operating Room to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

At the time of transfer the patient had epinephrine at 0.4
mcg per kilogram per minute, insulin infusion, Levophed at
0.5 mcg per kilogram per minute, milrinone at 0.25 mcg per
kilogram per minute, Neo-Synephrine at 3.2 mcg per kilogram
per minute and propofol at 50 mcg per kilogram per minute as
well as an intra-aortic balloon pump at 1:1.

In the immediate postoperative period the patient had
difficulty with postoperative bleeding.  This was felt to be
due to the Plavix as well as the Aggrastat the patient was
receiving during his cardiac catheterization.  This was
reversed with blood products and the patient also received
several units of packed red blood cells.

On postoperative day one the patient was somewhat more
hemodynamically stable.  We were able to wean off his
epinephrine drip.  Additionally, the patient was weaned from
his propofol and his Neo-Synephrine drips and ultimately, by
the end of the day, was weaned from the ventilator and
successfully extubated.  The patient remained hemodynamically
stable throughout all these maneuvers.

On postoperative day two the patient continued to be
hemodynamically stable.  His intra-aortic balloon pump was
successfully weaned and thus removed, following which the
patient was weaned from his Neo-Synephrine drip.  During the
night of postoperative day two he was also weaned from his
milrinone infusion.

On postoperative day three the patient continued to do
extremely well.  His milrinone was discontinued.  His Swan-
Ganz catheter was removed and he was transferred to the floor
for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Once on the floor the patient had an uneventful hospital
course.  His activity level was increased with the assistance
of the nursing staff as well as physical therapy staff.

On postoperative day six it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready to be discharged home.

At the time of this dictation the patient's physical exam is
as follows:  Temperature 99.5, heart rate 88 sinus rhythm,
blood pressure 100/69, respiratory rate 20.  O2 sat is 100
percent on room air.  Weight preoperatively was 80 kg, at
discharge 88.2 kg.

Lab data shows hematocrit 35, sodium 138, potassium 3.6,
chloride 102, CO2 28, BUN 24, creatinine 0.8, glucose 141.

Physical exam shows neurologically alert and oriented x3.
Moves all extremities.  Follows commands.  Nonfocal exam.
Pulmonary clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac shows
regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2.  Sternum is stable.
Incision has Steri-Strips without drainage or erythema.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm and well perfused with
trace edema.  Left leg incision has Steri-Strips, open to
air, clean and dry.  No erythema or drainage.

The patient is to be discharged home with visiting nurses.
He is to have follow-up in the [**Hospital 409**] Clinic in two weeks.
Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two to three weeks, follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in four weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
   bypass grafting times three with left internal mammary
   artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein
   graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the
   posterior descending coronary artery.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Congestive heart failure.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions.

Condition at the time of discharge is good.

1. Carvedilol 3.125 mg b.i.d.
2. Potassium chloride 20 mEq q. 12 hours for two weeks.
3. Aspirin 81 mg every day.
4. Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets q. four to six hours
   p.r.n.
5. Protonix 40 mg every day.
6. Lipitor 20 mg every day.
7. Amiodarone 400 mg b.i.d. times one week then 400 mg every
   day times one week then 200 mg every day.
