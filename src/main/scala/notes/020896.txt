Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
diastolic heart failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Picc Line placement

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 80 yo man with h/o severe diastolic CHF, h/o
hemorrhagic pleural effusion s/p pleuridesis in [**2178**], initially
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] to thoracics team at [**Hospital1 18**] for
empyema, now transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 service for CHF.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2182-12-10**] w/ c/o
SOB, at which time history, physical, and imaging studies
demonstrated that the patient had had a superficial furuncle
that had invaded the chest wall and created an infection/empyema
in the pleural space. He was initiated on vancomycin and zosyn
and transferred to the thoracics team here at [**Hospital1 18**] for
debridement. Patient underwent surgical debridement of the
empyema on [**2182-12-14**], where 2 ribs were resected to obtain exposure
to the infection (s/p modified Eloesser flap [**12-15**]) - cultures
grew rare Group B beta strep. Patient was transferred to unasyn
on [**2182-12-18**] to complete a total 2 week course of antibiotics (10
days from [**2182-12-18**]).
During hosptial course, patient has become progressively volume
overloaded, with a weight gain on transfer from [**Hospital1 18**] from dry
weight of 74.5kg to 81.8kg. He has become extremely edematous
with skin weeping. The patient has been diuresed 2L/day for the
past couple of days, responding to 80mg IV lasix. Per the
patient, he had begug gaining weight prior to his presentation
to [**Hospital3 **] on [**12-10**].
Due to his congestive heart failure/volume overload, the patient
is being transferred to the CHF service with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] as
the attending.

.
ECG:Atrial fibrillation
Extensive ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia
Since previous tracing, heart rate decreased
.
[**2183-1-1**] renal US:
No evidence of any hydronephrosis. Right kidney is smaller than
the left kidney but this may be due to technical difficulties in
obtaining accurate measurements.
.
Bronchial washings: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

  Bronchial cells, and numerous neutrophils and lymphocytes.
.
CT chest: IMPRESSION:
1. High density tract which appears to connect the skin surface
to the pleura between the 6th and 7th left lateral ribs.
2. Stable size of a loculated hyperdense left pleural effusion.
3. Stable appearance of multiple bilateral parenchymal opacities
likely related to prior surgery and parenchymal hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 80 yo man with diastolic CHF, constrictive
pericarditis, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and a history of
pulmonary hemorrhage.  He presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 **] with empyema and underwent Modified Eloesser flap and 2
rib thoracoplasty ([**12-15**]) for Empyema necessitans by thoracic
surgery. He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 for
management of what turned out to be severe CHF exacerbation.  He
had a complex course.  He was initially difficult to diurese for
a week  diuresis attempts with lasix and metolazone along with
captopril proved unsuccessful.  The pt had severe scrotal edema
and significant lower extremity edema.  His respiratory status
was tenuous at times.  At the same time he was likely
intravascularly depleted.  Renal service was consulted and they
recommended  lasix drip and discontinuation of .  The patient
was also noted to be hypoalbuminemic so they recommended
albumin.  The patient's blood pressure could not tolerate the
drip.  The pt's edema and resp status was not improving
Throughout this time the
