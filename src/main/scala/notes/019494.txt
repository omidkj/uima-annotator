HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  RESPIRATORY:  [**Known lastname **] was intubated in the delivery
    room for management of respiratory distress syndrome.
    She received a total of 1 dose of surfactant therapy.  On
    day of life #2, presented with pulmonary hemorrhage
    prompting transition to high-frequency ventilation.  She
    later transitioned off, back to conventional ventilation.
    On day of life #7, transitioned to CPAP.  She was
    intubated on day of life #11 for increasing spells.  On
    [**12-30**], the infant noted to have increasing needs for
    suctioning and copious amounts of endotracheal
    secretions.  A tracheal aspirate was sent and was positive
    for staph aureus.  She was treated for 14 days with
    oxacillin.  Attempted extubation on day of life #29
    ([**2125-1-9**]).  Extubation attempt failed due to
    increased work of breathing and stridor.  The infant was
    given racemic epinephrine and steroids in the hope to
    continue CPAP, but the infant continued to deteriorate -
    prompting reintubation.  At that time, ORL from
    [**Hospital3 1810**] was consulted, and it was
    recommended a rigid bronch once the infant reached 2
    kilos.  The infant was maintained on minimal support of
    16/5 with a rate of 14 in room air.  On [**2125-1-26**]
    she self-extubated, but had to be immediately reintubated
    due to stridor and increased work of breathing.  On
    [**2125-2-1**], she self-extubated and again failed to
    stay extubated despite racemic epinephrine and steroids.
    She received 3 doses of Decadron 0.5 mg IV q.12h., which
    were discontinued on [**2125-1-2**], at 3:00 p.m.  The
    infant is currently on 16/5 with a rate of 14 in room
    air.  She is receiving caffeine citrate for management of
    apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.  She is receiving
    11 mg PG q.24h. at noon.  She is currently scheduled for
    a rigid bronch on [**2125-2-6**], at 10:00 a.m.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  [**Known lastname **] is status post indomethacin
    therapy on [**12-13**] for presumed patent ductus
    arteriosus following a pulmonary hemorrhage.
    Echocardiogram on [**12-20**] revealed no patent ductus
    arteriosus.  The infant is currently stable with no
    audible murmur.  Heart rates range 140s to 180s with
    blood pressures 83/43 with a mean of 56.

3.  FLUIDS AND ELECTROLYTES:  Her birth weight was 971 grams.
    Her length was 34.5 cm.  Her head circumference was 25.5
    cm.  Her discharge weight is 2105 grams, head
    circumference 31cm, length 45cm.  She was initially
    started on 100 cc/kg/day of parenteral nutrition.
    Enteral feedings were initiated on day of life #6.  She
    achieved full enteral feedings by day of life #15.  Her
    max enteral intake was 150 cc/kg/day of breast milk 30
    calories with added Beneprotein.  She is currently
    receiving 130 cc/kg/day of breast milk 26 calories with
    Beneprotein.  She is being fluid restricted for her
    respiratory status.  Her most recent set of laboratory
    results on [**2125-1-23**]:  She had a sodium of 135,
    potassium of 4.6, chloride of 101, total CO2 of 28,
    calcium of 10.1, phos of 5.7, alkaline phosphatase of
    268.  On [**2125-1-29**], she had a complete blood count
    of a white count of 11.7, hematocrit of 30.1, platelets
    205, 36 polys, 1 band, 40 lymphs.  On [**1-28**], her
    gentamicin dose pre was less than 0.3, and her post was
    5.9.

4.  GI:  Resolved hyperbilirubinemia on [**2124-12-26**].  Her
    peak bilirubin was 5.6/0.3.  She was treated with

    were benign.  The infant received 48 hours of ampicillin
    and gentamicin.  On [**2124-12-30**], the infant presented
    with increasing secretions.  A trache aspirate was
    obtained and later cultured staph aureus and klebsiella.
    The infant was treated for a total of 14 days with
    oxacillin dor the staph aureus.  Oxacillin was
    discontinued on [**1-13**].  On [**1-24**], the infant

    aspirate was obtained at that time, which later cultured
    foe Staph aureus and Klebsiella.  The infant completed a 2
    week course of oxacillin, last dose on [**2-5**].  For
    Klebsiella coverage she is receiving gentamicin and
    cefotaxime for a total of 14 days, which should be
    discontinued on [**2125-2-8**].
