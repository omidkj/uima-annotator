Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted on [**11-12**] with a GI bleed.  Pt was evaluated by
GI.  The pt was prepped with golytely and a colonoscopy was
performed.  Two polyps were found, one of which was hemorrhagic
in the sigmoid.  The decision was made to perform a
sigmoidoscopy one the patient was extubated.

The patient was also evaluated by interventional pulmonology for
tracheal stent placement.  Ms. [**Known lastname 42290**] had a history of
tracheoesophageal fistula.  The decision was made to perform a
rigid bronchoscopy and to place a stent so that she could be
extubated.

In the OR, a large defect in her trachea was visualized.  Four
stents were placed.  Because of the extent of her repair, it was
recommended that she should not be re-intubated.  After a
discussion with the family about her overall prognosis, the
patient was made DNR/DNI.

On [**11-16**] the patient was extubated.  She was extremely
uncomfortable with respiratory rate in the 30's.  After another
discussion with her family, the decision to place the patient on
comfort measures only. A morphine drip was started and titrated
to comfort.  On [**11-18**] at around 6am the patient expired.  The
family was notified.
