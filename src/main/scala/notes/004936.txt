Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
fatigue, weight gain, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CVVH line inserted

[**Hospital1 **]-Ventricular pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
60 year old man CAD s/p MI s/p CABG and PCI to LCx, HL, DM,
homograph AVR in [**2097**] for aortic stenosis,  Afib s/p pacemaker ,
MS and AS, with a recent admit [**2-8**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for CHF
exacerbation. He was diuresed, started on ACEI and discharged
home. He comes in today with increasing SOB and leg swelling. He
says he has gained abt 12 lbs in last 2 weeks. Also c/o extreme
fatigue. Hence he went to see Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] today. In his office
his SBP was in 70s. Hence he was sent to the ER. In the ER his
SBP was in 70s. Hence a CVL (Cordis) was placed and subsequently
was admitted to the CCU.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

EKG was a paced and v sensed.

RENAL ULTRASOUND ([**2112-3-18**]): The right kidney measures 10.7 cm,
the left 10.9 cm. There is no hydronephrosis or stone. There is
a simple cyst at the lower pole of the left kidney, measuring
1.5 x 1.9 x 1.9cm. There is a left pleural effusion. There has
been prior splenectomy with probable splenule in the splenectomy
bed. Limited views of the liver are unremarkable. DOPPLERS:
There is brisk systolic waveform in the right main as well as
the proximal, mid and lower pole renal arteries. However,
although the resistive indicex is normal in the main renal
artery on the right, resistive indices range from 0.9 to 1
within the intraparenchymal arteries, with absent diastolic
flow. On the left, there is a tardus parvus waveform, and absent
diastolic flow in the main renal artery, with elevated resistive
index. Within the kidney there is not clear diastolic flow.
IMPRESSION: Delayed time to peak systole in the LRA suggestive
of stenosis on the keft. Bilateral markedly elevated RIs (
0.9-1.0 ) may indicate diffuse parenchymal disease bilaterally.
.
ECHO ([**3-25**]): The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. The LV ejection fraction (approximately
40 percent) appears mildly-to-moderately depressed secondaey to
inferior posterior hypokinesis (basal segments akinetic). There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
valve appears to be a homograft. The prosthetic aortic valve
leaflets are thickened. The transaortic gradient is higher than
expected for this type of prosthesis. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. The left ventricular pre-ejection delay (110 msec) and
the interventricular ejection delay (30-40 msec) are now normal.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2112-2-26**], the left ventricular ejection fraction and
stroke volume are increased. The aortic valve effective orifice
area may also be increased. All measures of intraventricular
left ventricular dyssynchrny are reduced.
.
Chest X-ray ([**3-25**]): Since [**3-17**], the right axillary pacemaker
has been changed or revised. One lead is not connected. New left
ventricular lead follows its expected course. Three other leads
have not changed in their respective positions since [**3-17**],
including one ending in standard position in the right atrium,
another in the right ventricle, and a second ending at the
origin of the right ventricular outflow tract. Mild pulmonary
edema and small right pleural effusion are unchanged since [**3-17**]. Heart size is normal. Right internal jugular sheath ends
above the junction with the left brachiocephalic vein.  Lower
sternal wires are intact. The upper sternal wires are
fragmented, as before, and there is suggestion of some widening
of the upper aspect of the sternotomy. I doubt that there is any
pneumothorax.
