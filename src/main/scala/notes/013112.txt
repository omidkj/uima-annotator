CT abd [**8-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver without focal hepatic
mass.
2. Small-to-moderate amount of ascites.
3. Two, tiny non-obstructing renal calculi within both kidneys.

4. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
5. Cardiomegaly with distension of the hepatic veins suggestive
of
cardiomyopathy.
6. No intra-abdominal tumor identified.
.
Liver US [**8-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of the liver and gallbladder compared to
the previous day's CT.
2. No biliary ductal dilatation.
3. Marked distention of the IVC and hepatic veins consistent
with right heart failure.
4. Stable appearance of the nondistended gallbladder with
thickened wall, cholelithiasis, and adenomyomatosis.
5. Ascites.
.
Echo:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed.
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is severe
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
.
Liver US [**8-23**]:
1.  Hepatic veins and IVC are patent without evidence of
thrombosis.  Marked distention of these vessels is considered
most likely due to right heart failure.
2.  Expected pneumobilia in the setting of recent ERCP.
.
ERCP [**8-22**]:
1. Localized erythema of the mucosa was noted in the antrum and
stomach body. These findings are compatible with gastritis.
2. Two superficial erosions with overlying exudates and
surrounding erythema were noted in the duodenal bulb. Cold
forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the dudoenal
bulb.
3. Cannulation of the biliary duct was initally unsuccessful
with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Subsequently
a small sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position
using a needle-knife to help guide bile duct cannulation.
Thereafter, deep cannulation of the CBD was successfully
achieved using a sphincterotome.
4. Cholangiogram showed a single irregular stone in the distal
CBD. No proximal dilation was noted.
5. To help faciliate stone extraction, the sphincterotomy was
gently extended in the 12 o'clock position using a
sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
6. A 12mm balloon was then used to sweep the CBD with sucessful
extrusion of sludge and bile. Although post sweep cholangiogram
did not show evidence of residual stones, it is possible that
some framgents may have been left behind.
7. To assist sluge and stone fragment drainage, a 7cm by 10Fr
Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfully in the CBD.
Clear bile was noted to flow from the site.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 76 year old male w/CAD s/p CABG (EF 18%) who
presented with 50 lb wt loss x 4 weeks and jaundice. Prior to
admission the patient had mild dull, intermittent, lower
quadrant abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, and intermittent
nausea with emesis (brown) for the prior 4 weeks. Neither nausea
or abdominal pain was related to food, and no ETOH or NSAID use
recently. No fevers, chills, night sweats, melena, hematochezia,
dysphagia. When the patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] and was found to
have elevated LFT's with bilirubin of 21. He underwent ERCP s/p
small stone extraction, sphincterotomy, and stent placement on
[**8-22**].
.
Subsequently on the floor the patient became hypotensive with
SBP's in the 80-90's (baseline 110's on valsartan, BB, imdur)
which responded poorly to gentle fluid boluses and holding of
his antihypertensives. He also was noted to have a rising BUN
and dropping HCT (45.4 on [**8-21**].8 on [**8-23**].2 on [**8-28**], and
30 s/p 1 unit RPBC's on [**8-29**]) with guaic positive stools and
dark stools. He also had an increased WBC from 3.2 on admission
to 6.6. Additionally, the patient had a mild amount of ascites
on ultrasound but radiology did not feel that there was an
adequate amount to tap. In concern for SBP, he was started on
flagyl and ceftriaxone, although it is unclear if he recieved
these meds d/t lack of IV access. He was ordered 2 units PRBC's
prior to transfer, one of which he recieved prior to arriving in
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
He was admitted to the ICU for management of hypotension and ?GI
bleed.  Repeat EGD did not show any evidence of active bleeding.
Housestaff and attendings had many conversations both with the
patient and with his health care proxy, and decided given the
patients underlying co-morbidities and preferences, that he be
made DNR/DNI/CMO. The son/patient requested no blood draws, no
more fluids, no more antibiotics, no more invasive monitoring.
He was transfered back out to the floor and was noted to be
intermittently delerious.  He recieved Zyprexa qhs and TID prn
with good effect.  He was subsequently transferred to rehab for
comfort care.
