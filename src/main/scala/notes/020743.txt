[**2164-6-17**] CT C spine :
1. No definite evidence of cervical spine fracture or
subluxation.
2. Right apical pneumothorax and posterior pulmonary contusion.

3. Status post intubation with moderate amount of oropharyngeal
and
nasopharyngeal fluid. A feeding tube is also in place.
4. Trace fluid in the right maxillary sinus.

[**2164-6-17**] Head CT :
1. Minimally depressed, mildly comminuted left nasal bone
fracture.
2. Non-displaced bilateral multiple superior orbital wall
fractures.
3. Large right frontal and moderate left preseptal subgaleal
hematoma.
4. Equivocal 5 mm left frontal subdural hematoma adjacent to a
nondisplaced left frontal bone fracture.

[**2164-6-17**] CT Torso :
1. Right hepatic and right renal lacerations without definite
evidence of
active extravasation. Subcapsular hepatic hematoma.
2. Moderate right pneumothorax. Right posterior pulmonary
contusion and
atelectasis. Nondisplaced right posterior first, third and
fourth rib
fractures. Mildly displaced right posterior fifth rib fracture.
3. Right adrenal hemorrhage.

[**2164-6-17**] Bilat. hands :
Possible foreign body adjacent to the right humeral surgical
neck. Mild right acromioclavicular joint widening.

[**2164-6-17**] Right renal artery and hepatic artery A gram ;
Selective right renal and right common hepatic arteriograms and
abdominal aortogram were performed. Contour abnormality in
keeping with known perinephric and perihepatic hematomas and
laceration but no evidence of contrast extravasation.

[**2164-6-25**] TEE :
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Mild
pulmonary artery hypertension

[**2164-6-30**] CT Chest/Abd :
1. Findings suggestive of organizing hematoma right lobe of
liver.
2. Inflammatory changes right groin and small collection in
right labia may be post-traumatic. Clinical correlation
recommended.
3. Other, posttraumatic findings including multiple right-sided
rib
fractures, right adrenal hematoma and right renal laceration are
unchanged
from prior with interval resolution of right pneumothorax.



Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro:
- R frontal bone fracture, multiple lacerations to head
- neurosurgery followe, the recs: NTD for right frontal bone
fracture, no significant underlying intracranial injury,
recommend dilantin load 1g and 100mg TID x10d
- Head lacerations washed out and sutured/stapled - remove
sutures [**6-24**]
- Sedation/Pain: fent/versed

Cardiovascular:
- no underlying issues
- One episode of hypotension [**6-17**] with improvement after
responded 1 uPRBC and 1L LR. Patient had angiography to rule out
active extravasation in the adrenals.
CTA was done for fx of left lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus
involving the carotid groove, there was no vascular injury.
Patient experienced transient tachycardia likely from
hypovolemia and pain. She improvement with fluid boluses and
pain control.

Pulmonary:
- R apical ptx, R 3rd-5th posterior rib fxs, posterior pulmonary
contusion, follow with serial CXRs
Intubated on arrival.

Gastrointestinal / Abdomen:
- Grade 5 liver laceration s/p angio [**6-17**] without active
extravasation demonstrated. Patient was on bedrest for 5 days.


Nutrition:
- TF were initiated on HD 2: Isosource 1.5, goal 20 ml/hour +14g
Beneprotein (770 calories and 45g protein). They were adjustment
once off propofol.

Renal:
- R renal grade III vs grade IV laceration with subcapsular
hematoma, no hematuria
- Urology recs: monitor hcts and Cr, keep foley for now, rpt CT
in [**1-22**] weeks to document resolving hematoma
She had Foley for urine output monitoring.
Recuscitation per burn protocol.

Hematology:
Patient's hemtocrit was monitred q8h. She recieved transfuse as
needed for goal hct > 30
- hct trending down, given 2 units PRBC, repeat post transfusion
hct
- Boots only
- Hold SQH

Endocrine:
- RISS for goal BS < 150
Infectious Disease:
- on clindamycin for prophylaxis x48hrs
- low grade temperatures
- Will monitor WBC and fever curves

MSK:
- Road rash and burns to hands L>R, R shoulder to elbow, L>R
thigh singed eyebrows, no inhalational injury on bronch
- L knee and R shoulder with deeper wounds, consider debridement

- ACS to treat burns with antibiotic ointment and xeroform,
dressing change [**Hospital1 **]
- Plastics to manage facial fractures and facial burns
- R 5th finger laceration ?????? sutured, plastics clinic in 2 weeks
to remove sutures
- Opthomology to be called when patient able to follow commands


Following transfer to the Trauma floor she continued to improve.
 She was evaluated on many occasions by the Physical and
Occupational Therapy services.  She was gradually able to
ambulate independently. Her brief cognitive exam demonstrated
some difficulty with recall and a follow up appointment with
Cognitive Neurology was recommended.  She had no gross
neurologic deficits and completed a course of prophylactic
Dilantin without side effects.

Her hematocrit remained stable as did her vital signs.  Prior to
transfer from the ICU she was treated with a course of
antibiotics for an E Coli pneumonia.  Her WBC gradually declined
from the 20K range to 15K on [**2164-7-3**] and she remained afebrile.
She had no sputum production and was encouraged to continue use
of her incentive spirometer in light of her rib fractures.
