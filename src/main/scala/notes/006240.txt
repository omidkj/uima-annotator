mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old man with history of likely pancreatic
malignancy who was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with
abdominal pain and rising bilirubin for ERCP evaluation. At
[**Hospital1 **], he had worsening abdominal pain, and he was noted to
have a rising bilirubin. ERCP/stenting cannot be performed at
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was transferred here for urgent evaluation and
stenting.

In the ED, he was given vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
He was seen by surgery, who reiterated that he is not a surgical
candidate. On arrival he was confused, and his mental status
deteriorated, and he was intubated. He received a total of 7L
normal saline. Dopamine was started for BP 58/38 (which
decreased to 46/25), and norepinephrine was added after a right
IJ triple lumen was placed. A foley was placed and he was sent
to the ICU. He received a total of 7L normal saline in the ED.

In the ICU, he was seen by the ERCP team, who emergently
performed an ERCP, discovering a blocked CBD stent with frank
pus and placed a new stent within the blocked stent.

ABG on admission: 7.13/46/113/16
.
MICROBIOLOGY:
Blood cultures grew Klebsiella and then later Enterococcus
faecium
.
IMAGING/REPORTS:
.
[**2143-10-8**] CBD brushings/cytology: no evidence of malignant cells.
.
Echo [**2143-10-10**]: Preserved global left ventricular systolic
function. Right ventricle appears dilated with probable RV
systolic dysfunction. Mildly dilated thoracic aorta. Limited
study.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 107bpm. Q in III. Normal axis, normal
intervals. Wavy baseline. TWF in V1-V3.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2143-10-8**]: 1.  3.5 x 3.5 cm mass in the head of the
pancreas concerning for malignancy. There is approximately 50%
involvement of the SMV circumference. 2.  Fatty liver without
evidence of focal lesion.
.
CXR [**2143-11-22**]: 1.  Tip of the endotracheal tube is 2 cm from the
carina and may be withdrawn approximately 2 cm for standard
positioning. 2.  Apparent widening of the cardiomediastinum
likely secondary to rotation, and can be reassessed once repeat
radiographs are obtained following ET tube repositioning. 3.  No
acute process identified.
.
CXR [**2143-11-22**] (line placement): 1.  Right IJ in cavoatrial
junction.
2.  Otherwise, no change since one hour ago.

Liver US [**11-24**]:
The liver displays no focal masses and unremarkable parenchyma.
Again identified is mild prominence to the extra- hepatic
biliary system measuring approximately 6 mm and large amount of
sludge within the gallbladder. Portal vein is patent with normal
hepatopetal flow. Of note, the recently placed CBD stents were
unable to be visualized by ultrasound.

Non-contrast CT Head [**12-3**]:
Limited study. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Old lacunar infarct. Please note that MRI is more sensitive for
acute stroke and metastasis.

Renal US [**12-3**]:
Normal renal ultrasound without evidence of hydronephrosis.

Liver US [**12-5**]:
1. Dilated extrahepatic common bile duct, with stent and sludge
seen within. No evidence of intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation.
2. Sludge again seen within the gallbladder, without evidence of
acute cholecystitis.

CXR [**12-6**]:
Improved bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions,
now very small.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59yM with pancreatic mass (likely malignant) s/p
CBD stenting in [**2143-4-9**] who presents with abdominal pain,
jaundice, and hypotension, found to have blocked CBD stent with
frank pus.  He developed respiratory failure and was treated in
the ICU for septic shock.  On [**12-6**], after discussing the matter
with his family, he was made comfort measures only and he passed
away that evening.

# Hypotension/Septic Shock:
Most likely secondary to biliary source. ERCP performed and
re-stented in ICU on arrival, with frank pus behind occluded
stent. Re-ERCP on [**11-24**] after deterioration and re-intubation.
This ERCP showing occluded stent and frank pus.  Another stent
placed in parallel. Blood grew klebsiella pneumoniae (2 species,
pan-sensitive), VRE (sensitive only to linezolid).  Patient was
put on linezolid and zosyn according to ID recommendations.  His
blood pressure was supported with levophed and IV fluids.
Nevertheless, he continued to develop episodes of hypotension
with recurrent fevers on [**12-5**] and [**12-6**].  While awaiting
another repeat ERCP, he continued to deteriorate.  After meeting
with the patient's family, the team agreed to withdraw pressors
and provide comfort measures only.  He passed away in the
evening of [**12-6**].

#) Respiratory failure:
Intubated in ED secondary to altered mental status, extubated
[**11-23**] and re-intubated [**11-24**] with low bp and rigors.  He had
underlying CHF and COPD, and he continued to be difficult to
wean from the vent.

#) Acute on chronic renal failure:
Likely secondary to hypotension (SBP in 50s prior to intubation.
 His ACE inhibitor was held and his medications were renally
dosed.  He was supported with IV fluids and pressors.
Nevertheless, his Cr continued to increase to 2.9 on the day of
his death.

#) Pancreatic mass:
Patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate.  He had no tissue
diagnosis, but given that hi
