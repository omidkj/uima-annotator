referred by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4469**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] for outpatient
cardiac cath, after he had an abnormal stress test and an
echo revealing a possible ascending aortic arch thrombosis.
He had undergone a recent cardiac work-up for symptoms of
dyspnea and chest discomfort on exertion.  He reports that he
has dyspnea and chest fullness after climbing one flight of
stairs, or after walking 10 minutes on a flat surface.  An
echo on [**2102-8-24**] at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital revealed concentric LVH
with mild AS and AI, and a possible ascending aortic arch
thrombosis.  A stress thallium study was done on [**2102-9-29**].
The patient exercised for 5 minutes and stopped secondary to
fatigue and dyspnea.  The EKG was significant for [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depressions in V4 and V5.  Nuclear imaging revealed an apical
infarct and inferior ischemia.  There was LV dilatation with
stress.  His EF was 48%, and he had inferior hypokinesis.
