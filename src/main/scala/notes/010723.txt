Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 85 yo female with h/o CHF, HTN and AFib who presents with
CHF exacerbation.
1. CHF: Pt with echo in [**8-24**] with EF>55%. Likely diastolic
component of HF. Dose of diuretics recently adjusted by PCP as
thought she was overdiuresed and now has had increased fluid
overload.  Started with iv lasix at 40mg IV bid with minimal
response however good response with 80mg iv bid.  Discussed mgmt
with daily weights and adjust lasix dose based on this and may
have to decrease ace/BB dose to tolerate excess diuresis.  Also
as vague left sided chest pain with clinical heart failure out
of proportion to echo, re-reviewed nuclear stress in [**11-23**] with
attending and findings concerning for reversible defect of
anterior wall and taken to catheterization to evaluate for
ischemia contributing to worsening episodesof heart failure. Was
continued on atenolol and lisinopril while in house, but
following catheterization while on integrillin patient developed
hematemesis and was transferred to ccu.  She was also
hypotensive after further diuresis in cath lab.  She was
monitored in the ccu and her blood pressures improved as
diuresis was held.  Her hematocrits remained stable and was
transferred back to floor.  Her diurretics were held with goal
to keep her euvolemic. Then as blood pressure improved, she was
restarted on low dose ace and changed to coreg from atenolol for
heart failure.  She was continued on asprin for life and plavix
for 9months for recently placed stent.  At time of discharge she
was euvolemic with a weight of 81.3kgs.  She will monitor her
weights at rehab.  She was started on 80mg lasix qd with goal to
keep her weight stable within 1-2kg of 81.3kg.  Her blood
pressures should be monitored closely with adjustments in her
lasix regemin.  She was continued on oxygen and this can be
continued to followed and titrated off as tolerated.  Her CXRs
confirmed cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions.  Her
dyspnea was stable with ambulation, but will require continued
physical therapy.  If her weight increased by more than 2kg her
lasix should be increased to twice a day and if she loses more
than 2kg then her lasix dose should be halved.
*
2. CAD: stable no previously known heart disease but after
re-review of nuclear stress, pt went to cardiac cath as above
and had a stent to her distal left circumflex.  For which she
will continue asprin for life and plavix for 9months at least.
*
3. Afib: stable as she is s/p ablation with pacer and maintained
on amiodarone, temporarily bridged with heparin during her stay
and then restarted on her wafarin with good result.  Her goal
INR [**1-23**], but came in supratherapeutic INR and coumadin was held
intiitally and for her catheterization.  She is also continued
on her beta-blocker with good rate control.
*
3. HTN: stable after episode of hypotension after overdiuresis
on floor and during catheterization.  Slowly as her volume
status improved, she was started on low dose lisinopril instead
of enalapril and coreg instead of atenolol because of her heart
failue.  Even as she was re-started on lasix her blood pressure
remained stable.
*
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: her creatinine was 1.5 at
baseline, the source of her chronic renal failure was unclear
and she had bilateral renal ultrasounds with dopplers to assess
for flow across renal arteries as she has a pacer and an MRA is
not possible.  Renal ultrasound was inconclusive for
hypertensive nephropathy vs renal artery stenosis.  During her
catheterization, unfortunately her renal arteries were not
assessed.   Following catheterization she did have a slight
creatinine bump which may have been secondary to contrast
nephropathy, exacerbated by overdiuresis or ATN secondary to
transient hypotension.  However, by time of discharge her
creatinine was 1.2 and stable even on ace and lasix.
*
5. Hematemesis: patient developed hematemesis and melanotic
stools following integrillin infusion post-stent.  She was
transfused and her hematocrit remained stable and she was
eventually taken for EGD and colonoscopy with results as above.
She was started on
