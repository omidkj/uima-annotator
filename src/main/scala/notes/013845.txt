Overdose


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2114-10-7**] placement right internal jugular central line
[**2114-10-7**] endotrachial intubation


History of Present Illness:
67F w/ hx suicide attempts transferred from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to [**Hospital1 18**]
w/ polysubstance overdose. Patient was found lethargic w/
multiple medication bottles (most recently filled trazadone and
cyclobenzaprine). At [**Name (NI) **] pt was initially given Narcan but
shortly thereafter became progressively more bradycardic and
hypotensive with pulse dropping into the 30s and systolic blood
pressure dropping into the 60s; responded to 1 mg of atropine
and fluid bolus with return of pulse 90 and systolic of 115.
Patient also given amp of calcium, and 1 mg of IV glucagon, as
the nature of her ingestion was unknown and could involve
antihypertensives. Given all the above, the patient was
intubated with the Glidescope using
75 mg of succinylcholine and a #6 ET tube.  Given the
hemodynamic nature of this patient's overdose and the unknown
complexity of her ingestion she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].   Head
CT at [**Hospital1 **] reportedly normal.
On arrival in [**Hospital1 18**] ED patient was intubated and sedated. She
became briefly hypotensive during her initial ED course however
this was thought due to a spurious blood pressure cuff [**Location (un) 1131**].
She received 1 dose of some narcan which didn't do much.  She
was seen by tox in the ED who thought OD was multifactorial, but
suggested a beta blocker component given
bradycardia/hypotension.  GCS of 5 on transfer from the ED.
Exam notable for normal tone no clonus. Pupils 3mm and reactive.
Mucous membranes moist.  CXR unremarkable.
Of note pt recently admitted to [**Hospital3 4107**] and discharged
on [**10-5**] with e.coli UTI with sepsis.
VS on arrival to the ED: T97 P88 119/73 R17.  Pt received 2
boluses of IV glucagon and a right IJ was placed for access

IMAGING:
==============
[**2114-10-8**] CXR: The patient is tilted towards the left. A new right
jugular line ends in mid SVC, ET tube ends 7.2 cm above carina.
NG tube is in the stomach. Left lower lobe atelectasis is
unchanged. Changes related to severe emphysema is stable with
high lung volumes and upper lobe oligemia. An electronic device
is seen overlying the left upper lobe.
CONCLUSION:
New right-sided jugular line is in adequate position. There is
no
complication.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 53899**] is a 66 year old F with history of depression and
suicide attempts who presented after her family found her
overdosed at home.  She was obtunded and bradycardic,
hypotensive.  She admitted suicidal attempt when she was
extubated later and did not remember the medications she took,
but said there were at least 3 different kinds.

# Toxicology: Initial bradycardia and hypoglycemia were
suggestive of beta blocker component to overdose.  However,
uncertain surrounding actual substances, likely included
clopidogrel.  Her QT interval was monitored with telemetry and
serial EKGs.  Acetaminophen and aspirin were both negative on
serum toxicology.

# Depression with Suicidal attempt via overdose with
polysubstances: Medically managed as below.  Seen by psychiatry
who recommended that she go to an inpatient psych facility.  All
her psych meds were held because of their sedating effects
initially.  Also, psych consult agreed that none of her issues
were acute and needed medication immediately.  She was kept on a
1:1 observation for suicidal actions.

# Respiratory failure due to altered mental status (AMS):
Patient was inbutated at [**Hospital3 **] prior to transfer.  AMS
most likely related to intoxication, though the exact ingestion
is unclear and likely polysubstance.  Toxicology saw pt in the
ED and felt that at least some of the overdose was beta blocker,
and in fact pt did transiently increase BPs with administration
of glucagon.   Serum and Urine tox screens at [**Hospital1 18**] all
negative, but doesn't ru
