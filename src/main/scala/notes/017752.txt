No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2927**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy, sleepiness, urinary incontinence

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 26812**] is a 66yo W with a history of longstanding tobacco
abuse, EtOH Abuse (3 drinks/night per family), lower back pain
s/p placement of thecal morphine pump, recent history of
recurrent pneumonia/bronchitis, HTN, HLD, GERD, anemia who was
brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for complaints of altered mental status
and urinary incontinence. Her history started two weeks ago
approximately when she developed her third pneumonia of the year
and she was hospitalized at [**Hospital **] Hospital for the same,
treated with IV antibiotics and discharged to rehab. During her
short rehab stint, she developed an episode of "shakiness", high
blood pressures to the 200s systolic, and visual disturbances
characterized as flashes of light in the peripheral visual
fields, odd shadows/contours around objects in her field as well
as patchy areas of blindness. During this episode, she was
confused. They improved her blood pressure and 12 hours after
the onset of symptoms her visual disturbance improved. She
received CT imaging (which "ruled out" stroke), as well as
carotid US imaging which showed the presence of a right sided
70% stenosis
of the carotid artery. She was once again discharged to rehab.

Over the past two days prior to her ED presentation this time,
she was noted to be once again shaky, confused, lethargic and
displaying urinary incontinence. She was noted to be quite
perseverative and repeating herself, but was comprehending well
and the language that she used ultimately made sense. For these
complaints, the patient's family insisted that she brought to
the [**Hospital1 18**].

Reports:

EEG [**2159-1-17**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU
monitoring study because of intermittent epileptic discharges
bilaterally in the posterior quadrants. These epileptic
discharges, at times, occur in a generalized distribution and
occasionally become briefly periodic. These findings are
indicative of independent areas of cortical irritability in the
posterior quadrants that are potentially epileptogenic as well
as
generalized cortical irritability. In addition, the background
is
diffusely slow, indicative of a mild diffuse encephalopathy of
non-specific etiology. Note is made of sinus bradycardia through
most
of the recording.

CXR [**2159-1-17**]: Patchy left base opacity most likely represents
atelectasis,
although underlying aspiration not excluded.

NCHCT [**2159-1-17**]:
Severely limited evaluation due to streak artifact from EEG
cables, within
those limitations, no large, obvious acute intracranial process.


NCHCT, CTA Head/Neck [**2159-1-18**]:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Mixed hard and soft plaques at the carotid artery
bifurcations; moderate
narrowing of the right proximal internal carotid artery due to
the plaque.
3. Right-sided thyroid nodule. Recommend thyroid ultrasound on a

non-emergent basis for further characterization.
4. Biapical pleural scarring, if clinically indicated, would be
better
evaluated with a dedicated chest CT.

and the language that she used ultimately made sense. In the ED,
her examination was significant for inattention, inability to
follow commands, diffuse paratonia and a possible right lower
extremity drift. On her statnet EEG, she was noted to have
multifocal epileptiform discharges (L>R) and loaded with keppra.
