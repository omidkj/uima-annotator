Pertinent Results:
[**2124-7-11**] ECHO
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is markedly dilated with a saccular shaped
aneurysm. The aortic arch is moderately dilated. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen.
6. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of Phenylephrine. AV pacing for frequent
pac's, svt. Well-seated mechanical valve in the aortic position
with some AI on the interatrial side that is improved after
protamine. Normal washing jets are visible. No AS. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] are

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 85410**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2124-7-11**] for surgical
management of his aortic valve stenosis and ascending aortic
aneurysm. He was taken directly to the operating room where he
underwent an aortic valve replacement using a mechanical valve
and replacement of his ascending aorta. Please see operative
note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive
care unit for monitoring. Over the next few hours, Mr. [**First Name (Titles) 85410**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]e neurologically intact and was extubated. Beta blockade was
titrated. On postoperative day one, he was transferred to the
step down unit for further recovery. He went into A Fib and
converted to SR on amiodarone. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. Coumadin was dosed for an INR on 2.5-3.0 for a
mechanical aortic valve.

Mr. [**Known lastname 85411**] continued to make steady progress and was discharged
home on postoperative day five by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. He will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary care
physician as an outpatient. First blood draw with VNA on Monday
[**7-17**] with results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18323**].
