Chief Complaint:
fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
84 yo M with PMH of HTN, hyperparathyroidism and h/o prostate ca
s/p prostatectomy who presents s/p syncope to the ED. The
patient reports having a eye doctors visit today and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] going
to [**Company 4916**]. He remembers waking up with medical personal
around him. Per report, he fell forward with +/- LOC.  He does
not remember feeling palpitations, dizzy, lightheaded, nauseated
or any other symptoms prior to falling.
.
In the ED, he was noted to have a HR initially in the 60s. His
HR then decreased to the 30-40s and even transiently to the 20s.
He remained normotensive. He had pacer pads placed. A head CT
showed a small SAH and neurosurgery was consulted. He was given
some morphine (IV 2mg) for pain control and had some confusion.
A head CT was repeated for concern for bleeding but the SAH was
stable. He also had several broken teeth and had a CT face and C
spine to rule out fracture. He was given a tetanus booster. His
BP was in the 180s and he was given some nitro paste.
.
Currently, he has some chronic back pain. Also some right thigh
pain. Does not complain of headache or change in vision. No
feeling of confusion.  No n/v, f/c, diarrhea, constipation.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations.

Pertinent Results:
[**3-14**] MRI brain.
FINDINGS:  Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute
infarct.  As seen on the CT, there is subarachnoid hemorrhage
identified along the sulci in the right frontal lobe with an
intraparenchymal hemorrhage which has characteristics of an
acute hematoma.  The intraparenchymal hematoma measures
approximately 2 cm.  Following gadolinium, several small areas
of high density seen and surrounding the hemorrhage and also
along the margin which corresponds to blood products but subtle
marginal enhancement is seen.  A small area of blood products is
identified in the septum pellucidum and small area of blood is
seen in the ventricular system which could be posttraumatic in
nature as suggested.  A tiny subdural hematoma is seen measuring
2-3 mm extending from the left frontal to occipital region.  No
other abnormal areas of enhancement seen.
IMPRESSION:  No acute infarct seen.  Intraparenchymal and
subarachnoid
hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe.  Subtle surrounding
enhancement is seen which could be noted in a hematoma without
underlying abnormality but a followup examination is suggested.
Other findings as described above.

EEG [**3-15**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG in the waking and
drowsy
states due to the disorganized and poorly modulated background
with
excessive admixed theta frequencies and bursts of generalized
delta
frequency slowing consistent with a mild encephalopathy. This
suggests
dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.

Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the
common
causes of encephalopathy but there are others. There were no
areas of
prominent focal slowing although encephalopathic patterns can
sometimes
obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform features and
no
electrographic seizure activity was noted.

CT chest with contrast and reconstructions [**3-14**]:
COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs [**2139-3-13**] and [**2131-4-25**],  CT
abdomen and pelvis [**2132-10-28**].
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is generalized cachexia.  The
thyroid gland is grossly unremarkable.  There is mild aneurysmal
dilation of the ascending aorta measuring 4.7 cm in greatest
axial dimension.  There is tri-vessel coronary artery
calcification and mild cardiomegaly.  Calcified
atherosclerotic plaque is noted within the aortic arch and
descending aorta. Evaluation of the lung parenchyma demonstrates
moderate-to-severe
centrilobular emphysematous changes within the upper lungs.
Within the left lung apex, there is an irregular soft tissue
density (2A:9) measuring 1.1 cm in greatest axial dimension.  In
the right upper lobe, there is a rounded lesion measuring
(2A:17) 1.2 x 1 cm and containing two  calcifications.  In the
posterior segment of the right upper lobe, there is a 1 x 0.5 cm
soft tissue nodule with adjacent somewhat reticular and alveolar
opacity abutting the oblique fissure and pleural surface
(2A:23).  A focus of calcification is present along the right
inferior posterior pleural surface (2A:49).  There is a small
right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
This study is not performed for evaluation of structures below
the diaphragm. However, there is a large partially visualized
cystic structure measuring 8.7 cm in greatest transverse
dimension in the suprarenal space corresponding to a large right
renal cyst on study d
