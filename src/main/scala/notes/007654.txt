History of Present Illness:
 Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old male with CAD, HTN, asthma, gout
TIA, CKD (baseline 1.8) who was doing well until 10 days ago. He
had right abdominal pimple that grew in size until ED
presentation on [**2139-6-8**] which led to I&D and discharge with
Bactrime. He saw his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2139-6-9**]. He reports since
starting Bactrim on [**2139-6-10**] he has had nausea and abdominal
discomfort so he stopped taking it yesterday. He reported
feeling dizzy for past two days. He was seen today by his PCP
for nausea, weakness and malaise for which electrolytes were
done. On these labs, a K was reported to be 7.2 with Cr of 3.5.
Thus the patient was sent to ED for evaluation.
In ED, initial VS were: 97.7 65 130/55 17 97%. EKG reported
showed peaked T waves and patient was given Calcium gluconate,
insulin/D50 and kayexalate. CXR was completed and was otherwise
unremarkable. He was given 1LNS. Repeat K initially was 3.8
however another sample taken at the same time was 6.6. Decision
was then made to admit patient to MICU for close monitoring.

On arrival to the MICU, he reports no complaints except urge for
bowel movement.

CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2139-6-17**]
FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  The
lungs appear clear without focal consolidation, effusion or
pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and normal.  Bony
structures are intact though degenerative changes at both AC
joints are noted.
IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hyperkalemia in setting of [**Last Name (un) **]: Due to perfect storm of volume
depletion from poor oral intake and vomiting with GI side effect
of Bactrim, inability to physiologically compensate with
preglomerular effects of Bactrim and postglomerular effects of
ACE-I. Recieved calcium gluconate, kayexale, Insulin and D50 for
mild peaked T waves. Potasium down to 5.8 on [**6-18**] labs and 5.4
when he was transferred from MICU to floor where pt received
albuterol and calcium gluconate for presistent peaked T waves on
EKG. Also received another dose of kayexalate. On [**6-20**], K
measured at 4.9 and 4.6. EP EKG showed normalization of peaked T
waves.

# [**Last Name (un) **]: No admitted with a creatinine of 3.9; his baseline is
1.8. Cause of baseline CKD is unknown to the patient. CKD likely
due to both volume depletion and Bactrim toxicity. Creatinine
return to baseline with hydration and discontinuation of
Bactrim.

# Hypertension: Held lisinopril in setting of acute kidney
injury. Continued metoprolol.

# Abdominal wall abscess s/p I&D. His wound looked well drained
with good source control. No indication for antibiotics, so
discontinued doxycycline and clindamycin.

# Gout: Changed allopurinol to 100 mg po qdaily due to [**Last Name (un) **]. Had
not been taking at home because he was confused and thought he
should stop all meds, not just bactrim. started to develop mild
pain in 1st metatarsophalangeal joint on HD3, but pain had
improved by time of discharge.

# HLD: continued simvastatin

# CAD: continued ASA

# Asthma: continued albuterol PRN, Advair PRN

# Pain/insomnia: continued tramadol PRN
