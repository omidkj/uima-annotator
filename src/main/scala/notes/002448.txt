Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization and bare metal stent placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo F with history of inferior STEMI in [**5-22**]
complicated by hypotension and bradycardia requiring temporary
pacing during RCA stenting who presents with inferolateral
STEMI. She awoke from sleep with severe CP that did not resolve
with 3 NTG and called EMS.  Per EMS, she was bradycardic to the
30s requiring atropine enroute.
.
In the ER, she received levophed, dopamine, heparin drip, [**Date Range 4532**]
load, zofran and morphine.  Her HR was persistently low
requiring two more doses of atropine.  The cath [**Date Range **] was
activated, and she underwent cath showing stent thrombosis of
proximal RCA BMS that was treated with Export thrombectomy, PTA
and stenting with BMS.  Her course was complicated by
bradycardia requiring temporary pacer wire placement.  She was
weaned off pressors while in the [**Date Range **].
.
In the CCU, she reports feeling much better now.  Patient denies
any CP other than last night but her son reports an episode
angina last week that resolved with two NTG.
.
On review of systems, she has a history of CVA and is recovering
from a bout of bronchitis causing cough.  She denies any prior
history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding
at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains or hemoptysis. She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING
[**2190-10-17**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had mild luminal
irregularities and a patent stent. The LCx had mild luminal
irregularities. The RCA was found to be totally occluded very
proximally/ostially.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe hypotension with
initial
blood pressure of 73/50 and bradycardia with heart rate of
40bpm. She
was receiving Levophed and Dopamine from the ED. An urgent
temporary
pacing wire was placed and set with rate of 80bpm with
successful
capture.
3. Successful PCI and stenting of a mid-RCA 100% occlusive
culprit
lesion with a 3.0 x 12 mm Integrity bare metal stent with no
residual
stenosis. Minimal residual stenosis in the distal RCA stent and
in the
RPL branch following POBA (to ensure adequate outflow from the
mid-RCA
stent).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. STEMI due to stent thrombosis of the proximal RCA bare metal
stent
placed in [**2186**].
2. Successful placement of temporary pacer wire for bradycardia
associated with hemodynamic compromise.
3. Initial hemodynamic compromise improved with pacing,
pressors, and
revascularization. Patient was able to be weaning off pressors
by end of
case with hemodynamic stability.
4. Aspirin 325mg daily x3 months then 162mg daily x12 months.
[**Year (4 digits) **]
75mg daily for minimum 3 months, likely longer.

[**2190-10-17**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. A-V conduction delay. There are ST
segment elevations in leads II, III and aVF with corresponding T
wave inversions, as well as T wave inversions in leads V5-V6
consistent with acute transmural ischemia in the inferolateral
territory. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2186-5-25**] inferior
injury pattern is new. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
[**2190-10-18**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Deep T wave inversions in leads II,
III and aVF. T wave flattening in leads V5-V6. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2190-10-17**] ST segment elevations have resolved.
However, T wave inversions are deeper consistent with evolution
of acute myocardial infarction.
.
[**2190-10-17**] ECHO
LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 40
percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen (may be underestimated due to technically suboptimal
imaging). There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2190-10-18**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal
half of the inferior and mid inferolateral walls. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 50%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution). Mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic valve stenosis. Pulmonary
artery hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-10-17**],
global left ventricular systolic function is minimally improved.
