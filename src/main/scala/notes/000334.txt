On Discharge:

Pertinent Imaging:
[**2116-7-14**]
AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS, TWO VIEWS OF THE RIGHT HIP: Comminuted
right
intertrochanteric proximal femoral fracture is demonstrated with
varus
angulation and mild lateral displacement of the distal fracture
fragment. The hips demonstrate mild degenerative changes with
joint space narrowing. The sacroiliac joints and pubic symphysis
are not diastatic. There is diffuse demineralization of the
osseous structures. Degenerative changes are also seen involving
the lower lumbosacral spine. There are diffuse vascular
calcifications.

[**2116-7-14**]
CXR: There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
The mediastinal and hilar contours demonstrate unchanged
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with vascular calcifications.
The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. There are linear
opacities within the left lung base and right mid lung field
compatible with subsegmental atelectasis. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. No focal consolidation is
seen.  Compression deformity of a low thoracic vertebral body is
present but similar compared to the prior study.

Ms [**Known lastname 19444**] was admitted on [**2116-7-14**] for a right hip fracture.

she underwent open reduction internal fixation of the right hip
without complication. She was extubated and transferred to the
recovery room in stable condition.  In the recovery room she was
transfused one unit of blood cells for post operative anemia.
She was transferred to the floor and there were no overnight
events on the night of surgery. She is being discharged in
stable condition to rehabilitation facility.
