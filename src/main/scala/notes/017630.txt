Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
84F w/ reported history of COPD, metastatic cancer, and HTN
initially sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for evaluation of hypoxia. She was in
her USOH and residing at [**Hospital3 2558**] when transferred for
evaluation of SOB. EMS reported elevated neck veins, blood
pressure of 90/palp and tachypnea w/ sats of 82 on unclear fio2
([**Name2 (NI) 597**]).
.
In ED, she was found to have rectal temp of 101.2, bp 94/71, and
was tachypneic to the 30's while satting 99% on [**Name2 (NI) 597**].  Per
report, she at this time had rales, coarse breath sounds, and
elevated neck veins. She received nebulizers, levaquin, and
solumedrol for ?copd excerbation and ?pna. Initial CXR
demonstrated marked scoliosis but no infiltrate and her chest
CTA was negative for PE but notable for chronic intersitial
changes and ?ingested pill.  Her initial labs were notable for
leukocytosis to 14K w/ left shift and mild bandemia, flat
enzymes, and BNP of 1133.  Her UA was also suggestive for UTI.
Given the concerns about CHF and rales on exam, she received 20
iv lasix.  Overall, through her ER course she received 600 cc
IVF and made 600 cc urine.  An ABG checked on presumed [**Name2 (NI) 597**] was
7.38/44/209 with a lacate of 2.6.  She was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for further monitoring.
.
Pt not completely sure why she was transferred to hospital
although she admits to productive pinkish cough of unclear
duration. No definite increased sob or wheezing. No cp/abdominal
pain. No fevers, chills. No changes to bowel/urinary habits.
.
Overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was treated with
levaquin/flagyl but this was changed to unasyn when she was
thought to be at risk for an aspiration event.  She remained
afebrile on this regimen overnight.  Her mental status cleared
per report and she tolerated PO intake this AM w/out signs of
overt aspiration.  She also had several episodes of tachycardia
c/w MAT and received several fluid boluses and a 1x order of
metoprolol. By the time of call-out, she was satting in the high
90s w/ only a 3L NC.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 84F w/ reported history of COPD, CAD, and metastatic cancer
now being evaluated for reported hypoxic resp distress

1. Resp Distress: The patient was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] secondary to
hypoxia in the ED requiring a [**Hospital Unit Name 597**].  She was treated empirically
in the ED with lasix for ? CHF, steroids/abx/nebs for ? COPD,
and antibiotics for a ? PNA.  She was r/o for PE with a CTA.  In
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was quickly weaned to a nasal canula and continued
on her nebulizer treatments.  On the floor, she was afebrile and
w/out definitive evidence of a pneumonia but her antibiotics
were continued empirically.  She was continued on her nebulizers
and weaned to RA prior to discharge.

2. Tachycardia: In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was noted to be
tachycardic to the 130s while remaining hemodynamically stable.
Her EKG was c/w sinus tach vs MAT.  The patient denied pain but
was mildly febrile at the time.  SHe was started on a low dose
betablocker and fluid repleted as she appeared dry on physical
exam.  On the floor, she had a recurrence of the same rhythm but
responded well to fluid boluses.  Her antibiotics and beta
blocker were continued.  She was in NSR with a regular rate at
the time of discharge.

3. UTI: The patient had a dirty UA in the ED and was treated for
this with levaquin.  She remained afebrile on the floor and will
complete a 7d course at her facility.

4. ?CAD: She was continued on asa and a low dose bb was started
as above.

5. HTN: Beta blocker was used as above.

6. COPD: management as above

7. ?Metastatic cancer: Per conversations with the son, the
patient has had a work-up at [**Hospital1 2177**] where she was found to have
extensive bony metastases as well as a skull mets w/ ? extention
into the brain.  She was given decadron at [**Hospital1 2177**] and offered more
aggressive treatment but became acutely psychotic while on the
steroids and she and her son decided to avoid further treatment
of her malignancy.  The patient has a history of breast cancer
that was treated and is presumed to have metastatic disease now
[**12-18**] that primary but no definitive w/u has been done because of
her unwillingness to undergo treatment.  She was continued on
her outpatient fentanyl patch for pain control and noted good
relief with this regimen.

8. ?Altered MS: As above, the patient's son notes that she
"hasn't been herself" since she received steroid therapy at [**Hospital1 2177**].
 At [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was pleasant and cooperative but not
oriented.  This was partially attributed to her underlying UTI
and she was treated as above.  There is a question of extension
of her cancer into her brain but this was not worked up.
