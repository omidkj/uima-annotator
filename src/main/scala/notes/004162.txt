History of Present Illness:
63yo F with prior diagnosis of pancreatic cancer that was
unresectable and is s/p chemo/XRT.  A CBD stent had been placed
in [**5-7**] to relieve biliary obstruction.  Pt was recently
receiving chemotherapy whose treatment was halted due to
progressive fatigue/weakness.  2d prior to [**Hospital1 18**] admission she
presented to [**Hospital3 **] hospital for hematemesis where an EGD
demonstrated the CBD stent had slipped distally into the
duodenum and was causing erosion against the duodenal wall.  She
was transfused 2u PRBC, hemodynamically stable, and transferred
for [**Hospital1 18**] for further management and resumption of her prior
care that was performed here.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was initially admitted to the floor but subsequently had an
episode of large melena associated with hypotension and
non-responsiveness.  2L IVF were bolused and she was transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  CVL lines placed and paracentesis performed for
ascites, transfused 2u PRBC, and begun empiric antibiotics.  GI
consulted and ERCP performed the following morning, finding the
CBD stent in the duodenal lumen which was removed.  That
afternoon, respiratory distress ensued with hypoxia, and the
patient was intubated in the ERCP-PACU.  The abdomen was
distended and tympanitic, a KUB was concerning for localized air
but no free air.  Surgical consult from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the Gold
(hepatobiliary) service was obtained and, after extensive
discussion with the family, decision was reached for exploratory
laparotomy for duodenal perforatoin from wall stent erosion,
which was performed on [**3-22**] with a biliary bypass, repair
of duodenal perforation.  She continued to require aggressive
IVF resuscitation in SICU on the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] but overall was
hemodynamically improved on moderate dose levophed.
The evening of POD 1 ([**2-14**]) was notable for an acute
desaturation into the 30's associated with hypotension into the
50's.  Max'd pressors with large-scale IVF resuscitation.  ABG
showed worsening acidosis.  SVT into 200's ensued which
converted into sinus tachycardia in 120's.  A swan-ganz catheter
was utilized to guide management.  Clinical picture highly
suspicious and consistent with massive pulmonary embolus, but
was too unstable for radiographic confirmation.  Heparin drip
was begun empirically.
No further events ensued that evening as pressors remained at
high levels, broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued, and net
positive IVF resuscitation was required.  cc per cc replacement
of high JP (ascites) output commenced.  Over the next few days,
ventilatory pressures were high and vent changed to
pressure-control ventilation.  Thrombocytopenia ensued, a HIT
was negative and heparin maintained throughout.  Hematocrits
were stable.  An echocardiogram on [**2-15**] demonstrated no
pericardial effusion.  With results from admission cultures,
antibiotics were adjusted.  Trophic tube feeds begun.  With
rising bilirubin, ultrasound revealed complete thrombosis of the
portal vein.  A family meeting was held on POD 5 and she was
made DNR.  With worsening thrombocytopenia to 7, a hematology
consult was obtained, and she was transfused platelets.
On the morning on POD 9, she became hypotensive with falling
hematocrit and worsening pressor and IVF requirement.  Some
mucosal bleeding was noted.  After a lengthy discussion with the
family, decision was reached to move to CMO care.  Morphine gtt
was titrated, pressors withdrawn, and eventually she was
extubated and passed away in the presence of her family.
