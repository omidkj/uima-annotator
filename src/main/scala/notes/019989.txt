Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 23009**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2168-1-16**]

History of Present Illness:
89yo female with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate, history of anemia, and
history of low back pain who presents with arm and throat pain.
.
The patient was in her usual state of health until 6pm yesterday
when she developed sudden onset of arm pain associated with a
sore throat.  This was not associated with diaphoresis, chest
pain, palpitations or shortness of breath.  Her symptoms
persisted so, around 1130pm, she was brought to the ED by her
family.
.
On arrival to the ED, EKG demonstrated ST-elevations in I, aVL.
She received aspirin, heparin gtt and SL nitro with some relief
of her symptoms and was taken to the cath lab.  While in the
cath lab, she received plavix 300mg and bivalirudin.  Cath
demonstrated an occlusion of a small OM branch of LCx so no
intervention was performed.  The patient remained
hemodynamically stable after the procedure.  She is being
admitted to the CCU for further monitoring.
.
On arrival to the CCU, vital signs were T- 96.1, HR 69, BP
172/66, RR 21, SaO2- 100% on 2L NC.  The patient remains chest
pain free but has persistent arm and throat pain that is much
improved from prior to arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On review of systems, she denies any deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  She only
reports arm and throat pain.

Cadiac Catherization [**2168-1-16**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated one vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
angiographically-free of any flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD
had a mid
30-40% lesion involving D1.  D1 itself was noted to have a
50-60%
stenosis.  The LCx had an occluded branch before a moderate OM1;
no AV
groove Cx identified.  The RCA was a large vessel that had a
40-50%
lesion at the ostium, as well as a 50% lesion distally.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
systolic
arterial pressures, with a central aortic pressure of 135/59,
mean 66
mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease - lateral STEMI likely due
to
occluded small OM branch of LCx.
2. Systemic systolic arterial normotension.

TTE ([**2168-1-16**]):
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the basal half of the anterolateral wall. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (LCX or Diagonal
distribution). Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
89yo female with multiple cardiac risk factors admitted with
ST-elevation MI.
.
#.CAD: Patient with ST-elevation MI, found to have occlusion of
small OM branch during cath. No intervention was indicated at
the time of the procedure. She was plavix loaded and started on
75 daily in AM, also started ASA 325mg PO daily, bivalirudin and
SL nitro. After procedure she was chest pain free but initially
reported mild left arm/shoulder pain which resolved. Post-cath
echo showed normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
regional systolic dysfunction (LVEF 55%) c/w CAD (LCX or
Diagonal distribution) amd mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Patient
initially on high-dose atorvastatin; discharged on pravastatin
80mg daily given lower risk of myalgias. Also started ASA 325
daily, losartan 25mg daily, metoprolol 25mg daily and plavix 75
daily.
.
#.Fever: patient had fever to 100.8 in the 24hrs following cath.
Initial concern was aspiration PNA given that she was seen
possibly aspirating food while in CCU. However, CXR WNL. Blood
cx and urine cx NGTD. Most likely etiology is post-STEMI
inflammation causing cytokine release resulting in fever, as can
occur in the natural history of myocardial infarction when no
intervention occurs.
.
#.Hypertension:  Patient's blood pressures ranging from SBP
130s-160s on admission; on amlodipine and losartan at home.
Amlodipine was discontinued, losartan was continued and
metoprolol also added in the post-MI setting.
