MICROBIOLOGY:  [**3-29**] blood culture: negative, [**3-29**] c. diff:
negative, [**4-4**] c. diff: negative

RADIOLOGY:
[**2165-3-18**] CXR: There are small bilateral pleural effusions and
associated bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis
and/or consolidation, especially in the left lower lobe,
essentially unchanged. No definite new lung lesions. No
pneumothorax.

[**2165-3-27**] CXR: Patient is status post interval median sternotomy
and coronary artery bypass surgery. An endotracheal tube is
present, terminating in the right main bronchus. Swan-Ganz
catheter terminates in the distal right pulmonary artery, right
PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava, nasogastric tube
terminates below the diaphragm, and mediastinal drains and
left-sided chest tube are present. Cardiac and mediastinal
contours are stable compared to the preoperative radiograph.
There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema present, note is made
of patchy atelectasis in left lower lobe and lingula as well as
a probable small left pleural effusion.

[**2165-4-10**] CXR: 1. Left PICC terminating in the distal SVC without
evidence of pneumothorax.
2. Continued bilateral pleural effusions and left basilar
atelectasis

CARDIOLOGY:
[**2165-3-18**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the basal to
mid inferior wall . Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated
(>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-2-19**], the
overall LVEF is similar and the degree of mitral regurgitation
appears slightly less.

[**2165-3-27**] TEE: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include akinetic basal inferior which is also
aneurysmal; mid and apical anteroseptal and anterior hypokinetic
walls; basal inferoseptal hypokinetic wall. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. .
Mitral valve: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened
with no prolapsing or flail segments. Evaluation by color flow
doppler (vena contracta 4-5mm), pulmonary venous inflow (no
systolic reversal or blunting of pulmonary veins of both sides),
mitral annulus (30mm), dilated left atrium (4.7cm) and normal
sized left ventricle in diastole (5.6 cm), a central regurgitant
jet is visualized which is consistent with moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation under anesthesia and with provocative measures
like trendelenburg position.
POSTBYPASS:
Mild improvement in the wall motion abnormalities of the
previously hypokinetic areas. LVEF 40% with epinephrine running
at 0.05mcg/kg/min. Mitral regurgitation is mild to moderate.
Ascending aorta looks okay without any evidence of dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 79 year old female who was admitted with unstable
angina on [**2165-3-18**]. This was in the setting of cardiac
catheterization with stenting. She was hemodynamically stable on
admission and was admitted to the floor for close monitoring.
Cardiology was [**Date Range 4221**] upon admission for pre-operative
planning and a preoperative echo was obtained. She was continued
on lasix and beta-blockade preoperatively but plavix (for her
recent lower extremity bypass) was held. Vascular surgery
consultation was obtained given her recent bypass procedure and
history of groin infection and she was started on pre-operative
antibiotics. [**Last Name (un) **] co
