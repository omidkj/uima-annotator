The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%) Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

swallow eval [**2172-12-21**]
SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
The pt did not have any overt signs of aspiration and can
continue on the current regular diet with thin liquids. She will
benefit from wearing the PMV during POs, but noted she has been
tolerating POs without the PMV in place. She can swallow her
pills whole with water. She reported her intake has been limited
b/c she fatigues, so she may continue to need small amounts of
tube feeds until she can take in more by mouth .

This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of 7, wfl.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Continue on current PO diet of thin liquids and regular
solids.

2. Pills whole with thin liquids.

3. Pt will benefit from wearing the PMV throughout the day,
including when taking Pos.

These recommendations were shared with the patient, nurse and
medical team.
