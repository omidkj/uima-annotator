History of Present Illness:
81 yo Greek speaking only woman with CHF, EF 50% with cirrhosis,
portal HTN, CRI, BL 1.5 admitted to [**Hospital3 **]1 week ago
([**6-2**])with RUQ abdominal pain. RUQ US and HIDA scan per OSH
showed acute cholecystitis for which unasyn was started. Cr
gradually increased from 1.6 on admit despite hydration. Per
notes, renal was consulted and gave fluid challenge, urine lytes
with UNa of 6. Was thought to be in hepatorenal syndrome and
started on octreotide and midodrine with minimal response. per
notes, also started on IV steroids and dopamine at times for ?
hypotension, though none documented. Urine output 100 cc for
past 24 hours with gradual increase in LE edema
Was afebrile throughout with no localizing sx. other than
continued RUQ abdominal pain. On d/c, labs significant for Na
131, HCO3 16, BUN 62, Cr 4.0. CBC, INR 1.4. On day of transfer
had emesis X1 and O2 transiently decreased with new o2
requirement of 4L. ABG 7.20/33/127 on 4L. Family concerned with
care at [**Location (un) **] and requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In ambulance, apparently pt. with desats and increased lethargy.

negative.

IMPRESSION:

No acute intracranial pathology. Atrophy with dilatation of
lateral ventricles including temporal horns. [**Month (only) 116**] be seen with
communicating hydrocephalus in appropriate setting. If old exams
are available, comparison would be helpful.
[**6-10**] abd us:
IMPRESSION:
1. Nondistended gallbladder with multiple shadowing stones
within its lumen. A small amount of fluid adjacent to it. No
prior studies are available for comparison. Findings are
equivocal for acute cholecystitis, please correlate clinically.
2. Patent portal veins and hepatic veins with biphasic flow
suggestive of hepatic congestion and right heart failure.
3. Borderline splenomegaly.
4. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
5. Small amount of ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo with cirrhosis, renal failure, biventricular heart failure
presented with abdominal pain and renal failure, now intubated
on pressors, received trial of CRRT with no improvement with
worsenign volume overload, respiratory failure.
.
# Fever: Increased secretions but no clear infiltrate on CXR.
Also with positive U/A. Femoral HD line another potensial
source. Spiked to 100.9F 3d ago. Leukocytosis but lactate
normal. Pt initially received vanco/zosyn for broad coverage
(dose vanco by level, goal 15-20). vanco d/c'd as no e/o G+
infection. Pt then was found to have Burkholderia Cepacia in
sputum, ceftaz sensitive, but apparently this bug develops ESBL
rather fast, so will tx with bactim per ID recs. started today
(day 1=[**6-28**]) will continue for 14d course. During [**6-28**] and [**6-29**]
the patient began to have increasing pressor requirements due to
morbidity of her other conditions.  After multiple discussions
with the family, the patient was first made DNR and then changed
to CMO and expired shortly afterwards.   Blood cultures never
turned positive.
.
# Hypotension: Likely biventricular failure based on elevated
PCWP and dilated RV, worsened in the setting of acute infection
and possibly volume overload. Echo with normal EF, mild
hypertrophy suggesting some diastolic dysfunction; trial of Swan
with fluid challenges showed no change in CI/CO which was
2.8/41. Initiall on steroids but had appropriate [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim so
tapered off. Pressor requirement increased yesterday but now
decreasing.  Patient was maintained on levophed gtt for the last
7 days of the hospital course.  As her the heart failure became
more severe and while the patient was off cvvhd, the pressor
rquirements increased.  Renal recomme
