Pertinent Results:
[**11-5**] Cath: 1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant
system revealed severe three vessel coronary disease. The LMCA
was short and patent albeit heavily calcified. The LAD was also
heavily calcified with an ostial 30% stenosis and a proximal 40%
stenosis with a mid-tubular 40% stenosis before S1 and 50% at
S1. The mid-LAD had diffuse 80-90% stenosis in a possibly
intramyocardial segment with diffuse diease throughout and a
distal 70% stenosis. D1 had a proximal 80% stenosis. The LAD
gave collaterals to the RPDA. The LCX was also heavily calcified
with diffuse disease throughout up to 80% in the mid-portion
with collaterals to the distal RCA and a moderate stenosis at
the origin of a high small OM1. The RCA was heavily calcified
with a proximal 70% stenosis and mid total occlusion after AM1
with faint collaterals distally. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics
revealed mildly elevated systemic arterial pressure with an SBP
of 147 mm Hg. The LVEDP was severely elevated at 35 mm Hg for
which 20 mg IV lasix was given during the procedure. There was
no significant gradient across the aortic valve with left-heart
pullback. 3. Left ventriculography was deferred given elevated
left-sided filling pressures.
[**11-7**] Echo: PRE BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. A patent
foramen ovale is present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. There is moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with EF 30-35%. There is inferoapical, anteroapical, and
anteroseptal hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial pericardial
effusion, and small bilateral pleural effusions (L>R). POST
BYPASS: The patient is in sinus rhythm and is on an infusion of
phenylephrine and epinephrine. Left and right ventricular
function is improved, EF is now approximately 45-50%. The aorta
is intact. The MR is now mild. The remainder of the study is
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mrs. [**Known lastname 14429**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel
coronary disease. She was then appropriately worked up for
surgery.

On [**11-7**] she was brought to the operating room where she
underwent coronary artery bypass grafts x 4. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery she was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition on neosynephrine, epinephrine and insulin infusions.
Within 24 hours she was weaned from sedation and pressors, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated.

She developed rapid atrial fibrillation which was treated with
IV Amiodarone,and beta blockers. She had nausea and vomiting
requiring Reglan and Zofran, perhaps related to gastroparesis
from her diabetes.  She converted to sinus rhythm on an
Amiodarone infusion. Beta blockers were added. On POD #4, her
LFTs rose and she had bilious emesis. General surgery was
consulted. US showed gall bladder sludge and edema.Chest tubes
and pacing wires removed per protocol.Transferred to the floor
on POD #5 to begin increasing her activity level.   Beta
blockade was titrated and coumadin started for continuing PAFib.
Diet was slowly advanced and LFTs monitored.  LFT's continued to
improve. She was discharged to rehab on POD 8 with goals of
continued diuresis, therapeutic INR, and strength.
