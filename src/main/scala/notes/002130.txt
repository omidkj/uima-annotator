Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amoxicillin / Verapamil / Univasc

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1572**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower extremity swelling


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular line placement with replacment over a
guidewire
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with asthma, atrial fibrillation on
Dabigatran and s/p dual-chamber (RA-RV) PPM in [**5-31**],
hypertension, and heart failure with preserved EF (EF 55% on
[**2119-6-28**] TTE but normal E wave, low deceleration time 133 msec)
and moderate pulmonary hypertension by TTE (TR Gradient + RA =
PASP: 44 mm Hg) who presented to the ED with lower extremity
edema. She reported considerable problems with lower extremity
edema over the weeks preceding admission with an approximately
12-lb weight gain and [**2-23**] pillow orthopnea. She further reported
dyspnea on exertion but not at rest. She has also had two
admissions within the last six weeks for AF with RVR. She had
been doing reasonably well despite persistent lower extremity
edema until the day prior to admision when she tripped and was
unable to get herself off the floor for a few hours due to
weakness.

She denies having any shortness of breath, chest pain, dyspnea
on exertion or palpitations in association with this.  She
denies striking her head. Her grandson eventually was able to
help her to her feet and she seemed well without confusion so no
additional assistance was pursued at that time. She did report
three days of persistent cough, intermittently productive of
whitish sputum but denied any fevers. The morning after her fall
(the morning of admission), her family decided to bring her in
for further evaluation given her persistent cough and leg
swelling.

EKGs:
1. [**2119-6-26**]: Ventricular paced rhythm with a seven-beat run of an
irregular intrinsic wide complex rhythm of uncertain mechanism
but may be atrial fibrillation. Intermittent atrial pacer
activity also appears to be present. Clinical correlation is
suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2119-5-27**] uniform atrial
pacing has been replaced by rhythm as outlined.
2. [**2119-7-11**]: Atrial paced rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific but cannot
exclude myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested.
Since the previous tracing of [**2119-6-26**] atrial pacing is now
present throughout and ventricular pacing is not seen.
.
Tib/Fib XRay ([**2119-6-26**]):  No acute fracture or dislocation in
either tibia or fibula.
.
Right Shoulder XRay ([**2119-6-26**]): No acute fracture or dislocation.
Findings suggestive of underlying rotator cuff disease.
.
Relevant CXR:
1. [**2119-6-26**]: Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral
pleural effusions. Opacities within the lung bases may represent
atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
2. [**2119-6-27**]: Bilateral pleural effusions blunt the pleural sinuses
and obliterate the diaphragmatic contours. They also conceal
major portions of the cardiac silhouette which undoubtedly
represents marked cardiac enlargement. The pulmonary vasculature
is congested with perivascular haze and hazy peripheral
densities in the mid lung field which have now increased in
comparison with the last study and suggest development of
pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax has developed. There is no
evidence of central airway occlusion and occlusion atelectasis
related to mucus airway plugging. Comparison is made with
multiple chest examinations obtained during the last week and
they disclose findings consistent with CHF, continues
progression of pulmonary congestion.
3. [**2119-7-5**]: There is no pulmonary edema or appreciable pulmonary
vascular engorgement.  Bilateral pleural effusions,
moderate-to-large on the right and moderate on the left are
stable, obscuring cardiac silhouette, which is probably enlarged
but not changed in the interim. Right PIC line can be traced to
the upper right atrium. No pneumothorax.
.
TTE ([**2119-6-28**]):
Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is
no ventricular septal defect. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-22**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2119-5-9**], the estimated PA systolic
pressure is lower.
.
TTE ([**2119-7-11**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). R
