Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Right Hip Fracture s/p Fall Out Of Scooter

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intramedullary rod fixation of right peritrochanteric hip
fracture.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 year-old woman who presents with a R
intertrochanteric femur fracture after a mechanical fall from
her scooter.  She was initially admitted to the ICU in the
setting of apneic/hypoxic episodes presumed to be from narcotics
(she apparently received 3mg IV hydromorphone at OSH ED and 1mg
additional at [**Hospital1 18**] ED).

On [**3-19**], she was electively intubated and went to the OR for
intramedullary rod fixation of the right hip fracture. She was
kept intubated overnight and extubated this am without event.
For hct drop, she was transfused 1 unit pRBCs this am, with
subsequent stable hct. In the ICU, her SBP has been persistently
in the 90s, although she remains asymptomatic with good UOP.

On arrival to the floor, she noted [**6-24**] hip pain, but denied
fever, chills, night sweats, chest pain, shortness of breath,
cough, wheeze, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, dysuria, black or bloody stools, lightheadedness
or dizziness.   This morning she reports good control of her
pain.

Studies:

[**2124-3-18**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave changes in the
lateral leads. No previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2124-3-18**] Chest Xray: Single portable chest radiograph is reviewed.
The lung volumes are low. Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged,
though abundantly exaggerated by technique. There is increased
opacity at the left base, increased from one day prior. This may
reflect atelectasis, although evolving pneumonia is not
excluded. It appears to be a mild degree of volume overload,
without large effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Marked
degenerative changes are identified in the visualized thoracic
spine.

[**2124-3-19**] Right femur xray: Eight intraoperative radiographs were
performed in the operating room for operative assistance without
a radiologist present. These demonstrate an intratrochanteric
right proximal femoral fracture, which appears comminuted. There
is evidence of placement of a gamma nail fixation with a long
femoral intramedullary rod. Pre-existing right total knee
arthroplasty is evident. For full details, please consult the
operative report.

[**2124-3-21**] Chest Xray (preliminary read): S/p removal of ET tube, no
other significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 year old female with CAD s/p MI, chronic diastolic CHF and
psoriasis who presented after a scooter accident with right hip
fracture now s/p repair.

#. Closed femur fracture with acute blood loss anemia:
She presented with right hip fracture and underwent surgical
repair on [**2124-3-19**] without complication.  She was given 1 unit of
packed red cells post-operatively for a small hematocrit drop
and her hematocrit subsequently remained stable.  She was
started on SC heparin instead of Lovenox given her acute renal
failure for DVT prophylaxis.  She is weight bearing as tolerated
on both lower extremities.  She was seen by the physical therapy
team who recommended rehab placement.  Her pain was controlled
post-operatively with standing Tylenol and oxycodone.

#. Hypoxia:
She was mildly hypoxic post-operatively felt to be due to a
combination of CO2 retention in the setting of OSA, atelectasis,
and narcotic use for pain.  She refused to wear CPAP during this
admission and her oxygen requirements decreased
post-operatively.  At discharge she was still requiring 2L O2.
It is important for her to continue incentive spirometry after
discharge.

#. Acute on chronic kidney disease Stage III:
Her creatinine increased to 1.9 during this admission from a
presumed baseline of 1.3-1.5 of stage III CKD.  We were unable
to validate her baseline creatinine and her kidney function
should be followed after discharge.  Her creatinine improved to
1.3 with IV fluid hydration post-operatively and it was felt
that she had prerenal azotemia in the setting of her hip
fracture.  Her outpatient [**Last Name (un) **] was restarted prior to discharge
but held during most of her stay.

#. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Uncontrolled with Complications:
She was managed with her home insulin regimen post-operatively.
Actos and glimeprimide were held during her stay but restarted
at discharge.

#. CAD s/p MI:
She would likely benefit from aspirin treatment as an outpatient
but this was deferred to her PCP.

#. Chronic diastolic CHF:
Her home Lasix dose was initially held due to acute renal
failure but was restarted prior to discharge.  She may need
better heart rate control to optimize her CHF treatment.

#. Benign Hypertension:
Her blood pressure was slightly elevated on admission and
post-operatively and her antihypertensives were restarted prior
to discharge.

#. Hyperlipidemia: She was continued on her statin and her
fenofibrate was held during this admission.

#. Gout: Continued on allopurinol.

#. Psoriasis c/b RLE ulcers: She receives methotrexate weekly
which she was not due for during this hospitalization.  It
should be resumed at discharge although her dose could not be
confirmed during her stay as her primary care doctor's office
was closed.

#. Prior cellulitis:
She reported recent antibiotic use on admission for a possible
cellulitis although had no signs of cellulitis on physical exam.
 She was given antibiotics perioperatively and then was not
continued on them
