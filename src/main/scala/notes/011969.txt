Pertinent Results:
[**2149-4-11**] Intra-op TEE
Conclusions
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is normal in size. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 45 %). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade
I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. A pacing for slow sinus
rhythm. Preserved bivenntricular systolic function post CPB.
LVEF is now 55-65%. MR remains mild. Aortic contour is normal
post decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr.[**Known lastname **] was brought to the operating room on [**2149-4-11**] where he
underwent coronary artery bypass x 3 by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] as detailed in
the operative report.  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  He  was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor
support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  POD#1 he was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  The remainder of his
hospital course was essentially uneventful.

By the time of discharge on POD #4 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
