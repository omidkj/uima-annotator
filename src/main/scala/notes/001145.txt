Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 70 YOM with known pancreatic CA s/p multiple CBD
stents who presented with sepsis.
==================
Prior to presentation the patient had fevers and was
hypotensive.  His PCP ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CT of the torso which showed
bilateral pneumonia and no intra-abdominal process.  On
presentation the patient was in septic (spiking fevers and
hypotensive).  The patient was started on Levo/Clinda.  Despite
this intervention he continued to have increased respiratory
distress.
==================
Course in the ED
In the ED the patient was hypotensive with SBPs in the 60. The
rest of his vitals were stable. Lactate was 1.9. Central access
was obtained and the patient received vanc/lev/flagyl. The
patient received 4L of NS with CVP of [**7-18**] and MAP of 55-58.
Levophed was started. Of note the patient also had increased
drainage of his G/J tube.
==================
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient's hypotension resolved and he was weaned
off of pressors. Surgery replaced his G/J tube with a G tube. TF
were resumed. Throughout his course in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient
remained tachypneic and tacchycardic.
.
Prelim blood cultures were identified as growing gram positives.
 As a result the patient was maintained on vancomycin. This was
later identified as B. fragilis. The vancomycin was d/c and the
patient was started on metronidazole. The cefepime was d/c 1.26
and levofloxacin started. If the patient became hypotensive or
spike fevers (started to look septic) the plan was to resend
cultures and try a stress dose of steroids.
.
On this regimen of Abx the patient clinically improved.  He
remained afebrile and was called out to the floor.  On the floor
multiple issues were addressed.
==================
#Nausea - The patient had his G/J tube removed and a G tube
placed on admission.  He tolerated this for a short time. There
were no signs of obstruction.  He was restarted tube feeds with
out complication but at a slower rate.  Ativan for nausea.
.
#Tachpnea - The patient developed hypoxia and dyspnea [**2-11**] COPD
and PNA.  He changed his code to DNR/DNI on admission and was
treated w/ abx and supplemetal O2.  After an episode of
desaturation to the 80s requiring NRB O2 therapy, his code
status was again addressed and the patient and his family
decided to focus on comfort rather than cure.  He completed a
course of abx and was maintained on his nebulizer treatments and
supplemental oxygen for comfort.  He was given morphine as well
for respiratory discomfort.
.
#Hyponatremia - The patient has a chronic hyponatremia per OMR
records.  He was originally fluid restricted after osms showed
SIADH pathology but this restriction was lifted as his code
status changed.
.
#Anemia - Chronic problem that was stable after transfusion.
.
#Pancreatic cancer - Pt has no oncologist and did not undergoing
treatment. The PCP and family treated his symtpoms as an
outpatient with goal of comfort not cure. The palliative care
team followed the patient throughout his course and was
invaluable in end of life discussions and d/c planning.  He was
provided morphine, ativan, and compazine prn for symptomatic
control.
.
# Code Status: The patient was made DNR/DNI on admission and,
after discussion with the patient and family, he was changed to
comfort measures only on the floor and was sent t
