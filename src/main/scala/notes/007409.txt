Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
70M Cape-Verdean speaking with h/o DM, HTN, PVD s/p bilateral
BKA (Right [**2105-5-13**]) and ESRD s/p LUE fistula [**2105-5-22**], recent
admission for altered mental status presents with intermittent
CP and SOB x 3 days. The patient is a poor historian. He
describes the onset of palpitations 3 days ago, which on further
history reports as substernal chest pain. Denies any radiation,
SOB, nausea, or diaphoresis. The episode lasted 30-60 min and
resolved. He had repeat episodes yesterday and then today when
he was brought into the ED by his son. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **], fever, chills,
SOB, HA, nausea/vomiting. Continues to make urine, perhaps
slightly increased amount recently but no dysuria.
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted ([**Date range (1) 35542**]) for
altered mental status thought to be multifactorial from
medication confusion/noncompliance, severe hypertension at
presentation, and vomiting/minimal po intake; his confusion
improved prior to discharge. He also had bilious nausea/vomiting
with KUB and CT abdomen/pelvis negative for obstruction that
then resolved, hypertensive urgency, and isolated leukocytosis
(WBC 17) without obvious signs for infection and therefore not
treated.
.
In the ED, vitals: T 96.0 HR 84 BP 136/58 RR 16 SaO2 86 on RA ->
97% on 4.5L. Noted to be tachypnea intermittently to RR 32. ECG
nondiagnostic with LVH with repol changes, worsening ST
depressions laterally and positive troponin but normal CK. ABG
7.53/27/58; lactate 1.6; WBC 15.3; BNP [**Numeric Identifier 35543**]. CXR with ?left
infiltrate vs. pulmonary edema. Pt received Lasix 20mg IV, ASA
325mg, and Levaquin 500mg PO. He adamantly refused blood cxs
prior to antibiotics.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 y/o M with PMHx of DM, CRI, CAD, PVD s/p b/l BKA who was
initially admitted on [**2105-6-18**] for NSTEMI and CHF that was later
felt to be due to demand ischemia from CHF rather than plaque
rupture. While on the floor was refusing lab draws and
echocardiogram to assess resolution of NSTEMI. His hospital
course was then complicated by 2 embolic strokes on [**6-22**] (R
parietal and L frontal lesion) which caused him to become
aphasic and develop R sided weakness. He did not receive any
thrombolysis, and coumadin was held as felt risk on
anticoagulation outwayed the benefits. He has ESRD but not
getting dialysis yet as making urine, has a working fistula on R
arm. On [**6-28**] he was intubated and transfered to the ICU for
Urosepsis. He was treated with Meropenem, extubated, and
transfered out of the ICU and back to the medical floor. While
in the ICU a double lumen PICC was placed.
.
On the medical floor a PEG tube was placed and dispo planning
was in process until [**2105-7-11**] AM when he was found to be grunting
and coughing. At that time Lasix was given for fluid overload
and enzymes were cycled. His EKG showed suggestion of anterior
STEMI with no reciprocal changes, cardiology evaluated this and
felt it was most likely a NSTEMI. They felt that no further
intervention was warented. His troponin bumped to 1.49 and then
2.75 without an increase in his MB fraction. He was started on
Heparin for anticoagulation.
.
At 6:30 AM on [**2105-7-12**] a trigger was called for hypoxia and
tachypnia. Per the vitals sheet her O2 sat had dropped at 4:30AM
to 80s however he was due for transfusion which was started and
respiratory status worsened. The blood transfusion was stopped
and he was placed on 100% on shovel mask with sats recorded at
86%, he was then placed on NRB with sats up to 97%. He was given
100mg Lasix and 500mg Diurel. He was then transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
management of pulmonary edema.
.
On the evening of [**2105-7-12**] he again developed acute respiratory
failure.  He was intubated.  A family meeting was held [**7-13**], and
the decision was made to make the patient DNR, and to not pursue
any further escalation of care (no pressors, no dialysis).  A
seconde family meeting was held on [**7-15**], and the decision was
made to make the patient comfort measures only.  He was
extubated in the evening of [**7-15**].  He died at 0600 on [**2105-7-16**].
His son, [**Name (NI) **], was contact[**Name (NI) **] at the time of death.
