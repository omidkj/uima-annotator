none


History of Present Illness:
63 yo female with history of DM2, Htn, COPD, question of CRI who
originally presented to PCP c/o severe dizziness and found to be
bradycardic (HR 30's) with associated junction escape rhythm,
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and admitted to the CCU for
close monitoring.  Per report, Pt was experiencing severe
fatigue and LH while at community center accompanied by SSCP and
SOB that resolved on its own over several minutes.  At PCP's
office this afternoon was found to be bradycardic with HR in
30's and an ECG with a junctional rhythm and no sinus activity.
In the ED recieved atropine twice and calcium gluconate without
effect.  Several ECGs obtained which showed evidence of a sinus
rhythm in 20-40s with a narrow junctional escape and
intermittent AV conduction.  Per EP, bradycardic agents were
held and Pt transferred to CCU for further evaluation.

CXR
FINDINGS: Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are within
normal limits. There is perivascular haze and increased
prominence of the interstitial markings, consistent with CHF.
There are no pleural effusions. Osseous structures are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Mild CHF pattern


Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo female with h/o multiple CV risk factors including DM2,
HTn as well as CRI and COPD admitted to CCU for symptomatic
bradycardia.

1) Rhythm:  In both the PCPs office and [**Name (NI) **], Pt found to be in
sinus brady with junctional escape and intermittent AV
conduction thought to be secondary to blockade from her regimen
of BB and CCB.  Those medications were held and Pt received
atropine times two with no effect.  EP cosulted who recommended
admission to CCU for close monitoring.  Given Pt's slow native
sinus rhythm and no evidence of AV conduction block, it was not
necessary for a temporary pacer wire to be placed.  Overnight Pt
reverted to a faster NSR at rate in the 80's.  Pt
hemodynamically stable and without further complaint of
dizziness or fatigue.  Given response, above agents continued to
be held and HCTZ slowly added for BP control.

2) CAD: Pt with multiple risk factors but no known heart
disease.  ECG without ischemic changes and cardiac enzymes
remained flat.  History of modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol stopped after
4 minutes secondary to fatigue with no obvious ischemic changes.
Pt educated and instructed to stop smoking.

3) Pump: Pt with eMIBI ([**5-22**]) with estimated LVEF to be 75%.  Pt
with history of HTn controlled in past with BB, CCB and ACEi. On
admission BB/CCB held for bradycardia and ACEi held initial for
h/o CRI while awaiting lab results.  For BP control, Pt started
initially on low dose HCTZ and titrated to 25mg daily for which
she will be discharged home on.  For addition control especially
given history of DM, felt it was important to restart Pt's ACEi.
 However given Pt's admission hyperkalemia, it was initially
held.  The follow up K+ were normal and Cr normal.  So Pt
restarted on lisinopril at 2.5 mg daily, less than her
preadmission regimen of 5mg daily.  Pt should be followed up
closely by PCP who will titrate her antihypertensives and
increase her ACE as tolerated by BP and K+.

4) Hyperkalemia: On presentation to the ED had a K+ of 6.6 and
5.7 for which she received kayexelate twice.  Repeat K= 3.9 and
remained normal remaining of hospitalization.  Because of
hyperkalemia, lisinopril was added on at low dose of 2.5 mg
daily with plans for outpatient titration.

5) CRI:  Pt with h/o CRI and reported baseline Cr 1.5 and on
admission was found to 1.7.  Pt lightly hydrated overnight and
Cr in AM improved to 1.2.  Pt remained stable with good UOP.
Given Cr 1.0-1.2 felt it was appropriate to restart Pt's
lisinopril.

6) COPD: Pt with h/o COPD treated as an outpt with Advair and
Combivent.  This regmen was continued, however felt to be a bit
more wheezy and thus increased her frequency of treatment.  Pt
did well and remained stable titrateing off her O2
supplementation.  Pt to be discharged home on her pre-admission
regimen.
