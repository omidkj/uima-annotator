Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Presyncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
RVOT VT ablation ([**2181-7-23**])


History of Present Illness:
82M with hx of CAD s/p DES to RCA [**2-18**], hx of symptomatic MR,
s/p MR repair with [**Company 1543**] ring placement with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1916**]
ligation with subsequent hx of NSVT s/p briefly on sotalol and
metoprolol, later placed on Amiodarone, recently down titrated
from 200mg to 100mg daily, that is presenting with presyncopal
like episode. The pt is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 2025**] and his
amiodarone has been titrated down over due to pt concerns for
toxicity. The pt was was due to be placed on a Holter monitor
this coming Monday but this has not been performed yet.

Pt reports that for the last three days he has decreased energy.
He denied chest pain, sob, nausesa or emesis. He states that
today, while sitting as his computer, he had visual changes and
felt as though he was going to pass-out. He denies LOC. He
subsequently called EMS and was brought into the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

In the ED, initial vitals were 97.2 86 152/62 16 99%. Cardiac
exam notable for tachycardia. Labs notable for trop 0.02, Cr
1.6. Telemetry was notable for sustained VT. The pt was
amiodarone loaded with 150mg then started on 1mg/min gtt. The
sustained VT resolved prior to transfer to the CCU. Vitals prior
to transfer 97.1 86-140 99/64 18 99RA.

On arrival to the CCU the pt states he is tired but feels
otherwise fine.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Studies:
CXR ([**2181-7-22**])
There is stable mild cardiomegaly. Retrocardiac opacification
likely represents atelectasis, however underlying infectious
process cannot be completely excluded. No evidence of focal
consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Partially
visualized sternotomy wires appear midline and intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
82M with coronary artery disease s/p DES to RCA in [**2179**] and
mitral regurgitation s/p [**Company 1543**] ring placement with course
complicated by NSVT post surgery.  He has been on sotalol in the
past and amiodarone most recently for suppression of his NSVT.
He was admitted with monomorphic VT of same morphology as his
NSVT in setting of decreasing his amiadorone dose.

1. RHYTHM: Stable inferior axis monomorphic ventricular
tachycardia likely from right ventricular outflow tract.  It
could also be due scar from his mitral valve ring placement.
With long half life of amiodarone unlikely related to decreasing
amiodarone dose.  He was started on amiodarone drip on admission
without any effect on NSVT.  Amiodarone drip was discontinued
and uptitrated metoprolol to 50 mg po BID which helped suppress
NSVT.  No evidence of ischemia as precipitant for his
ventricular tachycardia.  TSH within normal range. He underwent
EP Study on [**2181-7-24**] with ablation of RVOT.  He tolerated the
procedure well without any complications.

2. CORONARIES: Single vessel disease RCA disease per last cath.
s/p DES to RCA in [**2179**].  ECG without new ST-T changes. Troponin
negative. He was continued on aspirin, statin, B-Blocker and
ACE-I.

3. PUMP: Last known EF 55%. Pt appears clinically euvolemic.

4. Glaucoma: Stable.  Continued on home eye drops.

Secondary Diagnsois
1. Coronary artery disease


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with abnormal rhythm called monomorphic
ventricular tachycardia which was causing you chest discomfort.
Electrophysiology study showed a focus in your heart that
started your abnormal rhythm which was ablated.  You tolerated
the procedure well without any complications.
