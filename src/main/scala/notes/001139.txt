IMAGING
==================
[**2131-11-6**]
- CXR: Left lower lobar collapse with small pleural effusion.
Diaphragmatic injury from procedure is possible, but unlikely.

[**2131-11-9**]
- CXR: Increased moderate biventricular congestive heart
failure.

- Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild anterior leaflet
mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, inferolaterally directed
jet of mild-moderate ([**12-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to
the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mitral valve prolapse with at least mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Compared
with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-7-6**], the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher. The
other findings are similar.

PATH [**2131-11-6**]:
1.7cm colonic adenocarcinoma
T1N1aMx; [**1-9**] lymph nodes positive

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo Spanish speaking M w/ colon adenocarcinoma (dx in [**8-7**]),
DM, CAD s/p stent LAD/first diag ([**2123**]), SVT s/p ablation, HTN,
DLP, CRI (Cr 1.4) s/p left colectomy with component
separation/ventral hernia repair, drainage of abcess related to
old abdominal mesh.  Immediate postoperative course c/b
hypertension, tachycardia, and hypoxia transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further care.  Consults were obtained from the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU,
cardiology and geriatrics for assistance with this patient's
care.

Neuro: Pre-operatively, an epidural was placed for pain control.
 Post-operatively, the patient continued with epidural
anesthesia with good effect and adequate pain control. Epidural
was removed on POD4 and pain control managed with intermittent
morphine IV.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient was
transitioned to oral pain medications.  Per recommendations from
geriatrics, narcotic pain medications were discontinued on POD9
secondary to increased risk delirium in geriatric population.
Pain control then managed with non-narcotic po medication.

CV: The patient was initially hypertensive postoperatively but
then became hypotensive likely secondary to CHF.  Cardiac
enzymes were drawn times three to rule out myocardial infarction
and they were negative.  A cardiology consult was sought on
POD3, there assessment was that underlying mitral regurgitation,
continued hypertension, and overall positive fluid balance since
surgery were contributing to his CHF picture.  A TTE was
obtained on POD3 and results are above.  Patient was found to be
intermittently in atrial fibrillation and recommendations per
cardiology were followed-beta blocker, amlodipine were titrated
to appropriate heart rate and blood pressure.  Patient's fluid
balance was carefully monitored and he intermittently received
lasix vs fluid to achieve euvolemia such that he was adequately
supported from a cardiovascular standpoint without fluid
overload compromising his pulmonary status.  Patient also was
transfused packed RBCs when appropriate to maintain adequate
volume status without fluid overload.  Patient's vital signs
were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: Postoperatively, patient required non-rebreather in
ICU setting to maintain oxygenation.  As patient was diuresed
oxygen requirement diminished and patient was transferred to
floor on POD6 on supplemental oxygen via nasal canula and
intermittent nebulizer treatments for shor
