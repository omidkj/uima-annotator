History of Present Illness:
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A PT. OF DR. [**First Name (STitle) 1955**] [**Doctor Last Name 3566**].

This is an 81 year-old man with a history of hypertension, prior
stroke with resultant right hemiparesis, dementia, and multiple
other medical problems who presented after being found down by
his caretaker.

Per the patient's caretaker, he was last seen doing well at noon
on the day of admssion, ate lunch brought to him. His caretaker
checked in on him around 10pm and he was found down on the
ground incontinent of urine and feces, not talking but eyes
open. She did not notice if any extremities were moving less
well than others. She pushed the "alert button" on him and EMS
arrived and brought him to [**Hospital1 18**].

Here in [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his finger stick was 135, 2mg narcan did not
change his status, and he was found to be febrile to 101.6
rectal. Received 2g ceftriaxone and 1 gram of vancomycin.

The pt's caregiver says at baseline he walks unaided, bathes
himself. He is incontinent of urine and sometimes stool and will
not wear diaper because "those are for old people." The
caretaker makes his meals, does his finances, administers his
meds and takes him to all his appointments. He is not oriented
to year at baseline, but is talkative/conversant. One side
(caretaker cannot remember which side) is weaker than the other
at baseline. When he wants to get in touch with his caretaker,
he calls the operator and racks up
large phone bills doing so (caretaker lives across the street).
.
On admission, the pt's caretaker stated he has not had any
complaints of recent, no illnesses or complaints of pain.

NEURO:
MENTAL STATUS: partially opens eyes to voice and begins shaking
his head in a no/no pattern, does not follow midline or axial
commands, does not speak.
CRANIAL NERVES:
Pupil exam: 1mm bilaterally and minimally reactive
Fundi: unable to see, very small pupils
EOM exam: eyes midline as patient moves head in "no-no"
pattern, no eye deviation, patient awake thus unable to dolls.
Corneal reflex: present bilaterally, nasal tickle present as
well.
Facial symmetry: nasolabial folds appear symmetric, upper face
slightly asymmetric as has a scar over left eyelid
Gag reflex: not tested at this time
MOTOR:
- tone: decreased right arm, increased left arm and bilateral
lower
extremities
- no adventious movements
- moves left side more so than the right as will elevate left
arm
at the elbow against gravity and pick at gown with left hand,
flexes left knee. Moves right arm proximally and wiggles fingers

spontaneously.
SENSORY: withdraws and localizes with left pinch, arm and leg.
Decerebrate postures with right arm. Less vigorous withdrawl
right leg.

CXR:No priors available for comparison. The heart is enlarged.
The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unremarkable allowing
for technique. There is subtle basilar patchy opacity, which is
likely secondary to crowding of vessels on this portable film,
however aspiration is not excluded. The lungs are otherwise
clear.

CT c spine: Severe cervical spondylosis. No acute fracture
identified.

CT head: 1. Study limited by patient motion. 2. Given these
limitations, no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. 3.
Chronic microvascular infarction, without evidence of acute
infarction. If suspicion is high for this, MRI could be
obtained. 4. The ventricles appear mildly prominent, out of
proportion to the sulci. No old studies available to evaluate
for
acute change.

MRI could not be performed secondary to pt. motion.

EEG ([**2187-7-10**]): IMPRESSION: While this record could not be read in
its entirety, in those portions of the record that were
artifact-free, the only clear and definitive abnormality was
diffuse slowing and voltage reduction overall without evidence
for a convulsive disorder.

RIGHT WRIST, 2 VIEWS:

No previous films for comparison. No definite recent fractures.
There is an old healed fracture with deformity of the distal end
of the ulna and degenerative changes involving the radio- carpal
and several intercarpal joints with joint narrowing and
subchondral sclerosis. Degenerative changes also involve the
carpometacarpal joint of the first digit. Bones are well
mineralized and there are no discrete joint erosions.

IMPRESSION: Degenerative changes involving radiocarpal joint and
intercarpal joints as described with probable old healed
fracture of the distal ulna, but no definite recent fractures
and no joint erosions or soft tissue calcifications. Correlate
clinically, as no prior films for comparison.

RIGHT ELBOW TWO VIEWS:

No recent fracture. The bones are well mineralized. There is a
small olecranon spur. Degenerative changes are present with
marginal spur formation at the elbow joint.

Videoswallow
FINDINGS: Video fluoroscopic imaging was obtained in the lateral
projection. The patient swallowed thin and thick liquids,
pudding consistency, cookie consistency without evidence of
aspiration. A trace penetration was seen, but this cleared with
successive swallows. There is some pooling of secretions within
the vallecula. The oral phase of the swallow was slightly
delayed.
IMPRESSION: No aspiration

Conclusions:
1. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular  cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess but is
probably normal (LVEF>55%). Septal hypokinesis is present.
2. The right atrium is moderately dilated. The right ventricular
cavity is  dilated. There is severe global right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis.There  is abnormal septal motion
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume  overload.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral  regurgitation is seen.
5. Moderate [2+]
