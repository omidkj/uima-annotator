MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH MR ANGIOGRAPHY

HISTORY: Evaluate extent of diffuse axonal injury. Status post
motor vehicle collision.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was
obtained.

COMPARISON STUDY: CT scan of the same day.

FINDINGS: Previously noted multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages
as well as right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] hemorrhage are redemonstrated,
with probable additional tiny amounts of blood within the left
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. Tere are probable additional smaller areas of
hemorrhage within the cerebellum and throughout the cerebral
hemispheres, as seen on the susceptibility weighted scans. Also
noted is high T2 signal within the right side of the pons and
the left side of the splenium of the corpus callosum. Given the
history of major head trauma, these latter lesions presumably
represent nonhemorrhagic shear injuries, as well. There is no
hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures. There is
fairly extensive subgaleal swelling, somewhat more evident on
the left side, and most prominent on both sides near the
cerebral vertex.

CONCLUSION: More extensive shearing injury, both nonhemorrhagic
and hemorrhagic, compared to the recent CT scan, as noted above.

MR ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS TRIBUTARIES

TECHNIQUE: Three-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with
multiplanar reconstructions.

FINDINGS: The major vascular tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]
appear patent. There is no definite evidence for the presence of
vascular injury or aneurysm, within the limitations of this
modality.

INDICATION: Question [**Doctor First Name **] status post MVC and increasing rigidity
on exam in all extremities, evaluate pontine lesion, please
perform with gadolinium.

COMPARISON: MR brain dated [**2129-5-25**] and non-contrast head CT
dated [**2129-6-3**].

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed
through the brain prior to and following the administration of
gadolinium. Diffusion- weighted imaging was performed.

MR OF THE BRAIN: The examination is markedly limited by patient
motion during image acquisition on nearly all sequences. A right
frontal subdural collection containing hemorrhagic products
which are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on gradient echo
sequences, is increased in size from the prior MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**5-25**] and
probably stable in size in comparison with the head CT of [**6-3**], [**2128**]. Multiple bilateral foci of intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, as well as hemorrhage within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the right lateral ventricle, appear stable in size. T2
hyperintensity and small focus of hemorrhage within the
splenium, consistent with patient's known diffuse axonal injury,
appear unchanged. Evaluation of the signal abnormality within
the right pons, which appears contiguous with signal abnormality
involving the right internal capsule, is somewhat limited due to
motion artifact, although probably unchanged. No new areas of
intracranial hemorrhage are identified. There is no
hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures. No areas
of abnormal enhancement are identified within the brain
parenchyma following the administration of gadolinium, although
evaluation is limited by motion artifact. There is probable
dural enhancement about the right convexity at the site of the
subdural collection. No areas of slowed diffusion are identified
to suggest a new acute minor or major vascular territorial
infarct.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right subdural hematoma, increased since [**5-25**] but probably
unchanged since [**2129-6-3**].
2. Unchanged bilateral parenchymal hemorrhages and
intraventricular hemorrhage.
3. Edema within the splenium of the corpus callosum as well as
within the right pons and internal capsule, consistent with
patient's diffuse axonal injury, are probably unchanged allowing
for technical limitations due to marked patient motion.

MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]:

TECHNIQUE: 3D time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
reconstructions.

MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS TRIBUTARIES: The vessels of
the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and its major tributaries are patent
without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis,
occlusion, or aneurysm.

IMPRESSION: Normal circle of [**Location (un) 431**] MRA.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN

Reason: [**Location (un) **] obstruction

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
23 year old man with diffuse axonal injury s/p open G-tube
placement, with emesis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
[**Hospital **] obstruction
INDICATION: 70-year-old male with head trauma, NG tube
placement. Patient presents with hematemesis.

COMPARISONS: Comparison is made to [**2129-6-19**].

TECHNIQUE: AP supine single view of the abdomen.

FINDINGS: The NG tube is in unchanged position in the left mid
abdomen. There is again noted contrast within the colon. The IVC
filter is in place. No dilated loops of small bowel are seen.
The NG tube has been removed.

IMPRESSION:

No dilated loops of small bowel to suggest SBO.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service. Once stabilized in the
Emergency room he was taken to the Trauma ICU. Neurosurgery was
immediately consulted because of his head injury. He underwent
further imaging of his head; MRA did not reveal any vascular
injuries; MRI of the head did reveal diffuse axonal injury. His
injuries were nonoperative. Mannitol was given for diuresis. He
was also placed on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis; this was
eventually discontinued. He will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 63264**] in 3 months with repeat head imaging.

He remained in the ICU for several weeks; he initially had
problems with elevated heart rate and blood pressure; both
improved with IV Lopressor and Hydralazine. A tracheostomy and
PEG were placed on [**5-30**]; he was eventually weaned off the
ventilator. He remained in the ICU for sev
