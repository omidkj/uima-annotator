History of Present Illness:
76F with severe R sided CHF, pulm HTN, 3+TR, ILD [**12-25**] amio
toxicity on 3L home O2, afib presents with SOB and rising
creatinine. Of note, the patient was only discharged from [**Hospital1 18**]
yesterday after she was treated from [**4-8**] to [**4-19**] for
progressive dyspnea [**12-25**] pulm HTN and R heart failure. She was
evaluated by the pulmonary consult service who pursued a trial
of sildenafil which the patient did not tolerate due to
orthostatic hypotension. She found the BiPAP mask uncomfortable.
Digoxin was added to her medication regimen with what was felt
to be a good effect. Her hospital course was remarkable for
tenuous oxygenation status requiring repositioning bed to
improve sats, low blood pressures with SBP in 80s - 90s, and low
urine output. UOP was noted to be 200 cc/day with a creatinine
that remained stable at baseline of 0.5-0.7 until the day of
discharge when it was noted to be 1.7, the plan was to monitor
this closely at the rehab.
At rehab, the creatinine was noted to be rising and the pt
developed SOB. She returned to the ED for further evaluation and
treatment. In the ED, initial vitals were t 97.5 p 64 bp 117/76,
rr 16 99 on NRB. She was given vanc, zosyn to treat a possible
PNA. CXR showed increasing bilateral effusions, no evidence of
acute CHF or PNA. There was no fever or leukocytosis. Creatinine
was noted to be up to 2.7. ABG was 7.33/69/87. She was infused
700 cc NS. She was admitted to MICU team for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
76F with severe R sided CHF, pulm HTN, 3+TR, ILD [**12-25**] amio
toxicity on 3L home O2, afib presents with SOB and rising
creatinine. She had baseline severe pulm HTN with RV failure,
3+TR. There was an attmpt to optimize renal status. She likely
had poor renal perfusion from severe RV failure/pulm HTN leading
to poor LV preload. Urine sediment appeared c/w ATN. She was
also noted to have transaminitis likely [**12-25**] congestive
hepatopathy. Had hep serologies last admission which were
negative. RUQ ultrasound [**2163-4-9**] showed no significant
pathology. Unfortunately, during her admission, her respiratory
status could not be stabilized and her creatininte continued to
rise. Her family decided to tranistion her to comfort measures
and she passed away on [**2163-4-22**].
