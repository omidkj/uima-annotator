History of Present Illness:
73 year old male with history of Parkinson's disease, CKD(Cr bl
4), CHF 25-30%, and recent intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)
presenting with worsening hallucinations. Pt transferred from
[**Hospital1 **] for concerns of worsening head bleed. Recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 112**] [**5-27**] with head bleed 1 week after fall. Treated
for PNA and UTI and discharged 9 days ago although family does
not feel patient had recovered. He was treated with CTX and
azithro and discharged on levaquin which the family could only
get filled as moxiflox and nitrofuratoin. Labs there were
notable on admission for WBC 2.32 Plts 117 Cr of 4.89 BUN 80 and
80/4.63 with WBC of 2.08 Plts 104 on discharge [**5-30**]. His UCx
grew beta hemolytic strep [**5-28**]. Also of note, pt was admitted to
[**Hospital1 **] 5 weeks ago for lethargy and started on levothyroxine
at that point.
.
He saw his PCP 1 week ago for hallucinations and was started on
seroquel which reportedly made him worse and was stopped. Today
family noted him to have increased confusion, agitation, and
hallucinations including seeing mice and bunnies running around
the floor in past 3 days. At OSH found CT read as new small
acute hemorrhage in right upper subinsular area and interval
resolution of previously noted small hemorrhage in the left
centrum semi-ovale. Also found to be hypothermic to 92.9,
bradycardia (55-60) with pressures holding at 140s-150s. No
rigors or fevers. Urine, blood pending. No headache or meningeal
signs. Asterixis suggestive of encephalopathy.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, 93.6 57 138/91 18 100%2L. Pt denies any
complaints. FSBS 135. Blood, urine sent. Put on warming blankets
and repeat head CT ordered. Neurology felt c/w encephalopthy.
Head bleed very small and prob HTN related and needs sepsis w/u.
BP goal less than 160/90. Labs notable for Cr 4.3(bl 4), wbc
2.2. Given zosyn and vanc for empiric sepsis. CXR showed right
middle/lower lobe infiltrate vs volume overload. Given
Haloperidol for CT scan.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient was noted to be alert and
nor responsive with twitching motions and internal rotation of
left arm. Question of seizure prompted eval by neuro who said
myoclonic jerks. Family also confirmed this was a change. Had
received haldol downstairs prior to coming up. Family reports
ongoing cough and hallucination (picking at paper towel last
night) and a fall last night as well.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 year old male with history of Parkinson's disease, CKD(Cr bl
4), CHF 25-30%, and recent ICH presenting with worsening
hallucinations.  The patient's altered mental that was felt to
be related to an encephalopathy, exacerbated by pneumonia and by
sedating medications given in the emergency department. The tiny
foci of question intracranial hemorrhage were not felt to be
contributing and later scans showed no change, suggestiing this
was more likely calcifcation than bleed. The patient was treated
for pneumonia as below. The neurology service was consulted and
recommended MRI, which the patient refused and follow-up CT was
performed instead, which was stable.  The patient waxed and
waned throughout his course in terms of attention, agitation,
orientation and hallucinations.  He was intermittently agitated
and physically combative to staff. Seroquel caused him to be
nearly unresponsive. After discussion with neurology, including
his movement specialist, chemical restraints were avoided at
this point in favor of soft mechanical restraints. He
intermittently required soft restraints for agitation. His
mental status did not improve with treatment of his pneumonia,
he was given vancomycin and zosyn for 8 days, and holding
sedating medications. He had a PEA arrest on [**6-19**], was
intubated, extubated per the family's wishes and expired several
hours later.
.
#RLL infiltrate: The patient was treated with vancomycin and
Zosyn IV for 8 days, with resolution of symptoms.
.
#CKD: Per report Cr 4.0 at baseline, etiology unclear/unknown
but likely component of DM, HTN. The creatinine was 4.3 on
admission and increased throughout hospitalization to a peak of
7.0 on [**6-16**], thought to be due to reduced po intake causing
intravascular volume depletion and pre-renal acute renal
failure. There was no evidence of obstruction. He was given
gentle IV fluids to support his rena
