Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
heart failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Attempted right heart catheterization


History of Present Illness:
71 yo M h/o severe dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p mechanical AVR, AFib on
coumadin, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG, 3rd-degree heart block
s/p ppm, and [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from OSH for further management of
chronic diastolic congestion heart failure.
.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2129-3-7**] to
[**2129-3-17**] for altered mental status and failure to thrive. The
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by
healthcare-associated pneumonia, which was treated with
ceftriaxone and vancomycin. The patient was discharged to Life
Care Center of [**Location (un) 2199**]. At the time, his weight was documented
as 161 lb.
.
At rehab, the patient was initially doing well. He was even able
to walk with a walker. Beginning around [**3-26**], however, the
patient's family began to notice increasing fatigue along with
intermittent confusion, agitation, poor sleep and poor appetite.
The family also described [**10-18**] second periods of tachypnea
occurring at 5-minute intervals. The family also describes
increased swelling in the patient's face and belly. In the early
morning of [**3-29**], the patient was noted to be more confused,
leading him to present to [**Hospital 43018**] Hospital.
.
At Wincester, his initial weight was 165 pounds. The patient was
started on cefepime and linezolid for HCAP, although there was
no evidence of pneumonia. There was no documented fever or
leukocytosis. CT chest showed mediastinal adenopathy and
bilateral pleural effusions but no infiltrate. The patient was
diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV for presumed CHF in the ambulance
on the way to the hospital but did not receive further diuresis
in house due to concern for renal failure. There was an episode
of desaturation to 80% with confusion. Bronchodilators and IV
steroids were given for COPD. The patient was noted to have
mildly elevated bilirubin and alk phos. RUQ U/S was negative
Coumadin was held and a heparin gtt was started for
consideration of thoracentesis, which was not done prior to
transfer.
.
The patient was transferred directly to the CCU at [**Hospital1 18**]. On
arrival, initial vital signs were T 98.6 BP 112/68 HR 65 RR 23
Sat 98% 2L weight 174 pounds. Review of systems was not reliable
due to altered mental status. However, patient denied pain,
dyspnea, or other symptoms.

CXR (portable AP) [**2129-4-4**]: Cardiac silhouette has slightly
increased in size, and is accompanied by worsening pulmonary
vascular engorgement and increasing predominantly interstitial
edema. Additional areas of coalescing opacities in the
infrahilar region could reflect progression to alveolar edema.
Bilateral pleural effusions have increased in size, right
greater than left.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 43019**] is a 71-year-old man with a history of dCHF (EF>55%),
AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG, 3rd-degree heart
block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 43018**] Hospital for
consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension
in the setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.

Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure
  The patient presented with predominantly right-sided heart
failure with peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor
appetite, weight gain, and elevated JVP. He was diuresed with PO
torsemide without effect. The patient was then successfully
diuresed with Lasix 100mg IV BID. Metolazone was added however
the family warned that this can cause bumps in the creatinine,
which we have not noted, however today's creatinine was 1.7. The
patient's heart failure was thought to be end-stage, class 4
diastolic and pt has a poor prognosis. Palliative medicine
consult was considered however, the family was not interested in
this route and was more interested in aggressive medical
treatment more than symptom control. Metolazone (2.5 - 5 mg) 30
minuntes prior to Lasix affords improved diuresis, but has in
the past resulted in renal failure. This should be done
cautiously. When he approaches dry weight of just over 150 lbs,
he can be converted to an oral regimen of torsamide.

Altered mental status
  This was thought to be related to CHF encephalopathy or poor
forward flow in setting of heart failure. However, asterixis
also suggested a toxic-metabolic cause. Hypercarbia was ruled
out by ABG. Neurology was consulted and ruled out seizures by
negative EEG. Observation has revealed that mental status is
improved when pt is not fluid overloaded. It is very helpful his
family to be present to assist with orientation, particularly at
night.

Lateral abdominal hematoma
  The patient developed a lateral wall abdominal hematoma most
likely from trauma by leaning or hitting his flank on the bed
rail in the setting of agitation/delerium and supratherapeutic
INR. The patient's HCT dropped nearly 10 points from 34 to 24
and CT confirmed an extraperitoneal mus
