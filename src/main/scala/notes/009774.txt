Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Meperidine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4232**]
Chief Complaint:
hyponatremia, fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular central line


History of Present Illness:
89 yoF w/ a h/o CAD s/p CABG, HTN, PVD, CRI, AF s/p
cardioversion who is transferred from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for
hyponatremia. Patient's typical sodium in 130s to 140s. She was
recently started on hctz [**12-18**] and on [**12-23**] her Na was found to
be 125. Her hctz was stopped at that time and she was placed on
free H2O restriction. She then had a further decrease in her Na
to 122 today and patient was complaining of fatigue and mild
nausea. At [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] they were unable to gain IV access and
she was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Of note, she fell 2 days ago and
was seen in [**Hospital1 18**] where she had a head CT performed which was
unremarkable. Also of note, she has recently been complaining of
intermittent double vision. During her most recent admission she
was seen by optho and there was no evidence of diplopia; no
evidence of CN3,4,6 palsy.
.
Recent admission [**Date range (1) 39549**]/07 for SOB, palpitations, and LE
edema and was found to be in new AF in 120s. A TTE [**12-3**] and TEE
[**12-4**] showed evidence of severe MR with a tear on the mitral
chordae, EF >55%, 2+TR and moderate PAH. She was cardioverted on
[**12-4**], started on heparin, transitioned to coumadin, and also
started on amiodarone. She was thought to be volume overloaded
as well, possibly secondary to worsened MR and she was diuresed.

.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, T 98.4, BP 128/66, HR 68, RR 20, O2 96%RA. Patient
was mentating appropriately without other concerning symptoms.
Labs showed a sodium of 125, and a Cl of 90 but was otherwise
unremarkable. She received 1L NS in ED and was sent to the
floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 y.o. F with h/o CAD, s/p CABG '[**14**], PVD, new-onset afib [**11-12**]
s/p recent cardioversion, who presented with hyponatremia after
beginning HCTZ. Briefly transfered to MICU with hypotension
(never on pressors), then back to floor with stable vitals and
eunatremic. Hospital course by problem:
.
# Hyponatremia - Was likely secondary to overdiuresis with new
thiazide diuretic. Held HCTZ. Resolved with normal saline IVF,
with Na stable in low-normal range at discharge. Euvolemic on
exam. At presentation, uOsm was > 300 @ 581, with UNA @ 41 on
admission suggesting SIADH, but pt may still have been salt
wasting in setting of recent thiazide use. To promote
eunatremia, she should continue on a *free water* restriction
after discharge (note: not at the expensive of dehydration.
fluids with electrolyes are ok)
.
# Hypotension - Resolved with IVF, so was probably simple
hypovolemia. No leukocytosis. No fevers. U/A was negative, urine
cx with NGTD by discharge. No blood cx available, but very low
likelihood for infection as etiology for hypotension.
.
# O2 requirment: Only developed briefly after aggressive
hydration in MICU. Autodiuresed well with no clinical symptoms
of volume overload and had an O2 sat on room at of 96% at
discharge. Serial CXRs were largely unchanged.
.
# Diarrhea: Developed loose stool in the setting of MICU
transfer. Stool sent for C Diff but pt was empirically started
on Flagyl. Diarrhea has subsequently improved, but this is
confounded by the fact that she was put on Flagyl. Meanwhile,
first stool sample was negative for C Diff toxin. Given the
relatively high (~85%) sensitivity of this assay, it is very
unlikely that C diff was the etiology of her diarrhea. d/c
Flagyl on day of d/c (day #[**3-15**]) as it was unlikely to be
treating a true infection, and also it will greatly complicate
achieving a therapeutic INR for her (already on amiodarone!).
Patient should have 2 additional stool samples sent for formal C
Diff rule out as an outpatient.
.
# CKD: remained at baseline. Baseline 1.4 to 1.7.
.
# CAD, s/p CABG - no symptoms. Continued medical CAD regimen of
ASA, plavix, statin. After hypotension resolvedm, added low dose
beta blocker to CAD regimen
.
# Atrial Fibrillation - s/p cardioversion in early [**Month (only) 1096**].
Coumadin initially held for initial INR on presentation of 3.7.
Monitored on telemetry with NSR throughout. On discharge, INR
had dropped to 1.4, so restarted coumadin 2mg. INR to be checked
2 and 4 days after discharge, goal [**2-8**]. INR must be montored
carefully as pt is on amiodarone, with dosing to be tapered as
per discharge medications.
.
# Anemia: After placement of R IJ line in MICU stay, persistent
oozing was noted. FFP was given. Had slight HCT drop, and was
transfused 1 unit of PRBCs on [**12-28**] with a more than appropriate
bump in HCT. The drop was likely from oozing from central line
site. No other evidence of bleeding.
.
# Postnasal drip: persists. Continued flonase
.
# PVD - stable, continued pentoxifyline.
.
# FEN - Ate a regular, not salt restricted, diet. Initiated free
water restriction of 1500cc / day for possible SIADH (low
suspicion). Repleted lytes prn
