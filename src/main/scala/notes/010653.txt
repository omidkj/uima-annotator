Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BIPAP

History of Present Illness:
76 yo M w PMH of IPF, recent admission for SOB associated with a
plane flight r/o for PE, who was at his baseline of 6L O2 at
home when he developed worsening SOB and CP at home. He reports
slow decline in his baseline SOB and increase need for O2 in the
past few months, though this has acutely worsened in the last
2-3 days. This was accompanied by general fatigue and some
chills, but he denies fevers, cough, sputum production, sore
throat, arthralgias/myalgias, abd pain, diarrhea, dysuria. He
did have some nonpleuritic rightsided chest pain that was
related to exertion and resolved after about 20 minutes. It did
not radiate and resolved with morphine in the ED.
.
He went to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital **] Hospital where there was concern for a new
LLL pna. He was given 750mg of levofloxacin and 125mg solumedrol
IV. He was breathing 24-26x/min. He was sent here since he is
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] of pulmonology. Here, he was breathing
24-30 times per minute, using [**3-27**] word sentences. His
antibiotics were broadened to vanc/zosyn (only got vanc). He
improved on BIPAP to NRB and satting 92% on 6L. He remained
tachycardic, but o/w HD stable. He received about 500cc IVF. His
WBC was 12.4 (13 during last admission, thought [**2-25**] steroids),
lactate 1.4. Given concern for his work of breathing, he was
admitted to the ICU.
.
Prior to his last admission at [**Hospital1 18**], he did have an admission
in [**State 108**] in which he was given linezolid/levo for a pneumonia.

.
On the floor, he is on a BIPAP. He is speaking in full sentences
and tolerated weaning to facemask. He reports his SOB is worse
than baseline.

1. Progressive interstitial lung disease, almost certainly
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

3. Aortic stenosis with LVH.
4. abdominal aortic aneurysm that is 4 cm in diameter
5. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
6. Immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone and azathioprine.
7. Compression fractures


Social History:
Drinks 2 glasses of wine per night. The patient lives with his
wife in [**Name (NI) 912**]. He has 4 grown children. He worked for the

CXR [**2177-6-23**]:  IMPRESSION:
1. New opacity at the left lung base, concerning for pneumonia
in appropriate
clinical setting; however, atelectasis can have a similar
appearance.
2. Atelectasis at the right lung base.
3. Bilateral interstitial fibrosis.
.
CXR [**6-24**]:
IMPRESSION: Advanced interstitial pattern bilaterally consistent
with
diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. No evidence of new
discrete
parenchymal infiltrates. No new major pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 76 year old male with IPF on prednisone and
azathioprine, Bactrim PPX, exertional hypoxia, AS with LVH, AAA,
and pulmonary HTN, who was admitted for increased SOB likely due
to an exacerbation of his underlying pulmonary fibrosis.
.
#. SOB- He was admitted to the ICU The patient has end stage
pulmonary fibrosis on 5L of NC at home and therefore has poor
respiratory functional reserve.  The patient has had several
CXRs this admission which do not show any signs of infection.
It is also likely that his mild leukocytosis was due to an
increase in his steroid dosing.  His SOB this admission is
likely secondary to an IPF exacerbation which responded to
increased steroid dosing with a 3 day burst of prednisone 60mg
that was decreased down to his home prednisone 20mg dose prior
to discharge.  He was started on antibiotics on admission to
cover a hospital acquired pneumonia and he was continued on his
empiric antibiotics despite minimal evidence of infection given
that he has poor baseline pulmonary reserve.  He therefore was
continued on levofloxacin, linezolid, and cefepime to complete
an 8 day course at home.  Linezolid was chosen after the patient
developed an erythemic eruption on his chest and back while
being dosed with vancomyin in the ED.  He was continued on his
home azathioprine and bactrim prohylaxis.  He was set up for
home PT and home O2 of [**6-2**] Liters with a face mask upon
discharge.
.
#. Thrombocytopenia:  Felt to be secondary to PPI.  Resolved
since patient has been switched to H2 blocker.
.
#. Pancreatic ductal dilation: Per a prior discharge summary, he
should be scheduled for an outpatient CT abd/pelvis for further
evaluation and monitoring.
.
#. Aortic Stenosis: It does not seem like his aortic stenosis is
contributing to his current symptoms. Continued home ASA and
lasix.
.
#. Anemia- His hematocrit has drifted down from 40 earlier this
month to 38 on admission. He would likely benefit from having as
high a hematocrit as possible to give him maximal oxygen
carrying capacity in the setting of his chronic hypoxia.
Continue to monitor closely as an outpatient.
.
#. Anxiety - When the patient develops anxiety, he becomes short
of breath, tachypneic, and tachycardic.  It was noted that he
responded well to lorazepam 0.5mg PRN which relieved his anxiety
and improved his oxygen saturation.  He was discharged with a
new prescription for lorazepam 0.5mg q8 PRN.
.
#. Access: Right sided PICC placed [**6-24**]
