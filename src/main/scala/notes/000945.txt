Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Right upper lobe lung cancer.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2176-2-8**] Video-assisted thoracic surgery right
upper lobectomy, video-assisted thoracic surgery right lower

History of Present Illness:
76F who is a former smoker had a history of dry cough for the
past year. She saw her physician and had [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CXR, which showed a
RUL infiltrate. She was treated with antibiotics without
improvement. She then underwent a chest CT [**2175-5-4**], which
demonstrated a 5x3cm spiculated ilfiltrate in the RUL. She was
treated with another course of levo and had a repeat CT scan
[**2175-6-7**]. This scan showed an increase in size in the RUL
consolidation with some new fullness in the R hilum. PET-CT was
done on [**2175-9-9**], revealing intense FDG activity in the R lung
consistent with malignancy. There was also an FDG-avid area in
the proximal descending colon. The patient underwent a flex
bronch [**2175-10-19**], and the brushings and washings were negative. No
lymph nodes were biopsied. She then underwent a CT guided biopsy
of the mass which revealed NSCLC most consistent with poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma.

CXR:
[**2176-2-13**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-12**], the
postoperative changes are again seen in the right hemithorax.
This includes the mediastinal and tracheal displacement as well
as distortion of the right hilus. The left lung remains
essentially clear except for some atelectatic streaks at the
base.  There appears to be a hiatal hernia in the retrocardiac
region on the lateral projection.
[**2176-2-11**] Tiny loculated right apical pneumothorax unchanged,
small to moderate right pleural effusion probably decreasing,
pleural tubes still in place. Mild cardiomegaly stable. Hiatus
hernia noted. Left upper lung clear.
[**2176-2-9**]: In comparison with the study of [**2-8**], right chest tube
again
extends to the apex and descends inferiorly to terminate at the
level of the hemidiaphragm. The small to moderate right apical
pneumothorax is again seen, though quite subtle. Right perihilar
opacity persists, most likely representing a combination of
atelectasis and contusion in this recently postoperative
patient. Left lung remains essentially clear.

Micro:  BC x 2 no growth to date, Ucx negative, sputum rare
yeast


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 25780**] was admitted on [**2176-2-8**] for Video-assisted
thoracic surgery right
upper lobectomy, video-assisted thoracic surgery right lower
lobe superior segmentectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection
and flexible bronchoscopy.  She was extubated in the operating
room and monitored in the PACU prior transfer to the floor.
Overnight she developed respiratory distress and was
re-intubated and transferred to the SICU for respiratory
failure.  Aggressive pulmonary toilet, mucolytic nebs were
administered.

Respiratory: Respiratory failure [**2176-2-9**] re-intubated on a
vent, sedated, unable to to protect her airway and manage
secretions. Aggressive pulmonary toilet, mucolytic nebs were
administered. Followed by serial ABGs (see above).  On [**2176-2-10**]
she was extubated with oxygen saturations in the 94-98% with
occasional desaturations to low 90's on 50% shovel mask.
Aggressive chest PT was administered her oxygen saturations
improved 94-97% on 4 Liters nasal cannula.  She transferred to
the floor on [**2176-2-12**].  Oxygen saturations remained > 93%  at rest
on 3Liters of nasal cannula with desaturations to 88% with
acitivity.  She required home oxygen to maintain oxygen
saturations > 93%.

Flexible bronchoscopy was performed on [**2176-2-10**] which showed
slight effacement of right middle lobe medial segment.

[**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain: right was removed on [**2176-2-10**].  She was followed by
serial chest films which showed atelectasis and stable right
apical space.

Cardiac: she remained hemodynamically stable in sinus rhythm.

GI: prophylactis PPIs and bowel regime were administered

Nutrition: She tolerated a regular diet.

Speech: Speech and swallow consulted for a weak voice.  Vocal
cord paralysis since [**2164**] no signs of aspiration. Continue with
regular diet, thin liquids, medications whole. F/U with voice
therapy as an outpatient.

Renal: ATN with peak CRE 1.9 base 1.1-1.3.  She was hydrated
with CRE return to baseline.  On [**2176-2-12**] she was gently diuresed
with IV lasix with good Urine output.
On [**2176-2-13**] she restarted her home lasix dose.  Electrolytes were
repleted as needed.

Pain: Acute on chronic pain. history of spinal stenosis takes
home oxycodone.  She was started with a Dilaudid PCA titrated to
comfort.  Once extubated she was converted to PO oxycodone with
good pain control.

Disposition: Physical therapy recommended Short term rehab.  She
was discharged [**2176-2-14**] to [**Hospital1 **] in [**Location (un) 701**].
