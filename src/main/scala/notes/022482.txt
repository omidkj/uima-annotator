History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 15633**] is a 79 yo female with a complex medical history
including severe aortic stenosis, s/p bioprosthetic
AVR/CABG([**2118**]-F [**Doctor Last Name **]) now with bioprosthetic restenosis and
recurrent systolic heart failure requiring multiple
hospitalizations, Patient also s/p CABG x1([**2118**]) and
PCI-LAD([**2119**]). Cardiac status further complicated by mitral
regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension and complete heart block
s/p pacemaker([**2120**]),   hypertension, and insulin-dependent
diabetes. Last month, patient was admitted for severe
hypertension and
resultant pulmonary edema. She was treated with IV Lasix and a
repeat TTE showed progression of the restenosis of her
bioprosthetic valve. At that point her beta-blocker was
increased to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day, her Diovan was
decreased from 120 mg twice a day to 120 mg once a day and
diltiazem XR was started. She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for
surgical evaluation. The patient refused surgery at that time.
On [**2125-10-12**], pt saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in cardiology clinic on
[**2125-10-12**] where she reported progression of her symptoms. She was
not compliant wtih her diet, PCP had increased her diovan to
160mg daily because her BPs at home had been high. Her dose of
lasix was increased. She was subsequently admitted to CCU with
congestive heart failure placed on BiPap and Lasix gtt. Cardiac
surgery was reconsulted for surgical evaluation
Cardiac Echocardiogram: [**2125-10-16**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**12-16**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2125-10-23**]:
The left atrium is elongated. There is severe symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and
transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral
stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
partially echodense pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2125-10-22**] where
the she underwent a redo sternotomy with a Bentall procedure
with a 21 mm [**Company 1543**] Freestyle    bioprosthesis with coronary
button reimplantation, as well as redo coronary artery bypass
grafting with reverse saphenous vein graft from the [**Company 1543**]
Freestyle graft
to the existing reverse saphenous vein graft to the distal right
coronary artery.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU on Epinephrine,
Neo-Synephrine, Propofol and Dobutamine in stable condition for
recovery and invasive monitoring. She had been doing well on
[**2125-10-24**] and had her chest tube removed earlier in the day when
she suddenly had arrhythmia issues and became hypotensive.  An
echocardiogram was performed which showed tamponade.  She was
brought to the operating room emergently for mediastinal
exploration. She had multiple clots evacuated and a repair for
bleeding coming from a hole in the vein graft proximally. A
sheet of Cormatrix was used to cover the vein graft repair and 2
chest tubes were placed.  See operative note for full details.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the ICU
in stable condition.  She did go into rapid atrial fibrillation
post operatively and was bolused with Amiodarone and loaded with
a drip.  She had an attempted cardioversion postoperatively
which was unsuc
