Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This patient was transferred from an
outside hospital for cardiac catheterization, where his chief
complaint had been shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 17702**] is an 81-year-old
white male with a past medical history significant for
hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and a remote
tobacco history, who was in generally good health with no
known coronary artery disease, and presented to an outside
hospital with acute shortness of breath the night prior to
admission while sitting and watching television.  He stated
that his shortness of breath worsened with ambulation and
other activity.  He denied having any associated chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, palpitations, or diaphoresis.  He was taken
to the Emergency Department of the outside hospital, where an
EKG done showed poor R wave progression in leads V1 through
V3.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled and showed a troponin of
39.21, and a CK of 246.  At this time he was transferred to
the coronary care unit at the outside hospital, where a chest
x-ray was found to be consistent with congestive heart
failure.  The patient received a 40 mg intravenous dose of
Lasix, and responded with a 1,200 cc diuresis.  He was
started on heparin, aspirin, a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor.  The heparin was however discontinued secondary to
some mild hematuria.  He continued to remain symptom free,
and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Hypertension.  2. Gout.  3.
Hypercholesterolemia.  4. Remote history of kidney stones.
5. Benign prostatic hypertrophy with normal biopsy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Univasc 15 mg p.o. q.d.  2.
Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q.d.  3. Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Hydrochlorothiazide.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies..

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 17702**] has a 20-pack-year smoking
history, but quit smoking approximately 20 years before.  He
denies any alcohol or other illicit drug use.  He lives with
his son in [**Name (NI) 5110**] and is a retired employee of [**Company 86**]
[**Male First Name (un) 17703**] Company.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His mother and sister both passed away in
their 70s secondary to coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission Mr. [**Known lastname 17702**] was a pleasant
elderly man in no acute distress.  He was found to have a
temperature of 98.1 degrees, heart rate of 78 and sinus
rhythm, blood pressure 178/90, respiratory rate 18 and an
oxygen saturation on room air of 95%.  His pupils were
equally reactive to light and accommodation and his
extraocular movements were intact.  His neck was supple with
jugular venous distension at approximately 8 cm, 2+ palpable
carotid pulses with no bruits.  His cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2, as
well as a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  He did not have any
S3, S4 or rubs.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended
with no hepatosplenomegaly or other palpable masses.  His
extremities were warm and dry, with minimal bilateral pedal
edema.  He had 2+ palpable pedal pulses.  Neurologically he
was alert and oriented  to person, place and time, with 5/5
strength and sensation in both upper and lower extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission his complete blood count was
significant for a white blood cell count of 9.9, hematocrit
44 and a platelet count of 188.  Chem-7 showed a sodium of
136, potassium 3.9, chloride 99 and a bicarbonate of 29, BUN
and creatinine of 46 and 1.8, and a blood glucose of 154.
His prostate specific antigen at the time of admission was
18.  At the outside hospital he was found to have successive
troponins of 39.2 and 47.1 as well as a CK of 246.  His
initial PT and PTT were 12.2 and 31.8, and at the time that
his heparin was stopped due to hematuria his PTT was 91.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 17702**] was accepted as a transfer from
[**Hospital3 **], and admitted to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory.  While there, he was found to have a left
ventricular ejection fraction estimated to be 20-25%.  He was
also found to have distal 40% occlusion of his left main
coronary artery, subtotal occlusion of the left anterior
descending artery, proximal 70% focal disease as well as
distal occlusion of the left circumflex artery, and a
proximal 70% occlusion of the obtuse marginal artery.  The
patient tolerated his catheterization well, and was
subsequently transferred to the floor in stable condition.

On hospital day two, through various discussions with his
family and the cardiac surgery service, the patient decided
to proceed with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

On hospital day two the patient was restarted on heparin at
which time he redeveloped hematuria.  The urology service was
subsequently consulted to further evaluate this issue.  He
underwent flexible cystoscopy which revealed a likely
prostatic source to his gross hematuria.  The heparin drip
was restarted and a three-way Foley catheter was placed so
that he could have continuous bladder irrigation to keep his
urine clear.  Follow up was arranged with the urology service
as an outpatient in the future once his cardiac issues have
been resolved.

Mr. [**Known lastname 17702**] was taken to the operating room on [**2193-1-11**] where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 3.
Please refer to the dictated operative note for full details
of his procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well,
and was transferred in stable condition to the cardiac
surgery recovery unit.  At the time of transfer, he was found
to have a mean arterial pressure of 72, being A-paced at 80
beats per minute.  He was on a milrinone drip at 0.25 mcg per
kg per minute as well as a propofol drip at 10 mcg per kg per
minute.  Following arrival in the CSRU, the patient
subsequently required a small dose of Levophed to maintain a
mean arterial pressure in the 60s.  He also received two
units of packed red blood cells for an hematocrit of 24.6,
and was found to have a post transfusion hematocrit of 25.6.

On postoperative day one the patient was reversed, weaned
from the ventilator, and successfully extubated.  He was
weaned off of his milrinone and Levophed drips, continuing
only on an insulin drip at approximately two units per hour.
He continued at this time to have continuous bladder
irrigation through his three-way Foley catheter.

In the days following extubation, the patient did require
intermittent milrinone to maintain his cardiac index.  At
this time diuresis was also started with Lasix with excellent
response.  Levofloxacin was also started for treatment of a
urinary tract infection.

On postoperative day four, the patient was weaned off
milrinone altogether, received one unit of blood for an
hematocrit of 27%, and captopril was slowly titrated up.  At
this time, he was deemed stable and ready for transfer to the
floor.  Continuous bladder irrigation had been stopped, and
urine draining into the Foley catheter was tea colored.

On transfer to the floor, the patient initially had a large
oxygen requirement, requiring six liters of nasal cannula
oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations above 95%.  This was
slowly weaned, as he improved, and diuresis continued.  He
continued to improve as well in terms of functional mobility
in his therapy sessions with the physical therapy service.

His Foley catheter was discontinued on [**1-17**] which was
postoperative day six, and the patient was initially able to
void, though in small amounts.  By lateral that night, the
patient became uncomfortable and was subsequently unable to
void.  A three-way Foley catheter was replaced, and 800 cc of
clear yellow urine as well as one large blood clot drained
into the Foley catheter.

On postoperative day seven, it was felt that the patient was
stable and ready for discharge from a cardiopulmonary
standpoint.  It was felt at this time that he would benefit
from a short stay at an extended
