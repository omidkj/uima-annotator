Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Zocor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7299**]
Chief Complaint:
Hematuria with clots and urinary retention.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cystoscopy, clot evacuation, bladder fulguration.
2. Repeat cystoscopy.


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] M with history of [**Age over 90 **] cancer s/p XRT and brachytherapy
in [**2129**] + salvage radiation therapy presents with hematuria and
clot urinary retention.  He had been seen for the past several
months with intermittent hematuria.  He has a chronic indwelling
urinary catheter and was last seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**12-19**] where
a cystoscopy was done revealing a edematous bladder consistent
with radiation changes, but no active bleeding and no clots
within the bladder.  He has an 18Fr Coude catheter in place and
he noticed his catheter had stopped draining for 12 hours.  On
arrival to the ED his catheter had begun to drain again.  He was
hand-irrigated until urine was amber colored.  He refused to
have a larger catheter placed.  He was taught how to
hand-irrigate himself and was discharged home.  However, he was
noted to have blockage of his catheter again when he went home
so a decision was made to admit him to the Urology service and
to take him to the operating room on [**2137-12-27**] for cystoscopy,
clot evacuation,
and bladder fulgeration.

Past Medical History:
Atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation (no anticoag. [**1-29**] bleed)
Coronary artery disease s/p CABG
Systolic Heart Failure with EF of 30%
Severe TR/Pulm HTN and Moderate MR
[**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 9197**] cancer treated with XRT/brachitherapy complicated by
urethral strictures and genitourinary bleeding.
Renal artery stenosis s/p stenting
Renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of
Prior TIA.
Right pleural effusion treated with thoracentesis in [**2134**]
Chronic Interstitial Lung disease/pleural plaque
H/o GI bleed

Social History:
Patient lives alone in [**Location (un) **] and was widowed almost one year
ago. He has visting nurses and family who help with his home
care but is generally independant. He worked in [**Country 532**] as an

[**2138-1-7**]: FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.

Imaging:
[**12-27**] Renal u/s:
The right kidney measures 7 cm and is mildly echogenic. A
interpolar cyst
measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.6 cm shows no internal vascularity or
septations and is unchanged in size from [**2137-8-19**]. No
hydronephrosis is present. The left kidney measures 9 cm and is
diffusely echogenic consistent with medical renal disease. No
hydronephrosis or masses are present.  IMPRESSION: Diffusely
echogenic kidneys consistent with medical renal disease. Right
renal cyst with calcifications is unchanged in size. The right
renal upper pole lesion seen on the prior CT was difficult to
visualize on this examination.
.
[**12-28**] CXR: Comparison is made to the prior study from [**2135-8-20**].
Median sternotomy wires and cardiomegaly is again seen and
unchanged. There is a moderate right-sided pleural effusion as
well as pleural plaques along the right chest. This is stable.
There is increased prominence of the pulmonary interstitial
markings suggesting an element of fluid overload. The aorta is
tortuous. There is minimal blunting of the left CP angle
suggestive of a small effusion. There is also some increased
density at the left base which may represent an early infiltrate
versus atelectasis.
.
[**12-31**] MRI abd/pelvis: There is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
In fact,
there is paucity of fluid within the collecting systems, which
may represent reduced production of urine. There is no
perinephric fluid or fat stranding.  There are multiple
bilateral renal cysts that demonstrate slight increase in size
compared to MRI of five years ago. The largest on the left
measures 1.7 cm. The slightly septated cyst in the right upper
pole measures 13 mm, stable from previous exam. The new cystic
lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney measures 1.5 cm. On
ASL-MRI, it does not demonstrate any flow to suggest a neoplasm.
It is also noted that there is paucity of signal in the renal
parenchyma on the ASL images. Apparent reduced perfusion in the
kidney which may represent a sequela or cause of patient's
decreased renal function.  The liver is unremarkable. The
patient is status post cholecystectomy. The CBD is dilated up to
12 mm in the porta hepatis and tapers normally down to the
ampulla. Adrenals, pancreas, and spleen are unremarkable. There
is interval increase in the size of bilateral pleural effusions
from CT scan of [**2137-7-28**], with associated
atelectasis/consolidation. It is also noted that the IVC size in
the intrahepatic and infrahepatic portions is large, which may
represent fluid overload status.  MRI OF THE PELVIS: There is a
Foley catheter in a near-empty bladder. There is a small amount
of hemorrhagic fluid in the bladder lumen. The bladder wall is
significantly thickened up to 15 mm, probably related to prior
radiation treatments in conjunction with nondistention. The
T2-weighted images through the pelvis are degenerated by motion
and breathing artifact, however, a short segment of the distal
ureter, about 1.5 cm distal to the left UVJ, appears to be
significantly thickened up to 7 mm (7:20). There is no dilation
of the ureter proximal to this segment. The right distal ureter
is difficult to assess due to motion artifact. There is a small
amount of nonhemorrhagic free fluid in the pelvis. There is no
adenopathy. IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis or reversible cause for renal failure
identified.
2. No perfusion in the cystic renal mass in the right upper pole
of the
kidney. Apparent reduced perfusion in the kidney which may
represent a
sequela or cause of patient's decreased renal function. 3.
Thickened bladder and a short segment of distal left ureter
thickening without proximal obstruction. 4. New bilateral
pleural effusions, atelecta
