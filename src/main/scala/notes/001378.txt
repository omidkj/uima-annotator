Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery team and taken to the
operating room for exploratory laparotomy, abdominal washout,
[**Location (un) **] patch-omental patch repair of anterior duodenal ulcer,
and placement of drain. IV Zosyn was started. Postoperatively
she was taken to the ICU for close hemodynamic monitoring due to
postoperative hypotension where she required Neo gtt. She
received fluid resuscitation as well. Once stable the Neo was
weaned off and she was extubated and transferred to the floor
the following day.

Upon transfer to the floor she progressed as expected. Her diet
was re-introduced slowly for which she has been able to tolerate
and home medications restarted with exception of Naprosyn. Her
JP drain output has been followed very closely as well and on
day of discharge had put out approx 200 cc's in the previous 24
hours. The decision was made to keep the JP in place and to
follow up in [**Hospital 2536**] clinic in a week to assess removal. A record of
her daily outputs should accompany her to her follow up
appointment.

The IV antibiotics were stopped after she developed a macular
pruritic rash on her extremities; this improved immediately
following stopping the Zosyn.

Her fluid volume status was noted to be positive for several
liters requiring diuresis with Lasix IV based on her exam and
chest radiographs. She also required intermittent repletion of
her potassium with this diuresis. [**Male First Name (un) 14261**] for her LE edema were
applied.

She was evaluated by Physical therapy and is being recommended
for short term rehab after her acute hospital stay. She was
discharged to rehab on [**2124-10-19**] and will follow up in the [**Hospital 2536**]
Clinic in 1 week.
