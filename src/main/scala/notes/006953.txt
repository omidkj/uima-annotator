Final Report
PROCEDURE: Chest PA and lateral on [**2147-5-15**].

COMPARISON: [**2147-5-8**].

HISTORY: 67-year-old man status post CABG, evaluate for sternal
wires and
sternal drainage.

FINDINGS:

The small right pleural effusion has increased on today's
examination. A new
small to moderate left pleural effusion with associated left
lower lobe
atelectasis is new on today's examination. The patient is redo
status post
CABG with new sternotomy wires, none of which are broken or
displaced. There
is no pneumothorax. The heart size is mildly enlarged but
stable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post redo CABG with a small to moderate left pleural
effusion and
adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
3. Unremarkable sternal wires.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2147-5-5**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV cavity.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.


REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis and inferolateral
akinesis. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments
(LVEF = 35%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
