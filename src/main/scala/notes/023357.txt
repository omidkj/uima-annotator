chemotherapy with dose-reduced Dacarbazine (cycle 1 completed
[**2146-9-7**]) who presents to the ED from home with fever to 103,
feeling flushed, and worsening shortness of breath. Yesterday,
patient started second round of chemotherapy, Neupogen, unit of
blood transfusion. Then this evening developed gradually
worsening shortness of breath which started a few months ago,
likely [**2-23**] to . She denies dysuria, low back pain.

bacteria. Urine and blood culture obtained. CXR per report
negative for acute process. CTA chest negative for PE or acute
aortic syndrome, clear lungs, no pericardial effusion, multiple

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
-Noted a nonhealing ulcer on the back of her left calf over the
summer of [**2144**].
- [**9-/2144**], she noted that this ulcer was getting larger and she
was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13712**] who performed a
biopsy [**2144-10-20**], which revealed an approximately 4-mm deep,
ulcerated melanoma with a high mitotic rate.
- [**2144-11-3**], she underwent a wide local excision with pathology
again revealing an approximately 4-mm ulcerated melanoma with a
high mitotic rate; had delayed healing from the skin graft and
required many visits by VNA
- At the time of her initial visit to [**Hospital1 18**] cutaneous oncology
program on [**2145-1-20**], it was identified that she had numerous
in-transit metastases.
- PET CT [**2145-2-1**]
left iliac and bilateral inguinal FDG-avid lymphadenopathy
concerning for metastatic disease, as well as a left posterior
calf FDG-avid lesion with FDG avid local satellite lesions.
-[**2145-2-17**] FNA of an FDG-avid right inguinal node, which showed
no evidence of malignancy.
- PET CT scan [**2145-3-31**]
bilateral axillary, inguinal, and pelvic adenopathy with
low-level FDG avidity. This was somewhat more prominent compared
to her previous scan, but fairly stable in general.
- [**2145-5-6**], she underwent left leg hypothermic isolated limb
perfusion with excision of two enlarged lymph nodes that were
adjacent to the vessels. One of the two nodes contained
metastatic melanoma (performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 69344**] at
[**Hospital6 1129**]).
- [**2145-5-18**] to [**2145-5-25**], she was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2025**] for
pancytopenia, and was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics
and
observation.
- [**2145-11-24**], she underwent a completion left inguinal lymph node
dissection by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 69344**]. Pathology revealed disease in [**1-28**]
lymph
nodes removed without evidence of extracapsular extension.
- PET/CT [**2146-5-23**]
new FDG-avid (SUV 8.1) right paratracheal lymph node, new
FDG-avid lesions in anterior abdominal wall (SUV 3.9), increase
in FDG avidity of left anterior abdominal wall lesion close to
left inguinal region and left adrenal lesion. Multiple small new
lesions seen in soft tissues and vastus lateralis of left leg.
- [**2146-7-6**] started taxol 50 mg/m2 weekly for 3 out of 4 weeks,
also continued aranesp 500 mcg sc weekly
- [**2146-8-31**] taxol stopped because of POD on PET CT [**2146-8-24**] of the
infraclavicular, paratracheal, prevertebral, and left internal
iliac lymph nodes and the left anterior abdominal mass and LLE.
- Received DTIC 500 mg/m2 on [**2146-9-7**]
.

1. Psoriatic arthritis and extensive psoriatic skin plaques.
2. Malignant melanoma as above
3. Myelodysplastic syndrome - on aranesp 500 mcg weekly
4. Hypertension.
