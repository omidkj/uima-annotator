Pertinent Results:
[**2181-1-8**] - CT: Shows L SDH 26mm in its greatest width with mild
3mm
subfalcine herniation
Labs: hct 47, Plt 215, PTT 27.2, INR 1.9, Chem wnl with Cr 1.0
EKG: Atrial fibrillation, TW inversino III, no ST elevation
.
[**2181-1-10**] - Duplex: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40%
carotid stenosis.
.
[**2181-1-11**] Pathology - Blood and fibrin, consistent with hematoma.
(OR specimen)
.
[**2181-1-12**] Interval resorption of subdural hemorrhage and
pneumocephalus with increase in soft tissue swelling at
craniectomy site.
.
[**2181-1-14**] CT chest 1. Bilateral pleural effusions with parenchymal
opacities most compatible with compressive atelectasis. No
findings worrisome for pneumonia. 2. Lobulated contour of the
liver, perhaps of little clinical significance, although the
appearance may be due to hepatic congestion in the setting of
right heart failure. Consideration of ultrasound investigation
is recommended if there is concern for hepatic dysfunction. 3.
Marked pancreatic atrophy. 4. Status post sternotomy, mitral
valve repair, apparently CABG, and again with very large right
atrium. 5. Sludge and/or stones in the gallbladder, but no
gallbladder distension.
.
[**1-15**] EEG EEG Study Date of [**2181-1-15**]
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording, there was loss of
faster
frequencies over the left side. There were no associated
epileptiform
discharges.
ABNORMALITY #2: Throughout the recording, the background was
disorganized, slow, typically in the [**5-12**] Hz frequency range, and
admixed
with frequent bursts of prolonged moderate amplitude generalized
mixed
theta and delta frequency slowing.
BACKGROUND: As above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed as this was a portable
study.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed as this
was a
portable study.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were noted.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed an irregularly irregular rhythm with an
average
rate of 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to loss of
faster
frequencies over the left side, which could suggest underlying
cortical
and subcortical dysfunction but could also be related to
presence of
material interposed between the cortex and skull (e.g. subdural
hemorrhage). In addition, the background was disorganized, slow,
and
interrupted by frequent bursts of generalized mixed theta and
delta
frequency slowing consistent with a mild encephalopathy which
suggests
dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.

Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the
common
causes of encephalopathy. There were no epileptiform discharges
noted.
No electrographic seizure activity was noted.
.
[**2181-1-16**] CT Head Since [**2181-1-14**], increase in size of mixed density
left subdural hematoma, now with a maximal thickness of 2.1 cm.
No significant change in the minimal left to right shift of
normally midline structures. Reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] who
thought CT essentially stable.
.
[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT)  [**2181-1-18**] 3:36 PM
FINDINGS: No DVT was demonstrated in either the right or left
leg.
.
[**1-17**]  NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: No significant change compared to
one day prior. Again seen is a mixed density extra-axial fluid
collection extending along the left cerebral convexity measuring
up to 12 mm in greatest diameter with mass effect and sulcal
effacement on the subjacent cortex. Scattered foci of
pneumocephalus are also unchanged. The ventricles are stable in
size and configuration. There is stable mild subfalcine
herniation and 3 mm of rightward midline shift. Periventricular
hypoattenuation is consistent with chronic microvascular
ischemic disease. Bilateral basal ganglia calcification is
noted. Osseous structures are significant for a left
frontoparietal craniotomy. Left subgaleal fluid collection has
increased in size measuring up to 13 mm, previously up to 10 mm.
Bilateral scleral bands noted. NG tube is in the right nostril.

IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in left mixed density subdural
hematoma.
2. Increasing left subgaleal hematoma.
.
[**1-18**] [**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL FINDINGS: No DVT was demonstrated in
either the right or left leg.
.
[**2181-1-21**] Portable CXR: Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Bilateral
pleural effusions moderate in size, greater on the right side,
are grossly unchanged allowing the difference in position of the
patient. Bibasilar atelectasis are present. NG tube tip is in
the stomach. There is no pneumothorax. Patient is post median
sternotomy. There has been improvement with almost complete
resolution of mild CHF.
.
[**2181-1-22**] NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is slightly larger mixed
density extra-axial fluid collection extending along the left
cerebral convexity measuring up to 2.4 cm in greatest diameter
with mass effect and sulcal effacement on the subadjacent
cortex. Scattered foci of pneumocephalus are unchanged since
[**2181-1-17**]. There is a stable mild subfalcine herniation of 4 mm
and slight rightward midline shift. Periventricular
hypoattenuation consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic
disease is unchanged since [**2181-1-17**]. Bilateral basal ganglia
calcification is unchanged since [**2181-1-17**]. A left frontoparietal
craniotomy is unchanged since [**2181-1-17**]. The left subgaleal fluid
collection measures 12 mm, previously 13 mm, grossly unchanged.
