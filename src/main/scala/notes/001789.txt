History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14921**] is a Spanish-speaking only [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman
who presents today for evaluation of abdominal pain, nausea, and
vomiting. He reportedly experienced acute onset of mid-abdominal
pain around noon today. He had an associated episode of
non-bilious, non-bloody emesis. His abdomen has been distended
the past few days and he has been constipated (no bowel movement
in the last 5 days). He continues to pass small amounts of gas.
His PMH from OMR shows that he has had prior episodes of
diverticulitis but his daughter today denied previous episodes.

He was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 14922**] for a streptococcal
pneumonia complicated by respiratory distress requiring
intubation.

Brief Hospital Course:
GI/GU: The patient presented with abdominal pain and a CT
Abd/Pelvis showed diffuse wall thickening of the proximal to mid
sigmoid colon with associated surrounding fat stranding, most
consistent with colitis. Due to his deteriorating status in the
ED thought to be secondary to sepsis from this acute abdominal
process, he was taken emergently to the OR for exploratory
laparotomy. In the OR, he was found to have an enlarged,
necrotic but not yet perforated loop
of sigmoid colon with the rest of the colon deeply congested and
compromised. A total abdominal colectomy, [**Doctor Last Name **] ileostomy, and
splenorrhapy was performed. The skin was closed with surgical
staples and an ileostomy appliance applied; EBL was 350 mL and
the patient was returned to the TSICU in critical condition.

CV: After total abdominal colectomy, the patient developed
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was
initially rate controlled with a diltiazem drip. He had
intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation and hypotension.
Once a TEE established the absence of thrombus, the patient was
cardioverted with amiodarone but continued to have intermittent
return to atrial fibrillation. His cardiac enzymes were
elevated, which was attributed to cardiac enzyme leak from the
stress of surgery, hypotension, and tachycardia vs. a small
perioperative MI. He was started on aspirin, but catheterization
was not a possibility at the time given inability to
anticoagulate.

Resp: The patient developed hypoxia and increased work of
breathing in the ED requiring intubation. His respiratory
distress was thought to be due to sepsis from an acute
intraabdominal process, and the patient was taken to the OR for
an exploratory laparatomy, which resulted in a total abdominal
colectomy, [**Doctor Last Name **] ileostomy and splenorrhapy. The patient
remained intubated after surgery. He was extubuated, but had to
be reintubated 2 days later for worsening respiratory status.
CXR and bronchoalveolar lavage revealed MRSA pneumonia. He was
treated with vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin. After
several days of antibiotic therapy without much clinical
improvement, the family approached the team with the wish to
change Mr. [**Known lastname 14924**] status to comfort measures only and to
extubate him. The extended family was present in discussions
with the attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] after extensive conversation
about options for care, elected for extubation and comfort
measures. The patient was extubated and expired shortly
thereafter from respiratory failure.

Neuro: The patient's was sedated for intubation. His mental
status deteriorated with his clinical status.

Renal: The patient was thought to have acute on chronic renal
insufficiency. His Cr trended down to 1.8 from a baseline of 2.2
over his hospital course. His urine output was monited with a
foley and his electrolytes repleted.

Heme: Following surgery patient's hematocrit trended down, he
was transfused 1U PRBC during his hospital course.

ID: CXR and bronchoalveolar lavage revealed MRSA pneumonia. He
was treated with vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin.
