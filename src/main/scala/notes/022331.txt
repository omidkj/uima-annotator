Brief Hospital Course:

significant mass affect, midline shift, subfalcine herniation.
He was taken to the operating room and underwent a right sided
craniotomy without complication.  Post-operatively he was awake,
alert and orientated X3 and moving all extremeties.  A repeat
head CT showed decrease subdural hematoma size with reduction in
mass effect. He was placed on 100% O2 to decrease a collection
of frontal air.

On Post-op day 2 he remained neurologically intact and was
transferred to the neurostep down unit.  He had a CXR on post-op
day 2 and 3 which showed worsening CHF he was given doses of IV
ethacrynic acid (due to allergy of Lasix) with good results, his
renal function remained stable but with a slightly high
creatinine, which according to his daughter is being followed by
his primary care physcian.

He was seen by physcial therapy and felt to be a candidate for
acute rehab.
