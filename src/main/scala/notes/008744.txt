History of Present Illness:
82yo female with past medical history of asthma was admitted
from an OSH with hypotension, altered mental status, and likely
metastatic brain lesions. History obtained primarily from OSH
records, notes, and ED records.

On the day prior to admission, patient reported the sudden onset
of a severe headache for which she took approximately 7 advil
tablets. Shortly afterwards, she reportedly developed increasing
lethargy, vomiting, weakness, and subsequently became
unresponsive. EMS was called and took patient to [**Hospital1 10551**].

Upon arrival at [**Hospital3 **] at 1:45pm on [**2154-9-27**], BP 91/34,
HR 85, RR 18, and O2 sat 97% on 100% nonrebreather. Patient was
noted to be unresponsive and was intubated. She received
lidocaine 100mg IV x 1, pancuronium 1mg IV x 1, etomidate 20mg
IV x 1, and succinylcholine 100mg IV x 1. Shortly after
intubation she was noted to be hypotensive with SBP in the 50s
and she was started on dopamine gtt with improvement in SBPs to
70-80s. Initial head CT at [**Hospital3 **] noted a hyperdense
lesion in the right posterior temporal lobe with suggested
intraparenchymal hemorrhage versus metastatic lesion.  She was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation of
possible intraparenchymal bleed.  Additional medications
received at [**Hospital3 **] include zofran 4mg x 1 and
fosphenytoin loading dose.

Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], radiology reviewed her imaging and found
her images most consistent with a metastatic lesion, concerning
for a primary adenocarcinoma. Clinically patient remained
unresponsive despite having not received any sedation in the
last 6-8 hours prior to arrival. Neurosurgery evaluated patient
and found her exam concerning for unresponsiveness and
posturing, although with no other acute surgical issues.
Neurology also evaluated patient and will be following closely.
While in the ED, she received Ceftriaxone 1gram IV, vancomycin
1gram IV, and 4L NS with 1600mL UOP.

Regarding likely metastatic lesion, unclear that patient has
ever had age-appropriate cancer screening, including mammogram
or colonoscopy.

Pertinent Results:
[**2154-9-27**] Blood Cx pending x 2
[**2154-9-28**] Urine Cx pending

OSH STUDIES:
- CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis - [**2154-9-27**] - no abnormality identified
within the chest, abdomen, or pelvis to account for loss of
consciousness; mild dependent atelectasis within the lung;
abdominal examination is normal.
- CT Head - [**2154-9-27**] - 11mm round hyperdense focus centered at
the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction of the posterior right temporal lobe,
seen in association with vasogenic edema. ? hemorrhagic
metastasis or focal parenchymal bleed.

[**Hospital1 18**] STUDIES:
- ECG [**2154-9-27**] - NSR at 85 bpm with no ST changes
- Head CT - [**2154-9-27**] - 1.  1.1-cm hyperdense lesion with
surrounding edema seen in the right temporal lobe, suggestive of
metastatic lesion.  2.  Linear hyperattenuation seen at the
posterior right lateral ventricle, possibly representing venous
filling, however, assessment for hemorrhage is limited by
intravenous contrast.
- Head MRI - [**2154-9-28**] - final read pending
- CXR - [**2154-9-28**] - final read pending


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 82 yo F with asthma admitted with hypotension
and altered mental status found to have profound metabolic
acidosis (lactate 7).  She was also found to have a brain
lesion, with possible hemorragic component based on imaging at
the OSH. She was treated aggressively with a bicarbonate drip to
correct her acidosis.  Her lactate trended down and her gap
closed.  Initially she was intubated and on pressors for
hypotension.  She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics
(ceftriaxone/vancomycin) because of concern for sepsis.
Cultures were all negative.  It was thought that the patient may
have had a seizure from the brain lesion.  The patient was
quickly extubated and maintained her pressures off pressors.
She was started on keppra [**Hospital1 **].  The neurosurgeons evaluated the
lesion and felt that a brain biopsy of the lesion would be
necessary for diagnosis.  The patient and her family the decided
on DNR/DNI/CMO.  Arrangements were made for the family to be
discharged home with hospice care and plans for the patient to
fly to [**Country 38213**] (her home) in the near future.
