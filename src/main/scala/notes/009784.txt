Pertinent Results:
[**2156-1-19**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel CAD. The LMCA was patent.  The LAD was
totally
occluded proximally without collateral filling.  The LCx was
retroflexed
and gave off a high OM1 (functionally a ramus) that had a hazy
60%
lesion proximally (OM2, on a curve). The RCA was a large
dominant vessel
diffusely calcified with 80% proximally.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed initial normal systemic

arterial pressures with an SBP of 100 mmHg.  Over the course of
the
case, systemic arterial systolic pressures declined to SBPs in
the
70s-80s requiring initiation of dopamine gtt and levophed gtt.
3. Initially successful PTCA alone of totally occluded proximal
LAD with
ultimate shutdown of LAD. Unsuccessful rescue of LAD.
4. Successful IABP.

CTA [**2156-1-20**]:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection.
2. Aortobiliac stent is in place, which appears intact. There is
no evidence of an endoleak. Excluded aneurysmal sac is slightly
decreased in size from [**2153-8-22**] exam.
3. Multiple focal hypodensities, too small to characterize, most
likely cysts or hamartomas.
4. An hypodense lesion centered within the uncinate process of
the pancreas, stable in size and appearance from [**2153-8-22**] exam,
which likely represents an IPMN or alternatively, serous
cystadenoma.

ECHO [**2156-1-19**]
Pre-CPB:
The patient is on IABP at 1:1, on dopamine and levophed.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with intact basal motion but hypokinesis of the mid-anterior and
antero-septal walls. The apex is akinetic.
There is mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
An IABP is seen in the descendiing aorta 9 cm. beyond the arch.
Surgeons advised to move it more proximally.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2470**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2156-1-19**] for further
management of her chest pain. A cardiac catheterization was
performed showing a totally occluded left anterior descending
artery which was incompletely opened with angioplasty. There was
significant concomittant disease and emergent surgical
revascularization was undertaken after an intra aortic balloon
was placed for stabilization.

In the Operating Room the LV was very impaired with an ejection
fraction of 20-25%. She left the operating room on Epinephrine,
levophed, and Neo Synephrine.  She was very unstable and bleed
profusely having received Integrilin preoperatively. There was a
large apical hematoma on the left lung and echocardiographic
evidence of a mediastinal hematoma. She was returned to the
operating room on [**2156-1-20**] for a reexploration for bleeding.
Hemostasis was acheived and vasopressin was added with improved
hemodynamics. Multiple blood products were administered and
coagulation parameters gradually corrected. Pressors were weaned
significantly, however, they were required for another week and
a half. She required a right chest tube for a pneumothroax.

The balloon was removed on POD 3 without incident and aggressive
diuresis undertaken. She was neurologically intact and extubated
on POD 10, all pressors were off at that point.

On POD 14 she transferred to the floor and Coreg was given due
to her severe LV dysfunction. Gentle diuresis was continued and
she was screened for rehabilitation. She worked with physical
therapy daily. She developed atrial fibrillation which was
treated with amiodarone. She converted back into a normal sinus
rhythm. She developed some drainage from the lower pole of her
sternotomy. Ancef was started intravenously which was switched
to keflex on discharge. She continued to make steady progress
and was discharged home on [**2156-2-4**]. She will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will refer her
to a cardiologist. An ace inhibitor should be started at some
point given her diminished ejection fraction and preoperative
myocardial infarction. She did not have adequate room with her
blood pressure (90's/50-60's) to add an ace and thus it will
need to be addressed as an outpatient.
