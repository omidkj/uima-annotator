History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 yo Chinese male with history of HTN and chest pain

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral
Doppler and TVI c/w Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. No
resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Calcified tips of papillary
muscles. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I
(mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Aortic valve sclerosis without stenosis. Mild aortic and mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 80 yo chinese male with history of history of HTN
and chest pain on exertion for the last 3-4 years who came in to
stress test on [**2167-7-9**] which showed Complex three vessel
coronary artery disease and patient was worked up for CABG.

# CAD: The cardiac cath  revealed three vessel disease. The LAD
had a 60% proximal lesion and a 80% stenosis in a major,
bifurcation diagonal branch. The LCx had multiple stenosis with
90% proximal lesion and complex 95% mid to distal lesion with
the distal vessel filling via right to left collaterals. The RCA
had a 50% proximal
stenosis, 90% mid stenosis, 60% distal stenosis, and severe
diffuse
disease in the PDA. No interventions were done at the time.  He
was evaluated by cardio-thoracic surgery and was in the cardiac
services waiting for Plavix washout. He received one dose of
Plavix on [**7-9**] in the afternoon.

-Echo was done on [**7-10**] showed : Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Aortic valve sclerosis without stenosis. Mild
aortic and mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension

-Carotid US was done [**7-10**]: Duplex evaluation was performed of
bilateral carotid arteries. On the right there is moderate
calcified heterogenous plaque seen . On the left there is mild
complex plaque seen. Right ICA stenosis <40% and Left ICA
stenosis <40%.
