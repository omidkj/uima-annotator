Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BAL

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9381**] is a 77 y/o man with PMH notable for NSCLC (diagnosed
[**2145**]) s/p cyberknife radiation therapy, interstitial lung
disease, and COPD who presents with worsening respiratory
distress. He notes worsening difficulty with breathing for the
past four days. Denies fever but endorses chills last night.
Denies increased sputum production but endorses small amount of
blood-tinged sputum for past four days. Increased cough,
especially in the evenings with laying down.
.
In the ED, initial vitals T 102.8 rectally, HR 130, BP 125/59, R
, 51% on home 2L NC. Oxygen saturations improved to 100% on NRB,
and pulse improved to 90s-100s. Blood cultures were sent X 2.
The patient was treated with ceftriaxone 1 g IV, vancomycin 1 g
IV, and levofloxacin 750 mg IV. He was also treated with
dexamethasone 10 mg IV given his chronic steroid use and tylenol
1 g PO for fever. He received 3 L NS. From the ED, the patient
was taken to the bronchoscopy suite for bronchoscopy and BAL.
Bronchoscopy demonstrated blood in the left airways, which only
partially cleared with irrigation. BAL was performed with
results pending.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient reports less work of
breathing compared to earlier today. He denies any chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. He endorses travel to
[**State 108**] last winter but no other travel, including to [**Location (un) **].
Works on his boat occasionally where there are seagulls.
.
ROS: Endorses chills last night. No fevers/sweats. Denies sore
throat, nasal congestion, headache. No orthopnea or PND. No
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation. No burning with
urination or change in urine color. No blood in urine. No lower
leg edema.

CXR:  The wedge-shaped triangular parenchymal opacity in the
right mid zone has further decreased in size. There is interval
increase in the interstitial markings seen throughout the left
mid and lower zones, more pronounced since the prior
examination. The appearances in the left lung may represent
infectious etiology vs. a less likely possibility of a rapid
progression of interstitial lung disease. A CT chest would be
helpful for further evaluation.
.
EKG: sinus rhythm at 90, normal axis, inverted T wave in V1
(old), T wave flattening V2, upsloping T wave in V2-5 (old)
.
Chest CT ([**8-30**]): Since [**2147-5-6**] and [**2147-7-4**] diffuse
ground-glass opacity and intralobular reticulations throughout
the left lung and right upper lobe is new; the profusion is much
less in the right lower lobe with relative sparing of subpleural
parenchyma. Longstanding fibrotic interstitial lung disease,
mostly on the right and mostly in right lower lobe is otherwise
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: 1. New diffuse ground-glass opacity with
intralobular reticulation in the left lung and right upper lobe,
less in the right lower lobe could be due to [**Year (4 digits) **], diffuse
infection, or acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease.
If the prior interstitial lung disease was due to asbestos, this
is
not the expected course of that disease. Acute exacerbation of
UIP, NSIP, or AIP would be more likely.  2. Right perihilar
radiation fibrosis 3. Prior granulomatous exposure.

Chest CT [**2147-9-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Improvement of left lung ground-glass and reticulation, not
yet back
to baseline of [**2147-7-4**].
2. Improving enlarged 15-mm prevascular lymph node, decreased
from 24 mm.
3. Otherwise unchanged in 6-day interval.

PICC line [**2147-9-4**]: FINDINGS:
There is a left PICC with tip in the upper superior vena cava.



Brief Hospital Course:
77 y/o man with known interstitial lung disease and prior NSCLC
s/p radiation therapy admitted with respiratory distress and
hypoxia.
.
# Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial
lung disease with baseline oxygen requirement though clearly he
is much worse than baseline. Differential initially included
infection (bacterial, including PCP or [**Name9 (PRE) 10540**], viral, or fungal);
congestive heart failure; vasculitis (pulmonary-renal syndromes
such as Wegener's or Goodpasture's versus pulmonary syndromes
such as lupus or Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**]). Other considerations included
BOOP/COP, acute eosinophilic pneumonia and hypersensitivity
pneumonitis. Less likely was an acute worsening of underlying
lung disease as that would be atypical for UIP.

Elevated LDH in setting of chronic steroid use without PCP
prophylaxis was certainly concerning for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] visible
on BAL was concerning for diffuse alveolar damage. Cell
counts/diff, cytology, and cultures from BAL were unremarkable.
High resolution chest CT scan demonstrated new, diffuse
ground-glass opacity with intralobular reticulation in the left
lung and right upper lobe, less in the right lower lobe. These
findings were thought to be due to [**Name10 (NameIs) **], diffuse
infection, or acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease.
Acute exacerbation of UIP, NSIP, or AIP remained in the
differential. [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, legionella urinary antigen, BAL for AFB
and PCP DFA were negative, negative beta-glucan and
galactomanan. Complement levels were within normal limits. CBC
differential failed to demonstrate a peripheral eosinophilia.

Upon presentation to the MICU, the patient was begun on HCAP
treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. Vanc was
stopped on [**9-1**]. Levofloxacin and cefepime were continued with
plan for 8-day course of treatment (day 1=[**8-30**]). He was covered
for PCP with treatment dose bactrim and 1mg/kg IV steroids.
Bactrim changed to prophylaxis dose on [**9-5**] based on negative
beta-glucan/galactomannan and smere.  From [**Date range (1) 19502**], he was
given 3 days of 1g/day solumedrol. He was kept on a face mask
with goal saturations >88-90%.  He continued to desat to the low
80s with minimal movement. Upon transfer to the floor his oxygen
requirements were increased from his basline.  He is [**Age over 90 **]% on
3Liter via nasal cannula, desat to 78% on 3L with activity on 6L
his sats 91%. Physical therapy recommended inpatient pulmonary
rehab.

# Urinary retention: On arrival to the MICU, the patient had
