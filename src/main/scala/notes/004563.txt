Findings  TEE [**2199-6-27**]
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2198-2-6**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic
function. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild
AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Calcified tips of papillary
muscles. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Based on [**2190**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis
recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk
(prophylaxis recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need
for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
echocardiographic data.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2198-2-6**], the
severeity of mitral regurgitation has decreased (the blood
pressure is also lower on the current study).



Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2199-6-20**] after two day history of
fevers/chills and chest pain suggestive of reflux. He was taken
to the OR for incomplete excision of R AV loop graft. On the day
of admission the pt. went into afib with SBP initially of 130s
that dropped to 110s in the ER so the pt. was taken to an ICU
bed, cultures were sent, antibiotics (vanco/levo/flagyl) were
started, and a central line placed.  Later that evening pt. HR
continued to icrease to 190-200s with SBP that was in the
60-70s.

[**6-21**] HD2 Pt. was on neo drip at 1.5 mcg/kg/min.  also pt.s
temperature was down and blood pressures ranged from
95-137/41-48 and overall the pt. was clinically improving.  Pt.
also evaluated by cardiology today b/c of afib ->rec to start
digoxin and getting an echo.

[**6-22**] HD3 pt. remained febrile overnight w/heart rate in 100s and
BP 99/42.  PT. was successfully cardioverted with intermittent
PACs/afib tachy.  weaned off neo.  Seen by renal ->got HD today
and underwent placement of quinten for access

[**6-23**] hd4 Pt. desated, continued to require pressors to keep BP
up, Tmax of 100.4.  PT. HD again today.

[**6-24**] hd5 pt. afebrile, neo d/ced, still on dilt drip, transfused
1u prbcs, pt. prepped for OR.

[**6-25**] hd6 pt. VQ scan negative, echo showed EF 60%.  Pt.
afebrile, BPs fro 126-174/44-61.  Pt weaned off of dilt.  Pt.
went to OR today -> tolerated the completion graft excision and
placement of R temporary IJ dialysis catheter.  Pt. did well
overnight.

Rest of pt.s hospital stay was uneventful.  Pt. remained
afebrile, BPs ranged from 140-177/70-84 with HR in 70's and
medication at home were resumed (lopressor 200bid, losartan 50
qd and nifedipine ER 120 qd. He was tolerating POs. Pt underwent
TEE [**2199-6-27**] that demonstrated no vegetations.

He was closely followed by nephrology ( on HD at [**Location (un) 4265**] in
[**Location (un) **]; Dr [**First Name (STitle) 805**] is nephrologist) during this stay.
Outpatient dialysis arrangement were made with set up for
vancomycin dosing at hemodialysis per level for positive blood
cultures and graft on [**6-20**] for staph aureus coag positive for a
total of 6 weeks. Subsequent blood cultures on [**6-24**] are still
pending. Rectal screen for VRE and MRSA was negative.

Upon dischare the right forearm old graft site was slightly pink
with sutures and no drainage. A VNA referral was made to change
a dry sterile dressing then ace qd. He was scheduled to follow
up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 1 week post discharge. Labs on d/c were
wbc 10.2, hct 29.6, plt 236, sodium 135, chloride 98, bicarb 25,
bun 56 and creatinine 8.7. A vanco level was pending. He was
given script for ostomy supplies.
