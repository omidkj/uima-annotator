History of Present Illness:
80 year old male with hx of prior CABG, MI, ischemic CM with an
EF of 35% who was admitted last month to [**Hospital3 **] with CHF and
new afib. He was rate controlled and had a stress test that
showed anterior reversibility and a fixed inferior defect. Cath
was recommended but pt refused at that time. He was started on
coumadin. He notes worsening DOE over the past 6 months or so
but has difficulty giving a clear timeline to his symptom
progression. He used to be very active, now leads a more
sedentary lifestyle. At home, he denies significant improvement
in his symptoms. He was able to go back to work ~2h per week
(works as CPA) for the last week of [**Month (only) 1096**]. He sleeps on 1
pillow and denies PND. No f/c/s, no cough, no lightheadedness or
dizziness. He presented to his outpatient cardiologist on [**2170-11-22**]
and was readmitted again to [**Hospital3 **] for CHF. He was reportedly
ruled out with negative CE. BNP was 356. CXR was clear. He was
diuresed with IV lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Weight dropped 192--> 187 lbs.
He was also loaded with 600mg plavix yesterday. INR on arrival
to [**Hospital3 **] on [**11-22**] was 6.8 (up to 8.4 on [**11-23**])and Coumadin put on
hold and received 3 doses of SQ Vit K. He has remained chest
pain free. He is being referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath as
well as EP consult for possible cardioversion and ?ICD.


Past Medical History:

in the early [**2152**]'s, CABG x 3 [**2153**] at [**Location (un) **] Hospital with
vg to lad, vg to OM and vg to ramus. Cath done here [**4-25**] due to
NSTEMI showed occluded vg to rca and occluded vg to OM. s/p POBA
to native ramus.
2) Systolic CHF, acute on chronic
3) Atrial fibrillation - newly dx in [**10-27**], on coumadin
2) hypertension
3) DM type II
4) Hyperlipidemia
5) BPH s/p TURP
6) benign tumor removed from left side of the neck,
7) s/p bilateral inguinal hernia repair
8) h/o basal cell CA s/p rsx

STUDIES:
.
[**2170-11-26**] Cardiac cath:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had an
ostial
40% stenosis. The LAD was occluded proximally. The LCx was
occluded
proximally. The Ramus was patent. The RCA was known to be
occluded.
2. Arterial conduit angiography revealed that the LIMA-LAD was
widely
patent. The SVG-OM was also widely patent.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed borderline left and right sided
filling
pressures with mean PCW of 15 mmHg and RVEDP of 10 mmHg. There
was mild
pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 36 mmHg.
There was
systemic arterial systolic and diastolic hypotension with SBP of
90 mmHg
and DBP of 51 mmHg.
4. Left ventriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease (occluded native
coronaries
except patent ramus intermedius)
2. Widely patent SVG-OM and LIMA to LAD.
3. Mildly elevated right heart pressures.
.
[**2170-11-27**] CXR (PA and lateral): Small bilateral effusions. Chronic
congestion with basilar opacification thus pneumonia cannot be
excluded.
.
[**2170-11-27**] TEE:  No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. A stretched patent
foramen ovale is present with left to right shunting at rest.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. LV
systolic function appears depressed. There is septal and
anterior hypokinesis (the apex is not well visualized). There
are diffuse simple and complex (>4mm) nonmobile atheroma in the
aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
IMPRESSION: No thrombus identified. Stretched PFO. Extensive
plaque in aorta. Depressed LV systolic function.
.
[**2170-11-29**] Scrotal ultrasound: 1. No evidence of
epididymitis/orchitis.
2. Bilateral small hydroceles.
.
[**2170-11-30**] Colonoscopy:
1. A single flat sessile polyp of benign appearance was found in
the ascending colon.The polyp was about 1.5cm wide and had a
villous like appearance.The polyp site was injected with [**Country 11150**]
ink.Polypectomy was not done due to recent anticoagulation. Cold
forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the polyp in
ascending colon.
2. A frond-like/villous 3.5 cm mass of malignant appearance was
found at the cecum near ileocecal valve. The mass was friable
with superficial ulceration. Cold forceps biopsies were
performed for histology at the mass in cecum.
3. Multiple diverticula were seen in the descending colon and
sigmoid colon.Diverticulosis appeared to be of moderate
severity.
