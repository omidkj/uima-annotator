pleural drain


History of Present Illness:
This is a 45 year old male with no past medical history
presenting with 3 - 4 weeks of cough.  His symptoms began about
a month ago when he noted the onset of a dry, paroxysmal, cough
initially associated with one brief post-tussive syncope.  No
hemoptysis or sputum production.  He also states he feels short
of breath and "can't quite fill up his lungs with air."  Deep
breaths tend to set off cough paroxysms.  He has never
experienced symptoms like these in the past, and denies prior
history of asthma, allergies, or any other lung diseases.  No
history of gastroesophageal reflux.  Associated with cough and
shortness of breath, he notes non-drenching night sweats and a
[**11-9**] lb weight loss.  About 5 days prior to admission, he noted
his shortness of breath got appreciably worse: while walking in
his garden he noted significantly dyspnea. Previously he has had
normal exercise tolerance, able to play tennis, significant
exercise. He saw his primary care doctor for these complaints on
[**6-30**], who noted his heart rate to be in the 130s.  His PCP sent
him to the ED at [**Hospital1 **] for these complaints; he had a CXR
there which showed left pleural effusion and widening of his
mediastinum.  CTA showed no PE, but large pericardial effusion,
left pleural effusion, and mediastinal adenopathy.  Vitals at
this time were remarkable for HR in the 130s and Tmax of 101.5.
He had a bedside US done at [**Hospital1 **] which showed mild RV
collapse at diastole but no hypotension was noted.  Pulsus
unknown.  At time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], his vitals were 113
114.89 20 100% on 2L NC.  At [**Hospital1 18**], his vitals were 96.3 103
127/77 20 97.  Repeat bedside echo showed no echocardiographic
evidence of tamponade physiology.  There was no evidence of RV
diastolic collapse.
.
ROS:  Positive for non-drenching night sweats, recent weight
loss of [**11-9**] lbs, with no unusual bleeding/bruising, chest
pain, palpitations, PND, orthopnea.

 No exposure to pets at home.  No unusual work exposures; works

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 45 year old male with no significant past medical
history presenting with 3 weeks of dry cough, tachycardia, and
subjective dyspnea who was found to have cardiac tamponade and
primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma.
.
# Pericardial/pleural effusion - Developed in the setting of 3
weeks of indolent symptoms of cough, non-drenching night sweats,
fevers. He was found on lymph node biopsy to have a primary b
cell lymphoma.   Tamponade was noted and patient had drain
placed in the ICU with subsequent removal once tamponade
physiology resolved. Pt was found to have propionum bacterium
acnes infection of pericardial fluid as well as staph
epidermidis and was started on vancomycin while sensitvities
were being awaited from [**Hospital3 **]. Echo prior to discharge
showed resolution of pericardial fluid. he also had large
pleural effusions which were successfully drained with chest
tube removed prior to discharge. It is recommended that a repeat
Echo is conducted within 1 month of discharge.   Patient will
follow up with oncology and I.D as outpatient. Depending on the
p.acnes sensitivities he may be switched by I.D to penicillin
and ceftriaxone. Labs as recommended by I.D will be followed
whilst on antibiotics.
.
Hypodense Liver lesions.He also had hypodense liver lesions that
had been noted on abdominal CT.Liver MRI was limited, and liver
lesions could not be assessed. Repeat imaging may be considered
as an outpatient.
.
# Tachycardia - Likely in setting of underlying effusion,
resulting in reduction in cardiac output with compensatory
tachycardia.  Patient also has increased insensible water loss
due to night sweats. Patient was given several liters of fluid
this admission. Should continue to drink large amounts of fluid
as outpatient.
.
# Cough - Likely secondary to underlying effusion as noted
above. Patient was managed symptomatically with cough
supressants.
.
# Lymphadenopathy: CT shows extensive mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. Patient also had lymph node in his neck and had
excisional biopsy while in the hospital which showed primary
mediastinal B cell lymphoma.
