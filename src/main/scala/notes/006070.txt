Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
47yo male with asthma, dCHF, complex sleep disorder/OSA,
hypoventilation syndrome requiring 3-4L at baseline presenting
with increase work of breathing and SOB.
.
Patient recently hospitalized on [**10-20**] - [**10-21**] for similar
complaints of SOB. At that time patient was placed on home BiPAP
with improvement in symptoms. During that hospitalization
discussion re placement of a tracheostomy tube as a means of a
more effective therapy for his severe hypoventilation and
obstructive sleep apnea, however, entertained and patient
declined.  Upon [**Month/Year (2) **], his goal oxygen saturation was listed
as greater than 80% on oxygen supplementation with stipulation
to consider re-hospitalization only if oxygen saturations fall
below 80% or if patient symptomatic.
.
Per patient had been stable in the days following [**Month/Year (2) **] when
once again developed worsening SOB.
Pertinent +/-:
Denies associated CP, pleuritic pain, fevers, productive cough,
peipheral edema, orthopnea. Reports compliance with BiPAP
nightly.
.
Shortness of breath prompted presentation to ED. In the ED, 97.4
90 130/86 24 92% 15L and initially triggered for desats to 85%
on RA with sats improving on high flow as well as
non-rebreather. CXR with possible LLL PNA so given vanc
1gm/levoquin 750mg, combivent nebs x2. Labs notable for WBC
7.29, creatinine 1.4 (up from 0.9 on [**10-21**]), BNP ~1500, ABG
7.29/81/103. Patient received 500cc of NS. Due to concern that
patient may benefit from BiPAP decision made to transfer patient
to the MICU.
Prior to MICU transfer, VS: Afebrile, 93% on BiPAP FiO2 60
114-55 82 with appropriate mentation.
.
On the floor, patient oriented x3 with sats 88-92 on CPAP.
Reports improved breathing though not back to baseline.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI; reports increase in baseline cough in recent days
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or
weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation,
abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria,

Brief Hospital Course:
47yo male with asthma, dCHF, complex sleep disorder, OSA,
hypoventilation syndrome requiring 3-4L daily and BiPAP nightly
presenting with increase work of breathing and SOB.

1. HYPERCAPNEIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Patient with repeat
admissions for hypercapnic respiratory failure most likely due
to his obesity hypoventilation syndrome and complex sleep
disorder.  Additional work-up notable for negative Ddimer and
BNP elevated but roughly at baseline. The pt's metolazole was
held, he was given 1L IVF, started on home BiPAP settings.
Serial ABGs were checked showing stable oxygenation with
[**Month/Day/Year 103306**] with C02 to ~100.  He maintained goal sats ~88-92,
and he had clear mental status, able to interact, A&Ox3.
Standing nebs for bronchodilation. Additional Abx were held
given low clinical suspicion for PNA.  He developed severe
somnolence overnight with minimal responsiveness to sternal rub
accompanied by hypotension to the 70s-80s sytolic.  ABG again
was reassuring at that time at pO269* pCO2102 pH7.30  Bicarb 52.
 He awoke a few minutes later without residual AMS, and
normalization of his BP.  His underlying obesity hypoventilation
seems likely.  We stopped metolazone due to fears that a
mounting alkalosis was driving [**Month/Day/Year 103306**] and triggering his
respiratory failure.  Otherwise, his home BiPAP levels were
maintained.   Tracheostomy discussions were again initiated for
proper ventilation particualrly during nighttime hours, though
patient remains disinterested currently.  Followup with his
pulmonologist/sleep doctor Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 95746**] at [**Hospital1 18**] is important
to continue these discussions as well as managing his BiPAP.

2. [**Last Name (un) **]. Creatinine 1.4, up from 0.9 on previous d/c. Additional
labs c/w hemoconcentration making pre-renal azotemia most likely
cause to acute bump. Patient received 500cc of IVF in ED and
another 500cc in the MICU. He maintained good UOP and cr later
normalized to 0.9.

3. Atrial Dysarrhytmia with h/o afib/aflutter. Seen by
cardiology at last admission for eval of prolonged QTc. At that
time rec re arrhythmias was daily anticoagulation with ASA
325mg. Underlying cause that to be worsening pulm function.

4. dCHF. No signs of decompensation per HPI, labs or imaging.
BNP ~1500 within recent baseline. His diuretics were briefly
held due to concern for hypovolemia.  Lasix restarted, but held
metolazone for fear of exacerbating [**Last Name (un) 103306**].

5. Schizophrenia: continued home medications

PENDING TESTS AT [**Last Name (un) 894**]:
-blood cultures 10/7 x 2 not finalized but NGTD

TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES:
-stopped metolazone to prevent further [**Last Name (LF) 103306**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need
volume monitoring and management of diuretics
-will need sleep/pulmonology followup at [**Hospital1 18**]
-ongoing tracheostomy discussions due to worsening complex sleep
disorder/obesity-hypo
