Chief Complaint:
s/p ERCP with acute mental status changes/aspiration PNA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with sphincteroplasty
PEG tube placement (via Interventional Radiology)


History of Present Illness:
77 y/o F with PMhx of Developmental Delay, COPD, HL, HTN and
Mirizzi syndrome who presented today for elective ERCP.  Pt was
felt to be functionning at baseline prior to procedure with mild
agitation, pulling at PIVs but interacting with staff.  She was
given fent/midaz for ERCP with stent placement and was
transferred to the post-ERCP suite in stable condition. She had
elevated BPs during the procedure requiring labetalol and
metoprolol. She was found mildly tachypneic/wheezing with emesis
on her gown. It was felt likely that she had an aspiration event
with low grade temp  However, she was still moving all four
extremities and responding appropriately to questions though
mildly sedated prior to transfer to the floor.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt was minimally responsive to sternal
rub and did not withdraw to focal stimuli.  She was notably
tachypneic and eyes were deviated to right side.  She was able
to track to left with stimuli and would intermittently open eyes
to command.   Pt had an ABG 7.4/36/92 with lactate of 3.5 and
CXR showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  Due to concern for
acute intracranial hemmorrhage, she was taken down for a stat CT
head.  On return to the floor, pt was given narcan without any
significant change in mental status.  Neuro was consulted for
possible acute stroke and within a few minutes, she became more
responsive, opening eyes spontaneously. By the time neuro came
to bedside, pt was able to verbalize her name and was noted to
be using the right arm and had left sided deficit.  A CODE
stroke was called and pt was taken for urgent CTA head which did
not show any vessel obstruction and TPA was felt unlikely to be
helpful.  Perfusion images confirmed right temporal
hypoperfusion consistent with clinical exam and likely right MCA
infarct.  ICU consult was initiated and pt's guardian was
notified.  Pt was given Vanc/Cefepime and Aspirin 300mg PR while
awaiting ICU transfer.  She was lying flat per neuro recs and
was noted to be spitting up bilious emesis.  Head of bed was
elevated and pt was suctionned prior to transferred to the ICU
for closer monitoring of airway and management of acute
pneumonia.

Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Developmental Delay
Mirizzi Syndrome
COPD


Social History:
At baseline, pt lives at a nursing home and is able to feed
herself, undress and can transfer from chair to bed but is
otherwise wheelchair bound.  No smoking/ETOH history documented.

none relevant to this hospitalization.

ERCP [**2182-10-17**]
Procedures: A plastic stent was removed.
Impression: 2 balloon sweeps were performed with a small stone,
sludge and debris removed. A 1.5 cm biliary stricture in mid-CBD
compatible with known cystic duct stone and mirrizi syndrome was
visualized. A 10 F 5cm double pigtailed catheter was placed.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum.

CXR [**2182-10-17**] IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia with
atelectasis or pneumonia at the left base.
.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-severe
intracranial atherosclerotic disease with findings suggestive of
decreased perfusion to the right MCA/PCA watershed region. The
findings may represent cerebral ischemia in the setting of
hypovolemia, hypotension or other causes of decreased cardiac
output.
.
Cardiac Echo: IMPRESSION: Small LV cavity size with mild
symmetric LVH and hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
Consequently, there is a mild to moderate LV outflow tract
gradient. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
.
RUE LENI IMPRESSION: Partially occlusive thrombus in the right
basilic and axillary veins at site of PICC line. Clot does not
extend more centrally.
.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY) PORT IMPRESSION: Limited view of the
abdomen demonstrating no evidence for obstruction. Bladder
stone.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 y/o F with PMhx of Developmental Delay, COPD, HL, HTN and
Mirizzi syndrome who presented on [**10-17**] for elective ERCP. Pt
was noted to have emesis on her gown in the post procedure suite
with diffuse wheezes and low grade temp. It was thought likely
that she had an aspiration event and when she was arrived on the
floor, she had a profoundly depressed mental status, tachypnea
and fever to 101.9.  Further stat work up revealed evidence of
aspiration PNA, leukocytosis and elevated lactate.  Initial head
imaging was unrevealing. However, she became more alert and was
noted to have an acute left sided deficit. CODE STROKE was
called and CTA/perfusion images confirmed right sided
hypoperfusion likely consistent with right MCA stroke.  Neuro
felt there was no indication for TPA given patent intracranial
vessels and on return to the floor, pt was noted to have bilious
secretions that she was having difficulty clearing.  She was
transferred to the ICU for airway monitoring overnight. Pt was
called out to the floor when she was able to cough and spit up
secretions.  She was noted to have a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status, sometimes will respond to commands and other times will
not.  BP was allowed to autoregulate for the first 72 hrs post
event and pt was continued on Aspirin 300mg daily.  She was
noted to have recovery of left arm function and was answering
yes/no to questions.

She was seen by PT/OT who recommended ongoing therapy upon
return to NH.
After discussion with HCP/guardian, decision was made to avoid
follow up MRI as it was not likely to change care plan and pt
was unlikely to tolerate the procedure.  Echo was performed to
rule out cardioembolic source which did not show any thrombus.
Lipid panel showed LDL in the 93, and Hgb A1c 9.4.  She was
hyperglycemic during the hospitalization, and she was started on
Lantus and sliding scale insulin.
.
Aspiration PNA: Pt was noted to have aspiration event s/p
procedure and was monitored in the ICU for 24hrs given concern
for her ability to protect airway .  Leukocytosis, lactate and
fevers resolved after initiation of Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
Respiratory status improved and pt had a PICC placed and she
completed a course of antibiotics.

Upper Extremity DVT- Patient was subsequently developed a DVT
associated with the PICC line. The PICC line was discontinued
and she was started on Lovenox.  Once a PEG tube was placed, she
was started on Warfarin for a goal INR of [**2-6**].  Please follow
INR closely and titrate prn.  She received her first dose of
