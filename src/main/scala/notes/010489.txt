History of Present Illness:
67 y/o M with a PMHx of CAD s/p 5v CABG and multple PCI, sCHF EF
20%, HTN, DM2, CKD (bl Cr 2.0), ITP, hx of GIB, OSA on home o2
who was found unconscious by neighbor. Pt without recollection
of event; currently intubated. Per EMS, was apneic in
respiratory distress and an attempt to intubate in the field was
made unsuccessfully. He was brought to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, found
to be hypoxic to 80% on RA and in respiratory distress per
report. He was given Etomidate 16mg & Succinylcholine 150mg x1
and intubated. Had CXR that showed stable opacity in L mid-zone,
and had a Head/neck CT that was negative for bleed or fracture.
An ABG at 9pm after intubation was 7.19 35 372. Was transferred
to [**Hospital1 **] for further w/u.
.
In the ED, his VS on transfer were: HR 70, BP 105/56, RR 16,
100% on the vent. His BP remained in the 100/50 range and he was
started on a dobutamine gtt @ 5mcg/hr. This was eventually
titrated up to 10mcg/hr. He was given 3L IVF hydration and
Levaquin 500mg IV x1, Flagyl 500mg IV x1, Decadron 10mg IV x1,
CTX 1gm x1, and Versed 2mg x1. He was given a bag of platelets
and admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
On arrival, pt denies any CP, SOB, air hunger, abd pain. He
continued to have persistent BMs here in the ICU.

Radiology:
CXR [**9-8**]:
1. Limited study due to lack of IV contrast.
2. No secondary signs of bowel ischemia.
3. Mild CHF.
4. Nonspecific perihepatic fluid.
5. Extensive abdominal vascular calcifications including at the
right renal artery ostium with a resultant chronic ischemic
atrophic right kidney.
.
CXR [**9-10**]:
A pacer device is seen with the lead in the right ventricle. The
sternotomy wires intact. There is a left lower lobe and left
lingular hazy opacity concerning for consolidation versus
atelectasis. This is relatively unchanged since previous
examination. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but
stable. There is no pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 y/o M with a PMHx of CAD s/p 5v CABG and multple PCI, sCHF EF
20%, HTN, DM2, CKD (bl Cr 2.0), ITP, hx of GIB, OSA on home o2
initially admitted here with syncope of unclear etiology, mild
hypoxia, hypotension.
.
1. Respiratory Failure
Found in respiratory distress per EMS report, with unclear
etiology. CXR does not show overwhelming CHF or PNA. No fever,
sputum or WBC noted. Intubated at OSH on [**9-8**] and was
subsequently extubated at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-9**].  He was quickly weaned
down to his baseline o2 requirement of 3L NC with minimal
diuresis.  On [**Month/Year (2) **], appeared euvolemic, and he was
instructed to follow up with his cardiologist and pulmonary
doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
.
2. Hypotension/Syncope
Initially admitted to the MICU with hypotension of unclear
etiology - no infection/sepsis was ever identified.  Had
syncopal event of unclear etiology that may have contributed to
hypotension it may have even been a mechanical fall. Unclear.
His pacer was interrogated on admission by the EP service with
no events found.  He initially on peripheral dobutamine
temporarily but this was quickly weaned off on his arrival to
the MICU.  His home BP meds were initially held, and
reintroduced slowly.  He was discharged on Lisinopril 5mg daily,
and Toprol XL 50mg daily.  He was instructed to discuss with his
cardiologist regarding titrating his Toprol XL back to his
previous level of 125mg daily. He was advised not to take so
many sedating medications such as vicodin, ambien, and
lorazepam.
.
3. CHF
Pt with hx of sCHF with EF 20%.  Initially in respiratory
disterss with ? mild CHF that responded to his home level of
diuretics.  Weaned down to his baseline o2 requirement of 3L NC
satting 96-99% on day of [**Last Name (Titles) **].  His ASA, bblocker, ACE and
home lasix dose were continued during his hospitalization.  He
was instructed to follow up with his cardiologist/PCP to titrate
back up his Bblocker as his BP tolerates.
.
4. Diarrhea
Pt presented with syncope in setting of 1 episode of diarrhea.
Had c.dif x1 that was negative.  Resolved on admission.
.
5. CAD/NSTEMI
Here with diarrhea with guiaic + stools. EKG unchanged, with
mildly elev troponin/CK-MB in setting of ARF. Troponins peaked
at 1.55 and now are trending down. Cards consulted - diagnosed
with NSTEMI.  Cards agreed with continuing ASA/Plavix, holding
on Hep gtt given hx of GIB and mildly guiaic (+) stool.  His
BBlocker, statin and ACE were continued.  He was discharged on
his home meds and given a prescription for nitroglycerin for
angina as needed.
