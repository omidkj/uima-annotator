Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7567**]
Chief Complaint:
aphasia -> code stroke

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85yo woman with a PMHx significant for
afib on coumadin, DM2, HTN, dilated cardiomyopathy and recently
diagnosed PNA and E Coli UTI (on abx) who presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
with "aphasia" concerning for stroke.  She had been in her USOH
(lives at the [**Hospital3 2558**]) until one hour prior to
presentation when she was last seen well.  She was then found to
unresponsive there.  Further details are not known.  She was
then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.   Of note, she had been
diagnosed with PNA (unknown location in lung) as well as an E
Coli UTI and was treated with levaquin for the PNA and augmentin
for the UTI.  In addition, her coumadin was held on [**6-5**] [**2-5**] an
INR of 5.09 on [**6-4**] (she was also given vitamin K to reverse her
INR).  In the ambulance, initial VS were: BP: 80/50 RR: 16 T: 97
93% RA FS: 331.

Upon arrival to the ED a Code STROKE was called.  However, she
had left gaze deviation with myoclonic jerking of her LLE which
progressed to pursing movements of her lips.  Concerned about
seizure, she was loaded with 2mg of IM LZP twice (five minute
interval) with no resolution of sx.  20mg/kg of PHT was
ordered and she ceased to clinically seize afterwards, though
had persistently decreased responsiveness and left gaze
deviation.  NCHCT showed global atrophy, but no acute process.

Past Medical History:
- Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on Coumadin
- Hypertension/moderate left ventricular hypertrophy
- Hyperlipidemia, previously on atorvastatin
- Nonischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 35%, s/p biventricular/ICD
pacer.
- Type 2 diabetes c/b retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy
- Chronic kidney disease: baseline Cr 1.9 in [**6-13**]
- Rheumatic fever as a child
- s/p hysterectomy
- Stable 10x15x17cm cystic structure in left pelvis
Seen two weeks ago for diarrhea and subsequently discharged

Social History:
Had previously been living in [**Hospital3 **] at Foley House but
was moved to [**Hospital3 2558**] for rehab 2 weeks PTA given general
medical deterioration . Son recently died in [**Month (only) 958**] and she has
been gradually declining per her daughter since then.
Daughter is health care proxy. Also has four grandchildren,
three great grandchildren

CT head [**2128-6-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intracranial process.  If there remains a high
clinical concern for acute ischemia, MRI could be considered for
more sensitive examination.
2.  Moderate prominence of the ventricles, out of proportion to
sulci,
denoting central atrophy, correlate with any clinical history
for NPH.
3.  Opacification of the left sphenoid sinus.
4.  Soft tissue lesions within the subcutaneous fat posterior to
the upper
cervical neck, also seen on the [**2125**] study.

EEG [**2128-6-5**]:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG because of severe
diffuse
background slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies. Much
of the
EEG is obscured by diffuse EMG artifact. These findings are
indicative
of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is etiologically
non-
specific. No electrographic seizures are present.

CXR [**2128-6-5**]:
IMPRESSION:  More dense opacity at the left lung base,
silhouetting the
hemidiaphragm likely in part due to pleural effusion with
underlying
consolidation not excluded. Pulmonary vascular congestion as on
prior and
cardiomegaly.

CXR [**2128-6-7**]:
Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema which developed between [**6-5**]
and [**6-6**] has improved, though severe cardiomegaly has not.
Moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged.  There is no
pneumothorax.  Transvenous atriobiventricular pacer
defibrillator leads are unch
