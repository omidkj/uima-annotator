Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2197-1-25**]  AVR ( 23 mm CE Magna pericardial)/Resect. LAA


History of Present Illness:
 Mrs. [**Known lastname 21212**] is an 85 year old female with a PMH significant for
severe AS, recently diagnosed AF, HTN, HLD, and possible COPD
who presents with progressive shortness of breath. The patient
presented to her PCP, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**1-12**] complaining of [**4-20**] days
of palpitations and was found to be in AF with RVR. At that
time, her atenolol was increased and she was started on
coumadin. She then presented to her PCP today complaining of
progressively increasing shortness of breath and was sent to the
ED for further evaluation. Of note, the patient has had chronic
shortness of breath that is likely multifactorial in the setting
of deconditioning, possible mild COPD, and severe AS. She states
that at baseline, she can walk only from her bed to her bathroom
(15 feet) before developing dyspnea, and that this is worse in
the past few days. She also reports having gained approximately
2 lbs/month for the past year.
.
On initial presentation to the BIMDC ED, VS 98.3 124 127/88 20
94%RA. The patient had an ECG that demonstrated AF with RVR, a
CTA that was negative for PE or dissection, and a CXR that did
not demonstrate an acute cardiopulmonary process. She received
10 mg IV diltiazem and 30 mg po diltiazem, and was admitted to
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for further management.
.
Currently, the patient is resting comfortably without
complaints. Denies any CP/SOB, f/c/s, n/v/d, abd pain, HA,
palpitations, orthopnea, PND, diaphoresis, or pain radiating to
her jaw or shoulder or back.
.
ROS: Patient reports 3 months of expiratory wheezing. As above,
otherwise negative. Cardiac review of systems is notable for
absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Final Report
INDICATION: 85-year-old woman status post AV replacement.
Evaluate for
pneumothorax status post line change over a wire.
COMPARISON: Multiple priors, most recent portable AP chest
radiograph
[**2197-1-27**] at 11:19 a.m.
FINDINGS: Right internal jugular line tip projects over the
cavoatrial
junction. There is no pneumothorax. No focal parenchymal opacity
suggesting pneumonia. There is no overt pulmonary edema. Minimal
atelectasis is once again noted in the retrocardiac region,
unchanged from radiograph obtained earlier on the same day.
Borderline cardiomegaly is once again noted, unchanged from the
radiograph obtained earlier today.
IMPRESSION: Right IJ tip is at the cavoatrial junction with no
evidence of
pneumothorax. Otherwise, no interval change since chest
radiograph obtained earlier today.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
