Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment on [**2101-1-23**]. She was initially admitted
to the ICU as a prophylactic measure due to the severity of her
gallbladder disease. She underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy
tube placement on [**2101-1-23**] and was started on empiric zosyn.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. She remained
hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the floor on HD2

Neuro: The patient received IV dilaudid intially with good
effect and adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake,
the patient was transitioned to oral tylenol with good pain
control. After the choleycstostomy tube was placed, patient's
pain improved significantly and she had no complaints during the
remainder of her stay.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: The patient was made NPO with IV fluids. After the
cholecystostomy tube was placed, the patient's diet was advanced
to regular, which was well tolerated. Patient's intake and
output were closely monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when
necessary.  Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted
when necessary.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection. Initially the patient's
WBC was 20.4, but this trended down to 6.6 on HD3. The patient
remained afebrile during her stay. The fluid from the drain
showed GNR/GPRs, but the cultures were pending at time of
discharge. The patient was started on zosyn upon admission and
was maintained on this during her stay. She will be sent home
with one week of augmentin. The drain was left to gravity bag
and will remain this way until the patient follows up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
her stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; The patient received two units of FFP prior to
cholecystostomy placement for an INR of 1.7. The patient was
restarted on her coumadin when tolerating po intake.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding, and pain was well controlled.  The
patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions
with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge
