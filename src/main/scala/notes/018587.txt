MICRO:
Blood Cx ([**12-8**], [**12-9**]): MSSA
Urine Cx ([**12-9**]): E. coli, pansensitive
Chest Wall wound Cx ([**12-10**]): MSSA
Sternotomy Wire Cx ([**12-11**]): MSSA
.
RADIOLOGY:
CXR ([**12-8**]): IMPRESSION: Patchy retrocardiac opacity may
represent consolidation or atelectasis. There is also a small
left pleural effusion.
.
Chest U/S ([**12-9**]): IMPRESSION: Fluid/debris containing
collection within the subcutaneous tissues of the sternum in the
region of the patient's chest wall defect which may represent an
abscess or hematoma. Ultrasound-guided aspiration could be
performed, as clinically indicated, for therapeutic/diagnostic
purposes.
.
CT Torso ([**12-10**]): IMPRESSION:
1. New, multiple foci of gas seen within the sternal soft
tissues, with a small focus of gas seen in the left superior
mediastinum. Findings are concerning for underlying infection.
No drainable collection is identified.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis
and infiltrate. Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
3. Distended gallbladder, with evidence of sludge and stones
within. Clinical correlation recommended. Ultrasound would be
recommended for further evaluation if there is concern for
cholecystitis. This was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10752**] at 3:30
p.m. [**2159-12-11**].
4. Moderate amount of free fluid seen is within the abdomen and
pelvis. Soft tissue stranding suggesting anasarca.
5. Coronary calcifications, prosthetic aortic valve noted.
.
Renal U/S ([**12-10**]): IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Normal-sized
kidneys. Mild amount of ascitic fluid.
.
TTE ([**12-10**]): The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%) The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-7-17**], the
rhythm now appears to be atrial fibrillation, the right
ventricular cavity is now dilated, and the severity of pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is now lower. The bioprosthetic mitral
valve gradient and severity of aortic regurgitation are similar.
.
TEE ([**12-11**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal. There is symmetric LVH. Right ventricular function may
be depressed (not fully visualized). There are complex (>4mm)
non-mobile atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present and appears
well seated. The aortic valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move
normally. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**2-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: No vegetation or abscess identified
.
Abdomen Film ([**12-12**]): FINDINGS: Supine and upright abdominal
radiographs. Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with residual
contrast seen within the colon. Tip of NG tube is seen within
the stomach. There is no evidence of intra-abdominal free air.
There is right basilar atelectasis and pleural effusion. Median
sternotomy wires and Foley catheter are identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
.
Liver/GB U/S ([**12-15**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Distended gallbladder containing sludge with trace
pericholecystic fluid. Although there are no specific signs for
acute cholecystitis, a HIDA scan would be necessary to exclude
the possibility of acalculous cholecystitis.
2. Right pleural effusion and atelectasis.
.
CXR ([**1-1**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-31**],
there has been a substantial increase in opacification
bilaterally, especially on the left, consistent with rapid
acc
