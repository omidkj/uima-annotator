Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred for endocarditis and DIC

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE
CVL
mechanical ventilation
multiple thorocenteses with pigtail cath placed once

History of Present Illness:
Patient intubated and sedated. Information is taken from OSH
records and discussion with OSH physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 67201**]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 67202**].
.
44 yo F with questionable history of drug abuse who presented to
an OSH with back pain and knee pain. Per OSH records, on
[**2154-9-22**] the patient called EMS because she did not feel well.
She was brought to [**Hospital3 4107**] and found to be lethargic.
Her original vitals at 5pm on [**2154-9-22**] were T 96.8, BP 76/52, HR
95, O2sat 87% on RA. Her sats came up with 4L NC to 94%. Her tox
screen showed opiates and tricyclics. She was given narcan x1
and she woke up suddenly and was combative. She then had bloody
emesis/sputum (unclear) x1. She had blood cultures drawn and an
LP which only one tube was analyzed and showed 240,000 RBC and
1200 WBC. Blood cultures came back with coag positive staph in
about 12hrs. She may have had hemopytisis as well per report.
.
She became more hypoxic on a NRB and they intubated her and
placed a LSC line before transport to [**Hospital1 18**]. SHe was transferred
for TEE and further work up.

Studies:
at OSH:
ECHO: reportedly had TTE showing large TV vegetation with
pulmonary hypertension. On one note I saw an EF 60% with normal
AV and RV function. Do not have official report.
.
CT head without contrast: no midline shift; no bleed
.
KUB: hepatomegaly and spleenomegaly
.
STUDIES AT [**Hospital1 18**]:
TEE: [**2154-10-2**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are abnormal and there is a moderate-sized
vegetation on the posterior mitral valve leaflet that measures
0.4cm by 0.7cm. Mild to moderate ([**12-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen and there is a suggestion of posterior leaflet perforation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened and there is a
large, mobile vegetation on the septal tricuspid valve leaflet
that measures 2.4cm by 0.5cm. The vegetation extends to the base
of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve near the aortic
root. No definite aortic root abscess is seen. No fistula is
seen.
IMPRESSION: Large tricuspid valve vegetation and moderate mitral
valve vegetation.
Compared to the prior study of [**2154-9-24**], the tricuspid and
mitral vegetations appear larger.
.
EKG: sinus tach with rate in 100s, prolonged PR about 220ms, Not
much change from EKG from OSH. No older ones for comparison.
.
[**2154-9-25**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1093**]:
1. Limited study, without evidence of epidural abscess or cord
compression.
2. Retropharyngeal fluid of uncertain significance, but
obviously an inflammatory/infectious etiology needs to be
considered.
.
[**9-25**] MRA MRI Brain:
Multiple tiny foci of elevated T2 signal within the cerebral
hemispheres as noted above. These findings are nonspecific in
etiology but could indicate the presence of multiple small
infarcts, including those secondary to sepsis.
This is a normal study. However, as mycotic aneurysms are often
peripheral in location, this study does not sufficiently cover
this portion of the vascular tree. If there is serious concern
for this specific pathology, conventional angiography remains
the "gold standard" for its detection.
.
[**9-28**] Pleural Fluid: neg malignant cells
.
[**10-1**] TEE:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are abnormal and there is a moderate-sized
vegetation on the posterior mitral valve leaflet that measures
0.4cm by 0.7cm. Mild to moderate ([**12-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen and there is a suggestion of posterior leaflet perforation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened and there is a
large, mobile vegetation on the septal tricuspid valve leaflet
that measures 2.4cm by 0.5cm. The vegetation extends to the base
of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve near the aortic
root. No defininte aortic root abscess is seen. No fistula is
seen.
IMPRESSION: Large tricuspid valve vegetation and moderate mitral
valve vegetation.
Compared to the prior study of [**2154-9-24**], the tricuspid and
mitral vegetations appear larger.
.
[**10-5**]: LENI: Neg
.
[**10-16**]: CT Chest, Abd, Pelvis:
1. Slight improvement in extensive bilateral parenchymal lung
abnormalities including cavitary nodules, in keeping with
evolving septic emboli and multilobar pneumonia. There are
underlying emphysematous changes most notably at the apices.
Many of these areas of lucency do have thicker walls than
expected for simple emphysema, and consideration should be given
to PCP if not already considered. Improving pulmonary edema.
Follow-up to resolution advised.
2. No intra-abdominal abscess identified, although lack of
contrast limits the examination.
3. Right proximal femoral lucency which is incompletely
characterized, and followup plain film of the femur should be
performed when clinically able.
.
[**10-16**]: TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal mild
hypokinesis of the anterior septum. The remaining segments
contract well (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are milldy
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse
