Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5395**] was a same day admit following pre-operative testing
as an outpatient. On admit day she was brought to the operating
room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 3.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Surgery was
uneventful and she was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. She was weaned from sedation,
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated later on op day.
On post-op day one she was transferred to the cardiac surgery
step-down floor for continued monitoring. Beta blockers and
diuretics were initiated. She was gently diuresed towards pre-op
wt and her beta blockers were adjusted for maximum BP and heart
rate control. On post-op day two her chest tubes and Foley
catheter were removed. Epicardial pacing wires were removed on
post-op day three. Ms. [**Known lastname 5395**] appeared to be doing will without
complications until post-op day four when she developed an
episode of atrial fibrillation. She also had an episode on
post-op day five which required an Amiodarone bolus and drip.
This was eventually converted to Amiodarone by mouth and Heparin
was initiated and continued until she was therapeutic with
Coumadin (titrated for a goal INR 2-2.5). Nystatin swish and
swallow was given on post-op day five for oral thrush. Over the
next several days she was stable and awaiting a therapeutic INR.
On post-op day 10 she was started on antibiotics for an open
area on her sternal incision. Otherwise she appeared to be doing
well and was discharged home with VNA services. VNA will do
wound checks and dressing changes. She will return for a wound
check in [**2-13**] days. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will follow her INR and adjust
Coumadin for a goal INR of [**1-14**].5.
