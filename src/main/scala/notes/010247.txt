History of Present Illness:
51y/o gentleman with h/o renal Tx [**2149**], DM2, CAD, HTN, poly subs
abuse, chronic pancreatitis recent admitted last week with
abdominal pain presents with presents with dyspnea of 3 days
duration with a productive cough. In the ER he was tachypneic to
22-30s, O2 sat 90 on RA. He was given multiple nebulizer
treatments, but ultimately was admitted to the MICU for
respiratory distress. ECG unchanged, CXR PA and LAT with no
evidence of PNA. Given vanco/levo then received solumedrol 125mg
IV. He also received 2 liters of NS.

In ICU he was started on broad spectrum ABX for immunocopromised
state. He was continued on Nebs, solumedrol and given lasix
which helped him diurese to -1.3L. On the following day, viral
screen returned positive for RSV (likely from grand child) and
abx were stopped/transitioned to PO prednisone. His dyspnea
improved and he is satting well on 3L nasal canula.

Additionally, his FSBG was very elevated in the setting of
steriods and he briefly required an insulin gtt. Once on the
floor, he was transitioned back to Novolin 70/30 (NPH/Regular)
with an increase in his home dosing to 24units QAM and 28units
QPM.

CXR PA and LAT: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
.
EKG: NSR, rate 77, Leftward axis, LVH by aVL criteria, ST
elevations in V1-V3 with depressions and TWI in V5-V6 all likely
from LVH. Unchanged from prior
.
ECHO [**1-/2153**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis
(area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild to moderate ([**2-1**]+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2147-7-6**], the previously described wall motion
abnormality is not detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6164**] is a 51 y/o gentleman with h/o ESRD s/p renal
transplant, DM, and polysubstance abuse who presented with
worsening dyspnea secondary to RSV infection.

1. Dyspnea:  Patient presented with acute respiratory
decompensation and wheezing and was found to be RSV positive.
He was admitted to the MICU for management, where he responded
well to nebulizer treatments and was started on IV solumedrol
followed by oral prednisone.  He also responded well to some
diuresis with furosemide while in the ICU.  On discharge, he was
continued on an oral prednisone taper and was provided a
prescription for Combivent MDI.

2. Mild Volume Overload:  Patient has a history of diastolic CHF
(EF>55%) and became volume overloaded while in the MICU, with a
BNP elevated to 872.  He responed well to furosemide and was
without signs of volume overload at the time of discharge.

3. DM Type 2:  Patient is on 70/30 insulin regimen at home, with
20 units in the AM and 24 units in the PM.  Given his current
prednisone treatment and elevated FSBG into the 200s, his
regimen was increased to 24 QAM and 28 QPM while on prednisone,
with instructions to resume his home dosing upon completion of
his prednisone taper.

4. HTN:  Mr. [**Known lastname 6164**] was continued on his home regimen including
amlodipine, clonidine, metoprolol.

5. Renal Transplant:  Followed by renal transplant team while in
hospital.  Continue on his immunosuppression with Tacrolimus and
CellCept.

6. Abdominal pain:  Recent kidney stone diagnosed, but continued
on opioid pain management during hospitalization.

going about one month prior to admission.
