chest x-ray - Left lower lobe collapse with small left shift of
the mediastinum. Increased opacity at left upper lung likely
reflects consolidation due to infectious etiology. There may
also be a left pleural effusion. A left-sided [**Location (un) 21851**]
resulting in collapse and post-obstructive consolidation cannot
be ruled out. Right lung well aerated.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 year-old female with a history of moderate COPD, atrial
fibrillation, CAD who presents with fever, leukocytosis, and
chest x-ray consistent with new LUL consolidation consistent
with healthcare associated pneumonia.
.
# Pneumonia Patient presented with fever, worsening cough,
hypotension, decreasing oxygen saturating likely with SIRS
symptoms with evidence of new infiltrate on chest x-ray
concerning for healthcare associated pneumonia with a previous
history of MRSA in the sputum.  Confirmed code status with
patient on admission to be DNR/DNI. Patient was very clear on
her goals of care. Patient had previously seen Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8513**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in
pulmonary clinic and code status was confirmed at that time as
well. Patient did not want central lines placed or any invasive
procedures done. Placed patient on nasal cannula with escalating
O2 doses, and then eventually CPAP and started broad spectrum
antibiotics with Levoquin 750 mg PO q 24, Vancomycin 1 g q 12
hrs, Ceftriaxone 1 g q24 hours to cover for possible MRSA
previously seen in sputum, also for strep pneumo and good gram
negative coverage. Urine legionella was sent and was pending at
the time.  Patient had a small troponin of 0.23 with flat CKs
and CK-MBs with some New T wave inversion in the lateral leads
likely secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of
significant ischemic cardiomyopathy and in the setting of
respiratory compromise.  Patient was chest pain free. Patient
became apneic and desaturated first to the 80s, and then became
bradycardic very quickly - likely thought to be due to acute
mucus plugging. Patient did not respond to CPAP and expired very
quickly. The family was called immediately on patient's initial
decompensation, however patient expired quickly afterwards, so
family was not at the bedside.
