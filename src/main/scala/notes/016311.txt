Chief Complaint:
FALL

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PERCUTANEOUS GASTRIC TUBE PLACEMENT

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 85 y/o female who lives independently until yesterday when
she fell down a flight of stairs.  Per her family, she was
neurologically unchanged until this morning when she
demonstrated
confusion and difficulty ambulating.  She was taken to an
outside
hospital where head CT revealed 3mm left parietal subdural
hematoma and bilateral temporal lobe contusions.  There was no
evidence of mass effect or midline shift.  She was transferred
to
[**Hospital1 18**] ER for higher level of care.

Pertinent Results:
CT:
head CT [**2136-3-31**]- Bitemporal hemorrhagic contusions with
surrounding edema and subarachnoid blood.  3mm left parietal
subdural hematoma and bilateral
temporal lobe contusions.  There was no evidence of mass effect
or midline shift.
Head CT [**2136-4-1**]: 1.  Unchanged appearance of small bilateral
extra-axial fluid collections that may represent enlarged
subarachnoid spaces, although chronic subdural hematomas or
subdural hygromas cannot be excluded. 2.  Stable appearance of
bitemporal hemorrhagic contusion with surrounding edema and
subarachnoid blood.  No new focus of hemorrhage is identified.
Head CT [**2136-4-4**]: No significant change since the prior study
[**2136-4-1**].
.
CT c-spine [**2136-4-4**]: 1.  Extensive multilevel degenerative
changes in the cervical spine, most prominent at C5-6, C6-7 and
C7-T1 levels, with posterior osteophytes, causing mild
indentation on the ventral thecal sac.
2.  Mild bulging of the posterior cortex of the C4, with a small
focus of bony discontinuity, causing mild indentation on the
ventral thecal sac.  No evidence of cord compression (CT is
limited for a more accurate assessment of intrathecal details).
CT T/L spine [**2136-4-4**]: 1.  Moderate collapse of the T5 vertebral
body, diffusely, with mild bulging of the posterior cortex, with
small posterior osteophyte, causing mild indentation on the
ventral thecal sac.  Mild focal kyphotic deformity is noted at
this level. 2.  Severe collapse of the T11 and L1 vertebral
bodies, especially involving the anterior and the middle
portions of the vertebral bodies with mild bulging of the
posterior cortex, causing mild indentation on the ventral thecal
sac. Continuity of the cortical outline posteriorly is not well
appreciated at the level of L1, which may be due to cortical
break/osteopenia-related lucency. Focal kyphotic deformity noted
at the level of L1.  Degenerative changes are noted in the
adjacent T12-L1 with vacuum phenomena.

 CARDIAC ECHO
===============
The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The
left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with a small LV cavity size.
There is no obvious LVOT gradient. Diastolic dysfunction. Mild
aortic stenosis. At least mild aortic and mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 85yo female admitted with left parietal SDH with [**Hospital1 **]
temporal contusions.
Patient loaded with dilantin and followed with q8hour dosing,
admited to neurosurgery ICU.  Several repeat head CTs were
stable with no significant increase in ICH.  Her ICH was managed
non-operatively.  Due to her multiple complex medical problems
(see below), the pt was transferred to the medicine inpatient
service on HD#11.

Hospital course by system:

Neuro: The patient's ICH were followed with several CT scans
that showed stable small hemorrhages with no significant
increase. The pt was originally loaded with dilantin but this
was transitioned to Keppra, given its fewer side effects. The pt
suffered no neurologic deficits from ICH.  However, due to the
pt's extended stay in the ICU she did suffer from delirium,
likely ICU delerium, requiring haldol and zyprexa as well as
upper extremity soft restraints that complete resolved after he
stay on the floor.

CV: The pt had a history of HTN and afib on admission treated
with lopressor, digoxin and coumadin.  While in the ICU she went
into RVR and required a diltiazem drip for several days.  A
cardiology consultation was obtained and the pt was weaned to IV
lopressor. Digoxin was continued. At baseline she was taking
HCTZ but required supplemental IV lasix for fluid overload. A
transthoracic echo showed mild aortic stenosis, mild or greater
aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation, with
ventricular enlargement, diastolic dysfunction with EF>55%.
Patient was continued on daily diuresis with lasix 20mg NG daily
with potassium supplementation with improving O2 requirement and
improvement in crackles on exam. Please continue titrate lasix
therapy until patient is evoluemic.
