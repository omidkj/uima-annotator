Pertinent Results:
[**2115-8-6**] ECHO
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-7-15**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased, although may
have been not as well visualized on prior study (image quality
was limited). Systolic anterior motion of the mitral chordal
structures is similar in appearance. The resting heart rate is
now faster. The pericardial effusion appears similar.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   84 year old woman with afib s/p cabg and avr
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   evaluate for infiltrate and effusions

Final Report
HISTORY: 84-year-old female with AFib status post CABG and
aortic valve
replacement. Please evaluate for infiltrate/effusions.

STUDY: Upright AP and lateral chest radiographs.

COMPARISON: [**2115-8-11**].

FINDINGS: Midline sternotomy wires are intact and unchanged from
previous
study. The heart and mediastinal contours are consistent with a
post-CABG
patient. There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
than the right.
The lungs are clear with no focal or lobar consolidation.
Pulmonary
vasculature is somewhat vague suggestive of pulmonary vascular
congestion.
There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right; mild
pulmonary vascular congestion; no pneumonia.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 55827**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2115-8-6**] for further
management of her shortness of breath. She was found to be in
atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone. She was
diuresed for volume overload. An echo showed no evidence of
tamponade. Amiodarone was stopped given that her atrial
fibrillation was a chronic condition. She was anticoagulated
with coumadin. Her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will assume
coumadin management as an outpatient. The neurology service was
consulted as she had a breif episode of word finding difficulty.
A head CT was not suggestive of an acute hemorrhage or infarct.
Ampicillin was started for a urinary tract infection. Free water
was restricted for hyponatremia. The physical therapy servicew
worked with her daily to increase her strength and mobility.
Flagyl was started for a question of c. difficile infection.

Ms. [**Known lastname 41323**] continued to make steady progress and was
discharged to rehabilitation on [**2115-8-15**]. She will follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist and her primary care physician as
an outpatient.
