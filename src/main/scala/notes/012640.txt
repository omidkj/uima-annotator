History of Present Illness:
71 y/o female with h/o CAD, CHF, DM, PVD presents after
surveillance carotid U/S showed an 80-99% occlusion of the [**Country **].
 She had a carotid stent placed on [**2158-1-27**], and this is felt to
be restenosis of that stent.  She has been totally asymptomatic
from this, and reports no lightheadedness, syncope, vision
changes, weakness, or vertigo.No TIA or past stroke.  No
N/V/dysuria/cahnges in BMs.  She also denies CP, SOB, orthopnea,
or PND.  She does report the ability to exercise(by walking
around big stores), but admits that she isn't able to get very
active.  Denies claudication, but says that she isn't able to
walk too far too fast.  Her recent cardiac hx is sig for CABG in
[**3-21**], carotid U/S [**6-22**] showing 80% right stenosis and <60% left
stenosis.  She had LE dopplers in [**8-22**] showing left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] and
infrapop arterial obstructive dx, with mild right infrapop dx.
She came in today symptom free and had her [**Country **] angioplastied,
but no new stent was placed.  She came to the CCU on neo to keep
BP b/t 140-160.

COMMENTS:
1.  Access was retrograde via the right CFA.
2.  Carotid arteries:  The RCCA had an unchanged 50% lesion. The
right
carotid ICA stent had a focal 99% in-stent lesion.  The [**Country **]
fills the
ACA, MCA and a fetal PCA on the ipsilateral side.
3.  POBA of the in-stent restenosis was performed with a 4.5 x
20 mm
Powersail.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. POBA of critical right ICA stent restenosis


Brief Hospital Course:
This was a 71 y/o female with h/o CAD, CHF, DM, PVD, who was
admitted s/p carotid angioplasty for a restenosed stent that was
placed [**1-22**].
1.Carotid angioplasty:  After her angioplasty, she came to the
floor bradycardic.  Likely a result of carotid sinus pressure
during the procedure producing an increase in vagal tone.  We
monitored her on telemetry.  Her BP was stable in the 150s
systolic.  She was put on a neosynephrine drip and a
nitroglycerin drip to keep her SBP between 140 and 160 due to
her recent carotid artery procedure.  Her home BP medications
were held.  Her nitro was quickly weaned, and her neosynephrine
was also slowely weaned.  She kept SBPs >130.  On D/C, her
lisinopril was started back at 2.5 mg qd, but all other BP meds
(metoprolol, lasix, norvasc) were held.  These can be restarted
as needed by her outpt PCP/cardiologist.
2.CAD: We kept her on [**Month/Year (2) **] and Plavix.  No acute issues.  Daily
ECGs were unchanged from her previous ECGs.  Her morning
hematocrit was slightly decreased from the previous day, but
this was felt to be dilutional, as she got fluids as an inpt.
She was having no symptoms at her current level.
3.PVD:No acute issues here.
4.Pump: She maintained her BP in the target range on neo, and
kept it sufficiently high when the neo was eventually weaned.
As above, her BP meds were held, and only lisinopril 2.5 qd was
restarted on D/C.
5.DM:She was initially on an insulin sliding scale, and her
glyburide was restarted when she began eating.  On D/C, we told
her to restart her metformin the next day(48 hrs post-cath).
Her blood sugars during admission were all in our acceptable
range.
6.Hypothyroidism: She was maintained on her home dose of
levothyroxine.
7.FEN: She was given maintenance fluids.  She quickly began
eating a diabetic/heart healthy diet.  No issues.  Her
creatinine was monitored post-cath, with no increase seen the
next morning.  Electrolytes were followed and remained WNL.
On D/C, she was feeling well, had no complaints, and was eating
and drinking without issue.  No symptoms of cerebral
hypoperfusion/stroke.  No CP or SOB.
