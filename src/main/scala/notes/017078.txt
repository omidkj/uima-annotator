Service:  Medicine Intensive Care Unit-Green

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old male with
a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction, status post motor vehicle accident on [**9-2**] with knee and wrist pain.  The patient denied any loss of
consciousness.  The patient was found to have left distal
radial and proximal fibular fractures and was recommended
nonsurgical management by Orthopedics and Plastic Services.
The patient was to be discharged on [**9-3**], however,
that evening he underwent an acute desaturation to 84% on his
nasal cannulas which then increased to 93% on a nonrebreather
mask.  The patient had a temperature of 100.4 orally, coarse
rhonchi and the blood pressure was stable.  An arterial blood
gases was done which showed 7.33/47/59.  There were no
changes on the electrocardiogram.  The patient stopped
intravenous fluids and got 10 mg of intravenous Lasix times
three and put out 500 cc of urine output.  The patient was
transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and went into
atrial fibrillation which he has a history of proximal atrial
fibrillation in the rates of 120 to 130s and the blood
pressure remained normotensive.  He was started on a Nitro
drip, Morphine Sulfate, Lopressor and white blood cell count
then went up to 17.2.  The patient then became hypoxic on
100% nonrebreather and was intubated in the Trauma Surgery
Intensive Care Unit and then transferred to the Medicine
Intensive Care Unit.  The patient got a chest computerized
tomography scan which was consistent with a pneumonia and no
pulmonary embolism.  He was started on Propofol for
intubation at that time and his systolic blood pressure
decreased in the 70s.  His temperature was 101 and with a
white blood cell count of 17.2 there was concern that the
patient was in septic [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was started on a
Neo-Synephrine drip at 3 mcg/kg/min.  The patient was swanned
with a central venous pressure of 12, pulmonary artery
pressure of 30/15 and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of
15/16.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Cerebrovascular accident,
right-sided with a left hemiparesis and contracture of his
left side; 2.  Status post myocardial infarction; 3.
Hypertension; 4.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Outpatient medications include
Aspirin and Zoloft.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  One beer per day, positive tobacco despite
being in a wheelchair and a left-sided hemiparesis the
patient lived alone.  The patient's guardian is [**Name (NI) 501**], his
daughter and he has two other sisters, [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) **]
who also live here in the [**Location (un) 86**] area.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general sedated in no distress.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, occasional
wheeze.  Cardiovascular, regular rate, no murmur, rub or
gallop.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, normal
bowel sounds.  Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Warm, 1+ pulses.  Neurological, sedated, left-sided
contracted.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 11.7, hematocrit
33.2, platelets 153, INR 1.3, sodium 137, potassium 4.0,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 22, BUN 20, creatinine 1.4, glucose
120, anion gap 14.  Fibrinogen 488, troponin less than .001
times three.  Creatinine kinase 238, 212, 173, amylase 55,
lactate 2.4.  Arterial blood gases was 7.37/42/122 on AC,
title volume 500, respiratory rate 14, FIO2 of 1.00 and 5
positive end-expiratory pressure.  Electrocardiogram showed
normal sinus rhythm at 76 beats/minute, 0.5 to [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depressions in V2 through V5 which improved.  Computerized
tomographic angiography of chest showed no pulmonary
embolism, bilateral lower lobe consolidation with air
bronchograms, associated collapse.  Chest x-ray, bilateral
basilar opacities, endotracheal tube, Swan in good position.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Respiratory distress - This was most
likely caused initially by aspiration pneumonia, believed to
have occurred while they were clearing his neck post trauma
as he had to lay flat on his back for prolonged periods of
time.  This became complicated by most likely a ventilatory
associated pneumonia because he grew out on [**2101-9-7**] from his bronchial lavage and sputum samples
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus that
was Vancomycin sensitive.  The respiratory failure was also
considered to be worse from the over-fluid resuscitation,
elitism congestive heart failure.  The patient completed a 14
day course of each Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  The
patient's blood cultures remained negative for no growth to
date while in the hospital.  The patient was intubated on
[**9-3**] and was extubated on [**2101-9-15**].  For most
of his intubation, the patient was on pressor support and
tolerated this well.

2.  Septic [**Year (4 digits) **].  The patient was considered to be in septic
[**Year (4 digits) **] on admission to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit as
felt by his high white blood cell count, fever to 102, low
systemic blood pressure and a high cardiac output with a low
SVR.  The patient was initially on Levophed but after
receiving several boluses of fluid the Levophed was
discontinued.  However, the fluid resuscitation lead to
congestive heart failure and the patient needed diuresis
after that time.

3.  Congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease - The
patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction but appeared to
be in heart failure.  An echocardiogram off of pressors
showed an ejection fraction of 40%, while on pressors the
ejection fraction was approximately 55%.  The patient was
placed on Lopressor to control his tachycardia and Lisinopril
for afterload reduction.  The patient also restarted his
Aspirin.

4.  Acute renal failure - Initially the patient had an
increase in his creatinine from his baseline of 0.6 up to
1.4.  The patient's creatinine responded to fluid boluses and
the acute renal failure was deemed to be secondary to
prerenal hypovolemia in the setting of septic [**Year (4 digits) **].

5.  Gastrointestinal - The computerized tomography scan of
the abdomen showed a question of an enlarged gallbladder.
There was a question of acalculus cholecystitis versus common
bile duct stone since there was an elevation in the total
bilirubin and direct bilirubin.  This was evaluated by HIDA
scan and there was not deemed to be any obstruction.  Over
time, the bilirubin trended back towards normal.  After
discussions with the trauma surgeons it was felt no
intervention needed to be performed.  The patient was
initially covered with Ampicillin for enterococcus and was
discontinued once it was felt the gallbladder was not
associated with his fevers or sepsis picture.  A percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed, after extubation the
patient was unable to tolerate swallowing and it was felt a
high aspiration risk after speech and swallow evaluation.  A
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed on
[**9-21**] so that the patient could continue to receive tube
feeds for nutrition.

6.  Alcohol withdrawal - There was a concern that the patient
was undergoing alcohol withdrawal with a history of minimal
alcohol use.  The patient was placed on a CIWA assessment
scale and now was tachycardiac and hypertensive at times.  It
was not felt that he was undergoing alcohol withdrawal per
the scale.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To a skilled nursing facility for
continued suctioning and chest and physical therapy to
increase his strength.
