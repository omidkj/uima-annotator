History of Present Illness:
66 yo right-handed M with history of renal/bladder cell
carcinoma s/p b/l nephrectomies c/b ESRD on HD x 3 weeks,
CABGx3, IDDM, HTN who presents with garbled speech, left arm
shaking, and left arm weakness after a fall two weeks ago.  Two
weeks ago, he was trying to get through the doorway when he fell
backwards and hit the back side of his head without LOC.
Starting one week ago he started having daily morning episode of
garbled speech that would last 15-25 minutes without language
difficulties.  Three days ago, he complained of left lip
numbness that last few seconds.  On the day of admission at 3
am, his wife noticed left arm trembling x 1 min with then
occured again at 5 am while patient was asleep.  He then woke up
at 6 am with inability to put his robe on because he had left
arm weakness.  At [**Hospital 1727**] hospital he had 2 min GTC seizure after
getting out of car, requiring 1 mg ativan. OSH noted [**11-21**]
weakness of the left arm and got CT head that showed acute on
chronic left SDH.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
.
Pt was loaded with dilantin 1 g, then bolused with 300 mg x2 for
continued seizure activity.  Neurology and Neurosurgery both saw
the patient and recommend medical management.  Serial CTs of
head did not shown any extension of the hematoma.  His neuro
exams did not show focal neuro deficits.

Past Medical History:
1. transitional renal and bladder cancer s/p left nephrectomy
and
bladder removal in [**11/2195**], then right nephrectomy in [**2199-2-25**]
2. IDDM
3. HTN
4.  Appendectomy
5. CAD s/p CABG
6. axonal and demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy and
myopathy of unknown etiology, worked up by [**Location (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name 557**] with
muscle biopsy and EMG/NCS

ivdu. occasional etoh.

EXT: warm, no c/c/e, 2+ left dp/pt pulses, 1+ right dp/pt pulses
NEURO:  CN2-12 intact, strength equal b/l, biceps/platellar
reflexes equal b/l, sensation intact throughout.


Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD [**2199-3-18**]:  moderate-sized subdural hemorrhage
surrounding the right superior parietooccipital region,
measuring 11.2 mm in maximum diameter. A small focus of
hypodensity within the anterior aspect of the hemorrhage
indicates possible acute supermiposed upon chronic bleeding.
There is minimal mass effect, and no shift of normally midline
structures. No additional areas of intracranial hemorrhage are
seen. There is no major vascular territorial infarction. Density
values of the brain parenchyma are preserved. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white
matter differentiation is preserved. The surrounding soft tissue
and osseous structures are normal.
.
CT HEAD [**2199-3-19**]: Mixed density subdural hematoma is again
evident along the right cerebral convexity. This displaces the
right cerebrum away from the skull and there is narrowing of the
sulci of the superior frontal and parietal lobes, as well as the
inferior temporal lobe. There is mild mass effect on the right
lateral ventricle and mild shift of structures towards the left.
This is unchanged since the previous study. IMPRESSION: Stable
appearance of the brain, compared to the study of the previous
day.

Brief Hospital Course:
66M CAD s/p CABG, metastatic bladder cancer s/p b/l
nephrectomies c/b ESRD on HD x 3 weeks presents from OSH s/p
fall 2 weeks ago.  Over past week, was noted by wife to have
garbled speech, and on day of presentation developed "shaking"
of left arm and generally looked unwell. At OSH, had witnessed
seizure; CT head showed SDH
.
FEVER:  Fever at time of presentation which resolved early on in
hospitalizaiton.  No obvious source was identified. Pt with
stoma on right lower abdomen and portacath in right thorax (both
did not show obvious signs of infection).  Pt had no elevated
WBC, no symptoms.  All blood cultures were negative.
.
SUBDURAL HEMATOMA:  repeat CTs showed stable hematoma.
Neurologic checks did not reveal a change in neurologic
condition from time of admission.  Neurosurgery followed Pt
during hospitalization and did not think surgucal intervention
to be appropriate.
.
SEIZURES:  Question of generalized tonic clonic seizure activity
at presentation.  Pt was loaded with dilantin and then given
standing dilantin therapy.  Dilantin levels were followed and
doses adjusted accordingly.  The Neurology service followed the
Pt during the hospitalization.
