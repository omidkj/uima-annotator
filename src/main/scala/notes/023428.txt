Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
 66 yo F with h/o CAD c/b CABGx3, HTN, HLD, poorly-controlled
IDDM and recurrent resistent UTIs with recent admission for
flash pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertensive urgency who
presents with worsening dyspnea and found to be in acute renal
failure with hyperkalemia. Pt was admitted from [**Date range (1) 17057**] where
she had a CTA to r/o PE as the origin of her dyspnea. She was
diuresed with her home regimen of lasix 20mg po BID. Her blood
pressure medications were continued (metoprolol, lisinopril and
spironolactone) and she was started on amlodipine 5mg po qday.
She was also being treated for a UTI with doxycycline. The
patient reports she was feeling well at home without complaints
until the day of admission around noon when she felt
hypoglycemic and her BS was 52. She then felt very short of
breath when trying to walk to the bathroom and her BP taken by
her husband was 172/50 so he brought her to the emergency room.
She denies any chest pain, cough, fevers, increased peripheral
edema, lightheadenss, vision changes. She does report dysuria
and trickling of urine (which she reports she gets with UTIs).
In the ED Intitial VS were 97.8 48 154/56 22 98%. Per report,
patient was on a stretcher in the ED, triggered for tachypnea in
the 40s and was found to have a BP in the 200s. A CXR was
performed which showed pulmonary edema and she was started on
BIPAP and lasix drip for presumed flash pulmonary edema and
transferred to the CCU for Nitro drip.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, She reports being able to walk up a flight of stairs
without stopping. Occasionally feels her heart racing if she is
walking on stairs but not at baseline. She denies PND or
orthopnea.

Imaging:
CXR [**2170-7-10**]: Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
effusions.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
.
Echo [**2170-7-11**]:
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). TDI E/e' >15,
suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Calcified tips of
papillary muscles. No MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Physiologic TR. Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting bradycardia (HR<60bpm).
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved regional and global systolic function. Borderline
pulmonary hypertension. Elevated estimated PCWP. Findings c/w
hypertensive heart disease.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-10-7**],
the findings are similar.

Renal Ultrasound [**2170-7-11**]:
1.  Normal-sized kidneys with a simple cyst in the left lower
pole and no
other focal abnormalities.
2.  No Doppler evidence of renal artery stenosis.
3.  Markedly elevated resistive indices bilaterally, which may
imply either diffuse chronic parenchymal renal disease or small
vessel changes from prolonged hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION
Ms. [**Known lastname 99281**] is a 66 year old female with history of coronary
artery disease (CAD) status post CABG in [**2165**] with LIMA to LAD,
SVG to OM1 and OM2, insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM), recurrent
urinary tract infections, who presented with dyspnea,
hypertensive emergency with renal failure and hyperkalemia.  She
was managed with a nitroglycerin drip in the CCU originally and
then transitioned to oral isosorbide nitrate and hydralazine.
