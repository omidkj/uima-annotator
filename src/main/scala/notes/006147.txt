Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3513**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP x 2.


History of Present Illness:
60 year-old male with history significant for severe nonischemic
hypertensive cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), ICD placement,diabetes who
presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting since the
morning of admission. The patient states he ate breakfast at 9
am, and approximately one hour later, the pain began and
continued to wax and wane throughout the day, often reaching
[**11-6**]. The pain was described as bandlike across his abdomen,
without radiation to the back. No aggravating factors other than
eating. The pain was alleviated with Morphine in the ED. The
patient has never had this type of pain in the past. The patient
also complained of nausea and vomiting, nonbilious/nonbloody.
The patient denied diarrhea, melena or hematochezia. He denies
any recent changes in his medications, recent travel, recent
alcohol use, history of gallstones or symptoms of biliary colic.

.
In the ED, the patient received one liter NS, morphine, and a
dose of levofloxacin. The patient was admitted to the MICU.
.
In the MICU he was given NS at 150cc/hr. Antibiotics were not
continued. The biliary team saw the patient and recommended
ERCP. The procedure was deferred due to the patient's INR. The
patient's pain was improved on transfer.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2176-7-2**]
FINDINGS:  The liver displays normal echotexture and
architecture.  No focal liver lesions are identified.  The
hepatic veins are dialated consistent with congestive heart
failure.  The main portal vein is patent with normal hepatopetal
flow. The gallbladder demonstrates mild wall thickening without
without intraluminal stone. There is a negative son[**Name (NI) 493**]
[**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign. There is no pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder
wall edema. There is no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary duct
dilatation with the common bile duct measuring 5 mm. There is no
right upper quadrant ascites. Partially visualized portion of
the pancreatic head and neck demonstrate no acute abnormality.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of cholecystitis.
2.  Prominent hepatic veins consistent with venous congestion.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2176-7-2**]
FINDINGS: There is stable cardiomegaly. Left-sided AICD device
noted with leads unchanged. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
identified. There is pulmonary vascular congestion although
slightly decreased when compared to previous. There is no
evidence of free intra-abdominal air.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2176-7-2**]
Atrial fibrillation
Indeterminate axis
Low limb lead QRS voltages
Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition
Nonspecific T wave abnormalities
Findings are nonspecific but clinical correlation is suggested
for possible in
part chronic pulmonary disease
Since previous tracing of [**2175-11-10**], no significant change
.
ERCP  [**2176-7-5**]
Impression: A plastic stent placed in the pancreatic duct was
found in the major papilla.
Evidence of a previous incomplete sphincterotomy was noted in
the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
A mild dilation was seen at the biliary tree.
There was a filling defect that appeared like sludge at the
biliary tree.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome.
Sludge was extracted successfully using a balloon catheter.
The plastic stent was removed.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year-old male with congestive heart failure (EF 20%), status
post ICD placement, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, chronic
renal failure presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting
for 24 hours prior to admission and found to have pancreatitis.

.
1. Pancreatitis: Elevated amylase/lipase consistent with
pancreatitis as the cause of the patient's abdominal pain. The
elevated alkaline phosphatase/bilirubin was suggestive of a
gallbladder etiology. There were no obvious gallstones seen on
ultrasound; ERCP showed abundant sludge, however. The pancreatic
duct was stented during the first ERCP but the common bile duct
was unable to be cannulated; this was achieved with the second
ERCP. During the second ERCP it was noted that the stent
initially placed in the pancreatic duct had migrated and this
was subsequently removed. Amiodarone is known to rarely cause
pancreatitis; the patient's amiodarone was held and was not
restarted on discharge. The patient remained afebrile, without
leukocytosis, and with normal lactate. Antibiotics were
therefore not indicated. The patient was initially maintained
NPO with intravenous hydration but tolerated clear liquids and
then a regular diet soon after the second ERCP. The patient's
pancreatic enzymes trended down quickly. The patient's coumadin
was held and the patient was transfused one unit fresh frozen
plasma prior to ERCP. Coumadin should be held for ten days
following ERCP and can be restarted [**7-15**].
.
2. Elevated transaminases: The patient has a history of elevated
transaminases and recently had an appointment in liver clinic;
etiology remains unknown. Recent hepatitis panel negative. The
patient's acute transaminase elevation was likely due to
gallbladder sludge. The patient's amiodarone and statin were
held and were not restarted prior to discharge. The patient had
follow-up scheduled with Hepatology for further outpatient
work-up.
.
3. Cardiac:
a. Vessels: Clean coronary catheterization in [**2165**]. The patient
had no EKG changes and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits
on this admission. The patient's statin was held in the setting
of elevated transaminas
