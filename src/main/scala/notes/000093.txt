Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a patient who has been
in the hospital since [**2115-12-20**], who was on the Medical
service and has subsequently been transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery service for an aortic valve
replacement.  Please see previous discharge summary for the
time period of [**2115-12-20**] to [**2116-1-6**].

This is a 31-year-old male who came into the hospital on
[**2115-12-20**] with a chief complaint of requesting detoxification.
The patient also complained of some abdominal pain on
admission, and was noted to have a fever of 104 Farenheit, a
white count of 17.  At that time, physical examination was
remarkable for Osler's nodes.  Blood cultures subsequently
grew methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus in four out
of four bottles.  CT scan of the abdomen at that time showed
a small wedge-shaped perfusion defect in the kidneys
bilaterally, and also wedge-shaped triangular low attenuation
areas in the spleen, which were consistent with septic
emboli.  Transesophageal echocardiogram showed a vegetation
on the aortic valve, and aortic insufficiency of 2+.

After sensitivities returned, the patient was started and
continued on oxacillin.  A subsequent transesophageal
echocardiogram performed on the [**12-27**] showed
perivalvular abscess and fistulous tract between the right
ventricle and the aorta.  An MRI of the head was done in
order to rule out septic emboli.  There was no evidence of
mycotic aneurysms.  In addition, secondary to the patient's
poor dentition, an Oral Surgery consult determined that it
would be beneficial to the patient's valve replacement if he
had 18 of his teeth removed, which was performed under
general anesthesia.  The patient was also tested for HIV,
hepatitis C and B, all of which were negative.

The patient was started on methadone for heroin withdrawal,
and, at the time the patient was admitted to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery service, he had been tapered down to
30 mg by mouth once daily.  On admission, the patient's
hematocrit was 37, and declined down to 23 to 24 at his
lowest.  Subsequent anemia workup was consistent with
iron-deficiency anemia with likely overlying anemia of
chronic disease.  The patient was started on iron and also
transfused one unit prior to being transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery service.  Stool guaiacs were negative
with one exception, which showed trace positivity.

The patient was preopped on [**2116-1-9**].  There were no
acute ST changes, and creatinine was 0.8, and hematocrit
25.1.  On physical examination, the patient was found to have
occasional crackles, and was subsequently given 10 mg of
intravenous lasix, to which he responded with good diuresis.

On [**2116-1-10**], the patient was brought to the
operating room, at which time an aortic valve replacement and
repair of right ventricular aortic abscess was performed.
The homograft was a #23 mm.  At that time, two arterial lines
were placed intraoperatively, as well as a Swan-Ganz
catheter.  Two ventricular wires and two atrial wires were
also placed, as well as two mediastinal and one left pleural
chest tube.  The patient was on cardiopulmonary bypass for
217 minutes, and was cross-clamped for 180 minutes.
Intraoperatively, it was found that the patient had
underlying block and was postoperatively AV paced.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the CSRU, and
remained intubated.  On postoperative day number one, the
patient was extubated and maintained a blood gas on CPAP of
7.43/41/77/28/2.  The patient's nitroprusside was weaned with
some slight hypertension.  The patient remained ventricular
paced at 70.  The patient was subsequently found to be
stable, with a blood pressure in the 120s and saturating at
98% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  The patient continued to be
ventricular paced, at which time EPS was consulted.  The
patient was also noted to have transient increase in his
creatinine at around 2.1, which plateaued at that number and
slowly declined to a final creatinine on discharge of 1.3.

In the interim, the Infectious Disease service, who had been
following the patient since his admission, cleared him to
have a permanent pacemaker placed, as the patient's blood
cultures had been negative up until that point.  A PICC line
was placed on the 18th in the right arm for long-term
intravenous oxacillin, which is to end [**2116-2-7**].

On [**2116-1-16**], a permanent pacemaker was placed, and
postoperatively he was placed on vancomycin for 48 hours.
Chest x-ray confirmed interval placement of a dual-chamber
pacemaker.  The pacemaker leads clearly terminated in the
right atrium and the right ventricle respectively.  The PICC
line was also readjusted at that point.

On [**2116-1-18**], postoperative day number eight, the patient was
found to be in stable condition status post a homograft
aortic valve replacement as well as a right ventricular
aortic abscess repair, as well as permanent pacemaker and a
PICC line.  He was discharged in good condition, and his
methadone dose had been tapered down to 5 mg by mouth once
daily for pain control.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg by mouth twice a day
2.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day
3.  Oxacillin 2 grams intravenously qh for three weeks
4.  Zantac 150 mg by mouth once daily
5.  Methadone 5 mg by mouth once daily

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Home.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**]
in four weeks.  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3640**] in
the Infectious Disease Clinic on [**2115-2-24**], at 9:30
A.M., and the patient is to follow up at the [**Hospital **] Clinic.
