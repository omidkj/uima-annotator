FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-3**], there is no

bifurcations and upper lung fibrosis with upward retraction of
the hila consistent with old granulomatous disease. No evidence
of acute focal pneumonia.

Chest X-ray: REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient
with respiratory failure. ([**10-8**])

Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2131-10-7**].
There are bibasal opacities, new bibasal opacities compared to
the chest
radiograph from [**10-6**]. The evaluation of the chest CT from

[**2131-10-6**] demonstrate already present minimal opacities
in the lower lobes compatible with multifocal pneumonia that
appears to be worsening on chest radiograph, consistent with
progression of the disease.
.
CTA Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Stable appearance of the AAA, incompletely assessed in the
current study.
3. Multifocal patchy opacities in the lower lobes, compatible
multifocal
pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  COPD Excaerbation:  Mr [**Known lastname 13621**] was admitted with worsening
respiratory distress suggestive of COPD flare.  He was
transferred from the floor to the ICU for worsening
desaturations which required intubation.  While in the ICU, he
was started on 125 mg IV solumedrol q8 daily for X 4 days.  He
was given ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers, and was started
on azithromycin.  While in the ICU, a CTA was done to rule out
pulmonary embolism, which was negative.  The CTA did reveal,
however, a superimposed multifocal pneumonia.  He was initially
started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin
and cefepime, but this coverage was narrowed once his sputum
grew out strep pneumococcus sensitive to levoquin.  He was
started on a levoquin course which he should continue for a
total of a 9 day course (can be stopped after [**10-15**]).  He
self-extubated in the ICU and thereafter had saturations between
95 - 100% on 3 L NC.  He was then transferred to the floor where
he was weaned down to room air with continued saturations
between 95 - 100%.  He was able to ambulate on room air without
desaturations.  He was discharged home with services, with a
plan to continue inhaled steroids and long acting B agonist
(advair) and tiotropium daily, with albuterol nebs as necessary.
 He was instructed to finish his steroid taper (got 4 days of IV
steroids, then 4 days of 60 mg of prednisone in the hospital.
At home, he will finish 3 days of 40 mg, and 3 days of 20 mg).
He will also finish 3 additional days of levaquin to finish a 9
day course. He was set up for follow up appointments with a
[**Hospital 1944**] clinic and pulmonary (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The
importance of compliance to both his medications and keeping his
appointments was emphasized.
.
2. Hyperlipidemia - was continued on lipitor
.
3. Gout - continued on allopurinol.
.
4. Osteoporosis - Continue vitamin D
.
5. Abdominal aortic aneurysm - Stable
.
6. Chronic back pain - continue percosets 1-2 tabs q8 as
necessary for pain
.
7. Disposition - To home with services; they will help instruct
him on use of nebulizers and inhaled steroids as above.
.
8. Hypophosphatemia - Found to be substantially hypophosphatemic
during this hospitalization and required phosphate repletion. He
will follow up in post discharge clinic for electrolyte check.
