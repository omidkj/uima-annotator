Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female who presented s/p PEA arrest.
.
Differential diagnosis of the patient's PEA arrest at
presentation included PE, stroke, cardiac causes, aspiration
PNA. Patient underwent cooling protocol upon presentation. She
was cooled using the Artic sun with goal of 32.5 degrees and
subsequently rewarmed. The patient was treated with levofloxacin
and flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia. ECHO demonstrated
RV dilatation suggestive of PE and the patient was started on
heparin drip. She underwent a 48 hour EEG done that demonstrated
activity consistent poor neurologic prognosis. They evaluated
the patient and stated that her inability to breath on her own
and absent corneal reflex were a poor prognostic sign. Spoke
extensively with grandson who agreed on DNR, and subsequently
made the patient comfort measures only.
.
The patient's date/time of death was [**2101-12-8**] at 2:35 PM. The
