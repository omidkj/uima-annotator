Echo:1. A patent foramen ovale is present.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (25%). Severe, global
hypokinesis to akinesis is present with some preservation of
basal wall motion, especially the basal lateral wall.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape
unavailable for review) of [**2164-8-3**], left ventricular systolic
function has deteriorated.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Cardiovascular:
a) Ischemia:
Cardiac catheterization revelaed LAD with subtotal occlusion and
70% occlusion at ostial D1.  2 cypher stents were placed in this
vessel.  He alos had 70% proximal occlusion of the LcX and 40%
RCA (no stents).  PCW was 30 with CO/CI of 3.4/1.8.  He was
started on integrillin post procedure and ASA, Plavix, ACEI, BB,
and statin.  He was chest pain free after procedure with
improvement in his EKG.   CK peak was 6831 with MB=13.4 and
tnt=21.0.  Fasting lipid profile was checked, and smoking
cessation was encouraged.

On [**4-17**] pt had chest pain similar to prior chest pain. He was
placed on nitro gtt.  His EKG unchanged. He went to cath which
showed patent LAD, and a jailed D2 which was ballooned opened
with kissing balloons. His old LCx lesion was also noted.

b) Pump:   On 2nd cath, his wedge was 11, CI >2.5, and had
normal filling pressures suggesting a significant improvement
from his inital right heart cath results.

c) Rhythm: He was monitored on telemetry post-MI.

2. Drug Rash:  He developed an urticarial rash 1 day after
admission and received 1 dose of steroids with multiple doses of
Benadryl.  Rash resolved after this treatment.  It was unclear
what the inciting medication was; it was most likely iodine
(from dye), for the rash was mostly in the groin area.

3.  Hyperlipidemia: He was started on Lipitor, and fasting lipid
profile was checked.

4.  Tobacco Use: Smoking cessation was encouraged in-house

5.  Disposition: to home with cardiac rehab in 2 weeks and he
will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
