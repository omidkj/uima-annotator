[**2101-10-26**] ECHO
PREBYPASS
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect or PFO is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 15 %). with moderate global hypokinesis.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. There is no pericardial effusion.
6. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2101-10-26**]

POSTBYPASS
1. Patient is on epinephrine, milrinone, and phenylephrine
infusions
2. Left ventricular function is marginally improved with an EF
20-25%. Global hypokinesis.
3. Mitral regurgitation remains mild to moderate.
4. Smooth ascending aortic contours after decannulation.
Descending aorta similar size to prebyass.
5. All findings communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of
CBP ending

Final Report
CHEST, PORTABLE AP

REASON FOR EXAM: 83-year-old man, status post CABG, status post
chest tube
removal. Rule out pneumothorax.

Since [**2101-10-26**], the patient was extubated, nasogastric
tube,
mediastinal drains, and left chest tube were removed. There is
no
pneumothorax.

Small right pleural effusion slightly increased. Left pleural
effusion is
still tiny. Left retrocardiac atelectasis increased. There is no
volume
overload.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79128**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2101-10-26**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken directly
to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to five vessels. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit on epinephrine, milrinone, and propofol drips. On
postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 79128**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact
and was extubated. he was transfused and amiodarone was started
for runs of V Tach. Over the next several days his iv drips were
 weaned off and on POD #5 he was transferred to the floor.
He did well, remained hemodynamically stable, his activity level
was advanced and on POD7 he was discharged home with visiting
nurses.
