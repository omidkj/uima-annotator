Chief Complaint:
hypotension and hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VATS

History of Present Illness:
52yo man with history of Rheumatoid arthritis on gold
injections, hepatitis C, and pulmonary fibrosis was trasferred
from [**Hospital6 204**] for worsening dyspnea/hypoxemia and
for potential lung biopsy. He was admitted there on [**2157-11-7**]
where he presented after one to two weeks of chills and low
grade fevers with progressive shortness of breath. This is in
the setting of previously asymptomatic chest CT findings dating
back to [**8-28**] with nodules, scarring, and chest/abdominal
lymphadenopathy. His initial ABG was 7.49/34/65/94% on 4L nc.
His CT chest demonstrated multiple abnormal findings with
evidence of bullous disease, honeycombing in the bases and a
mosaic pattern of interstitial infiltrates. He reportedly was
presented options of going for lung biopsy or having an empiric
course of corticosteroids at that time. He opted for empiric
steroid treatment.
.
His hospital course was notable for worsening dyspnea to the
point of not being able to speak in sentences and progressive
hypoxemia. He was admitted on room air, and steadily progressed
to 40% mask -> 100% NRB with oxygen saturation of 95%; ABG
demonstrated 7.53/27/65. Throughout his hospital course, he
remained afebrile. He was initially treated with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. This was later tapered down to only azithromycin.
Chest films did not show any evidence of focal consolidation.
Rather, they demonstrated bilateral ground glass opacities.
.
In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] respiratory status was monitored and intubated yesterday
for progressive hypoxia and in anticipation of VATS for lung
biopsy and bronch today. While in OR today developed increasing
hypoxia and difficulty oxygenating, Swan was attempted
unsuccessfully and Right IJ cordis was placed. Eventually thick
secretions were noted in ETT which was pulled and a LMA was
placed for airway support. He was then transferred to ICU for
further management. Here is ventilated on AC 600/30/10/100%FiO2.
Preliminary pathology on biopsy results is consistent with dense
fibrosis. He is currently on Propofol gtt and appears
comfortable.

Brief Hospital Course:
52yo man with history of RA, hepatitis C, and pulmonary fibrosis
of uncertain etiology admitted to MICU with progressive hypoxia
after VATS.  Progressive hypoxia secondary to pulmonary fibrosis
and worsening hypoxia despite maximum oxigenation.  Pt was
continued on supportive O2 ventilation with paralysis.
Complicating matters. patient with growing pneumothorax after
VATS requiring re-initiation of chest tube  to suction.  Biopsy
pathology demonstrated change consistent with organizing stage
of diffuse alveolar damage, possibly complicating a
bacterial/viral infection, over a background of chronic
interstitial lung disease.  In workup echo remarkable for right
to left interatrial shunt; which under consultation from
cardiology felt to be of little clinical significance as well as
Pt not being a candidate for closure.  Given patient's disease
process, only potential "cure" would be heart lung transplant
but patient a poor candidate, contributing to very poor
prognosis.  Family meeting held where goals of care were
discussed.  Pt made CMO and transplant service consulted for
possible candidancy.  Pt was taken off ventilatory support and
died shortly thereafter.  Patient subsequently taken to the OR
for organ harvest.
