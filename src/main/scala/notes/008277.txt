Chest Pain

TEE

History of Present Illness:
75 yo M w/ COPD, CRI transitioning to HD, mult CVA, ongoing EtOH
abuse, esophageal varices presents with 1 day history of CP.
The patient is a poor historian and most of the history was
obtained from his wife.  The pain is described as a substernal
pressure which radiates to the back.  The pain was not related
to activity and did not improve with rest.  It persisted from
early this am until he arrived in the ED and received nitro.  He
also had N/V, chills but no diaphoresis.  At this point in time
the patient is pain free.  His wife claimed the pain was
worsened with deep inspiration and he was coughing productive of
dark sputum.
.
Also the patient recently had an AV fistula placed in his L arm
for HD on [**2-11**].  He had cellulitis which was tx with oxacillin
[**Date range (1) **] and then augmentin since.  Wife tells that patient is
non compliant with meds despite her urging.
.
Patient denies LH, dizziness, changes in vision/hearing,
dysphagia, decreased appetite, SOB, abd pain, dysuria, blood in
sputum/urine/stool.  He continues to drink 10 drinks a day.  His
last drink was 1am night prior to admission.  Also has a chronic
cough.

CXR - RLL infiltrate
.
TEE- no dissection
.
CTA:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive
atelectasis.
3. Moderate- sized pericardial effusion.
4. Bilateral lower lobe opacities, which may represent infection
vs. aspiration pneumonia.
5. Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. These may be
reactive in nature.
.
CT abdomen
1. Very limited study. There is no evidence of dissection,
though it is not excluded given that no IV contrast was
administered.
2. Consolidation vs. atelectasis in the right lower lobe
posteriorly. Small pleural effusions bilaterally.
3. Irregular contour of the left kidney. This was noted on a
prior report, though the images are not available for direct
comparison. Etiology is not clear.
4. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease.
5. Small lymph nodes in the axilla and retroperitoneum that do
not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
6. L4 compression deformity. The acuity of this finding is not
clear, as the prior study images are not available for direct
comparison.
7. Sclerotic lesions within the pelvis as described. Correlation
with PSA requested.
.
TEE- no evidence of aortic dissection.
.
Video Swallow- Significantly delayed oral transit and pharyngeal
swallow initiation. Piecemeal bolus handling. Aspiration
observed with swallowing materials and thin liquid. Acute cough
was effective in clearing the aspirated material. For a more
detailed report, please refer to the speech pathology report.
.
TTE- 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium
is elongated.
2.The right atrium is markedly dilated.
3.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly
depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
apical distal
inferior, basal and mid inferolateral hypokinesis.
4. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis.
6. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.
9. There is an echogenic density in the right atrium consistent
with a
pacemaker lead.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo M w/ COPD, CRI transitioning to HD, mult CVA, ongoing EtOH
abuse, new dx of adenoca now txfx'd from the ICU following CHF
exacerbation.
Originally admitted w/ pna after being ruled out for MI, neg
CTA, hct drop during admission led to colonoscopy w/
polypectomy- one of which was positive for adenoca ([**Location (un) 6553**] B).
Neg liver u/s.  Course c/b by mult episodes of GIB, stable over
the last week.  During that time pt rec'd lg volume resusciation
after which he became increasingly SOB after diuresis held.
Transferred to ICU, underwent UF and HD w/ subsequent dramatic
improvement in resp status.
.
1) PNA- patient initially admitted with diagnosis of pneumonia.
Found to be requiring 3-4L O2 via NC to maintain oxygenation.
Given that patient originally presented with pleuritic chest
pain he underwent CTA to rule out PE, which was negative. TEE
was ordered from ED to r/o ao dissection.  Completed 7 day
course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin, w/ subjective
improvement and decreased O2 requirement.   Given intial
findings on CT felt that aspiration was possibly playing a role
in the patient's lung disease.  During transfer to ICU [**2-2**] resp
failure/CHF (see below) the patient was started on steroids for
presumed COPD contribution (although no PFTs ever performed by
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] previous O2 sat ever recorded in office, CT w/o bullae
or hyperinflation). He will complete the steroid taper tomorrow.
.
2) CHF- following volume resusciation for GIB (as discussed
below) the patient was noted to have continued 2L oxygen
requirement.  Pt had no h/o CHF but TTE showed mild systolic
dysfxn.  During week 3 of hospitalization the patient developed
increasing SOB.  The attending physician had asked that diuresis
be stopped as it was felt that the patient had a primary
pulmonary process.  In the interim, as  further w/u, BNP and
repeat CXR were obtained.  BNP returned elevated at 21K, w/
increasing vol  congestion on CXR.  The patient was developing
increasing SOB and was transferred to the ICU for emergent HD.
A Quintan catheter was placed and the patient underwent UF and
HD w/ subsequent resolution of his SOB.  On transfer back to the
floor the patient was oxygenting well on RA.  Plan to complete a
steroid taper, as above.
.
3) Adenocarcinoma of colon- during admission, pt developed
ongoing HCT drop w/ guiac positive stools.  Colonoscopy revealed
multiple polyps, 8 of which were removed.  The pathology on a
polyp removed from the transverse colon revealed adenocarcinoma
within several millimeters of the margin.  Followi
