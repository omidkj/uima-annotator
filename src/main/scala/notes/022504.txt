Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Rofecoxib

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12174**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis ([**6-6**] and 18, right and left side,
respectively)
Pericardial window ([**6-10**])
Intubation ([**6-9**])


History of Present Illness:
This is a 58-year-old male with with a history of liver-kidney
[**Month (only) **] in [**2124**] for chronic hepatitis C cirrhosis, HL, HTN,
emphysema, OSA, and A fib who presented with SOB,
lightheadedness, emesis, vague visual hallucinations, finger
twicthing, and arm weakness.  For the last few days prior to
admission, patient reports the following symptoms: dizziness,
dropping things due to twitching in both hands, decrease
inappetite, decrease fluid intake, more concentrated urine
output, mild dull headache, blurry vision, and soreness in the
lungs when taking deep breaths.  He reports for the last several
months he's had SOB when walking even a half block.  He needs to
stop and rest to catch his breath.  Twice in the last two days
he's continued to walk despite the SOB and had visual
hallucinations (one of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] that was not there and one of a
dog that was not there).

On arrival to the ED VS were T 96.8 BP 84/48 HR 55 RR 16 02 sat
97% on 3L.  While in the ED BP dropped to 71/40 with improvement
of SBP to the low 100s after IVF. He had a total of 3L of NS in
the ED.  His neuro exam was non-focal in the ED and CT of the
head was negative.  A CT abdomen and pelvis was notable for a
moderate pericardial effusion, pulsus was 4, and echo showed no
evidence of tamponade.  A CXR had some questionable haziness and
patient given zosyn 4.6g IV x1 and vancomycin 1g IV x1.  Two
peripheral IVs were placed.  Creatinine was notably 4.5 (up from
1.5) and UA was negative.  Nephrology [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] was consulted
and requested a tacrolimus trough and urine lytes.  Hepatatology
and [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] surgery were made aware of the admission.  Vitals
prior to transfer were: 57 104/57 RR14 96% on 3L.

Review of systems:
Pertinent negative include: no new tingling, no slurring of
speech, no one sided weakness in the legs (felt more weak
recently), no dysuria, no hematuria,
(+) Per HPI, + dull mild headache, + chronic occasional
diarrhea, + chronic hip pain

constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies
dysuria, frequency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias except per
HPI. Denies rashes or skin changes.

Radiology:

Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2132-6-16**]):
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a small-moderate circumferential pericardial effusion. The
effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or
other cellular elementswith nearly no free flowing elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-6-13**], the findings are
similar.

Unilateral upper extremity doppler ultrasound ([**2132-6-16**]):
Echogenic linear structure, the appearance of which is
suggestive of a foreign body or less likely a retracted clot
within the right basilic  vein in the right upper arm. Further
imaging with plain film radiograph is suggested.

X-ray, right upper extremity ([**2132-6-17**]):
Unremarkable appearance of the right elbow. Vascular
calcification.

CXR ([**2132-6-18**] --> at discharged):
A left subclavian line tip is at the junction of the
brachiocephalic vein and SVC. The two endovascular stents: SVC
and right subclavian vein catheter are in place.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. There is
still present left small-to-moderately and right small pleural
effusion that appears to be improved compared to [**2132-6-15**].
There is also some improvement in the bibasilar aeration, in
particular in the left lower lung. Compared to the study from
the beginning of [**Month (only) **] ([**6-3**] or [**6-5**] for example), cardiac
silhouette appears to be decreased most likely due to at least
partial resolution of pericardial effusion. There is no
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2198**] is a very nice 58-year-old gentleman admitted with
SOB, lightheadedness, emesis, and vague visual hallucinations,
found to be hypotensive, in acute renal failure, and with
pericardial and bilateral pleural effusions.
