HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 28181**] is a 53 year-old
female who is status post cadaveric renal transplantation in
[**2161-8-3**] for end stage renal disease and polycystic
kidney disease who had an uneventful postoperative course,
but developed increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on
exertion with abrupt worsening at the end of [**2161-12-3**].
She also expressed concern about weight gain and pedal edema.
She was eventually diuresed at outside hospital, but was
found to have elevated creatinine and was subsequently
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
management.  At the tine of transfer the patient's creatinine
was elevated at 3.0.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Polycystic kidney disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco use and states
that she uses alcohol occasionally.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature 98.8.  Blood
pressure 122/64.  Heart rate 94.  Oxygen saturation 95% on 3
liters nasal cannula.  In general, the patient is an obese
African American female who appears to be in mild distress.
HEENT clear oropharynx.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Neck
supple, nontender without lymphadenopathy.  Heart regular
rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  Lungs decreased at the
bilateral bases.  Abdomen soft, obese, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities 2+ pedal edema bilaterally.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  White blood cell count 4.5, hematocrit
27.2, platelet count 276, PT 13.6, PTT 30.6, INR 1.2, sodium
140, potassium 5.5, chloride 103, bicarb 27, BUN 31,
creatinine 3.1, glucose 223, AST 23, ALT 11, alkaline
phosphatase 93, amylase 49, total bilirubin 0.2, lipase 30.

IMAGING:  Chest x-ray performed on admission demonstrated a
globular appearing cardiac silhouette with small bilateral
effusions and an overall picture concerning for pericardial
effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After the patient was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 69**] on [**2162-1-4**] a
pericardial drain was placed to treated the pericardial
effusion.  This drained approximately 1 liter in the
immediate period and she therefore underwent a pericardial
window procedure on [**2162-1-8**] for persistent fluid
reaccumulation.  The patient tolerated this procedure well
and was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit postoperatively
for close observation.  She was extubated on postoperative
day one with two chest tubes in place and was transferred to
the [**Hospital3 **] floor on postoperative day two in stable
condition.  The patient did well, but developed a temperature
spike on postoperative day six along with increased shortness
of breath.  A chest x-ray at this time demonstrated
hydropneumothorax.  This was treated without intervention and
subsequently resolved.  The patient did have another
temperature spike to 103.6 and was subsequently found to have
MRSA bacteremia.  This was treated with intravenous
Vancomycin.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was done to
evaluate the heart valve given the recent procedure and
persistent bacteremia.  This finding was consistent with
endocarditis.  The infectious disease team was therefore
consulted for management.  Per their recommendations, the
patient was treated with Levofloxacin for gram negative
coverage along with Vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia and
presumed endocarditis.  She was also on Valcyte for a
positive CMV antibody titer.

Around this time the patient developed severe right hip pain
permitting her from ambulating.  An MRI was performed, which
was negative for infection, but did show mild degenerative
joint disease.  The patient was focally tender over the
greater trochanter area and an orthopedic consultation was
therefore obtained for possible trochanteric bursitis.  Per
their recommendations given that the patient was already on
steroids they felt that it would be unuseful to treat her
with additional steroid medications as it might potentiate
her dependence on steroids.  The patient was therefore
treated with aggressive physical therapy and was seen by the
acute pain service.  An MRI was obtained to rule out
radiculopathy, which was negative.  She was treated with
Tylenol #3 with Percocet for breakthrough pain and is
scheduled to see the pain service as an outpatient.  During
her hospitalization, a biopsy of the transplant kidney was
performed, which was negative for rejection.  After remaining
afebrile for greater then 48 hours the patient was discharged
to rehab for physical therapy and intravenous antibiotics.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient was instructed to follow up
with the [**Hospital 1326**] Clinic in approximately one week.  She
should have a CBC, chem 7, calcium, magnesium, phosphate,
albumin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, T bilirubin, D
bilirubin, and FK506 levels drawn every Monday and Thursday
in the morning while at rehab.  These results can be faxed to
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 697**] for dosing changes.  The patient was instructed
to follow up with the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1193**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1194**] Service at the [**Hospital1 346**] as needed for her right hip pain.
The patient was also instructed to follow up if she had
fevers greater then 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, intractable
vomiting or any other questions or concerns.
