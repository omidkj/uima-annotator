Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with multiple medical problems including long
standing metastatic breast cancer, severe pulmonary
hypertension, emphysema, atrial fibrillation, presenting with
worsened hypoxia and chest pain, with minimal ST changes, and
negative cardiac enzymes.
.
# ANGINA: Given patients severely limited functional status, it
was difficult to assess whether her symptoms were caued by
unstable angina vs stable angina.  ST elevations were not
significantly different from baseline.  However there were new
ST segment depressions compared to prior.  Cardiac enzymes were
negative X 3.  Heparin was not initiated given INR
supratherapeutic on presentation. Given low prob of ACS,
atorvastatin was continued at home dose.  Per cardiology, pt was
considered to be a high risk candidate for catheterization and
unlikely to benefit from intervention, presently and in the
future. Pt had no further episodes of chest pain or acute
dyspnea. Double product control will be important going forward.
 Metoprolol decreased due to bradycardia.  Her nifedipine was
held initially due to concern about renal toxicity and low blood
pressures.  It was not restarted prior to discharge, but may
need to be restarted as an outpatient.
.
#. BRADYCARDIA: Bradycardia was thought to be due to medication
effect.  HR improved to low 70s off of nodal agents.  Metoprolol
intially held and restarted at a lower dose and converted to
sustained release.  On discharge, her heart rate was
consistently in the 55-60 range.

#. ACUTE SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Patient was grossly volume
overloaded on admission.  Per report, pt's medications are
provided by her care givers.  She did not respond to bolus of IV
80mg and started on a Lasix drip with diuresis of 1.5-2L daily.
Her volume status improved as did her oxygen requirement.  On
discharge, her home lasix dose was increased.  Her daughter
notes that the patient does not seem to repond well to lasix
anymore.  She may benefit from metolazone or another diuretic
therapy in the future.

#. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Given volume overload suspect poor
forward flow from CHF is most likely etiology.  Pt was diuresed
and her renal function improved to near baseline and should be
rechecked as an outpatient.  Her valsartan was held in the acute
setting, but restarted prior to discharge.

# HYPOXIA: Multifactorial in setting of pulm hypertension,
volume overload with pulmonary edema, and emphysema.  There was
some question of RLL on Xray with no clinical correlation.  She
was intially started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin which was
discontinued given improvement in CXR and O2 requirement with
diuresis.  She was continued on levoquin for treatment of her
lacrimal duct abscess.  Patient finished her course of levoquin
prior to discharge.

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Well rate controlled.  Pt was admitted
with supratherapuetic INR.  Coumadin held until INR reached
goal.  Restarted at lower dose prior to discharge.  Will need
INR checked in follow up.

# BREAST CANCER: Pt was continued on Femara.  She should discuss
need to continue this medicatin with her primary oncologist.
.
# CODE: FULL, confirmed with patient and daughter.  However,
both the daughter and the patient wished to discuss this issue
further with the patient's PCP who was not available during this
hospitalization.
