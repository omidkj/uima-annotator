Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8104**]
Chief Complaint:
L hemiplegia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation in the ED for airway protection.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 79 yo woman with PMH including HTN,
hypercholesterolemia and remote hx of cervical cancer who has
not seen her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 2 years was found unresponsive in her bed.
 She lives in an [**Hospital3 **] facility ([**Hospital1 **] House of
[**Location (un) **], MA) and was last seen 48 hrs prior without any obvious
signs of distress.

Staff found her supine in her bed - she was mute with right
sided gaze and not moving her left side.  EMS was called and she
had normal initial vitals including BP, HR and FSBG.  EMS found
her with facial droop and somnolent but was able to nod for
answers and denied HA.

Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], she was "awake and nodding" but was
intubated prior to CT for airway protection in the ED.  She was
then admitted to Neuro ICU service.


Past Medical History:
Last saw PCP (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1528**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) in [**4-3**]; refused most of
screenings including mammograms and colonoscopy plus all
vaccinations.
1. HTN
2. Hypercholesterolemia
3. Sciatica
4. Hx of cervical cancer s/p resection and radiation therapy in
[**2111**]
5. Carpal tunnel syndrome
6. hx of syncope x2 - most recent in [**4-3**] --> normal stress test
(MIBI)


Social History:
Lives in ALF ([**Hospital1 **] House) - was homeless in the remote past
per PCP.  [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] 2~3 cigarettes/day and no EtOH hx. Raised her
grandchildren. Has [**Name Initial (NameIs) 802**] named [**Name (NI) 32400**] who was made her
guardian/HCP during this admission.

Pertinent Results:
Microbiology:
all blood cx's: negative for growth
urine cx: [**9-4**] - pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 36**] to cipro and zosyn.
sputum cx: mssa and proteus mirabilis [**Last Name (un) 36**] to ceftriaxone
c. diff: negative ([**9-5**])

EKG: Normal sinus rhythm with atrial premature complexes.
Intra-atrial conduction defect. Left ventricular hypertrophy
with secondary repolarization abnormalities. Axis is plus 60
degrees suggesting a co-existent pulmonary or right ventricular
disease. Since the previous tracing of [**2133-3-16**] diffuse ST-T wave
changes and left ventricular hypertrophy are more prominent and
axis has shifted rightward.

Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
seen by 2D/color Doppler (cannot definitively exclude). There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. No vegetation seen (cannot definitively
exclude).

MRI/MRA:
MRI IMPRESSION:
1. Acute right-sided corona radiata and periventricular infarct
with acute
wallerian degeneration extending to the right side of the
midbrain.
2. Chronic multiple lacunes in the basal ganglia and small
vessel disease.
3. Multiple microhemorrhages in the brain, suspicious for
amyloid angiopathy.

MRA IMPRESSION:
1. Diminished flow signal in the anterior circulation could be
secondary to slow flow.
2. Non-visualization of the distal vertebral and proximal
two-third of the
basilar artery could be due to occlusion or slow flow from
high-grade
stenosis.

EEG: Abnormal EEG to slow background with occasional suppressive

bursts. These findings suggest a widespread encephalopathy
affecting
both cortical and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic

disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
Hypoxia
is another possible explanation. Conceivably, this pattern could
also
be seen in a prolonged post-ictal state. Nevertheless, there
were no
areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathies can
obscure
focal findings. There were no clearly epileptiform features.

L ANKLE: Multiple vascular calcifications in the soft tissues.
Duct-like
calcifications projecting over the ventral frontal parts of the
talus. There is an obliquely oriented lateral fracture of the
malleolus, with only minimal displacement. A small fragment of
bone seen along the medial aspect of the distal fibular
represent a comminuted fragment. There is no other evidence of
post-traumatic disease. Small plantar spur.

Carotid U/S:
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries.
There is heterogeneous plaque in the proximal ICA and distal CCA
bilaterally.  There is plaque in the proximal right ECA. On the
right, peak velocities are 86, 97 and 66 cm/sec in the ICA, CCA
and ECA
respectively. This is consistent with less than 40% stenosis. On
the left, peak velocities are 104, 95 and 112 cm/sec in the ICA,
CCA and
ECA respectively. This is consistent with less than 40%
stenosis.
There is antegrade vertebral flow bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.

Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite new abnormalities. Cortical hypodensity in the
frontal lobes is likely related to beam-hardening artifact.
However, subtle cytotoxic edema cannot be excluded. MRI is
suggested for further evaluation. This was discussed with the
ordering physician by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21881**] when the study was
obtained.
2. The acute infarction in the right lentiform nucleus and
corona radiata is unchanged, allowing for differences in
modalities.
3. Unchanged chronic infarction in the left lentiform nucleus
and internal
capsule.

CXR: ([**8-31**])
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe consolidation with small pleural
effusion is very worrisome for aspiration, a component of
atelectasis/collapse is suspected.. could be due to a mucous
plug. Dobhoff tube was pulled back, now ends in the stomach. CXR
taken on [**9-1**] and [**9-2**] remained unchanged.

Labs:
CBC - Hct 48 on admission, nadirs to low 20s on [**8-29**] and
[**Date range (1) 8967**] requiring blood transfusions. WBC peak to 16.0 on
[**8-31**], which decreased to 8s with initiation of antibiotics on
[**9-2**] and was 7.7 on discharge.

Chem-10: Cre stable at 0.4 throughout admission. Na briefly low
to 130s, resolved w/ decreasing free H20 boluses. K 3.5-4.0
