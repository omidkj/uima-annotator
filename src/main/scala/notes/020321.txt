Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1136**]
Chief Complaint:
Hematuria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
79M with severe AS, metastatic prostate cancer with recent
pseudomonal UTI, hydronephrosis s/p bilateral stent placement
last month, presenting with hematuria and found to be
hypotensive. He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 79432**]
with ARF and new hydronephrosis/hydroureter requiring urologic
stent placement. Pseudomonal UTI diagnosed at that admission and
has been on cipro since. Also was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] given worsening
AS to see if candidate for valvuloplasty, but appears to have
been medically managed (full details/dc summary not available).
His diuretics were changed from lasix to torsemide 30 mg daily.
Since this admission he has been watching his fluid intake and
has actually lost weight (7#) in addition to noting improvement
in leg edema. He thinks his doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] have further decreased
torsemide down to 20 mg daily but is unsure. No dyspnea/CP/PND.

.
He had mild but continued gross hematuria at time of discharge.
This became sigificantly worse about 3 days ago and was
associated with urinary frequency (voiding hourly) and feeling
of distension and spasm. His hematocrit was also found to be low
and he received 2 units of PRBCs - one yesterday and one the day
prior. Per his family since the procedure he has had blood
pressures in the 90's-100's. Given the hematuria and anemia,
asked to come to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.9 67 115/48 18 100 on RA. He
was evaluated by urology who placed a foley catheter and
performed continuous bladder irrigation. He had some small
clots. He was going to the floor, but developed intermittent
episodes of hypotension to the high 80's. This was responsive to
a fluid bolus. He received a total of 2 L of NS. His hematocrit
decreased from 31.5 to 29.3 over 5 hours in the ED (received
fluids). Vitals on transfer: 72 95/41 16 97 RA. He had one
peripheral and was going to get another prior to transfer.
.
On the floor, patient reports feeling well, no complaints.
.
Review of sytems:

cough, shortness of breath since discharge. No change in
orthopnea. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, recent change in bowel or bladder
habits. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension; Compared with the prior

Brief Hospital Course:
79M with metastatic prostate cancer, hydronephrosis s/p recent
urologic stenting, recent pseudomonal UTI, and severe aortic
stenosis was admtited with hematuria and hypotension. Due to his
hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 80s, he was
initially admitted to the ICU and then transferred to the
medical floor.

1. Hypotension.
Upon arrival in the ICU, the differential diagnosis for his
hypotension was broad, including infection, volume depletion,
and adrenal insufficiency. He was started initially on broad
spectrum antibiotics for coverage of urinary pathogens, fluid
resuscitation, and stress dose steroids for adrenal
insufficiency. His cultures were no growth to date x 72 hours
and antibiotics were discontinued. His hypotension was
ultimately thought most likely related to volume depletion in
light of aggressive diuresis and hematuria. His hypotension
resolved as his hematuria improved. Upon discharge, his systolic
blood pressures ranged from 110-130. His flomax was held during
this admission due to his hypotension.

2. Hematuria.
Etiology was thought most likely related to radiation cystitis.
Urine cultures were negative. He initially required continuous
bladder irrigation. As his hematuria improved, continuous
bladder irrigation was discontinued and the patient was able to
void independently. He was discharged with urology follow-up
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**]. His aspirin was held during this
admission, and he was recommended to follow-up with his PCP
regarding restarting this medication.

3. Acute Renal Failure.
He had an acute elevation in his creatinine. This was thought to
be mainly prerenal. A renal ultrasound did not show any evidence
of obstruction. His creatinine steadily improved during his
admission.

4. Metastatic prostate cancer.
He was continued on ketoconazole and hydrocortisone. He was
initially on stress dose steroids for treatment of adrenal
insufficiency as a cause of his hypotension. Adrenal
insufficiency appeared less likely and his steroids were rapidly
tapered to his home regimen.

5. Recent pseudomonal UTI.
After discussion with urology, his cipro was discontinued.
