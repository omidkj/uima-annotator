HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 46-year-old woman with a
history of asthma, status post multiple intubations and
tracheostomy in [**2099**], OSA, CAD, type 2 diabetes mellitus who
presents with 2 days of progressive shortness of breath. The
patient was admitted on [**2103-1-27**] through [**2-7**]; during which she was intubated for hypercarbic
respiratory failure. During that admission she received
steroids, albuterol, and Atrovent with improvement allowing
extubation and transfer to the floor. However, her
respiratory status again worsened and she was readmitted to
the MICU for BiPAP. She was also noted to have several
episodes of laryngeal spasm management with inhalers, racemic
epinephrine, and inhaled Ativan. An airway CT showed tracheal
narrowing 10 mm to 4 mm with exhalation. IP did a rigid
bronchoscopy which showed a large amount of granulation
tissue in the trachea. The patient refused the plan to take
her to the OR for debridement of the granulation tissue and
possible airway stent placement and was discharged on a
prednisone taper, to follow up with her PCP.

The patient reports that she has noticed worsening of her
baseline dyspnea over the past 2 days, improved with
inhalers. She reports that a relative has recently been ill
with an upper respiratory infection, but denies a personal
history of cough, sputum production, fevers, chills,
myalgias, chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain. History is limited secondary to a
decrease in the patient's mental status, despite the use of
an interpreter.

In the ED, her temperature was 99.1, heart rate was 107,
blood pressure was 126/64, breathing 15 times a minute, and
saturating 75% on room air. She received Solu-Medrol 125 mg
IV x 1 and Combivent nebulizers x 3. She was placed on BiPAP
at her home settings of 15 and 5. About 1 hour after
placement of BiPAP, ABG was 7.18/136/113. She was given a
chest x-ray which showed prominent hilar vasculature, and the
patient was treated with Lasix 20 mg IV for suspected CHF.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Asthma, status post multiple intubations and tracheostomy
   in [**2099**].
2. OSA, on BiPAP 15 and 5 at night.
3. Tracheal stenosis; discovered by airway CT on [**2103-2-1**]; findings consistent with focal tracheal stenosis
   with a component of malacia associated with disruption of
   tracheal cartilage.
4. Diastolic congestive heart failure.
5. CAD; EF of 65% with a small inferolateral wall reversible
   defect per Persantine MIBI in [**2099-12-17**].
6. Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
7. Vitamin B12 deficiency.
8. Status post appendectomy.
9. Lumbar DJD.
10.      Psychotic disorder not otherwise specified.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature of 98, pulse
of 118, blood pressure of 165/100, respiratory rate of 24,
and O2 saturation of 99% on BiPAP (15 and 5). In general, an
obese middle-aged Spanish-speaking woman who was speaking in
short sentences. BiPAP in place. Moderate respiratory
distress. HEENT revealed anicteric. Pupils were equal and
minimally reactive to light. Normal conjunctivae. BiPAP in
place. Oral mucous membranes dry. The oropharynx was clear.
The neck was supple. No lymphadenopathy. No JVD. Cardiac
revealed regular S1 and S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Pulmonary with decreased breath sounds throughout with
occasional wheezes. The abdomen with positive bowel sounds.
Soft, nontender, and nondistended. Extremities were warm.
Dorsalis pedis pulses of 2+ bilaterally. No edema. Neurologic
limited by patient cooperation. Positive coarse tremor. Moved
all four extremities equally. Sensation grossly intact
proximally and distally in the upper and lower extremities
bilaterally.

PERTINENT RESULTS:  EKG: sinus tachycardia at 109 beats per
minute, normal intervals, T wave inversion in aVL, Q wave in
lead III. No significant change since [**2103-1-27**].

A chest x-ray: bilateral increased hilar vascularity with in
infiltrates.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. ASTHMA EXACERBATION: The patient was admitted with
   dyspnea, hypercarbia, and hypoxia secondary to an asthma
   exacerbation. There was no evidence of precipitating
   event. There was no evidence of pneumonia. Flu DFA was
   negative, and the patient ruled out for MI by cardiac
   enzymes and normal EKG. She was initially admitted to the
   MICU and maintained on BiPAP resulting in good oxygenation
   and ventilation. She was also treated with albuterol and
   Atrovent aerosols and a steroid taper, beginning with Solu-
   Medrol and tapering to prednisone over her hospital
   course. Her dyspnea showed important over her 3 days in
   the MICU such that she was called out to the medicine
   floor for ongoing care.

On the medicine floor, she appeared to be at her baseline
respiratory status. She was treated with a 5-day course of
azithromycin, which she completed before her discharge from
the hospital. At discharge, the patient appeared to be at her
baseline respiratory status with no acute dyspnea. She was to
continue Atrovent and albuterol aerosols and was to continue
a prednisone taper over a period of 2 weeks after discharge.

1. TRACHEAL OBSTRUCTION: The patient had a known tracheal
   obstruction on admission that was discussed on airway CT.
   She had previously refused operative intervention, but
   agreed to further investigation on this admission. She
   underwent a rigid bronchoscopy on [**2103-3-15**] that
   demonstrated 70% tracheal obstruction secondary to
   granulation tissue that had presumably resulted from prior
   tracheostomy. During her rigid bronchoscopy, the
   obstructing granulation tissue was dilated resulting in
   decreased tracheal obstruction and good airflow. It is
   suspected that the dilatation will allow stabilization of
   the patient's acute illness and weaning of her steroid
   taper before her obstruction can be definitively treated
   with surgery in 1 to 2 months after discharge. At
   discharge, there was no evidence of stridor or
   complication of airway obstruction. The patient was
   discharged with instructions to follow up in the
   Interventional Pulmonary Clinic to assess the timing of
   surgical intervention.

1. DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2: The patient was initially
   treated with an insulin drip while in the MICU for tight
   glucose control. When she was called out to the medicine
   floor, she was started on her home regimen of Glargine
   insulin and covered with a Humalog insulin sliding scale
   with good affect.

1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: The patient had no EKG changes on
   admission, and ruled out for a MI by normal cardiac
   enzymes. However, given report of minor reversible defect
   on prior Persantine MIBI and the need for clearance for
   upcoming surgery the patient underwent a Persantine MIBI
   on [**2103-3-19**] that demonstrated normal cardiac
   perfusion with no reversible perfusion defects. During her
   admission, treatment was continued with the patient's
   outpatient doses of aspirin, Lipitor, captopril, and
   Lopressor.

1. HYPERTENSION: Controlled during admission with outpatient
   dose of captopril.

1. SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER: The medical team contact[**Name (NI) **] the
   patient's psychiatric case worker during this admission
   and clarified that the patient suffers schizoaffective
   disorder. The patient was intermittently agitated over
   this admission with occasional myoclonic jerks that were a
   baseline symptom, according to her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was treated
   with her outpatient dose of Paxil with good affect, and
   Zyprexa was used intermittently for acute agitation.

1. CODE STATUS: Full code during this admission.
