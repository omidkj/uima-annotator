Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, SOB, nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
percutaneous angioplasty PL branch of RCA

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 51yoM with h/o HIV/AIDS (in [**7-/2136**], CD4 582, HIV
VL non-detectable), pulmonary HTN (on sildenafil), HCV, who
presents with chest pain and STEMI in distal RCA. He initially
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with 3 hours of severe ([**9-12**])substernal
burning chest pain/pressure radiating to his left arm.
Associated with nausea and shortness of breath. No pleuritic
component. No recent fevers, chills, or cough. Unable to
describe whether it is exertional because he has not really
exerted himself during the symptoms. The patient had gotten up
early in the morning and gone to church then participated in
church activities.  He put his feet up when he got home and
began to experience the chest pain. No prior similar episodes.
No syncope or dizziness. No focal weakness, numbness, or
tingling. No recent catheterization or a stress test. He did
have a cardiac cath in [**2129**], that showed disease in LMCA and
LAD, but none in RCA.

TTE:
[**2136-11-19**]
The left atrium is mildly elongated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

CARDIAC CATH:
[**2136-11-18**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel coronray disease. The LMCA had 40%
distal
stenosis. The LAD had 40% mid-vessel stenosis. The LCx had 60%
mid and 60% distal stenosis. The RCA had 50% mid-vessel
stenosis, 50% PDA
stenosis and 100% occlusion of the posterolateral branch.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normotension.
3. Perfusion of a small RPL branch successfully treated by PTCA
with 2.25 mm balloons.
Diagnosis: 3 vessel cardiac disease
.
[**2129-8-3**]
1.  Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right-dominant

circulation with mild coronary artery disease.  LMCA had a
distal 40%
stenosis.  LAD had a proximal 50% stenosis.  LCx was diminutive,
and had no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.
RCA was a large, dominant vessel without
angiographically-apparent stenoses.
2.  Left ventriculography demonstrated no significant mitral
regurgitation, normal wall motion and EF of 60%.
3.  Resting hemodynamics with patient breathing ambient air
demonstrated severe pulmonary hypertension (mean PA 51 mmHg).
Right-
and left-sided filling pressures were normal (mean RAP 3 mmHg,
RVEDP 7 mmHg, mean PCWP 3 mmHg).  Cardiac output at baseline was
3.9 L/min with cardiac index of 1.9 L/min/m2.  Baseline PVR was
calculated to be 2106 dynes-sec/cm5.  After 15 minutes with
patient breathing 100% oxygen via a face mask, repeat
hemodynamics demonstrated no significant change in pulmonary
pressure.  Cardiac output increased to 5.1 L/min, and calculated
PVR decreased to 1286 dynes-sec/cm5.  After 15 minutes with
patient breathing nitric oxide at 40 ppm, repeat hemodynamics
demonstrated minimal reduction in pulmonary pressures (mean PA
45 mmHg), but no further increase in cardiac output, or decrease
in PVR beyond what was seen with 100% oxygen.
