CHEST (PORTABLE AP)[**2160-1-13**] IMPRESSION: Despite pulmonary
hyperinflation suggesting a substantial COPD, pulmonary
vasculature is engorged, suggesting that mild interstitial
abnormality is edema due to cardiac decompensation. Nevertheless
heart size is normal and mediastinal veins are not engorged.
Thoracic aorta is tortuous but not dilated. No appreciable
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW [**2160-1-16**] : Swallowing
videofluoroscopy was performed in conjunction with the speech
and swallow division. Multiple consistencies of barium were
administered. No gross aspiration was seen, however, penetration
was noted with thin liquids.  The patient was observed to be
coughing during the exam and was likely secondary to her COPD,
not aspiration. Slightly delayed bolus transfer. A severe amount
of residue was seen with all consistencies. A cricopharyngeal
bar is noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
74 year old female with a history of severe, Gold IV COPD who
presented with dyspnea, wheezing, and cough.

#COPD Exacerbation: Pt admitted to the MICU and started on
solumedrol 125mg q8 hours for HD1. Also started on q1 hour
duonebs, five day course of azithromycin. Nasopharyngeal viral
screen and sputum cultures sent. Droplet precautions maintained.
On HD2 she improved clinically to some degree though continued
to wheeze. Nebs changed to alternating albuterol and ipratropium
every 2 hours. Solumedrol discontinued and prednisone 40mg daily
started orally. Patient found to have RSV and ID was consulted
for possible treatment. Supportive care was recommended. In
discussion with infection control, patient did not require
respiratory precautions as she is not chronically
immunocompromised. As patient's breathing improved, she was
transferred to the floor unit. Nebulized treatment were
continued every four hours except during the night. Prednisone
was decreased to 30mg after 5 days.  Patients breathing
continued to improve, but required persistent oxygen at 2L to
keep saturations above 90%. She will taper steroid dose by 5 mg
every four days until reaching a dose of 15 mg/day then contact
her pulmonologist for further instructions.  Patient was
discharged to an extended care facility, Pleasant Bay, to
continue physical therapy.

# Dysphagia: Patient had a video swallow evaluation that showed
severe limitation on swallowing due to cricopharyngeal
narrowing. Patient was evaluated by ENT team and recommended
further procedures such as a balloon dilation or Botox
injections, but it is reasonable to wait after recovery from
this exacerbation.
.
#S/P TIA: Dialy Aspirin was continued
.
#GERD: omeprazole was continued

Transitional Issues:
-She will contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] when she reaches a dose of
15mg/day of prednisone to discuss further titrating down the
dose

-She will follow up with ENT for further management and possible
procedures for her dysphagia and cricopharyngeal myositis
