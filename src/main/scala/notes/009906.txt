away. However, he continued to notice small amounts of BRB
whenever he stood or went to the bathroom, therefore he came to

[**7-16**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 75. Left
axis deviation. Borderline intraventricular conduction delay.
Possible old anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Non-specific
lateral repolarization changes. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2142-6-27**] no significant change.

Radiology
[**7-16**] CXR: Compared with [**2142-6-19**], as well as to the chest CT of
[**2142-6-5**], the bilateral upper lobe infiltrates have cleared. The
right hemidiaphragm remains elevated, but in addition to
associated atelectasis at the right base, air bronchograms are
now seen consistent with right lower lobe
collapse/consolidation/aspiration. The remainder of the lung
fields appear clear.

[**7-18**] CXR PA/lat: There is likely no significant change from the
prior semi-upright radiograph performed at the bedside. The
heart size is probably normal. Mediastinal contours are within
normal limits. There is elevation of the right anterior
hemidiaphragm, with associated subsegmental atelectasis of the
right base. I doubt the presence of a consolidation. There is no
overt congestive failure. The left lung is well aerated. No
definite effusion. No pneumothorax. Coarse calcifications of the
carotid are noted on the left. A vague density overlying the
soft tissues of the right neck is new and likely external to the
patient.

IMPRESSION: No short interval change in right subsegmental
atelectasis. No definite pneumonia.

[**7-18**] right LENI: No right lower extremity DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 year old male w/ h/o CAD (NSTEMI [**5-/2142**]) on Plavix/ASA, AF on
Coumadin, and h/o radiation proctitis and diverticulosis
initially admitted to ICU [**7-16**] with BRBPR

1) Rectal bleeding/acute blood loss anemia: This was most likely
due to radiation proctitis in the setting of
ASA/Plavix/Coumadin. The patient was admitted to the ICU,
continued on ASA/Plavix, although Coumadin was held. His INR was
reversed with FFP, and he received 4 units of PRBC for a nadir
HCT of 25 (the last transfusion [**7-17**]). He underwent a
colonoscopy [**7-17**] which showed diverticulosis, rectal
angioectasias with friable rectal mucosa), and grade 1 internal
hemorrhoids. An Argon-Plasma Coagulator was applied to the
angioectasias successfully. He was transferred to the general
medical floor, where he remained hemodynamically stable with a
stable HCT (31 at time of discharge). He was continue on iron
supplementation; his vitamin B12 and folate levels were normal.

2) Right lower lobe atelectasis: The patient's initial CXR
raised concern for RLL pneumonia; repeat PA/lateral revealed
elevated right hemidiaphragm with associated atelectasis. Given
the absence of fever, leukocytosis, or cough, pneumonia was felt
to be unlikely.

3) h/o CHF (systolic): EF 35%, 2+ MR. The patient was diuresed
in the ICU following transfusion and, by the time of transfer to
the general medical floor, he was euvolemic.

4) CAD s/p recent NSTEMI with bare metal stent: The patient was
continued on aspirin, Plavix, statin. His metoprolol was
restarted once he hemodynamically stabilized. The patient will
follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.

5) Atrial fibrillation: As mentioned above, the patient's
Coumadin was held given rectal bleeding. He remained
well-rate-controlled on metoprolol. He will follow-up with his
cardiologist within 1-2 weeks following discharge; if his HCT
remains stable, warfarin will be started at the discretion of
his cardiologist.

6) Chronic kidney disease: The patient was followed by the renal
service during his admission. He will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4883**] as an outpatient to discuss initiating peritoneal
dialysis. His creatinine remained stable and he was continued on
Renagel and PhosLo.

7) Type II DM well-controlled w/ complications: The patient was
discharged on his home dose of NPH/RI

8) HTN: By the time of discharge, the patient had been restarted
on his home doses of Cardizem/metoprolol
