ADDENDUM:  The patient was to be discharged on [**11-25**] to
[**Hospital3 **].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  As per previous dictation.

HOSPITAL COURSE (CONTINUED):  The patient was kept in the
Intensive Care Unit pending bed availability at the
rehabilitation facility.

Events on [**11-20**] included the discontinuation of the
patient's antibiotics.  On the evening of [**11-20**], the
patient had an episode of respiratory distress following a
period of being sat up in a chair after he had been put back
in bed.  He was treated with suctioning and bagging briefly.
However, the patient was attempting to pull out some of her
tubes and drains.  A chemistry panel was checked which showed
a hyponatremia.  Her sodium which had been 131 earlier that
day was now 121.  The patient was started on 3% hypertonic
saline at 10 cc per hour with close followup of her sodium.
The sodium was repleted back to 131 for a period of five to
six hours.  Following this, the patient's mental status
appeared to clear.

The patient had no other acute events throughout the
remainder of her hospital stay.  She remained afebrile.  Her
white blood cell count trended down.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient's condition on discharge
was stable.  Her temperature maximum for the last 24 hours
was 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 94 (in
sinus), her blood pressure was 116/50, and her respiratory
rate was 14, and her oxygen saturation was 97%.  Her current
ventilator settings were continuous positive airway pressure
with a pressure support of 15 and positive end-expiratory
pressure of 5 on 40% FIO2.  She is receiving total parenteral
nutrition at a rate of 47 cc per hour.  This is in 1150 cc
with 60 grams for dL of amino acids 170 dextrose and 23 of
lipids.  Electrolyte additives include 250 mEq of sodium
chloride, 10 of sodium phosphate, 30 of potassium chloride,
10 of potassium phosphate, 10  magnesium sulfate, 10 calcium
gluconate, 6000 units of heparin, insulin 10 units, 10 mg of
zinc, 1 mg of folate.  She receives vitamin K additive every
Monday, multivitamins once per day, and trace elements once
per day.  The patient also getting Impact with fiber at a
rate of 60 per hour full strength.  Her goal on that formula
would be 65 cc per hour which she can be advanced to.  The
goal calories for this patient, however, due to her short
gut syndrome, the patient likely not receiving much calories,
so supplemental total parenteral nutrition is warranted.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON DISCHARGE:  The patient's
laboratories on the day of discharge revealed her white blood
cell count was 11.2, her hematocrit was 29.8, and her
platelets were 369.  Her sodium was 139, potassium was 4.1,
chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 30, blood urea nitrogen was
31, creatinine was 0.8, and blood glucose was 123.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  On physical examination,
the patient was alert and following commands.  Heart was
regular in rate and rhythm.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.   The abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  Bowel sounds were present.  Her end
jejunostomy was viable and functioning, and her transverse
mucous fistula was also viable.  Her lower midline wound
separation was granulating and had some exudate at the base.
This has been treated with three times per day wet-to-dry
dressing changes using 4 X 4 soaked in quarter strength
Dakin's solution.  It has been showing good progression of
granulation tissue.
