Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma service and transferred to the
Trauma ICU where she remained intubated for 2 days. She was
eventually weaned and extubated and transferred to the regular
nursing unit. She was seen by Psychiatry given her history of
polysubstance abuse and to assess whether or not this was a
suicide attempt and if she were at risk for harming herself. It
was determined that she was not having any suicidal ideation.

Her home medications were restarted; the Clonidine dose was
decreased as she was noted with several low systolic blood
pressures. She will follow up with her primary provider as an
outpatient for further adjustment of this.

She had significant pain control issues and required PCA
initially which she reported as not helpful in controlling her
pain. She was changed to an oral regimen with IV narcotics for
breakthrough pain which was more effective. At time of discharge
she was on Oxycodone and Tylenol prn. Because of her rib
fractures and history of asthma she required supplemental oxygen
for most of her hospital stay. Once her pain was better
controlled her saturations improved significantly and her oxygen
was discontinued.

She was seen by social work for coping and emotional support. A
Physical therapy evaluation was done and she was cleared for
ambulation with a rolling walker. She was discharged to her
sister's home with the instructions for follow up.
