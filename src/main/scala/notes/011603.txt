Chief Complaint:
Admit from Cath Lab

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
56 yo M with PMh sig for HTN, hypercholestrolemia and tobacco
use who presented to the cath lab for an elective cardaic
cathaterization. He has had severeal mos of SSCP, radiating down
left arm/shoulder with activity which has increased in frequency
and occurring at rest. A nuclear stress test 1 week ago showed a
large reversible defect in LAD territory and moderate reversible
defect of PDA. LHC showed a 40% LM lesion, 99% long Mid LAD
lesion and normal LCx and non dominant RCA. Pt had successful
PTCA of LAD lesion with overlapping cypher stents. Due to the
difficulty of passing the guidewire to LAD he was exposed to sig
fluro time (2hrs) and dye load (1L), had post cath EKG with STE
in V2-V4 was transferred to CCU for IVF, HD monitroing. He was
not plavix loaded and Angiomax was shot off post procedure in
cath lab.
.
In CCU he had 1 episode of vomiting with blood clots in it. Heme
+, OG lavage with 500cc NS with no evidence of active bleed. HD
stable.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed
single vessel disease. The LMCA had a distal 40% stenosis. The
LAD had a
long complex 99% lesion in the mid vessel. The LCx had no
angiographically significant disease. The RCA was a small,
nondominant
vessel with no significant stenoses.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an aortic pressure of
128/87mmHg.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the 99% complex mid LAD
stenosis was
performed with two overlapping 3.0x33 mm Cypher stents.
Prolonged dye
and radiation exposure resulted due to the complexity of the
case.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection,
and TIMI
3 flow.  (see PTCA comments)
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD with drug eluting
stents.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo M with CAD, 99% LAD lesion s/p cypher stents x 2,
complicated by prolonged flouro and IV dye load who subsequnetly
had one episode of vomiting clots, clear lavage, HD stale.
.
Cardiac:
# Ischemia
s/p LAD stent placement
- decrease ASA to 81mg due to UGI bleed
- Plavix for at least 1 yr
- increase lipitor to 80mg qd given elevated LDL, TG, TC; LFTs
WNL
- serial CKs improving, check EKG for resolution of STE V2-V4
- currently CP free
.
# Pump
Normal LVEF from echo done 1 yr ago. If sig increase in CK post
intervention would consider repeat echo outpt for eval of ant
wall motion LVEF.
- increase metoprolol to 50 [**Hospital1 **]
- off diltiazem to prevent dual nodal blockade
- Start low dose ACE-I and titrate
- no signs of heart failure on exam, EF>75%
.
# Rhythm
NSR, cont BB
.
# Valve
No sig valvualr abnormality or murmurs
.
# Renal
- hydrate with 1/2NS @ 200cc/hr given the sig iv dye load. Will
also give 4 doses of po mucomyst
- creatinine stable, urine output adequate
- pt tolerating PO, no need for aggressive hydration
.
# GI
Pt with one episode post cath approx 400 cc coffee ground
emesis, NG lavage clear 500 cc. Has 2 peripheral IVs, Hct 38.4.

- serial Hct stable, no signs of active bleeding
- 2 U PRBCs on hold if needed
- No need for GI consult unless has rebleed or becomes HD
unstable.
- Cont with IVFs, IV protonix
- EGD scheduled outpatient to eval GI bleed
.
# Asthma
No Wheeze on PE, Pulse Ox 98% on 2L, no SOB. Will keep on PRN
Alb MDI for sob/wheeze
.
# GERD
- Switch to po protonix since serial Hcts stable, decreasing
concern for persisten GI bleed, tolerating PO
.
# Prophy
PO PPI, no sq heparin given possibility of GIB
.

please call your primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] you develop chest

evaluate for inflammation in your stomach.
You are being prescribed changes in your medication:
New - atenolol
New- plavix
New - lisinopril
Change - lower dose of aspirin to a baby aspirin
