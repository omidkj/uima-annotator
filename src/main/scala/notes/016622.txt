Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 89 yo male with hx of dementia found
unresponsive and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU
.
# Sepsis due to UTI: Mr. [**Known lastname 31251**] was resuscitated with
intravenous fluids and started on Zosyn empirically on [**2156-10-28**]
for urinary tract infection / urosepsis. Urine culture grew
proteus that was sensitive to ceftriaxone, and so the patient
was switched on hospital day 4 to ceftriaxone. He was then
transitioned to oral antibiotics on [**11-5**] (Keflex) which should
be continued to complete a 14 day course.
.
# Respiratory failure: The patient was very tachypneic on
admission to the hospital, and was intubated on [**2156-10-28**] for
impending respiratory failure. He was successfully extubated on
[**2156-10-31**].
.
# CAD: Patient likely had NSTEMI on admission in setting of afib
with [**Date Range 5509**]. Peak troponin was 0.45. He was continued on ASA, BB,
coumadin.
.
# Acute renal failure: Pre-renal azotemia that repsonded to
fluids.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient had a difficult to control
ventricular response while intubated and not taking POs because
of concern for colonic obstruction and ileus. He was loaded with
IV amiodarone without success in rate control, and amiodarone
was not continued. He responded to IV and then PO Lopressor once
he tolerated PO medications.
Currently rate-controlling with lopressor and anti-coagulated
with warfarin.
.
# Alzheimer's Dementia: At baseline.
.
# Dysphagia: Patient failed speech and swallow evaluation on
[**11-1**] s/p extubation. Per daughter and outside nursing home he
showed no signs of aspiration prior to current admission and
current issues are likely secondary to acute illness and
intubation. HE was kept NPO and then performed better on a
repeat evaluation and was started on pureed solids with nectar
thick liquids. No thin liquids. - NPO except meds
.
# Colonic ileus: The patient has a history of ischemic stricture
s/p stent in hepatic flexure. Initially, he had a large volume
~1L of fluid aspirated when NGT was initially inserted on
admission. Serial KUBs showed large bowel dilation and
pseudoobstruction. Gradually with bowel meds his abdominal exam
improved and became less distended, he passed more consistent
stools, and re-trialed on POs.
.
# Type 1 RTA: Diagnosed here with low serum bicarb and urine pH
studies. Started on PO bicarbonate.
.
# Depression: continued on effexor
.
# Code Status: FULL CODE - transitioned to DNR after discussions
with palliative care, primary medical team and daughter [**Name (NI) 17**]
who is the health care proxy. She agreed to no chest
compressions although she believes he would want intuation and
pressors. This issue should be readdressed frequently to
transition towards a full DNR/DNI code status.
