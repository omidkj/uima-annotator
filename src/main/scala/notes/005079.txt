Allergies:
Iodine / Betadine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
Left hilar mass.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronch/med/ left thoracotomy bullectomy, talc pleuradesis [**2195-8-18**]
trach/peg [**2195-8-31**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 68 year-old male with a history of severe COPD,
emphysema and bullous disease, who was recently diagnosed with a
left hilar mass, two
biopsies of which were negative. Two biopsies were done with
TBNA and were negative. The patient also has a past medical
history of multiple skin cancers as well as history of tobacco
use, parotid resection times 2 for adenocystic
carcinoma  that required a right lower lobe wedge that showed
metastatic adenocystic carcinoma in the lower lobe.  The patient
was admitted electively to undergo a bronchoscopy and
mediastinoscopy and, in case it was negative, he would undergo a
thoracotomy with possible resection of his left hilar mass. His
preoperative PFT's were borderline and it was obvious that he
would not tolerate a left pneumonectomy but he would do well
with a left upper lobectomy.


Past Medical History:
basal cell carcinoma s/p multiple skin resections
HTN
SVT
COPD
bx hilar mass with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma
bilateral nephrolithiasis
carotid artery stenosis
history of syncope (echo negative)

adenocystic carcinoma.  It is positive for CK-7 and TTF-1 and
negative for CK20, supporting a pulmonary origin.

CXR [**2195-9-5**]: IMPRESSION:
Small left pleural effusion has changed in distribution, but not
in overall size, including a small loculation projecting over
the region of atelectasis in the left midlung. Left basal
atelectasis has worsened slightly. Right lung is clear. Moderate
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.  Tracheostomy
tube is now midline. Emphysema is best demonstrated in the right
upper lung zone.



Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2195-8-18**]
for bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, left thoractomy, bullectomy,
shave biopsy of left hilar mass, and talc pleurodesis. Following
surgery, he was taken to the PACU for observation and
transferred to the general wards after clearance. He did require
some neoepinephrine for hypotension but was taken off it POD2.
Fluid boluses provided additional intravascular repletion and
his blood pressure maintained within normal limits.  Epidural
was provided for pain control and oxygen provided via nasal
cannula for comfort. On POD2, patient found to have shortness of
breath, increased work of breathing, desaturation down to 80% on
face mask. CXR done showing pulmonary edema. Patient was NT
suctioned, lasix given with nebulizing treatment, stabilizing
his respiratory status. Without improvement in respiration
following treatment, patient was taken for flexible bronchoscopy
later that evening, intubated, and transferred to SICU for
further management. Bronchoscopy showed thick secretions and
mucus plugs, BAL done for culture and cytology analysis.
Cultures positive for Methicillin sensitive staph aureus and
nafcillin started for coverage. He was kept on CPAP with
pressure support. POD5, OGT provided to start tube-feeding. CT
with airleak and kept on water seal. Surgical team attempt to
wean ventilatory status. Patient was hypotensive and epidural
capped upon transfer to ICU. Neo was resumed for pressor
support. He was taken to OR again by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for trach/PEG
placement POD13 due to failure to successfully wean from vent.
Patient also placed on IV steroids to treat COPD and improve
respiratory status. Post tracheostomym patient able to
successfully wean from extubation. He was provided with
Passy-uir valve to help with speaking. Swallowing study on POD16
provided diet recommendations. Patient advanced to ground solids
and thin liquids, advanced to regular food as tolerated. On
POD18, patient went into atrial fibrillation. Lopressor provided
but did not convert immediately. He was hypotensive to sbp
70-80. No acute distress and asymptomatic. Responded to fluids
boluses later that evening. Cardiology also consulted to make
recommendations for at home regimen. His electrolytes were
monitored and repleted. Patient now will be dc home off
atenolol, lopressor 37.5mg every 6 hours and lisinopril added
for more bp control. On POD20, patient's tracheostomy tube was
replaced with unfenestrated 6Fr trach tube for better
ventilation in outpatient setting. He is stable, tolerating
regular foods, afebrile, ambulating, oxygenating with
tracheostomy and will be discharged to vent rehab for
conditioning support.
