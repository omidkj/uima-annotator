[**2130-12-1**] CXR
1. Evidence of mild congestive heart failure, with greater
cephalization than before.
2. Persistent retrocardiac opacity without definite evidence for
superimposed pneumonia.
[**2130-12-1**] Left Hip XR - Comminuted intertrochanteric fracture
with mild valgus angulation. These results were posted to the ED
dashboard at approximately 1:45 p.m. on the day of the study.
[**2130-12-2**] Head CT -
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality on the
non-contrast study.
2. Cerebral atrophy.
3. Findings consistent with chronic microvascular infarcts.
[**2130-12-4**] Echo
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel
CAD. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.  Compared
with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-8-24**], the
severity of mitral regurgitation is increased and pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension with right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis are now seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo with multiple medical problems including congestive heart
failure with an EF of 35%, coronary artery disease s/p MI in
[**2115**], Atrial Fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and
peripheral vascular disease was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after left hip
fracture.
.
1. Left Hip Fracture.
Patient was admitted with left hip fracture. His pre-op course
was complicated by respiratory distress and aspiration
pneumonia. However he underwent his left hip ORIF on [**2130-12-12**]
without complication. Pain control has been with scheduled
tylenol dosing and 2.5mg oxycodone prn for breakthrough. Further
narcotics have been avoided given patient's apneic episodes in
the setting of narcotics use. DVT prophylaxis has included
lovenox 30 SC daily to be taken for four weeks after surgery.
.
2. Respiratory Distress
Shortly after admission, patient had respiratory apnea x 2,
necessitating code blue and bag mask ventilation. During both
episodes, patient improved with bag ventilation alone and was
monitored in the MICU. Neurology was consulted and his apnea was
thought likely secondary to [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name 6056**] respirations that were
further depressed with narcotics use. Shortly after these apneic
episodes, patient developed a fever and was noted to have
increased crackles with a productive cough. CXR was notable for
a left sided infiltrate. He was started on ceftriaxone and
flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia and is to complete a
fourteen day course with PO ceftin and PO flagyl. He has
continued to improve clinically with chest PT, increased
mobility, nebulizer treatments, and antibiotics.
.
3. Sparse growth of Aspergillus
During the work-up for patient's respiratory distress, sputum
cultures were sent. Sparse growth of aspergillus was noted.
Unclear if sparse aspergillus growth represents an actual
infection or contaminant. To further evaluate aspergillus,
patient would need either a bronchoscopy/BAL and/or chest CT
with contrast. Given patient's chronic renal insufficiency,
chest CT was not recommended. Given patient's improving clinical
appearance, decision was made with patient and family to not
pursue any further invasive testing at this time, including BAL.
Would recommend continuing to follow closely. Galactomannan and
beta glucan tests are pending.
.
4. Candiduria
As part of fever work-up, urine cultur was sent and grew yeast.
Thought to be likely colonization and no further treatment was
continued.
.
5. Gout
Patient has a history of gout in both knees. Duringt his
admission, he was found to have minimal erythema and swelling.
Uric Acid was slightly elevated at 9.5 and ESR was also elevated
at 95. Rheumatology was consulted and performed a tap of his
knee which was notable for gout crystals. Joint fluid cx was
negative.
.
6. Coronary Artery Disease
Patient has a history of CAD s/p CABG in [**2115**]. He remained on
his outpatient regimen of metoprolol, imdur, and statin. Unclear
why patient is not on an ACEI. Would consider adding to his
regimen in the future.
.
7. Congestive Heart Failure
Patient has a known EF of 30-35%. His lasix was initially held
and he became slightly overloaded. His volume status improved
with restarting of his home dose of lasix.  He was otherwise
maintained on his metoprolol, imdur.
.
8. Atrial Fibrillation
Patient was maintained with rate control with  metoprolol 25mg
PO bid. Patient is not on anticoagulation due to a history of GI
bleed.
.
9. Peripheral Vascular Disease
Patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease with a
previous revascularization. During this admission, he was found
to have a right foot infected ulcer with exposed necrotic bone.
WOund culture was notable for polymicrobial growth. He was
evaluated by wound care and podiatry who debrided the wound and
recommend sulfasalazine and further outpatient follow-up.
.
10. Acute on CRI
Patient has chronic renal insufficiency thought likely secondary
to diabetes mellitus and hypertension. His baseline creatinine
was 2.5 and increased to 3.3 for a short time but improved
initially
