Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary vein isolation/ablation
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
84 y.o male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation,
status post failure of amiodarone and direct cardioversion x3
who was admitted to the hospital 2 days ago for a pulmonary vein
isolation procedure. He initially converted to sinus rhythm,
however reverted to atrial fibrillation subsequently.
.
The day after his procedure, he developed some worsening
shortness of breath and on chest x-ray was found to have some
pulmonary edema. He was given lasix without response. This
morning, he got up to go to the bathroom and suddenly developed
acute onset left sided hemiparesis. A code stroke was called he
underwent emergent CTA of the head and neck, which showed no
demonstrable clot but high grade right ICA stenosis with poor
flow. Given his anticoagulation and recent procedure he was not
a candidate for TPA per neurology. He then developed worsening
shortness of breath and desaturation on the floor, and was then
intubated on the floor prior to transfer to the CCU.

Pertinent Imaging Results:
Studies:
CT Brain [**8-18**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Head CT shows chronic infarct in the cerebellum, but no
evidence of acute hemorrhage or mass effect seen.
2. CT perfusion demonstrates no definite perfusion defect.
3. CT angiography of the neck demonstrates 60-70% stenosis of
the proximal
right internal carotid artery but the evaluation is somewhat
limited secondary to exuberant calcification adjacent to the
area.
4. CT angiography of the head demonstrates mild atherosclerotic
disease at
the left vertebral artery and proximal basilar artery with some
dolichoectasia of the left vertebral artery.

CTA Head and Neck [**8-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Head CT shows chronic infarct in the cerebellum, but no
evidence of acute hemorrhage or mass effect seen.
2. CT perfusion demonstrates no definite perfusion defect.
3. CT angiography of the neck demonstrates 60-70% stenosis of
the proximal
right internal carotid artery but the evaluation is somewhat

4. CT angiography of the head demonstrates mild atherosclerotic
disease at
the left vertebral artery and proximal basilar artery with some
dolichoectasia of the left vertebral artery.

Head CT [**8-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of hypodensity in the right centrum
semiovale,
compatible with acute-subacute lacunar infarct.
2. No intracranial hemorrhage or large vascular territory
infarction.
3. Stable left cerebellar encephalomalacia.
4. Diffuse mucosal thickening involving the paranasal sinuses,
mastoid air
cells, and ethmoid air cells. Secretions in the posterior
nasopharynx are
compatible with intubation.

CAROTID U/S [**8-22**]:
Impression: Right ICA stenosis 60-69%.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 y.o male with past medical history significant for afib s/p
pulmonary vein isolation, diastolic congestive heart failure who
presents now with acute shortness of breath after suffering from
a right sided stroke on the floor.
.
Major and Active Problems during hospitalization:
# Stroke: Evidence of high grade internal carotid stenosis on CT
scan. Patient is not a candidate for TPA given that he is on
coumadin and he is peri-procedure. Furthermore, there was no
evidence of a clot.  A carotid US demonstrated stenosis: R
60-69%, and L stenosis < 40%, but an endarterectomy is not
warrented at this time.  Permissive HTN was allowed to to
preserve the penumbra.  Upon discharge, his neuro exam was
non-focal.  He was moving all four extremities without any
decrease in strength.
- Please monitor blood pressure: goal SBP 140's.
.
# Congestive heart failure: The patient had acute pulmonary
edema currently which is likely the cause of his hypoxia on the
floor. He was intubated and diuresed.  His blood pressure was
markedly elevated, which may have lead to flash pulmonary edema.

.
# Atrial fibrillation:  Due to his stroke his blood pressure was
allowed to rise, and his rate was difficult to control.  He
required esclating doeses of metoprolol and diltiazem, as well
as amiodarone.  His current regiment includes metoprolol XL in
the am, and extended release diltiazem in the pm.
- For any new medications, please check interaction with
amiodarone.
- Please check INR daily until > 2.0.  Then, please check INR
twice weekly.
.
# Hypertension: His blood pressure was permissively high after
his CVA with SBP in the 180's.  As he regained neurological
function, he was restrated on his blood pressure medications.
He was started on a clonidine patch which helped control his
blood pressure.
.
# Acute kidney injury: He had an elevated Cr that was thought to
be scondeary to decreased forward flow.  His renal function
improved, and has normalized.
