Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure
Pneumonia
Lung mass


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronch with palliative stenting of L main stem bronchus
([**2105-2-11**])
bronchoscopy [**2-14**]
Central line placement
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Known lastname **] is a 48 yo man c hx of NSCLC stage III A s/p
Carboplatin and XRT on [**5-10**] and s/p LUL lobectomy on [**9-9**].
Postop course complicated by actinic esophagitis (s/p PEG tube
placemnt and tracheostomy).
.
Pt last CT scan [**5-12**] scan c LUL small mass suspicious for
recurrent Ca.
Pt admitted on [**2105-1-20**] to OSH for fever, leukocytosis and
worsening hypoxia. CT of chest showed new large paratracheal
mediastinal mass c small pleural effusion. Pt was started on
ceftriaxone + Levofloxacin. Pt had no improvement with worsening
fever, hypotension, sepsis, hypoxemia and with deteriorating
renal function. He was intubated and started on hemodialysis.
ATB treatment was switched to Vancomycin, Meropenem,
Fluconazole. Also started on PO Vanc for questionable C diff.
.
MRSA [**1-25**] of sputum grew MRSA . blood cx , urine cx (-). TEE (-)
for IE. Tip culture (-)
.
He was admitted to Surgery on [**2105-2-8**] .
Bronchoscopy was done which showed completely occluded L main
stem bronchi. Pathology confirmed presence of NSCLL.
The initial plan was to take to OR for debridement. However,
considering pt's poor prognosis it was decided to put a
palliative stent. This was done today. Per verbal report of IP
fellow, there was a erythematous and easy bleeding bronchial
mucosa, without significant pus coming from L main stem.
Pt is trensferred to MICU to continue management.

bridge in the remote past (?[**2077**]). He has been on a variety of
antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing agents in the past and has
had at least two sessions of electroconvulsive therapy. He did
extremely well on Clozaril between [**2099**] and [**2102-5-7**] until
it had to be stopped because of seizures.

Substance Abuse history:
Records indicate that pt has a history of drug abuse including
heroin but pt has refused to talk about it further. Pt has a
tobacco history and reports that prior to admission he smoked
one to four cigarettes per day.


Social History:
He has mother and brother who live together with whom he has
close contacts. The patient reports that his father died of a
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in [**2065**]. Currently he is
unemployed. He did complete some college, his closest supports
are his family and staff members at his group home.

Family History:
Maternal grandfather with alcohol abuse, he denies a family
history of mental illness or suicide. Family history otherwise

[**2105-2-8**] CXR:
There is probably a small right anterior pneumothorax manifested
as deepening of the right lateral pleural sulcus, despite right
apical pleural drain. There is no pleural effusion. Tip of a
dual channel right subclavian line projects over the SVC.
Obscuration of the right hilus by a region of likely radiation
fibrosis, and distortion of the left hilus and aortopulmonic
window with left apical pleural thickening, partially calcified
are all chronic findings. Leftward mediastinal shift is more
pronounced today. ET tube is in standard placement and
nasogastric tube is coiled in the upper stomach.
Subsequent assessment of pneumothorax is better achieved with
upright radiographs and supine study, likely S1.
.
[**2105-2-10**] CT CHEST:
The patient is status post left upper lobectomy. A dialysis
catheter recently placed in an outside hospital is responsibe
for the small right pneumothorax which persists despite a right
pleural tube.

A new, partially enhancing, 7 x 4 cm left paratracheal
mediastinal mass with central hypodensity is likely necrotic
tumor (unless the patient has had recent mediastinoscopy or
transbronchial procedure, in which case some components could be
hemorrhage; it has too much internal tissue structure for an
abscess). The mass obliterate fat planes around the aortic arch,
left lateral trachea and right main pulmonary artery and
subsumes previously enlarged paratracheal nodes as it extends
along the left side of the trachea from the undersurface of the
arch of the aorta to the superior margin of the left main
bronchus which is markedly irregular, more likely due to
invasion by the mediastinal mass than retained secretions.

The left upper lobe brochial stump is clear. In addiation to
change around the left hilum there is new soft tissue opacity
around the left lower lobe and subsegmental bronchi which could
be the remnants of pneumonia or tumor recurrence in the lung.
Bronchocentric nodules in both lower lobes may represent
infection or aspiration. A small left pleural effusion, with
attenuation value of 27HU is likely an exudate.

Peribronchial thickening is noted along the right upper lobe
bronchus may also have been radiation-induced. There is no right
hilar adenopathy.

Diffuse esophageal wall thickening could be secondary to
esophagitis, but adjacent to the mass infiltration by tumor is
also very likely.

In the imaged upper abdomen, the liver, spleen and adrenals are
unremarkable. Hypodense cysts are noted in both kidneys and the
right kidney though incompletely imaged appears atrophic.

There are no bone findings suspicious for malignancy.

IMPRESSION:
1. New, large necrotic mediastinal mass, neoplasm unless proved
otherwise.
2. New peribronchial soft tissue, left hilus, either local tumor
recurrence or pneumonia.
3. Bronchocentric nodules in the lower lobes could be secondary
to aspiration and/or infection.
4. Right pneumothorax with chest tube in place.
5.
