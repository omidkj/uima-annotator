Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing fatigue and SOB


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left thoracentesis drained ~2L


History of Present Illness:
This is a 69yo male who was seen
recently in our office for surgical evaluation for AVR, now
transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] with congestive heart
failure after his second admission in recent weeks. He was
recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**2138-8-15**] after presenting from
rehab
with vomiting and abdominal pain x2 days - likely cause
determined to be severe constipation, which pt has a history of
in the past. He also had a recent PNA. He has known AS and
multiple co-morbidities including COPD, diabetes mellitus and
chronic renal insufficiency. Given history of AV node
dysfunction, he underwent placement of permanent pacemaker in
[**2138-2-8**]. Echo showed severe aortic stenosis and cath
revealed two vessel CAD - systolic and diastolic heart failure
(EF 40-45%), severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2, peak gradient
66mmHg). He is being transferred today to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaulation
for CABG/AVR.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Severely depressed
LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV free wall thickness. Normal RV
chamber size. Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS. Mild
(1+) MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may be
significantly UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Normal tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Mild to
moderate [[**2-9**]+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
 N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to akinesis of the posterior
wall and apex, and severe hypokinesis of
