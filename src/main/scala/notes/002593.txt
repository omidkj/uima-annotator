Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
contained rupture of aortic
aneurysm.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2127-10-30**] Repair of contained ruptured AAA


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an elderly male who presented
several weeks ago with a contained rupture of aortic
aneurysm. Due to his age and comorbidities we attempted an
endovascular repair.  This was successful in a sense that it
stopped the rupture, but he had a persistent type 1 endoleak.
He decided that he wanted to go home for a week or two and
think about it and then return for essentially elective
removal of the graft and repair of his aortic aneurysm. This
was going to be difficult case because the Zenith graft has
suprarenal fixation.  In addition to seal the graft, there is
a Palmaz stent that bridges across the mesenteric vessels and
there is an additional Zenith cuff. In addition, he only has
a functioning left kidney.


Past Medical History:
PMH: CABG in [**2-/2117**] with an LIMA to LAD and vein graft to the
first diagonal, obtuse marginal, and right coronary arteries

PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY [**2127-11-6**]:

FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal contours appear unchanged. New
poorly defined
opacities have developed in the mid and lower lungs bilaterally
with a
somewhat nodular quality, possibly representing airways disease
from
aspiration or infection. A dependent distribution of pulmonary
edema in the setting of underlying COPD is an additional
consideration. Improving aeration at left base is likely a
combination of improving atelectasis and effusion.  Baseline
pleural thickening persists at right lung base with possible
superimposed small pleural effusion. Asymmetric biapical
thickening is unchanged dating back to [**2123-5-22**] and attributed
to scarring.
