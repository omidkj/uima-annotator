History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 yo female with PMH significant for
hypertension, type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia
presenting with 3 weeks of worsening shortness of breath and one
week of difficulty swallowing, sent over from PCP's office to ED
for worsening dyspnea. In regards to the shortness of breath,
she notes that she has had increasing dyspnea on exertion,
getting winded going from bed to the bathroom, resolving with
rest. She notes that she has had difficulty breathing at other
times but never this bad. She denies shortness of breath at
rest. She describes the shortness of breath as the feeling that
she cannot get enough air in.  She also notes her legs have been
increasingly swollen over the past three weeks. She has [**1-19**]
pillow orthopnea ("I sleep sitting up"), also with paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea. She denies chest pain, palpitations, nausea,
vomiting, dizziness and lightheadness, nocturia.

In terms of the dysphagia, she notes feeling difficulty
swallowing solids since coming back from a trip on the 10th of
the month. She describes this as "just cannot get food down from
my mouth." She denies pain and cannot localize where food feels
stuck. She has been eating soups, juice, tea for the past
several weeks and feels this has irritated her stomach, causing
some RLQ pain. She denies regurgitation, halitosis, or GERD.

CXR [**9-9**]: Bibasilar opacities concerning for consolidation with
likely underlying right greater than left bilateral pleural
effusions.
LHC/RHC [**9-13**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
diffuse 2 vessel obstructive coronary artery disease. THe LMCA
had a 50%
ostial stenosis. The LAD had diffuse calcified disease with a
mid
subtotal occlusion. The LCX had no significant stenoses. The RCA
was
occluded in the mid portion, with the distal vessel filling via
collaterals from the LAD.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right sided
filling
pressures with a RVEDP of 24 mm Hg. Pulmonary artery pressures
were
elvated at 65/35 mm Hg. The wedge pressure was markedly elevated
at a
mean of 43 mm Hg. Calculated ardiac output and index were low at
3.8
L/min and 2 L/min/m2, respectively, using an assumed oxygen
consumption
of 125 ml O2/min/m2. The SVR was increased at 1432 dyne s/cm5.
3. Unsuccessful attempt to cross the mid LAD occlusion with a
1.5 x 9
balloon.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. 2 vessel obstructive coronary artery disease.
2. Markedly elevated right sided and wedge pressures, consistent
with
severe heart failure.
3. Unsuccessful PCI attempt of the mid-LAD.
.
TTE [**9-12**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative
preservation of the basal inferolateral and lateral walls (LVEF
= 20-25 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**11-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Severe biventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No
pericardial effusion.

CAROTID DOPPLER [**9-16**]:
