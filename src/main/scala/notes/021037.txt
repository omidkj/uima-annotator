Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation, central venous catheter placement,
arterial line placement.

History of Present Illness:
66yoM with a complicated medical history including CAD s/p CABG,
VF arrest s/p pacer/ICD, CHF (EF 25%), diabetes, OSA presenting
for altered mental status.

Per patient's daughter and wife, the patient had been
complaining of fatigue and weakness for the past several days to
week.  He had also reportedly been constantly coughing and
gasping for air in his sleep, and his daughter noted increased
swelling of his face and legs recently.  His Torsemide had been
increased from 100 mg qAM, 50 mg q afternoon to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] on
[**7-28**] by his PCPfor these symptoms.  Of note, he had been having
difficulty with his CPAP at home recently.  Per family, the
patient has not had headaches, altered mental status, neck
stiffness, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, or fevers.  He did reportedly complain of chills the
night prior to presentation.  This morning, the patient's wife
was concerned that the patient had altered mental status and
called EMS.

Per EMS report, the patient was found laying in bed moaning and
grunting.  He was reportedly confused and non-verbal but
responded to his name.  FSBS was 61, and he was given 2 tubes of
glucose paste with repeat FSBS 65 and reported to be "somewhat
verbal" subsequently.  EMS found the patient to be hypoxic with
labored respirations and he was placed on a non-rebreather.  He
was also found to be febrile to 102.  Per report, his pupils
were fixed and dilated.

In the ED, initial VS were: 102.7 113 117/58 20 88%RA, 100%
Non-Rebreather. Unresponsive, open eyes to sternal rub, but not
responsive to questions.  Satting low-mid 90's on NRB, increased
work of breathing and so was intubated for concern for tiring.
He received etomidate 20 mg, rocuronium 100 mg.  After
intubation, he was bradycardic to 47 with BP 79/56 -> 65/37.  He
was given 0.5mg atropine HR improved to 122, hypotension
persistent so he was given a total of 5L NS.  A RIJ was placed
and levophed was started.  CVP was 27.  He was hypoglycemic and
was given an amp d50 -> fsbs 136.
CXR revealed right sided fluid overload and suggestive of
probable underlying PNA.  Given Piperacillin-Tazob, Linezolid
(because of vancomycin allergy) and 1gm tylenol PR for T102.8.

C-SPINE
FINDINGS: There is no acute fracture or malalignment, and the
normal cervical lordosis is maintained. The patient is intubated
and an enteric tube has been placed, limiting the evaluation of
prevertebral soft tissue abnormality.  Again seen is
uncovertebral and endplate spondylosis with bilateral neural
foraminal narrowing, mild at C5-6 and moderate at C6-7,
unchanged from prior exam. There is also ventral spinal canal
narrowing at these respective levels, but no cord effacement is
identified.

Bilateral carotid arterial calcifications are noted. A right
side central
venous line and left-sided cardiac pacemaker lead are present.
The right
mastoid and the sphenoid air cells contain aerosolized
secretions which are likely secondary to recent endotracheal
intubation and supine positioning.

IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or acute alignment abnormality.
2. Bilateral neural foraminal and mild ventral canal narrowing
at C5-6 and
C6-7, unchanged since the [**2-/2121**] study.
