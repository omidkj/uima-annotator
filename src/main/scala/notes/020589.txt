s/p CABGx5(LIMA->LAD, SVG->Diag1, Diag2, OM, PDA) [**2181-11-5**]


History of Present Illness:
51 year male that presented on [**10-30**] with chest pain, SOB that
had been occuring for over a month. Of note, the patient has
been non-compliant with medications because of lack of insurance
because he lost his job. The patient woke up at 3am on [**10-29**]
with acute SOB. His father drove him to emergency department.
He was gasping, saturating 78% on RA, [**Doctor Last Name 352**] in color with a
respiratory rate in the 40s.
In OSH ED, he was thought to be in pulmonary edema. He was given
Lasix 240 total, morphine, placed on a non-rebreather and then
eventually bipap briefly. Then weaned to non-rebreather and then
back to 6L NC, with sats 93-95%. A foley was placed- has since
diuresed 1920cc since admission. EKG showed new left bundle on
admission, with trop of 0.15. An echo was done on [**2181-10-29**]
showing new low EF of 25% with akinesis of apex, posterior and
inferior walls, severe hypokinesis of septum and anterior walls.
Given CP, elevated trop, he was put on a heparin gtt and was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac evaluation.

Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  30% to 35%  >= 55%

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity. No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Moderately depressed LVEF. Doppler parameters are most
consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Simple
atheroma in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple
atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta. Focal calcifications in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: No TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.

Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35
%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4043**] notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine, a-pacing. Improved
biventricular systolic function. LVEF is now 40%. Improved
inferoapical and anterior hypokinesis. MR, AI, TR all remain
trace to mild. Aortic contour is normal post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred from outside hospital for cardiac evaluation,
underwent cardiac catherization that revealed coronary artery
disease.  He underwent preoperative workup for cardiac surgery.
On [**11-5**] was brought to the operating room and underwent
coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  See operative report for
further details.  He was transferred to the intensive care unit
for hemodynamic management.  In the first twenty four hours he
was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was
extubated without complications.  On postoperativ
