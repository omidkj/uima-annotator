HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59-year-old
male, who was admitted to the CCU status post left carotid
artery stent placement.  Patient has a history of transient
ischemic attack in the past that subsequently showed
bilateral carotid stenosis of 40%.  Since then, the patient
has had two episodes of visual changes in the left eye that
patient described as "blind being drawn over the eye" that
was consistent with amaurosis fugax, as well as symptoms of
postural dizziness.  The patient underwent carotid duplex
study on [**2143-6-25**] which showed 80% stenosis of left internal
carotid artery and 40% stenosis of right internal carotid
artery.  Subsequently, patient was admitted for carotid
angiogram and percutaneous intervention by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease.  Patient has had numerous cardiac
catheterizations including cardiac catheterization in [**2140-10-23**] status post distal RCA stent placement, cardiac
catheterization [**7-/2140**] status post proximal OM-1 stent for
70% proximal stenosis, cardiac catheterization on [**10-23**] which
showed an ejection fraction of 68%, right dominant system.
RCA was 30% mid stenosis and distal RCA and obtuse marginal
stents patent.  Since then, the patient has a normal exercise
stress test on [**11-24**].
2. Hypercholesterolemia.
3. Emphysema by pulmonary function tests on [**5-25**] showing
mild obstructive pattern of gas trapping.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease.
[**Name (NI) **] brother died at the age of 58 of myocardial
infarction.  [**Name (NI) **] sister had CABG and died thereafter at
the age of 61.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive for smoking.  Patient initially
quit in [**2127**], but recently restarted with four cigarettes a
day.  Patient is married.  His wife lives in [**Country 2559**].  Patient
has been going to [**Country 2559**] frequently to see his family.

On arrival to the CCU, the patient was afebrile with a blood
pressure of 170/78, pulse of 54, respirations 21, O2
saturation of 93% on room air.  Physical examination showed a
nice gentleman in no apparent distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Patient's visual field examination was significant for left
visual field cut on his left eye.  Patient's right visual
field examination was normal.  Ophthalmoscopic examination
nondilated eyes revealed no gross abnormalities.  Neck:
There was a right carotid bruit, no jugular venous
distention.  No left carotid bruits were appreciated.
Pulmonary was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular was regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2,
there were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Patient
has good bowel sounds.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended without organomegaly.  Extremities:  There was
no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema noted.  Right groin:  There
were no bruits or hematomas and normal peripheral pulses.

LABORATORY VALUES:  Patient had normal white count,
hematocrit was stable at 43.9; the patient's platelets were
131.  Patient's renal panel was normal with BUN and
creatinine of 13 and 1.0 respectively.

Patient's initial electrocardiogram was significant for sinus
bradycardia with a ventricular of 40-50 beats per minute.

Carotid angiogram:  Left carotid angiogram showed 90% distal
occlusion of the common carotid artery and 90% occlusion of
internal carotid artery with ulceration, Percusurge wire was
used and two stents were placed in ACA and MCA. Ophthalmic artery
was visualized and was patent, but patient did develop blurry
vision after the stents were placed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted for CCU for close
monitoring initially target systolic blood pressure was
140s-160s.  Patient was started on Neo-Synephrine drip, with
which a target blood pressure goal was achieved.
Subsequently over the course of the night and the next day,
Neo-Synephrine was being weaned off.  Over the course of the
night, patient did have an episode of asymptomatic
bradycardia with heart rate in the 30s to 40s.  Patient was
given one dose of atropine with resulting heart rate
posttreatment in the 60s and systolic blood pressure at goal.

Over the course of the next day, Neo-Synephrine was titrated
off in order to maintain the goal systolic blood pressure of
140.  The patient was given several boluses of normal saline
to 150 cc to maintain systolic blood pressure at goal.
Patient has remained asymptomatic.  Was able to ambulate with
the help of Physical Therapy.

At the day of discharge, the patient's systolic blood
pressure was ranging from the 110-120s.  The patient was seen
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], and it was in agreement between the patient
and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] that the day following the discharge, the
patient was going to followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for blood
pressure check.

2. Renal:  Patient maintained stable creatinine and
electrolytes, and excellent urinary output.

3. Ophthal/Neuro:  Patient had dilated ophthalmologic
examination by Ophthalmology service on the day of admission,
which did show a cholesterol embolus at one of the branches
of retinal artery and edema surrounding it, which was not
consistent with ischemia or optic neuropathy, but rather an
occlusion of a retinal artery branch with cholesterol
embolus.  Patient was started on Alphagan as well as eyeball
massage.

Over the course of the next day, the patient's usual visual
field cut was resolved, and his visual field symptoms were
improving, although his vision out of the left eye did remain
somewhat blurry.  The patient has been followed by
Ophthalmology daily.  It was decided to followup in
[**Hospital 8183**] Clinic 1-2 weeks following discharge.

Neurologic:  Since admission, the patient has been on close
neurochecks and exhibited no focal neurologic deficits.  Of
note, left visual field changes were addressed as above.

4. Pulmonary:  History of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  Patient maintained good oxygenation with home MDI
regimen.

5. Prophylaxis:  SubQ Heparin was administered to the patient
while the patient was unable to ambulate being due to status
post carotid angiogram.

6. Disposition:  Patient was discharged with a close followup
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] the day following the discharge for vitals
check.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Carotid artery stenosis status post
right carotid artery stent placement.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Atorvastatin 40 mg po q day.
2. Plavix 75 mg po q day.
3. Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
4. Alphagan as well as outpatient MDIs.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to hold
and not to take his blood pressure medicines until discussed
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] upon discharge.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:
1. The patient is to followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] the day
following discharge for blood pressure check.
2. Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in clinic 1-2 weeks.
3. [**Hospital 8183**] Clinic:  The patient is to schedule followup
in [**1-24**] weeks after discharge.  Patient in the meanwhile is to
still continue Alphagan and follow up with an ophthalmologist
sooner if visual changes persist and do not improve.
