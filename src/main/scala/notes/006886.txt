History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 71 yo F w/ h/o seizures who was recently admitted to the
neuro service with herpes encephalitis who presents with fevers
and hypotension.  She had completed the course of acyclovir on
[**12-12**] and was currently at [**Hospital 15303**] Rehab after recent [**Hospital1 18**]
stay.  New "baseline" per daughters included repeating herself,
decreased short-term memory, restlessness, and agitation
sometimes at night (ie, pulling tubes).  Yesterday, she fell and
hit her head while trying to climb out of bed, she was cleared
by doctor at facility but no head scan done.  She then developed
fever to 104, vomiting, headache this evening and had
"seizure-like" activity witnessed by nurse at rehab.  Otherwise
at this time patient unable to give any history.
.
In the ED, the patient received Vanco 1g, Decadron 10mg, CTx 2g,
Acyclovir 700mg, flagyl 500 mg.  Her pressure had dropped to
80/36, still with high O2 requirement.  Labs rechecked and
Hemoglobin down to 7.8 from 9.1, though lactate slightly lower.
Had brief episode of aflutter.  Sepsis protocol initiated;
levophed started to increase sbp to goal 90s.

Past Medical History:
-recent herpes simplex type 1 encephalitis- treated w/
acyclovir- PCR from [**12-8**] negative
-seizure disorder since [**91**]; had 3 GTC seizures; also partial
complex seizures: would stare, not respond and make circling
movement with her R-arm for example on the table in front of her
(per family); followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) 15304**] problems, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) **]/p knee fracture

ECG- Sinus tachy, 100, normal axis, normal intervals,
non-specific ST changes in V5-V6
.
CT head- [**12-20**]
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
2. Stable areas of edema in the right temporal and frontal
lobes, unchanged from study of four days prior.
.
Hip/knee X-ray [**12-20**]
No definite evidence for acute traumatic injury to the right hip
or right knee.
.
CXR [**12-23**]
1. Improving pulmonary edema.
2. Worsening bibasilar opacities, likely due to a combination of
atelectasis and effusion.
3. Improving right upper lobe opacity, which may be due to
asymmetric edema or improving pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 71 yo F w/ h/o seizure, recent herpes encephalitis p/w
fevers and ?seizure like activity prior to presentation to the
ED.
.
# [**Name (NI) 15305**] Pt with several possible sources for sepsis given + UA
and likely PNA on CXR and recent herpes encephalitis. Initially
febrile, with hypotension requiring pressors.  Lactate normal
although most likely cause of hypotension thought to be
pneumonia.  She was started on sepsis protocol in the ED, with
Goal CVP>8, Goal MAP>60, Goal SvO2>70.  On day of admission her
hct was 23 and she was given 1 unit prbc.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim was done
which showed good response.  She was started on vancomycin and
zosyn.  Acyclovir was also started given recent hsv encephalitis
admission.  She was also started on Insulin gtt for goal glucose
80-120.  She improved during her admission requiring less O2 per
day and with good blood pressure.  Levophed was weaned off, she
remained afebrile in the ICU after the initial temperature of
104.  Antibiotics were changed to levo/flagyl to treat her RUL
pneumonia after the blood cx were negative; her CXR on [**12-23**]
showed resolving infection although her atelectasis/effusion did
not improve.  She will finish 7 more days of levo/flagyl and
taper quickly off the dexamethasone in the week after discharge.
 Acyclovir was discontinued after her CSF PCR was negative.  She
is hemodynamically stable, afebrile w/ normal WBC and appears
well.
.
# Mental status changes - [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to sepsis vs
recurrent herpes encephalitis vs post ictal from seizures vs
stroke.  Pt also had fall at rehab in the day prior to admission
and then developed HA and vomiting, which was also concerning
for possible SDH.  CT scan showed no ICH.  LP was done which had
wbc count; however it was mainly lymphocytic.  HSV PCR was
ordered, and she was empirically treated w/ acyclovir until the
results came back negative.  She was continued on decadron per
neuro recs who followed pt during her stay in the icu.  Her
mental status returned to baseline with resolving infection and
hemodynamic stability.
.
# Seizure disorder- On regimen of phenobarbital and phenytoin as
outpatient.  Phenytoin level at 24 based on albumin of 3.3 on
admission.  Decreased phenytoin to 100mg tid and levels within
therapeutic range prior to discharge.  She did not have any
episodes of seizure like activity during her admission.
.
# Knee pain - pt complained of knee pa
