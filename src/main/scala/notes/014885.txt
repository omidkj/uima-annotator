Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
51 yo M with no significant past medical history admitted with
PE found at OSH. Patient thought he had some "congestion" which
developed over a week ago. He took Robitussin and then Mucinex
w/out relief. He then started to feel short of breath with
exertion, after going to the bathroom and walking from his car
to the office. Patient then went to his PCP who prescribed
Albuterol prn for shortness of breath also with little relief.
Patient was then seen at work by [**Name8 (MD) **] RN who found that he was
hypoxic. His PCP then referred him to the ED at an OSH ([**Hospital1 **]).
At the OSH: VS HR 125 BP 129/84 R 36 O2 sat 91% RA. ABG
7.5/29/59. EKG showing sinus tach with TWI V2-V3 (new compared
to prior EKG). A CT was performed which reveiled a saddle PE,
Dimer >1050 and he was started on IV Heparin w/out lysis. He was
then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

ROS - Patient denies any feelings of sob prior to this, very
occasionally used Albuterol in the past, no feelings of
palpitations, dizziness, no chest pain or pressure, no pleuritic
chest pain. No cough, sputum production, no hematemesis,
fevers/chills. Patient reports, however, not being able to
expand his chest enough and not being able to fill his lungs
with enough air. He also reports a funny sensation as though
"something were stuck in there" behind his left knee, no frank
leg swelling or tenderness. He states that his calves are always
very hard and stiff. No history of any long bone fractures or
any trauma. Recent >10 lb weight loss [**2-16**] to social stressors.

In the MICU - Patient admitted to MICU overnight, continued on
IV Heparin, CE negative x 1, ECHO done (preliminary) showing RV
strain, elevated PA pressures to ~70, significant TR with RV
pressure overload.

ECG:  Sinus rhythm. Non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.

TTE [**2-3**]:
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: 4.2 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm)
Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: 3.9 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 30% (nl >=55%)
TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *50 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)

INTERPRETATION:
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Depressed LVEF. LV dysnchrony is present.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Markedly dilated RV
cavity. Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis. Abnormal septal
motion/position.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate to severe [3+] TR. Moderate PA
systolic
hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function appears
depressed, at least moderately and possibly severe. The views
are limited to make an accurate assessment. Left ventricular
dysnchrony is present.
3.The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. There is
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal
motion/position.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve insufficiency
seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation
seen.
6. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.

LENIs [**2158-2-5**]:  IMPRESSION: Intraluminal thrombus identified
within the right popliteal vein, and extending into the distal
most aspect of the right superficial femoral vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo man with no significant past medical history admitted with
shortness of breath and hypoxia found to have a saddle PE with
severe right heat strain, initially admitted to MICU for close
monitoring given the extent of his PE.

1) Pulmonary Embolus:  He was immediately started on IV heparin
with PTT kept 60-100.  He had no significant events in the MICU,
with oxygen saturation stable on 2-4L in the mid-90s.  He was
transfered to the floor after one night in the MICU.  He had an
echocardiogram on [**2-3**] which demonstrated severe R heart strain
with 3+ TR, marked dilation and hypokinesis of the RV, as well
as secondary compromise of LV function, with moderately to
severely depressed LVEF.  Despite this, the patient was able to
be quickly weaned off of O2 completely, with ambulatory sat 95%
on RA on the day of discharge.  He never had hemodynamic
instability, and it was therefore decided not to proceed with
lysis.  He had a LENI which demonstrated extensive RLE DVT, the
presumed source for his PE.

In terms of his risk factors, he does smoke heavily and was
encouraged to quit.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6160**] at
[**Hospital1 18**] for hypercoagulable workup.  Some of the workup was
initiated in house, however some of the assays are unreliable in
the presence of coumadin.  It should also be noted that the
patient was on folate when homocysteine was checked in our
system, therefore this result is unreliable.

He was discharged on lovenox which should be continued for at
least 48 hours after his INR is therapeutic on coumadin (goal
[**2-17**], 2.5-3.5 if APA positive).  He will take 10 mg coumadin for
2 days after discharge, and thereafter his PCP will instruct him
on the dose depending on his INR.  He will have his INR checked
with his PCP 2 days after discharge.

He should have another echocardiogram to monitor his LVEF and R
heart function in about 3-4 weeks after discharge, which should
be set up by his PCP.

2) Gout:  He complained of R knee swelling, pain, and tenderness
starting the day prior to discharge, which he says is his
"gout."  Exam was consistent with gout and he also had some R
metatarsal pain.  He was discharged on a 6 day course of
prednisone for presumed mild gout flare.  He will take protonix
for GI prophylaxis while on high do
