Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2104-4-21**] Two Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing a
free left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
artery with saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 110616**] is a 77 year old male with multiple cardiac risk
factors and known cardiomyopathy. He recently underwent ETT
which revealed a large fixed anterior wall defect, suggestive of
prior MI with an overall LVEF of 35%. He was subsequently
referred for cardiac catheterization which revealed a 90% left
main lesion. He remained pain free on medical therapy and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical revascularization.

[**2104-4-17**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
with global hypokinesis and a relative sparing of the basal
inferolateral segment (LVEF= 15 %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated left ventricle with normal wall
thickness and severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Mildly
dilated aortic root and aortic arch. No clinically signficant
valvular regurgitation or stenosis. Normal pulmonary artery
systolic pressure.

[**2104-4-17**] Carotid Ultrasound:
Right antegrade vertebral artery flow. Left antegrade vertebral
artery flow. Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA <40% stenosis.
.
[**2104-4-18**] Cardiac MR:
1. Moderately increased left ventricular cavity size. Global
left ventricular hypokinesis with severe hypokinesis to akinesis
of the mid to distal anterior wall, apex, and entire inferior
wall. Abnormal motion of the septum and left ventricular
intraventricular dyssynchrony. The LVEF was severely depressed
at 23%.
2. No CMR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction.
3. Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal global and
regional
systolic function. The RVEF was normal at 49%.
4. Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
5. Mild biatrial enlargement.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 110616**] was admitted to cardiac surgical service and
underwent further preoperative evaluation. Echocardiogram
confirmed severely depressed LV function with an EF 15%. There
was no aortic valve disease with only trivial mitral
regurgitation. Cardiac MR [**First Name (Titles) 654**] [**Last Name (Titles) 110617**] myocardium. He remained
pain free on medical therapy, and was eventually cleared for
surgery. On [**4-21**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed two vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting. For surgical details, please see
operative note. Given his prolonged hospital stay, Vancomycin
was used for perioperative antibiotic coverage. Following
surgery, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring.

Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. He maintained stable hemodynamics
and transferred to the floor on postoperative day one. He
remains on Imdur for his free left internal mammary artery graft
for three months.  Low dose beta blocker was started and the
Electrophysiology Service was consulted due to his chronic
Wenchebach block. This was changed to Carvedilol due to his
systolic dysfunction. An echocardiogram prior to discharge
demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20% (v.
10-15% immediaetly off bypass).
