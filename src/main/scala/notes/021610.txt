Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress, tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is an 80M w/ COPD, CAD, HTN, with a complicated recent past
medical history, who originally presented after a fall on
[**2132-9-17**] in which he suffered a splenic laceration which was
treated with coil emobolization. He then developed a splenic
abscess that required splenectomy. The post op course was
further complicated by an enteric fistula and another abscess in
the splenic bed which was drained by IR. He then developed
respiratory failure and had a tracheostomy placed He was also
treated for c.diff during this time as well. On [**1-9**], he
returned to [**Hospital1 18**] for cholecystitis and had a perc
cholecystostomy tube placed. The pt has been followed by ID for
these recurrent infections.
.
He now returns from rehab because of a possible aspiration
event. He was tachypneic and tachycardic in the ED to the
150-160. He was febrile to 103 and had a CXR that showed a LLL
infiltrate. He was treated with vanco, flagyl for presumed
aspiration pneumonia and admitted to the TSICU.

IMAGING:

[**1-15**] CT torso: Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
than right. Bibasilar centrilobular pulmonary opacities,
concerning for aspiration. Persistent left lower lobe opacity
concerning for infection or aspiration. Markedly distended,
fluid-filled stomach. Fluid throughout the esophagus. Dobbhoff
catheter coiled
in the stomach. 4.7cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm,
unchanged from [**2132-10-19**]

hypertension.
[**1-20**] CXR: bilat pulmonary opacification, more prominent on the

[**1-20**] KUB: no obstruction


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 80M w/ hx of splenectomy, current perc drainage of
abscess and perc chole, now transferred with ? aspiration event
in addition to tachycardia.  He was kept in the TSICU for close
monitoring.

[**1-21**]: IR removed LUQ drain, pt tolerated trach collar for most of
day, TFs at goal. Elev K+, checked an EKG, no peaked ts.
[**1-22**]: Doing well on TM trials, rest on SIMV, perc chole stitched
in, PICC placed, dobloff placed
.
NEURO: A&Ox3, stable, non focal neuro exam.
.
CVS: Over the course of admission, the patient went into A. fib
with RVR on several occasions, and was treated with an
amiodarone GTT with conversion to sinus rhythm. The amio GTT was
eventually weaned and he was in NSR on Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
EKG showed ST with LBBB (stable). He has been mostly SBP
90s-100s.
.
PULM: During his hospitalization, he initially had to be vented
through his tracheostomy due to respiratory failure, presumed to
be due to an aspiration event (with development of infiltrate as
noted above).  However, he was evenntually weaned to trach
collar during day and on SIMV overnight to rest. He will need
continued Chest PT and mucolytics.
.
GI: CT abdomen pelvis on admission was concerning for SBO w/
transition point. He was managed conservatively with NGT
placement and kept NPO. Bowel activity gradually improved and
repeat KUB during this admission showed no obstruction. TFs were
restarted and advanced to goal with appropriate residuals. Perc
Chole drain in.
.
RENAL: During this hospitalization, his ins and outs were
monitored closely and he was aggressively resuscitated with IVF,
blood and albumin.  At time of dischage, a foley in place, UOP
is adequate. He will need close Cr monitoring for possible
nephrotoxicity (weekly) from antibiotics (colistin).
.
HEME: Hct was stable at dischaged.
.
ENDO: The pt was maintained on ISS during this admission.
.
ID: During this hospitalization, the patient was followed by ID.
 He is being discharge on IV colistin and tigacycline for
complicated pseudomonas. His WBC trended down. Duration of abx
is 14 days.
