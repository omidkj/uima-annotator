Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2137-6-26**] Aortic Valve Replacement(23mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical) and
Two Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(left internal mammary
to left anterior descending with vein graft to diagonal)

History of Present Illness:
This is a 56 year old male with known coronary artery disease
and aortic stenosis. The history of coronary disease dated back
to [**2126**] when he had an Inferior Wall myocardial infarction. At
that time, he received a bare metal stent to the RCA. He
remained stable until [**2134**], when he developed chest pain. Cath
at that time revealed stenosis of the LAD and he received a DES.
In [**2136-11-28**] he was hospitalized and treated for pulmonary
edema. Cardiac cath on [**2137-4-30**] revealed LM and two vessel CAD. He
is also found to have severe AS on echo. He was subsequently
referred for AVR/CABG. Of note, he recently completed a course
of antibiotics for pneumonia. Currently breathing much better.
No fevers, chills, or rigors.

Past Medical History:
-Coronary artery disease s/p IWMI [**2126**] s/p BMS of RCA s/p DES to
LAD [**2134**]
-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, s/p radiation to chest and abdomen [**2113**]
-History of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation dx [**2115**]

Pertinent Results:
[**2137-6-26**] Intraop TEE: Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly
dilated. The left atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There
is [**1-31**]+ mitral regurgitation with calcification of the anterior
mitral leaflet. Jet appears central. There is mild valvular
mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Due to co-existing aortic
regurgitation, the pressure half-time estimate of mitral valve
area [**Known lastname **] be an OVERestimation of true mitral valve area. There
is no pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass: A mechanical prosthesis is seen in the aortic
position (#23 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] per surgeons). On initial seperation from
bypass, a significant paravalvular leak is noted between 9 and
12 o'clock position (where the native non coronary cusp would
have been). Surgeons notified immediately and bypass reiniatied.
On second bypass wean, this jet is no longer present; only
symmetric washing type jets are seen. Peak gradients measure
20-30 mm hg, mean 12-21 mm Hg with cardiac output [**6-4**] Lpm and
systemic pressures of 100-120 systolic. Valve leaflets could not
be visualized due to significant artifacts. MR is now [**12-30**]+.
Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All
findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 116**] was [**6-26**] admitted and underwent a mechanical aortic
valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. For surgical details, please see operative note.
Following surgery, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours, he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated
without incident. He remained in the CVICU receiving aggressive
pulmonary toilet for an additional day and was transferred to
the step-down for on post-op day two. Beta blockers and
diuretics were started and he was diuresed towards his pre-op
weight. Coumadin was initiated for mechanical aortic valve but
INR quickly rose to be supra therapeutic at 5.4. Coumadin was
held, he received vitamin K and INR trended down. Coumadin was
restarted the following day with a gentle titration. On post-op
day four he was transferred back to the CVICU due to rapid
atrial fibrillation with hypotension and no IV access. PICC line
was placed and he was given initially given Cardizem and then
Amiodarone. Rhythm converted back to sinus rhythm and later on
the same day he was transferred back to step-down floor. But he
did continue to have atrial fibrillation/flutter which was
appropriately treated, along with EP consult. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. He developed
bilateral arm phlebitis with elevated white count and was
started on IV antibiotics which was eventually changed to oral.
He will continue antibiotics for 10 days. In addition warm
compresses and ace wraps were applied per vascular consult. Over
the next several days he continued to slowly improve while
working with physical therapy for strength and mobility. In
addition his INR slowly trended up and was therapeutic at
discharge, 2.2. On post-op day 11 he was ready for discharge
home with VNA services and the appropriate medications and
follow-up. MWHC will follow INR and adjust Coumadin accordingly.
