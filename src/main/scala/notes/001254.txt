Cardiac Catheterization: [**2172-9-24**]
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated left
main and 1 vessel disease. The LMCA had a 95% distal stenosis.
The LAD
had minimal luminal irregularities, and D1 40% stenosis. The LCX
had
minimal irregularities. The RCA had a proximal 100% stenosis
with distal
vessel filling via right to right collaterals.
2. Due to differential blood pressure in both arms, left
subclavian
angiogram was performed. It was widely patent.
3. Left ventriculography was defferred.
4. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
systolic and
diastolic pressures. (106/60 mmHg)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Left Main and one vessel coronary artery disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted for cardiac catheterization and found to
have left main and right coronary artery disease. Cardiac
surgery was consulted and he was scheduled for surgery the
following day. He had further angina the night before surgery so
an IABP was placed. He was brought to the operating room on
[**2172-9-25**] for coronary bypass grafting, please see operative report
for details. In summary he had: coronary bypass grafting x3 with
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery,
reverse saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal artery and
reverse saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery. His
bypass time was 81 minutes with a crossclamp time of 59 minutes.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred to the
cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition.  He was transfused
multiple units of packed red blood cells for bleeding in the
immediate post-op period.  He initially required hemodynamic
support with IABP, Levophed and Vasopressin.  Drips and IABP
were weaned and the patient was extubated on POD 2.  He
developed post-op a-fib and was started on amiodarone.  He has a
history of thrombus and coumadin was resumed.  He was noted to
have a small amount of sternal drainage and was started on
Kefzol.  Drainage resolved and he will not be discharged on
antibiotics.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 10 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home with VNA in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.  [**Location (un) 2274**] Post Office Square
will continue to follow coumadin.
