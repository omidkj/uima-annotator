History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 43417**] is a 22 y/o male with PMH notable for recent
traumatic brain injury and C-spine fracture following MVC on
[**2100-9-18**] and RUE DVT who presents with tachycardia, diaphoresis,
tachypnea and hypertension. Of note, he was recently admitted
[**Date range (1) 78922**] at [**Hospital1 18**] following his MVC and is s/p trach and PEG and
was discharged to [**Hospital3 **]. BP on the day of admission at
[**Hospital1 **] was noted to be 170/101, HR 110s, RR 40, O2 98% on
room air. He was noted to be "agitated" and "drenched in sweat."
Straight cath at that time returned 150 cc of urine; he was
started on NS at 75 cc/hour. He was treated with oxycodone due
to concern for inadequate pain control. He was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. Per the patient's father, the
patient's blood pressure since transfer to [**Hospital1 **] from [**Hospital1 18**]
on [**10-26**] has been elevated. Medications were attempted at
[**Hospital1 **] (metoprolol, propanolol) without success.
.
In the ED, initial vitals T 100.4 rectally, BP 169/84, P 88, R
20, O2 100% on trach collar with unknown O2. He received 2 L NS
as well as vancomycin 1 g IV X 1, flagyl 500 IV X 1, and
levofloxacin 750 mg IV X 1. CTA was performed due to concern for
pulmonary embolism given his known RUE DVT; CTA revelaed
bilateral LL opacities concerning for pneumonia. He was admitted
to the MICU on [**10-29**] and has been receiving vanco / [**Last Name (un) 2830**] for HAP.
He has received continued treatment with LMWH for RUE DVT.
Sputum culture on [**10-29**] grew GPC and GN diplocci, awaiting
speciation. Cultures otherwise negative. Neurosurgery and
neurology services are aware of his admission and are following.
He has been receiving propranolol for his autonomic instability
which is thought to be the etiology of his difficult to control
hypertension, tachycardia and low grade temperature.

Past Medical History:
* Traumatic brain injury following MVC in [**9-17**]
* R upper extremity DVT (on fragmin at rehab)
* Recent Klebs oxytoca (pansensitive) and MRSA pneumonia
(finished treatment with linezolid on [**10-23**])

CXR [**11-2**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
major change.  The tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position.
Unchanged atelectatic lung areas in the retrocardiac lung
portions. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. No newly appeared
focal parenchymal opacities suggestive for pneumonia.

change. Tracheostomy tube remains in place. Low lung volumes
with bibasilar atelectasis again seen. Enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette persists. No evidence of acute pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
22 y/o man with recent traumatic brain injury and C-spine
fracture following MVC in [**9-17**], transferred from long term rehab
with fever, tachypnea and tachycardia.
.
Pt was admitted to the MICU on [**10-29**] with hypertension,
tachycardia, and evidence of pneumonia. He was placed on
vancomycin and meropenem for presumed ventilator-associated PNA,
and a sputum culture showed GPCs and GNRs. A CT-Angiogram of the
chest was negative for PE to explain his tachypnea. However, a
RUE U/S showed a RUE clot and pt was started on lovenox 120mg SC
BID. Pt evaluated by neurology on [**11-3**] and felt given persistent
abnormal neuro findings 6 weeks post trauma patient has a very
poor prognosis and minimal chance of meaningful recovery.
Regarding the fevers, cultures of the urine and blood were
negative for infection. In previous admits, ID has felt that his
fevers did NOT have an infectious etiology. The consensus has
been that fever was due to central thermoregulatory dysfunction
given extensive CNS injury.
.
The patient continued to spike fevers and demonstrate autonomic
instability with heart rates ranging from 40s-160s. Blood
pressure would also intermittently spike up to the 200s
systolic, with associated tachycardia and tachypnea (RR>35).
During these episodes pt also noted to be diaphoretic. These
episodes would resolve spontaneously and were most consistent
with CNS insult causing autonomic instability. Of note, the pt
had a with history of previous episodes of HTN and tachypnea
felt related to autonomic instability from neurotrauma.
.
He completed a course of vancomycin and meropenem for a
ventilator associated PNA, and is being d/c'ed to rehab off of
any antibiotics. Was given tylenol prn any fever spikes.
.
For blood pressure and tachycardia control, several new
medications were started and will be uptitrated. These include
propanolol, which was given at 60mg Q6hours, and should be
uptitrated t a max of 80mg q6hours. He was also started on
clonidine 0.1mg tid, and this medication should also be
progressively uptitrated and could eventually be transitioned to
a clonidine patch.
.
For his RUE DVT, pt is on therapeutic lovenox ([**Hospital1 **] dosing) and
should continue for 3-6 months.
.
For his diffuse exonal injury,  no [**Hospital1 65**] mediocation changes were
made from prior admission. Amantadine & skelaxin continued for
rigidity
.
For nutrition, PEG in place - continued TF's per nutrition
recommendations. Access was with a PICC line.
.
This patient has significant autonomic instability followi
