Admission Date:  [**2153-5-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2153-6-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**2078-4-14**]       Sex:  M

Service:  A-Cove

ADDENDUM:  After dictation of the previous Discharge Summary
on [**5-27**], the patient had spiked a fever that night of
[**5-27**].

On [**5-29**] he was noted to have poor oxygen saturations.  A
chest x-ray revealed what was probably and aspiration
pneumonia.  The patient became hypotensive and was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for blood
pressure, airway support, and treatment of aspiration
pneumonia.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was treated
for a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia
with 10 days of vancomycin.  He was intubated for respiratory
distress.  He was maintained on the ventilator for six days,
at which time he self-extubated himself.  Thereafter, he was
oxygenated by 50% oxygen by mask.

At the time he came back to the floor, he was only on 3
liters nasal cannula and was saturating well.  His blood
pressure was very labile while in the Intensive Care Unit and
hypotensive, requiring Levophed for blood pressure support
which was weaned by unit day four.

His hypotensive episode also led to an episode of acute renal
failure, possibly acute tubular necrosis, with his creatinine
climbing to approximately 3.  Again, at the time of transfer
out of the unit, the creatinine was at his baseline.

He continued to be anticoagulated on aspirin and Plavix when
coming out of the unit.  Upon discharge, the Plavix will be
discontinued, and he will be sent on Lovenox because of her
anteroapical myocardial infarction and low ejection fraction.
Coumadin will be started as well, and when therapeutic the
Lovenox will be discontinued.

 1.  Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneous b.i.d.
