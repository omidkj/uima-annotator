Pertinent Results:
[**6-11**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is normal in size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 2. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior, inferolateral and lateral hypokinesis
in the apical to mid segments. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %). 3. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 4.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. 5. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. 6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. A torn
Chordae/chordal [**Male First Name (un) **] is noted. 7. There is no pericardial
effusion.
POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is

He was admitted to the cardiac surgery ICU and appropriately
underwent pre-operative work-up. He was then taken to the
operating room urgently on [**6-11**] where he underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 5. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on op
day he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and
extubated. He was started on beta blockers and diuretics on
post-op day one and transferred to the telemetry floor for
further care. On post-op day two his mediastinal chest tubes
were removed but his left chest tube remained intact d/t
effusion. This was ultimately removed the following day. On
post-op day four his epicardial pacing wires were removed and he
appeared to be doing well. During post-op course he worked with
physical therapy for strength and mobility. He was deemed
suitable for discharged home with VNA services on [**6-15**] and will
make the appropriate follow-up appointments.

To note pt BP on DCwas 100/60. Ace inhibitor and [**Last Name (un) **] not strted
