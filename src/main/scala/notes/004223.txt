Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
hypertensive emergency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 60 y.o.m. with HTN, anxiety, depression,
personality disorder, PTSD, COPD, h/o PE with multiple
admissions for malignant hypertension who is admitted to the ICU
for hyertensive emergency. He was seen in [**Company 191**] today for chest
pain during a regular routine f/u appt. Has had CP for 3 days on
left side, radiating down left arm, unchanged with rest or
exertion. Pressure is constant. Also with 10/10 HA and vision
blurriness as well as photophobia and ataxia/difficulty with
gait. BP was elevated to 210/110 at [**Company 191**], equal in both arms.
Sent to ED for evaluation.

In the ED vitals were 99.3, 66, 192/103, 16, 98%2L. Given
aspirin 325 mg daily, nitro 0.4 mg SL with no relief. Received
one percocet for pain. Head CT negative. Neuro consult did not
find any deficits but inadequate exam because he was
uncooperative and therefore an MRI was recommended which was
negative. EKG without ischemic changes. CTA chest without PE or
aortic dissection. Started on nitro gtt for goal SBP 180 and he
was admitted to the ICU for titration of BP.

Currently the patient is minimially communicative but endorses
chest pain, HA, vision blurriness, and ataxia as above. Also
states that he is anxious and hasn't gotten his clonopin for the
day. Also endorsed nausea, emesis, abdominal discomfort, and
SOB, but unable to elaborate on any of these symptoms. After
this examiner left the room, he voiced a stream of thoughts to
the nurse that included stating he has not had a solid meal
since his girlfriend died a couple of months ago and that he has
been taking his meds intermittently and the reason he showed up
at clinic today was to get meds refilled as he had run out

of anterior and posterior circulation. The distal left vertebral
artery ends in posterior inferior cerebellar artery, a normal
variation. There is no vascular occlusion or stenosis seen.
There is no evidence of an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 60 y.o.m. with HTN and multiple admissions for
malignant hypertension, anxiety, depression, PTSD, COPD who
presents with hypertensive emergency with signs of end organ
damage.

# Malignant Hypertension ?????? Etiology mednoncompliance. Workup in
the past has been negative to identify causes other than
essential hypertension. No evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage
or infarcts. [**Month (only) 116**] have hypertensive encephalopathy which is
characterized by HA, nausea, and vomiting, but the brain MRI did
not show any evidence of edema. Other neurologic symptoms such
as vision blurriness and ataxia, as well as cardiac symtpoms of
chest pain and [**Last Name (un) **] are likely the result of hypertension and end
organ damage.  He was started on nitro gtt with goal SBP<160.
He was then switched to metoprolol, amlodipine, and clondine PO.
 He has a history of non-compliance, and clondine can cause
rebound hypertension.  His BP was well controlled on discharge.
Patient instructed in importance of taking his meds faithfully.

# Chest pain - Patient with risk factors including hypertension
and h/o tobacco in the past as well as family history. No
hypercholesteremia or diabetes. EKG and story not c/w ACS. CTA
without PE or aortic dissection. Reproducible on exam. Likely
due to costrochondritis as well as hypertensive emergency.  3
sets of cardiac enzymes were negative.  Patient was continued on
aspirin and b-blocker.

# [**Last Name (un) **] - Cr mildly elevated at 1.3, likely due to malignant
hypertension. Was elevated to 1.6 during last admission with
similar presentation.

# COPD - Currently stable.
- Continue tiatroprium and fluticasone

# H/O PE - Treated with lovenox. IVC filter in place. No
evidence of recurrent PE.


# Psych - Ah/o depression, anxiety, PTSD, personality disorder.
Also homeless. Psych consult recommended current psych meds, no
evidence of active suicidal ideation.
