History of Present Illness:
54 yo woman with a PMH significant for DVT/PE, aortic atheroma
c/b SMA embolization requiring bowel resection who presented to
[**Hospital 47255**] with a 1 day h/o acute, sharp left flank pain.
The patient had recently been taken off Warfarin for a rectus
sheath hematoma. She was in her USOH until the morning prior to
presentation when she woke from sleep with 10/10 sharp, L sided
flank pain. The pain started on her left side, with some
radiation to her back. The pain was somewhat colicky, but mostly
constant and sharp. The pain was somewhat relieved by sitting
upright, but had few alleviating or exacerbating factors. The
patient presented to [**Hospital 47255**] where she was given
Dilaudid and Zofran. A CT abdomen was done that showed a left
renal artery infarct. The patient was transfered to our ED for
more acute care. In the ED, the patient's VS: 98.5 84 139/85 20
98% 2L. A CTA was repeated that once again showed
non-enhancement of the left upper pole of the left kidney c/w
renal infarct. The patient was given Levaquin and Vanco for
leukocytosis and fever. The patient was seen by Vascular surgery
and IR and started on a heparin gtt before being transfered to
the floor for further management.

On the floor, the patient's VS 99.7, 124/88, 86, 18, 97% RA. The
patient was still with 10/10 left sided pain with radiation to
her back and abdomen. The patient is still making urine, no
gross blood. Otherwise, the patient's condition is unchanged.

PERTINENT STUDIES
CTA Abd/pelvis [**11-14**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Non-enhancement of portions of the renal parenchyma involving
the left
upper pole, large portions of the lateral and anterior mid
kidney consistent with renal infarct. No obvious filling defect
within the left renal artery to suggest thrombus.
2. Stable-sized rectal sheath hematoma and intra-abdominal
extraperitoneal
hematoma.
3. Stable-appearing paraumbilical hernia containing colon.

ECHO [**11-15**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Study inadequate to exclude a patent foramen ovale.

L upper extremity ultrasound [**11-18**]:
LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: The left internal jugular vein
could not be visualized on axial images for compression
maneuvers. On sagittal images, the vein appears diminutive but
patent.

Catheter is identified in the left subclavian vein, without
surrounding thrombus. There is normal compressibility, flow, and
augmentation in the bilateral subclavian and left axillary,
brachial, basilic and cephalic veins. There is diffuse
subcutaneous edema.
IMPRESSION:
1. No left upper extremity DVT.
2. Diffuse subcutaneous edema.

L lower extremity ultrasound [**11-19**]:
[**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler images of the right and left common
femoral, left
superficial femoral, popliteal and proximal calf veins were
obtained. There
was wall-to-wall flow with normal response to compression and
augmentation in all visible veins. The popliteal artery is
superficial to the popliteal vein.
IMPRESSION:
No DVT or fluid collections in left lower extremity.

MICROBIOLOGY:
Blood culture [**11-14**]: negative

Brief Hospital Course:
54 year-old woman with a history of DVT and PE on warfarin who
was also on aspirin and cilostazol for PVD recently had been
taken off warfarin for a rectus sheath hematoma presents with
left renal infarction confirmed by CTA of abdomen and pelvis.
Whether the renal infarct was caused by embolism or thrombosis
is unknown. Hematology and vascular surgery consults were
obtained. She was started on heparin gtt. Subsequently, she had
a drop in hematocrit 36.6-->31.9 and was hypotensive, so was
transferred to the MICU for concern of active bleeding.  She
received 2 units of PRBCs. Repeat CT abdomen did not show any
enlargement of rectus sheath hematoma.  Hematocrit stabilized
and patient was transferred back to the floor.

She was continued on heparin gtt until her INR was therapeutic.
The decision was made to not restart aspirin or cilostazol for
PVD for now given her recent spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma.
 Hematocrit was stable for 3 days at a level of about 36.

PROBLEM LIST:
# [**Name2 (NI) 2325**] renal infarct: Patient presented from [**Hospital3 **] with
diagnosis of left renal infarct, which was confirmed on CTA of
abdomen and pelvis. It remains unclear whether the infarct of
the left renal artery is from an embolic source or is
thrombotic.  Both hematology and vascular surgeries were
consulted.  Of note, prior coagulation workup has been negative
for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin,
anti-beta2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies and factor V leiden were
negative. Pt has an atheroma at the descedning aorta right
beneath the aortic arch, which was considered as possible
embolic source. She was continued on simvastatin. Heparin gtt
was continued until INR therapeutic.  Dilaudid PO was used for
pain.

# Anticoagulation: given her extensive his
