Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9002**]
Chief Complaint:
DOE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
N/A

History of Present Illness:
66 year old woman with metastatic (lung, liver, bone)
endometrial adenocarcinoma that has been refractory to multiple
chemotherapeutic agents, CM/CHF (EF 20%) s/p ICD, BiV pacer,
Afluter/Atrial fibrillation, CKD, HTN, OSA with recent change in
her code status how now presents with worsening DOE, malaise,
tachypnea, air hunger, unable to speak in full sentences to the
ED.  She is on home O2 of [**3-12**] L NC.

She was apparently in USOH until 2 weeks ago, when she began to
experience increasing SOB, in setting of anxity episodes. Family
reports increasing weight and LE edema in setting of not
elevating her LEs.  They have also noted a cough, productive of
white/yellow sputum over the past few weeks, though per patient
this has been unchanged for several months.  There have been no
recent changes in her medications.  She has not had other
infectious symptoms.  She c/o of chronic insomnia and often of
anxiety w/ episodes of dyspnea.

She only recently, 6mo ago, started using BiPAP regularly, which
has
been uncomfortable for her.  There have been no recent changes
in her medications.  At time of interview on the floor, she
denies CP, diaphoresis, fever, night sweats but has occasional
chills.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.8 77 116/65 20 100 on 6 LNC.  She
was started on BiPAP, EKG showed LVH (apparently unchanged from
prior). She was started on nitro gtt, was given lasix 80mg IV x1
(UOP ~ 200cc), Vancomycin 1g, Cefepime 2g and Levofloxacin 500mg
for suspected PNA (CXR w/ volume overload and "unable to r/o LLL
PNA."
.
Of note, during [**2105-7-2**] meeting with Oncology ([**Doctor Last Name 6401**]/
[**Doctor Last Name **]) after a discussion regarding an incurable
nature of her cancer and her refractoriness to treatments a
recommendation was not to pursue further chemotherapy as her
"numerous medical comorbidities would preclude her participation
in any ongoing clinical trials" a decision was made to pursue
hospice care. Patient remained in hospice care until [**2105-7-22**]
when she reversed her code status to full after a discussion
with her other two sons (recently arrived to help take care of
her and hospice nursing staff).  Apparently her major concern
re: intubation had been fear of not being sedated, once it was
explained to her that she would be sedated, she agreed to
intubation and resuscitation.  She apparently was able to
communicate her understanding of difficulty with extubation, but
would like to defer that decision to her children once she is
intubated and can not be extubated.

Of note, on last discharge from [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for HF ([**2105-5-25**]), her
weight was 136.9kg with Cr of 1.5.

Blood Culture x 2, (Final [**2105-8-1**]): NO GROWTH.
Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2105-7-28**]):

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2105-7-31**]): NO GROWTH.
.
IMAGING
.
Chest x-ray ([**2105-7-26**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Low lung volumes with persistent and possibly worsened
central pulmonary
vascular congestion, with blurring of the vascular borders,
concerning for
CHF. Enlarged cardiac silhouette persists.
2. Multiple pulmonary nodules, consistent with metastatic
disease, better
assessed on CT.
.
Chest x-ray ([**2105-8-4**]):
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-29**], there is a
little overall change. The multiple metastatic nodules are again
seen throughout both lungs in a patient with substantial
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and a pacemaker device in
place. It is very difficult to evaluate the pulmonary
vascularity, though there does not appear to be frank pulmonary
edema. Areas of opacification at the bases have apparently
decreased since the prior study.
.
Renal ultrasound ([**2105-8-2**]):
IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound.
.
EKG: Sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay. Left ventricular
hypertrophy with secondary repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2105-5-21**] findings are
similar.
