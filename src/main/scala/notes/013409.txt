History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year-old woman with h/o metastatic breast
cancer (mets to brain and bone, currently receiving radiation tx
with radiosensitizing platinum and trastuzumab, received dose of
cisplatin yesterday), hypogammaglobulinemia (on prophylactic
doxy), h/o recurrent aspiration pneumonia, HTN, HLD, transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH for pneumonia.  Yesterday patient had
chemotherapy (low dose cisplatin).  She was complaining of
productive cough and low grade fevers (99) over the past several
days.  Last night she called her daughter at 1:30 AM and was
asking for help.  Her daughter could not make sense of what she
was saying and she seemed confused.  When her daughter saw her
she was rigoring, coughing up pink/red-tinged sputm and was
vomiting.  Her temperature was 101.9.  Her daughter gave her 1
gram tylenol, zofran, and compazine and called 911. Patietn
became increasingly confused when EMS arrived. Patient was
initially seen at [**Hospital 11066**] Hospital where initial vitals were
102.7, 141/79, 117, 18, 82% on RA.  She was found to have a
pneumonia on CXR.  OSH labs were significant for a Na of 149,
creatinine of 0.9, lactate of 1.6.  She received one zosyn 3.375
mg x1, 4 mg zofran, 500 cc NS bolus, and 8 mg morphine.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continuity of care.  En route, patient
became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures ranging 70s -
90s.

Of note, patient was admitted from [**2121-8-16**] - [**2121-8-19**] for fever,
which was thought to be secondary to cellulitis.  Per discharge
summary patient was treated with vancomycin IV and was then
transitioned to bactrim at discharge.

In the ED, initial vital signs were 98.6 100 75/? 24 92% 2L.
Exam was significant for hypoxia, hypotension, and lethargy.
CXR showed LLL pneumonia.  She had a bedside ultrasound showing
IVC with > 50% collapse, FAST negative.  Patient received 2L of
IVF and her blood pressure improved to systolics in the 90s.
Patient received clindamycin 600 mg IV x1 to cover for MRSA
pneumonia as she has a vancomycin allergy.  As per ED, patient
initially looked like she may need intubation, but she improved
while in the ED and did not need intubation.  Vitals on transfer
94/55 92 18 100% on non-rebreather.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's blood pressure is 89/58, HR
93, RR 22, O2 Sat 100% on NRB.  Patient is lethargic and cannot
participate in history or ROS.

Review of systems:
Patient is lethargic and cannot participate in ROS.
