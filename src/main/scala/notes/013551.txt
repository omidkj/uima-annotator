Chief Complaint:
Decreased responsiveness, L thalamic/BG bleed

PEG placement
Tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
78 year old RH male with a history of COPD, asthma, CHF, and
Afib who this morning at 7am, got up to go use the bedside
urinal while his wife and downstairs and she heard a grunting
sound.  She went upstairs and found him on the ground.  When she
told him she was going to call 911, he was mumbling "no, no" and
pointing to the bed. Since she couldn't get him into bed, she
went to get her two sons at home. The sons got to the bedroom
and noticed that he wasn't moving his right side and had a right
facial droop.
.
He was taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital where on CT scan he was found
to have a 3 cm left basal ganglia bleed with intraventricular
hemorrhage.  His INR was found to be 2.4 and he was given 2
units of FFP and Vitamin K 10mg.  He was combative and not
responding to questions, so he was intubated and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**]. At arrival here, repeat head CT showed a 4.5 cm basal
ganglia bleed with intraventricular hemorrhage and small amount
of midline shift.  His INR is 1.8.

Past Medical History:
Chronic asthma
CHF
Afib on Coumadin (INR 2 weeks ago was 2.4)
bilateral cataracts
COPD
"nervousness."
PCP is [**Name9 (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) 73983**]

Social History:
Used to work in a leather factory, smoked 3ppd x 45 years but
quit 12 years ago, no alcohol or other drug use.

Family History:
Mom fractured her leg, was hospitalized and passed away at the
hospital.  Dad had a stroke at 85 and passed away a few years
later.

Head CT [**7-7**]:
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is a large hyperdense focus
within the left thalamus consistent with acute hemorrhage with
associated edema.  This focus measures approximately 4.4 x 3.5
cm. In addition, there is hyperdense material within the
occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, left greater than
right consistent with hemorrhage.
Bilateral maxillary sinus mucosal thickening.  Fluid within the
ethmoid cells. Mucosal thickening of the sphenoid sinuses.
IMPRESSION:
1.  4.4 x 3.5 cm left thalamic hemorrhage.
2.  Intraventricular hemorrhage occupying the occipital horns of
the lateral ventricles, left greater than right.

Repeat Head CT [**7-8**]:
FINDINGS:  There is redemonstration of the large hemorrhage
situated within the left lentiform nucleus, left internal
capsule and thalamus with
intraventricular hemorrhage, largely within the left lateral
ventricle but
also layering in the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].  There is a moderate
amount of
edema surrounding the hemorrhage within the basal ganglia
region.  Overall, there has been negligible interval change in
the appearance of the scan compared to the study obtained
approximately 13 hours prior to the present study.
CONCLUSION:  Stable, abnormal study as noted above.

CT C spine [**7-7**]:
1) No evidence of acute cervical spine fracture.
2) Findings consistent with DISH (diffuse idiopathic skeletal
hyperostosis).
3) Two well-corticated fragments posterior to the spinous
processes of C6 and C7 likely relate to old trauma or additional
enthesopathy.
4) Hemorrhage within the occipital horns of the lateral
ventricles better demonstrated on the prior head CT.

EEG [**7-16**]: Abnormal portable EEG due to the persistently slow
background. This indicates a widespread encephalopathy.
Medications,
metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common
causes.
Hypoxia and low flow states are also possible explanations.
There were
no areas of prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may
mask focal
findings. There were no epileptiform features.

NCHCT [**7-16**]: There is persistence of a large hemorrhage situated
within the left lentiform nucleus, left internal capsule, and
thalamus with intraventricular spread layering in the occipital
horns bilaterally. Overall there is likely more edema compared
to [**7-8**] and approximately 7-mm of rightward subfalcine
herniation slightly also larger compared to prior. No new
intracranial hemorrhage is identified and no new abnormal
extra-axial fluid collection is seen.

Surrounding osseous structures are unremarkable. Mild ethmoid
and maxillary sinus mucosal thickening with more extensive
sphenoid sinus thickening is noted. There is persistent near
complete opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally. The
findings are likely inflammatory in origin.

IMPRESSION: Persistent left basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage
with slightly increased edema and rightward subfalcine
herniation.

RUQ U/S [**7-20**]:
1. Limited right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrates no
evidence of acute cholecystitis. There is a moderate amount of
sludge within the gallbladder.
2. Large cystic structure within the right kidney incompletely
evaluated on this examination.

ECHO [**7-22**]: Preserved global biventricular systolic function. No
definite
cardiac source of embolism, valvular pathology, or pathologic
flow
identified.

CXR [**7-23**]: Stable chest findings in patient with tracheostomy and
status post ganglion hemorrhage.

CT Sinus [**7-23**]: Compared with the prior CT scan of [**7-16**],
there is now only moderate left and minimal right-sided sphenoid
air cell mucosal thickening. There is very minimal mucosal
thickening along the medial wall of the left maxillary sinus.
The ethmoid and frontal sinuses are normally pneumatized.
However, there remains essentially total loss of aeration of the
left mastoid sinus complex, including the left mastoid antrum,
aditus ad antrum, and left epitympanic recess. The right mastoid
sinus complex is incompletely encompassed on the available axial
scans. There appears to be slightly less opacification at this
time in this locale. The right epitympanic recess as well as
aditus ad antrum and right mastoid antrum appeared to be
normally aerated. Please note that the reconstructed images do
not encompass the mastoid sinuses, as the requested examination
was a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses.
CONCLUSION: Somewhat less extensive paranasal sinus mucosal
thickening. Please see above report with regard to the mastoid
sinuses.
COMMENT: Of course, this study does not constitute an optimal
protocol for brain imaging, but th
