History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 81 year-old woman with a history of multiple
myeloma,
thrombocytopenia, anemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, high
cholesterol,
hypothyroidism transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with
large left intracerebral hemorrhage.

Patient was found on floor near bed by husband on night of [**3-8**].
Patient was arousable, and husband was able to get her back in
to bed. All day [**2132-3-9**] patient became progressively worse, with
increasing confusion and slurred speech as well as difficulty

to person. Her right pupil was 4mm, left 2mm, had a weak right
grip, ?right facial droop, slurred speech, blood glucose in
170s. Also with evidence of vomitus.

Patient then brought to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital. There, GCS was
4 (actively resisted eye opening) and she was intubated with
etomidate and succinylcholine. Head CT showed very large left
intracerebral hemorrhage, small left subdural hemorrhage. Pt
given mannitol and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Was given
more paralytics for transfer.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], GCS 3. Given 1gm dilantin. Had SBP in
160s-170s. Was started on labetalol gtt very briefly, but
dropped SBP to 80s so labetalol discontinued.

-----
CT scan of the cervical spine [**2132-3-10**]: No fracture or
malalignment of the cervical vertebral bodies are demonstrated.
Mild multilevel degenerative changes are noted, with most
evident changes noted at C4-C5 with mild narrowing of the
intervertebral disc space, vacuum degeneration, endplate
irregularities, and osteophytic spurring. Vacuum degeneration of
the C2/3 disc is also noted. A shallow posterior disc protrusion
is seen at C5-C6. There is probable degenerative calcification
along the undersurface of the atlantodental articulation. The
visualized outline of thecal sac is unremarkable. An
endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are demonstrated within
the trachea and esophagus respectively. Visualized lung apices
are clear. Prominent calcifications of the common carotid
bifurcations are noted, atherosclerotic in origin.
IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment. Multilevel degenerative
changes.
-----
CT head without contrast [**2132-3-10**]: Extensive hemorrhage is
demonstrated within the left frontal and left temporal lobes
with marked mass effect and edema, with left to right subfalcine
herniation and uncal/hippocampal herniation, with prominent
brainstem compression at the incisura. This hemorrhage measures
approximately, 6.0 x 8.5 cm in greatest axial dimensions. There
is extention of blood products into both lateral ventricles with
blood noted layering within the occipital horns. The temporal
horns appear dilated. A small amount of hemorrhage is also seen
in the third and fourth ventricles. A small left frontal
subdural hemorrhage is also demonstrated. Mild amount of fluid
and mucosal thickening is demonstrated within ethmoid and
sphenoid sinuses bilaterally. The remaining visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are well pneumatized. Surrounding
osseous and soft tissue structures are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION:
Extensive hemorrhage within the left frontal and left temporal
lobes, with marked surrounding edema and mass effect, left to
right subfalcine herniation, uncal/hippocampal herniation, and
intraventricular hemorrhagic extension. Small left subdural
hemorrhage is also noted. Underlying mass lesion cannot be fully
excluded. Temporal horns are dilated.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 81 year old female with multiple myeloma,
thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, high
cholesterol, and congestive heart failure who was found by
husband on floor next to bed night of [**3-8**]. She then had slowly
worsening mental status during day and by [**2132-3-9**] was confused
with slurred speech. When she began only speaking "gibberish"
husband called EMS.

At outside hospital had GCS 4 and was intubated. Head CT with
large left intracerebral hemorrhage with small left subdural
hemorrhage. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Here, repeat head CT looked worse with 6x8 cm left
temporal/parietal/frontal bleed with ~2cm midline shift,
subfalcine and uncal herniation. Also, small left subdural
hemorrhage. Exam in am on [**2132-3-10**] showed pupils dilated R>L and
non-reactive, no corneals, no gag, no nasal grimace and only
mild extensor posturing to pain. She was evaluated by
Neurosurgery, who did not feel operative intervention was
warranted given poor prognosis.

She was initially managed with medical supportive care. Got 1gm
dilantin in ED. Also got mannitol at outside hospital. Here, we
continuined mannitol at 50 mg IV q6h. She was transfused
platelets for platelet count of 43. Sedating and paralytic
medications were avoided.

The gravity of the patient's clinical situation was discussed in
team meeting with her family. At that point, family opted to
change focus of care to comfort measures only. [**Location (un) 511**] Organ
Bank was notified. Patient was extubated at around 14:30 on
[**2132-3-10**] and expired at 14:53 [**2132-3-10**]. Family notified
immediately.
