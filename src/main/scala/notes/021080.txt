Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74762**] had a history of a pancreatic pseudocyst which had
been drained on his most recent admission here at the [**Hospital1 18**] (for
details of the admission, please reference discharge summary).
He was transferred from the [**Hospital3 **] Center on
[**2100-8-27**] with a history of a morbiliform rash that started the
day prior to admission, fevers (102.0 at the Rehab Ctr., 103.6
in the ED here), tachycardic to the 130s in Atrial fibrillation,
and hypotensive (SBP~80s, MAPs40-50).  The patient's family was
adamant that he was DNR/DNI.  He was transferred to the ICU from
the ED that same day and pressors were started in addition to
continuing with IV fluid resuscitation; antibiotics were
continued.  Dermatology was consulted for concerns of his rash
and recommended that his imipenem be changed to meropenem which
was done.  The patient continued to be in critical condition and
his condition continued to deteriorate.  On Sunday, [**2100-8-29**], the
patient was made CMO by his family.  He was started on a
morphine drip early on the morning of [**2100-8-30**] and expired at
09:25 later that same morning. The family has requested an
autopsy.
