History of Present Illness:
64 yo male with Hx of CAD s/p NSTEMI, severe COPD with multiple
intubations on chronic steroids who was recently discharged on
[**2103-8-13**] after a flare now being admitted for hypercarbic
respiratory failure and hypotension. Pt was recently
hospitalized for similar presentation on [**2103-8-4**] for which he
was intubated for 3 days and treated with an 8 day course of
Ceftazadime for pseudomonas that grew from his sputum and
Vancomycin for suspected sepsis for 3 days. He also breifly
required Norepinephrine for hypotension although all blood
cultures and Urine cultures remained negative. He now presents
from with home after waking up acutely short of breath. He
reports feeling well after discharge but was having difficulty
last night sleeping and decided to take Ambien 5mg which has
worked well for him in the past. He awoke 4 hours later with
shortness of breath. He attempted using his albuterol nebulizer
with minimal response and decided to call EMS. He denied any
cough, sputum production, fever, chills or increasing SOB
leading up to this episode. He denied any chest pain, chest
tightness or palpitations.
.
In the ED he was started on bipap with ABG of 7.35/58/265
although no initial ABG obtained. He was initially hypertensive
and tachycardix with BP of 200/100 and HR 140 but became
hypotensive after starting BIPAP mask. He was started on
Ceftazadime and vancomycin due to hx of Pseudomonas in sputum
and MRSA PNA in the past. He was also given IV solumedrol for
COPD exacerbation. His SBP was mildly improved after 1L IVF so
sepsis protocol was not initiated.
.
On transfer from [**Name (NI) 153**] pt reports that he is breathing much, much
better than on admission, feels that the majority of his
symptoms were exacerbated by the heat and humidity.  Feels that
he will be ready to go home soon, after another day or so.
Wants to get out of bed and walk more.  Pt has been off
antibiotics, and has been transitioned to PO steroids.  O2
requirement is 4L currently, which is his home level.  Pt is
very pleased with how things are going.  No F/C, no N/V, no
CP/SOB, no dysuria, no BRBPR/melena.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with good systolic
function. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient was admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypercarbic respiratory distress, although the ABG
obtained in the ED suggested that the patient had good response
to noninvasive ventilation.  There was no sign of pneumonia on
CXR, and no evidence of increased sputum production to suggest
bronchitis or bronchiectasis.  Pt was placed on Prednisone 60mg
with plans for a slow taper.  It was felt the the acute nature
of this episode's onset was concerning for CHF in the setting of
ischemia.  Even though he has no CAD on cath in [**4-10**], he does
have a hx of NSTEMI representing possible troponin leak from
diastolic dysfunction and subendocardial ischemia.  The initial
ECG on admission suggested rt heart strain but this is not
unexpected in the setting of the patient's known pulmonary
disease. Cardiac enzymes were obtained x3 and were negative.
The patient was observed overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where good O2
sats were observed on 4L by NC, along with neb treatments and
prednisone.  A TTE was obtained that showed no evidence of new
CHF.  The patient was transferred to the general medical floor,
where he remained stable and by self-report was near or at his
baseline.  The patient did note exercise intolerance [**2-7**] air
hunger, but stated that this was not proportionally different
from his USOH PTA.  The patient received a total of 3 days of
Prednisone 60mg, and was then decreased to 40mg on the day of
discharge.  The patient was given instructions for a very slow
taper that would bring him to no less than 20mg per day of
prednisone by the time Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] saw the patient later in
the month.  PCP prophylaxis was considered by the attending
given the length of the prednisone taper, but was decided
against.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] recommended BiPAP overnight, and this
was started and titrated by respiratory care to settings of
[**12-11**].  The patient tolerated this overnight without significant
problems.  The patient had been given a BiPAP machine roughly 6
months ago from his home health agency, but he had not been
using it due to what he calls 'incorrect settings'.  Eventually
they took it back from him.  In order for him to re-qualify for
reimbursement for BiPAP, Medicare requires documentation of an
ABG with a PCO2 greater than 55 (which this patient has many of)
and
