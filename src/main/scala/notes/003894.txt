Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, rash

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
catheter exchange [**5-10**] and [**2126-5-17**]
ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13275**] is a 65 yo M who presented on day +27 status post
non-myeloblative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant
for myelofibrosis with weakness and a rash.  He reports that he
had been feeling well at the time of discharge on [**2126-4-29**] but
had become progressively weaker in the interval.  Three days
prior to presentation the patient first noted a decrease in his
energy, and over the previous two days he was so weak he could
not even stand for a few minutes.  This was associated with some
dizziness with standing, which was without sensation of movement
or vertiginous features.  He also reported that his rash had
worsened despite an increase in prednisone with mild pruritus.
Cough had also developed on the day of presentation, which was
productive of clear phlegm.   He denied dysuria, fevers, chills,
diarrhea, nausea or abdominal pain.  At presentation he did
endorse a mild [**1-12**] headache that was dull and not associated
with photophobia, nausea or neck stiffness.  He denied
palpitations or dyspnea.  His chronic low back pain is at
baseline, dull, [**3-12**], and not associated with leg weakness,
saddle anesthesia or bowel/bladder incontinence. He did report
constipation x 4 days. He had noted some decrease in appetite
but was unsure regarding weight loss.

On the day of presentation the patient was seen in clinic and
found to be orthostatic from 141/93 to 119/80 with symptoms. He
received 2 L NS, and had labs drawn including cultures. He was
admitted to the BMT sertvice to further work up his weakness and
rash. His dizziness improved after IVF.

ROS: Positive per HPI and otherwise essentially negative. The pt
denied recent fevers, night sweats, chills, changes in hearing
or vision, including amaurosis fugax, neck stiffness,
lymphadenopathy, hematemesis, coffee-ground emesis, dysphagia,
odynophagia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, steatorrhea,
melena, hematochezia, cough, hemoptysis, wheezing, shortness of
breath, chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion,
increasing lower extremity swelling, orthpnea, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, leg pain while walking, joint pain.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY
====================
Diagnosed with primary myelofibrosis (w/ JAK2 mutation) in

cyclosporine dose increased

OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
=============================
- Epistaxis

stress test 8 yrs ago; stress test with imaging in [**2123**] showed a
small area of mild distal inferior apical ischemia. He had a
radionucleotide stress test recently, however, that stratified
him to low risk.)
- Hypertension
- Chronic Low Back Pain, found by MRI to have spinal stenosis
and disc disease
- History of leg edema of unclear etiology

gene; His baseline ferritin in [**1-11**] was 970)


Social History:
He is married with four children and 10 grandchildren. He works
as a cement finisher and also ploughs snow in the winter. He has
an 80 pkyr smoking history, having quit 11 years prior to
admission. He drinks 2-3 alcoholic beverages per week.

PATHOLOGY
=========
Skin Biopsy [**2126-5-10**]:
DIAGNOSIS:
1.     Skin, right lateral eyebrow (A,B):
    Squamous cell carcinoma, well to moderately differentiated
and invasive; extends to the peripheral and to the deep specimen
margins.
2.     Skin, left medial canthus (C,D):
    Basal cell carcinoma, superficial and nodular types with
superficial excoriation and squamous differentiation; extends to
the peripheral and to the deep specimen margins.

Skin Biopsy [**2126-5-13**]:
DIAGNOSIS:
Skin, left abdomen, punch biopsy (A):
    Vacuolar interface dermatitis with satellite cell necrosis
and scattered eosinophils (see note).
    Note: The findings raise a histologic differential diagnosis
that includes acute graft versus host disease and a drug
eruption.  Clinical correlation is required.

GI Biopsies [**2126-5-15**]:
DIAGNOSIS:
Colonic mucosal biopsies:
A.  Descending:
    1.  Features consistent with involvement by acute graft vs.
host disease; see note.
    2.  No viral inclusions identified on immunostain for CMV.
B.  Sigmoid:
    1.  Features consistent with involvement by acute graft vs.
host disease; see note.
    2.  No viral inclusions identified on immunostain for CMV.
C.  Rectum:
    1.  Features consistent with involvement by acute graft vs.
host disease; see note.
    2.  No viral inclusions identified on immunostain for CMV.
Note: The biopsies demonstrate focally prominent crypt
apoptoses, rare crypt abscess, and focal cryptitis with only a
mild associated mixed inflammatory infiltrate, consistent with
involvement by acute GVHD.  Foci of crypt drop-out are
identified. While CMV immunostains are negative for viral
inclusions, a concomitant infectious process cannot be entirely
excluded.
