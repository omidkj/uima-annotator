Pertinent Results:
[**8-20**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant system
demonstrated 3 vessel diseased. The LMCA had mild plaquing. The
LAD had
80% ostial stenosis with a total occlusion in the mid portion of
the
vessel. Collaterals from the acute marginal of the RCA filled
with
distal LAD. The Cx had a 90% stenosis of the ostium and an 80%
stenosis
in the mid portion of the vessel. The OM2 branch of the Cx had a
total
occlusion. The RCA had a total occlusion in the mid portion of
the
vessel. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a central
aortic pressure of 133/97 mmHg. 3. Successful PTCA of the acute
OM2 occlusion with a 2.0mm balloon with 50% residual stenosis.
[**8-21**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis
<40%.
[**8-22**] Echo: Pre CPB: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. There is an inferobasal left
ventricular aneurysm. There is akiniesis of the inferior wall
and hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 20 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was
notified in person of the results.
Post CPB: On infusions of epi, levophed, milrinone, amiodarone,
and while AV pacing, improved global LV systolic function, LVEF
now 30%, with improvement of anterior & lateral walls. MR is now
trace, IABP is 5 cm below the left subclavian artery. Aortic
contour is normal post- decanulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 84490**] was transferred for a cardiac catheterization. Cath
revealed severe three vessel disease and he underwent PTCA of
the second obtuse marginal. The following day he developed
recurrent ischemia and underwent placement of an IABP. He was
stabilized and on [**8-22**] he was brought to the operating room
where he underwent an coronary artery bypass graft x 4. Please
see operative report for surgical details.

He weaned from bypass on epinephrine, Levophed, Milrinone and
the IABP. He had a significant fluid requirement and Vasopressin
was added to his regimen to stabilize his hemodynamics. He
gradually improved and on POD 2 with lower Levophed and
epinephrine requirements the IABP was removed without incident.
Chest tubes were removed. He did have transient atrial
fibrillation which responded nicely to Amiodarone with
conversion to sinus rhythm. All above drugs were weaned off by
post-op day three. Ace-inhibitor was started for pre-op
myocardial infarction. Also on this day he was weaned off
sedation, awoke neurologically intact but very confused and
extubated. Tube feedings were begun earlier and continued.
Diuresis was begun. Captopril was changed to Lisinopril and
Coreg given due to his poor left ventricular function. On POD 6
he was able to swallow thick foods without difficulty and tube
feeds were stopped. He was oriented to events, more alert
although slightly still confused.

On POD 7 he was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
care. Physical and Occupational therapy worked with him for
conditioning and strength. They recommended additional
rehabilitation. Coumadin was started per cardiologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] for low EF (titrate for INR around 2). An
echocardiogram was performed on [**9-1**] to evaluate his
post-operative ejection fraction. Later on this day he was
discharged to rehab with the appropriate medications and
follow-up appointments.
