Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**]
Chief Complaint:
GIB, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2183-2-2**] endoscopic biliary stent replacement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28221**] is a 62yo M with PMH CAD s/p CABG in [**11/2182**],
diastolic congestive heart failure, ESRD on HD since [**12/2182**]
Tu,Th,Sat, history of DVT & PE (previously on Coumadin), recent
C. diff colitis, who is transferred from the OSH for melena with
duodenal ulcer seen on EGD likely [**2-27**] to mechanical injury from
the metal stent in the biliary tract that may require
intervention.
.
At the OSH inital vitals prior to transfer were BP 134/63 HR 87
RR 20 Temp 98.6. He was noted by nursing notes to be A&Ox2, on
60% mask, RR 17 with O2 sat 98%. He presented to [**Hospital3 **]
after melena at [**Hospital **] rehab that began on [**2183-1-29**]. He was noted
to have melena with drop in his Hct, and had INR 4, and was
given Vitamin K, in addition to 2 units PRBC's. He continued to
have melena, and was given 2 more units PRBC's prior to transfer
to [**Hospital3 **]. On admission to [**Hospital1 3597**] on [**2182-1-31**] his WBC was
15.9 with 87% PMN's, Hct 26.3, plts 174, INR 1.7, PTT 38, Na
139, K 5.2, Cl 98, HCO3 29, BUN 26, Cr 2.5, Gluc 202. CK 23 trop
0.09, BNP 4982. CXR there reported as mild pulmonary vascular
congestion and possible interstitial edema.
He was placed on protonix gtt for GIB there, transfused 1 unit
PRBC's. He had an EGD that found a stent in the second portion
of the duodenum and an ulcer in the second portion of the
duodenum. The ulcer was injected with Epi and cauterized, with
cessation of bleednig. Surgery was consulted there, and
recommended removal of the stent and consideration of IVC filter
placement given recent bleed and history of DVT's. However,
given the EGD findings with stent migration, he was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**]. Also at [**Hospital1 3597**], he was
thought to be in diastolic heart failure, with poor response to
lasix, and had 3.5L fluid removal with HD on [**2-1**].
.
Today at [**Hospital3 **] in the morning prior to transfer he had
a fever to 100.3, and was found to have WBC to 30 up from 14,
with 27 bands. He was given Vancomycin 1gm at 10am, Zosyn 2.25gm
IV x1 at 10am, metronidazole 500mg IV at 10am.
.
Pt has had complicated course over the past year. He had stent
placed to common bile duct in [**2182-7-26**] for stricture thought to
be due to CCY in [**2174**]. Since then, he has had multiple
admissions, mostly at [**Doctor First Name 9464**]. He had CAD s/p CABG in [**11/2182**],
which was complicated by HCAP, treated with zosyn. That
hospitalization was then further complicated by acute on chronic
renal failure, resulting in initiation of HD in 12/[**2182**]. That
hospitalization further was complicated by a seizure,
pericarditis, and a fall resulting in left humerus fracture.
Lastly, he developed C. diff colitis at the end of [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2182**], and started on po vancomycin.
.
On arrival to the ICU, initial VS T 98.2, HR 88, BP 118/68, RR
15, 95% on 5LNC. On exam, he appears mildly fatigued and has
crackles 2/3 up to lungs. He feels thirsty and has some mild
abdominal pain, but no other complaints. He says that he has
been having ~ 2 black bowel movements per day. He has also had
cough, mildly productive of tan sputum. He denies chest pain.

IMAGING:
[**2-2**] ERCP report: A metal stent placed in the biliary duct was
found in the major papilla. This had migrated distally slightly
and was partially embedded in the duodenal wall. The duodenal
wall was friable and ulcerated at the site of stent migration.
This was likely due to stent erosion, although underlying mass
lesion cannot be excluded. There was a yellowish bulging that
appeared attached to the duodenal wall of unclear significance.
The metal stent was removed - this was sent for cytology.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed. Contrast medium was
injected resulting in complete opacification. A single irregular
stricture that was 3 cm long was seen at the distal common bile
duct. There was moderate post-obstructive dilation with the CBD
measuring 18 mm. A 9cm by 10FR biliary stent was placed
successfully
