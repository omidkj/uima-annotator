CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT ABD W&W/O C

Reason: eval Type B dissection
Field of view: 40 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old man with type B disseciton at OSH
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval Type B dissection
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 73-year-old man with type B dissection at outside
hospital. Evaluate.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was
performed following the administration of 100 cc of intravenous
Optiray. Nonionic contrast was administered per protocol.
Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.

CT ANGIOGRAM CHEST: Dissection of the intrathoracic aorta begins
distal to the arch and terminates just proximal to the
diaphragm. Both lumens opacify symmetrically. The ascending
aorta enhances normally without evidence of penetrating ulcer or
hematoma. There is mild atherosclerosis, however, the remaining
great vessels enhance normally. No filling defects within the
pulmonary artery, or proximal branches. The heart, pericardium
are unremarkable. There is no pericardial effusion. There is a
small left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis. Lung
windows reveal centrilobular emphysema. Tiny 1-2 mm mainly
subpleural nodules are seen bilaterally.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT ORAL, WITH IV CONTRAST: Intra-abdominal aorta
is aneurysmal, measuring up to 4.7 cm at the level of the
diaphragm. Distal to this, the diameter decreased slightly and
then in the infrarenal portion, it measures up to 3.7 cm. There
is dense atherosclerosis, with intramural thrombus along its
course. There is no evidence of dissection. All intra- abdominal
arteries enhance appropriately. Imaging of the organs is
somewhat limited by the phase of contrast injection. Allowing
for this, the liver, pancreas, spleen, bilateral adrenal glands,
and both kidneys are unremarkable. Small gallstones are seen
within and otherwise normal-appearing gallbladder. The abdominal
loops of large and small bowel are normal in caliber and
contour. The appendix is seen in the right lower quadrant and
appears normal. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy. There is no free air and no free fluid.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The bladder,
sigmoid, rectum, and prostate are unremarkable. There is no
inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. There is no free air and no
free fluid.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
abnormalities.

IMPRESSION:
1. Type B aortic dissection extending from the aortic arch just
proximal to the level of the diaphragm.
2. Aneurysmal dilatation of the intra-abdominal aorta at the
level of the diaphragm, with ectasia more distally.
3. Centrilobular emphysema.
4. Atherosclerosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 73 [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] was admitted to the CSRU for blood pressure control
and was started on IV NTG.  He was weaned off NTG and Lopressor
and Lisinopril were increased.  He was transferred to the floor
on HD#2 and had a CTA with MMS reconstruction which revealed a
Type B dissection of the aorta from the distal arch to the
diaphragm.  He also has an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He was
discharged to home with a BP of 130/70 in 40 mg of Lisinopril
and Lopressor 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].  He will be seen in 3 weeks in the
aorta clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**].
