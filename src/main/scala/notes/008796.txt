[**9-7**] EKG: Baseline artifact
Atrial fibrillation
Ventricular premature complexes
Nonspecific lateral ST-T wave changes
Since previous tracing of [**2121-9-6**], atrial flutter now absent
.
[**9-6**] cxr: No change. Failure persists.

[**9-1**] arteriogram of mesenteric vessels: Aortogram and selective
arteriography of the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery,
and inferior mesenteric artery demonstrated no evidence of
active hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. GIB/hemorrhagic shock:  Patient received significant fluid
rehydration and 8 units PRBC in the ED. NG lavage performed in
the ED was negative with repoorted bilious return, however, in
the setting of elevated [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] upper GI source of bleeding
could not be definitively ruled out.  She also had a negatibve
mesenteric angiogram. GI deferred on scoping her in the ED
secondary to demand ischemia with EKG changes, and once the
patient was admitted to the MICU, was hemodynamically stable
with stable serial hct x >72 hours. Patient ultimately received
EGD and colonscopy on [**2121-9-5**] and these studies were negative for
acute bleed.  She was maintained with 2 large bore IVs, as well
as on IV PPIs, though subsequent transfusions were not required.
 Hct on day of discharge was 37.2 and BP remained stable on
metoprolol, baseline 90-120/40-70s. On the floor, the pt had
intermittent occult blood in the stool alternating w/ OB
negative stools. The pt did not have melena. The hematocrit has
been stable leading up to discharge. GI re-evaluated the pt and
elected not to rescope the patient given the minimal OB negative
stools with clinical stability and asymptomatic pt.
.
2. Patient was intubated in the ED for respiratory failure with
decreased oxygen saturations. Unclear of specific etiology,
though blood gas on admit to the ICU was 7.34/36/468/22.  In [**Name (NI) **],
pt was acutely anemic as well severely hypovolemic, and it was
postulated that given her subsequent clinical improvement and
extubation on HD 2 that initial hypoxemia was secondary to
technical limitations of oxygen saturation monitor.  CXR in ED
was at baseline. The pt did well after extubation and after
treatment of her CHF w/ aggressive diuresis, the pt was weaned
to an oxygen requirement of 0.5 liters by nasal cannula.
.
3. Leukocytosis: Likely represented acute demargination in
setting of GIB; WBC normalized over subsequent days. Pt had no
clinical signs or source of infection as CXR and UA were
negative. later in her course, she developed a right sided
facial swelling (see below) and leukocytosis.
.
4. Atrial fibrillation: Patient not maintained on coumadin or
beta-blocker as outpatient for uncertain reasons.  INR 0n
[**2121-9-2**] was 1.2.  Pt intermittently would be in atrial
fibrillation, though throughout these episodes, was
hemodynamically stable and would spontaneously convert to NSR.
In the setting of demand ischemia from GIB with EKG change, she
was started and maintained on metoprolol. Her metoprolol was
titrated up to 75mg po tid a
