Fevers

None


History of Present Illness:
61 y.o. M currently resident at [**Hospital1 1501**], h/o HTN, R MCA stroke with
L side hemiplegia, h/o chronic pain in all four extremities, CAD
s/p CABG, CKD who was admitted to the hospital with presumtive
PNA on [**5-18**].  Patient was subsequently transfered to ICU on [**5-21**]
after being found to be hypertensive to 190s with HR of 120 and
underlying Afib.  Patient has been refusing his PO medication
due to trouble swallowing.

Patient was admited initially with a fever to 103.3 at [**Hospital1 1501**], CXR
showed ? of retrocardiac opacity and he was given 3L of NS with
vanco/cipro and flagyl for PNA.  Head CT was unrearkable.
Since his admission he underwent speech and swallow test which
recommended modified diet of nectar thick liquids and puree
consistency solids with 1:1 supervision.  Pills can be crushed
in puree.  Patient however has been refusing his medication
since [**5-19**] due to nausea.  Thus he has not received most of his
PO BP medications.  Patient was thus trigered on [**5-20**] @ 5 am for
HR of 145 and BP of 100/70 after receiving Lopressor 5 mg IV x
2.  Patient also had decreased UO ~ 50 cc from 12 am to 4 am and
IVF 125 cc/hr were started.  Patient subsequently continued to
be tachycardic and he received 10 mg IV Dilt x 3 with HR return
to SR in 80s and hypertensive to SBP 190s.  Patient was
subsequently transfered to ICU for continued BP management.

Micro:
Urine culture ([**2196-5-18**] and [**2196-5-22**]): No growth
Spurum
 ([**2196-5-19**]): Moderate growth MRSA
 ([**2196-5-22**]): No growth
Blood ([**2196-5-19**]): No growth
.
Imaging:
CT Head ([**2196-5-17**]): No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or
acute process.

Chest xray PA and lateral ([**2196-5-18**]): Focal increased density
behind the
heart.

Ankle x-ray ([**2196-5-19**]): No osteomyelitis.

Echo ([**2196-5-23**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis of the septum and basal inferior wall, and milder
hypokinesis of the other LV segments (EF 30%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild right ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.

Renal U/S ([**2196-5-23**]): 1.  Abnormal area of increased
echogenicity in the anterior upper pole of the right kidney with
ill-defined margins.  Recommend MRI for further evaluation. 2.
Slightly increased RIs on the left.  Normal Doppler study on the
right.

Gastric emptying study ([**2196-5-24**]): Limited study although there
is no evidence to indicate delayed gastric emptying.  There is
delayed esophageal clearance, which could reflect dysmotility.
An esophogram and upper GI study may be helpful for further
evaluation.

Head CT ([**2196-5-24**]): No overt interval change in the appearance
of the brain compared to the prior head CT scan.  Obviously, it
is possible that an acute area of brain ischemia could be
present, and yet undetectable by the present CT examination.
ADDENDUM:  Redemonstrated is moderately extensive
atherosclerotic calcification of the distal left vertebral
artery and both cavernous internal carotid arteries.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1661**] was admitted with fevers and left-shifted
leukocytosis. Infectious work-up revealed a retrocardiac opacity
on chest x-ray and sputum was found to grow MRSA. The patient
received a 7 day total course of vancomycin. Other infectious
work-up, including LFT's and ankle x-ray (to rule out
osteomyelitis)were negative.
.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by a fib with RVR
requiring transfer to the ICU. The patient returned  to NSR with
IV lopressor and remained in NSR for the duration of his ICU
course. The patient's bp meds were held in the se
