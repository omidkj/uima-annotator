Attending:[**Known lastname 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] for ST elevations on EKG

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Intubation and ventilation
Placement of arterial and central venous lines
Placement of Swan-Ganz catheter

History of Present Illness:
75yo woman w/ PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism, Hep C, transferred
from [**Hospital3 3583**] for cardiac catheterization for ST
elevations. She was admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**8-20**] for
cervical LAD, fatigue, weight loss, worked up for lymphoma.
While there, she was found to have bilateral pleural effusions,
LAD. Went today ([**8-25**]) for LN biopsy. Sometime on [**8-25**], she
developed dyspnea, tachycardia to 130s-140s, and ST elevations
in the anteroseptal and inferior leads. She was transferred here
for cardiac catheterization. Upon arrival (on heparin and nitro
gtt), she was confused, diaphoretic, and lethargic. Cardiac cath
showed clean coronary arteries. She was noted to have RAP 19,
RVP 45/19, PAP 45/30, PCWP 27, CO 3.94, CI 2.43, and anterior
wall motion hypokinesis suggestive of myocardial stunning. She
did not have pericardial effusions. ABG was 7.17/23/79/11 with
lactate 12.9 and repeat 7.13/30/89/11 with lactate 14.6. Glucose
was 20 and she was given D50. She was admitted to the CCU.

Path from OSH, read at [**Hospital1 18**]:

Lymph node, right neck, excisional Biopsy (Consult slides
received from [**Hospital3 3583**], [**Location (un) 3320**], MA; dated [**2140-8-25**];
labelled: 05:S7476):

Non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma with high-grade features, diffuse
large B-cell vs. atypical Burkitt lymphoma, see note.

Note:  Nodal architecture is diffusely effaced by a
proliferation of large atypical cells with round-to-convoluted
nuclear outlines, dispersed chromatin, and one-to-several small
nucleoli.  There is prominent apoptotic debris and brisk mitotic
activity.  The infiltrate extends into adipose tissue and around
blood vessels and nerves.  Focal areas of geographic necrosis
are seen.
By report, flow cytometry performed at [**Company 2475**] (NY-05-[**Numeric Identifier 62875**]),
showed a kappa-restricted B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
CD10 staining was reportedly equivocal.  No immunohistochemical
work-up and/or blocks were submitted.
Overall, the features are of a high-grade non-Hodgkin B-cell
lymphoma.  Given the brisk mitoses and reported questionable
CD10 positivity by flow cytometry, the differential diagnosis
includes a high grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma versus an
atypical Burkitt lymphoma. The block will be requested for
additional immunohistochemical and possible FISH studies, and
the findings reported in an addendum.
ADDENDUM:
Immunoperoxidase studies performed on the requested block shows
that the lymphoma is immunoreactive for CD20, BCL-2, dimming for
BCL-2, and negative for CD10.  CD3 stain reveals scattered
mature T-lymphocytes.  This consternation of immunophenotypic
findings supports the diagnosis of a high-grade diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma.  And would be atypical for Burkitt's lymphoma
(whether morphologically typical or atypical).

Cardiac info:

EKG:
1426 sinus tachycardia at 115bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, low
voltage in limb leads, no ST changes, q waves, TWI

ECHO:
([**8-25**]) Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal akinesis of the distal half of the septum, distal third of
the anterior and inferior walls, and apex. The remaining
segments contract well. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD (mid-LAD lesion; if no significant CAD, c/w Takasubo's
cardiomyopathy).

ECHO ([**9-2**]): Conclusions:
1. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include akinesis of the lower half to [**12-24**]'s of the
left ventricle . The left ventricular function is severely
depressed.
2.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
3.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5.There is no pericardial effusion.
6. There is both ascites and a large left sided pleural effusion
present.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
10/605, no change. The previous assessment of the LV function
was possibly overestimated.

Cath:
COMMENTS: 1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant
patient revealed no angiographically significant coronary artery

disease.  The LMCA, LCX, LAD, RCA and branch vessels were all
normal.
The LAD had a myocardial bridge with minor systolic compression.

2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed severe elevation of right and
left
sided filling pressures with mean RA 19 and mean PCWP of 28
which
increased to almost 40 when repeated at the end of the case.
The
cardiac index was preserved at 2.3.  A bedside echo showed
anterior and
apical akinesis with severely depressed EF of 25%.  There was no

significant effusion.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No coronary artery disease.
2. Severely elevated filling pressures and LV dysfunction
possibly due
to sepsis with acid
