DELIVER

Echo [**2-28**]: Poor image quality. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is probably mild (possibly moderate) aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.3 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CTA CHEST:
1. Limited study. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Bilateral tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, most pronounced in the
lingula, likely
due to infection.
3. Small left and moderate right pleural effusions with adjacent
atelectasis.
4. Coronary artery calcification

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST, MRA NECK W/CONTRAST, MRA BRAIN W/O
CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of infarction or hemorrhage. Fluid in the right
mastoid air cells and mucus retention in the sphenoid sinuses.
MRA brain and neck demonstrates no large aneurysms, dissection
or
flow-limiting stenosis.

MR KNEE W/O CONTRAST RIGHT
FINDINGS: Again extremely limited examination as described
above. In
addition, flexion of the knee limits the axial images. The ACL
and PCL are
grossly intact, but not well seen. The MCL is grossly intact,
but not well
seen. The components of the LCL complex are not well seen but
appear grossly intact on the axial images. The popliteus tendon
is grossly intact.

The distal quadriceps tendon and patellar tendon are grossly
intact. The
medial and lateral retinacula are grossly intact. [**Last Name (un) 75398**] fat
pad contains
fat, but is not well seen.

There is a complex tear of the lateral meniscus with a radial
tear of the body and oblique components of the anterior and
posterior horns. There is an oblique undersurface tear of the
posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the medial meniscus. The menisci are not well
seen.

Probable tricompartmental articular cartilage abnormalities,
which are not
well seen. Tricompartmental osteophytosis.

Small joint effusion. No [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.

BILAT HIPS (AP,LAT & AP PELVIS	 	Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 75399**]
IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes in the right hip with a
fractured screw,
acuity unknown. No definite fracture or dislocation. If occult
fracture is
suspected, MRI could be performed.

EGD Report
Very mild erythema in the stomach
No source of bleeding was identified. The patient desaturated
during the procedure and therefore no pictures were obtained.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Colonoscopy Report
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year-old woman who presented to the hospital with progressive
fatigue. She was found to have guaiac positive brown stool and
severe anemia with hematocrit 14. She
has been transfused 6 units of packed red blood and had upper
and lower endoscopy performed which did not find a source of
bleeding.

Post-procedure we found her to have a worsened respiratory
status.  Echocardiogram revealed aortic stenosis and EF of
75-80%. Blood gas initially demonstrated hypercapneia with pCO2
77.  The patient had inconsistent use of BiPAP because of
discomfort with the facemask.  In addition gentle diuresis was
attempted because of concern that the 6 units of blood
transfusion caused her to become volume overloaded.  On [**3-6**],
the patient became obtunded because of even more severe
hypercapnia with pCO2 120.  She was intubated and transferred to
the ICU.

She was d
