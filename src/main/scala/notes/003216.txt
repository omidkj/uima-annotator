History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 51106**] is a 50M with history of hepatitis C s/p aborted
IFN treatment and alcohol cirrhosis, who is transferred from OSH
with GI bleed and hypotension. On transplant list. Discharged on
20th hepatic encephalopathy.
.
Presented yesterday morning to [**Hospital 792**]Hospital with
massive esophageal bleed with hgb 5, sbp 50s. [**Last Name (un) **] was
placed in the ED, had esoph banding x 5. A total 10u rbc, 8u
ffp, 15u platelets, 15mg vit K, 7L NS was given in the course.
Post banding he arrived to the OSH MICU. He was progressively
hypotensive and was started on 20 of levophed + vasopressin. He
was placed on protonix and octreotide drip. Decision to transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**] yesterday. This now on 2 of levophed, off vasopressin,
map 65. Intubated on pressure control 40 fio2, 22/5. This AM
prior to transfer hgb 8.8, plt 120--> 71 despite transfusion,
wbc 8.7. Was placed on cefotaxime for empiric sbp coverage but
climb from 1.2-2.6. Potassium to 6 this am-- got ca gluc,
insulin, d50, starting bicarb gtt, no peaked T wave changes on
EKG. INR from 5--> 1.8 after vit k, ffp. T bili 16.1, AST 1323,
314. Prior to tranfer map 65, hr 70 (L arm 20mm
difference),patient intubated sedated (morphine and ativan).
Note of a distended abdomen with report of kub with gas. No
further active hematemesis. Yesterday blood coming from mouth
and nasopharynx which was thought [**1-15**] trauma. [**Last Name (un) **] has been
discontinued. He received 4mg morphine, 4mg ativan over past
24h. Access included R IJ TLC, 2 periph 18, 1 20gg IV. They had
planned to order 2u RBC for transport. Discussion with [**Hospital1 18**]
hepatology service was done prior to transfer. Last MELD 42.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU patient hypotensive to 70/40,
vasopressin added with good result MAP to 62. Abdomen markedly
distended.
.

hepatorenal.

Social History:

Physical Exam:
VS: 104, 80/40, 98.4, CVP 33, bladder pressure 25. AC PEEP 5, RR
14, TV 550.
GEN: ill appearing male with distended abdomen on ventilator,
jaundiced
HEENT: icteric difficult to assess JVP. Blood suctioned from
oropharynx, ET tube present
CV: RRR no MRG
CHEST: diminished breath sounds bilaterally
ABD: distended, tense, dullness to percussion. No bowel sounds
heard. Hepatosplenomegaly present. Site of previous para with
oozing of peritoneal fluid, echymoses.
EXTR: edema, cool LE, palpable distal pulses
NEURO: sedated.

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2103-4-6**]:
SINGLE PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST: Compared to CT of [**2103-4-1**]. The
extreme
lung apices are excluded on this study as is the left CP angle.
There is a NG tube in place with its tip in the fundus of the
stomach. The visualized lung parenchyma is clear. There is no
evidence of CHF/volume overload. The heart size is within normal
limits and the mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.

ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) PORT [**2103-4-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with cirrhosis.
2. Bidirectional Doppler waveform in the main portal vein,
indicating mixed hepatopetal and hepatofugal flow.
3. Gallstones with gallbladder wall thickening, stable.
4. Small amount of ascites.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2103-4-7**]:
SINGLE SUPINE PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH: Compared to study of one hour
prior. The [**Last Name (un) **] tube remains in place with its tip coursing
off the inferior aspect of the image. It loops on the superior
aspect of the image, perhaps residing outside of the patient,
but may be coiled in the hypopharynx. The balloon has been
deflated since the prior radiograph. There is no definitive
evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. There remains
moderate volume overload. Right IJ tip is difficult to directly
visualize given technique.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY) PORT [**2103-4-7**]:
FINDINGS: There is a nasogastric tube and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube
identified. There is a large amount of gas seen within the
stomach. There are prominent loops of likely colon. There is
also increased density throughout the abdomen consistent with
known ascites. There is no definite evidence for free
intra-abdominal air or pneumatosis. This bowel gas pattern is
nonspecific. If there is high clinical concern, a CT scan could
be performed.
