History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with multiple recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] following fall on
[**2150-1-19**] with C1 fracture after a mechanical fall down stairs.
She was evaluated for surgery but was found to be nonoperable,
and was placed in a C-collar at least through [**4-19**] to be
followed up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 23161**]. She was also noted to have an
associated vertebral artery dissection and was treated
conservatively with aspirin, and a large retropharyngeal
hematoma. She was discharged to [**Hospital1 1501**] on [**1-27**].
.
On [**1-29**] she was seen in the ED after sliding out of a chair, but
the C1 fracture was stable. She was sent back to rehab, but was
noted to not be eating well and have a WBC count of 34k. She was
sent to [**Hospital3 **], then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2150-2-4**] for
white count of 34K, significant dehydration, intraventricular
hemorrhage and question of colitis. Her hospital course was
complicated by C dif sepsis with hypotension requiring pressors,
acute renal failure, subdural hematoma (stable). She was
discharged to [**Hospital6 **] on [**2150-2-17**].
.
Today she was noted to have fevers to 101-102 and loose slightly
bloody stools. She was started on flagyl, then received empiric
vancomycin and imipenem and was transferred to the ED. In the
ED, she was noted to be tachycardic and febrile, and received
about 2 liters of fluids without improvement in her HR. She was
never hypotensive. They also gave her some ativan and haldol for
agitation. Cultures were drawn and she got additional 500 mg IV
flagyl and was admitted to the MICU service.
.
ROS: denies pain. Other ROS limited by hearing loss and mental
status.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2150-3-3**] 10:25 PM
IMPRESSION: Nonspecific but non-obstructive bowel gas pattern.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-3-3**] 10:21 PM
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis with left pleural effusion.
Retrocardiac opacity likely represents combination of these two
processes, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-3-4**] 5:09 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate sized layering left pleural effusion, and small
right pleural effusion, both increased from [**2150-3-3**].
2. Increase in size and density of retrocardiac opacity, which
may be related to technical differences, but this area remains
suspicious for underlying consolidation or atelectasis.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-3-5**] 5:50 AM
IMPRESSION: Moderate bibasilar pleural effusions with increasing
size of the right effusion. Retrocardiac opacity suggests
atelectasis or consolidation.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-3-6**] 5:55 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Unsatisfactory placement of Dobbhoff tube which is coiled in
the upper mediastinum. Recommend immediate removal.
2. Appearance of cardiomediastinal silhouette and lung fields
are not significantly changed compared to an hour prior.
These findings were discussed with the SICU nurse at the time of
this dictation.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-3-6**] 5:04 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Intrabronchial placement of Dobbhoff tube. These results were
immediately called to the SICU.
2. Moderate bibasilar pleural effusions and persistent
retrocardiac opacity suggesting atelectasis versus
consolidation.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-3-7**] 10:41 AM
FINDINGS:
The tip of the NGT is well below the diaphragm and seen just to
the left of midline by the L4 vertebral body. Perhaps the chest
is obscured from view and the lower portions demonstrate some
atelectatic features.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2150-3-8**] 3:56 PM
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change of left frontal
cerebral convexity subdural hematoma. Decrease in lateral
ventricle hemorrhage and frontal subgaleal hematomas.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2150-3-8**] 11:17 AM
Supine views of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate no evidence
of intestinal obstruction. Previously reported distended
air-filled loops of bowel have decreased in caliber since the
previous study.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-3-8**] 8:28 AM
Nasogastric tube remains in place terminating below the
diaphragm. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in size.
Bilateral pleural effusions have worsened, moderate on the right
and small-to-moderate on the left, with adjacent basilar
opacities that likely represent atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with MMP including C difficle infection, UTI, PICC line
infection, PNA.
.
#) fever, elevated WBC - Patient was on multiple antibiotics to
treat C. diff, Pseudomonas/VRE UTI, Coag - staph PICC line
associated bacteremia, PNA and these were likely the causes of
her fevers and leuckocytosis.  After discussion the family,
these measures were to be discontinued prior to [**Age over 90 **].
.
#) Respiratory distress: Patient with hypercarbic respiratory
distress.  Patient is DNI and CPAP contraindicated at this time
as patient has some respiratory secretions.  After discussion
with the family, it was determined that the patient definitively
not be intubated and she was not transferred to the MICU for
respiratory ventilation. RA saturations are 86-88%.
.
#) Mental status - AAOx3 intermittently in the MICU, although
while on the floor the patinet has been slightly responsive to
noxious stimulus.  Family has been by the bedside and have
reassured us that this is not her baseline..
.
#) Paroxysmal atrial
