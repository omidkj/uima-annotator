Chief Complaint:
hypotension, LLE pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right groin line placement
Right radial artery line placement

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a legally blind [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH significant for CHF,
infra-renal AAA s/p endovascular repair with chronic leak, and
peripheral vascular disease with chronic bilateral LE skin
tears, presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-3**] with hypotension and a
3-day hx of worsening LLE pain. She was seen by her VNA (helps
manage her chronic skin tears) who found patient hypotensive.
Patient also reports LE pain was throbbing and sharp diffuse
throughout her entire leg. On presentation, she denies any chest
pain/SOB/palpitations, fevers/chills (although frequently cold),
nausea/vomiting. She reported chronic diarrhea, decreased
appetite and chronic skin tears worse in the lower extremities
bilaterally.
.
Per patient's nephew (very involved in her care): Pt. has been
hypotensive over the last week accompanied with weakness and
confusion. Also, pt's PCP discontinued her [**Name9 (PRE) **] 80 mg on
[**2103-6-27**] for these episodes of hypotension and weakness, but
increased her furosemide to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Her nephew voiced concern
about pt's very poor PO intable, ability to take medications on
her own and perform ADLs.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.4 P 61 BP 91/48 R 20 O2 sat.
SBPs were in the 90-100s range. On exam she is a frail, elderly
woman and LLE warm, erythematous w/ appearance of cellulitis.
Cannot palpate pulses, but easy to doppler. Patient was given
vanc/zosyn/clinda. Access 20G in R antecub. Got 1500cc of fluid
total. Reported guiac positive stool in the ED. Vitals prior to
transfer 96.7 56 101/83 13 96% on 4L NC.
.
On arrival in the MICU, her VS were T:94.8 (rectal) BP: 95/42
P:64 R: 18 O2: 94% on 3L NC and she complained of pain in her LE
extremities worse in her left, chills, oriented to self, place
and date but had somewhat of tangential speech. She was bolused
500cc twice with unresponsive MAPs and with difficult central
access via SC or IJ, an A-line was placed and phenylepherine
(stopped at 6AM on [**7-5**]) given for 24 hours and was gradually
weaned off. She was found to grow 4000 GNR on urine cultures
resistant to b-lactams on speciation. There were no other
impressive sources of infection although a CT abd and
gallbladder U/S had evidence of chronic cholecystitis. LE films
was neg for gas or fluid collections. She was worked up with a
CT abd, hand was gradually weaned of pressors with 250cc
boluses. Her labs were neg for bands.

3. Decreased vision R eye, now legally blind
4. PVD - s/p arthrectomy and B/L superficial femoral artery PTCA
