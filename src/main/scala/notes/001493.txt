79 year old male with history of possible mastocytosis with
recurrent episodes of anaphylactoid reactions with an infectious
prodome presents with shaking chills x 2 days, 1 day of diarrhea

[**2160-7-1**] CXR: The right internal jugular vein catheter tip is in
the SVC. No pneumothorax. Unchanged cardiomediastinal contour. A
small left basilar atelectasis.

[**2160-7-1**] Neck CT: Air within musculature of the right temporal
and mandibular region; air within small veins in the right
anterior neck region extending down into the superior- anterior
mediastinum.

[**2160-7-1**] CTA chest: No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Bibasilar
atelectasis. Increase of bony densities in the laminae of
several upper thoracic component vertebrae, which in the absence
of a primary malignancy, most likely represent degenerative
changes. Non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.

[**2160-7-6**] CT Abd/pelvis w/ contrast: No intra-abdominal malignancy
or lymphadenopathy identified. Cholelithiasis without evidence
of cholecystitis


Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old male with recurrent anaphylactoid reactions presents
with sore throat, fever, and hypotension.

1) Fever/hypotension: The patient was admitted to the medical
ICU, where he was volume resuscitated and empirically covered
with ceftriaxone/clindamycin (for possible retropharyngeal
abscess on Neck CT). He was evaluated by the ENT service, who
examined the patient and felt that retropharyngeal abscess was
unlikely. The patient rapidly improved with
antibiotics/steroids, similar to prior episodes he has had since
[**2151**]. He was transferred to the general medical floor on
[**2160-7-5**]. The etiology of his presenting symptoms remain unclear
(infectious vs immunologic). The infectious disease service was
consulted. They felt that, while possible, bacterial infection
was unlikely, and that the patient likely had a reaction to a
viral illness. They recommended a 10 day course of antibiotics
(initially ceftriaxone/clindamycin, transition to levofloxacin
prior to discharge). At time of discharge, strongyloides
serologieis and HCV PCR were pending. Urine cultures and blood
cultures had no growth to date. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2603**] of allergy, who
follows Mr. [**Known lastname 20008**] as an outpatient, was also consulted. At time
of discharge, serum tryptase and serum IgE, obtained to
determine whether this episode was consistent with an allergic
reaction, were pending.

2) Pancytopenia/Possible immunodeficiency: Initially, the
patient was noted to have a low CD4 (repeat check showed high
CD4 count) as well as depressed igG subsets. HIV Antibody and
viral load were negative, and the infectious disease service
felt that, even if the patient were immunosuppressed, his
clinical picture was not consistent with an opportunistic
infection. In terms of malignancy work-up, hematology/oncology
was consulted for possible bone marrow biopsy (given mild
pancytopenia), which will be performed when the patient follows
up with them as an outpatient. His last colonoscopy was in [**2154**]
and was negative except for diverticulosis. PSA, SPEP/UPEP were
negative during this hospitalization. In order to look for
lymphadenopathy that could suggest malignancy or lymphoma, he
underwent an Abd CT [**7-6**], which showed no evidence of
LAD/malignancy. [**7-1**] chest CTA had showed only small
non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. The patient
will have a repeat IgG level/subsets and CD4 checked as an
outpatient 2 weeks following discharge. If CD4 count falls
again, PCP prophylaxis may be considered. If IgG is persistently
low, the patient may benefit from Ig infusions.

3) Hyperlipidemia: The patient's lipitor, which had been held in
the setting of acute illness, was restarted prior to discharge

4) Edema/mild CHF: EF 50-55%, [**12-24**]+ MR, impaired LV relaxation.
Following transfer to the floor, the patient was noted to have
marked lower extremity edema, which improved with furosemide
diuresis. This likely represents fluid overload in the setting
of volume resuscitation while in the ICU. There were no EKG
changes suggesting myocardial ischemia. His norvasc was
discontinued, as this could contribute to his edema. He was
started on low dose furosemide, and will have his electrolytes
checked within 1 week followed discharge to ensure stability.
Addition of an ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction, may be
considered as an outpatient.

5) DM-II: The patient was initially placed on a regular insulin
sliding scale, after which he was restarted on
glipizide/rosiglitazone with adequate blood sugar control
