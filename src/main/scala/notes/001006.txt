History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 37080**] is a 55-year-old gentleman who is referred to the
Thoracic [**Hospital 32535**] Clinic by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1968**]. Mr.

cerebellar tumor resected in [**2140**]. The pathology on this was
adenocarcinoma, which appeared to be metastatic from an unknown
primary. During recent workup for his shoulder pain, he
underwent films which revealed a new pulmonary nodule on the
right side. This was followed with a chest CT, which confirmed
the presence of two new nodules (in comparison with CT scan done
in [**2143**]), in the right lower lobe (FDG avid) as well as a stable
nodule in the right upper lobe.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2150-7-31**] 10:36 AM
Reason: eval for interval change
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
55 year old man with s/p vats RLL
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for interval change
INDICATION: Evaluation for interval change.

FINDINGS: There is mild improving apical right pneumothorax.
There has been interval increase in right lower lobe
atelectasis. However, the subpulmonic effusion is stable. Left
lung is clear. Heart, mediastinum and hilar contours are normal.
The patient is status post sternotomy.

IMPRESSION: Improving small right apical pneumothorax.Worsening

Reason: please eval for etiology
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
55 year old man with aggitation altern w/ episode sedation; s/p
cerebellar tumor resection '[**40**]
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval for etiology
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 55-year-old man with agitation alternating with
sedation. Status post cerebellar tumor resection in [**2140**]. Please
evaluate for etiology.
TECHNIQUE: CT scan of the head prior to and following
administration of IV contrast.
COMPARISON: MR of the head with and without contrast from
[**2150-6-20**].

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage
or major vascular territorial infarcts. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. There is hypoattenuation of the
periventricular white matter consistent with chronic
microvascular disease. The ventricles are mildly enlarged and
the sulci are prominent for the patient's age, consistent with
atrophy. The fourth ventricle is enlarged from patient's
previous cerebellar resection. The superior vermis appears to be
resected.

The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. There are no soft
tissue or bony abnormalities.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Evidence of prior cerebellar resection of the superior vermis
resulting in enlargement of the fourth ventricle.
3. Periventricular white matter disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 37080**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent
flexible bronchoscopy, VATS right lower lobe wedge resection,
followed by a VATS right lower lobectomy and mediastinal lymph
node dissection.  He was initially extubated, however in the
PACU, he developed hypotension requiring pressors, and
progressive respiratory acidosis requiring reintubation for
airway protection and repeat flexible bronchoscopy.  He was
transferred in stable condition to the thoracic intensive care
unit.

He recovered quickly with improving respiratory status and was
weaned off of pressors.  He was weaned from the ventilator and
extubated without complication on the morning of post-operative
day #1 ([**2150-7-25**]).  Despite being awake and alert he
