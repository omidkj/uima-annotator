Chief Complaint:
Flank pain

Stenting of left renal artery with covered stent (7 Fr sheath)
[**2155-4-7**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 84 yo gentleman with history of afib on
coumadin, RCC who presented to the ED today with flank pain in
the settting of recent renal biopsy. Pt states that he was in
his usual state of health when he went for a biopsy of a left
peritoneal lymph node last tuesday. He tolerated the procedure
well and was feeling well until Sunday when he noted significant
L flank pain. Over the course of the day his sxs worsened and
pain migrated to his left abdomen as well. At that time he was
advised to go to the ED by his daughter, an ICU nurse.

In the ED, initial vs were: 97 73 139/100 20 99% sat. Labs were
notable for elevated WBC to 18.9 with 92% neutrophils. Crit
dropped from 38.1 to 32.6, however this was with 1.5 L fluid.
INR was elevated to 1.8. Urine notable for elevated WBC, RBCs
and nitrate. Patient was given Morphine, hydromorphone,
ondansetron and phytonadione as well as 2 U FFP to reverse INR.
CT abd showed retroperitoneal bleed, slightly enlarged from
prior. IR was contact[**Name (NI) **] and did not feel that the bleeding was
excessive, however was concerned for possible pseudoanuerysm
based on CT findings and therefore recommended angiogram in AM
for further characterization. Surgery was also consulted and did
not recommend surgical intervention at this time. He was
admitted to the ICU for monitoring given unstable vitals and
crit drop. 20 gauge IV in L and 2 IVs in R. After 2 Ls NS in the
ED, vitals were 100/59, HR 66.
.
On the floor, pt is doing well without new complaints. History
is obtained primarily through his daughter at pts request. His
pain persists however he states that he had some improvement
with the pain meds given in the ED.

IMAGING:

[**4-7**] CXR: No evidence of pneumothorax or acute cardiopulmonary
process. In comparison to [**2155-2-11**] exam, there is marked
improvement of the left lower lobe opacity.

[**4-7**] CTA AB/PEL: . The known left perirenal left retroperitoneal
hemorrhage is slightly larger and has higher attenuation,
compared to the prior study done 5 hours earlier. The superior
hematoma now measures, 7.5 x 5.5 cm, previously 6.4 x 4.9 cm.
The inferiorly seen hematoma now measures 9.7 x 8.0 cm. The
findings were discussed with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **] at 7:20 p.m on [**2155-4-7**].
The hematoma extends into the left inguinal hernia. Dense
contrast pooling in the upper pole of the left kidney, likely
contained urinoma. 2. S/P RF ablation of a left renal mass. Soft
tissue nodule in this RF ablation site, left adrenal lesion, and
left para-aortic lymphadenopathy are all unchanged. 3.
Infrarenal AAA maximally [**Last Name (un) **] 4.1 cm. 4. Bilateral multiple
pulmonary nodules.

[**4-8**] CXR: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in
sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next
preceding PA and lateral chest examination of [**2155-4-8**].
Heart size unchanged.
Densities on the left lung base obliterating partially the
diaphragmatic
contours remain. Inspirational effort is lower than on the
preceding study, which accounts for the more crowded appearance
of the pulmonary vasculature which also may represent some
increased fluid load. No new pulmonary abnormalities can be
identified on this portable chest examination. No pneumothorax
has developed. Review is also performed of a torso CT of [**2-12**], [**2155**], which demonstrated among other findings an
inflammatory process in the left lower lobe. This finding has
decreased, but was not completely eliminated on the next
preceding PA and lateral chest examination of [**2155-4-7**].
The remaining left basal densities may well be the cause of the
increased white blood count. If diagnostic difficulties persist,
consider a PA and lateral chest examination or renewed CT to
evaluate in more detail the previously identified pulmonary
processes as seen on CT in [**Month (only) 404**].

[**4-8**] Ultrasound:
1. Suboptimal exam. Left retroperitoneal hematoma is poorly
visualized and
obscures evaluation of the left kidney.
2. Simple right renal cysts. Otherwise, unremarkable ultrasound
of the right kidney.

[**4-9**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**4-8**], there has been
placement of a right IJ catheter that extends to the
mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. The endotracheal tube and
nasogastric tube remain in place. Overall appearance of the
heart and lungs is essentially unchanged.

[**4-9**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
1. Small right effusion and associated bibasilar atelectasis.
2. Increase in size of left-sided retroperitoneal hematoma.
3. Development of anasarca, likely due to resuscitation.
4. Persistent predominantly cortical enhancement involving both
kidneys,
indicating an element of ATN.

Brief Hospital Course:
84yo gentleman with RCC, s/p recent aortic lymph node biopsy who
presents with flank pain, dropping HCT and evidence of RP bleed
on CT.
.
# Retroperitoneal bleed with subsequent hemorrhagic shock:
Patient admitted with flank pain, 6 point drop in HCT, and
intermittently unstable blood pressures, likely due to bleeding
s/p recent procedure and elevated INR while on anticoagulation
for afib.
