Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion, transferred from OSH.

[**2194-3-8**] - Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 61 yo F with a history of MI, and IDDM diabetes who
presented to an outside hospital with the onset of worsening
dyspnea on exertion. Apparently she was in her usual state of
health (dyspnea with significant exertion) when she began
feeling vague chest dull pain similar to her previous MI (approx
Thursday AM). The pressure continued on and off until
presentation. Notably the pressure again started night prior to
admission approx at 5 PM and lasted "all night". When she
noticed that she was more short of breath with walking to the
mailbox this morning, she came to the ED. She has not had any
dizziness, light headedness, presyncope/syncope, nausea,
vomitng, fever, chills. She also noted last night feeling weak
and took 4 glucose pills (did not check FS). This morning she
found that she had a glucose of >400 and gave herself 2U insulin
and repeat FS was 230s.
.
At the outside hospital she was found to have ECG changes c/w ST
elevations in inferior leads and labs notable for Trop I > 50,
CK > 1200 with MBI 7.6% started on aspirin 325 mg, Plavix 300
mg, Integrelin bolus +drip (1040AM), heparin bolus + drip
(3000U, 600Ugtt). Additionally she was given levofloxacin 500 mg
for suspicion of pneumonia on CXR as well as morphine and
nitroglycerin for CP.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were 76 114/54, 18,
98% RA. She was given Integrillin 2 mcg/kg/min (briefly),
heparin 600 U/hr gtt, mucomyst 600 mg x 1, 1/2 NS with 1 amp Na
HC03, 300 mg plavix.
.
On arrival to the CCU, she had no chest pain, no shortness of
breath. Only had right shoulder pain after laying on the cath
table.

Admission CXR: FINDINGS: Portable upright chest radiograph is
reviewed and compared to [**2187-5-20**]. Cardiac size is not
enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
Pulmonary vasculature is not enlarged. There is ill-defined
airspace opacity, with air bronchograms within the right upper
lobe, likely the posterior segment, and also probably in the
right lower lung field. The left lung is clear. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Right- sided pacemaker and two
leads overlying the heart are unchanged in position since prior
exam. Osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe pneumonia.

ECHO [**3-11**]:

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Mild regional  LV systolic dysfunction. False LV tendon (normal
variant). Mildly depressed  LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal inferior  - akinetic; mid inferior - akinetic; mid
inferolateral - hypo; inferior apex -  akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal PA  systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior akinesis and inferolateral  hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic  valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and  no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2194-3-8**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
mild
disease.  The LAD had a 90% stenosis in the mid vessel and a 50%

stenosis in the mid vessel.  The LCx had a 90% ostial lesion and
a 70%
lesion in the mid vessel.  The RCA had a 40% proximal stenosis,
60% mid
vessel stenosis, and 60% distal stenosis.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left and right
sided
filling pressures with an LVEDP and RVEDP of 21 mmHg and 17
mmHg,
respectively.  There was pulmonary arterial hypertension with a
PA
pressure of 50/22 (systolic/diastolic in mmHg).  Cardiac index
was
severely depressed at 1.5 l/min/m2.
