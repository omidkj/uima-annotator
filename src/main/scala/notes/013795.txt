CHF (diastolic) on 2liters NC, recurrent PE on coumadin,
myopathy, back pain, migraine, depression, sleep apnea on CPAP,
GERD, and CRI admitted for hypoxia sp fall.

Patient states that over the past week or so she has noted a 10
pounds weight gain with increasing lower extremity edema with
increase in her toursemide dose and improvement in her lower
extremity edema. She also notes not being able to lie flat
forcing her to move to her couch. She decided to come to the
hospital after falling today while walking to the bathroom. No
chest pain, palpitation during this time. She denies hitting her
head though has had bilateral hip pain since that time. She
denies any fevers at home. Though she has had a productive cough
over the past few weeks. Denies abdominal pain, however endorses
non-bloody diarrhea. States she does have neck pain from
sleeping on the couch though no stiffness. No changes in vision
or headaches. No rashes or sinusitis. No burning with urination
or increase in urinary frequency. Pt has had influenza vaccine.

ECHO [**2197-1-3**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is probably normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

HEAD CT [**2197-1-2**]:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
2. Bone remodeling in the left maxillary sinus indicates prior
chronic
sinusitis.

L SPINE XRAY [**2197-1-2**]:
MPRESSION: Degenerative disease without definite signs of
fracture or
malalignment. If there is strong clinical concern for acute
pathology, MR is advised.

BILATERAL HIP XRAY [**2197-1-2**]:
FINDINGS: AP view of the pelvis and two views of each hip were
obtained. The bony pelvic ring appears intact. SI joints appear
normal. Both hips appear normally aligned with minimal
acetabular spurring, right greater than left.  Bone
mineralization appears normal. Femoral necks appear intact
bilaterally.  Mild vascular calcification is present.

CXR [**2197-1-2**]:
FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.
Patient is
slightly rotated to her left, limits evaluation as does the
underpenetrated technique. Cardiomegaly is noted with pulmonary
vascular congestion and pulmonary edema noted diffusely. No
definite pleural effusions are seen. No large pneumothorax as
well. Aortic calcifications are noted. Bony structures appear
intact.

IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with congestive heart failure.

[**2197-1-2**] EKG:
Bigeminal rhythm of uncertain mechanism. Low amplitude atrial
wave forms are difficult to assess but may be sinus or ectopic
atrial with A-V conduction delay. Left atrial abnormality with
atrial bigeminy or ectopic atrial rhythm. Right bundle-branch
block. Left anterior fascicular block. Delayed R wave
progression with late precordial QRS transition is
non-diagnostic. ST-T wave configuration with prolonged QTc
interval is probably primary. Clinical correlation is suggested.
Since the previous tracing of [**2196-5-18**] the rate is faster and
bigeminal pattern is now present.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 57 F with a PMH of diabetes, diastolic CHF, on 3L
O2 at home, recurrent DVT on coumadin, sleep apnea on CPAP
admitted
