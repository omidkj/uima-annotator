HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 34937**] is a 35-year-old
male with a history of HIV positivity with a CD4 count in the
200s recently and a viral load of 10,000, who is followed by
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 34938**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2916**] in this hospital.  The patient was transferred
to the [**Hospital1 69**] Intensive Care
Unit from [**Hospital6 3105**] for
hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic, nonketonic coma.  The patient was
brought to [**Hospital6 3105**] on [**2173-2-5**],
when he was found nonarousable in bed by his wife with
urinary incontinence.  He was intubated at the [**Hospital6 23267**] for airway protection.  On admission to
[**Hospital6 3105**] his serum glucose was 1060.  At
this time he was febrile to 103.5 degrees rectally.  The
heart rate was tachycardiac at 161 per minute.  Blood
pressure was 140s to 160s/90s.  He was breathing at 28 times
a minute and saturating to 99% to 100% on a nonrebreather
mask when he arrived at the [**Hospital6 3105**].  At
the [**Hospital6 3105**] the patient received five
liters of normal saline total and IV insulin for correction
of his hyperglycemia.  Over the next day, the patient's
glucose was corrected down to the 200s, but his serum sodium
started to rise up to a 167.  At this point, he was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
further medical care.

Upon retrospective history, the patient's wife reported that
he was not in his usual state of health a week prior to his
admission to [**Hospital6 3105**].  She noted that he
was confused at times and noted him to be "walking crooked."
She also noticed that he was urinating constantly and drank
six gallons of water a day.  He continued to deteriorate
until the morning of [**2-5**], when his wife found him in
bed and nonarousable with urinary incontinence and called an
ambulance.  After extubation, the patient was questioned
regarding his symptoms prior to the onset of his polyuria and
polydipsia.  The patient reported that he had had two to
three days of bloody diarrhea six to seven times a day prior
to the onset of his polyuria and polydipsia, which he in
fact, does not recollect.  He denied any cough, fevers,
chills, headaches, photophobia.  He denied any abdominal
pain, vomiting or nausea.  He denied any chest pain.  He
denied any sick contacts or any travel history.  He did not
eat anything unusual in the recent past.  The patient was at
this time on 60 mg of Prednisone a day for his mononeuritis
multiplex.  Because of his peripheral neuropathy he does walk
with a cane and he has hyperesthesias, which are controlled
by Neurontin.  The patient denied any history of elevated
blood sugars in the past.

Recent laboratory data was reviewed.  The glucose was normal,
as recently as [**2172-11-26**], when it was 106.

marriage.  His previous wife had died of cervical cancer.
The patient was originally from the [**Country 13622**] Republic.  He
is bilingual in English and Spanish.  His children are HIV
negative.  The only person who is aware of his HIV status is
his current wire.  The patient denied any tobacco use,
alcohol, or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission to the
hospital revealed the following:  The patient was intubated
and sedated.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 102.8, blood pressure
136/73, pulse 119, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation
100%.  The patient had post surgical pupils.  HEENT:
Patient's pupils are post surgical with right-side esotropia.
He was intubated and sedated.  He had normal dentition, no
thrush.  NECK:  Neck was supple.  CARDIOVASCULAR:
Examination revealed normal S1 and S2, sinus tachycardia and
regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs and no friction rubs.
RESPIRATORY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  ABDOMEN:
The abdomen is obese, protruding, which was soft, and did not
appear to be tender.  There was hypoactive bowel sounds
ausculted.  EXTREMITIES:  Examination revealed normal
extremities with no focal swelling.  The distal pulses were
all intact.  The skin was dry and warm.  NEUROLOGICAL:
Examination revealed intubated and sedated patient, who
responds to noxious stimuli.  Studies on admission revealed
sodium of 165, potassium of 4.4, chloride 129, bicarbonate
28, BUN 42, creatinine 1.7, sugar 140.  Serum calculated
osmolality was 352.  The patient's hematocrit was 38.9, white
count was 8.6 and the platelet count was 107.  The PT was
14.3, PTT 21.2.  The albumin was 3.9, calcium 9.3,
magnesium 2.4, phosphate 4.2, total bilirubin 0.5, AST of 79,
ALT 94.

Per report from the outside hospital, the patient has a
normal CT of his head.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from [**Hospital6 23267**] to the Medical Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 1444**].  On admission he was
hyponatremia and hyperosmolar.  He was placed on insulin
drip, given D5 and volume resuscitated with saline boluses.
Blood, urine, and spinal fluid cultures were also obtained
for workup of his fever.  The patient was empirically covered
with acyclovir, 2 grams Ceftriaxone q.12h., Ampicillin,
Flagyl, and Levofloxacin in the Intensive Care Unit.

Chest x-ray done on admission revealed possible left lower
lobe infiltrate in the retrocardiac window.  The patient also
received MRI of his head with gadolinium for careful look at
his pituitary for question of diabetes mellitus insipidus.
No structural abnormalities were noted in this MRI.

With repletion involving resuscitation, the patient's sodium
began to decrease.  His mental status also improved upon
weaning of his sedatives.  He was extubated successfully on
[**2173-2-8**].  At this time he remained febrile to a
temperature of 101.4.

On [**2-10**], the patient's sodium was corrected to a
normal level of 142.  He remained on an insulin drip at
around 10 units an hour.  He was converted to long-acting
insulin with NPH 60 units twice a day and transferred out to
the floor.

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient, on examination, was
found to have mild right lower quadrant tenderness on
palpation.

By [**2173-2-11**], AM labs had indicated that the
hematocrit was dropping from a baseline of 39 on admission to
the outside hospital to a hematocrit of 27 on [**2173-2-11**].  This was complicated by the fact that the patient is a
Jehovah witness.  He was also noted to have guaiac-positive
stool.  Given his history of bloody diarrhea, prior to his
presentation to the [**Hospital6 3105**],
guaiac-positive stool and dropping hematocrit, a CT scan of
his abdomen was done, which revealed severe cecal
inflammation.  The patient was made NPO and placed on IV
Ampicillin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  He was getting
Ceftriaxone at this time at 2 grams every 12 hours for
meningitic coverage.  Surgery Service was consulted to follow
the patient.

The patient did very well clinically over the next few days.
His diet was advanced as tolerated.

On [**2173-2-14**], he developed a low-grade temperature
overnight at 100.8 to 100.9 without clear source.
