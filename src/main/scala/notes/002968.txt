ECHO [**12-24**]:
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2119-9-25**], anteroseptal hypokinesis with focal apical
akinesis is now present.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2120-12-24**] 3:38 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions that are increased compared to
[**2120-7-30**].
2. Compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe with possible

superinfection.
3. ALthough limited by lack of contrast, esophageal-gastric
anastomosis
appears intact. Collapse of the distal esophagus and stomach,
which precludes evaluation for mass. Small amount of simple
fluid just distal to the anastomosis of uncertain clinical
significance.
4. No evidence of intra-abdominal fluid collection or abscess.
Interval loss of the subcutaneous fat plane in the left mid
abdomen.
.
[**2121-1-1**] CTA Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism.
2. Moderate pleural effusions, left greater than right. The left
effusion is slightly smaller. The right pleural effusion is
unchanged with persistent loculation laterally.
3. Unchanged right lower lobe consolidation.
4. Limited evaluation of the gastroesophageal pull-through and
of the upper abdomen. Specifically, evaluation for upper
abdominal lymphadenopathy is suboptimal.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 65 year old man with a history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia and esophageal ca s/p surgerical
intervention/chemo/radiation, admitted to the ICU with SOB,
fever, orthopnea.
.
#SOB/fever: CXR on admission with bibasilar opacities; left side
noted to be chronic.  CT chest from OSH and CT torso from
admission reviewed with unchanged pleural effusion, new RLL and
RML infiltrates. Also, difficult to track esophagus but still a
question of fistula or obstruction.  Additionally, BNP elevated
on admission and CHF was also considered (see below).  Patient
was initially started on VANC/levo/flag then switched to
Levo/flagyl to cover for aspiration pneumonia.
.
A thoracentesis was performed to alleviate some of his SOB/O2
requirement and assess for a malignant effusion.  Pleural fluid
was negative for malignancy, but recurrence was still highly
suspected with elevated CEA and continued weight loss.  A trial
of prednisone was started for his SOB and appetite.  He did well
and will continue a taper.  He currently requires 3L O2.
.
Given tenuous status and discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] about
likely cancer recurrence, patient decided to shift goals of care
to comfort oriented care.  He was given morphine as needed for
SOB.  Still prescribing meds for comfort.  He decided to work
toward hospice.
.
#CAD- BNP elevated on admission. ECHO showed interval change
from previous with
moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent).
 Cardiac enzymes were negative.
.
#Esophageal ca:  Paitent reported extensive weight loss and
diminished appetite.  Oncology was consulted; CEA noted to be
elevated at 90.  Given concern for possible malignant
recurrance, pt was transferred to the oncology service once
stable.
.
# Nutrition: Speech and swallow felt he was too ill for inital
evaluation.  He was made NPO for concern of aspiration risk.
Dobhoff tube was placed via IR due to anatomy of his espohagus.
Pt was started on tube feeds.  Speech and swalloe re-evaluated
on floor and clear patient for full diet.  The dobhoff tube was
pulled.  Nutrition recomended calorie counts and ensure
suplements.
.
# Acute likely systolic CHF: Patient with new diagnosis of CHF
with pleural effusion and EF of 30%. He was diuresed until his
Cr elevated slightly, but his effusions remained.  He was then
only diuresed for symtom management.
.
# Anemia: Iron studies consistent with ACD
.
# Goals of care: as noted above, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] discussed
likelyhood of recurrence of cancer given elevated CEA and
continued loss of appetite and weight.  The patient decided to
be DNR/DNI and to move towards hospice.  He will be discharged
to [**Last Name (un) 72158**] house.
