Chief Complaint:
Right Subdural Hematoma

History of Present Illness:
69 male w/ PMHx sig for HTN, COPD, dementia, afib on coumadin
who presents as a transfer from OSH for evaluation of SDH.  The
patient is a farmer from northern MA.  He was pushed into a
stall by a cow several months ago and broke ribs.  Over the last
several days he has appeared more confused and bumping into
things.  He was brought to an OSH where CT scan of the head
showed a large R frontotemporal acute on chronic SDH with
complete effacement of R lateral ventricle.  The patient was
given oral vitamin K and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ER, he was given IV vitamin K, FFP, and profiline was
initiated.

Imaging:
Head CT [**3-16**]:
Large (2.2 cm) right subdural hematoma with acute hemorrage
superimposed on
apparently more subacute collection. Subfalcine herniation with
1.5 cm shift
to left of midline structures. Compression of right lateral
ventricle,
slight dilation of left lateral ventricle, especially temporal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] (possible
entrapment). Given these findings, high risk for transtentorial
herniation.

Head CT [**3-17**]:
FINDINGS: There has been interval evacuation of a large
right-sided subdural hematoma, with moderate-sized
pneumocephalus in the subdural space, causing  mass effect on
the right cerebral hemisphere. There is 1.1 cm subfalcine
herniation, slightly less than the prior measurement of 1.5 cm.
There is persistent 1.2 cm right subdural collection along the
dependent portion of the subdural space, compared to prior
measurement of 2.2 cm. There is no intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
There is no intraventricular hemorrhage. There is compression of
the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle from mass effect
due to the large pneumocephalus. There is effacement of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and
white matter differentiation in the right frontal lobe as a
consequence of mass
effect and associated mild parenchymal edema. Remainder of the
brain
demonstrates good [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation without major
vascular territorial infarct. The basilar cisterns continued to
be preserved. Left-
sided sulci and ventricles are mildly prominent, may represent
nvolutionary
changes. Right frontoparietal craniotomy with surgical staples
is noted. Small amount of subcutaneous air is also noted in the
right scalp soft tissues.
IMPRESSION: Interval evacuation of the large right subdural
hematoma with a
moderate-sized pneumocephalus and a residual 1.2 cm subdural
collection
causing mass effect and approximately 1.2 cm leftward subfalcine
herniation, improved since prior study.
NOTE AT ATTENDING REVIEW: While the present scan is markedly
angulated, I
believe there is continued right sided uncal herniation, shown
better on the preoperative study.

Head CT [**3-24**]:
FINDINGS: Allowing for the differences in the angulation of the
patient's
head, there is no significant change in the size or appearance
of the large subdural hematoma along the right convexity. The
hematoma contains a
combination of acute and chronic blood products. There is no
evidence of new acute blood products. Previously noted
pneumocephalus within the collection has slightly decreased.
Associated compression of the right frontal and parietal gyri is
unchanged, with unchanged right subfalcine herniation and
moderate shift of normally midline structures to the left. The
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], body, and occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral
ventricle remains compressed. The temporal horns of both lateral
ventricles remain dilated. The third ventricle remains displaced
to the left. There is no evidence of a new acute major vascular
territorial infarction. Evidence of a right frontal/parietal
craniotomy is again seen. Overlying right subgaleal soft tissue
swelling is again noted.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change.


Brief Hospital Course:
69M admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for right sided subdural hematoma.  Of
significance, patient is on chronic coumadin therapy for atrial
fibrillation.  Approx 3 months prior to admission, the patient
was involved in a collision with a cow.  He recounts no symptoms
until approximatley three days prior to admission when be began
to experience progressive lethargy.  Head CT was performed
revealing a right subdural hematoma.  He was taken to the OR for
open craniotomy for subdural evacuation. Post-operatively he was
kept in the ICU until POD#2.  He received multiple doses of
lasix for what appeared to be mild congestive heart failure. He
was then transferred to the neurosurgical step down unit for
continued monitoring.

On [**3-22**] in the evening the patient became tachypneic and had a
fever of 101. He also reported SOB. A fever workup was started
which was negative for any infectious process.

He has been neurologically stable. However, from the cardiac
point of view he did develop rapid AF (150 bpm) for periods of 2
to 3 hours. He did not respond to metoprolol 100 XL qd and
Dofetilide 125 mcg q12h. Cardiology was consulted and
recommended increasing the dose to 250 mcg q12h. His HR ranges
from 80 to 90 bpm. Most of the time he is in SR, however, he is
going in and out of AF on a daily basis. As discussed with
cardiology, we need to monitor the patient till  [**3-26**]. If he
does not convert to steady sinus rhythm, he will need to be
loadad on amiodarone while stopping Dofetilide. The idea has
been to rhythm control given that we cannot anticoagulate the
patient now. Cardiology offered clearance for rehab disposition
on [**3-26**] and follow up was arranged with the patient's
cardiologist.
