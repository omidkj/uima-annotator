Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
headaches --> brain mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC Line placement
Ganciclovir implant placed in L eye on [**7-1**] to treat CMV


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 29 yo man with a PMH of HIV/AIDS (last CD4 3,
viral load > 1,000,000) complicated by poor compliance with
HAART medications, diarrhea and esophageal candidiasis, IV drug
use (heroin and crack), and Hep. C who initially presented to
OSH with fever, headache x 4days, N/V, decreased po intake and
lethargy requiring intubation for airway protection.  The
patient was subsequently found to have a right frontal lesion
with vasogenic edema and 9mm midline shift. He was transferred
from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2179-6-22**] given intracranial mass lesion.
.
In brief, Mr.[**Known lastname **] was initially treated in the Neuro ICU with
mannitol and dexamethasone taper for cerebral edema. He was
continued on empiric toxoplasmosis treatment with pyrimethamine
(200mg PO x 1) 50mg PO daily, sulfadiazine 1000mg PO Q6, and
leucovorin 10mg PO daily. Also shortly after admission ([**6-24**]),
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was started on a HAART regimen of truvada, ritonavir
and darunavir. He had a ganciclovir implant placed in L eye on
[**7-1**] for CMV retinitis.  There was also question of RLL
pneumonia, which was covered by empiric vancomycin and
ceftriaxone course initially.  Other medications include
azithromycin, fluconazole and valganciclovir. He was extubated
on [**6-23**] with improvement in mental status.  Overall, his
toxoplasmosis is getting better with treatment, and repeat
imaging reveals that midline shift has improved.  His hospital
course has been complicated by hyponatremia, fevers,
tachycardia, and diarrhea.  Renal was consulted for his
hyponatremia that has been poorly responsive to fluid
restrictions (now on 750 mL/day).  ID has also been consulted
for his spiking fevers and persistent tachycardia, which they
believe can be attributed to [**Doctor First Name **].  GI was consulted for his
diarrhea ([**7-15**] BMs per day) that began after hospital admission,
and the patient underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy with negative
work-up.  The diarrhea has since improved, and the patient
currently reports only one BM per day.
.
On transfer to the medicine floor, the patient was stable and
able to converse.  He had no complaints of headaches.

Pertinent Results:
                            **FINAL REPORT [**2179-6-22**]**

   TOXOPLASMA IgG ANTIBODY (Final [**2179-6-22**]):
      POSITIVE FOR TOXOPLASMA IgG ANTIBODY BY EIA.
      >300 IU/ML.
      Reference Range:  Negative < 4 IU/ml, Positive >= 8 IU/ml.


   TOXOPLASMA IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2179-6-22**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR TOXOPLASMA IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
      INTERPRETATION:  INFECTION AT UNDETERMINED TIME.
      A positive IgG result generally indicates past exposure.
      Infection with Toxoplasma once contracted remains latent
and may
      reactivate when immunity is compromised.
      If current infection is suspected, submit follow-up serum
in [**3-12**]
      weeks.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2179-6-22**]**

   CRYPTOCOCCAL ANTIGEN (Final [**2179-6-22**]):
      CRYPTOCOCCAL ANTIGEN NOT DETECTED.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by latex agglutination.
      A negative serum does not rule out localized or
disseminated
      cryptococcal infection.
      Appropriate specimens should be sent for culture.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2179-6-23**]**

   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2179-6-23**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other
L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may
vary.

MRI head with and without contrast ([**2179-6-22**]):
IMPRESSION:  2.1 x 2.3 cm rim-enhancing lesion with irregular
walls, centered in the right gangliocapsular region with mass
effect over the right lateral ventricle and 1 cm midline shift
to the left.  This lesion demonstrates an area of slow
diffusion, which is not present in the center of this lesion.
Findings may represent lymphoma or an infectious process such as
toxoplasmosis or TB.
.
TTE ([**2179-6-23**]):
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue
Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild right
ventricular cavity enlargement with low normal systolic
function. Normal left ventricular cavity size and
regional/global systolic function.

Tallium SPECT brain ([**2179-6-25**]):
IMPRESSION:  1. There is a relatively low level thallium uptake
in the lesion in the right cerebral hem
