Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower extremity edema.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Joint aspiration, right knee ([**2159-5-8**]).
2. Hydrocortisone injection, right knee ([**2159-5-9**]).
3. s/p ORIF
4. Intubation


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 73yo F w/ PMH of HTN, ESRD on HD, diastolic dysfunction,
who presented to the ED with increased BLE edema. Her LE have
been getting more and more edematous, to the point where she is
unable to wear her shoes. She is now on rehab with the purpose
of getting her functional enough to undergo a R TKR (per the
patient). At rehab, she has been limited due to her LE edema.
Her R knee has been more painful and more swollen over last
month. No h/o trauma or falls. She denies any recent fevers or
chills and has not had swelling this bad in her knees in the
past. They have been trying to run her dry at HD, but the
swelling persists. Denies any recent CP, SOB. + palpitations.
Sleeps on 3 pillows behind her head and 2 underneath her feet,
which is stable. Mild DOE - has 15 stairs to climb at her house,
sometimes has to sit between flights. No n/v recently. Still w/
profuse diarrhea. Swelling in LE as noted above.
.
Pt was recently admitted [**4-13**] - [**4-24**] with diagnosis of AF with
RVR, abd pain and distention, as well as an elevated INR.
Briefly, she was rate controlled with IV and PO medicines, had a
paracentesis for ascites felt to be due to CHF induced hepatic
congestion, and then ultimately found to have C diff for which
she was treated with PO vanco/flagyl. There was a question of
mesenteric ischemia vs. IBD as well, given that she frequently
had bloody stools. It was recommended to undergo a colonoscopy
as an outpatient for further evaluation. She continues on PO
vanco, to finish her course on [**5-8**].
.
In the ED, VS showed T 98.4, BP 120/60, HR 75, RR 20, sats 99%
on RA. Arthrocentesis was performed on her R knee. She was given
morphine for pain relief. CXR was performed. Labs revealed a BNP
of 54K. She was admitted to medicine for management of her CHF.

CARDIAC STUDIES:   [**2159-5-7**]
CK-MB-2 cTropnT-0.23* proBNP-[**Numeric Identifier 22636**]*

CXR ([**2159-5-8**]):
Long-standing severe cardiomegaly, particularly left atrial and
right ventricular enlargement is unchanged. Pulmonary
vasculature is unremarkable and there is no edema or pleural
effusion. Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries suggests
pulmonary hypertension perhaps related to mitral valve disease.
Lungs are clear of any focal abnormality. Stomach is moderately
distended with gas.

RIGHT KNEE PLAIN FILM ([**2159-5-8**]):
1. There are severe osteoarthritic changes comparable in
appearance to [**1-5**].
2. The degree of lateral subluxation of the tibia is less than
on that study.
3. No acute fracture is identified, although there is
considerable preexisting deformity of the subarticular bone.
.
ct pelvis [**5-10**]:
IMPRESSION: Minimally impacted fracture through the
intertrochanteric region of the proximal right femur
.
[**5-13**] head ct:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or
shift of normally midline structures. There is no evidence of
infarction. Mild low attenuation in the periventricular white
matter is consistent with chronic microvascular infarction. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. The surrounding
soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect. No
significant change from prior study

Brief Hospital Course:
Floor course:
1. Femeral neck fracture:  The patient fell morning of [**5-10**].
Plain film shows fracture.  On [**5-11**]: ORIF with ortho, and on
[**5-12**]: Hct drop post-op with clear hematoma in right leg.  The
patient was given blood with no issues
.
2. Congestive heart failure:  Presented with elevated BNP of
~54K, LE edema, and crackles on exam, but pt had stable O2 sats
on RA. Unclear that this was true CHF exacerbation because she
appeared dry on exam. Per HD notes, pt has been getting dialyzed
to below her dry weight (59.5 kg -> 55.5 kg on [**5-4**]).  She
remained stable with HD M/W/F and renal meds
.
3. Gout:  WBC in tap elevated with 96% polys, but gram stain w/o
PMNs or orgs. Afebrile, no peripheral leukocytosis. Crystals are
c/w gout and/or pseudogout. Was injected by rheum on [**5-9**], and
did well with tylenol prn.  Was not given colchicine given ESRD

.
4. Hypertension: The patient was continue on outpatient
antihypertensives, with no issues
.
5. ESRD: The patient had no issues on the floor and had HD on
MWF.
.
6. CDIFF: Completed course of PO vancomycin for now.
.
Micu transfer and course:
Code blue called late [**5-12**] for unresponsiveness, pt's blood
sugar was found to be 8. Bradycardia down to thirties, sbp
dropped as low as 80s. Given atropine one mg x1 and [**1-2**] amp D50.
HR recovered to 90s-110s, irreg rhythm. Repeat sugar 47 and a
full amp D50 was given. During the code a central line was
placed in L femoral. Her mental status returned to baseline and
pt transferred to MICU for further management.
.
The patient was initially stable in the unit, but during her
course she developed several hypotensive episodes and received
boluses of IVF. The patient was on diltiazem and meto
