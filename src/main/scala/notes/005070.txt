Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Status Asthmaticus / Respiratory failure:  Pt was
transferred intubated (on steroids and paralytics), started on
125 mg IV solumedrol, emperic antibiotics (levofloxacin and
vancomycin), mdi's (q2-4 hours) and aggressive suctioning.  His
paralytics were discontinued.  The pt remained bronchospastic
and quite difficult to ventilate and oxygenate during this
hospitalization.  His secretions were thick and difficult to
suction, requiring 4 bronchoscopies.  He also had a negative CTA
for acute PE.  Subsequent to these therapeutic bronchoscopies,
his oxygenation temporarily improved, for, on average, 24 hours.
 He is now on PO prednisone and will continue nebs, and
linezolid for a total of 14 days.

2.  MRSA:  The pt also had florid 3+ MRSA growing from sputum
cultures and BAL's.  He was treated with vancomycin, then
linezolid for this.  His WBC count elevated to a max of 42 with
a significant bandemia and left shift, including myelocytes and
promeylocytes.  Hematology was consulted and evaluated his
peripheral smear, which showed no evidence of myeloproliferative
disorder.  This leukomoid reaction was attributed to a
combination of steroids and MRSA tracheobronchitis.  He had an
extensive workup including numerous chest CT's, abdominal CT,
head CT, sinus CT, CTA.  The pt's leukocytosis and low grade
fevers were not resolving on vancomycin and ID recomended
linezolid for better pulmonary penetrence.  He was also treated
emperically for C.diff colitis with PO flagyl, but this was
eventually stopped after numerous negative C.diff stool assays
(however, he still has a C.diff toxin pending that was a send
out lab).  On linezolid, the pt defervesced after 4 days, and
his leukocytosis resolved (of note, this is also when the pt's
IV solumedrol was rapidly tapered and eventually switched to PO
prednisone).  Currently pt is without signs/symptoms of active
infection, although he does still have some watery secretions.
ID also recommended imipenim to cover emperically for gram
negative bacteria, for a 7 day course.

3.  Steroid Myopathy:  Once the pt was extubated, he was found
to be extremely weak, not able to lift his hands, arms, legs,
feet or head from the bed. This was attributed to steroid
myopathy, with CK's >1000.  He was not treated emperically for
rhabdomyolesis because his CK's were not at the level one would
expect in rhabdo (i.e. > [**Numeric Identifier 961**]) and he had no associated
electrolyte abnormalities.  He will need extensive PT/OT to help
get back to his independant status.  His myopathy appears to be
dose-dependant to steroids and is now improving daily.  The pt
did have a previous episode of similar weakness after being
intubated for a prolonged period also.

4.  Hyperglycemia:  Pt developed steroid induced hyperglycemia
while in the MICU.  He was covered effectively with insulin drip
and then SC insulin SS when the dosage decreased.

5.  Access:  Pt had an A-line, Right and Left subclavian lines
placed during his MICU stay.  Now, he still has a R-SC line for
antibiotics (imipenim).  Will contact ID and discuss the
possibility of stopping imipenim today (day [**5-4**]) so this line
can come out (it was placed 5 days ago).

6. Anemia:  Hct down to 30.  Pt developed occultly heme positive
stools after he was extubated.  This was thought to be due to
stress-gastritis, uncompletely covered with PPI.  He will be
D/C'd with PO protonix 40 mg po QD.  No transfusion
requirements.  No longer heme positive.

7. Tachycardia:  Pt developed a tachycardia during his MICU
stay.  This was thought to be due to
