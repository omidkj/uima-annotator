Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemolytic Anemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CVL - right IJ
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Per admit note:
76 year old Female with chronic hemolytic anemia and
pancytopenia, intermittant fevers transferred from [**Hospital **] center on [**2145-6-23**] with shortness of breath, weakness,
and arthralgias as well as chest tightness. Subsequently
developed fevers to 102 intermittantly. Her workup included bone
marrow biopsies, echo, CT, hematology consultation.

Per her transfer paperwork she was transfused blood and platelet
products, but has remained pancytopenic. She has developed
multiple antibodies, making transfusions more complicated.

As per resident note: Per OSH records, patient's issues began in
[**2145-3-6**] at which time she presented to Catholic MC with
SOB. She was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and nodules on
CT chest, negative for PE. She was also found to be anemic and
thrombocytopenic with HCT in the high 20s and platelets in the
low 100s, new since [**3-12**]. She was treated with IV Avelox and
discharged on PO Avelox. When antibiotics were stopped, she had
recurrence of symptoms and was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] MC and
transfered to Catholic MC. Blood cultures were postive for
pseudomonas and ECHO negative for endocarditis. CT continued to
show lung nodules and LUL infiltrated. Recieved zosyn,
gentamycin, vancomycin, amikacin and linezolid and had
persistent thrombocytopenia and anemia in spite of multiple
blood transfusions. Coombs test was initially negative but
became positive. She developed additional antibodies and
evidence of hemolysis with increased LDH and retic count.
Evidence of hepatosplenomegaly. She was discharged from that
admission with hematocrit of 24-31. Platelets in the 70s-100s.
She was then readmitted showtly after with flank pain and
discharged. Then in [**Month (only) **] was still thrombocytopenic with plt
90s, and anemic with Hct of 24-27. She had C. diff colitis in
[**Month (only) **]. She then presented to her PCPs office on [**6-23**] at which
time she was sent to the ED at Catholic MC as above.

[**7-22**] Echo:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the entire distal two-thirds of the left
ventricle, and relative preservation of the basal one-third
(LVEF <20%). This is consistent with either an extensive
infarction or transient apical ballooning syndrome ("Takosubo
cardiomyopathy"). No left ventricular thrombus is seen. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction as described above. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-7-20**],
left ventricular systolic function has significantly
deteriorated, and severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation
is greater.
Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 1700 hours on the day
of the study.

Brief Hospital Course:
76F with compliacted PMH, with new dx large Bcell lymphoma c/b
hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, who was transfered to ICU
for hypotension on [**7-22**] and died on [**7-23**].
.
Brief hospital course:
Course c/b hyponatremia and oliguria.  She was hypotensive on
floor with SBPs in the 80s.  She was third-spacing NS so was
given albumin for fluid resuscitation.  This seemed to maintain
her SBPs and renal perfusion.  W/u during hosp included skin bx
which proved malignant as well as news that onc w/u revealed
lymphoma.  She also was noted to have profound pancytopenia w
hemolytic anemia.
.
On evening of [**7-21**], she began complaining of chest pain around
11 pm.  On EKG, there were no ST changes or TWI, but there was
loss of R wave progression.  HR was in the HR 120's and she was
given lopressor.  She has had three sets of cardiac enzymes
(trop 0.01 --> 0.61 --> 0.48; CK 36 --> 50 --> 50), and she was
seen by cardiology.  Given concers for ACS, she was started on
heparin gtt.  She also received albumin and NS overnight for
hypotension.
.
On morning of [**7-22**], she was hypotensive to SBP low 70s.  Started
on neo and transferred to the ICU.  En route, she also received
a blood transfusion for HCT 24.  On arrival to ICU, there was
initial concern for a distributive shock, possibly infectious.
She had fever the night prior, appeared dry, and was
vasodilated.  She finished unit of blood and received IVF and
broad abx.  Shortly thereafter, she experienced CP and acute
SOB.  CXR and exam c/w pulm edema.  Placed on NRB and started on
nitro gtt.  Pain was controlled.  Cards evaluated and recommened
stat echo.  It showed new anterior wall hypo/akinesis of LV.
Cardiogenic shock was considered strongly as etiology of
hypotension.  At same time, pt was complaining of lower bilat
abd pain.  Exam fairly benign but we were concerned about
mesenteric ischemia, RP bleed, or other acute process.
