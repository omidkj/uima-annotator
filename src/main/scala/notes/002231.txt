History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 55941**] is an 85 yo female with recent hospitalization for
C. diff colitis (from [**Date range (1) 29129**]/08; discharged to rehab; sent
home on [**2141-5-31**]).  Today she presented from home with rigors and
diarrhea.  The diarrhea has been non-bloody and began 2-3 days
ago; it has not been associated with abd pain/cramping or
nausea/vomiting.  This morning she developed rigors and a fever
of 100.7.

In the ED, she was febrile to 102, SBP was in the 80's
initially, and lactate was 3.8.  She was started on
vanco/levo/flagyl.  She was given 2L NS but blood pressure
remained in the 70 - 80's systolic; a right IJ was placed and
she was placed on a code sepsis, with initiation of levophed.

Of note, on presentation at the last admission, there was
concern for ischemic bowel initially, and she was started on IV
flagyl/vanco and cipro.  She was taken off the flagyl and cipro
once stool studies were returned with C. diff, and she completed
a two week course of PO vanco for the C. diff (ended on
[**2141-5-30**]).  Her course then was c/b hypotension in the 80's, for
which she received IVF but was never on pressors.  Prior to the
[**Month (only) **] hospitalization, she was on Keflex x 1 week for an infected
left toe, as well as doxycycline for Lyme disease.

IMAGING:
[**2141-6-8**] ADMISSION CXR:
No acute cardiopulmonary process. Poorly aerated retrocardiac
region, limiting evaluation of left lower lobe. Lateral views
would aid further evaluation.
.
[**2141-6-9**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
1. Findings consistent with pseudomembraneous colitis. No
pneumoperitoneum or marked dilatation of the transverse colon to
establish toxic megacolon, but clinical correlation is
important.
2. Fibroid uterus, including a cavitating fibroid, but of
doubtful clinical significance.

[**2141-6-14**] TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated cardiac
index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Cannot exclude mild aortic
stenosis, but this does not appear to be severe. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-5-15**], the
findings are similar.
.
[**2141-6-23**] CT CHEST: Persistent, extensive, and severe emphysema is
observed. There is increase in the bilateral effusion with
moderate atelectatic changes as compared to the previous CT. The
NG tube and endotracheal tubes are seen in place. There are mild
left lower lobe infiltrative changes. Two right lower lobe
non-calcified pulmonary nodules are seen, which are 6 mm in size
(series 2, image 40).
.
[**6-27**] CXR: Worsening pulmonary vascular congestion with probable
bilateral
pleural effusions.
.
