History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 92101**] is a 60 year old woman with cirrhosis [**3-13**] methotrexate
(for psoriatic arthritis) and hepatitis C who initially
presented with acute on chronic renal failure; her course has
been complicated by UTI, bacteremia, respiratory distress
requiring ICU transfer as well as worsening ARF requiring HD who
is now stable for call out of the ICU to the floor.
.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**3-8**] to [**2186-3-14**]
for an infected bullae. The patient was then discharged to
rehab, where she was feeling well and had no specific
complaints. The patient had routine labs drawn on [**4-3**], which a
Cr of 3.0 (baseline 1.8-2.0).
.
On admission she was found to have a UTI which grew Pseudomonas,
Klebsiella, and ESBL E. coli on straight cath. She was initially
treated with first with Unasyn but developed a diffuse rash. She
was then switched to aztreonam due to allergies to
cephalosporins, penicillins, and fluoroquinolones but the
culture ultimately grew resistent ESBL Ecoli and Pseudomonas.
She was switched to meropenem but developed diffuse erythroderma
with eosinophilia after 3 days. The meropenem was stopped but a
repeat UA and Cx was notable only for yeast and no signs of
ongoing infection. She then became increasingly encephalopathic
and developed a fever. Her blood cultures grew coag negative
Staph x3 bottles and she was started on vancomycin. She also
being treated for hepatorenal syndrome with albumin, midodrine,
and octreotide. Unfortunately her renal function continued to
decline and it was felt that she would need HD. The renal team
was unable to place an HD cath at the bedside on Friday [**2186-4-14**].
She has some post procedure bleeding and was transfused 2U pRBC
the following day. She developed respiratory distress thought to
be due to volume overload on Sat [**4-15**]. ABG on RA 7.36/27/63. She
did not respond to lasix 80 IV, and was therefore transferred to
the ICU.
.
In the ICU a nitro gtt was initiated with relief of her
distress. On [**4-16**], the patient self d/c'd her PICC line. An IR
guided temporary HD cath with a VIP port was placed. She
underwent her first dialysis session on [**2186-4-17**]. She developed a
large hemorrhagic bulla at the site of her HD cath. DDAVP was
given. Hemolysis labs were difficult to interpret in the setting
of ESLD. Wound care was consulted. Her O2 was weaned to 2L NC
(from 4L). Blood culture from [**2186-4-15**] grew VRE and her
antibiotics were changed to Dapto. She also was noted to have AM
hypoglycemia so her evening glargine was decreased to 10U from
20U. Her course has further been complicated by ongoing
encephalopathy which responded to lactulose.
.
On the floor now she is comfortable on 2L NC but remains
encephalopathic. She has no particular complaints but is A&O x
1. She continues to require HD with poor UOP.
