History of Present Illness:
This 87 year old gentleman has a history significant for aortic

lower leg and left forearm.

Due to concern about these symptoms, the patient was seen by his
PCP and an echo was done on [**2163-3-8**]. This report is not
presently
available, however it reportedly revealed worsening aortic
stenosis. The patient was referred for catheterization to
further evaluate need for AVR and possbly CABG.

 On [**2163-3-11**] patient [**Date Range 1834**] cardiac cath which revealed a
tight stenosis in LCx and RCA. It was therefore decided that he
would undergo both CABG for his CAD as well as AVR for his
severe AS complicated by CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
A cardiac catheterization was performed on [**2163-3-11**] which
demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease. On [**2163-3-11**]
carotids were performed and revealed less than 40% stenosis on
the right and 70-79% on the left.  Dental clearance was
obtained.  He was seen by podiatry for right 2nd digit pain and
an abscess was drained at bedside.  He was seen by speech and
swallow and found to have mild dysphagia.  He was seen by wound
care for a right lower leg ulcer which has been healing poorly.
Adaptic was recommended to be placed on the wound.  He was
placed on Kefzol for thrombophlebitis on his right upper
extremity. On [**2163-3-16**] Mr. [**Known lastname 43400**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a coronary artery
bypass grafting times two and an aortic valve replacement with a
27mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Porcine valve.  He tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the
surgical intensive care unit.
Mr. [**Known lastname 43400**] was weaned from the ventilator and extubated without
difficulty. His pacing wires were removed on POD#2 since he has
his own internal pacer.
He was transferred from the ICU to the floor on POD#2. He was
started on coumadin  for baseline atrial fibrillation which he
was in prior to surgery and betablocker and diuretics.  His
platelet count was noted to be steadily declining. His
medications were reviewed and zantac d/c'd. A HIT panel was
negative. His chest tubes were removed on POD#3. Hematocrit and
platelets are recovering.  Mr. [**Known lastname 43400**] was evaluated by physical
therapy and rehab was recomended.  The patient was found stable
for discharge to rehab on POD 5.
