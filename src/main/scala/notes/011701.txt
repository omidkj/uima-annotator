Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
asthma exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 33419**] is a 48 year old female with history of asthma and
COPD, requiring intubations and ICU admissions in the past.  She
reports feeling progressively short of breath for the past 3
days with associated cough productive of clear phlegm, runny
nose, sinus pressure, no associated fevers, no known sick
contacts though she does live with her granddaughter. She feels
her breathing acutely decompensated yesterday after her daughter
was using nail polish. At home, she is on Singulair, Advair
500/50 [**Hospital1 **] and albuterol PRN. At her baseline, she uses the
albuterol 2x/week, though she has used it increasingly over the
past several days, 6 times this morning with no relief. She was
seen by PCP in [**Month (only) 359**] with complaints of productive cough,
wheezing, increasing dyspnea on exertion. She was put on a
prednisone taper and a course of azithromycin at that time.
.
In the ED inital vitals were 98.8 82 133/83 18 87% on RA. She
was treated wtih multiple albuterol nebulizer treatments (6
total), ipratropium nebs (3 total),  2mg magnesium, prednisone
60mg and 125mg solumedrol. On exam, patient was noted to have
bilateral expiratory wheezes, increased work of breathing, inc
E/I ratio, some accessory muscle use. Patient was noted to be
getting tired and she was started on BiPap in the ED. Prior to
transfer, vitals were 131/80 101 22 95% bipap 50% O2, 5 peep, 5
pressure support.
.
She is followed by pulmonary here and was most recently seen by
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) 547**]. She had a CT scan
[**6-/2168**] for workup of a pulmonary lesion seen on prior cxray. CT
at that time revealed right basilar scarring with minimal
post-aspiration / post-infectious changes in the right lower
lobe, no evidence of pulmonary nodules. She also had a sleep
study performed with recommendations for CPAP. Her most recent
spirometry from [**Month (only) 547**] revealed FEV1/FVC 70.
 She reports multiple exacerbations yearly, most recently
required hospitalization 3-4 months ago. She has been intubated
3 times in the past, 5-10 years ago.
.
On the floor, she reports continued feelings of tightness when
breathing, though improved significantly from admission. She is
tolerating BiPap well and reports feeling comfortable.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Asthma exacerbation: Patient has long history of asthma and
has required ICU stays with intubation in the past. Because of
her increased work of breathing and poor response to nebulizers,
magnesium and steroids, she was initiated on BiPap. She required
continuous nebulizers for several hours but was able to be
weaned to nasal cannula. Suspect trigger may be viral as patient
had prodromal illness for several days, with acute trigger of
environmental exposure to acetone odor from nail polish. Viral
respiratory cultures negative. At baseline, patient's oxygen
saturation appears to be 92-95%.  She received 2 days of IV
steroids before being transitioned to PO prednisone. She will
require slow day taper given severity of initial presentation.
She was also started on a 5 day azithromycin course.
- taper prednisone, complete azithromycin course
- wrote for advair at patient's request, as well as ProAir
.
# leukocytosis:  Developed on HD3, likely secondary to steroids.
Patient has no fever, but will add diff and check UA to ensure
no other infectious process.  Normalizing by discharge
.
# hypothyroidism: continued home synthroid 125mcg daily
.
# Drug abuse: continued home methadone 65mg daily and clonidine
0.2mg [**Hospital1 **]
.
# depression: patient has been off prozac for several months now
and feels that her mood is good. Will continue to monitor.
.
# diabetes: pt with history of steroid induced diabetes in the
past. Will monitor sugars daily; if elevated, will start on SSI
with fingersticks, which were normal in house.
.
# OSA: continued home CPAP overnight
