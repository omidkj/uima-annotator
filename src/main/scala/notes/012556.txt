Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
NSTEMI, CHF exacerbation, left leg ischemia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
embolectomy
intubation and extubation
placement and removal of central line
placement and removal of swan catheter
placement and removal of arterial line
Cardiac catherization


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 82 year old female with history of systolic CHF
(EF 30%), hypertension, status post pacemaker placement for
Mobitz II, who presented to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital via EMS the night
of [**5-12**] with left leg pain.  Per report, she developed acute
shortness of breath en route.  She was in respiratory distress
on presentation, with exam and chest x-ray consistent with
pulmonary edema.  EKG showed a paced rhythm with no obvious
signs of ischemia.  She was started on BiPAP and treated with
nitropaste, Lasix 80mg x 1, then Lasix 160mg IV x 1.  Her leg
was noted to be mottled with no palpable pulses.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to the Vascular Surgery service for further
management.  On [**5-13**], she was intubated and underwent left
femoral embolectomy with subsequent achievement of [**Name (NI) **]
PT and DP pulses.  After the procedure, she was admitted to the
CVICU on neosynephrine and IV heparin.  Cardiology was consulted
for CHF management and elevated troponin.  TTE showed EF 30%,
anterior septal/free wall hypokinesis, apical akinesis, and
question of LV thrombus.  She was started on carvedilol and IV
Lasix for CHF management.  Her neosynephrine gtt was changed to
dopamine.  She has also had persistent fevers postprocedure (Tm
102.4) and was started on Zosyn and vancomycin.  She was
pancultured, and her sputum culture shows 4+ GNRs on Gram stain.
 Her dopamine was weaned off.  She has been maintained on an
insulin drip.
.
Unable to obtain full review of symptoms due to
intubation/sedation.  She complains of some throat pain, denies
pain anywhere else.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
.
EKG ([**5-13**], 2:30p) demonstrated V-paced rhythm 64bpm, biphasic T
waves II/III/F/V3, TWIs V4-V6.
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: V-paced 70bpm
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**5-13**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. No
definite masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle;
however, the presence of a small apical thrombus cannot be
excluded with certainty. LV systolic function appears depressed
(moderate-to-severe) secondary to hypokinesis of the anterior
septum, anterior free wall, and lateral wall; the apex is
akinetic. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.

.
FDG MYOCARDIAL VIABILITY
INTERPRETATION:
No prior studies are available.

The perfusion images, performed only at rest, show a moderate
myocardial
perfusion defect of the septum and distal anterior wall. The
F-18 FDG images
show radiotracer uptake which is more uniform than the perfusion
images,
including in the areas of reduced perfusion, an appearance which
signifies
ischemic but viable myocardium.

IMPRESSION: Evidence for ischemic but viable myocardium along
the distal
anterior wall and septum.
.
Cardiac Catherization:

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated
two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA and RCA had no
angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.  The LAD had a
30%
ostial stenosis, a 40% mid-vessel stenosis, and a 70% Diagonal-2

stenosis.  The LCx had a 40% ostial stenosis.  The ramus
intermedius had
a 50% stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 166/77
mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 82 year old female with history of systolic
congestive heart failure (EF30%), hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
who present with subacute myocardial infarction (possibly
embolic), decompensated CHF, and lef leg ischemia.
.
# CAD/Ischemia:  Patient was admitted with what was felt to be
an acute myocardial infarction with a peak Troponin at [**Hospital1 18**] of
0.28.  TTE with anterior septal/free wall HK, but there was no
prior TTE for comparison.  A cardiac embolus was the likely
source for her leg ischemia.  However, no definite thrombus was
seen on TTE.  She was maintained on a heparin gtt.  A myocardial
perfusion scan showed evidence of ischemic but viable myocardium
along the same distribution as the hypokinesis noted on her
echo. Based on the findings noted on her myocardial viability
study, she underwent cardiac catherization, which did not reveal
any flow limiting or significant disease.
It was felt that the combination of extreme stress she
experience prior to admission, stemming from being distraught
over her granddaughter, in conjunction with possible embolic
event, led to the myocardial ischemia.
At time of discharge she was maintained on a full strength
aspirin, high dose statin, beta-blocker, and ace-inhibitor. She
will take lovenox until her INR is at goal ([**1-24**]). She will need
anticoaguation for a total of [**5-31**] months given the suspected
left ventricular thrombus.
Outpatient follow was arranged within one week of discharge with
her cardilogist, and a copy of her discharge summary was faxed
to his office.
.
# Systolic congestive heart failure:
Patient's LVEF was found to be 30%, with apical akinesis.  She
was diuresed as noted in the HPI above and arrived in the CCU
intubated for respiratory failure.  Diuresis was continued and
she was extubated.  She was slowly started on Beta-Blocker and
ACEI, and these were titrated upward. She will likely need
further uptitration of her beta-blocker and ace-inhibitor as
tolerated by her blood pressure, hear
