Left scapule xray
IMPRESSION:
1. Subcutaneous emphysema.
2. Comminuted scapular fracture which may extend to the inferior
glenoid.
3. Multiple mildly displaced rib fractures.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Acute Care service. Orthopedics was
consulted for the scapula fracture which was managed non
operatively. It is being recommended that he wear a sling for
comfort and when out of bed.

He required supplemental oxygen for his low saturations related
to his rib fractures. His IS volumes were low and his sats did
not improve significantly. He was also noted with thick green
sputum production and an elevated WBC of 15. Given his exam and
these findings he was started on Levaquin for 7 days. A chest
xray was obtained in the morning of HD # 4 showing a moderate
sized left hemopneumothorax. A left chest tube was placed with
~275 cc's bloody output. The output decreased significantly and
he was placed to water seal on the next morning. A CXR was done
which did not show any pneumothorax. The chest tube was removed
on [**7-11**]  post pull chest xray showed a residual small
pneumothorax. Clinically he showed improvement, his O2 sats were
in the high 90's and he was without any complaints of dyspnea.
Also of note his cough had improved and there was no further
sputum production.

He did experience significant pain control issues during his
stay. Several adjustments to his pain medication regimen were
made.  Ultram and Toradol were added to the narcotic pain
medication. At time of discharge his pain was well controlled.

He was seen and evaluated by Physical therapy and will require
outpatient Physical therapy once discharged.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a motorcycle crash where
you sustained a left scapula (shoulder) fracture and rib
fractures. These injuries did not require any operations. It is
being recommended that you wear a sling when out of bed and to
limit weight bearing on the left arm/shoulder. It is OK to do
range of motion exercises as instructed by the therapist. You
will also need to go to outpatient Physical therapy for ongoing
treatment.

You were also treated for a suspected pneumonia related to your
rib fractures.

A finding on your chest xray on the 4th hopsital day showed a
collection of blood inth long which required that a chest tube
be placed to drain the blood. Xrays were followed closely and
the tube was eventually removed.

*  Your accident caused rib fractures which can cause severe
pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because
of the pain.

*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay
ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep
breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the
dose and notify your physician.

*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that
pool in the lungs.

*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to
hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing
and deep breathing.

*  Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short
periods may ease the pain.

*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid
and fiber intake if possible.

*  Do NOT smoke

*  If your doctor allows, non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin,
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side
effects so make sure your doctor approves.

*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation
around your ribs ( crepitus ).
