CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

IMPRESSION:
1. Grade 3 splenic injury, with large perisplenic hematoma, with
possible areas of vascular disruption in the splenic hilum, and
foci of active contrast extravasation. Small amount of blood
also extends around the liver.

2. Perisplenic hematoma approaches and slightly displaces the
left hemidiaphragm, and sagittal images suggest possible
discontinuity in the left hemidiaphragm. Diaphragmatic injury
and/or rupture cannot be excluded.

3. Multiple bilateral rib fractures, multifocal areas of
pulmonary contusion, and blood in the pleural spaces
bilaterally.

4. Markedly comminuted right acetabular fracture, and
posteriorly displaced right femoral head.

5. Possible fracture of the posterior aspect of the T4 vertebral
body. When the patient is clinically stabilized, MRI or
thin-slice CT is recommended for further evaluation.

Above findings were discussed with the surgical team at the time
of study interpretation on [**2164-5-8**], and wet [**Location (un) 1131**] was
placed in the ED dashboard conveying the above findings at 1400
hours on [**2164-5-8**].

CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST

IMPRESSION:
1. Acute small avulsion fracture of anterior-inferior endplate
of T4 as well as bilateral fractures of the T5 pedicles at their
junction with the vertebral body.

2. In conjunction with a recent MRI examination, there is
involvement of all three spinal columns making this an unstable
injury and neurosurgical/ orthopedic spine consult is
recommended as discussed with caring trauma team physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 33863**] on date of exam at approximately 3 p.m.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1352**], orthopedic attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the
case with us by telephone at 4PM.

3. Unchanged appearance to bilateral multiple rib fractures and
bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent compression
atelectasis.

ADDENDUM : There is apparent overdistention of endotracheal tube
balloon cuff on scout image. Discussed this observation with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at approximately 6:49 p.m. on date of exam.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2164-5-19**].

There is unchanged cardiomegaly. Spinal fixation hardware is
identified and unchanged. There is a left retrocardiac opacity
with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. This may be
secondary to pleural fluid, atelectasis, or developing
infiltrate. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema. The
right lung is clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service. Orthopedics, and
Orthopedic Spine Surgery were immediately consulted because of
his injuries. He was taken to the operating room for an
exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy. Orthopedics also
performed a closed reduction, right hip dislocation with
traction pin placement and splinting and closed reduction of
right distal tibia fracture at that time. He would later be
taken back to the operating room by Orthopedics for Open
reduction internal fixation right posterior column and
transverse acetabular fracture.

On [**5-12**] he was taken back to the operating room by Orthopedic
Spine Surgery for
treatment of fracture/dislocation of T3-4 and T4-5 posterior
decompression with laminectomy, medial facetectomy at T2-3,
T3-4, T4-5, posterior arthrodesis, T2 to T6, instrumented
segmental posterior T2 to T6 with rod screw hook construct, left
iliac crest bone graft and application of morcellized allograft.

Plastic Surgery was also consulted because of facial fractures
noted on CT imaging; these injuries were deemed nonoperative. No
further interventions regarding this was recommended.

He remained in the Trauma ICU, vented and sedated. A decision
was made on [**5-19**] to perform an open tracheostomy and open
gastrostomy tube placement. He was eventually weaned from
ventilator and sedation and was transferred to the floor in the
next few days. A right femoral percutaneous Bard G2 type
inferior vena cava filter was also placed because of risk for
DVT and PE given his multiple orthopedic injuries.

Once awake Psychiatry was consulted given history of depression
and concerns for if this auto crash was an attempt to harm
himself. He was placed on 1:1 sitters and it was recommended
that he go to an inpatient psychiatric facility once medically
cleared. Both patient and his wife were in agreement to this.

His tracheostomy was removed on [**5-30**] and he is managing his
secretions and maintaining adequate oxygen saturations.

Physical, Occupational and Speech therapy were all consulted. He
made significant gains with the therapies. He is to remain non
weight bearing on his right leg; he passed the swallowing
evaluation. He is no longer receiving tube feedings and is
tolerating a regular diet.
