HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 58-year-old female with a past
medical history of severe coronary artery disease complicated
by myocardial infarction, status post stenting, coronary
artery bypass graft times two, atrial fibrillation/atrial
flutter, status post ablation and cardioversion, pacemaker
placement, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of less than 20%, hypertension, type 2 diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, and mitral valve replacement, who
presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital status post a fall secondary
to instability.  The patient was found to be hypotensive with
a systolic blood pressure in the 70s to 80s.  This was
complicated by acute renal failure and an elevated digoxin
level.  In addition, the patient also had a low hematocrit in
the setting of an elevated INR.

The patient had a similar episode on her last admission to
[**Hospital1 69**] on [**2126-6-5**];
admitted with hypotension and an elevated INR for which she
received dopamine and fresh frozen plasma/vitamin K with good
result.  She has had increasing edema and ascites since this
last admission that has been resistant to outpatient diuretic
treatment.  The patient has gained about 30 pounds since last
admission. For the two months prior to admission, the patient
has been experiencing worsening leg weakness.

On the a.m. of admission the patient began experiencing
lightheadedness.  On the afternoon of admission the patient
was walking in her house and began losing her balance
secondary to leg weakness, per patient.  She fell without
loss of consciousness.  She denied headache, fever, chills,
sweats, dizziness, "blacking out," change in vision or chest
pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, palpitations,
incontinence, and diaphoresis at the time of the fall.  The
fall was complicated by a 1-inch laceration on the back of
her head. She was able to crawl to a cell phone and call a
girlfriend who called an ambulance.

The patient arrive via ambulance to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital where
she received 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma, 1 liter of normal
saline, and dopamine at 8 mcg per minute, as well as suturing
of the laceration prior to her transfer to [**Hospital1 346**].


At [**Hospital1 69**], the patient still
denied headache, fevers, chills, sweats, dizziness, change in
vision, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting,
palpitations, and diaphoresis.  At baseline, the patient
denies chest pain or palpitations.  She does complain of
three-pillow orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and
lower extremity edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  The patient had a myocardial infarction in [**2120**]
resulting in a left bundle-branch block, also complicated by
ventricular tachycardia requiring lidocaine, and atrial
fibrillation requiring cardioversion.
 2.  The patient is status post catheterization, post
myocardial infarction in [**2120**].  Her proximal left circumflex
and distal right coronary artery were stented.
 3.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2120**].  Left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery,
saphenous vein graft to first obtuse marginal, saphenous vein
graft to posterior descending artery, as well as a mitral
valve ring placed.
 4.  The patient is status post catheterization in [**2123**].
Catheterization showed occlusion of left internal mammary
artery and both saphenous vein grafts, severe systolic and
diastolic dysfunction bilaterally, moderate pulmonary
hypertension, and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation.
 5.  The patient had a coronary artery bypass graft redo
in [**2123**]; saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending
artery, saphenous vein graft to first diagonal to first
obtuse marginal, as well as mechanical mitral valve
replacement.
 6.  Pacemaker placement in [**2123**]; pacemaker is a DDD-type
with dual chamber leads.
 7.  The patient has a history of atrial flutter, status post
ablation and cardioversion in [**2124-11-18**]; and a history
of atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion in [**2125-4-19**].
 8.  The patient had a MIBI stress test done in [**2125-11-19**] which showed severe fixed inferolateral wall
defects.
 9.  The patient had an echocardiogram done in [**2125-1-17**]
which showed dilated left ventricle, global hypokinesis,
right ventricular akinesis, significant mitral regurgitation
and tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, and
an ejection fraction of less than 20%.
10.  Hypertension.
11.  Congestive heart failure.
12.  Type 2 diabetes controlled with diet, not requiring
insulin.
13.  Hypercholesterolemia.
14.  Peripheral vascular disease with claudication.  The
patient requires heart catheterization via brachial artery
due to severe peripheral vascular disease.
15.  Depression.
16.  Dysfunctional uterine bleeding with thickening
endometrium on ultrasound.  This was found in [**2125-11-19**].
17.  Obesity.
18.  Anal fissure.
19.  Questionable history of a gastrointestinal bleed that
has not been worked up.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history is negative for coronary
artery disease.
