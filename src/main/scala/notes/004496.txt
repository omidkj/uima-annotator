Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
CXR [**2133-6-10**]: Cardiomegaly is severe, associated with severe
bilateral pulmonary edema, unchanged since the prior chest
radiograph from [**2133-6-9**], but progressed since [**2133-6-3**]. Bibasilar consolidations may represent a combination of
pulmonary edema and aspiration.

ECHO [**2133-6-9**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with inferior akinesis/hypokinesis,
and inferolateral and inferoseptal hypopkinesis . [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, laterally directed
jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-1-9**],
regional wall motion abnormalities may have been present
previously (views subopitmal) but overall left ventricular
ejection fraction now appears slightly less vigorous. Mitral
regurgitation is now much more prominent and estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is now higher.

SWALLOW STUDY [**2133-6-5**]:  Premature spillover with laryngeal
penetration, but no frank aspiration. Pooling within the
vallecula and piriform sinuses is noted. Please see speech
pathologist report for further details.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is the hospital course for a 81 year old man with systolic
and diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 45%), hypertension,
atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with vascular dementia, and
recent pneumonia here with what was thought to be a CHF
exacerbation, but was an aspiration pneumonia. Patient
contracted C. difficile colitis while in the hospital, and
developed acute renal failure and hypernatremia.

On HD7 he was transferred to the Medical ICU for hypoxic
respiratory distress, which appeared to be primarily due to
flash pulmonary edema given the acuity of onset. This was
treated with IV furosemide and the patient was placed on BiPAP.
He was started on a furosemide drip and continued to improve. He
was able to be weaned from his oxygen requirement, discontinued
from his drip diuresis, and then transferred to the cardiology
floor.

The C. Difficile colitis was treated with a vancomycin 14 day
course.

The hypernatremia increased across the admission max was 152.
Dehydration was the likely cause and he was given D5 1/2 NS for
correction along with continued diuresis. Giving the patient's
dementia, his thirst drive is suppressed, and this will likely
be a repeat event for him. His family was concerned about giving
him more fluid and causing him to go into further heart failure.


Acute kidney injury resolved with time over admission.
Congestive heart failure was stable along with the atrial
fibrillation for which he is anticoagulated.

Per urology, the patient is to have Foley catheter for 3 weeks
due to a large hydrocele. He should follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] within 2 weeks for reassessment of his Foley.

Video swallow study performed on [**2133-6-5**], confirmed worsening of
patient's ability to tolerate nectar-thickened diet, progressed
to honey-thickened with aspiration precautions. We were unable
to assess his mental status upon arrival to the floor due to his
somnolence and baseline dementia. He remained oriented to name
only.

He was discharged back to his rehab facility home (Renaissance)
where his wife also lives. He was made DNR/DNI on this
admission.

Transitional- Mr. [**Known lastname 71190**] will be transferred back to a skilled
nursing facility. He should remain on PO Vancomycin until
[**2133-6-20**] to complete his 14 day course for C.Diff colitis.  Also
he should make a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
evaluation of his hydrocele and continued Foley catheter.
