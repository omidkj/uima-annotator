HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an unfortunate 70
year old woman that underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
times two by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2134-11-15**].  She did
remarkably well and was eventually discharged home about one
week later postoperatively.  Once at home, she developed
diarrhea and abdominal pain.  For this problem, she presented
to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital where she was initially treated for a
question of Clostridium difficile infection.  Unfortunately,
she became progressively ill and continued to deteriorate.
Subsequently she was found to have a pulmonary embolism and
she was initially treated with intravenous Heparin.  The
patient became thrombocytopenic and she was diagnosed with
HIT clinically but no antibodies were checked.  Subsequently,
she was anticoagulated with Hirudin but unfortunately
developed a massive upper gastrointestinal bleed with
significant hemodynamic instability.  She was intubated and
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital3 1280**]
Hospital where over the course of the next week developed
worsening renal failure as well as liver failure with a
creatinine of 3.0, almost no urine output, and liver function
tests in the 7,000s.  She was also coagulopathic with an INR
of 8.0.  She remained significantly acidotic with a lactate
of 20. The medical team had made arrangements to transfer
this patient to the [**Hospital1 69**] but
her hemodynamic instability precluded this from happening.
Finally on [**2134-12-2**], she was stable enough transiently and
off her Levophed and vasopressin that she was transferred to
the [**Hospital1 69**] for further
management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon arriving to the Intensive Care Unit at
the [**Hospital1 69**], she was back on the
Levophed and vasopressin and her systolic blood pressure
measured by cuff was in the 80s.  An A line, Swan catheter
and a dialysis catheter were immediately placed in a joint
effort with the Intensive Care Unit team and the surgical
team that was admitting the patient.  Her initial gas upon
arrival was severely acidotic with a pH of 7.04, pCO2 52, pO2
110, bicarbonate 50 and base excess of minus 17 and a lactate
of 24.  She was bolused and resuscitated with two liters of
intravenous crystalloid and fresh frozen plasma was ordered.
A duplex ultrasound was obtained and demonstrated flow from
both hepatic arteries and veins as well as a patent portal
vein as it was a major concern that she might have thrombosed
either her hepatic arteries or veins.  Kidneys were also
within normal limits in this limited ultrasound study.  An
electrocardiogram demonstrated partial intermittent blocks
and cardiology was consulted for a potential pacing wire.
This was decided since the patient was placed on Dopamine and
her heart rate was still in the 50s.  Renal was also
consulted in an effort to correct her acidosis and
potentially remove some volume as she had an initial wedge of
26 with pulmonary artery pressures of 50/25 and cardiac
output of 3.0 and an index of 1.7.  These numbers were the
opening pressures when the Swan catheter was placed.  Despite
the pressors and Dopamine, her pressure remained low.  Her
initial hematocrit was 27.0 but subsequently dropped to 24.0
and later to 21.0.  She was transfused two units of packed
red blood cells and six units of fresh frozen plasma in an
effort to correct her coagulopathy and to further resuscitate
her with partial and transient improvement of her
hemodynamics.  A new arterial blood gas was obtained
revealing persistent acidosis and a new hematocrit of 12.0.
Given her recent coronary artery bypass graft, liver failure,
renal failure, as well as her severe coagulopathy and
acidosis, the family was informed of the severity of this
patient's condition and they requested to make her comfort
measures only.  Postmortem was offered to the family and they
agreed for that.  Shortly after pressor support was
withdrawn, the patient expired and was pronounced dead at
6:32 p.m. on [**2134-12-2**].  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the
family were informed of the event and the medical examiner
waived the case.
