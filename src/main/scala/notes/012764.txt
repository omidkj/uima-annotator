CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2162-1-27**] 9:30 PM
Retrocardiac opacity which may represent an infiltrate.
Bilateral pleural effusions, with associated compressive
atelectasis similar to [**2161-11-11**].

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2162-2-1**] 5:03 AM
A tracheostomy tube and right PICC line remain in place. There
is stable cardiomegaly. Moderate left pleural effusion and
adjacent left retrocardiac opacity have progressed in the
interval. There is probably a small right pleural effusion with
adjacent right basilar atelectasis as well.


Brief Hospital Course:
73 y/o female with h/o COPD,asthma, OSA s/p trach, CHF admitted
from rehab for  revision of tracheostomy.

1. Respiratory: Vocal cords were presumed to be intact because
patient was able to speak [**1-14**] word sentences with the trach cuff
deflated and mechanically blocked.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**1-28**] which showed supraglottic
edema and tracheomalacia.  A T-tube with balloon was initially
recommended, however it was later decided that it was not
indicated.  Instead, the tracheostomy tube was changed to a #6
cuffed, nonfenestrated poretex tracheostomy tube on [**2-2**] by
Interventional Pulmonary.  An upper airway scope was performed
by ENT ([**1-30**]) which showed no further evidence of supraglottic
edema.  Patient was unable to tolerate cuff deflation for a
Passy muir valve evaluation due to O2 desaturation to the 70s.
No further attempt was made to evaluate the PMV.  Sputum
cultures ([**1-30**]) grew out 2+ gram negative rods.  Patient was
initially treated with vancomycin with a plan to monitor
clinical status.  However, it was thought that sputum culture
was more likely representing colonization due to minimal
leukocytosis and lack of clinical evidence of infection (fever,
increased sputum production).  Bilateral pleural effusions were
noted on CXR during this admission.  The first CXR was reported
to be similar to [**2161-11-11**].  However, a follow-up CXR showed
increasing Left pleural effusion.  Patient did not develop any
respiratory problems despite this finding and was treated with
diuresis with Lasix.  Respiratory status was otherwise stable
and outpatient regimen of albuterol/atrovent nebs were continued
here.  Cough medication was given prn.

2. CHF: Patient appeared to be euvolemic.  Outpatient regimen of
bumetanide was continued.

3. Afib: Patient was well rate-controlled during this
hospitalization.  Beta-blocker and digoxin was continued.
Coumadin was initially held for a potential procedure.
However, coumadin was restarted after the trach tube was
replaced.

4. Anemia:  Hemocrits were stable.  Iron supplements.

5. C. diff: Treated with vancomycin 250 po q6h.  This should be
continued until [**2-9**].
