Chief Complaint:
knee pain, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Incision and drainage of left septic knee on [**2166-11-26**].

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo female with a history of CAD and CHF with
EF of 20%, CKD who presents wtih left knee pain.
.
Patient was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 40856**] with MSSA sepsis with
unknown source. TEE was negative for vegetations, but since she
has a pacemaker she was treated with 6 weeks of oxacillin. She
was discharged to [**Hospital 599**] rehab but readmitted [**10-20**] with fevers.
Blood cultures were negative. PICC line was changed and did not
grow any bacteria. TEE showed fibrinous material on the pacer
lead, but this was not felt to be the cause of the fevers. CT
showed pleural effusion but this was thought to be due to CHF
and not infection. There was some thought that the fevers were
due to beta lactam allergy. The patient was treated with
vancomycin for two weeks.
.
Patient reports that four days prior to admission she began to
participate in physical therapy and two days prior to admission
she began to note left knee pain. This has been progressing over
the past day. On the day of admission she developed a
temperature of 99.2 and shaking chills. ESR was 79 and a
portable X ray showed mild arthritis. She was sent to the ED for
evaluation.
.
In the ED she was afebrile. Knee was visibly swollen,
erythematous and warm. Arthrocentesis was performed which
yielded 10 cc of yellow fluid. LDH 1167, glucose 63, wbc [**Numeric Identifier 40857**]

.
She received tylenol, vancomycin one gram, ceftriaxone one gram
and 3 [**Location **].
.
Upon admission to the floor patient was without any localizing
symptoms.

CXR
.
UPRIGHT AP CHEST: A pacemaker ICD device overlies the left
chest, with leads overlying the right atrium and right
ventricle. The patient is post-median sternotomy. There is
unchanged cardiomegaly. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
normal. Since the prior exam, there is no significant change in
the amount of interstitial pulmonary edema. The right pleural
effusion may be slightly enlarged. There is a small left
effusion, unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged degree of congestive failure.
.
KNEE XRAY
.
LEFT KNEE, TWO VIEWS: There is normal mineralization of the
depicted osseous structures. Osteophytes are seen along the
medial tibial plateau as well as the superior aspect of the
patella. There are no definite cortical erosions. Surgical clips
are seen in the medial aspects of the calf.

IMPRESSION: No definite evidence for osteomyelitis. Please note
that bone scan or MRI is more sensitive for this diagnosis.

.
TTE
.
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly
dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe
global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is
severely depressed.
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation
is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old woman with history of CAD and CHF, recent MSSA
sepsis s/p 6 weeks IV antibiotics presents with septic
arthritis, anemia, thrombocytopenia.  She was treated with IV
vancomycin, had I&D of left knee and washout.  During the MICU
course, patient was grossly volume overloaded to her
resuscitation for sepsis.  Volume management ws attempted with
natrecor drip and other means of diuresis as it was primarily
due to CHF.  No HD was offered as patient as there was no
clinical indication.  Patient was DNR/DNI and she was not
intubated.  As her respiratory status worsened, family meeting
was held and it was decided to make the patient CMO.  She
expired on [**2166-12-17**].
.
RESPIRATORY:
Distress: Most likely due to fluid overload for CHF EF 15-20%
with 2+MR, she had minimal diuresis on floor and was given IVF
for her worsening renal failure. Patient on CXR also had
evidence of conolidation/atelctasis on RLL and possible RUL
septic emboli which could be source of resp symptoms. Pacer rate
adjusted by EP and increased to 70. Patient intially improved
with afterload reduction with hydralazine along with improved
diuresis. Patient continued to be in worsening respiratory
dispress requiring prn BiPap despite natrecor drip started with
cardiology consulting service. On [**12-14**] after family meeting it
was agreed to move towards DNR/DNI care.  Patient was
subsequently made CMO and expired on [**2166-12-17**].
