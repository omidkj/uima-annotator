Chief Complaint:
Fever, nausea/vomiting, metal status change

Transesophageal echocardiogram

History of Present Illness:
79 year old female with involved cardiac history (status post 4
vessel CABG with EF <25%) who was admitted to the intensive care
unit for change of mental status and sepsis.  She was otherwise
well until she had an acute episode of increased mental status
changes accompanied by fever, chills, nausea, and non-bloddy,
nonbilious vomiting.  She had no cough, chest pain or pressure,
abdominal pain, shortness of breath.  Initially in the emergency
department, she was febril but normotensive.  She was started on
levofloxacin and metronidazole for questionable pneumonia on
chest x-ray.  Later in the ED, she dropped her pressure to 80s
systolic.  She received 3 L of IV fluid ressuscitation.  A
femoral line was placed and she was started on norepinepherine
and an insulin drip.  Within 10 hours, blood cultures in the ED
grew out 4/4 bottles of gram positive cocci and she was started
on vancomycin.  Of note, the patient had had a rencent dental
procedure.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year-old female with severe coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure, type I diabetes, who was admitted for
bacteremia and sepsis.
.
1. Sepsis: On admission, she was febrile and hypotensive.  She
had been started on pressors in the emergency room; however, the
pressors were stopped on arrival to the intensive care unit.
Her blood pressure was supported with IV fluid boluses.  Within
10 hours, her blood cultures grew out 4/4 bottles on gram
positive cocci that were later found to be staph aureus that
were sensitive to gentamicin and oxacillin.  She had been
initially treated empirically with vancomycin, but was switched
to gentamicin and oxacillin once the sensitivities were back.
The source of her bacteremia was unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 227**] her history of
abdominal abscess, she had an abdmonial CT that was negative.
She had both a transthoracic and a transesophageal
echocardiogram that were negative for vegetations or involvement
of the AICD wires.  However, given that she had high grade
bacteremia with unknown source and has foreign body AICD wires
implanted, she was treated for presumed endocarditis despite
negative echocardiogram studies. ID and EP have been following
the pt. The consensus among the teams is that the pt is to
finish a six week course of oxacillin. She is to have a
follow-up appointment 2 weeks with then device clinic two  weeks
after finishing her course of oxacillin. At that time it will be
dtermined whether the pt is to have her pacer removed.

2. Congestive heart failure: She has poor systolic function with
an ejection fraction of 20-25%.  During her initial volume
ressucitation, she received 5 L of IV fluids.   On hospital day
2, she became acutely short of breath with an oxygen saturation
in the low 80s and required a non-rebreater mask to maintain
oxygenation.  A chest x-ray was showed severe pulmonary edema
and a large right-sided pleural effusion.  An electrocardiogram
was unchanged from prior.  Her oxygenation improved with
furosemide. We have continued to diurese her with standing po
lasix and iv lasix prn. Her exam has continued to improve from
her period of desaturation.
.
3. Atrial fibrillation: On hospital day 3, she had several
episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
During one episode, the atrial fibrillation triggered
ventricular taycardia.  Her AICD fired on three occasions.  She
was loaded with IV amiodarone and then transitioned to a 7 day
course of an oral amiodarone load.  Her AICD was interegated and
reprogrammed not better distinguish between supraventricular
tachycardias and ventricular tachycardias.   On hospital day  4,
she had two additional episodes of atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular rate  that were broken with IV metoprolol.
She remained hemodynamically stable during those events.  She
had new Q-waves in I and AVL that reversed once she was no
longer in atrial fibrillation.
.
4. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Her baseline creatinine
is between 1.4-1.6.  On admission, she had an elevated
creatinine above her baseline that was attributed to
hypoperfusion.  Her creatinine improved toward her basline with
fluid resuscitation.  On hospital day 4, she had worsening of
her renal failure in the setting of hypotension with IV
amiodarone load for which she was started on phenylepherine.  As
evidenced by an acute rise in her lactate, she was thought to be
hypoperfusing her organs in the setting of being intravascularly
volume depleted and on phenylepherine.  She was quickly weaned
off of the pressor and volume ressuscitated with IV fluids.
After this episode, she remained oliguric for 36 hours, which
was attributed to ATN.  Her creatinine peaked at 3.6 from 2.0.
She began autodiuresing and her creatinine trended down.  Her
creatinine has stabilized at around 1.8. Her medications doses
were all renally dosed and adjusted for the changed in her renal
function.
.
5. Metabolic acidosis: On admission, she had a metabolic gap
acidosis that was attricuted to lactic acidosis.  This improved
with IV fluid ressuscitation.  With the episode of acute
oliguric renal failure, she again had a metabolic gap acidosis
that was attributed to both an uremic and lactic acidosis.  This
acidosis improved with resolution
