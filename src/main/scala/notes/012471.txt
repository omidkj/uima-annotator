Chief Complaint:
Hypercarbia and altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 82 year-old female with a history of COPD,
dermatomyositis, diastolic CHF, HTN, who presents with altered
MS, dyspnea, increased somnolence at her nursing home. The staff
noticed her to be somnulant, confused and short of breath with a
non productive cough; vital signs then revealed an oxygen
saturation in the 86% on room air--> 92% on 2L. She was afebrile
with otherwise stable vitals. She was started on a NRB with
improvement in her sats to 100%.
.
In the ED, her vitals were 97.8, 92, 136/60, 98% 4L. FS 181. She
initially was 98%4L and once O2 was decreased, her mental status
slightly improved. An ABG was done which showed a PCO2 of 84.
She was started on bipap in the ED without a repeat ABG. She
then became more somnolent again, and her FiO2 was decreased in
an attempt to improve her respiratory drive. She was treated
with levofloxacin and aztreonam. CXR was unchanged from prior.
She also had a positive UA. Blood and urine cultures were sent.
Most recent vitals were 71, 102/88, 18, 99% on BIPAP.
.
Patient was then transferred to the ICU on BiPAP for further
management of her respiratory status.
.
ROS: Unable to obtain on arrival to ICU. The patient denies any
current pain.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2111-12-21**]  4:44:30 PM
Sinus rhythm and sinus arrhythmia, occasional atrial ectopy.
Left atrial
enlargement. Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular
block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2111-12-6**] there is variation
in precordial
lead placement. Frequent atrial ectopy. Otherwise, no diagnostic
interim
change.

CXR [**12-21**]
CONCLUSION: Cardiomegaly with bibasal effusions and possible
consolidation at
both lung bases. Overall, the appearances are largely unchanged
since the
examination of [**2111-12-5**].

CXR [**12-28**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph of [**2111-12-25**], 4:46
a.m., the bilateral elevation of the hemidiaphragms is
emphasized by air and
stool-filled colon loops. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities
are masked
by moderate amounts of pleural effusion. The overall extent of
these
opacities however appears unchanged. The size of the cardiac
silhouette
cannot be exactly determined.

Abd X-ray [**12-23**]
IMPRESSION: No free air. Probable bibasilar atelectasis.

Abd X-ray [**12-27**]
IMPRESSION:
Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern. Remote trauma involving the
left femoral
head and acetabulum.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 82 year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic
CHF, HTN, dermatomyositis, and chronic R hemidiaphragm elevation
who was admitted with altered mental status/somnolence in the
setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure, also with positive
UTI
.
# Respiratory distress: On presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vitals
were 97.8, 92, 136/60, 98% 4L. FS 181. She initially was 98%4L
and once O2 was decreased, her mental status slightly improved.
An ABG was done which showed a PCO2 of 84 prompting BiPap, no
repeat ABG performed. She then became more somnolent again, and
her FiO2 was decreased in an attempt to improve her respiratory
drive. She was treated with levofloxacin and aztreonam. CXR was
unchanged from prior. Patient was then transferred to the ICU on
BiPAP for further management of her respiratory status. In the
ICU the patient was continued on Bipap. The patient was
evaluated by the ID Service with recommendation for repeat UA
and hold on treatment of UTI awaiting proof of persistent
infection. She was continued on Vancomycin/ levofloxacin/
aztreonam for possible PNA. Given the patient's difficulty with
weaning from bipap and infiltrate on exam antibiotics were
continued for pneumonia with planned 8 day course. The patient
was also started on a steroid taper for possible reactive airway
component to respiratory failure. Following the addition of
steroids, the patient improvemed and was able to tolerate wean
of Bipap. She was off Bipap for over 24 hours and transferred
out of the ICU. The patient has voiced her wish for no
intubation. She has intermittent declined lab draws and would
like to focus her care on comfort. Concern for aspiration
prompted S&S eval, as the patient had a cough they were unable
to adequately eval at the bedside. The patient initially refused
video swallow however later agreeed. She was evaluated at
bedside by S&W and recommended regular solids, nectar thick
liquids.  The patient underwent a video swallow on [**12-29**] that did
not show gross aspiration, but did show retention of thin
liquids.  The risk were stated to the patient and she was
continued on nectar thick liquids, but could in the future have
thin liquids as the patient understands the risks.  The patient
finished her 8-day course of vanco/levofloxacin/aztreonam on
[**12-29**]. Her steriods were also titrated back to her home dose of
15mg prednisone daily. The paitent continued to require 1L O2 to
maintain sats >95%. The patient has occasional episodes of
tachypnea that improves with nebs prn.  Her respiratory status
is stable, but has occasional episodes of dyspnea and tachypnea.


# Hypoglycemia: The patient had an episode of hypoglycemia
secondary to poor po i
