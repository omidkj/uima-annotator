Admission Date:  [**2187-11-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2187-11-14**]

Date of Birth:                  Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for atrial
fibrillation of unknown duration and atrial septal defect who
was admitted for a heart block following cardioversion.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation noted by her
primary care physician in [**Name9 (PRE) **] - previous duration is
unknown.  She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] for further
evaluation.  He started the patient on a beta blocker, and
ACE inhibitor, and also anticoagulated her on Coumadin with
plans for cardioversion.

The patient was admitted on [**11-9**] for a transesophageal
echocardiogram and direct current cardioversion.  The patient
successfully underwent to direct current cardioversion;
however, following this, she had a 15-second pause in her
heart beat and a subsequent junction rhythm at 38 beats per
minute to 40 beats per minute.  She was given atropine,
dopamine, and isoproterenol with an increase in her
junctional rhythm to the 60s.  She was continued on an
isoproterenol drip with her heart rate remaining stable in
the 60s; still junctional.  The patient denied any dizziness,
or shortness of breath, or chest pain with this.  She was
transiently hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the
70s immediately following her bradycardia; however, this
quickly resolved.  She was then transferred to the Coronary
Care Unit for further monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation of unknown duration.
2.  Atrial septal defect.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Home medications included)
1.  Coumadin 3.5 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Prilosec.
3.  Remeron
4.  Atenolol 25 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg by mouth once per day.

ALLERGIES:  AMOXICILLIN and SULFA.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco use.  Alcohol use revealed one
glass of wine per month.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient's temperature was 98.8 degrees
Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 120/57, her heart rate was
64, her respiratory rate was 18, and her oxygen saturation
was 93% to 100% on room air.  In general, a pleasant and
well-developed female in no acute distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  The extraocular
movements were intact.  The oropharynx was clear.
Cardiovascular examination revealed bradycardia with a
regular rhythm.  There were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The
abdominal examination revealed positive bowel sounds.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremity
examination revealed no edema or cyanosis.  Neurologic
examination revealed no focal deficits.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 6.9, her
hematocrit was 36.3, and her platelets were 247.  Her
prothrombin time was 19.1, her partial thromboplastin time
was 29.1, and her INR was 2.4.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a
junctional rhythm at a rate of 54 with retrograde P waves.
Left axis.  No ST changes.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Coronary artery disease:
The patient with no known history of coronary artery disease.
She had no chest pain or ischemic symptoms during her
hospitalization.

(b)  Pump:  The patient with impaired systolic function.  A
recent echocardiogram revealed global left ventricular
dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40% to 50%.  On a
beta blocker and ACE inhibitor as an outpatient; however,
these were held following her admission, in the setting of
her dysrhythmia and her pause following direct current
cardioversion.

Following pacemaker placement, she was placed back on a beta
blocker which was titrated up.  This was tolerated well.

(c)  Rhythm:  The patient with a history of atrial
fibrillation of unknown duration who was admitted for a
transesophageal echocardiogram and direct current
cardioversion.  Her transesophageal echocardiogram showed no
thrombi, and she was successfully cardioverted.  However,
following this, she went into sinus asystole with a pause of
approximately 15 seconds and then recovered with a junctional
rhythm in the 40s.  This was thought to be due to severe
sinus node dysfunction given her long-term atrial
fibrillation.

The patient was initially started on isoproterenol and
monitored to see if her sinus function recovered.  She was
observed in the Unit for close monitoring.  The patient's
sinus function did not recover, and she continued to be in a
junctional rhythm.

Following several days without any recovery of function, the
decision was made to place a pacemaker.  The pacemaker was
placed on [**11-12**].  She then underwent repeat direct
current cardioversion.  Following this, the patient was
A-paced with a rate in the 70s.  She was started on sotalol
which was titrated up to a dose of 80 mg by mouth twice per
day.   She was also started on Coumadin and had followup
scheduled in the Device Clinic.

The patient was admitted on Coumadin per her home regimen for
her atrial fibrillation.  Her INR was supratherapeutic on
admission, and her heparin was initially held.  Following her
pacemaker placement, the patient was restarted on Coumadin
with a plan to follow up in the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic for
monitoring of her INR.

2.  GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was
admitted with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease
and was maintained on a proton pump inhibitor per her home
regimen.

3.  PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES:  The patient with a diagnosis of
depression.  The patient was continued on Remeron per her
outpatient regimen.

4.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was
maintained on a cardiac diet which she tolerated well.  Her
electrolytes were followed throughout her hospitalization.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Sotalol 80 mg by mouth twice per day.
2.  Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth q.24h.
3.  Remeron 15 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
4.  Clindamycin 600 mg by mouth q.8h. (times one week).
5.  Coumadin 4 mg by mouth once per day.

The patient was instructed to discontinue aspirin when her
INR is therapeutic at 2.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was instructed to follow up in the Device
Clinic on [**11-20**].
2.  The patient was instructed to follow up as scheduled with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] and her primary care physician.
