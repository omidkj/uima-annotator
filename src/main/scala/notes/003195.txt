History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 4401**] is a [**Age over 90 **]y/o F h/o dCHF, CAD (CABGx2), HTN. She was
found in bed by her husband with a head laceration, amnestic to
event.  Per Husband, they were getting ready for dinner with
family when the pt stated she was going to lie down for a bit.
The husband checked on her 15-30min later and he noticed blood
on her scalp and pillow.  Pt did not recall falling.  EMS was
initiated at that point and pt brought to ED.  Her only
complaint in the ED was back pain, which she attributed to the
stretcher. On imaging, it was found that she had an intracranial
hemorrhage and SAH, for which she was originally admitted to the
neurosurgery service.

Pt denies any numbness, weakness, tingling. Denies HA, nausea,
vomiting.  Denies neck pain. Denies CP, SOB.  There was no bowel
or bladder incontinence, or tongue biting associated with the
event.  She has no hx of seizures.  She has no hx of syncope.

Pt was transferred to the MICU in the setting of respiratory
distress and intubated on [**7-16**]. Pt was extubated on [**7-25**] and
called out to the medicine floor on [**7-28**] (more details in
hospital course).

CT C Spine [**7-14**]
1. no acute fracture or malalignment
2. multilevel DJD
3. right thyroid nodules can be evaluted by non-emergent
ultrasound if
clinically indicated.
.
CT Head [**7-14**]
Small intraparenchymal hemorrhage with SAH extension in the
right frontal and left parieto-occipital lobes. No midline
shift. No fracture.
.
CT Head [**7-15**]
1. Overall expected evolution of right frontal and left
occipital
subcentimeter hemorrhagic contusions with associated
subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Less conspicuous parafalcine and left
tentorial subdural hemorrhage, with redistribution of blood
products into the occipital horns, also compatible with expected
evolution. No new focal hemorrhage.
2. Underlying small vessel ischemic disease and probable left
frontal lacune. Focal hypodensity in the mid brain could also
represent additional lacune.  Once acute issues resolve, MRI
could be con
