Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
40F w/ metastatic breast cancer (liver, lungs, pleural space,
brain) who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**5-20**] with shortness
of breath and increased LE edema. Pateint reports she awoke on
Saturday at 2-3am not feeling herself with increased SOB,
orthopnea, and LE edema, associated with cough and mild chest
pain with coughing but none at rest or with exertion. Cough is
rarely productive of white sputum and she has noted wheezing as
well but no fever or chills. She has significant orthopnea to
the point where she has been sleeping in a recliner. Report
symptoms dissimilar from previous episodes where she has had to
have pericardial effusions drained.
.
At [**Hospital1 **], she was initially hypoxic and required bipap. She
diuresed quite well with lasix and was weaned down to 3L NC. She
was transferred here as her oncologic care is here. She also had
a head CT with brain mets and vasogenic edema (although
improved) as below so decadron dosng was increased to [**Hospital1 **].
Currently, she reports that her breathing and edema are much
improved although not yet back to her baseline. Her chest pain
has improved. ROS is remarkable for right sided facial droop
over the last week and left sided headache. Denies N/V, visual
changes. Has also had hoarse voice x 2 months. Also reports
right arm numbness related to an IV placed several months ago.
ROS otherwise negative in detail.

Past Medical History:
Past Medical Hx:
1. Metastatic breast cancer: Oncology History: Initially
diagnosed in [**1-29**] when she found a breast mass in her left
breast. Biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated tumor,
ER/PR/Her2neu all negative, underwent
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and subsequently bilateral mastectomy
with reconstruction in [**7-29**], and subsequently with radiation
post operatively. She was then diagnosed in [**11-28**] with brain
metastases, and underwent whole brain radiation. MRI completed
in [**1-30**] showed increased size of her brain mets. She was also
diagnosed in [**1-30**] with a malignant pericardial effusion when she
presented with tamponade, and was admitted to the CCU. She was
started on xeloda and avastin, which were stopped when liver
mets were seen on imaging. At that time, she was started on
adriamycin. She again developed a pericardial effusion which was
drained in the cath lab in [**3-30**]. After that, her adriamycin was
switched to navelbine. She also developed a malignant pleural
effusion which was drained.
.

Social History:
Lives with husband, works as a program coordinator for WGBH. H/o
cigarettes one-half to one pack per day x 10 years, quite appx
[**2173**]. ETOH or drugs - none. She also has a son who is now 21.

grandmother who had colon cancer and maternal grandfather who
might have had prostate or colon cancer. The patient has no
siblings.

CARDIOLOGY:
TTE ([**5-24**]):
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a small pericardial
effusion (?loculated). There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. There is significant, accentuated respiratory
variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with
impaired ventricular filling. Pericardial constriction cannot be
excluded.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-4-22**], no
change. If indicated, a cardiac MRI or CT may be better to
assess for pericardial constriction/pericardial thickness.

[**Year (4 digits) 706**]:
CXR [**5-22**]:
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to [**2186-5-17**], and multiple priors.
Lung volumes remain very low, but allowing for this,
cardiomediastinal
contours appear unchanged. Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural
effusions are not significantly changed, right greater than
left. Known pleural and
parenchymal metastases are not well visualized by radiographs,
better
demonstrated on recent CT of [**2186-4-19**].
.
CTA Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence pulmonary embolus.
2. New right lower lobe consolidative opacity consistent with
pneumonia.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions (increased on left) and
persistent pericardial effusion.
4. No short interval change in widespread metastatic disease.
.
CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Slightly increased amount of vasogenic edema compared to
prior MR,
however, difficult to assess due to difference in techniques. If
direct
comparison is required, consider repeating MR.
.
CRX [**6-9**]
Mild pulmonary edema has worsened, left lower lobe is
chronically collapsed, no appreciable right pleural effusion,
pigtail pleural drain still in place, small left pleural
effusion stable, heart size is normal. Since the chin is down,
tip of the endotracheal tube less than 15 mm from the carina is
acceptable. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of
view.
