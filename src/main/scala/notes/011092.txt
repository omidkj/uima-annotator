HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
woman who was transferred from [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital after
several hours of posterior and anterior headaches sustaining
the worst headache of her life.  Denied fever, nuchal
rigidity, blurry vision, or vomiting.

CT scan shows diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.  The patient
was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Osteoarthritis.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, the patient was
afebrile, pulse 72, blood pressure 160/72, respiratory rate
14, and sats 100%, intubated.  The patient was sedated and
intubated.  Pupils were 2 mm and minimally reactive.  Chest
was clear to auscultation.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate,
and rhythm, abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic
examination:  Patient was localizing with the bilateral upper
extremities, withdrawing the lower extremities, and pupils
were trace reactive.

The patient was on CPAP with pressure support.  Was admitted
to the Neurologic Intensive Care Unit, where ventricular
drain was placed without complication.  On [**2146-3-21**], the
patient underwent an angiogram which showed patient had a
posterior communicating artery aneurysm for which she was to
receive coiling procedure.

On [**2146-3-23**], the patient was not opening her eyes to
sternal rub, localizing on the right and left.  Moving feet
spontaneously, but was not following commands.  She was scheduled
for arteriogram with possible coiling of the left PCOM aneurysm.

The patient underwent this procedure on [**2146-3-23**] which was
complicated by intraprocedural perforation of the aneurysm with
extravasation of blood into the cisterns which was decompressed
by the existing EVD.  The anticoagulation was immediately
reversed and the coiling was continued until the aneurysm was
sealed. A new EVD was placed on the contralateral side which
returned an ICP in the low teens range. Postprocedure
the patient was intubated and sedated.  Pupils were 4 down to
3 mm.  Corneals were present, no withdrawal of the upper
extremities.  She had no groin hematoma.  She had palpable
dorsalis pedis pulses.  Neurologically, she was difficult to
assess secondary to sedation, but she remained intubated and
sedated.

On [**2146-3-24**], the patient opens her eyes minimally to
vigorous stimulation.  Pupils right was larger than the left.
She did not attend to visual stimulation.  She would not
follow commands.  She was localizing to pain.  She remained
intubated and sedated.

Postprocedure course was complicated by fevers and pneumonia,
and despite the best efforts, her neurologic examination
failed to improve although a CT showed no hemispheric or
territorial infarcts.  The family decided to make the patient
comfort measures only, and the patient passed away on [**2146-4-2**].
