Allergies:
Penicillins / Tetracyclines / Iodine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
left leg deep venous thrombosis and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
CC: shortness of breath and DVT in left lower extremity
HPI: 70 y/o CM with h/o AML dx [**12-8**] s/p allo-BMT [**5-9**] c/b GVHD
of the lungs (bronchiolitis obliterans) and the lichen-planus
version of GVHD of the skin, transferred from OSH with left LE
DVT extending up to groin.  He went to [**Hospital3 **] ER
with shortness of breath, tachycardia, and lower extremity
edema.  He was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response at the OSH and ruled in by cardiac enzymes for non-ST
elevation MI.  He was in pulmonary edema and diuresed with
lasix.  His metoprolol was titrated up, but not on aspirin upon
transfer.  He was started on Lovenox for anti-coagulation and 2
doses of coumadin were given to bridge prior to tranfer.  V/Q
scan low probability for PE, as IV Contrast could not be used
(allergy to contrast).
     He has been constipated in the past few weeks and
attributes this to oxycodone use (for history of spinal
compression fracture).  In the past 3 days, however, he has had
several small, loose stools/day.  No abdominal pain.

ROS: No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.  Skin unchanged.


Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
Pt was diagnosed with AML MO subtype in [**2192-12-5**] after 2
months of progressively worsening fatigue and dyspnea on
exertion. He was treated with idarubicin and ARA-C (7+3).
Induction was complicated by typhlitis. In [**2-9**] he received
HiDAC consolidation, which was well tolerated. Marrow
examination [**4-9**] showed no evidence of leukemia. He was
subsequently admitted on [**2193-6-4**] for busulfan/cytoxan followed
by allogeneic sibling matched transplant.
.
His post transplant course was complicated by GVHD of the lungs
and skin.  The pt developed BOOP, bronchiolitis obliterans, for
which he is on chronic steroid therapy, inhalers.  His last set
of PFTs was FEV1 1.58, FVC 2.47, on [**2194-1-31**].  He also developed
GVHD of the skin, lichen planus subtype, for which he has
received 2 doses of rituxan with benefit.

[**2194-6-23**] CXR: Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2194-6-11**]. The heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous with no
focal dilatation. The lungs are clear. The pleural surfaces are
smooth. There is no pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process

EKG: unchanged from prior.  HR 60's.  Sinus rhythm, left bundle
branch block, left axis deviation.

[**2194-6-24**] CT Chest without contrast
CT OF THE CHEST:
IMPRESSION:
1. New multifocal peribronchiolar and peripheral ground-glass
opacities. The appearance suggests infectious process, most
likely due to RSV in the setting of bone marrow transplant,
although infectious etiologies and COP are also possible.
2. Minimal diffuse bronchial dilation, a finding that may be
seen with
obliterative bronchiolitis. Expiratory images were not performed
to
demonstrate potential air trapping.
3. T7 and T9 compression fractures, new since the prior CT but
unchanged from [**6-11**] chest x-ray.
.
[**2194-7-8**] Portable CXR
Vascular catheter remains in standard position. Heart size is
normal. There are three subtle poorly defined rounded areas of
opacity present in the right upper lobe, right infrahilar region
and left retrocardiac region. This could be due to an early
bronchopneumonia, septic emboli, or multifocal aspiration.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 70 year old male with AML s/p Allo BMT complicated by GVHD
of lungs and skin transferred from an outside hospital with DVT,
NSTEMI in the setting of Afib with RVR, and worsening shortness
of breath. Mr. [**Known lastname 1007**] had a very long and complicated course that
ended in his death over a month after his admission.

Briefly Mr. [**Known lastname 1007**] was admitted on his home regimen of
medications and was started on lovenox to treat his DVT.  His VQ
scan did not show evidence of pulmonary embolus.  He had severe
dyspnea on admission which was likely multifactorial, for the
most part being secondary to his bronchiolitis obliterans/GVHD
of the lungs with an element of congestive heart failure
secondary to his NSTEMI.  He was diuresed and his heart failure
was treated.  With regards to his [**Last Name **] problem: lung GVHD, Ms.
[**Known lastname 1007**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] decided to procede with a new therapy
called photopheresis which had been discussed on an outpatient
basis.  His lovenox was held fo a day prior to placement of his
photopheresis catheter, but unfortunately Mr. [**Known lastname 1007**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
profusely and became further hypoxic in the setting of the
catheter placement.  He was sent to the MICU, placed on CPAP and
diuresed for his hypoxia.  He was kept off anticoagulation and
was transfused numerous units of pRBCs.  He was stabilized and
sent back to the floor.  There continued to be problems
controlling his anticoagulation (although his bleeding subsided)
and was eventually placed on a low-goal, no bolus hepari
