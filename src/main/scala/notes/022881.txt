Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
reaccumulation of pericardial fluid found on follow-up echo

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
balloon pericardiotomy [**2159-12-21**]


History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old female with a PMH notable for CML in
remission for 15 years on hydroxyurea with recent relapse, s/p
recent admission from [**Date range (1) 105483**]/11 with complicated medical
course necessitating ICU care following fall, pericardial
effusion, acute stress induced cardiomyopathy and volume
overload, who underwent pericardiocentesis on [**2159-10-22**] and
represented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2159-12-20**] with recurrent pericardial
effusion.
.
Patient with complicated recent hospital course.  On [**2159-10-22**],
patient presented s/p fall and was admitted to the ICU due to
hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation in the setting
of acute stress induced cardiomyopathy with an EF of 25-30% and
bilateral pleural effusions.  Patient underwent
pericardiocentesis with drainage of 700 cc of straw colored
fluid.  Cytology was negative.  A repeat TTE at the time of
discharge did not demonstrate reaccumulation of her effusion,
which was thought to be secondary to her dasatinib.  Patient was
diuresed and underwent bilateral thoracentesis (700cc and
1500cc).  Hospital course complicated by strep pneumo septicemia
and patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.  Of
note, following her fall, OSH CT was suggestive of SAH/SDH, and
brain MRI demonstrated findings consistent with PRES vs.
evolving infarcts, for which she has been followed by neurology
as an outpatient.
.
Since her discharge, patient has been doing fairly well, and
denies any signficant chest pain, dyspnea, fevers, chills,
palpitations, PND, or orthopnea.  She has been fatigued since
her prior hospitalization and can only travel around the house
without developing significant dyspnea.  Patient was started on
gleevec 6 days prior, and was evaluated by her cardiologist on
[**2158-12-19**] as an outpatient follow up visit and surveillance TTE
demonstrated a moderate pericardial effusion with early signs of
tamponade physiology.  Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for
consideration of a pericardial window.  Today, patient was taken
to the cath lab and underwent ballon pericardiotomy with removal
of 450 cc of serosanguinous fluid.
.
On the floor, patient reports that she is without acute
complaints.  Of note, patient is also s/p bilateral
thoracentesis during her prior hospitalization.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

- ECG: [**2159-12-20**]: 75 bpm, borderline left axis deviation, RBBB, no
evidence of active ischemia
.
- ECHO: [**2159-12-19**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. There is
significant, accentuated respiratory variation in
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows (respiratory variation 25-30%),
consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
IMPRESSION: Moderate pericardial effusion with early signs of
tamponade physiology. Normal biventricular function. No
signifcant valvular disease. Borderline
