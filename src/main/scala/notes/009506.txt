Imaging:
Head CT ([**10-11**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval right frontal craniotomy, with a persistent right
subdural
hematoma, and a moderate degree of pneumocephalus surrounding
the right
frontal lobe which is likely related to recent surgery.
2. Stable small left subdural hematoma.
3. Slightly improved appearance of the right lateral ventricle
compared to
[**2147-10-4**], when it was completely effaced.

Head CT ([**10-12**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged right subdural collection with component of
pneumocephalus and heterogeneous density.
2. Significant, but unchanged, mass effect with compression of
the right
lateral and third ventricles and approximately 9 mm of leftward
midline shift with subfalcine herniation.
3. Unchanged opacification of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells as described above.

Head CT ([**10-13**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in the appearance of right subdural
collection
residual following evacuation of subdural hematoma. There is no
increase in mass effect. There is no new edema, new hemorrhage,
or new infarction.
2. Stable opacification of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells as
described above.

Head CT ([**10-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post evacuation of the right frontoparietal subdural
hematoma with decrease in the shift of midline structures.
2. Decreasing falcing subdural hematoma and stable appearance of
the intra-
intraventricular shunt and opacification of the paranasal
sinuses.
3. New subcentimeter intra-parenchymal hemorrhage of the right
superior
frontal lobe.

Head CT([**10-16**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged appearance of postoperative subdural evacuation
site with recent insertion of drainage catheter.
2. No increase in mild mass effect.
3. Stable small superior right frontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.
4. Persistent opacification of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells.

Head CT([**10-18**]):
IMPRESSION: Little interval change after removal of right
frontal extra-axial drainage catheter. No evidence of new
hemorrhage or mass effect.

Head CT([**10-23**]):
MPRESSION:
1. Slight dilation of the ventricular system since prior study.
2. No evidence for new hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or
infarction.

EEG Monitoring:
([**10-12**]):IMPRESSION: This is a markedly abnormal 24-hour video EEG
telemetry in the waking and sleeping states due to the
occasional runs of up to 30
seconds of right posterior quadrant [**2-26**] Hz rhythmic slowing
without a
clinical correlate suggestive of an electrographic seizure.
Furthermore, there were frequent spike or polyspike and slow
wave discharges seen at a frequency of approximately 1 Hz
primarily over the right hemisphere suggestive of periodic
lateralized epileptiform discharges. This may be seen with a
stroke, hemorrhages, infectious etiologies (e.g. HSV) or after
status epilepticus. Clinical correlation is advised. In
addition, there was a slow and disorganized background rhythm
seen primarily over the left hemisphere suggestive of a mild to
moderate encephalopathy which may be seen with medication
effect, toxic metabolic abnormalities, or infections

EEG([**10-13**]):IMPRESSION: This is a markedly abnormal 24-hour video
EEG telemetry in the waking and sleeping states due to the
frequent sharp and slow wave discharges seen over the right
hemisphere particularly the right
posterior quadrant. In addition, there were frequent runs of up
to 30
seconds of 3 Hz sharp and slow wave discharges seen in the right
posterior quadrant consistent with electrographic seizures. The
right hemisphere, and particularly right posterior quadrant
sharp and slow wave discharges, are suggestive of periodic
lateralized epileptiform discharges which may be seen with
infections, hemorrhages, infarcts, or after status epilepticus.
The slow background rhythm of [**5-30**] Hz is suggestive of a moderate
encephalopathy which may be seen with medication effect, toxic
metabolic abnormalities, or infections.

EEG([**10-14**]):
IMPRESSION: This is a markedly abnormal 24-hour video EEG
telemetry in
the waking and sleeping states due to the numerous
electrographic seizures recorded with focus in the right
posterior quadrant. In addition, there were frequent sharp and
slow wave discharges seen over the right hemisphere but
primarily in the right posterior quadrant with a frequency of
approximately 1 Hz. These periodic lateralized epileptiform
discharges may be seen as a consequence of stroke, hemorrhages,
infections, or after status epilepticus. Finally, the slow
background rhythms seen over the left hemisphere is suggestive
of a moderate encephalopathy which may be seen with medications,
toxic metabolic abnormalities, and infections.

EEG([**10-16**]):
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal 24-hour video EEG telemetry in
the
waking and sleeping states due to the frequent right posterior
quadrant
discharges seen occasionally with a frequency of once every two
seconds.
These periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges may be seen
as a
consequence of infarcts, hemorrhages, or rarely infections. It
may also
be seen after status epilepticus. There were no electrographic
seizures
noted on this recording and there were no pushbutton
activations. In
addition, there was infrequent left temporal mixed frequency
slowing
suggestive of subcortical dysfunction in this region. Finally,
the slow
