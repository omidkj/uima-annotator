Admission Date:  [**2185-5-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-5-31**]

Date of Birth:  [**2117-1-3**]             Sex:   F

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Tetanus / albuterol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea/Throat tightness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Coronary artery bypass graft x3, left internal mammary
    artery to the left anterior descending artery, vein
    graft to the obtuse marginal, and vein graft to the
    right coronary artery.
2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.


History of Present Illness:
68F with strong family history of early CAD, long-standing RA,
pulmonary nodules, and hypertension who presents with worsening
dyspnea on exertion. Over the preceding few weeks, the patient
has noted the gradual onset of worsening DOE with associated
neck tightness. She stated this has actually been an issue for
several years but she has attributed it to deconditioning
related due to limited mobility from spinal stenosis. Despite
the acute worsening, she tried to avoid her symptoms until after
her daughter's wedding this past weekend. She states that
whereas her previous exercise tolerance was approximately one
flight of stairs, she has been getting SOB with minimal exertion
recently. She denies any orthopnea but states that recently she
will awaken during the evening and find that she needs an extra
pillow to allow her to breathe comfortably. She has also noted
some swelling of her ankles. She has not had any chest pain in
the last few days but did have some intermittently over the last
few weeks. She presented to her PCP's office today who was
concerned for new EKG changes and sent her to the ED for further
evaluation. She denies any recent fevers, chills, pleuritic
chest pain, abdominal pain, dysuria, or hematuria.
In the ED, initial VS were 99.7 92 121/63 16 100% RA. EKG was
reportedly notable for NSR at 86 with LVH and new STD in 1 and
AVL with worsening STD in V5 and V6. CXR revealed left lung
opacity obscuring the hemidiaphragm c/f atelectasis but unable
to r/o infection or inflammatory process. CBC and chemistries
were within normal limits. Troponin was 0.12 with CK-MB of 5.
BNP was 812. She was guaiac negative on exam. Her case was
discussed with Atrius Cardiology who recommended initiation of
Heparin gtt for NSTEMI and TTE with consideration of diuresis
after admission. She received ASA 325 mg p/t transfer. She
received Azithromycin and Levofloxacin presumably out of concern
for an infectious process. Blood culture were sent p/t
antibiotics. Vital Signs at transfer: Temp: 97.9 ??????F (36.6 ??????C),
Pulse: 92, RR: 20, BP: 135/60, O2Sat: 97%, O2Flow: (Room Air),
Pain: 0.

Social History:
Retired but used to work for her husband who is a retired
dentist. She smoked previously but stopped 40 years ago. No
alcohol. No illicits. She has one child.

HJR

RESP - unlabored, faint crackles at the bases bilaterally.

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**2185-5-25**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %)
secondary to hypokinesis of the mid-distal amterior septum,
inferior, infero-lateral walls and apex. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional and global left ventricular
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

[**2185-5-26**] TEE:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid anterior, anteroseptal,
and lateral walls, hypokinesis of the basal lateral wall,
akinesis of the apical septum, anterior, and lateral walls, and
akinesis of the apex. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results at time of surgery.

POST-BYPASS:

Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. 2+ Mitral
regurgitation present. Aorta is intact post decannulation. Rest
of the examination is unchanged

Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICINE COURSE:

PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION:
Ms. [**Known lastname 109293**] is a 68F with a strong family history of early
CAD, long-standing RA, and hypertension who presents with
worsening dyspnea on exertion, found to have 3VD during cardiac
catherization.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:

#. NSTEMI: Patient's anginal equivalent is shortness of breath
and a tightness in her throat. EKG on admission revealed
new/worse STD in I, aVL, V5-V6, consistent with LCx territory,
and troponin elevation to 0.12, so patient had NSTEMI.  Cardiac
enzymes continued to trend up until morning of HD2, when patient
was taken to CABG and peaked at 0.18. Cardiac cath on day of
admission showed 3 vessel coronary isease.  Her A1c checked on
admission was 5.3.  Lipid panel showed total cholesterol 215 and
LDL 103. Patient was maintained on heparin gtt until she went to
CABG.  She was continued on atorvastatin 80 and a full dose
aspirin.  She was started on metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].  She never
received plavix in anticipation of CABG.

# Systolic CHF: Patient has no prior diagnosis, but is noted to
have global hypokinesis on TTE on day of admission, consistent
with multivessel CAD, and EF 30-35%.  She was noted to be volume
overloaded on admission, was given lasix 10mg IV x 1, as she is
lasix naive, and appeared euvolemic on exam with no peripheral
edema or pulmonary crackles.  She was started on Metoprolol 25mg
[**Hospital1 **] started on admission. She will remain on lasix on DC for 7
days. This will be discontinued then,

#. Hypertension:  Remained normotensive throughout
hospitalization.  Home Verapamil, HCTZ were held, and Metoprolol
was started as above. On DC her Ve
