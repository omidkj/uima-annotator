10.  Lipitor.
11.  Toprol XL 25 po q.d.

transferred in.

He came in on the Cardiology Service and was referred to
Cardiothoracic Surgery.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination his temperature was
97.6 with a heart rate of 66 in sinus rhythm.  Blood pressure
130/80.  Respirations 20.  Satting 95% on room air.  His
fasting blood sugar at that time was 205.  He was alert,
oriented and in no acute distress.  His lungs were clear
bilaterally.  His heart was regular rate and rhythm.  His
abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  His groin had no
hematoma or bruit.  His peripheral pulses were present with
greater palpation felt on the left rather then the right.
Extremities were warm and showed no signs of edema.

His existing cardiomyopathy was documented, a prior EF of
approximately 20% and he was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**]
of Cardiothoracic Surgery.  Also at the time of
catheterization at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital it was noted that he did
have a femoral artery dissection, which was treated
conservatively at the time and transfer proceeded.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 6.7,
hematocrit 39.4, platelet count 157,000, PT 12.7, PTT 22.4,
INR 1.1, sodium 140, K 4.2, chloride 100, bicarb 30, BUN 27,
creatinine 1.5, which was down from 1.7 and a blood sugar of
192.  Electrocardiogram showed Q waves in 2, 3 and F and T
wave inversions in 1 and AVL as well as V4 through V6.  He
also had a .[**Street Address(2) 1755**] depressions in 1 and 2 and [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depressions in V4 through V6, ST elevations in V1 through V2
and did complain of chest pressure when he was transferred
in.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Over the ensuing days the patient was
started on intravenous heparin given his known.
Cardiomyopathy cardiology followed him for a couple of days
on nitroglycerin and heparin drips to see whether or not it
was possible to do viability study on him to determine
whether or not he could have coronary artery bypass grafting
or whether in fact PCI would be sufficient and whether or not
there was a heart vessel that could be revitalized.  He
remained on the Cardiology Service on Metoprolol, Lasix,
Moexipril, aspirin and Simvastatin.  He remained on
nitroglycerin drip with good blood pressure of 125/66.  He
did show some signs of congestive heart failure and was on
fluid restriction as well as a limited sodium diet.  He
remained on sliding scale regular insulin.  His chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease was treated with Flovent and
Atrovent.  Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital did
show severe three vessel disease and ejection fraction of
approximately 25% on echocardiogram with inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis.  Again please note the
catheterization was complicated by a nonflow limiting femoral
artery dissection, which was treated conservatively.  He did
have a prior four to six month history of chest tightness
primarily associated with orthopnea and exertional shortness
of breath, plus minus heaviness worsening prior to admission.
He was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**], because of his chest discomfort
and remained on his intravenous drips.  He was not clinically
in heart failure at the time.  He remained on heparin and
intravenous nitrates for now with a plan to give him a rest
and pursue viability studies in preparation for possible PCI,
possible coronary artery bypass graft with ventricular assist
device placed stent.

On [**1-12**] he was seen again for preop check by cardiac
surgery team while he was still on the Cardiology Service.
His creatinine was 1.6 on that day and his liver function
tests and total bilirubin were normal as was his albumin at
that time.  His chest x-ray was negative and a new
echocardiogram had been ordered as well as carotid duplex
ultrasound to assess his risk of operation.  On [**1-13**]
the vascular laboratory preliminary reports showed no
significant stenosis on his right side, but a 40 to 60%
stenosis of his left internal carotid artery.  It was also
noted that he probably had iliac disease and would require
perhaps some angioplasty PTA stenting of his iliac to allow
intraaortic balloon placement prior to him going to the
Operating Room if coronary artery bypass graft was to be
pursued.  He was also seen by the Advanced Heart Failure
Program with recommendations for laboratory work and
pretransplant testing and was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in
consultation from the Heart Failure Service who also
recommended an MRI to evaluate if there is any viability and
to definitely place an intraaortic balloon pump and continue
on with the transplant evaluation and then coronary artery
bypass graft.  The patient remained comfortable on the floor
and had no pain at that time with his intravenous heparin,
intravenous nitroglycerin.  He continued with daily Lasix.
The MRI showed viability of the mid ventricular segment of
the anterior septum and anterior free wall, but the rest of
his heart was scar and another discussion ensued between
cardiology and cardiac surgery whether or not he would
benefit from having a PCI of his left anterior descending
coronary artery and this plan was discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**].

On [**1-16**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 401**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] the cardiology staff physician
reviewed the films again with several cardiologist and agreed
that the right coronary artery was proximally occluded and
that there were no collaterals in the inferoposterior wall
consistent with the fact that this wall was scar not
salvageable.  They agreed that there was a long proximal left
anterior descending coronary artery lesion that appeared to
be stentable, but would probably require two grafts and a
large ramus with a stentable proximal lesion.  They agreed
the initial plan was try PCI the following Monday to treat
the left anterior descending coronary artery lesion and see
how he did after the left anterior descending coronary artery
PCI and then consider him for stent of the ramus intermedius
down the road depending how he did.  Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 10875**] note.  The patient was seen by case management given
his extended stay.  On the 24th the patient did have an
episodes of chest pain and dizziness.  He remained on his
drips.  It was a single episode, which was not repeated
during the day.  The patient was given Mucomyst treatment in
preparation for possible dye load in catheterization
laboratory.  After discussion again on the 26th with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the plan was to proceed with coronary
artery bypass graft and not PCI and the patient would have
right femoral artery angioplasty and possible stenting so
that a balloon pump could be placed preoperatively.

On [**1-19**] the patient went to the catheterization
laboratory for abdominal aortic and bilateral distal
extremity run off with PTA and stenting times one of the
right common iliac artery given his severe obstruction.  The
abdominal aorta showed mild disease without critical lesions.
