HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 75-year-old woman
with coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2149**], diabetes mellitus type 2, gout who
presented with several hours of shortness of breath and
epigastric/lower sternum discomfort which developed while the
patient was sleeping.  Denied any other associated symptoms.
The discomfort was pressure like and improved with
nitroglycerin spray.  Patient has had no chest pain since
then but continued subjective shortness of breath although
satting well on room air.  Denies edema.

Also, patient with upper respiratory infection over the past
few days.  Also with right great toe pain identical to
previous gout episodes.  The patient is followed by numerous
doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital6 1708**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.0, heart
rate 65, pressure 140/49, satting 99% on room air.  Physical
examination:  Pleasant, elderly woman in no apparent
distress.  Heart with a soft systolic murmur.  Lungs with

Remainder of physical examination within normal limits,
however, notable for only trace pulses in the bilateral lower
extremities as well as only trace edema in the bilateral
lower extremities.

DIAGNOSTIC DATA ON ADMISSION:  Per the patient she had a
treadmill exercise stress test with imaging in [**3-/2154**] which
was reportedly normal.
Echocardiogram done at [**Hospital6 1708**]
[**2154-3-22**] with ejection fraction of 40 to 45%, akinesis in
the distal anterior septum, mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation, hypokinesis in inferior and posterior walls,
hypokinesis in the inferior septum.

CBC on admission:  White blood count 15 with 80% neutrophils,
0 bands, hematocrit 34, platelets 270.  Chemistries within
normal limits except for BUN and creatinine of 62/2.2.
Troponin of 0.39, CK of 84.

Chest x-ray with bilateral pleural effusions and prominent
pulmonary vasculature consistent with left ventricular heart
failure.  ECG with normal sinus rhythm at 65 beats per
minute, normal intervals, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations at III, 0.[**Street Address(2) 18425**] depressions in I and aVL, less than 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] depressions
in V4 to 6 all unchanged from the previous ECG from [**Hospital6 **] dated 04/[**2153**].

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 75-year-old
woman with coronary artery disease status post coronary
artery bypass graft as well as diabetes who presented with
shortness of breath and lower chest/epigastric pain which
resolved.

1.  Coronary artery disease:  Patient's ECG without
significant changes.  Patient's creatinine kinases flat and
not consistent with current myocardial infarction.  Patient's
troponins likely elevated related to her renal insufficiency
but may represent older myocardial ischemia from several days
prior to admission.

Patient was initially started on Heparin drip in the
Emergency Room, but this was discontinued after approximately
six hours as the patient was entirely symptom free and
patient's enzymes were largely flat.  Patient underwent
Persantine MIBI stress test on [**2155-3-3**] which showed mild
to moderate lateral reversible perfusion defect as well as
moderate fixed anterior wall defect with an estimated
ejection fraction of 42%.

Based on this information and after weighing the pros and
cons of possible renal effects of catheterization and after
extensive discussions with the family and medical team,
decision was made for patient to undergo catheterization,
which she underwent on [**2155-3-5**], which showed 20% left
main, 100% proximal left anterior descending, 80% left
circumflex, 70% obtuse marginal 1, 100% mid right coronary
artery, occluded saphenous vein graft to posterior descending
artery graft, patent left internal mammary artery graft to
left anterior descending graft.

Patient's left circumflex lesion was thought to be the likely
culprit for her symptoms and was status post angioplasty with
good TIMI 3 flow afterwards.  However, this area was not able
to be stented due to the anatomy.

Patient did not have any further episodes of chest pain
throughout her hospital stay and tolerated procedure well.
The patient was continued on aspirin as well as Lipitor
throughout hospital stay.  Patient was on Metoprolol
initially which was held peripost catheterization due to
hemodynamic reasons and then restarted and titrated up to,
which the patient tolerated well.

Patient was also started on Plavix, which she should probably
be on for life.  Patient to follow up with her outpatient
cardiologist for further management.

2.  Congestive heart failure/pump:  Patient with significant
shortness of breath and chest x-ray and clinical findings
consistent with congestive heart failure at admission.
Patient was diuresed gently on the floor.  At Catheterization
hemodynamics revealed an elevated right and left pressure
including PA pressure of 60/25, mean wedge of 32, LVEDP of
35, and cardiac index of 2.2.

Echocardiogram on [**2155-3-6**] showed an ejection fraction of
30 to 35% with 3+ mitral regurgitation and left ventricular
hypertrophy.  Patient continued low-sodium diet and weighed
daily with close ins and outs.

Patient's angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was held
and instead Hydralazine and Isordil were used for after load
reduction.  This was due to the patient's high creatinine,
which was at her baseline, and pericath with the dye load.

Due to the elevated filling pressures seen on
catheterization, the patient had an intra-aortic balloon pump
placed.  Patient was also started on Dobutamine drip.
Patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit overnight due
to these interventions and she was stable throughout her
Coronary Care Unit time.  The intra-aortic balloon pump was
removed and the patient was off of Dobutamine within 12 hours
of those being started.  Patient remained hemodynamically
stable throughout this time.

At the time of discharge the patient was satting very well on
room air, as well as ambulating.  Was restarted on her home
Lasix dose of 80 once a day.  Close outpatient follow up for
this.

3.  Rhythm:  Patient in sinus rhythm obtained on telemetry
throughout her hospital stay.

4.  Diabetes:  Patient maintained with regular insulin
sliding scale throughout her hospital stay.

5.  Renal:  Patient's baseline creatinine in the low to mid 2
range per outpatient cardiologist.  Patient also has an
outpatient nephrologist who presumably has done some workup
for the patient's renal insufficiency.  Patient was given
Mucomyst peri cardiac catheterization.
Patient's SPEP and UPEP were also sent, and at the time of
discharge the UPEP came back normal and SPEP was still
pending.  Plan outpatient follow up.

6.  Anemia:  Patient received one unit packed red blood cells
on [**2155-3-6**] for a hematocrit of 27.  Patient was
asymptomatic at this time with no signs or symptoms of active
bleed.  Patient's hematocrit increased appropriately once
stable throughout the end of her hospital stay.

7.  Gout:  Patient was initially placed on Colchicine for
likely gouty flare in her right great toe.  However, this was
discontinued and patient was given three days of Prednisone
20 q.d. for this flare.  Patient also given Percocet p.r.n.

8.  Previous diarrhea/hematochezia:  Patient did not have
either of
