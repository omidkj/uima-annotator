Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 41 year old morbidly obese
gentleman who came to the hospital in the setting of
cellulitis of the left leg with hypotension requiring fluid
resuscitation and desaturation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 41 year old
with a history of diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity, asthma,
obstructive sleep apnea and coronary artery disease.  He was
admitted to the [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 620**] on
[**2129-9-4**], for cellulitis and sepsis.  He had cut his left leg
with a saw blade on [**2129-9-2**], and subsequently developed
erythema of the leg.

On [**2129-9-4**], he awoke with fever, chills and rigors and went
to [**Hospital3 4527**] where he was noted to have a temperature
of 104 degrees and also appeared to be uncomfortable and
short of breath.  His saturations were 92% in room air and
improved to 97 to 98% with four liters nasal cannula. His
blood pressure at that time ranged from 120/60 to 150/90.  He
was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in the [**Hospital3 29718**].

For the left leg cellulitis, he was started on Vancomycin,
Clindamycin and Levofloxacin.  His blood pressure
subsequently dropped to 80 systolic and the patient was
started on Neo-Synephrine infusion and had aggressive fluid
resuscitation.  The left leg cellulitis seemed to improve and
the Neo-Synephrine was weaned off.

On [**2129-9-6**], the patient was noted to have increasing
respiratory distress.  Chest x-ray showed evidence of
pulmonary edema which was treated with Lasix. There was some
response initially but the respiratory distress was not
relieved.  He was placed on CPAP and then a nonrebreathing
mask but the saturations were still in the low 90s with
arterial oxygen tension of 62 to 74 mmHg. At this point, the
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**].

In the MICU, he was intubated by awake fiberoptic intubation.
Oxygenation seemed to improve with assist control ventilation
and the FIO2 was gradually weaned from 80% to 60% oxygen.

ALLERGIES:  Cephalosporins and Morphine Sulfate.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father has hypertension.  Mother had
emphysema at the age of 63.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  He is on
disability.  He smokes a pipe or cigar occasionally.  No
history of ethanol or intravenous drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.9, heart rate 100
beats per minute, normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure 86/33
and respiratory rate was 30.  After intubation he was
ventilated on pressure support of 20 with a PEEP of 10 and he
was on 100% oxygen.  He was sedated with Propofol and
Lorazepam.  The pupils are equal, reactive to light.
Extraocular movements are intact.  Neck was obese, unable to
see the jugular venous pressure.  Pulmonary - There was no
wheeze.  Distant breath sounds are heard.  Crackles at the
bases.  Cardiac - regular heart sounds, S1 and S2, sounds
distant, no murmur appreciated.  The abdomen is obese, soft,
nontender, bowel sounds heard, abdominal wall was edematous.
Extremities 3+ peripheral edema left leg, torso edematous
with palpable pulses.  Skin - erythema left ankle above the
cut.  Neurologic - alert and appropriate despite the low
oxygen saturation.

LABORATORY DATA:  White cell count was 12.2, hematocrit 36.6,
platelets 211,000.  Sodium 143, potassium 3.9, chloride 99,
bicarbonate 31, blood urea nitrogen 26, creatinine 0.7, blood
sugar 136.  Creatinine kinase was 96 and troponin was
negative.  Arterial blood gases on 100% oxygen pH 7.47, pCO2
47, pO2 90.

Chest x-ray was of poor quality and diffuse alveolar
infiltrate suggestive of pulmonary edema and congestive heart
failure. could not rule out adult respiratory distress
syndrome.

Ultrasound of the lower limbs showed normal compressibility
of the lower limb veins which was negative for deep vein
thrombosis.

Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with normal axis,
with no evidence of ischemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiac - Hemodynamic instability requiring inotropics
initially.  He was monitored with a PA catheter.  The
inotropes were gradually weaned.  After the initial course of
hemodynamic instability, there was a face of hypertension
where the blood pressure was difficult to control requiring
increasing the doses of the antihypertensive medications.
There was one episode of fast atrial fibrillation with
hemodynamic instability which required cardioversion.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient required awake fiberoptic
intubation for control of airway.  Initially the oxygen
requirements were very high with FIO2 of 1.

Over a period of time, the oxygenation was weaned from 100%
to 60 to 40%.  During this two to three week period, the
oxygenation was labile and this was treated by intense
physical therapy and nebulizers.  The oxygenation gradually
improved.

Percutaneous tracheostomy was performed on [**2129-9-27**].  The
oxygenation improved gradually and for the past two weeks,
there has been no evidence of respiratory distress.  Adequate
oxygenation was maintained over the tracheostomy mask with
40% oxygen.  The saturations are 100% and the carbon dioxide
levels have been ranging from 35 to 45 mmHg during this time.

3.  Renal - Aggressive diuresis during the MICU stay.  The
patient was treated with Lasix 20 to 80 mg p.r.n. and a
negative balance of one liter to 1.5 liters was maintained to
wean from the ventilator.  There was one episode of prerenal
failure which improved spontaneously and he did not require
dialysis or hemofiltration during his stay in the MICU.

4.  Gastrointestinal - Due to the long-standing diabetes
mellitus, he was prone for recurrent gastroparesis. He
tolerated only forced pyloric feeds. There was one episode of
coffee ground vomitus but the patient had a stable hematocrit
and therefore did not need an endoscopy.

5.  Endocrine - Very large insulin requirements and poorly
controlled diabetes mellitus. The patient had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
consultation and he was started on U-500 regular insulin, now
has a better blood sugar control.

6.  Hematology - The patient's hematocrit has been stable
during his MICU stay and he did not require any transfusions
during the hospital stay.

7.  Infectious disease - Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus positive and positive blood cultures.   Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive fungal cystitis.  He
was Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive in
sputum on [**2129-10-19**].  Clostridium difficile positive on
[**2129-9-10**], and on [**2129-10-6**].  This is being treated with Flagyl
at present. On [**2129-10-17**], the C. difficile toxin assay was
negative.

8.  Musculoskeletal - Back pain which has gradually resolved
and received physical therapy.

9.  Nutrition - The patient r
