Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old male with history of COPD, CHF, PAF, CRI presenting
with dyspnea and hypoxia likely combination COPD exacerbation
and CHF exacerbation.
.
1.  SOB:  Likely combination CHF and COPD.  For COPD, the
patient received Albuterol and Atrovent Nebs q6hrs, and prn
Albuterol Nebs.  The patient was also started on Prednisone and
Azithromycin.  As the patient's respiratory status improved rhe
steroids were tapered. For his CHF the patient was diuresed with
Lasix.  Electrolytes were monitored and repleted as needed.
.
The patient's course was complicated on [**2182-11-3**] when nursing
observed that the patient was having more labored breathing
despite multiple nebulizer treatment.  A CXR showed increasing
small bilateral pleural effusions and collapse of the left lower
lobe.  With more diuresis and aggressive chest PT, the patient's
respiratory status stabalized.
.
2.  PAF/Arrhythmias: The patient's Coumadin was held throughout
most of his hospital course because of supratherapeutic INRs.
The patient was restarted on Coumadin after the cardiac
interventions.
.
3. AF/RVR: The patient hospital course was also complicated by
periods of tacchycardia to the 140s and bradycardia to the 40s.
Despite attempts to control the patient's heart rate with
Diltiazem and Lopressor, his heart was often 100's - 120's.  On
[**11-7**] the patient's heart rate fell to the 20s, SBP in the 60s.
The patient was aymptomatic.  Atropine and NS bolus was given
with no improvement in heart rate or blood pressure.  The
patient was transferred to the CCU.  In the CCU the patient's
blood pressure recovered to the 110s/60s with HR 50s-60s and
continued to be asymptomatic.  The patient was medically managed
with Diltiazem and transferred to the floor.  Despite this
conservative manangement the decision was made for the patient
to have  a pace maker placed and an AV ablation. Following these
interventions, the patient's heart rate was maintained at 80.
.
3. Ischemia: On admission the patient had some ischemic changes
on his EKG.  A stress test was done which showed no anginal type
symptoms or interpretable EKG changes with high grade AEA.  In
the setting of having ischemia the decision was made to
discharge the patient on Toprol XL 50.
.
4.  Dementia: The patient was continued on  Namenda and Aricept
without any complications.
