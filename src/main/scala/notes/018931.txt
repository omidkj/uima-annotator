HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
gentleman who had previously been diagnosed with esophageal
cancer and had undergone chemotherapy with cisplatin and
5-fluorouracil and radiation therapy.  He had a recent
positron emission tomography scan which was found to be
negative.

When the patient initially presented, it was with an upper
gastrointestinal bleed in [**2148-4-16**] which required 4
units of packed red blood cells.  An
esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15532**] esophagus with
an 8-cm fungating distal esophageal adenocarcinoma.  After
this was the time in which the patient received his
chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

The patient presented to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for an [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**]
[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy for management of his esophageal cancer.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  In terms of
preoperative laboratories, his white blood cell count was
6.4, hematocrit was 34, and platelets were 200.  Blood urea
nitrogen was 16 and creatinine was 1.2.  Potassium was 4.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Positron emission tomography
scan results as noted.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   In terms of initial
physical examination, the patient was in no acute distress.
His sclerae were anicteric.  There were no palpable lymph
nodes in the neck in the supracervical or axillary region.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart
was regular in rate and rhythm.  His abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  His calves were nontender, and
he had no edema.  His pulses were [**2-20**] in the upper and lower
extremities.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The patient was admitted
on [**2148-8-26**] and underwent an [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], during which he had an estimated
blood loss of 800 cc.  Otherwise, there were no
intraoperative complications.  Intraoperatively, there was a
finding of tumor at the gastroesophageal junction and firm
celiac nodes, but no other evidence of metastasis.

Postoperatively, the patient was taken to the Postanesthesia
Care Unit where he was hypotensive.  Therefore, the patient
was placed on a Levophed drip.  His postoperative hematocrit
levels were 29.8 and 30; respectively.

Due to the fact that the patient required the Levophed drip,
he remained in the Postanesthesia Care Unit on postoperative
day zero and on postoperative day one.

The patient had his epidural stopped, and he was transfused
with 2 units of packed red blood cells.  He was also given
aggressive fluid hydration, as his blood pressure was thought
to be secondary to his volume loss.  The patient continued to
have serial hematocrit levels followed which stabilized in
the mid 20s.

On postoperative day two, the patient developed some
respiratory distress and was found to have a central venous
pressure of 11.  His oxygen saturations had dropped down into
the 80s.  He was treated with aggressive chest physical
therapy and nebulizers treatment, but it was felt that this
was likely secondary to volume overload as he was positive
7500 cc of fluid on postoperative day zero.  His Levophed
drip had been weaned that day.  His blood pressures were
returning into the 150s/60s and at times also to the 180s.

Given the patient's respiratory status, he was transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring.  At the time
of transfer to the Intensive Care Unit; notably, his
hematocrit was 27.6, and his blood urea nitrogen was 1.3, and
his arterial blood gas was 7.3/47/89/24 and -3.  His chest
x-ray showed some left lower lobe collapse and consolidation
which was stable and an unchanged right lower lobe opacity.

While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was again
aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix.  His hematocrit
remained stable and climbed to the upper 20s.  The patient
was continued on aggressive pulmonary toilet.

By postoperative day four, the patient was otherwise
clinically stable but continued to have some respiratory
difficulties with a notable arterial blood gas of
7.4/45/125/29 and 2.  He was started on tube feeds on this
day.  He subsequently underwent a barium swallow study which
showed no abnormalities.

By postoperative day five, the patient was doing quite well
and was ready for transfer to the floor pending bed
availability.  Notably, the patient did have occasional
episodes of atrial fibrillation while in the Intensive Care
Unit which were treated with intravenous Lopressor and did
resolve.  Given the patient's problem with this, he was held
in the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative days five and
six.

These issues had resolved by postoperative day seven, and the
patient had been diuresing well and his atrial fibrillation
was controlled with metoprolol.  He was started on a clear
liquid diet.  By postoperative day seven, the patient
tolerated a clear liquid diet well.  Otherwise, the patient's
chest tube was out by postoperative day eight.

By postoperative day nine, the patient was doing well and was
without complaints.  He had remained afebrile.  He was making
good urine.  His respiratory status was good.  His abdomen
looked soft and was nontender.  His incision was clean.  He
was tolerating his tube feeds well.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION/CONDITION:  Given that the patient was
doing well in all these aspects, it was determined that he
could be discharge to an extended care rehabilitation
facility.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (The patient was discharged on the
following medications)
1.  Roxicet elixir 5 cc to 10 cc by mouth q.4-6h.
2.  Ipratropium inhaler q.6h. as needed.
3.  Albuterol inhaler q.6h. as needed.
4.  Lopressor 75 mg by mouth three times per day (hold for a
systolic blood pressure of less than 90).
5.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
6.  Miconazole nitrate powder one application three times per
day.
7.  Lansoprazole 30-mg suspension by mouth once per day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in 10 to 14 days.
2.  The patient was also to follow up with his primary care
physician.
3.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1728**].
4.  In terms of his tube feeds, he was to continue on his
tube feeds at 100 cc cycled from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.  The
patient was to continue on post gastrectomy diet with six
small meals per day.  His tube feeds were Impact with fiber
at full strength.
