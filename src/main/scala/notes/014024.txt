Radiological Studies:
Head CT [**9-11**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Large left subgaleal hematoma with laceration and no evidence
of fracture.

C-Spine CT [**9-11**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Anterolisthesis (5-mm) of C5 on C6, with right locked and
left perched
facet. Associated fractures at C5 and C6 right transverse
process with
involvement of the transverse foramen. CTA is recommended to
evaluate for
vertebral artery injury given the fractures of the transverse
foramen.

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvic [**9-11**]:
IMPRESSIONS:
No evidence for acute intrathoracic or intra-abdominal injury.

CTA of Neck [**9-11**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild narrowing of the proximal right vertebral artery from C4
through C6, in the region of the right transverse foramen
fractures. This may be due to edema or spasm from nearby
hematoma. There is no definite intraluminal flap to suggest
dissection and no definite evidence of intramural hematoma on
the subsequent MRI. Allowing for vertebral artery dissection,
MRI with fat- saturation could be obtained for further
evaluation.
2. Redemonstration of traumatic injury at the C5-C6 level with
anterolisthesis of C5 on C6, a right C5 locked facet, and C5 and
C6 right
transverse process fractures as well as a fracture through the
left C5
pedicle.

MRI C-Spine [**9-12**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. C5-C6 anterolisthesis with slight narrowing of the spinal
canal. No other cervical spinal malalignment.
2. Edema in the interspinous ligaments from C4 through C7
suggestive of
ligamentous injury.
3. No evidence for abnormal signal within the spinal cord. No
evidence for
intradural abnormality.
4. Fractures characterized on recent CT scan are not visualized
on this
study.

Head CT [**9-14**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process, with decrease in size
of left
large subgaleal hematoma.

Chest X-Ray [**9-14**]:
IMPRESSION: Frontal and lateral view shows moderate-to-severe
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette shown on CTA on [**9-11**] to reflect cardiomegaly and not pericardial effusion. Lungs
are clear. There is no pleural effusion or good evidence for
central adenopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-11**] after being involvedin
high speed MVC versus a tree.  Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient
was taken urgent to the operating room for repair of an
extremely substantial scalp laceration, and intubation. Imaging
performed in the emergency department identified injuries to his
cervical spine requiring surgical fixation. This was performed
on [**9-12**] without incident. Post-operatively, there were JP drains
in both the galeal wound as well as cervical wound. Both drains
were removed on POD#2. On [**9-14**], patient began to spike
temperatures to 102 degrees, blood cultures, urinalysis, and
chest x-rays were performed. Chest x-ray was read as negative
for infection, however a large cardiac silouhette was
identified. This was thought to be due to malrotation,however a
Surface echo was recommended, and performed to further rule this
out. He subsequently has also had unremarkable urinalysis, and
stable elevated WBC. Temperatures have continued to spike
despite any clear source for infection. Wounds have been clean,
dry, and intact. His temperature elevations are thereby thought
to be due to chronic atelactasis from poor compliance with
incentive spirometry usage. He was then discharged on [**9-17**] in
the setting of a normal temperature(99.5), with instructions to
survey his incision daily as well as taking his temperature
twice daily. He was also given instructions to continue to use
his incentive spirometry. Follow up plans for scalp laceration
repair, discussed in patient discharge.
