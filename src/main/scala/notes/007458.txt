Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4588**]
Chief Complaint:
Vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 87 year-old female with a history of Diastolic heart
failure, pulmonary hypertension, Chronic kideny disease, and
atrial fibrillation on Coumadin who presents with vomiting. Pt
lives at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. She reports having a cough with
productive sputum and fever about 2 weeks ago. This resolved and
then she developed nausea and vomiting over the past few days.
She has had decreased PO intake, only tolerating tea and
crackers. No fever, chills, CP, SOB, abdominal pain,
hematemesis, diarrhea. Labs at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab today revealed Na
128 and K 2.5. She was transferred from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab to the
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED initial vitals were: T 98.1, BP 152/49, HR 53, RR 20,
O2sat 100%. She received a CT scan which incidentally showed a
pericardial effusion. This was evaluated by Cardiology who
performed a bedside ECHO which confirmed the effusion but did
not show tamponade. In the ED, she received 40mEq potassium PO
and 40mEq IV, 1 litre normal saline, and zofran. ECG showed
PVC's but no acute ischemic changes. She is admitted to the MICU
for electrolyte abnormalities of Na 123, K 2.8, and pericardial
effusion.
.

ECG official read: Atrial fibrillation with ventricular
premature complexes including a triplet Nonspecific ST-T
abnormalities. Since previous tracing of [**2153-1-22**], further ST-T
wave changes suggested but baseline artifact makes comparison
difficult.

.
[**2154-3-27**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No evidence of consolidation. Mild
fluid overload.
.
[**2154-3-27**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage.
Enlarged ventricles out of proportion to the sulci which likely
represents central atrophy given stability over time.
.
[**2154-3-27**] CT ABD/PELV: IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate pericardial effusion and signs of fluid overload
concerning for heart failure. Recommend clinical correlation.
2. Pancreatic cysts, better evaluated on recent MRCP.
3. Left kidney hypo- and hyperdense lesions, similar in
appearance.
4. Vascular calcifications.
5. Normal appendix.
6. Lucency within the sacrum, stable and likely benign etiology.

.
[**2154-3-28**] [**Month/Day/Year **]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Due
to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Diastolic function could not be
assessed. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of
tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided
pressures. Pericardial constriction cannot be excluded.
IMPRESSION: Image quality and frequent ectopy make
interpretation difficult. There is a small circumferential
effusion without tamponade (signs of tamponade may be absent in
the presence of elevated right sided pressures). Pericardial
constriction cannot be excluded. LV function is probably normal.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
87 F with a history of diastolic heart failure, pulmonary HTN,
CKD, and a-fib on Coumadin who presents with vomiting, right
lower quadrant tenderness, and incidental pericardial effusion.
.
#. Nausea/Vomiting: Unclear etiology. Possibly gastroenteritis
vs primary electrolyte abnormality contributing to nausea.
Obstruction much less likely as patient had BM on day prior to
admission. Patient ruled out for MI. No acute pathology on CT
scan.  Pt has known chronic biliary dilatation and AP is
elevated, but not far from baseline. Currently denies nausea and
no vomiting since admit. Appears euvolemic now and has improving
crackles on lung exam.  Tolerating PO well.
.
#. Pericardial effusion: Evaluated by cardiology in the ED who
performed a bedside ECHO which did not show tamponade. The
patient is currently hemodynamically stable. Pericardial
effusion was also noted on TTE from [**3-13**] and can be seen on CT
chest from [**2150**] indicating this is likely a chronic effusion.
Patient has ruled out for MI.
.
#. Hyponatremia: Patient arrived with Na of 123 and appeared
hypovolemic on exam likely [**1-7**] N/V above.  Urine lytes were not
sent until she was repleted/given lasix. She was given 2 L total
of NS with correction of her Na to 133 by day of discharge.
.
#. Afib: INR is supratherapeutic at 4.3 on day of discharge.
- held coumadin while in house
.
#. Chronic diastolic heart failure: She was given 2 L NS in
ED/MICU and lasix was restarted when her N/V and hyponatremia
resolved.  Currently appears euvolemic on exam.
- Furosemide daily
.
#. CKD: Cr remained at baseline during hospitalization.
- renally dose all medications
.
#. Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
- re-start amlodipine
- cons
