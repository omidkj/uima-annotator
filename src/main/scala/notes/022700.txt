HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old woman
with chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis who has been
treated with Tobramycin and cefepime for the past seven days
for                     -resistant Pseudomonas.  She was
initially discharged on [**2189-5-1**] but returned on [**2189-5-4**] for
placement of a PICC line.  On [**2189-5-7**], she was seen by VNA
and had blood work sent.  At that time, her BUN was 56,
creatinine 4.5, Tobramycin level 11.5.

On the date of admission, the patient claims that she tripped
and fell and hit her head.  She does not recall any details.
She denied loss of consciousness.  She denied any other
symptoms such as fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
and dysuria.  She denied any changes in urinary frequency.

In the Emergency Room, she did not have a good noninvasive
blood pressure [**Location (un) 1131**].  She was started on dopamine and then
Neo-Synephrine wide open as well as Levophed.  She was given
ceftriaxone and Flagyl for presumed infection.  She had a
head CT which was negative for bleed.  Chest and abdomen CT
were performed because of a hematocrit of 26 without any
evidence of bleed.  The lungs demonstrated worsening
infiltrate versus interstitial edema.  She had a right
subclavian line placed without complications.  Throughout the
hypotensive episode, she was conversant and appropriately
answering questions.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate
87, blood pressure 96/44, 02 saturation 94% on 3 liters nasal
cannula.  General:  This is a chronically ill appearing woman
in no apparent distress.  HEENT:  The sclerae were clear.
The oropharynx was dry without JVD.  Lungs:  Diffuse crackles
and inspiratory wheezes.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1, S2, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  Without lower extremity edema, good distal
pulses.  Neurologic: Alert and oriented times three, but
falls asleep.  Cranial nerves, II through XII, were grossly
intact.  Strength was [**5-25**], distal reflexes 2+ throughout.

LABORATORY DATA/STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 8.4,
hematocrit 26.6, platelets 192,000.  PTT 34.7, INR 1.6,
132/5.1, 96/22, 70/6, 1.76.  ABGs 7.32, 45, 70, lactate 1.5.
CK 199.  Troponin less than 0.3. Calcium 8.1, phosphorus 5.6,
magnesium 1.6.  U/A negative.

Chest x-ray revealed right subclavian in place.  Question of
right middle lobe infiltrate and worsening CHF.

Abdominal CT and head CT were both without acute process.

EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 95, LAD, IVCD, without
acute ST-T changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 60-year-old woman admitted with
hypotension and new acute renal failure.

1.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Likely secondary to dehydration and
Tobramycin toxicity in the setting of an ACE inhibitor.  The
patient was aggressively rehydrated and the pressors were
taken off.  Her creatinine began to normalize and upon
discharge her creatinine was 1.6.  The patient's ACE
inhibitor was held and the patient was not treated with
Tobramycin anymore.

2.  HYPOTENSION:  Likely secondary to sepsis.  The patient
was also dehydrated.  Aggressive fluid easily removed with
pressors and corrected acute renal failure at the same time.
The patient had blood cultures, cultures of sputum and urine
cultures as well.

3.  PSEUDOMONAS PNEUMONIA:  The patient continued double
coverage as per Infectious Disease.  The patient was treated
with Zosyn and cefepime in the hospital for a total course of
14 days.  The patient tolerated that course exceptionally
well.

4.  OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA:  The patient continued home
CPAP.

5.  ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY:  The patient was given stress-dose
steroids and then switched to p.o. steroids with a taper.
The steroids will also treat her lung disease.

6.  BREAST CANCER:  The patient had Arimidex held until her
creatinine normalized and she was restarted on it.

7.  DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient's Metformin was held
while she was in acute renal failure.  She was covered with
insulin sliding scale.  She was restarted on her NPH.  The
patient was sent home without Metformin.  She was sent home
on insulin sliding scale 18 NPH a.m., 5 NPH p.m.

8.  INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE:  The patient's Imuran was
held.  The patient was already on stress-dose steroids.  The
patient's steroids began taper.  The patient is to continue
taper from 35 of prednisone down to 15 of prednisone every
three days by 5.

9.  DEPRESSION: The patient's antidepressants were held until
her acute renal failure resolved.  Once the acute renal
failure resolved, the patient was restarted on
antidepressants without any problem.

10.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient was found to be
guaiac positive.  The patient will have outpatient workup
after three months of anticoagulation.

11.  LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY CLOT:  The patient had a left upper
extremity clot status post PICC line.  When the PICC line was
pulled, the patient still had thrombophlebitis.  The patient
was started with heparin to Coumadin.  The patient has
follow-up in [**Hospital 197**] Clinic and with her own PCP.

12.  DISPOSITION: The patient is sent home with visiting VNA
services.  The patient was full code throughout the stay
without events.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Acute renal failure.
2.  Pseudomonas pneumonia.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
