Service:  CARDIOTHOR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 60 year old male
transferred from [**Hospital6 3872**] where he was
admitted on [**2161-10-15**], with a chief complaint of
shortness of breath and chest discomfort.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year old man
with a history of CAD status post CABG in [**2148**], admitted to
[**Hospital6 3872**] on [**10-15**] with shortness of
breath and diaphoresis, complaining of chest pain times six
days prior to admission.  On the day of admission patient had
an episode of chest pain associated with diaphoresis and EKG
changes at that time with ST depressions in V4 through [**Street Address(2) 47088**] elevation in leads 3 and F.  Patient had positive troponin
at that time.  He was swanned and started on a Nitrocort
drip, but that had to be stopped due to hypotension.  After
that he was started on a dopamine drip which also was weaned
off on the day of transfer.  Cath done at [**Hospital6 3874**] showed EF of 15%, moderate mitral regurgitation.  All
saphenous vein grafts were down.  He had native left main
disease of 50%, total occlusion of circumflex, total
occlusion of LAD and RCA with diffuse disease.  En route to
[**Hospital1 69**] patient complained of
chest pain.  He was evaluated in the emergency room at [**Hospital1 1444**] and then brought to the
cardiac catheterization lab where an intra-aortic balloon
pump was placed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease status post MI, status post coronary artery bypass
grafting in [**2148**], hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, ETOH
use.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Enteric coated aspirin 325 q.d.,
Pravachol 20 mg q.d., Lovenox 70 mg b.i.d., Protonix 40 mg
q.d., nystatin swish and swallow 5 cc q.i.d., digoxin 0.125
q.d., Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Ativan p.r.n., Haldol p.r.n.,
albuterol and Atrovent nebs p.r.n.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive tobacco use.  Positive ETOH use.
No IV drug use.  Retired janitor.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, in general, in no acute
distress.  HEENT anicteric, EOMI, PERRLA.  JVD to jaw while
laying flat.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular S1, S2, tachycardiac.  Abdomen soft,
nondistended, nontender.  Groin on the right with
intra-aortic balloon pump in place.  Extremities pulses on
the right were palpable.  Foot was cool.  Neuro alert and
oriented times three.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.3, hematocrit 34.0, platelets
346.  PT 13.1, PTT 34.5, INR 1.1.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.5,
chloride 103, CO2 26, BUN 11, creatinine 0.9, glucose 94.
Albumin 3.3, AST 44, LDH 282, CK 37, alka phos 72, total bili
0.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission to the CCU patient was seen by
the cardiology service as well as the heart failure service
and also the cardiothoracic surgery service.  He was accepted
for coronary artery bypass grafting and on [**10-26**] patient
was brought to the operating room where he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting times five as well as mitral valve
repair.  In summary, patient had saphenous vein graft to LAD
and diagonal #2 sequentially, saphenous vein graft to
diagonal #1, saphenous vein graft to RPL and PDA sequentially
as well as mitral annuloplasty with a #28 [**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring.  He
tolerated the surgery well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.
Upon arrival in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit,
patient was noted to have a cool, mottled, left foot which
was the side that the intra-aortic balloon pump was on.  The
intra-aortic balloon pump was removed from the left groin and
replaced into the right groin and vascular surgery was
consulted.  Chest x-ray done to confirm balloon placement
showed that patient had right upper lobe and right middle
lobe collapse.  He underwent bronchoscopy for reexpansion of
the right upper and middle lobes.

For several days the patient remained unstable from a
cardiopulmonary standpoint.  He remained chemically paralyzed
and was on several cardioactive drugs including Levophed,
milrinone, Pitressin in addition to cisatracurium, propofol,
insulin and intra-aortic balloon pump at 1:1.  By
postoperative day three patient's respiratory status had
improved to the point where we were able to discontinue
cisatracurium.  During that period of time we were able to
wean the intra-aortic balloon pump and ultimately discontinue
the intra-aortic balloon pump also on postoperative day
three.  Over the next several days patient continued to be
more stable hemodynamically.  He was slowly weaned from his
Levophed drip during that period of time.  He was also weaned
from assist control mode to CPAP with pressure support on the
ventilator.  By postoperative day five patient's pressure
support had been weaned down to 5 with 5 of PEEP and 50%,
however, he was not able to generate sufficient tidal
volumes.  Chest x-ray done at that time showed a large right
pleural effusion.  A chest tube was placed which immediately
drained 700 cc and drained another 300 cc over the next
several hours.

Over the next several days the patient continued to make slow
progress.  As stated previously, he was slowly weaned off his
cardioactive drips with the exception of milrinone and
Pitressin which remained on.  On postoperative day 14 patient
was extubated.  Over the next several days patient was
successfully weaned off Pitressin and milrinone.  Following
the wean of Pitressin he did have several episodes of
nonsustained VT.  Following the successful wean of Pitressin,
patient was started on low dose beta blockade.  Over the next
several days patient's ventricular ectopy continued to be
monitored in the ICU setting.  By postoperative day 21 it was
felt that patient was stable and ready for transfer to [**Hospital6 33180**] where he would be evaluated for AICD
placement.

At the time of transfer patient's physical exam is as
follows.  Heart rate 86 sinus rhythm, blood pressure 91/67,
respiratory rate 20, O2 sat 97% on 3 liters nasal prong.
Neurologically alert and oriented times two to three.  Knows
he is in a hospital, although sometimes states the wrong
hospital.  Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  Remains
on amiodarone and Lopressor, heparin at 850 units per hour.
Respiratory lungs are coarse, productive cough of large
amounts of tan brown to blood tinged secretions.  GI abdomen
is soft, nondistended, nontender with positive bowel sounds.
Tolerating p.o.  Lower extremity exam unchanged.  No right
femoral pulse, biphasic dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial,
1+ left femoral pulse with biphasic dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial.  Left first, second and third toes with
demarcation.
