Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was initally seen in clinic.  Please see clinic note for
details. Patient was then seen in the pre-operative area, and
once again the severe risks associated with the procedure were
discussed with her and her family.  Seh again consented to the
procedure as she stated that she could no longer live
comfortably as she was, and wanted to do anything to get to a
better state of health, despite the risks.  In the operating
room the planned procedure was carried out (see operative note)
however, the patient became asystolic and ACLS protocol was
carried out.  She was asystolic for approximately 1 minute and
underwent chest compressions.  She was intubated and taken to
the ICU.  B/L chest tubes were placed, the right sided for the
operative site and the left for inspriatory deficit.

Her course from there on out was complicated mainly by a massive
air leak and was unable to take adequate inspiratory volumes in
order to maintain her oxygenation ad respiration.  She was awake
and alert for the majority of her stay.  A second right sided
chest tube was placed on POD 1, for residual apical
pneumothorax, which improved with decompression.  Tube feedings
were maintained for nutrition.  Her urine output was normal with
a normal creatinine.  She did have a large amount subcutaneous
emphysema, which was lessened somewhat with chest tube suction
on the right side.

By POD 5, she was still unable to wean off the ventilator.
Despite other organ systems being stable, she decided, after
multiple conversations with the housestaff, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and the ICU
team, that she did not want to continue on a respirator and did
not want a tracheostomy if there was little hope of improving to
the point of weaning off ventilatory support.

After conversation to this effect, she decided that she wanted
to be extubated and made Comfort Measures Only.  This was done
in the afternoon of [**5-21**].  She expired shortly thereafter.
