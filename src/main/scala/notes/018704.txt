CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm and right common
iliac artery aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old
nondiabetic white male with hypertension, chronic low back
pain secondary to spinal stenosis, who complained of
increased lower back pain since [**2181-3-6**].  The patient was
evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon with an MRI that showed an
abdominal aortic aneurysm.

The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further
evaluation.  The patient underwent an outpatient arteriogram
on [**2181-5-10**] that showed an 8 cm AAA, and a 3.5 cm right
common iliac artery aneurysm.  The patient was evaluated for
a stent graft placement but he was not a suitable candidate.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Herpes zoster of the right trigeminal nerve.
3. Bacterial meningitis.
4. Increased intraocular pressure.
5. Spinal stenosis.
6. Right sciatica.
7. Degenerative joint disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Carpal tunnel release.
2. Left total knee replacement.
3. Right total hip replacement in [**2180-11-5**] in [**Doctor Last Name 26532**].

ALLERGIES:
1. Percodan causes hallucinations.
2. Vicodin causes a rash.
3. Benadryl causes hives.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. b.i.d.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired electrical
engineer.  He stopped smoking cigarettes 30 years ago.  He
drinks two to three alcoholic drinks per day.  He lives with
his wife.  His daughter and son-in-law live next door.
Currently he ambulates with a cane.  He is physically active
golfing and drives his car without difficulty.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Pulse 87, respiratory
rate 21, blood pressure 145/60, O2 saturation equals 98% on
room air.  General:  Alert, cooperative white male in no
acute distress.  HEENT:  Normocephalic.  Pupils were equal,

Range of motion within normal limits.  No lymphadenopathy.
Chest:  Heart regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Lungs
clear bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft.  Nontender.  Bowel sounds
present.  Aorta palpable.  Rectal:  Examination deferred.
Extremities:  Arthritic changes present.  Pulse examination:
Carotid, radial, femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis pulses
were all 2+ bilaterally.  Posterior tibial pulses were 1+
bilaterally.  Neurological:  Examination was not focal.  The
patient was alert and oriented x 3.

LABORATORY DATA:  On [**2181-5-11**] white blood cell count was 7.8,
hemoglobin 12.1, hematocrit 34.6, platelet count 173,000,
sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 105, bicarbonate 24, BUN
15, creatinine 1.0, glucose 96.  EKG on [**2181-5-25**] showed a
sinus rhythm with a rate of 67.  Borderline intraventricular
conduction delay.  Compared to previous tracing of [**2181-5-10**],
sinus rate faster and sinus bradycardia no longer present.
Chest x-ray on [**2181-5-25**] showed emphysema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2181-5-30**] following AAA and right common iliac artery aneurysm
resection with an aortobi-iliac bypass graft.  At the end of
surgery the patient had equally warm feet with Doppler
signals of the dorsalis pedis arteries bilaterally.  He was
given Kefzol perioperatively.  He was transfused two units of
packed red blood cells immediately postoperatively.

The patient's postoperative course was complicated.  Shortly
after surgery he developed episodes of bradycardia to a rate
of 30 to 40 with associated hypotension.  Cardiology was
consulted.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was done that
was negative.  The patient was transferred to the surgical
intensive care unit on a dopamine drip.  Heparin was removed
from all of his lines after platelets drifted down from
136,000 to 95,000.  He was given Ativan 1 mg IV q. 6 hours
for ethanol withdrawal prophylaxis.  Fentanyl was given
p.r.n.  A nasogastric tube was kept in place and IV Protonix
was ordered.  Anesthesia capped his epidural catheter.

The electrophysiology service was consulted.  The patient's
heart rate was in the 70s after the dopamine drip was weaned
off.  No further immediate treatment was necessary.  The
following day the patient had a VT arrest x 2.  He was
cardioverted successfully twice.  Beta blocker was started.
Amiodarone and propofol drips were started following the
second VT arrest.  The patient was transfused packed red
blood cells to keep his hematocrit greater than 30.  The
amiodarone drip was stopped after two days.

The patient was weaned off of his IV Ativan for alcohol
withdrawal prophylaxis.  Diuresis was continued.  On
postoperative day number seven the patient had a fever spike
to 101.2.  Vancomycin was added to the levofloxacin already
on board.  The following day the patient spiked to 104.1.
Sputum, blood and urine cultures were sent.  Flagyl was added
to the vancomycin and levofloxacin.  General surgery was
consulted to evaluate for possible intra-abdominal process.
They felt there was more likely a septic process going on.
The infectious disease service was consulted.  They
recommended stopping the vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Zosyn 4.5 grams IV q. 6 hours was ordered.  Blood cultures
grew E. coli.  Sputum grew Proteus.  Urine culture grew E.
coli and 10 to 100,000 Enterococcus.  Vancomycin was
continued to cover the Enterococcus.  Lines were changed.
Blood cultures were repeated.  A chest x-ray showed right
lower lobe pneumonia.

The patient failed extubation on postoperative day number
eight.  He was finally extubated on postoperative day number
10.  Vancomycin was stopped.  Aggressive pulmonary toilet was
ordered.  Dilaudid subcutaneous was given for incisional
pain.  The nasogastric tube had over 400 cc of guaiac
positive fluid.  This was felt to be old postoperative blood.
The patient was continued on IV Protonix.

Infectious disease recommended changing the IV Zosyn to
ceftriaxone for a combined total of 14 days.  This was to be
followed by two to four weeks of oral antibiotics.  The
patient was started on levofloxacin on [**2181-6-19**] and will be
stopped on [**2181-7-4**].

On [**2181-6-12**] a bedside swallow study showed that the patient
had a nonfunctioning swallow.  A nasogastric tube was
continued.  The patient had had a Dobbhoff placed on [**2181-6-8**]
to initiate tube feedings when the catheter was postpyloric.

The patient was transferred to the VICU on [**2181-6-12**].  A video
swallow study was attempted on [**2181-6-13**] but was not possible
because the patient could not follow commands.  He continued
to be confused, sometimes combative, and required a sitter.

The electrophysiology service was consulted again regarding
the placement of an AICD.  The EPS agreed to place the device
after a total of two weeks of antibiotic therapy.  A right
PICC line was placed for TPN and intravenous antibiotic
therapy.  However the patient pulled out the PICC line five
days after placement.  This was not replaced.  Video swallow
done on [**2181-6-18**] showed a normal swallow, no aspiration, but
decreased pharyngeal sensitivity.  The patient was able to
tolerate a soft diet with Boost t.i.d. with meals.
Aspiration precautions were followed.

Repeat blood cultures were negative.  An AICD via the left
cephalic vessel was placed on [**2181-6-11**].  Three days of
vancomycin were ordered post device placement.  The patient
had been scheduled to follow up in one week in the device
clinic, but since the patient remained hospitalized, the EPS
fellow interrogated the AICD at the bedside on [**2181-6-28**].
Follow up in the electrophysiology cardiology clinic in one
to three months was recommended.

The patient continued to have periods of agitation,
confusion, and combativeness.  He required a sitter for
several evenings to prevent him from climbing out of his
Posey and bed.  These episodes primarily occurred in the
early morning hours.  He also reported seeing things on the
walls in the bathroom.  The patient was screened for
rehabilitation but could not be accepted while the patient
