Service: CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY     Date:  [**2165-1-10**]


Surgeon:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 275**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1539**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 1540**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year old gentleman
with   a   long   history   of   tobacco  use,  hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia  in  family  history  until  about eight
months  ago  when  he noticed the requirement of needing more
frequent  sublingual nitroglycerin for increasing chest pain.
At  1:00  a.m.  on  [**10-2**],  while  at  rest in bed, he
developed   substernal  chest  pain  radiating  to  his  left
shoulder  with  shortness of breath.  He took four sublingual
nitroglycerins  with minimal relief.  The pain kept him awake
throughout   the   night.     At  6:00  a.m.  he  took  eight
nitroglycerins  without  relief  and also tried his albuterol
inhaler.    He  called  his  daughter  and  she activated the
emergency  system  and  he  was brought to [**Hospital3 **] at
9:00 a.m.

At  [**Hospital3 **], his electrocardiogram showed anterior ST
elevations  with  lateral  T-wall  inversions  and reciprocal
inferior  ST  depressions.  He  was  given  aspirin, heparin,
Aggrastat,  and  nitroglycerin.    He was transferred to [**Hospital1 43634**].   At [**Hospital6 43635**],    he    underwent    emergent    cardiac
catheterization, results to follow.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Angina.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Aortic stenosis.
5.  Asthma.
6.    Peptic  ulcer disease, status post gastrectomy 30 years
ago.
7.    Colon  cancer,  status  post  colectomy  with radiation
therapy 4 years ago.
8.    Peripheral  vascular  disease with history of bilateral
lower extremity claudication.

ALLERGIES:  None known.

MEDICATIONS  ON  ADMISSION:    Albuterol,  aspirin,  Norvasc,
isosorbide     dinitrate,     lovastatin    and    sublingual
nitroglycerin.

FAMILY  HISTORY:   He had a strong family history of coronary
artery   disease   including  myocardial  infarction  in  one
brother.

SOCIAL  HISTORY:   He had a smoking history of 20 pack years,
but  he  quit  30  years ago. He was somewhat active, walking
about an hour a day.

LABORATORY  DATA  ON ADMISSION:  White count 12.1. Hematocrit
34.5.    Platelet  count  242.  Sodium 141.  K 4.2.  Chloride
111.    CO2  14.  BUN 29.  Creatinine 1.4 with blood sugar of
169.    His  CKs were in the 230 to 1244 range with MBs of 25
and  180  which  indexed  to 10.9 and 16.5, ruling him in for
myocardial infarction.

HOSPITAL  COURSE:  At cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital3 **],
he  had  elevated  filling  pressures  with  an 80% posterior
descending   artery   lesion,   a  left  main  left  anterior
descending  95%  lesion,  and  diffusely diseased diagonal 1.
They  did  place  a  stent  in  the  left  main proximal left
anterior  descending  lesion  and  a  balloon  was placed and
patient  was  transferred  into  the  CCU.  He was started on
Plavix, heparin, Aggrastat, and captopril and he was referred
to cardiothoracic surgery.

He  was  seen  by  Dr.  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 71**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 72**] from cardiac surgery for
evaluation  in  this  acute myocardial infarction period.  On
his  exam,  his  pressure was 110/52 with a heart rate of 80.
His  head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam was negative.  He
had  no  carotid bruits.  He had a systolic injection murmur.
His  lungs  had  crackles on the right side.  He had a healed
median  infraumbilical  scar  and no masses.  His abdomen was
soft  and  nontender.   He had an intraaortic balloon pump in
place  in his right groin.  His distal pulses were present on
Doppler.

His  chest  x-ray showed some pulmonary edema.  His blood gas
that  day  was  7.41/98/30/20  with a base excess of -3.  His
white  count had dropped to 9.4, with a hematocrit of 30, a K
of 3.8, a BUN of 30 and creatinine of 1.5.  He appeared to be
still   evolving   his   myocardial  infarction.    His  left
ventricular  end-diastolic  pressure  was  40  with pulmonary
artery  pressures  of  58/42.   His ejection fraction was 20%
with  an  aortic  valve  area  of  0.9  cm  squared. The mean
gradient  of  14  at  a  peak  of  23  as well as a calcified
ascending  aorta.    All  of  these results were found on his
echocardiogram   which   confirmed  the  presence  of  aortic
stenosis and myocardial dysfunction.

He continued to be stabilized in the CCU over the next couple
of days for his evolving myocardial infarction.   He had a CT
scan  of  the chest which showed some midcalcification of the
ascending    aorta    most    prominently    anteriorly   and
calcifications  near  the  aortic  valve.    It  also  showed
moderate  bilateral pleural effusions with some loculation on
the  left  and  probable  asbestosis.  Please refer to the CT
chest  report.    He  was  seen  by  clinical nutrition as he
awaited  surgery  with  the  balloon  pump  in  the  CCU.  He
received  a  Swan-Ganz  in the CCU as his medical issues were
addressed.

On [**10-8**] he underwent aortic valve replacement with a
20  mm  [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] bioprosthetic valve and a coronary
artery  bypass  grafting times 4 with a left internal mammary
artery  to  the left anterior descending, a vein graft to the
posterolateral  sequential  to  the  ramus intermedius, and a
vein  graft to the posterior descending artery by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].    He  was  transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit in stable condition on a Levophed drip at 0.05 mics
per  kg  per  minute, a milrinone drip at 0.5 mics per kg per
minute and a propofol drip at 30 mics per kg per minute.

On  his  first  postoperative  day,  he  had  decreased urine
output.  He received fluid and Lasix with a minimal response.
His creatinine rose to 1.8, his hematocrit was 30 and a white
count  of  8.7.    His  lactate  was 1.6.  He remained on the
balloon  pump.    Intubated  on Levophed, insulin, milrinone,
Neo-Synephrine  and  propofol.  His intra-aortic balloon pump
was  removed  on  the afternoon of the second day.  Renal was
asked  to see the patient who determined that he was probably
in  acute renal failure from several factors, being prerenal,
intrarenal with the possibility of interstitial nephritis and
probable acute tubular necrosis.  This was discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1537**].          Their     recommendations    were    followed.

Over  the  course  of  the next several days, the patient was
seen by physical therapy.  He continued to have problems with
urine   output.     On  his  second  postoperative  day,  his
creatinine rose to 2.3 with a rising white count of 14.9.  He
remained  intubated  and  sedated  with  a  blood pressure of
100/50  and a T-max of 99.1 on dopamine, Levophed, milrinone,
Neo-Synephrine  and propofol.  He was also seen by a vascular
surgeon  because,  after  his balloon removal that afternoon,
there was a question of whether or not he lost his pulse.  He
did  have a slightly cool left foot with some mottling of the
toes,  with  with  the  possibility  of having showered small
emboli  to  the  vessels in the left foot during placement or
removal  of  the  balloon.  This was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]   of  vascular  surgery  with  the  recommendation  to
anticoagulate him, and he remained on the heparin drip.

He was followed every day by vascular.  He was seen by renal.
He  continued to have slight improvement in his urine output.
He  did  remain intubated but was following commands.  He was
on continuous positive airway pressure on postoperative day 3
remaining again on his inotropic and pressor support.  He was
seen again by nutrition.

The patient was extubated on the 13th.  The   milrinone   was
off,  the  Neo-Synephrine was off.  There were some casts and
sediment with white blood cells in his urine.  Amiodarone had
been  added  in.    He was being paced in the 88 to 118 range
with  the  blood  pressure  ranging from 80/42 to 137/66.  He
remained  extubated.   His heparin was turned off.  His white
count was 11.0 on postoper
