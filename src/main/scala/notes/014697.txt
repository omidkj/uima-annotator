Dyspnea

History of Present Illness:
The patient's history was primarily reconstructed from reports
from [**Hospital3 **] and OMR, since she arrived in
extremis. The patient has a history of COPD, CHF, atrial
fibrillation (refuses anticoagulation), history of colon cancer,
and recurrent pneumonias.  The patient had been experiencing 24
hours of worsening acute repiratory distress. The patient
further experienced fever, chills, and a cough productive of
sputum. Her oxygen saturations dropped into the high 60s, so the
rehab facility did bag breathing for her overnight.
.
In the ED, the patient arrived tachypneic to the 40s, using her
accessory muscles,and saturating in the 80s. Her EKG evidently
showed sinus tachycardia. A chest X-ray demonstrated complete
opacification of the left lung. The patient had appropriate
mental status to be asked her code status; she agreed to be
intubated. The patient then nderwent rapid sequence intubation
successfully, then was sedated with propofol. During her stay in
the ED, the patient spiked a fever to 101.4; because of her
already suspected pneumonia, she was started on vancomycin,
cefepime, azithromycin. The patient has an operational power
PICC and peripheral in place for access. Her vital signs were HR
89 RR 23 stauration of 97% (ventilator settings not known), BP
101/59.

Past Medical History:
1) Diastolic congestive heart failure (NYHA class IV)
2) Atrial fibrillation (refuses coumadin)
3) Symptomatic bradycardia status post VDD pacemaker in [**11/2143**]
4) Obstructive sleep apnea (on CPAP at 8-10 cm of H2O)
5) Coronary artery disease
6) Hyperlipidemia
7) Hypertension
8) Colon cancer s/p resection
9) COPD (on O2 2-4 liters at home)
10) Bronchiectasis
11) GERD
12) Pulmonary hypertension
13) Anemia
14) Pneumonia ([**2145**])
15) Acute respiratory failure in [**3-/2144**] and again in [**3-/2145**]
16) History of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in
her
sputum following hernia repair and again in [**3-/2145**] with
documented pneumonia
.

1) Status post hernia repair.
2) Status post appendectomy.
3) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
4) Status post back surgery.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2152-9-2**]**

   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2152-9-2**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other
L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may
vary.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

IMAGING:
[**2152-9-1**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Severely limited examination secondary
to motion. Complete opacification of the visualized left
hemithorax with associated leftward mediastinal shift most
compatible with left lung collapse with possible effusion.

[**2152-9-1**] CXR (after bronch) - ETT ends 1.2 cm above the carina and
could be retracted by 1-2cm. There is improved aeration in the
left upper lobe post-bronchoscopy. Extensive parenchymal
opacities and left basal opacification persist.

[**2152-9-3**] R HIP - Again noted is severe osteoarthritis with marked
narrowing of the joint space with subchondral cyst formation,
sclerosis, and spurring. On this limited study, I see no
evidence of fracture or dislocation. Distal femoral internal
fixation rod is noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 84-year-old woman with a history of COPD,
bronchiectasis, obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension,
and diastolic congestive heart failure admitted to the MICU with
respiratory failure requiring intubation for mucous plugging and
pneumonia.

# Respiratory failure: The patient was admitted in respiratory
distress and intubated.  Based on imaging, the patient has a
pneumonia with mucus plugging that took away function of her
left lung.  She was started on vancomycin and cefepime, with
added azithromycin for atypicals.  The patient underwent
bronchoscopy on day of admission with s
