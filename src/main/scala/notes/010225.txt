Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 158**]
Chief Complaint:
rectal cancer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Attempted transanal endoscopic microsurgery
(TEM), proctectomy, end-colostomy with mobilization of
splenic flexure.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65yo male with a rectal mass that had
appearance of a sizeable rectal cancer.  His biopsy showed just
an adenoma.  His previous biopsy was complicated by significant
bleeding.  We did
check the CEA, which was slightly elevated at 4.9.  We did an
MRI of the pelvis which most of the time tend to be one of the
best studies which we can get, however, in his case because of
absence
of any fat in his body, it was really not diagnostic.  He
underwent an ultrasound today which was also very difficult, but
showed may be a T2 lesion at best but some areas cannot be
really well evaluated.  He is complaining of some phlegm and
some coughing that has been persistent and he is going to get an
x-ray at your office tomorrow.  Otherwise, he has been in the
same health.  He has occasional abdominal cramping and he is
having some diarrhea.  He occasionally passes some blood.  He
has been
trying to eat, but unable to gain much weight. He presents for
surgical staging with TEM.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent attempted transanal microsurgical excision
of his tumor which was unsuccessful. He was converted to
proctectomy with end colostomy. Due to his many medical
comorbidities he was transferred to the ICU post-operatively. He
was closely monitored and did well overall. His urine output was
low and required multiple fluid boluses to support. He was
extubated and had good oxygen saturations on 2-3L NC and was
slowly weaned off of oxygen.

On POD#1 he was transferred from the ICU to a regular floor bed.
He was monitored closely on telemetry. His blood pressure was
elevated in the 190s and his home atenolol and lisinopril were
restarted and his BP decreased appropriately. His
anticoagulation was held. The vascular surgery service saw the
patient and evaluated his R femoral to peroneal bypass and felt
it was stable and recommended outpatient follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1391**]. The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal and
was monitored on a CIWA scale. He did not require any ativan or
valium for withdrawal. He was also given thiamine.

On POD#2 he had gas in his ostomy bag and his diet was advanced
to clears. His foley catheter was removed but he failed to void
and it was replaced. He was started on flomax.

On POD#3 peripheral IV access was obtained and his right IJ
central line was removed. His stoma continued to have gas but no
output, and he was given a dulcolax suppository to his stoma
without effect. He was also given milk of magnesia.

On the remaining post-operative days his ostomy began putting
out an appropriate amount of stool and gas. He was restarted on
his home medications and the reglan was discontinued. He was
tolerating a regular diet and voiding. He worked with PT who
recommended home with home PT. His family came in and underwent
teaching regarding his care at home. He was discharged home and
will follow-up in colorectal surgery clinic.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after proctectomy and end
colostomy for surgical management of your rectal cancer. Samples
from your colon were taken and this tissue has been sent to the
pathology department for analysis. You will receive these
pathology results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an
urgent need for the surgeon to contact you [**Name2 (NI) 19605**] these
results they will contact you before this time. You have
tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is
controlled with pain medications by mouth.

 If you have any of the following symptoms please call the
office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe:
increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids.

You have an incision that can be left open to air or covered
with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the staples become
irritated from clothing. The staples will stay in place until
your first post-operative visit at which time they can be
removed in the clinic, most likely by the office nurse. Please
monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection
including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the
incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a
fever. Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe.  You may
shower, let the warm water run over the incision
