Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC Line placement

History of Present Illness:
86 year old woman with history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, rheumatoid
arthritis, COPD, DM2 presenting with hypoxia and hypotension.
The patient was referred in the [**Hospital1 18**] after developing new onset
shortness of breath at her [**Hospital1 1501**].  She was found to be very
congested and non-productive cough. O2sat was found to be 83% RA
with improvement to 96% on 2L.  Vitals were 98.1  79  82/52 22
and fingerstick was 116. She received albuterol and atrovent
prior to transfer.

Of note she was just discharged on [**2149-4-29**] from [**Hospital1 18**] following
an admission for RLL pneumonia.  She was discharged to complete
a 10 day course of vancomycin/cefepime via a PICC line. At the
[**Hospital1 1501**] she was feeling improved with increasing energy and
participating in her activities of bingo and other social
gatherings.

In the ED her initial vitals were 101.2 86 88/40  21 99% NRB.
Her CXR was notable for persistent opacities in the RLL with
worsening pulmonary edema.  She was hypoxic with response to NRB
then titrate down to venti-mask. Her blood pressure initially
was in the 90s then trended down requiring levophed infusion via
her PICC line. She received 1.5L of NS. Lactate remained normal.
She received vanc/zosyn.

CXR [**5-1**]
---------
FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled "upright" with
lordotic positioning is compared with recent examinations dated
[**4-25**] and [**2149-4-23**]. The patient is status post median sternotomy
and CABG with six intact sternal cerclage wires, as before.
There is cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion,
interstitial edema and bilateral pleural effusions, representing
CHF, worse since [**4-23**]. There is persistent focal airspace
opacity involving the right lung base, also more confluent over
the series of studies, likely representing pneumonic
consolidation; no new airspace process is seen elsewhere. There
has been interval placement of a right subclavian PICC with its
tip in the proximal SVC. Atherosclerotic changes involving the
thoracic aorta are redemonstrated.

IMPRESSION:

1. Persistent confluent airspace process involving the right
lung base, likely representing pneumonic consolidation.

2. CHF with interstitial edema and bilateral pleural effusions,
worse since [**4-23**].

Brief Hospital Course:
86 year old woman with hx of CAD s/p CABG, biventricular CHF,
COPD, DM2 who presented with acute hypoxia and hypotension.

Hypoxia secondary to Aspiration Pneumonia: Likely multifactorial
with residual pneumonia +/- additional aspiration with
co-incident pulmonary edema (potentially capillary leak from
UTI). Patient presented on day 8 of 10 of health-care associated
pneumonia therapy. In the ICU, the patient's vanc/cefepime
outpatient tx was changed to vanco/zosyn for HAP.  She received
seven additional days of IV abx as an inpatient here.  Her
oxygen requirement improved throughout her stay.  Speech/swallow
evaluation consisitent with moderate dysphagia.  Family does not
wish to pursue restricted diet or PEG placement (see below for
hospice/comfort measures discussion).

Hypotension: ICU team thought likely related to infection in
patient with poor cardiac reserve (biV dysfunction). After
speaking with the family, it was realized that the patient's two
arms had significant differences in her BP.  Her right arm BP is
significantly higher, and more consistent with the BP in her
cuff.  She was weaned off pressors and did not require any
further pressors or fluid boluses.  At the time of discharge
from the ICU, the patient was hemodynamically stable.  Her HCT
remained stable.

Delirium:  After transfer to the floor, the patient was noted to
be muttering that she was very frightened repeatedly and refused
to interact with her famil;y or medical staff.  The following
day, she was more interactive but not verbal.  Psychiatry
evaluated the patient and was concerned for delirium versus
catatonia.  The patient was deemed not to have capacity at that
tiem and per the strong wishes of her HCP, the patient's code
status was changed to DNR/DNI on [**2149-5-4**].  Her mental status
improved throughout her stay, although she remained
intermittently disoriented/delerious.

Anemia: Normocytic anemia with elevated RDW but with no evidence
of acute blood loss or hemolysis. Her HCT remained stable.

COPD: stable; continued bronchodilators.

Biventricular ischem
