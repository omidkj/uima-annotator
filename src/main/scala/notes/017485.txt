History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 71-year-old gentleman who had a previous
coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic and mitral valve
replacements done approximately 2 years ago. The patient came
into the hospital approximately 4 weeks ago
with infected pacemaker which was removed but a piece was
retained in the subclavian vein to internal jugular
vein/superior vena cava complex which required median sternotomy
to obtain proximal and distal control to remove.
Initially he was known to have mitral valve endocarditis but the
valve was well-seated and there was no involvement of the aortic
valve and the plan was to treat him medically for his prosthetic
valve endocarditis.  The patient was recently readmitted to the
hospital approximately a week ago with recurrent fevers and new
transesophageal echo showed aortic root abscess, partial
dehiscence of the aortic valve and the preexisting mitral valve
vegetations.  We felt the patient needed to proceed with surgery
at this point in time.

[**2126-10-2**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed native 3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LM had 50%
stenosis. The LAD has 90% mid stenosis. The LCx has 40-50% mid
stenosis. The RCA had 80% mid stenosis.
2. Selective arterial conduit angiography revealed patent LIMA
to LAD. Selective venous conduit angiography revealed patent SVG
to OMB and SVG to PDA. The SVG to diagonal was patent with 60%
mid diagonal lesion.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial pressure of 113/52mmHg.

[**2126-10-4**] [**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT - TEE
Prebypass:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is higher than
expected for this type of prosthesis. There is a moderate-sized
vegetation on the aortic valve. An aortic annular abscess is
seen. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic
mitral valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic mitral valve
leaflets are thickened. The gradients are higher than expected
for this type of prosthesis. There is a moderate-sized
vegetation on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
Post bypass:
Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of epinephrine,
norepinephrine and vasopresssin. Biventricular systolic function
is unchanged.
Bioprosthetic valve seen in the mitral position. The valve
appears well seated.The mean gradient is 9 mm Hg with a cardiac
output of 5.6 litres/minute. There is no mitral regurgitation.
Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. The valve
appears well seated. The mean gradient is 28 mm Hg in the
setting of a cardiac output of 5.6 litres/minute. There is no
aortic insufficiency.
.
[**2126-11-7**] [**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT - TEE
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with borderline normal free wall function. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta to 30 cm from
the incisors. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move
normally. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. Cannot rule out aortic abscess
however, the peri-valvular tissue appears inflamed. A
bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. Motion of the
mitral annulus is abnormal and suggestive of partial dehiscence.
A paravalvular mitral prosthesis leak is probably present along
the posterior aspect of the mitral valve. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2126-11-8**] Abdominal Ultrasound:
Current examination is highly limited by a midline dressing over
the abdomen and two right-sided chest tubes. The liver to the
limited extent visualized, demonstrates no focal or textural
abnormality. There is no biliary dilatation. The common duct is
3 mm. The portal vein demonstrates no occlusive thrombus,
