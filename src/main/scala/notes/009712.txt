History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82M with DM, CRI, and COPD who presents with
abdominal pain x 4 days. The pain began after he returned home
from a golf outing. He ate a roast beef [**Location (un) 6002**] and some pizza
and later developed pain that he describes it as sudden in
onset, "like someone was punching him in the stomach,"
unrelenting but worsening over time. He had nausea and one
episode of non-bloody emesis. Appetite has been poor. He has not
moved his bowels since the pain began, no rectal bleeding. He
also reports no fevers, chills, or sweats. He took ibuprofen and
acetaminophen with incomplete relief. He also tried a couple of
oxycontin pills he had from an expired prescription, again with
incomplete relief. He denies having similar pain before, though
one month prior did have several hours of right chest/RUQ
discomfort that resolved spontaneously.
.
In the ED, initial vs were 97.5 59 146/129 23 97% on RA.
Admission labs were notable for WBC 19k, lipase of 4k,
transaminitis in 100's with total bilirubin of 4.7 and acute on
chronic renal failure with Cr of 3.4. Abdomen distended on exam
but no peritoneal signs; reported epigastric tenderness to
palpation, no [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign. He was given a total of 10mg of IV
morphine, 1g calcium, and 500mg of levofloxacin and 500mg
flagyl. Got 2.5L of saline. EKG showed a LBBB, new from [**2150**].
RUQ ultrasound was notable for CBD dilatation to 7-9mm, without
a CBD stone seen. His abdominal CT showed inflammatory stranding
around the pancreas. He was seen by the surgical and GI consult
services who recommended ERCP. Last vitals 61 140/63 96% on 2L.
.
On evaluation in the ICU, he reports continued abdominal
discomfort at 5/10. He reports a mild chronic cough and
postnasal drip and feels that his breathing is at his baseline.
He does endorse rare episodes of chest pressure or increased
dyspnea when climbing a [**Doctor Last Name **] on the golf course, last one week
ago but denies prior MI. Denies any chest discomfort currently.
No known liver or pancreatic disease. His urine looked a little
darker at home but he did not notice any jaundice. Review of
systems is otherwise negative.

Imaging:
[**2153-9-15**] EKG: Sinus brady @57, nl axis, 1st degree HB and LBBB,
the latter of which are new compared to [**2150-11-17**] EKG
.
[**2153-9-15**] RUQ U/S:
1. Diffusely echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.

2. Common bile duct at the upper limits of normal. No
intrahepatic ductal
dilation.
3. No gallstones. A small amount of pericholecystic fluid is
likely reactive due to the acute pancreatitis described on CT.
4. Right renal cyst.
.
[**2153-9-15**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis w/o contrast:
1. Findings compatible with acute pancreatitis.
2. Diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.
3. Endovascular aortic stent, stable in position with reduction
in size of
infrarenal AAA.
4. Fatty infiltration of the liver.
.
[**2153-9-21**] LENI's: negative for DVT
.
[**2153-9-21**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis: Final read pending
.
[**2153-9-16**] ERCP:
Erythema and congestion in the area of the papilla, c/w acute
pancreatitis.
Stones and sludge in bile duct.
A partial sphincterotomy was performed. Stone retained
Copious amount of sludge and pus was noted.
A biliary stent was placed.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
.
[**2153-9-20**] ERCP:
Multiple erosions in stomach probably due to NG trauma
Severe edema of the duodenum
Old plastic stent removed
Sludge extraction using balloon catheter
New biliary stent placed
Repeat ERCP in 8 weeks for stent pull
.
Chest X-Ray: AP view: [**2153-11-14**]
The tracheostomy is in place, the tip of the tracheostomy is
approximately 7 cm above the carina. The extensive bilateral
consolidations involve the
entire lung, and accompanied by bilateral pleural effusions are
unchanged with the left pleural effusion being larger than the
right. Note is made that the lung bases were only partially
included in the field of view.
