Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
70 year old male with altered mental status was brought to [**Hospital1 18**]
by EMS. Patient has no identification and is unable to
communicate his name or other historical information.
.
In the ED, initial vitals Temp:96.1 HR:120 BP:150/64 Resp:20,
Sat:96. Patient altered, agitated, initally given haldol 5mg IM
x one. EKG with sinus tach, RBBB with lateral ST depressions. CT
head/C-spine within normal limits. Knee and Left Hand plain
films without fracture. Initial labs with anion gap acidosis,
elevated lactate, and EtOH of 17. Given patient's presentation
with mild elevation in EtOH and significantly elevated lactate
ED beleieved patient may have had an EtOH withdrawal seizure. Pt
MS cleared enough to have conversation and C-spine cleared
clinically, however name/ID was not discovered. Neuro was
consulted with concern for EtOH withdrawal seizure and AMS
however they could not get exam as pt became more agitated.
Patient was intubated for airway protection and to facilitate LP
- sedated on propofol. LP attempted by resident and attg and was
unsucessful. Patient started on vanco/ctx, ampicillin,
dexamethasone, acyclovir (given at approx 2300) for empriric
meningitis coverage. Further, CT Torso performed to eval for
intra abd infection/ischemia, read is pending as of transfer.
During ED course patient was also given Banana Bag/3 liters of
NS and Tetatnus vaccination. Prior to transfer HR 85, BP 140/50,
98% on AC, Fi02 100%.

Studies:
EEG Study Date of [**2145-11-10**]
IMPRESSION: This is a normal routine EEG study. No focal,
lateralized
or epileptiform findings were seen.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2145-11-3**] 6:31 PM
IMPRESSION: No acute traumatic injuries. Chronic microvascular
ischemic
disease. Paranasal sinus fluid.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2145-11-3**] 6:32 PM
IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment in the cervical spine.

degenerative disease.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2145-11-4**] 12:13 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar consolidation could represent aspiration/pneumonia.

2. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
3. Aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring up to
3.9 cm.
4. Right-sided herniation of lung tissue, liver and loops of
small bowel
between the ninth and tenth right posterolateral ribs, likely
chronic.
5. NG tube terminating in upper esophagus. Needs repositioning.

previously done.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2145-11-4**] at 10:15:00 AM
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0 cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo male with AMS. Unclear history. In ED mental status wax
and waned and patient was found to be febrile with elevated
lactate and EtOH level. Eventually patient was intubated for
airway protection and to facilitate lumbar puncture.
.
1. Altered Mental Status: Intubated in the ED for airway
protection. Likely secondary to EtoH withdrawal and seizure
given elevated lactic acid and incontinence. Initially patient
started on antiobiotics/antivirals with concern for meningitis
after spiking a temperature in the emergency department. LP was
performed on the floor and revealed no evidenc of meningitis.
HSV PCR was negative and meningitis coverage was stopped.
Patient was given IV thiamine in the setting of possible
thiamine deficiency at 200mg IV three times daily for two days
then 100mg IV daily. On HD #1 patient was extubated and
treatment was continued for EtoH withdrawal with diazepam. On HD
#2 it was felt that patient was intoxicated so diazepam was
stopped and patient was allowed to self taper with gradual
improvement in his mental status.  B12, Folate, TSH, RPR were
all normal or negative.  His mental status cleared, and he was
transitioned to the general medical floor. He was fully awake
and oriented, and able to relay his history, though he did not
know what had happened surrounding the events of the fall prior
to admission.
.
2. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Secondary to lactic acidosis.
No osmolar gap to suggest other ingestion. Resolved with IVF and
clearance of lactic acid.
.
3. Fever: Temperature to 101 during ED course. LP without
evidence of meningitis. UA negative. CXR/CT chest with concern
for CAP. Which was treated as noted below.
.
4. Holosystolic Murmur: Severe Aortic Stenosis on ECHO.
.
5. Intubation:  Patient intubated in the setting of altered
mental status for airway protection. Patient extubated on first
hospital day.
.
6. Mild Troponin Elevation/EKG changes: On admission patient wil
mild elevation in Troponin in the setting of normal renal
function which trended down over the following 24 hours. Initial
EKG revealed RBBB and LAFB without concern for ST segment
elevation. On the morning of his first hospital day patient
became hypotensive in the setting of sedation with propofol and
