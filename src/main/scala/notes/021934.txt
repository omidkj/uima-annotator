Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Coagulase-negative staph bacteremia complicated by vegetation on
ICD line, pericardial effusion c/b tamponade

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD removal
Endotracheal placement and removal
Tracheostomy
Electrophysiology study


History of Present Illness:
54 yr/o M with Hx of DM, HTN, CKD, CHF (last EF 40-45%), MI s/p
3 stents ([**11/2153**]), Afib (on warfarin and s/p ablation), with
ICD placed in [**2151**] who presented to [**Hospital3 **] (OSH) on
[**8-21**] with sudden onset of chest pain that had started on [**8-20**] and
was accompanied by fever and chills but which had resolved by
arrival at OSH and that had been preceeded by 5 day history of
malaise. Also had a productive cough at presentation which is
near home baseline. He says cough is due to sinusitis. Presening
WBC 12.9, Hgb 7.4, Plts 23. Cr 1.6-1.8 with albumin 2.8 and INR
2.9 - cardiac enzymes ruled out. Initially was transfused 3
units of blood for anemia. At OSH pt was apparently diagnosed
with an ICD vegetation with multiple blood cultures growing Coag
Neg Staph ([**4-21**] on day 1, [**2-21**] on day 3, [**1-21**] on day 5 per micro
tech). He was started on Vancomycin on [**2155-8-21**] and also received
4 days of levofloxacin. He developed pericardial tamponade and
had a pericardiocentesis yesterday with drainage of 500cc bloody
fluid. A pericardial drain was placed and drained 200cc since
placement but was removed late this AM. He received a TEE with
etomidate sedation 1 hour prior to transfer and after [**Last Name (un) **]
proceedure was SOB and placed on a 50% venti-mask. He also went
into Afib/flutter with RVR to the 130-140s after the TEE and was
given 15mg total IV metoprolol with BP at 108/70 prior to
transfer. He also has a left pleural effusion which had
developed during stay. Immediately before transfer he received
another ECHO to ruleout reaccumulation of pericardial fluid as
he had become more tachypnic and had low BPs. At time of
transfer pt was on no drips, was not intubated, and was not
requiring pressors.

Patient reports that he had been getting dyspnic with little
exertion the few days prior to arrival at OSH. Currently walks
with a cain and has low exercise tolerance. Chest pain has
subsided and patient does not feel he is having palpitations.

Past Medical History:

Discharge Physical Exam:
GENERAL: Awake, responsive, and conversant. Fully oriented and
converses appropriately, although difficult to understand at
times.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. Pupils small but symmetric and
react slightly, EOMI appear intact. Poor dentition but otherwise
OP clear.
NECK: Supple without significant JVP elevation
CARDIAC: RR, soft S1, S2. difficult to assess for murmurs due to
faint HS
LUNGS: Mildly decreased BS, mostly decreased at left base.
ABDOMEN: Soft, distended [**2-19**] to habitus, No tenderness apparent.

EXTREMITIES: Mild trace edema throughout.

Pertinent Results:
Outside Hospital Studies:
- TEE ([**8-29**]): Dense structure attached to ICD lead, normal LV/RV
structure and fucntion, no evidence of pericardial effusion,
left pleural effusion
- TTE ([**8-25**]): Moderate pericardial effusion with tamponade
physiology, abnormal septal motion with diastolic collapse,
mildly dilated [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
- [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] Stress ([**2-28**]): No report but OSH HPI mentions
reversible ischemia, apex EF 55%, hypokinetic apex
-CXR Pa/Lat ([**8-21**]): No acute process
-Chest CT ([**8-22**]): Small pericardial effusion, mediastinal LNs up
to 1.3cm, trace left pleural effusion with subsegmental
opacities
-Chest CT ([**8-26**]): Bilat pleural effusions (R>L), significant
increase in size of pericardial effusion with possible
tamponade, no dissection, streaky inflammatory change near
pancreatic head and questionable wall thickening related to
gallbladder
-CXR Port AP ([**8-28**]): Cardiomegaly, suspected pulm venous
congestion, small left pleural effusion ->  repeat later in day
with increased LLL opacity
- MRSA Screen positive
- Ucx ([**8-21**]): Neg
- Bcx ([**8-21**]) 4/4 bottles + Coag Neg Staph

ECG: Afib vs Aflutter (Favor Flutter) with intermittent
conduction, rates in 150s, no significant ST changes

Pertinent studies:
TTE ([**2155-8-30**]): Suboptimal image quality. Possible thrombus vs.
vegetation (1 x 1.1 cm ) seen on the subcostal views which
appears to be attached to the ICD lead in the mid-right
ventricle. Tricuspid valve not well-visualized. Concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global left ventricular
systolic function. If clinically indicated, a transesophageal
echocardiogram may better assess for ICD lead mass and valvular
vegetations.

Pleural fluid cytology [**2155-9-10**]: NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

ECG [**2155-9-14**]: Atrial flutter with rapid and variable ventricular
response. Poor R wave progression. Cannot rule out prior
anterior myocardial infarction. Non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2155-9-11**]
atrial flutter is new.

CT chest [**2155-9-17**]: 1. Improved aeration of the left hemithorax
with residual left lower lobe atelectasis. Heterogeneous
loculated left pleural effusion also decreased, likely
representing hemothorax versus empyema.
2. Interval improvement in previously seen dense right upper
lobe opacities.  Improvement in previous right lower lobe
ground-glass opacities. 3. New dense rounded consolidation at
the right base, likely new focus of infection. 4. Small
pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2155-9-18**]: No
