Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CXR [**3-30**]:
HISTORY: ARDS and COPD, admitted with upper GI bleed.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2163-3-26**], there is
continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Diffuse
bilateral pulmonary opacifications could reflect pulmonary
edema, widespread pneumonia, or even ARDS. Extensive respiratory
motion somewhat blurs the resulting image.

CXR [**4-3**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant change. Extensive bilateral diffuse parenchymal
opacities at low lung volumes and minimal pleural effusions. The
image is consistent with ARDS. Moderate cardiomegaly. No
interval recurrence of new parenchymal opacities.

CXR [**4-5**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities consistent
with the
underlying disease. Moderate cardiomegaly. No evidence of newly
occurred
focal parenchymal opacities, the presence of minimal pleural
effusions cannot be excluded.

Microbiology:
[**3-30**] Urine culture:
STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
[**3-30**] MRSA screen negative
[**3-30**] Rectal VRE swab negative
[**4-6**] H. pylori serology negative

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the intensive care unit for
evaluation/treatment of GI bleed.  NG lavage was performed and
clear.  He received a total of 4 units of pRBCs (2 on [**3-30**] and 2
on [**4-3**]) with stable hematocrit and no further episodes of
melena. He was treated with a Protonix drip, transitioned to IV
bid. The GI team was consulted, and there was some concern that
he might need to be intubated for the procedure given his
history of interstitial lung disease (complicated by recent ARDS
at OSH and high O2 requirement). Ultimately, the patient and his
HCP decided against an endoscopy with or without intubation.
Plavix and aspirin were held given bleeding, and GI felt that he
would be at high risk for rebleed with Plavix given no
definitive intervention was done.  His need for Plavix was
discussed with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] he was determined to no longer need
this medication.  He was restarted on 81mg of aspirin daily
prior to discharge and transitioned to twice daily oral PPI.  He
will be on this medication for two months and then can
transition to once daily.

Hypoxia/IPF/COPD: The patient's hypoxia was likely
multifactorial and was thought to be due to ARDS in addition to
his COPD and IPF. The patient's steroid taper had finished on
[**4-4**] (after 5 days of prednisone 5 mg po daily). His oxygen
saturations improved with diuresis although he continued to
require several liters of supplemental oxygen.  His nebulizers
were continued.

Hx of CAD s/p PCI: He did not have any chest pain or discomfort
during the admission.  His metoprolol and simvastatin were
continued but his plavix and aspirin were initially held in the
setting of his GI bleed.  As mentioned above, his plavix was
completely stopped but he was restarted on 81mg of aspirin daily
prior to discharge.

Loose stool: Noted to have some loose stools on the day of
discharge, without melena or hematochezia. Did not test for C
diff, but GI advised testing for C diff if diarrhea continued.

Diabetes type II: He is on metformin and januvia as an
outpatient, but these had been held in the setting of variable
po intake.  While in the hospital, he was treated with sliding
scale insulin.

Herpes Zoster: Patient has an outbreak of herpes zoster on his
buttocks.  Upon review of his [**Hospital1 100**] records, he appears to have
started acyclovir treatment on [**3-25**], and this was stopped on
[**4-6**].

Hypertension: He was continued on metoprolol.

Hx of multifocal atrial tachycardia: He was in sinus rhythm
during the admission and continued on metoprolol.

Depression: His home sertraline was continued.

Nutrition: He was seen by speech and swallow and advised to have
1:1 supervision with feeds but can have regular diet with thin
liquids and meds whole with apple sauce.

Code status: DNR/DNI, confirmed with HCP
