PERTINENT LABS/STUDIES:

.
Radiologic studies:
.
CXR [**12-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Marked stable cardiomegaly. Retrocardiac opacity
which could be atelectasis versus ongoing infection. Question
possible small left pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 y/o gentleman with recent pericarditis, pericardial effusion
and pneumonia presents with chest discomfort, dyspnea on
exertion and bilateral lower extremity swelling.
.
# Hospital Acquired Pneumonia: He was treated on previous
admission with 5 days of levofloxacin.  On admission his CXR
showed a retrocardiac opacity.  His CT scan showed a left lower
lobe pneumonia/consolidation.  He was given ceftriaxone and
azithromycin in the ED.  Then in the MICU he was given
Vancomycin and Zosyn dose which was changed to Cefepime.  He
completed a 7 day course of Vancomycin and cefepime.  During the
last dose of the Vancomycin he spiked a fever to 101.8 and then
within one hour was 102.3.  It was unclear whether this fever
was related to the vancomycin. He continued to spike fevers and
the next morning had his pleural effusion tapped as detailed
below.
.
#. AFlutter:  The patient reverted to AFlutter on [**2188-12-28**].  He
has a h/o AFlutter in the setting of pericarditis, for which he
was cardioverted in [**Month (only) **].  The patient was given Lopressor
and Diltiazem, which did not decrease his heart rate.  He then
had an AFlutter ablation ON [**2188-12-30**], and he was continued on
Metoprolol.  He was restarted on Coumadin on [**2188-12-31**], which he
was instructed to take for one week.  The patient remained in
normal sinus rhythm for the remainder of his hospital course,
and he was scheduled for an outpatient appointment with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2189-1-2**].
.
# Pericardial effusion/pericarditis:  The patient was found to
have a pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology on
admission, which was thought to be secondary to his previously
diagnosed pericarditis.  Pulsus was followed with a maximum
pulsus of 14. The patient had three TTEs performed on this
admission, which all showed a decrease in the size of the
pericardial effusion.  The patient was started on Colchicine for
his pericarditis and his Coumadin was initially discontinued, as
this was thought to be increasing the size of his pericardial
effusion.  However, the patient was restarted on this medication
after his AFlutter ablation, with the intent of taking Coumadin
for one week.  The patient was scheduled for a TTE on [**2189-1-5**],
and he will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
.
# Pleural effusion:  During this admission, the patient was
found to have a pleural effusion, which was thought to be
related to the his pericardial effusion.  He was seen by IP who
felt that the the pericardial effusion was not large enough to
be tapped. Also he did not have a white count or fevers at that
time and thus the picture was not consistent with an empyema.
The pericardial effusion was stable from [**2188-12-18**] to [**2188-12-21**].  On
[**2188-12-25**] he spiked to 102.3 during his last dose of vancomycin.
He then continued to spike on [**2188-12-26**] at which time a CXR
showed a larger pleural effusion. The pleural effusion was
tapped by IP and he was found to have an exudate.  The gram
stain and cultures on this fluid were negative at the time of
discharge, and the patient's fevers had resolved for 48 hours
prior to discharge.
.
# Fevers: The patient was a febrile but did not have a
leukocytosis during this admission.  He spiked a fever on
hospital day 8, after completing his last dose of vancomycin.
He was still spiking on [**2188-12-26**] and his CXR showed a pleural
effusion which was tapped and exudative.  ID was consulted and
recommended various serologic s
