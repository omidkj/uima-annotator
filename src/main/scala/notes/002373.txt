History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90237**] is an 83 y/o F with a h/o critical AS (valve area
of 0.67cm2), AF on coumadin, h/o prior GIB not worked up due to
patient refusal, CRI who was initially transferred from [**Hospital3 12748**] for a CORE valve with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 914**],
who shortly after arrival was found to have platelets of 6, an
INR of 4.3 and an HCT that was initially 27.3 down to 24.2 with
active melena.  She initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on
[**2172-3-9**] with complaints of tightness and heaviness in her
epigastric region, that lasts for hours and has been present
intermittently for years.  During that hospital stay she was
diuresed with an increase in her lasix dose to 80mg from her
home dose of 40mg, and she underwent a work up of her abdominal
pain.  She had elevated LFT's, so she underwent a CT and HIDA
scan which showed cholilithiasis, no cholecystitis and
splenomegaly.  She was started on a PPI, and transfused 2 units
of PRBC's for her anemia.  After her doctors at the OSH felt
that her abdominal pain had resolved she was referred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for a percutaneous aortic valve replacement given her repeated
admissions for heart failure related her critical AS.
.
During her stay at the OSH her platelets were initially 131 on
[**3-9**], then 96 and 86 on [**3-10**], her HCT was 25.5 and increased to
31.6 after 2 units of PRBC's on [**3-10**], after that time she did
not have any further CBC's checked.  Her creatinine there was
2.24, which appears to be her baseline and her INR was initally
therapeutic and then increased to 4.0 and remained elevated
despite holding her coumadin.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] her initial VS were: 97.8, 156/55, 57, 18,
98% on 2LNC.  Initially she had no complaints except that she
felt her abdomen was "tight", but denied any chest pain,
palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, congestion, or
fever/chills.  Shortly after her arrival to the floor her
admission labs returned and were notable for platelets of 5, HCT
of 27.3, that on recheck had dropped to 24.2.  She was also
noted to be having melanotic stools.  A few hours later she
triggered on the floor for bradycardia transiently to the 30's
and relative hypotension to 104/51 from an initial baseline of
156/55.  At that time she was started on a PPI gtt, given
500cc's of IVF and 1 unit of PRBC's.  At that time given her
multiple medical concerns transfer was initiated to the MICU.
On arrival to the MICU her initial VS were: 97.1, 53, 148/43,
27, 98% on 1.5LNC.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

STUDIES:
RUQ U/S [**2172-3-16**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Shadowing gallstone seen within the gallbladder which does
not appear to be tense or distended. A minimal amount of
gallbladder wall edema is a
nonspecific finding as this may be related to the patient's low
albumin state; however, cholecystitis cannot be ruled out. If
there is concern for
cholecystitis, a HIDA scan could be performed for further
evaluation.
2. Mild splenomegaly.
3. Right pleural effusion

CXR [**2172-3-15**]:
FINDINGS: No previous studies for comparison.

The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. There is also prominence of
the
paratracheal stripe superiorly. This may be due to a prominent
thyroid or
vascular structures, lymphadenopathy or mass is felt less
likely. If there is high clinical concern, this could be further
evaluated with CT. There is coarsening of the bronchovascular
markings without focal consolidation,
pleural effusions or pulmonary edema. Bony structures are
grossly intact.

CXR [**2172-3-18**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-17**], there is further
improvement in pulmonary vascular status. Huge enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette persists. Soft tissue prominence in the
right paratracheal region is again seen, consistent with the
known goiter. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.


Echo [**2172-3-28**]:
The left atrial volume is severely increased. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic fu
