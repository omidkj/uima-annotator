Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of central venous line
Endotracheal intubation
Placement of hemodialysis catheter
Hemodialysis
Placement of arterial line for blood pressure monitoring

History of Present Illness:
 All based on OSH records (parts of OSH records unclear). [**Name2 (NI) **]
hospital records, the patient developed erythema and swelling of
his right medical thigh around [**2186-12-18**]. (recently treated with
clindamycin for LE cellulitis. Followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 98330**] at
[**Hospital3 2358**] for chronic open sores on LE's.) He began feeling
worse on [**12-21**] and was brought to [**Hospital6 **]. He
was given a dose of vancomycin and the plan was to go back to
prison on a course of vancomycin. Of note, on [**12-22**], the patient
became hypotensive to 86/42 and was treated with a NS blous.
BP's remained in the 70's to 80's on [**11-25**].
.
The patient was referred to [**Hospital6 33836**] on [**12-23**]
for worsening medial proximal thigh ulcer. He was continued on
vanocomycin and started on tigecycline and was transferred back
to prison that same day.
.
On [**2186-12-24**], the patient reported the sudden onset of left arm
weakness/numbness. He had decreased ROM of LUE. LLE was normal.
Denied HA at that time. + SOB (oxygenating 95% on 2L thoughtout
that day). He was seen by neurology who felt he had an embolic
stroke [**1-26**] to a fib (subtherapeutic INR) and was started on
coumadin and lovenox 100mcg [**Hospital1 **] (? dosing frequency) on [**2186-12-25**].

.
Renal was consulted at the OSH on [**2186-12-25**] for worsening renal
function/hyponatremia/hyperkalemia. They felt his issues were
likely related to intravascular volume depletion. It remains
unclear what his CRI is from (? prior renal injury from SBE, HCV
related?, HTN). At that time they had held his bumex and
spironalactone and continued him on IV NS.
.
Per OSH records the patient was "doing well" on the medicine
floor until the morning of [**12-27**] when he had an episode of
"massive hemoptysis" and respiratory distress. He was intubated
and transfered to the ICU. His original ABG was 7.17/47/77.
Frank blood and clots (>100cc) came from his ETT tube. He was
transfered 2 units of PRBC and FFP. He had a bronch at the OSH
which showed no definite acute bleeding. Transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] was
then arranged.
.
On [**Location (un) **], the patient was reportedly hypotensive and was
started on a dopamine drip. He was given 1 unit PRBC enroute [**1-26**]
hypotension.

of demise
Bronchial washings [**12-27**] no growth, cytology negative for
malignancy
Urine cultures 01/03, [**12-29**]: No growth
ASO: Positive at titer of 200-400
Respiratory virus screen: Negative
Leg ulcer wound culture [**12-29**]: GNR at time of death, ultimately
speciated to pseudomonas aeriginosa, pan sensitive
Sputum culture [**12-30**]: No growth at time of death, ultimately
grew acenetobacter baumanii, sensitive only to tobramycin and
imipenem.

Imaging
[**12-27**] CXR:
The ET tube tip is 2 cm above the carina.  The NG tube
terminates in the
stomach.  The right subclavian line tip terminates in the upper
SVC.  The
heart size is mildly enlarged.  There is severe calcification of
mitral
annulus.  Bilateral pleural effusion is small.  There is no
evidence of
congestive heart failure.
.
[**12-27**] head CT:
1) No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2) Bifrontal and biparietal subcortical white matter
hypodensities most likely relate to chronic micro-ischemic
disease, however, if there is high suspicion of acute stroke,
MRI would be more sensitive in further assessment.
3) Extensive sinus disease as above, with air-fluid l
