History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo woman with CHF (baseline EF 30%), CAD, MR, who was
admitted with syncope/pre-syncope. The patient is a poor
historian, but per my history she more had fatigue and malaise
and was found to have large (10cm) leg wound/ulcer leading to
transfer to OSH. During [**Location (un) 620**] admission, found to have acute
on chronic renal failure (now back to baseline with iv fluids),
elevated troponin (seen by cards who felt no active issue at
this time, no cath), repeat ECHO showed EF 10%. Also evaluated
by ID, who rec'ed Vanc/Zosyn for leg, also empiric treatment for
scabies (given) for a diffuse skin rash, though they felt that
this was unlikely, no scrapings done. Did have ABIs attempted
limited by calcified vessels and large leg ulcer. Of note, no
osteo seen on xray of leg. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for vascular
surgery eval. Vitals on floor: 98.2 108/58 /84 18 99RA

Persantine Mibi ([**2148-11-12**]): [**Age over 90 **] year old female with
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cad, infarct-related
cardiomyopathy, referred for evaluation. The patient was infused
with 0.142mg/kg/min of dipyridamole over 4 minutes as per
protocol. The patient did not complain of chest, back, neck or
arm pain during the infusion or recovery. The rhythm was sinus
throughout the procedure with rare, isolated APbs and rare,
isolated VPBs during the infusion and recovery. There were no
significant ischemic ST segment changes. The hemodynamic
response to the infusion was appropriate. 125 mg of
aminophylline IV was given at the end of the infusion, as per
protocol.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes.
.
The image quality is adequate.
Left ventricular cavity size is 267 mL.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a moderate fixed defect
of the septum, apex and anteroseptal walls and a severe fixed
defect of the inferolateral wall.
Gated images reveal global hypokinesis.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 15%.
IMPRESSION: 1. No reversible defects.
2. Moderate fixed defect of the septum, apex and anteroseptal
walls. Severe fixed defect of the inferolateral wall, all
consistent with multivessel disease.
3. Enlarged left ventricle with global hypokinesis. LVEF 15%.


Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Admission: [**Age over 90 **]F with multiple medical
problems, found to have [**Name (NI) **] in conjunction with a large
non-healing tibial ulcer.
.
Active Problems:
.
# [**Name (NI) **]: Unclear when occurred, EKG @OSH on [**11-5**] with STE
III/AVF in setting of previous q-waves documented without STE
prior. Also had MB elevations at OSH, seen by cards there and
felt to be a non-issue. Asymptomatic from this event. At [**Hospital1 18**],
had enzyme elevation suggesting an actual infarct; as she was
>24 hours out, no indication for intervention so was medically
managed. She was placed on a BB, high dose atorvastatin,
aspirin. Heparin gtt was not given as it was felt that her
infarct was complete.  She remained chest pain free throughout
the admission. On [**11-11**], developed an irregular SVT with rates
to ~200 that degenerted into VT with rates ~220+.  Was
symptomatic ("felt like passing out and felt warm") but not
shocked as she spontaneously converted to a rhythm at ~160 with
full conciousness. Was given 75mg lidocaine bolus and 5mg
metoprolol IV, started on Lidocaine gtt with conversion to a
stable sinus rhythm and good perfusion pressure and transferred
to the CCU. The lidocaine drip was discontinued and she was
started on IV loading dose of amiodarone over 18 hours and then
converted to PO amiodarone 400mg daily x 1 week to be dosed at
200mg daily thereafter. She had one very brief run of NSVT on
tele during her first night in the CCU (asymptomatic) and had
occasional PVC's without symptoms. She has a MIBI which showed
moderate fixed defect of the septum, apex and anteroseptal
walls. Severe fixed defect of the inferolateral wall, all
consistent with multivessel disease as well as an LVEF of 15%.
She was restarted on lisinopril and started on low-dose
spironolactone for medical management as MIBI revealed all fixed
defects. She was then transferred back to the floor, where
Lisinopril was d/c'ed [**1-24**] [**Last Name (un) **] in the setting of recently
restarted Lisinopril. She continued to have asymptomatic runs of
NSVT, which is being treated medically with Amiodar
