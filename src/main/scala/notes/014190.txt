Chief Complaint:
Admitted for the management of seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation followed by extubation; lumbar puncture

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 66  year-old female who presents with seizures.
Her history is unknown.  However from outside hospital reports,
she arrived at the hospital with concerns of shortness of breath
and an inhaler in her hand.  She then became unresponsive going
into respiratory distress.  She was intubated.  Following this
she developed tonic and then clonic movements.  It is unclear
how
long this lasted for, however she was given 1300 mg of
fosphenytoin, 250 mg of Keppra, 10 mg of ativan.  As she had a
fever she was given 4.5 grams of zosyn, 1 gram of vancomycin,
and
fentanyl.  Upon arrival she continued to have intermittent
episodes of jerking.


Past Medical History:
Asthma, HCV, Hx of TBI (MVA) many years ago requiring drain (s/p
removal) and craniotomy, history of opioid dependence


Social History:
Active IV cocaine use, currently enrolled in a methadone clinic
(confirmed dose of methadone 35mg daily) for hx of opioid
dependence (IV heroin). Also sister reports she abuses
presciption medicines and drinks wine. Recently released from
jail after being incarcerated for 5 yrs, currently living in a
motel on [**Hospital3 **].

No family hx of seizures

MRI of Spine:
Degenerative disc disease with moderate-to-severe bilateral
neural foraminal
narrowing at C3-4, C4-5, and C5-6. No cord compression seen.
Degenerative disc disease seen in the lumbar spine as described
with subacute Schmorl's node at L4-5 interspace. Note made of
bilateral pleural effusions with underlying lung atelectasis. A
2-cm cystic lesion, possibly arising from left ovary. An MRI of
the pelvis may be performed if clinically indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 41507**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] neuro-ICU for closer
monitoring. She was initiated on broad spectrum anti-infective
medications to cover for viral/bacterial forms of meningitis,
treated with IV keppra for her seizures, and remained on
continuous video EEG monitoring. She was seen and examined by
one of our senior epilpetologists, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 104943**]. After
extubation, she did well, and was subsequently transferred to
the floor. Her MRI showed postcraniotomy changes of the right
frontal bone with underlying encephalomalacia, and her EEG did
not show obvious seizure events. Re: postcraniotomy changes, I
am told by her PCP that she has a history of brain trauma and
recent release from incarceration.

Ultimately, it was thought that her seizures were provoked and
secondary to cocaine abuse (her UTOX was positive for cocaine
metabolites). On the floor, she did well and did not suffer from
any more seizures. Her acyclovir was continued until her HSV-PCR
returned negative, although we had a low suspicion for a viral
process to begin with. She was discharged with instructions to
follow up with her PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 5239**] Medical Center in [**Hospital3 **]. I
spoke with her NP[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 349**] and made her aware that a 2cm
ovarian cyst was incidentally discovered on her L-spine MRI and
likely can be followed up with either TVUS or abdominal CT/MRI.

On discharge, the patient's physical exam was such that she was
alert, awake and oriented with normal speech, comprehension and
intact short term memory. Her right pupil is fixed with an
anterior opacity, but her left pupil reacts to light well. Other
cranial nerves are unremarkable; there is no facial droop,
tongue is midline, sensation is grossly intact and her SCMs are
symmetric. Strength and sensation is symmetric and nonfocal, and
her gait is normal.
