History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32034**] is a72 year old man with history of type I diabetes
with triopathy, Cr4, and CHF(last ETT in [**2139**] reportedly
normal). The patient was in his usual state of health until

patient and his son thought this might be a cold, but decided to
go to [**Hospital 32036**] Hospital today where they noted that he had an O2
sat in 80's on room air.  He was given a dose of lasix and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.  The ED noted him to be
in CHF, JVP to jaw and lat ST depressions (which are old).  Pt
reported to be 92% on 4L.  Pt also given levaquin 500mg x1.

Pertinent Results:
EKG [**2142-8-3**]: NSR, nl axis, ST dep V5-6 (old)

CXR [**2142-8-3**]: Lateral aspect of the right lower chest is excluded
from the examination.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is more
pronounced.  Heart size is top normal.  Small left pleural
effusion may be present.  Greater opacification of the
retrocardiac lung is probably due to atelectasis at both lung
bases, though pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax.

[**2142-8-14**] 1. No evidence to suggest ischemia or infarction. 2.
Severely
enlarged left ventricular cavity size, increased from prior
study. 3. LVEF 34%, decreased from prior study.

[**2142-8-4**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color   Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left  ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic  function is severely
depressed with global hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi  are
seen in the left ventricle. There is mild global right
ventricular free  wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets  are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are  mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due  to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be  significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly  thickened. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic  pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-1-2**],
severe LV systolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension and afib
are new .

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32034**] is a 72 year old man with history of type I
diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency (cr4) pre-dialysis, here
with congestive heart failure exacerbation of unknown etiology.

1) Cardiac:
His CHF was initially treated aggressively with diuretics and
diuresed well with lasix + metolazone ant nitroglycerin drip.
Mr. [**Known lastname 32038**] [**Known lastname 461**] was last done in [**2141-12-27**] and
was noted to have an EF of 50%.  Repeat echo done on [**8-4**] (albeit
done shortly after going into AF) notes a much lower EF of 25%
with diffuse wall motion abnormalities.   On his second hospital
day, he developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response (he had no symptoms even with a HR to 160's).

The differential diagnosis for his diffuse cardiomyopathy was
ischemia versus a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.  Heart
rate control was attempted with lopressor as well as low-doses
of diltiazem.  On his third hospital day, he developed
hypotension and required transfer to the CCU.

Heparin drip was started for the atrial fibrillation and after
transfer to the CCU, the patient developed an upper GI bleed.
Cardioversion was performed.  He received one shock and went
into sinus rhythm for less than 1 minute.  Amiodarone IV and
then a PO load was started.  His synthroid dose was also
lowered.  His hypotension on the floor was later attributed to
his upper GI bleeding.  Within 1-2 days, the patient's AF
reverted to a predominantly sinus rhythm, but he continued to
have 2-6hr runs of AF to the low 100's noted on telemetry.  He
will continue 400mg daily for a total of one month.  Prior to
discharge, his beta blocker was converted from metoprolol to
carvedilol 25mg twice daily.

2) GI
For his upper GI bleed, this came on in the setting of initial
anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.  He had a positive
NG lavage x1liter.  An urgent EGD was performed and ulcerations
were noted in his esophagus and stomach.  He was started on
carafate for about a week as well as protonix twice daily.

3) Renal
For his renal failure, he had a fistula placed to his right arm
in late [**Month (only) 216**] prior to this admission.  Nephrology was
consulted and they recommended starting the patient on
hemodialysis for help with his fluid management.

4) ID
The patient had a productive cough, and an abnormal chest exam.
He was initially treated with levaquin, dosed renally.  Given
its QT prolonging effects, and a rising white blood cell count,
this was changed to cefepime.  He received a total of 2wks of
antibiotics and his WBC slowly fell to 8.

5) Nutrition
Renal diet. 1500cc fluid restriction.  Nutrition was consulted.

6) Prophylaxis
The patient was initially on heparin sc, then a heparin drip,
and then coumadin for DVT prophylaxis.  Following his GI bleed,
he was treated with protonix twice daily.

7) Communication: was with the patient, his daughter [**Name (NI) **] and
son [**Name (NI) **].  [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. is his HCP, power of attorney and family
