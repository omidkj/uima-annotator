Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14689**]
Chief Complaint:
decreased PO intake, confusion, worsening renal function


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
58M with history of metastatic bladder cancer s/p XRT, completed
carboplatin/gemcitabine [**8-27**], prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy,
CHF with LVEF (30%), HTN, DM, and recent ICU admission for
sepsis secondary to UTI, brought to ED from rehab with worsening
renal function.

Patient recently admitted [**Date range (1) 26021**].  Had initially presented
to OSH w/lethargy and hypotension with SBP 70s-80s (baseline
90s).  Was found to have UTI, also had urinary retention
requiring Foley placement. Was initially admitted to floor, but
developed recurrent hypotension requiring ICU transfer,
aggressive IVFs, and pressor support. Antibiotics were broaded
to vanc/cefepime.  All blood cx remained negative.  Urine cx at
OSH grew 10-50,000 mixed gram positive flora; urine cx at [**Hospital1 18**]
grew corynebacterium.  He completed 10 day course of cefepime;
vancomycin d/c'd after cultures came back and given concern it
was contributing to thrombocytopenia.  He was later restarted on
ceftriaxone given concern for recurrent UTI, but this was d/c'd
after 2 days given rising Cr and concern for AIN (urine eos
positive).  Patient's baseline Cr had been 1.2; was 2.1 at time
of d/c.  Had delirium during the admission, and was often not
oriented to place or time.  Was attributed to infection vs.
narcotics use.  Had thrombocytopenia likely related to his
[**Hospital1 3454**].  Was concern for possible drug effect from vancomycin,
and also concern for HIT.  Heparin dependent antibodies sent and
positive, but serotonin assay was negative (suggesting HIT not
etiology).  For his Afib/tachy-brady syndrome, he was continued
on his digoxin.  Metoprolol initially held given hypotension,
and was restarted at a lower dose.  Per notes, he was
persistently tachy in the 100s-110s, with occasional bursts to
the 120s-140s.  Did not have any bradycardia.  Despite ongoing
IVF administration during the admission, he did not develop any
evidence of volume overload/acute CHF.  Had anemia which was
attributed to his chemotherapy, though he also had hematuria
attributed to his bladder cancer.  Was transfused 2 units pRBCs
during the admission. Was guiac positive at one point in setting
of supratherapeutic INR, though later was guiac negative.
Coagulopathy presumed secondary to antibiotic therapy and poor
nutrition.  Developed diarrhea which was presumed secondary to
antibiotic use; C. diff was negative.  Of note, patient
continued to have intermittent fevers to as high as 101.5 during
his course, ultimately presumed to be related to his malignancy.
 His code status was changed to DNR/DNI prior to discharge, and
per records pt and his daughter were considering transition to
comfort focused care and possible hospice.  Per report, since
discharge has had poor PO intake.  Labs yesterday notable for
rising WBC from 22.5 to 24.5, and rising BUN/Cr.  Today, was
hypotensive to 80/58, tachycardic to 118, and more confused.
Was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.

In the ED, he triggered on arrival for hypotension with SBP in
80s.  Vitals on presentation 95.2 125 88/60 16 100% 2L.  Per
report, patient was mentating well.  Had mild TTP in suprapubic
area.  No UOP.  Labs notable for WBC 21.2 with 85.7% N, Hct 26.4
(recent baseline 24-28), BUN/Cr 44/2.4 (baseline Cr 1.2, though
was 2.1 on discharge [**2115-10-15**]), lactate 1.3.  Blood cultures
sent.  Patient did not urinate and refused straight cath;
therefore no UA/urine culture obtained.  Given history of recent
UTI and concern for sepsis secondary to urinary source, patient
given cefepime.  Also received 2L NS.  BP remained in 80s.  ED
unable to reach patient's daughter, but given recent discussions
of transitioning to comfort care, they held off on CVL placement
and initiation of pressors.  He is admitted now to ICU for
further management of his hypotension.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS 98.1 123 99/62 21 98% RA.
Patient oriented to person and place, but not time.  Answering
most questions appropriately, though some circumferential
answers.
