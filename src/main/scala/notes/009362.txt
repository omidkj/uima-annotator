Abdominal Pain, Hyperglycemia

History of Present Illness:
55 year old female with hx DMI, severe gastroparesis, HTN,
Grave's Disease and Hep C who presents with nausea/[**Month/Day/Year **] and
high blood glucoses for the past two days.  Per the patient she
has had two issues over the past weeks that she believes are
contributing to her hyperglycemia.  Firstly, she has struggled
more than usual with chronic constipation associated with her
diabetic gastroperesis and has not had a bowel movement in a
week and a half.  She reports that severe bouts of constipation
often exacerbate her diabetes.  Secondly, she reports that she
had an upper respiratory infection over the weekend with high
fevers of 102 and more along with upper respiratory symptoms,
fatigue, and some muscle aches.  Currently, her respiratory
symptoms have largely resolved and she denies purulent sputum or
severe cough instead just noting slight chest tightness that is
consistent with her asthma history.  Her primary symptoms now
are abdominal pain, nausea, and [**Month/Day/Year **], which have developed
over the last two days.  This is generalized abdominal pain.
She denies any hematemesis or melena.  She does become more
nauseous with eating even very small meals.  Ms. [**Known lastname 18741**] also
endorses polyuria and polydipsia.  She denies dysuria or
hematuria.  Blood glucoses at home have been running >300 and
have repeatedly been too high for her meter to quantify.  Of
note, the patient has had multiple admits within past two years
for DKA, most recent [**6-28**], with intubation for airway protection
and CVL placement.  Glucoses at home were >500 on multiple
checks.
   In [**Hospital1 18**] ED initial vital signs were 98.4, 112, 104/64, 16,
100% on RA and after fluids her geart rate came down to 108,
130/58, 100%.  Her initial labs were notable for anion gap of 28
and glucose>500K with keturia and glucosuria.  She received
morphine and ondansetron.  R femoral line placed after pIV
attempts unsucessful and the patient refused EJ attempts.
Currently, she is continuing to complain of abdominal pain, but
she does say her nausea is much improved after receiving
ondansetron in the ED.  She also complains of severe foot pain,
which is a longstanding problem in her and not significantly
changed from baseline.
