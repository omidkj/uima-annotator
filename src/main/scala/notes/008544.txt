FOOT AP,LAT & OBL RIGHT

Reason: assess for osteomyelitis

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
85 year old woman with R toe 1 gangrene
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for osteomyelitis
STUDY: Right foot three views performed on [**2176-4-10**].

HISTORY: This is an 85-year-old woman with right first toe
gangrene. Evaluate for osteomyelitis.

FINDINGS: No prior studies available for comparison. There are
extensive vascular calcifications identified. There is a soft
tissue defect seen over the distal aspect of the right first
toe. However, no definite cortical destruction is seen to
indicate radiographic signs of osteomyelitis. Lateral radiograph
is suboptimal as a portion of the first digit has been excluded
from the image.

IMPRESSION:

Soft tissue defect overlying the distal aspect of the first
digit without definite radiographic evidence for acute
osteomyelitis.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Question CHF

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
85 year old woman s/p PTX, s/p removal of CTs, now with
increasing dyspnea and increased secretions
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Question CHF
HISTORY: 85-year-old female with dyspnea.

COMPARISON: CT chest [**2176-2-9**], and multiple chest
radiographs in [**2176-1-31**].

AP PORTABLE CHEST: Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position
approximately 7 cm above the carina. A left-sided PICC line
terminates in the proximal SVC. Compared to most recent prior
chest radiograph, [**2176-2-22**], there has been interval
improvement in small bilateral pleural effusions. Chronic
bilateral increased interstitial markings persist consistent
with chronic interstitial lung disease. There is improvement in
vascular congestion, and there is no evidence of CHF currently.
The heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged
given differences in position.

IMPRESSION: Improvement in small bilateral pleural effusions.
Chronic interstitial lung disease. No CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt directly admitted to SICU due to all her comorbid
conditions.Pt placed on trach mask. Pt palced on VAncomycin as
precautioanry measure for underlying osteomyelitis. A FXR was
ordered and showed soft tissue destruction but no osteomyelitis.
Labs were sent. Pt palced on G-tube to gravity and left NPO. On
HD 2, pt pre-oped for OR. Pt underwent a right hallux
amputation. Offical operative report can be read in the chart.
Pt tolerated the procedure well and was transfered back to the
SICU in stable condition. Infectious disease was consulted to
assess if there were any other underlying infectious causes of
elevated white count. They felt that the increase could be
attributed to the long term steroid use. A UA and sputum culture
were obtained as precautionary measure. Pt d/c back to [**Hospital1 15554**] on HD 3. VAnco was d/c. Instructions sent to have pt
seen by PCP for decreasing steroid dose. pt is to follow up with
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in 2 weeks.
