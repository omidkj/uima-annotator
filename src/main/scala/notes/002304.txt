[**2199-10-23**] ECHO
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
atrium is elongated. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricle displays normal free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. The non-coronary cusp is immobilized. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is receiving epinephrine by infusion.
There is normal right ventricular systolic function. There is
normal left ventricular systolic function. There is a
bioprosthesis in the aortic position. It is well seated. The
leaflets are not well seen. No aortic insufficiency is
appreciated. There is a maximum gradient of 28 mm Hg and a mean
of 15 mm Hg across the valve at a cardiac output of 5.5 l/m. The
effective orifice area is about 1.6 cm2. The tricuspid
regurgitation is increased to mild. The thoracic aorta appears
intact.

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2199-10-27**] 8:38 AM

Final Report
PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM [**10-27**]
HISTORY: Previous pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**10-23**] through
31:
Small bilateral pleural effusion right greater than left has
stabilized since [**10-25**], after increasing since [**10-24**].
Large post-operative
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Azygos distention
suggests elevated central venous pressure or volume but there is
no pulmonary edema. Bibasilar atelectasis is mild and improved
since [**10-25**]. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 54488**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-10-23**] for elective
surgical management of his aortic valve disease. He was taken
directly to the operating room where he underwent a redo
sternotomy with an aortic valve replacement using a porcine
valve. Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively he
was taken to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic monitoring.
Later that day, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. Beta blockade, aspiriin and his statin were resumed.
On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the step down
unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility.
Over the next several days his gradually improved in strength
and mobility. On POD 5 he was discharged to rehabilitation at
[**Hospital3 15644**] in [**Location (un) 47**].
