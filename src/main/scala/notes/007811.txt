Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
66F with PMH diabetes and psoriatic arthritis on Infliximab,
methotrexate, prednisone taper who p/w ~5 day hx of fevers (to
103), B/L rib pain, and chills. Pt was on cruise in Bermuda and
returned 4d ago. During the cruise, she had an allergic reaction
on her face to a spa facial, resolved after about a week. [**12-17**]
days after, her rigors and fever started. Also noted pain in B/L
ribs recently. Has a h/o CP that her cardiologist has attributed
to costochondritis. Her last dose of infliximab was 4 weeks ago,
was scheduled for next dose on day of admission but cancelled
due to fevers. She saw her PCP in clinic yesterday, who was
concerned about infection given the rigors, fever, and
immunosuppressive meds, and wanted her to get cultures and
abdominal CT to r/o abdominal abscess. Of note, the patient
underwent liver biopsy one month ago at [**Hospital1 112**] after she had
developed liver "problems" when on MTX previously, biopsy was
normal per pt. this time. Endorses recent weight gain from
prednisone, about 50 pounds over the past year.

In the ED, initial VS: 98.8 81 106/67 16 96% RA. On exam, she
was TTP in ribs, LLQ, knee and hand joints. Abdominal CT w/
contrast and CTA chest showed no PE or PNA, increased central
lymphadenopathy of undetermined significance, no abscess. She
was noted to desaturate to the high 80s on room air and so was
admitted to medicine. VS at transfer: 98.7 78 134/67 17 95% 3L
NC. She was given 1L NS in the ED.

Overnight, her O2 requirement started to increase to the point
that she was persistent hypoxemic to low 80s on a 40% ventimask.
ABG showed 7.43/42/68.  ID was consulted as there was concern
for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].  She was started on bactrim 2 DS TID for PCP
treatment, increased to prednisone 30 mg [**Hospital1 **] (from her 2.5 mg a
day taper dose).  She was then admitted to the MICU for
persistent hypoxemia.

In the MICU, there was suspicion for volume overload causing her
hypoxemia in addition to possible infection. She was started on
IV lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and continued on the bactrim/prednisone
regimen. Her hypoxemia improved. She no longer required
ventimask and was transferred back to the medicine floor. On the
floor, she did not complain of SOB but did complain of continued
chest wall tenderness and pain in her joints. She denied fever,
chills, night sweats, or LOA. She was mainly concerned about
being on a higher dose of prednisone, as it took her a long time
to be weaned down to 2.5mg per day.
