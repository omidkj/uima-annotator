Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2102-11-27**] - Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x5 with left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and
saphenous vein grafts to diagonal, obtuse marginal and
sequential saphenous vein grafts to posterior descending artery
and posterior left ventricular branch.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89204**] is a 48yoM with history of CAD, cryptogenic
cirrhosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and chronic
anemia and [**Hospital 89205**] transferred from OSH for NSTEMI. The
patient states that his symptoms began 3 weeks ago, when he
noticed worsening DOE. Previously, he was able to walk 18 holes
of golf without any CP/SOB. Over the past 3 weeks, he has only
been able to walk 300 feet before he experiences CP/SOB. He
describes the pain as sub-sternal "tightness/burning" with
radiation to the jaw. The pain is [**6-30**] in severity and
assocaited with weakness and lightheadedness. Denies associated
N/V, diaphoresis or palpitations. He came to the hospital this
morning because he expereicned the worst chest pain he has ever
had while removing luggage from the overhead bin on a flight
from [**State 108**]. He prompty sat down, and the pain resolved within
2 minutes. He states that the pain he has had over the past 3
weeks is reliably relieved by rest and states he has ever had
CP/SOB at rest. He has 2 pillow orthopnea with is unchanged over
the past several years. He has also had a non-producitve cough
for the past few weeks.
.
Patient was last at [**Hospital1 **] in [**5-/2102**] for work-up of stable angina.
He had a non-diagnostic stress test (TWI and ST depressions in
lateral leads, did not achieve goal HR, nuc negative) at that
time and was transferred for possible cardiac catheterization.
Given bleeding risk with known varices, thrombocytopenia, and
chronic kidney disease, patient instead underwent coronary CT,
which showed significant calcification throughout all of his
coronary arteries, with probable significant narrowing of the
LCx and OM. As he had no chest pain, enzyme elevations, or
abnormalities on [**Hospital **] medical management was preferred over PCI.
During this admission, he also had a HCT of 24.8 (baseline 30)
and guaiac positive stool. The hepatology team was consulted to
comment on his risk of bleeding if he were to start dual
anti-platelet therapy. An endoscopy showed a pair of duodenal
polyps, of which one was actively oozing blood.
.
At the OSH, he had a troponin I of 4.[**Street Address(2) 89206**]
depressions and a HCT 21. Guiac was negative. He received ASA
325 and 1U pRBCs and was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for possible cath.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 98.2 75 139/73 18 96% 4L Nasal Cannula.
Patient denied chest pain, nausea, vomiting, back or arm pain.
His labs were significant for troponin of 0.68 and HCT of 26.3.
Exam was significant for bibasilar crackles. Patient received
gabapentin 300 mg x1 (home medication that he wanted to take).
Patient was ordered 1 unit PRBC and was given lasix 10 mg IV x1
with the blood. On transfer vitals were 98.4, 72, 128/62, 24,
100 on 4L.
.
Currently, VS are:
T 98.4 HR 77 BP 132/79 RR 16 O2 Sat 97% 4L NC
Denies CP/SOB, arm/back pain, N/V, lightheadedness, diaphoresis.

Studies:
TTE ([**2102-11-16**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the anterior
septum, anterior free wall, and apex. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2102-6-13**], anterior and apical hypokinesis are now present.

.
Cardiac Cath ([**2102-11-17**]):
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel CAD. The LMCA was patent.  The LAD had
a 40%
proximal stenosis and a 90% mid vessel stenosis. The LCx had
diffuse
disease up to 60% with a 70% stenosis in a major OM branch. The
RCA had
a 95% stenosis in both large PL branches.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
systolic pressures with an SBP of 121 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel CAD.
2. Normal systemic blood pressure.

FINDINGS: The hepatic architecture is unremarkable. No focal
liver lesion is identified. No biliary dilatation is seen. The
gallbladder is contracted as the patient ate prior to the
ultrasound. A small shadowing stone is seen at the neck of the
gallbladder. The pancreas and aorta are obscured from view by
overlying bowel. The spleen is enlarged measuring 14.4 cm. No
hydronephrosis is seen. The visualized portion of the IVC is
unremarkable. There
