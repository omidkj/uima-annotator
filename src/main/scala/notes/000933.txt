Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital3 **] for VT ablation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EP study
VT ablation
Aortic catheterization with abdominal aortogram
and pelvic runoff, right common iliac artery stent, right

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 70 y/o with a history of CAD, CHF, prostate CA,
hyperlipidemia, DM, atrial fibrillation who presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2165-4-21**] after feeling dizzy and not himself after
dinner. His friends reported that he also looked very pale, and
activated EMS. He said he has felt like this in the past, but
usually after pacer firing. He was waiting in the ED at Sturdy
at rest, and his pacer fired. He was admitted and taking up to a
room. at around 1am as he stood up from lying down. This
discharges were for ventricular tachycardia. According to the
discharge summary, he had approx 5 runs of VT while on telemetry
and his ICD fired once.

denied CP, dyspnea, nausea or diaphoresis; pt did feel his
"typical funny" palpatations and "a bit dizzy" as per prior
events that trigger his ICD.

pt was recently discharged from [**Hospital3 **] for treatment of
RAF following 7 recorded ICD discharges on [**4-12**]; dofetilide was
added to a regimen of digoxin and increased toprol with
subsequent conversion to sinus rhythm. Pt was discharged home on
dofetilide 250 mg, and had been well controlled until [**4-17**]
episode.

Patient has had 4 difference pacers placed since [**2159**]. The first
was replaced for infection 2 weeks after placement. The second
and third were removed for abnormal firing.

Pertinent Results:
[**2165-4-24**] ART DUP EXT LOW/BILAT C
IMPRESSION: Peak systolic velocities do not show evidence of
significant
proximal femoral artery stenosis on either side.
A more comprehensive assessment may be obtained with pulse
volume recordings and segmental blood pressure measurements, if
clinically indicated.

[**2165-4-24**] Carotid dopplers
IMPRESSION:
1. There is 40-59% stenosis within the right internal carotid
artery.
2. There is 70-79% stenosis within the left internal carotid
artery.

[**2165-4-24**] US aorta and branches
IMPRESSION: Fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4
cm in
greatest dimension.

[**2165-4-25**] ECHO
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %). with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

[**2165-4-26**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior
wall, anterior septum, inferolateral wall, and apex. There is
mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments. Quantitative
(biplane) LVEF = 22%. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. No
pericardial effusion.

[**2165-4-27**] CT abd/pelvis with contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal aorta measuring up to
3.4 cm in
greatest axial dimension.
3. Right iliac stent.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 70 y/o with hx of CAD, CHF, VT with pacer placement
and multiple ablations here for VT and pacer firing, transferred
here for EP study and ablation
.
Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient presented to [**Hospital 8125**] hospital
after feeling lightheaded and will. There, he had 5 episodes of
ventricular tachycardia on tele, and his ICD fired once while in
the waiting room. The patient had been on  digoxin and
transferred on amiodarone gtt. He had had multiple ablations in
the past and on admission had a dual chamber ICD. He has had
thyroid and liver abnormalites from amiodarone in the past, and
so the amiodarone was discontinued on admission, but he recieved
800mg PO x2 prior to procedure. On [**2165-4-25**] he had a VT ablation.
He had ablation of inducible ventricular tachycardia (RBBB
superior axis CL 400. He had mechanical bump termination of the
tachycardia in apical septum which caused noninducibility. The
ablation was guided b the site of termination and pacemapping.
Nonspecific endpoint on noninducibility given noninducibility
prior to ablations. His device was reprogrammed.  Prior to the
procedure he was on heparin until INR. Post procedure he was on
heparin bridge to coumadin.
During the procedure he was noticed to have a cold leg. He was
transferred to the CCU:
CCU COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the CCU following a VT ablation when
it was noted that his right leg was cool and mottled. His right
common iliac artery was dissected. Vascuar surgery consult was
called. This was repaired with stent. His pulses returned.  He
was transfered to the CCU for monitoring, and did well. His feet
remained warm and well perfused.  There was no recurrence of VT.
He was trasnfered back to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service in good condition,
continued on heprain, aspirin, and plavix as well as coumadin.
His INR on transfer was 1.7.
- Also of note, he was had a pre and post ablation ECHO. He was
monitored on telemetry throughout the admission and did not have
recurrance ventricular tachycardia. He was continue metoprolol
50mg [**Hospital1 **], digoxin. LFTs WNL, checking baseline while on
amiodarone. TSH: 3.8. He also had ultrasounds of carotids,
femoral arteries and AAA for history of AAA, carotid bruit.
.
Atrial fibrillation: on coumadin, beta blocker, digoxin. He was
on heparin after procedure as bridge back to coumadin.
.
CAD: s/p MI, and PCI.
- continue plavix, metoprolol, aspirin, atorvastatin 80mg
.
Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: EF 20% in [**2160**].
- continue metoprolol 50mg, Lisinopril 10mg, lasix 40mg daily,
digoxin .125 mcg daily.
.
HTN: currently normotensive. continue metoprolol and lisinopril.

.
Diabetes Mellitus type II: continue insulin 70/30 10units qAM
and insulin sliding scale while here
.
Chronic kidney disease: baseline 1.5-1.8 this admission and
