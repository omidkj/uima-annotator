Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
57 yo M with h/o ulcerative colitis on enterocort and mesalamine
referred from [**Hospital 3390**] clinic with hypotension. Notably, patient was
recently admitted from [**Date range (1) **] with sepsis related to a
pneumonia and completed a course of levaquin [**1-22**].  On the day
of admission, he saw his PCP as [**Name Initial (PRE) **] post hospitalization follow up
and was found to be hypotensive to 60 systolic while standing.
Pt reported fever to 101 over a few days before admission.  He
had been tolerating PO intake and denied nausea, vomiting or
diarrhea. He had normal stool output. He was referred into the
ED for further evaluation.
.
In the emergency department initial vitals were Temp:96 HR:112
BP:89/49 Resp:18 O(2)Sat:99. BP came up to 118/71 after 2L of
IVF. Pt received Vanc, Levofloxacin and Flagyl as well as dose
of hydrocortisone 100mg. Blood cxs were drawn.
.
On arrival to the MICU, v/s: T=98.7 HR=74 BP=117/76 O2 Sat= 99%
on RA. Pt reports feels much better after the IVF.

Past Medical History:
Longstanding ulcerative colitis proctocolectomy and pouch anal
stenosis in [**2141**] with subsequentpouch resection and end
ileostomy due to a stricture in the mid pouch and a leak at the
top of the pouch.
B12 deficiency on IM vitamin B-12 injection
Depression treated with Effexor
Olecrenon Bursitis
liver function chronically elevated with an ALT of 84. This can
be related to autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease, or alcohol
intake.
History of spontaneous pneumothorax at age 18, treated with
chest tube
Right thumb tendon injury [**2141**].
Actinic keratoses/seborrheic keratosis

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
B12 deficiency, depression, olecranon bursitis, elevated ALT,
history of spontaneous pneumothorax at age 18, right thumb
tendon
injury in [**2141**], actinic keratoses, and seborrheic keratoses.
.
ULCERATIVE COLITIS HISTORY
1.  Diagnosed in [**2140**].
2.  Status post total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal
stenosis in [**2141**].
3.  Stricture in the mid pouch and a stricture or leak at the
top
of the pouch at the afferent loop.  Underwent resection of blind
loop and diverting ileostomy for this in [**2146**] and then a ventral
pouch resection and end ileostomy.
4.  [**2148**] recurrent presacral abscesses status post multiple
drainage procedures and occurrence of an intraperitoneal fistula
at the site of prior diverting ileostomy with take down of
fistula.  Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 10946**] note, "I should emphasize that
prior to this operation I had all of his prior pathology
reviewed, and although he had been labeled as having Crohn's
disease he in fact truly has ulcerative colitis".
Intraoperatively, there was no evidence of Crohn's.
5. [**2150**] presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea.  CT showed
thickening in the distal small bowel, treated with IV Cipro,
Flagyl followed by p.o.  Cipro, Flagyl and a small bowel
follow-through that was normal.  ANCA serologies reportedly
negative or diagnostically UC at thetime.
8. [**2156**] presented with a cutaneous fistula and found to be a
subcutaneous fistula rather than enterocutaneous fistula.
Underwent ileoscopy that showed a single ulcer in the distal
ileum at 10 cm from the stoma with biopsy consistent with
chronic
active enteritis and focal ulceration of granulation tissue.  No
granulomas or dysplasia.
9.  Admission in [**11/2159**] for abdominal distention, decreased
ostomy output, and found to have active inflammation of the last
20 cm of his ileum.


Social History:
He is divorced.  He has three children age 23, 20, and 19.  He

Customs Department.  He smokes one and a half packs per day.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 year old male with history of ulcerative colitis on
mesalamine and budesonide who presented to the ED with
hypotension on [**2160-1-21**] after a recent admission for pneumonia
treated with levofloxacin.

# Hypotension: differential included SIRS/sepsis vs. hypovolemia
vs. adrenal insufficiency.  Given dry mucous membranes, possibly
increased ostomy output, hypovolemia seemed most likely.
Budesonide is not supposed to be systemically absorbed, so seems
less likely to cause adrenal insufficiency.  There were no other
suspected precipitants for adrenal insufficiency in the patient.
 Patient had recently finished levofloxacin for inpatient
pneumonia complicated by sepsis.  His complaints did not suggest
relapse or failure of antibiotic therapy.  Patient was
administered IV fluids until blood pressure responded, as well
as hydrocortisone once and dexamethasone while admitted for
stress dose steroid dosing.  Blood cultures were performed and
showed no growth at the time of discharge, but were not ye
