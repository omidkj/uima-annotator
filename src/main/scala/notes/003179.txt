Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated by EMS

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5395**] is a 53 yo man with obesity, glucose intolerance and
borderline hypertension who was initially taken to an OSH after
being found at home by his son nearly unresponsive with vomitus
on his shirt.
.
He was intubated in the field and taken to [**Hospital3 **]. On
admission, he was febrile to 103, tachycardic to the 140s,
tachypneic to the high 30s and sating in the 80s on high FiO2
initially. He underwent LP, CT head and CXR, which revealed
bilateral patchy pulmonary infiltrates and evidence of
mastoiditis. His initial WBC count was 4.7 and initial BUN/Cr
was 28/3.8. A d-dimer was positive, but given the renal failure,
he only underwent LENIs that did not demonstrate evidence of
thrombosis. He was initially broadly covered with antibx for
PNA, both CAP and aspiration, and bacterial meningitis and HSV
encephalitis with acyclovir, ceftriaxone, ampicillin,
azithromycin, vancomycin, clindamycin. The LP was not suggestive
of meningitis or encephalitis. Sputum gram stain demonstrated 4+
GPCs in pairs, chains and clusters, and sputum and blood
cultures are pending. His inital CK was ~2400 and rose to
~20,000. Urine was apparently positive for Strep pneumoniae
antigen.
.
On further history from the pt's wife, he had been in his usual
state of health until the night prior to admission to [**Hospital1 5979**]. At that time, he was c/o ear fullness, but he did not
mention fever or cough. The next day, the pt's son tried to
awaken him in the middle of the day, but he was apprently taking
a nap and did not want to be disturbed. Later that evening, the
pt's son returned home, and the pt could not be awakened, so EMS
was called.
.
ROS was otherwise unobtainable.

.
[**2146-12-20**] Chest CT: 1) Bilateral, multifocal consolidation; CT
appearance in correlation with laboratory/clinical history
suggestive of multifocal pneumonia, however improvement on
subsequent chest radiograph is somewhat atypical. Findings and
distribution not typical for aspiration or noncardiogenic
pulmonary edema.
2) Fatty liver.
.
[**2146-12-20**] Head Ct: 1. Hypodense globus pallidi which may represent
carbon monoxide or other toxin exposure. Consider MRI for
further evaluation.
2. Fluid-filled mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities.
3. Periodontal disease and/or current or old infection around
the roots of multiple teeth.
4. No acute hemorrhage, masses, or mass effect.
.
[**2146-12-21**] MRI/MRA Head - T2 hyperintensities and slow diffusion
involving the globus pallidi as well as small foci of slow
diffusion involving the deep watershed distribution bilaterally
and the right anterior watershed distribution. These findings
may represent carbon monoxide poisoning or other toxin exposure
versus global hypoxia/anoxia.
.
[**2146-12-23**] MRI Head - 1) T2 hyperintensities and slow diffusion
involving the globus pallidi as well as the subcortical white
matter are unchanged since [**2146-12-21**] and may represent global
hypoxia/hypoperfusion event or carbon monoxide poisoning.
2) Bilateral mastoiditis.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 53 yo man intially found lying on his couch unresponsive
covered in vomitus transferred from OSH with multilobar
pneumonia, ARDS, acute renal failure and bilateral globus
pallidus hypodensity on head CT, doing well since extubated
yesterday, some right deltoid weakness on exam.
.
# PNA/ARDS: possibly [**1-21**] Strep pneumo (suspected given urine
positive for S.pneumo antigen at OSH) complicated by aspiration
and ARDS.  Also possibly aspiration pneumonia [**1-21**] vomiting and
decreased mental status from unknown precipitant.  He was
intubated in the field by EMS and transferred to [**Hospital1 **].  Nasopharyngeal aspirate at OSH with Strep pneumo and
Hemophilus influenza.  He was transferred here on [**12-20**] due to
incrasing ventillatory requirements and ARDS.  He was maintained
on low pressure mechanical ventillation.  In addition,
antibiotic coverage was broadened to vancomycin, zosyn and
ciprofloxacin per ID recommendations to cover for ventillator
associated pneumonia given his persistant fevers up to 103.  He
continued to improve daily and was extubated [**2146-12-25**] without
difficulty.  Ciprofloxacin was weaned off on day 7.  Vancomycin
and Zosyn were continued to complete a 14 day course.
.
#Bilateral Globus Pallidus Infarct/Unresponsive on Admission -
very concerning for anoxic brain insult vs toxic metabolic
process. Also classically seen in CO poisoning, although no
evidence of other family members affected so less likely. MRI
confirmed this finding also with decreased signal in watershed
areas of the brain also seen with anoxic insult. Repeat MRI did
not show progression.  CSF at [**Hospital3 **] without growth on
culture. Patient had right deltoid weakness which per neurology
was likely to right brachial plexus injury from his time down on
his right side.  This clinically improved during his admission.
Otherwise no focal neuro deficits.
   Patient scheduled to f/u with behavioral neurology.

.
#Diarrhea - Patient with profuse diarrhea on admission and
throughout most of ICU stay.  Stool studies negative for C.diff
x5.  He was treated with brief course of oral flagyl, however
this was stopped early as the diarrhea resolved and stool
studies were negative.
.
#Bilateral opacification of middle ear and mastoid air cells-
seen on head ct at OSH, pt also had been reporting ear fullness.
Currently denies ear pain but state that ears don't feel normal.
Seen by ENT, felt that radiographic and clinical signs not c/w
mastoiditis.
-if necessary pt can f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 77020**]
.
#ARF: Likely combination of volume depletion and mild degree of
rhabdomyolysis [**1-21**] being down vs possible seizure.  Resolved.
.
# Rhabdomyolysis:  He had elevated CPK up to 20,000 at OSH
possibly due to seizure, but no evidence of seizure activity on
EEG at OSH, also possibly from being down for prolonged time.
CK's trended down with IVF.
