HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
white female with diabetes, hypertension, chronic low back
pain, who was evaluated by her PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) 958**] for her back
pain.  Plain films showed degenerative arthritis and an
abdominal aortic aneurysm.  CT scan of the abdomen done at
[**Hospital1 **] confirmed a 4.9 cm AAA.  The patient was
referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] for further treatment.

The patient's back pain has been controlled with Vicodin but
has worsened her preexisting constipation.  The patient
complained of bilateral band-like upper abdominal pain, worse
with movement of her arms.  She has also decreased her oral
intake due to abdominal discomfort.  She was admitted for
further treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

2.  Hypertension.
3.  Chronic low back pain.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Bilateral carpal tunnel release.
2.  Cataract extraction O.U.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa causes swelling.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Glyburide.
2.  Verapamil.
3.  Prilosec.
4.  Zocor.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  She quit smoking
tobacco about 15 years ago.  She has approximately six
glasses of wine per week.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.2, pulse 74, respirations 18, blood pressure 174/75 on the
right, 171/75 on the left, 02 saturation equals 97% on room
air.  General:  Alert, cooperative white female in no acute

without murmur.  Lungs:  Clear bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft,
distended, mild diffuse tenderness.  Palpable aortic
aneurysm.  Extremities:  Feet equally warm.  No edema.  Pulse
examination:  Carotid, radial, femoral pulses 2+ bilaterally.
Popliteal and dorsalis pedis pulses were 1+ bilaterally.  PT
pulses have biphasic Doppler signals bilaterally.
Neurologic:  Nonfocal.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Admission laboratories revealed
a WBC of 7.5, hematocrit 33.8, platelets 318,000, PT 12.6,
PTT 23.5, INR 1.0.  Sodium 142, potassium 4.2, chloride 106,
C02 22, BUN 22, creatinine 1.1, glucose 68.

Chest x-ray showed no acute pulmonary disease, compression
deformities of the lower thoracic vertebra present.

EKG on [**2164-5-22**] showed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 77.

CT of the abdomen showed a 5 by 5 cm infrarenal AAA with
extension into both iliacs, left greater than right.  No
leaking, no dissection.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially evaluated in the
Emergency Room on [**2164-5-22**].  She was admitted to the Vascular
Surgical Service on [**2164-5-23**].  The Cardiology Service was
consulted for preoperative clearance.  They ordered a
Persantine MIBI study which showed a moderate, reversible
anterior wall perfusion defect.  They cleared the patient for
urgent surgery with careful hemodynamic perioperative
monitoring.

On [**2164-5-26**], the patient underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm
repair with Dacron graft.  Postoperatively, the patient had
equally warm feet with pedal Doppler signals.  In the early
afternoon of [**2164-5-26**], the patient developed a cold,
pulseless right leg with no palpable femoral pulse and no
Dopplerable pedal pulses.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room several hours
later where she underwent thrombectomy of the right
aortoiliac limb of her graft and had a right common iliac
artery to right common femoral artery bypass graft with
Dacron.  Postoperatively, the patient had equally warm feet
and Doppler signals of the right DP and left DP/PT.  The
patient was transferred to the SICU.  The patient developed
significant oozing at her incision site and had required 8
units of packed red blood cells, 4 units of fresh frozen
plasma, 2 units of platelets and IV vitamin K for
coagulopathy.  She received several doses of Kefzol
perioperatively.  An epidural for pain control was removed on
postoperative day number two.

The patient was unable to be weaned and extubated.

The patient developed a low-grade fever.  Blood cultures were
drawn.  Sputum culture was sent.  Stool for Clostridium
difficile was negative times three.  On [**2164-6-4**], the patient
spiked to 103.  She was jaundiced.  A gallbladder ultrasound
was negative.  Blood cultures showed gram-negative rods which
were later identified as Enterobacter cloacae.  Initial
sputum culture grew Hemophilus and a repeat sputum culture
grew Enterobacter.  Urine culture also grew Enterobacter.
Zosyn had been started and vancomycin had been added shortly
afterwards.

The patient completed a two week course of IV vancomycin and
subsequently will finish two weeks of oral levofloxacin.

Diuresis with Lasix was started in the hopes of removing 1-2
liters of fluid per day.  The patient's preoperative weight
was 73 kilograms and postoperatively was 90 plus kilograms.
The patient responded well to Lasix.  She was finally able to
be extubated on [**2164-6-15**], postoperative day number 20.

The patient was started on TPN during her prolonged
intubation.  She was then started on Trophik tube feedings
via postpyloric Dobbhoff catheter.  The patient was started
on clear liquids on [**2164-6-17**].  She did extremely well and her
feeding catheter was removed the following day.  She was able
to tolerate a house diet over the next 24 hours without
difficulty and was ready for discharge.

Staples from surgical incision were removed on [**2164-6-16**].
Physical Therapy evaluated the patient and recommended
[**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation initially.  However, the patient
was anxious to be discharged to the home of her sister
in-law.  Physical Therapy reassessed the patient and felt
that she would be safe to go home but recommended physical
therapy at home.

At the time of discharge, the patient's surgical incisions
were clean, dry, and intact.  She had palpable dorsalis pedis
pulses bilaterally.

While on tube feedings, the patient had been started on 10
units of NPH insulin b.i.d. in addition to her Glyburide 5 mg
p.o. q.d.  After resuming a normal diet, the patient had low
blood sugars and the NPH insulin was discontinued.  The
patient was instructed to continue taking her Glyburide 5 mg
p.o. q.d. and following up with her primary care physician
within [**Name Initial (PRE) **] week after discharge from the hospital to reassess
her blood sugar control.

The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in
the office in two weeks by calling the office for an
appointment.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for 11 days to finish a two
week course.
2.  Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4.  Simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Timolol 0.25% ophthalmic solution one drop O.U. b.i.d.
6.  Tylenol 325-650 mg p.o. q. four to six hours p.r.n.

DISPOSITION:  Home with home physical therapy.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
2.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm resection with aortobi-iliac
Dacron graft on [**2164-5-26**].
3.  Thrombectomy, right limb of bypass graft and right
iliofemoral Dacron bypass graft on [**2164-5-26**].

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Blood loss anemia, status post transfusion.
2.  Postoperative coagulopathy, treated.
3.  Respiratory failure with prolonged intubation until
postoperative day number 20.
4.  Enterobacter urosepsis.
5.  Enterobacter pneumonia.
6.  Postoperative malnutrition, treated with total parenteral
nutrition and tube feedings.
7.  Jaundice, resolved.
8.  Anasarca, treated.
