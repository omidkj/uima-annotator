Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status.
Failure to Thrive.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
85yo M with history of CAD, DM, PVD, dementia referred by PCP to
the [**Name9 (PRE) **] with altered mental status and failure to thrive.

The patient had a left AKA two months ago and has been
reportedly "not the same" since this operation. Per his wife, he
was depressed and "didn't speak much" prior to the operation,
but since the surgery has been increasingly confused. He was
discharged to home from the Rehab approximately 1.5 weeks ago
and over this time has had worsening mental status, primarily
moaning and saying "help me". His wife does note some confusion
at Rehab as well. He has had decreased po intake over this time
and has not taken solids or fluids for several days. His nursing
aid reports that over the past two days, he has been slumping to
the side in his wheelchair and had a recent fall from his
wheelchair and hit his head last Monday, [**10-17**]. No reported loss
of consciousness. His wife reports that he has had a 10-pound
weight-loss over the past two months. His wife and home health
aide deny that he has had cough, SOB, CP, diarrhea, melena,
BRBPR. The history was obtained primarily from ED records and
speaking with his wife and family members.

The pt was brought in by his wife on [**2196-10-23**] as he had
been losing weight and he had not eaten since d/c from Rehab.

ED course: the patient was noted to be moaning. Temp 99.8, BP
144/72 with HR 76. A UA was positive and he was started on
Levofloxacin and flagyl. GI was contact[**Name (NI) **] for guiaiac positive
stool and anemia. NG lavage in ED was negative for blood.
Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] for troponin of 0.14. Head CT negative
for acute bleed. He received 2L NS and 1U PRBC and was
transferred to the MICU.

continuously moaning once awake and answers questions with

Brief Hospital Course:
85M with history of CAD, DM, PVD, and dementia who was referred
by PCP to the [**Name9 (PRE) **] for altered mental status and failure to thrive
[**2196-10-23**]. Patient initially admitted to MICU with AMS, renal
failure, GI bleed and troponin leak and found to have Klebsiella
UTI and thought to be in urosepsis.  Patient later transferred
to the floor [**10-25**] where he had been stable until [**10-26**], when he
had an episode of hematemesis post attempted NGT placement and
was transferred back to the MICU for closer monitoring. Patient
transferred back to the floor [**10-27**] with stable HCT after blood
transfusions and no further upper airway bleeding.

1. Altered mental status: Pt continued to moan and mumble
incoherently, which according to his wife and caretaker had been
going on for at least 1.5 weeks, and possibly during his stay at
Rehab prior to that. This appears to be a somewhat subacute
process superimposed on chronic deficits, likely delirium
superimposed on underlying depression and dementia. Delirium was
thought to be likely related to urosepsis and uremia. TSH,
Vitamin B12 normal. Mental status did not improve much during
hospital stay and eventually declined [**2196-10-29**] with diminshed
response to painful stimuli.

2. Urosepsis: Pt with Klebsiella UTI and was hemodynamically
stable throughout hospital course.  Patient initially afebrile
but later began to spike fevers despite continued antibiotic
therapy (renally-dosed Levofloxacin) for his UTI while on the
floor.

3. Renal failure: Acute on chronic renal failure. Baseline
creatinine appears to be around 2.5, 7.9 at peak. Acute on
chronic renal failure of mixed etiology- likely a prerenal
component given decreased po intake over the last several weeks
and GIB, as well as ATN in setting of known UTI/Pyelnephritis,
given muddy brown casts and FENa of 4% on admission. Creatinine
improved minimally after fluid hydration and blood products on
admission. Renal US showed no hydronephrosis and simple cyst
left kidney.  Renal service was  following and initiated HD
[**10-26**].

4. GIB: The pt was found to have BRBPR at time of admission
along with a Hct of 25.4.  NG lavage in ED was negative
suggesting lower GI bleed.  The pt was transfused 2units of
PRBC.  The pt had not been tachycardic (although V-paced) or
hypotensive in the MICU.  After receiving 3 units of PRBC's over
24 hrs, pt's hematocrit was 34.5.  A colonoscopy was deferred
and the pt was managed conservatively.  Pt was manually
disimpacted and stool contained BRB as well as old blood. The
stool was very thick but not well-formed and quite dark.  Pt was
to undergo flex sig once determined to be stable.

5. Hematemesis: Most likely related to trauma of the upper
airway from the NGT in the setting of coagulopathy (INR 1.9)
causing bleeding [**2196-10-26**].  The patient
