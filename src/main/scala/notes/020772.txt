History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 66532**] is the mother of a physician in internal medicine
who works at the [**Hospital3 3765**]. Several months ago, she had
contracted a pneumococcal sepsis and was hospitalized for a
prolonged period of time in severe
condition with a very low-flow state. Fortunately, she was
resuscitated, but as a result of the prolonged low-flow
developed gangrene of both hands and both feet. She has
demarcated fairly well and is brought to the operating room
for removal of the just grossly nonviable tissue which was dry
and black, but not putrefied. She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] where she
was treated for ongoing medical problems. The recommendation
there was to do bilateral, both below-knee amputations
emergently. The family decided to wait. She is now admitted to
the [**Hospital1 69**] for conservative
debridements and salvage of as much viable tissue as possible.

Past Medical History:
Pneumonia, DIC, asthma, COPD, DIC ARDS, L pleural effusion s/p
tap, non-hogkins lymphoma, s/p splenectomy,


Social History:
Non contributory

Physical Exam:
On admision. Patient awake, alert and oriented x3.
Subtotal dry gangrene, both feet and both hands secondary to
prolonged low-flow state associated with pneumococcal sepsis.
