Chief Complaint:
Hematuria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
HPI-78 yo male with MMP as below incluiding ESRD s/p failed tx
on HD, ischemic CM with EF 20%, PVD, DMII who presented to OSH
with hematuria now being transferred for further management of
his chronic pleural effusion. Patient presented to OSH from NH
on [**4-22**] with hematuria. He was found to have an equivocal UA and
was discharged back to the nursing home for 14 day course of
Bactrim. He represented later that day so he was admitted. Foley
was placed and hematuria cleared with irrigation with hct
remaining stable with coumadin held. Cystoscopy was performed
this am which revealed and enlarged hyperemic prostate with
hemorrhagic bladder mucosa but no tumor. CXR on admission also
revealed known chronic left sided effusion which was aspirated
and found to be an exudate(serum) with glucose 282(321) LDH
110(152) and protein 3.4(6.3). Bactrim was discontinued due to
negative urine culture. Due to no available dialysis at [**Location (un) 620**]
and possible definitive treatment for his chronic pleural
effusion by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**], he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Pertinent Results:
[**2172-4-24**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Large left pleural effusion with lingular and left lower lobe
collapse.
2. Mild-to-moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema.
3. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2172-4-26**] RUQ U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of cholecystitis.
Anechoic foci in the left lobe of liver, likely hepatic cysts.
.
[**2172-4-28**]: The overall volume of the moderate left
hydropneumothorax is unchanged since [**4-25**] following surgical
procedure, but the fluid component has increased.  Lower lobe
atelectasis has worsened. Widespread interstitial abnormality in
the right lung is unchanged. Mild-to-moderate enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette is stable. Azygos distention indicates
elevated central venous pressure. No right pneumothorax. Tip of
the right supraclavicular dual channel catheter projects over
the superior cavoatrial junction.
.
[**2172-4-28**] Renal U/S: IMPRESSION:
 1. No evidence of obstruction.
 2. Slightly thickened bladder wall.
.
[**2172-4-29**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged moderate left hydropneumothorax and left lower lobe
atelectasis.
2. ET tube tip at the level of clavicles.
.
[**2172-4-30**] CT head: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Periventricular white matter hypodensities consistent with
chronic
microvascular ischemia.
.
[**2172-5-2**] MRI: IMPRESSION: No significant change since the
previous study. Moderate
ventriculomegaly indicating predominant central atrophy is again
seen. Mild- to-moderate changes of small vessel disease noted.
No acute infarct.
.
[**2172-5-6**] CXR:IMPRESSION: Persistent moderate left
hydropneumothorax.
.
[**2172-5-8**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Almost complete resolution of
pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube satisfactory.


Brief Hospital Course:
## Resp failure: Pt. initially came into hosptial w/ chronic
pleural effusions that were followed by IP (see below).  On
floor pt. w/ multiple episodes of tachypnea and difficulty
breathing w/ increased work of breathing.  on [**4-24**] pt. w/
increased work of breathing, but this improved after
thoracentesis.  On [**4-29**], pt. noted to be unresponsive w/ ? of
seizure activity, fever and hypotension.  At that time, concern
for respiratory process and ABG was performed 7.11/104/94.  Pt.
started to desat into the 80s.  At that time, anesthesia was
called and pt. was intubated for hypercarbic resp. failure and
transferred to MICU.  Pt. on vent and began to
oxygenate/ventilate well over the next few days.  Pt. w/
numerous gases that would suggest he could be extubated, but pt.
always tired out on PS and had poor NIFs.  Likely pt. very weak.
 Pt. had a h/o trach in the past and decision was made to have a
trach placed.  This occurred on [**5-8**].  The vent settings that
the patient left on remained:
CPAP+PS 12/5,  FIO2 of 0.4. Patient taking in tidal volumes of:
250-350.  Latest VBG: 7.36 pCO2
59 pO2
37 HCO3
35 BaseXS
5
 Patient is to be weaned at rehab as tolerated.
.
## Pleural effusions: Pt has known hemothorax s/p parietal
pleura decortication causing poor venous and lymphatic drainage.
This has been stable for an extending period of time and it is
not clear from documentation that he has become more
symptomatic. Labs of effusion suggest exudate but with his
multiple surgeries c/b his uremia there is no clear cause but it
does not appear to be empyema. On [**4-25**], IP performed a
paracentesis of L side w/ improved breathing - found that lung
ws trapped and no evidence of hydroptx.  This tap did NOT show
empyema and effusion may be due to uremic effusion.  Pt. w/ no
subjective complaints of dyspnea so decision was made by IP not
to performa pleuridex as pt. w/ a lot of comorbidities and pt.
not having dyspnea.
.
## MS changes/seizures:  Pt. w/ chronic altered mental status
secondary to vascular dementia, but had been oriented on the
floor.  Pt. also w/ seizure disorder history on dilantin.  Most
MS changes noted during dialysis or infections.  On [**4-29**], on
floor, pt. was noted to be unresponsive and had twitching of his
face.  Pt. was su
