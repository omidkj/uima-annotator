Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with deployment of drug eluting stents
in the RCA

History of Present Illness:
81 yo woman with H/O atrial fibrillation now s/p ablation,
hypertension and rheumatic fever who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for cardiac catheterization. Patient reports that on [**11-4**] at
5:30 am, she walked to the bathroom and noted a burning [**11-19**]
chest pain in the upper chest with radiation to the jaw. She
denies associated nausea, vomiting, dizziness, shortness of
breath, or diaphoresis. She took an Imdur with some improvement
in symptoms, called EMS and was taken to [**Hospital3 **]. On
arrival to [**Hospital1 **], she was noted to be in atrial fibrillation
with ventricular rates to 140s. She spontaneously reverted to
sinus rhythm.  At [**Hospital1 **], her initial troponin was negative but
subsequent troponin I was 5.0. Her INR was also noted to be
elevated at 3.9. She was given aspirin and Plavix and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization once her INR
normalized.

Of note, the patient had a myocardial perfusion study with SPECT
in [**9-20**] which showed apical ischemia that was medically managed.

On arrival to the floor at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was comfortable
and chest pain free. She denied any shortness of breath at this
time.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she denied any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denied recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denied exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems was notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ECG [**2142-11-5**]
Sinus bradycardia at 49 bpm. Diffuse low voltage. Consider prior
inferior myocardial infarction. No previous tracing available
for comparison. Clinical correlation is suggested

Echocardiogram [**2142-11-7**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis. Small circumferential
pericardial effusion.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2142-11-8**]
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated one vessel
coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a 20% stenosis. The
mid-LAD had a 30-40% stenos
