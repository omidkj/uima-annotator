Brief Hospital Course:
to OR [**2162-5-17**] for MV repair (26mm [**Doctor Last Name **] band) Weaned from vent
and extubated day of surgery.  Weaned off phenylephrine by POD #
1, transferred to telemetry floor on POD # 1.  Had low urine
output after transfer, with rising creatinine.  Trasferred back
to CSRU on morning of POD # 2, PA catheter placed, found to be
hypovolemic, treated with volume.  Also had PPM rate increased
to 80/minute to maximize cardiac output. Creatinine peaked at
1.9, but quickly reverted back down to normal (0.9-1.0 for past
4 days) after fluid resuscitation.
Anticoagulation resumed for atrial fibrillation, presently
V-paced at 70/minute (rate decreased to 70 on [**5-26**]).
She was not restarted on Altace due to elevatd creatinine (now
normalizeed), she was started on Norvasc.  This should be
re-evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 32548**] upon discharge from
