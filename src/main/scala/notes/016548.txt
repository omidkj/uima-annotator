TWO VIEW CHEST X-RAY dated [**2169-10-2**]

COMPARISON: [**2169-9-28**].

INDICATION: Status post coronary bypass surgery.

A right PICC line remains in place. The tip is difficult to
visualize on the PA projection, but appears to extend into the
proximal right atrium on the lateral view.

There has been prior median sternotomy and aortic and mitral
valvular surgery. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in
the postoperative period. Previously reported loculated left
hydropneumothorax shows further interval improvement with a
small residual peripheral hydropneumothorax remaining in the
left upper lung region. Adjacent poorly defined pulmonary
opacities in the left upper and midlung region appear slightly
improved as well as atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
Previously reported right apical pneumothorax has essentially
resolved. Small right pleural effusion and calcified bilateral
pleural plaques are again demonstrated.

IMPRESSION:

1. Resolving left hydropneumothorax. Resolution of right apical
pneumothorax.

2. Improving multifocal pulmonary opacities in the left lung,
which may be due to atelectasis. Resolving infection is also
possible if the patient is undergoing therapy for infection.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast in the
body of the LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%). [Intrinsic
LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of
valvular
regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Moderate global
RV free wall
hypokinesis. [Intrinsic RV systolic function likely more
depressed given the
severity of TR].

AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Complex
(mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve
leaflets. Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral
annular calcification. Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed tricuspid valve
leaflets. Severe
[4+] TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:

1. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity
of valvular regurgitation.] There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy.
2. The tricuspid valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic
pressure is normal. The right atrium is markedly dilated.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**11-21**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
4. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are
moderately thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The left coronary cusp is restricted in motion. No aortic
stenosis.
5. The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium.
6. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
moderate
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right
ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular
regurgitation.]
7. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(mobile) atheroma
in the descending aorta.
8. There is a small pericardial effusion.


POST-BYPASS:

Drips: Milrinone, epinephrine, phenylephrine.

1. Biopsrosthetic aortic valve is seen in good position. Good
leaflets opening
and coaptation. Trace central aortic regurgitation which is
appropriate for
this valve. No perivalvular leaks. Peak gradient across the
aortic valve is 22
mm Hg, mean of 14 mm Hg.
2. Moderate mitral regurgetation is seen.
3. Preserved left ventricular systolic function.
4. Right ventricular function is improved (mild RV hypokinesis)

5. Well placed tricuspid ring with mechanically stable tricuspid
valve.
Tricuspid valve leaflets open well with good coaptation point.
