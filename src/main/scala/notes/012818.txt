DIAGNOSIS: Left Parietal pleura, biopsy: Negative for malignant
cells.
Fibrosis, chronic inflammation, fibrin deposition and reactive
mesothelial hyperplasia.

[**2129-7-6**] Chest X-Ray intraperitoneal air decreased. Left chest
tube was removed.  There is no residual pneumothorax. Loculated
left pleural effusion is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is otherwise unchanged. Bibasilar opacity, probably due to
atelectasis are unchanged.

[**2129-6-24**] Chest X-Ray IMPRESSION: Interval reaccumulation of
moderate-sized pleural effusion on the left with loculated air
at the apex. The left lower lobe remains only partially
reexpanded.

[**2129-7-5**] Chest CT; 1. Worsening airspace consolidation
indicative of worsening pneumonia or possible hemorrhage.
Multifocal increased airspace opacity in both left lower lobe
and right middle lobe. Chest tube in place coursing through
pleural fluid collection with question largely unchanged from
previous study from CT [**2129-6-30**].
2. Decreased intraperitoneal free air as compared to CT from
[**2129-6-30**].
3. Mild gallbladder pericholecystic fluid and wall edema with
intraluminal
sludge.
4. Reactive lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules and lateral
chest wall
inflammatory changes, recommend followup CT once acute process
has resolved to
evaluate for interval course.

[**2129-6-30**] Chest CT: 1. Marked decrease in left pleural effusion
following decortication and placement of two left chest tubes,
with residual moderate partially loculated effusion. High
attenuation lenticular pleural collections in the lower left
hemithorax are suggestive of hemorrhagic fluid.
2. Small left apical hydropneumothorax and marked
pneumoperitoneum.
3. Expansion of left lateral chest wall musculature with
adjacent fluid and soft tissue stranding as well as high
attenuation foci of hemorrhage.
4. Numerous small lung nodules, with long-term stability of
right upper lobe nodules. Right lower lobe nodules are new since
[**2123**] and may be inflammatory, but attention to this area on
followup CT in three months is recommended to exclude neoplastic
nodules.
5. Widespread ground-glass attenuation and asymmetric septal
thickening,
possibly representing hydrostatic edema, but coexisting
infection should be considered, particularly given asymmetrical
areas of consolidation in the right upper lobe.

[**2129-7-5**] Echocardiogram:
IMPRESSION: No vegetations visualized but image quality
insufficient to exclude endocarditis given shadowing from aortic
prosthesis and mitral annular calcification. If clinically
indicated, a TEE would better assess for prosthetic valve
endocarditis. Preserved biventricular systolic function.
Mild-moderate mitral stenosis due to mitral annular
calcification.

[**2129-7-4**]: Abdominal Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of
two periportal hemangiomas. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of acute
cholecystitis. Gallbladder sludge is noted.





Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 284**] was admitted on [**2129-6-23**] following medical
pleuroscopy, during which 750 cc of serosanguineous fluid was
drained. There were no pleural abnormalities noted on
thoracoscopic evaluation. A postprocedure x-ray disclosed that
the lung did not expand and placement of a left chest tube.
Following the procedure she was admitted to the floor. Placed on
heparin for the mechanical [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1291**]. Thoracic surgery was
consulted and performed Left video assisted thoracoscopy
converted to left thoracotomy, decortication of lung, also
placement of pneumoperitoneum catheter.  Following the procedure
she remained intubated and was admitted to the SICU in stable
condition.

POD#1 she was extubated. Transferred to the floor with 2 left
chest tubes to LWS draing serosanguious fl
