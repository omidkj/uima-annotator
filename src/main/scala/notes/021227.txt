Allergies:
Ativan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left upper extremity AV fistula-gram


History of Present Illness:
60F w/ HCV, HTN, HL, ESRD s/p cadaveric transplant on
cyclosporine/cellcept presentes with dyspnea x 1 day. Patient
noticed increasesing dyspnea over the course of the day.
Althought this is not documented in recent discharge summary,
apparently patient has been using oxygen for the last month
since her most recent discharge, and using 2L while sleeping and
ambulating. Today her dyspnea was not responsive to oxygen. She
reports a mild nonproductive cough, worsening LE edema and
orthopnea without PND. She denies chest pain, fevers, chills,
palpitations and nausea. She has no sick contacts. Denies
[**Name2 (NI) **] noncompliance.
.
In the ED, patient was initially found to have a room air sat of
75% which came up with 5 L of oxygen to 88%. She was also found
to be hypertensive with systolics above 200.  BNP was 21,602
from an older value of 11,653 in [**Month (only) **]. CXR was consistent
with mild pulmonary edema. She was started on a nitro drip and
given lasix 40 mg IV x1. Initial cardiac enzymes were elevated
with a troponin of 0.13, with a baseline of 0.04 to 0.76 given
he renal function. EKG demonstrated lateral ST changes and an
old Q wave inferiorly. On transfer, VS were 99, 95, 229/79, 24,
and 95% on 4l.
.
Of note, patient was recently admitted [**3-21**] to [**2159-4-3**] for
seizures, complicated by aspiration pneumonia with parapneumonic
effusion and later acute on chornic renal failure. In regards to
partial seziure, this was felt to be secondary to cipro and/or
cylcosporin. Imaging and LP were negative. Cipro was stopped and
cyclosporine was decreased, and patient was discharged on
antiepeleptics. Patient was note to have right lobar
consolidation with associated effusion which was transudative,
and negative for infection and malignant cells, and was treated
with Piperacillin x 8 days. In regards to renal failure, Cr was
slightly elevated from baseline, but u/s unchanged and biopsy
complicated by perinephric hematomoa, but biopsy did not show
acute rejection, but did show chronic allograft nephropathy.
.
In the ICU, patient reports her dyspnea has improved but she now
has a headache since starting the nitro drip. She still denies
chest pain.
.

IMAGING:
[**4-24**] TTE: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. There is no valvular aortic
stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related
to high cardiac output. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2159-12-18**], pulmonary pressures are higher. The
other findings appear similar.

[**4-24**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Borderline P-R interval prolongation.
Poor R wave progression which is non-diagnostic. Non-specific
inferolateral ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2160-4-24**] there is no significant diagnostic change.

[**4-24**] CXR: Acute pulmonary edema; basal pneumonia not excluded.

[**4-24**] LUE Ultrasound: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the
left
