STEMI

History of Present Illness:
74 yo diabetic male with metastatic renal cancer involving the
lung and liver on avastin, prostate cancer, a history of PE, and
no known heart disease, presenting to [**Hospital1 18**] with 1 day of
non-specific fatigue and malaise subsequently found to have an
I-STEMI, and who now presents to the CCU s/p 2 BM stents to
ostial and distal RCA stensoses and intra-catheterization
vagally induced hypotension in the setting of acute kidney
injury.
.
He has felt unwell with fatigue and malaise since he underwent
CT-scan last Monday. Notes that he felt particularly unwell
Wednesday and that on Friday, the day prior to admission, he had
a presyncopal event, which he describes as feeling weak in the
legs while he was walking to the bathroom in his home; he lost
his balance and hit his forehead against the wall but did not
lose consciousness. He retired to bed, where he remained for the
rest of the day and awoke the day of admission with fatigue and
malaise. He went to church despite these symptoms, where he saw
the [**Doctor Last Name 23432**] nurse, who advised him to present to the ED. During
the interval between when he was presyncopal to when he
presented to the ED, he had no chest tightness or heaviness,
shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea, vomiting. He also
denies orthopnea, PND, or dependent edema. At baseline he can
climb 2 flights of stairs to his apartment without significant
exertional dyspnea.
.
In the ED, vitals were Temp:97.6 HR:74 BP:127/64 Resp:16
O(2)Sat:100 on RA. EKG showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in leads III and
AVF. Mild reciprocal ST depression in aVL and V3 Acute since
prior EKG. He was given ASA and loaded with Plavix, code STEMI
was called, and he was taken to the catheterization lab for
intervention.
.
In the lab, stenoses were appreciated in the viscinity of the
ostium of the RCA and in the distal RCA. A bare metal stent was
successfully deployed in each of the lesions; DES were deferred
in the setting of the patient's metastatic cancer and potential
bleeding risk on longterm anticoagulation. The procedure was
complicated by an episode of fluid responsive hypotension due to
vagal stimulation.
.
On the floor, vitals were Temp:98.3 HR:73 BP:172/55 Resp:24
O(2)Sat:100 RA. He continued on a renally dosed integrilin gtt
for 6 hours post cath and was started on medical management for
acute coronary syndrome with ASA 325, plavix 75, metoprolol 12.5
[**Hospital1 **], and atorvastatin 80. Afterload reduction was deferred given
his recent hypotension. Sheaths were pulled.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:

[**9-28**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrates two vessel disease. The right coronary artery has a

proximal 70 % stenosis, as well as a 99% lesion in the distal
RCA just
after the PDA bifurcation. The circumflex artery has a 60%
lesion
distally. The left main coronary artery and LAD are free of
angiographically apparent flow limiting disease.
2. Limited hemodynamics demonstrated mild hypotension that
responded to
one liter fluid bolus.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of distal RCA subtotal occlusion
with
2.0x18mm Mini Vision bare metal stent.
4. Successful direct stenting of proximal RCA lesion with
3.0x18mm
Vision bare metal stent postdilated to 3.25mm.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Systemic hypotension during the case, that responded to
intravenous
fluid bolus.
3. Acute inferior/posterior STE myocardial infarction.
4. Successful PCI of distal RCA subtotal occlusion with BMS.
5. Successful PCI of proximal RCA stenosis with BMS.

[**9-29**] Renal U/S: No acute renal pathology. No hydronephrosis.

[**9-30**] TEE at bedside:
A thrombus is suggested in the body of the right atrium. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = <20 %).
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis/akinesis. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Post-TPA infusion, there is no change.
These findings are suggetive of a primary pulmonary process
(e.g. pulmonary embolism), or a primary right ventricular
ischemia/infarction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Inferior STEMI: 74 yo diabetic male with metastatic renal cancer
involving the lung and liver on avastin, prostate cancer, a
history  of PE, and no known heart disease, presenting to [**Hospital1 18**]
with 1 day of non-specific fatigue and malaise subsequently
found to have an I-STEMI. He presented to the CCU s/p 2 BM
stents to ostial and distal RCA stensoses and
intra-catheterization vagally induced hypotension in the setting
of acute kidney injury. Presented with essentially no specific
symptomatology, noting instead to have 1 week of vague malaise
and fatigue punctuated by an episode of presyncope the day prior
to admission. CK/MB and Troponins were positive in the setting
of STE changes in the inferior leads with reciprocal changes
across the precordium; CKMB peaked the day of admission and was
low in comparison to the Troponins in absolute value, suggesting
that the STEMI was missed and may have occurred a week ago. The
etiology of the STEMI is thought to be a thromboembolic event
due to Avastin, which is known to put patients at risk for these
phenomena.
