CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval for pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old man s/p AVR CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pleural effusions

PROCEDURE: Chest PA and lateral on [**2108-3-14**].

COMPARISON: [**2108-3-12**].

HISTORY: 70-year-old man status post AVR and CABG, evaluate for
pleural effusions.

FINDINGS: In the interim, there is a gradual decrease in the
bilateral pleural effusions with gradual decrease in the
bibasilar lower lobe atelectasis. Persistent stable
cardiomegaly. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.

1. Gradual decrease in the bilateral bibasilar pleural effusions
which are small to moderate on today's examination along with
gradual decrease of the bilateral bibasilar lower lobe
atelectasis.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.

Conclusions
Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 10 - 15%). RV also with severe global
free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post- CPB: The patient is in SR, with infusions of milrinone and
epinephrine.
A well-seated and functioning aortic valve prosthesis is seen,
with no AI, and no perivalvular leak. Mean gradient is 15.
Aorta intact.
MR is 1+.
Biventricular systolic fxn is still moderately depressed.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to cardiac surgery. Carotid duplex showed Left
CCA stenosis of 80-99%, he was seen by vascular surgery. CT scan
showed very calcified aortic arch and carotid arteries and CEA
was recommended. He was seen by dentistry and tooth extraction
was recommended. He underwent 1 tooth extraction on [**3-4**]. On
[**3-8**] he was taken to the operating room where he underwent an
AVR, CABG x 3 and Left CEA. He was transferred to the ICU in
critical but stable condition on epinephrine, nitroglycerine,
and milrinone. He was extubated on POD #1. He was weaned from
his milrinone over several days and transferred to the floor on
POD #3. He required extensive diuresis. he was seen by [**Last Name (un) **]
for preoperative HbA1c of 9 and uncontrolled diabetes postop. He
was started on lantus and humalog sliding scale. He was seen by
PT and cleared for home over several days. He was ready for
discharge on POD #7.
