Admission Date:  [**2135-4-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2135-4-16**]

Date of Birth:   [**2075-12-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59 year-old female
with a past medical history of mitral regurgitation and
nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction
estimated to be about 10 to 15%.  The patient presented to an
outside hospital on the [**2135-4-4**] with a chief
complaint of chest pain.  At that time she was admitted to
the Intensive Care Unit and started on Lovenox, Integrilin
and aspirin.  The Intensive Care Unit team was unable to
start the patient on a beta blocker given her hypotension.
She had cardiac enzymes drawn with a peak CK in the 60s and a
troponin 1 that peaked at 0.41.  On the [**4-5**] the
patient complained of increasing shortness of breath and a
chest x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions.  The
patient was diurese as her blood pressure tolerated.  She was
started on a Dobutamine drip and transferred to another
outside hospital for further evaluation and catheterization.
The patient underwent a catheterization on the [**4-6**],
which revealed no significant coronary artery disease.  It
did, however, reveal she had elevated right heart pressures
with right atrial pressures of 18, 17, 15 and left heart
pressures with a wedge of 27, 29, 23.  Cardiac output of 2.37
with an index of 1.37.  The patient was found to have +4
mitral regurgitation with global hypokinesis.  An
echocardiogram was performed, which confirmed the results of
the catheterization and estimated her ejection fraction at
about 10 to 20%.  The patient remained on a Dobutamine drip
and was seen by the cardiac surgery team who recommended
further evaluation for possible heart transplant.  The
patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] on the [**4-10**] for an evaluation for a
heart transplant.

Upon arrival the patient was stable.  She had no chest pain,
shortness of breath, heart palpitations.  She denied
lightheadedness or dizziness.  She does report that at home
she has three pillow orthopnea.  She has limited physical
activity secondary to dyspnea on exertion and she denies any
recent weight changes or lower extremity edema.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient reports a significant alcohol
history up to five glasses of wine each day.  She denies any
tobacco use.  She is a retired secretary who lives at home
with her husband.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother passed away from an myocardial
infarction at the age of 57.  She has several maternal uncles
who also have passed away from an myocardial infarction at a
very young age.  She has a cousin with recent diagnosis of
idiopathic cardiomyopathy.

Catheterization results from the 11th revealed no significant
coronary artery disease, global hypokinesis with an left
ventricular ejection fraction estimated to be about 10 to
15%, 3 to 4+ mitral regurgitation.  Her pressures were her
right atrial was 18/17/15.  Her pulmonary artery pressures
were 42/25/33.  Her pulmonary wedge was 27/29/23.  Her left
ventricular was [**2120-12-24**].  Cardiac output was 2.37.  The
cardiac index was 1.31.  Her echocardiogram results were
ejection fraction of 10 to 15% with inferior posterior wall
hypokinesis, mitral valve regurgitation was estimated severe
3 to 4+, severe left ventricular dilation inferior wall and
apex hypokinetic in the apex akinetic.  Right ventricular
free wall severely hypokinetic.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a rate of about
100 beats per minute with frequent premature ventricular
contractions.  She had a normal axis.  She had a left
ventricular hypertrophy along with a left atrial abnormality,
normal PR/QRS and QT intervals.  There ST to T wave changes
consistent with left ventricular strain in leads V5 and V6.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 6.9,
hematocrit 43.  She had a platelet count of 254.  Her chem 10
showed a sodium of 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 103, bicarb
25, chloride 16, creatinine 1.3 and a glucose of 94.  Calcium
was 8.6, phosphate 3.0, magnesium 1.6.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Heart rate 109 beats per
minute, blood pressure 102/61 with a map of 71 on Dobutamine
drip.  Respiratory rate 16.  O2 sats were 96% on room air.
In general, this is a 59 year-old female who appears older
then her stated age.  She was well developed and well
nourished and in no acute distress.  Her pupils are equal,
round and reactive to light.  She had JVD to the ear.  There
was no lymphadenopathy.  The patient with poor dentition.
Her cardiac examination her point of maximal impulse was not
palpable.  She had a regular rate and rhythm with frequent
premature ventricular contractions.  She had 3 out of 6
systolic ejection murmur heard best at the left sternal
border.  Pulmonary examination she had positive egophony
bilaterally in the lower third of her lungs.  She had
crackles in the lower half bilaterally with the right greater
then left.  Her abdomen was obese.  She had positive
hepatomegaly approximately 3 cm below the sternum.  She had
positive bowel sounds.  Splenomegaly was not appreciated.
Her extremities were without edema, cyanosis or clubbing.
She had +2 dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  Neurological
she was alert and oriented times three.  Her short and long
term memory were intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII were
grossly intact.  There was no motor or sensory deficits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 59 year-old woman with
nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction
estimated to be about 15 to 20%.  She was transferred from an
outside hospital on a Dobutamine drip for cardiac support.
The patient was to be evaluated for possible cardiac
transplant.

1.  Cardiac wise:  A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed.  The
initial readings while on 2 micrograms per kilogram per
minute of Dobutamine were a pulmonary pressure systolic of 42
and diastolic of 22.  A CVP 9, cardiac output of 4.5 and
index of 2.5.  An SVR of 184 with a mixed venous of 62%.  She
was slowly weaned off Dobutamine and the Swan-Ganz numbers
remained consistent.  Due to her low ejection fraction the
patient was started on a heparin drip along with Coumadin.
Her fluids were restricted to approximately 1.5 liters per
day and she was gently diuresed as her blood pressure
tolerated.  She was started up on Digoxin also for her low
ejection fraction.  She was started on an ace inhibitor,
which was slowly increased during her stay.  Unfortunately
she was initially not able to tolerate a beta blocker given
her low blood pressure and this was not started until later
during her hospital stay.  The patient continued to improve
throughout her stay and the heart failure team felt she did
not need a cardiac transplant at this time especially given
her significant alcohol history.  Once stabilized off the
Dobutamine drip the patient was transferred to the floor
before being discharged to home.  The patient was seen by the
heart failure team and teaching was done about the patient's
reference her symptoms, proper diet, medications, symptom
management and exercise.  Material was given to the patient.
An appointment was set to follow up on the heart failure
clinic on the [**4-10**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

2.  Alcohol:  Patient with a significant alcohol history in
the past.  She was monitored on a CIWA scale.  She was
started up on thiamine and folate.  An addiction specialist
spoke to her and it was discussed the importance of absence
from alcohol following her di
