Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our NICU service for close
monitoring.  She was intubated and treated with IV labetolol to
control her blood pressures (keep it below 140 systolic).  Over
the course of the next several days, she became more alert as
the sedation was weaned and eventually was extubated without
incident.  A chest xray showed an infiltrate worrisome for a
pneumonia so she was begun on levofloxacin (this course will end
on [**2176-7-9**]).  She was titrated off of the iv anti-hypertensives
and titrated up on captopril, then ultimately switched to
lisinopril for once a day dosing.

Her neurologic exam now on the day of discharge is significant
for left sided weakness and a left hemi-neglect (both of these
have been improving).  She is now stable and ready for discharge
for to rehab for further physical therapy.
