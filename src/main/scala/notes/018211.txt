EKGs reviewed (as described below)

TTE: from [**3-16**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-7-14**], the
findings are similar.

Cardiac Catheterization [**12-6**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systemic hypertension.
3. Successful PCI of LCx with BMS
4. Successful PCI of RCA with BMS
5. Successful RRA TR band
6. [**Hospital 27416**] medical regimen.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo F with DM II, HTN, DL and CKD who presents after multiple
episodes of chest pain and SOB. Admitted initially for asthma
exacerbation but later found to have an NSTEMI and found to have
3VD on cath [**12-1**].
.
# CAD: S/P NSTEMI. Currently stable without CP. Received Cardiac
Catheterization with bare matal stents to left circumflex artery
and right coronary artery on [**12-1**]. She has done well post
catheterization with a resolving small hematoma on the left
radial site. She should have a full dose 325 mg aspirin and
Plavix 75 mg every day for at least one month and possibly
longer. she will also need to be on Atorvastatin 80 mg. Her
Lisnopril was restarted on [**12-8**]. Her beta blocker was held and
not restarted because of her severe asthma. She was rate
controlled with increased dose of long acting Diltiazem. She has
remained in a normal sinus rhythm. Her heart function is stable
with a preserved EF at 60-65%, no significant valvular
abnormality. She will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in cardiology here at [**Hospital1 18**]
in 1 month.
.
# ASTHMA EXACERBATION: History of Asthma with exacerbations
several times per year, but no history of intubations who
presents with 2 day history of worsening shortness of breath, no
URI symptoms, and intermittent chest pain. Started on standing
nebs and prednisone pulse in the MICU, now on prednisone taper.
Leukocytosis likely [**2-9**] prednisone. She has baseline DOE and
tight breath sounds with no audible wheezes on exam. She also
has a dry cough. Her Adviar dose was increased from home dose
and she has no O2 requirement (also no home O2)
.
# Diabetes Mellitus: She is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3617**] at [**Last Name (un) **] and
has had high insulin requirements, started on u500 insulin as
outpt. Her blood sugars have been labile and she will likely
need more insulin given prednisone. She was transitioned to
glargine with a humalog sliding scale.
.
# HTN: Currently well controlled on diltiazem and Lisi
