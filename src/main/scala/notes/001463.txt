carotid stenosis.

[**2130-1-3**] Echo: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. A tiny patent
foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No
thoracic aortic dissection is seen. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate/severe prolapse of the P1 portion of the posterior
mitral leaflet. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature
of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is also a central MR jet.
POST-CPB: There is a mitral annular ring in place. The anterior
mitral leaflet spans the entire mitral annulus, and the
posterior mitral leaflet is minimally visible, consistent with
mitral valve repair. There is no residual MR. The LV systolic
function appears unchanged from preop, estimated EF 50%. There
is no evidence of aortic dissection. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results at time of study.

PICC line has been inserted on the left and terminates in the
upper superior vena cava. A right jugular sheath has been
withdrawn. There is no other significant change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12667**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for admission prior to surgery for
cardiac cath and due to being on Coumadin at home for atrial
fibrillation. He stopped Coumadin prior to admission and was
started on IV Heparin. Following cath he was transferred to the
floor for medical management. In addition he underwent extensive
surgical work-up which included echo, carotid U/S, PFT's and
dental clearance. On [**2130-1-3**] he was brought to the operating
room where he underwent a mitral valve repair and coronary
artery bypass graft x 1. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. On post-op day one EP was consulted for
management of bradycardia, sinus pauses and atrial fibrillation
(brady-tachy syndrome). He remained in the CVICU for a week for
close rhythm monitoring and management. During this time he was
diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. Although pacing wires
remained intact for longer due to rhythm issues. Heparin,
eventually Coumadin, and Amiodarone were started for atrial
fibrillation. On post-op day seven he was transferred to the
stepdown floor for further care. On post operative day 8 his
rhythm was stable in atrial fibrillation at a rate 90-100's with
no required pacing for multiple days. His Heparin was stopped at
this time and pacing wires were pulled. Heparin was then resumed
6 hours later and stopped once patient became therapeutic on
Coumadin. During post-op period he worked with physical therapy
for strength and mobility.  On post operative day 9 he was
ambulating with assistance, his incisions were healing well and
he was tolerating a full oral diet.  It was felt that he was
safe for discharge to [**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 1294**]. He will
follow-up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks.
