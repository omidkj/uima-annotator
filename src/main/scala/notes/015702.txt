Arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness, in brief: 41-year-old male with past
medical history of patent foramen ovale s/p closure, PE on
lovenox, diastolic CHF, COPD, pulmonary hypertension, on home O2
at 4L NC (although patient states he was on room air prior to
admission) initially presented to [**Hospital3 10377**]
Hospital with 10/10 periumbilical pain associated with nausea,
vomiting, worse in the right lower quadrant. At that time he was
found to have an incarcerated hernia on imaging and admitted for
open repair of strangulated incisional hernia with mesh
placement, with some strangulated bowel requiring resection (end
to end connection). After the procedure he was transfered to the
ICU, where he was not able to be extubated for 2 days and
apparently developed aspiration pneumonia which was treated with
antibiotics (levofloxacin and metronidazole). He developed
atrial flutter after which he required both face mask and nasal
cannula to maintain oxygen saturations above 90% and required
cardioversion. Patient had difficulty being weaned of venti-face
mask with FiO2 of 50% with 5L NC. Pulmonary was consulted and
thought that the patient had severe pulmonary hypertension and
recommended transfer to tertiary care facility for further
pulmonary care. Surgically, patient has recovered and is
tolerating a regular diet, passing flatus and having normal,
soft bowel movements.

Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for severe pulmonary
hypertension with continued elevated O2 requirements. The
patient immediately triggered on the floor with an SaO2 of 88%
on 50% venti-face-mask and a temperature of 101.1. He was given
IV lasix 80mg, nebs, heparin drip continued, vancomycin and
zosyn for HAP/VAP/aspiration PNA, blood and urine cultures
obtained and MICU consulted and subsequent transfer initiated.

In the MICU the patient was maintained on a face mask. He had an
A-line placed and a TTE with bubble study, which showed a septal
occluder device in place without evidence of atrial septal
defect of patent foramen ovale. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with systolic function of EF>75%. Right ventricular
cavity is dilated with borderline depressed free wall motion.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
patient was started on a lasix drip and acetazolamide. A PICC
line was placed and a CTA was performed which showed possible
chronic pulmonary emboli and patchy ground glass opacities and
enlarged lymph nodes. The facemask was reduced from 50% to 40%
with stable SaO2s. The lasix drip was stopped with continued
diuresis by the patient. His sotalol was decreased to 40mg [**Hospital1 **],
however, HR increased to 130s and he continued his 80mg [**Hospital1 **]
dosing. The patient was deemed to be stable for general medical
floor treatment and was transferred.

[**2144-1-7**] CXR: Lung volumes are low, exaggerating the heart size.
Pulmonary and mediastinal vessels are dilated but there is no
pulmonary edema. Small left pleural effusion may be present.
[**2144-1-8**] TEE: The left atrium is elongated. A septal occluder
device is seen across the interatrial septum. No atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
borderline depressed free wall motion. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2144-1-12**] CTA chest: 1. Tiny filling defects in the distal
subsegmental branches of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally as
detailed above with an eccentric distribution, the imaging
findings of which are consistent with chronic pulmonary emboli;
however, the chronicity of this finding cannot be definitively
ascertained due to which an acute process is not entirely
excluded. 2. Bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities
predominantly in the upper lobes, left greater than right,
stable since [**2143-11-3**], could represent an
inflammatory/infectious process. 3. Mediastinal adenopathy,
stable since [**2143-11-3**]. Consideration to PET/CT should be
given for further evaluation. 4. Increased size of main
pulmonary artery measuring 3.7 cm consistent with pulmonary
arterial hypertension. 5. Small hiatal hernia. 6. Small amount
of fluid in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen with
nonvisualization of spleen, correlate for history of
splenectomy. 7. Mild fatty infiltration of liver.
[**2144-1-19**] RUQ U/S: Anterior abdominal wall paramedian fluid
collections at the superior aspect of the incisional scar
measuring up to 7.6 cm on the right and 7.4 cm on the left.
