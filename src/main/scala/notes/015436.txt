Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is 47yo M, with metastatic RCC who is well known to
OMED service, and was discharged within the last week following
a presentation for pleursy.  Work-up revealed CT findings
concerning for CAP and a small-moderated pericardial effusion
thought to be malignant.  Also had associated chest pain and rub
consistent with pericarditis.  Has improved on NSAID therapy.
Who presented to clinic yesterday ([**2-10**]) for routine follow-up
and to have final radiation therapy to left acetabulum
metastases.  After his radiation therapy, he proceeded to have
his labs drawn.  During blood draw he became pale, diaphoretic
and had brief LOC without evidence of seizure.  He was then
trasnferred to the ED where he was noted to have mild
leukocytosis with fever to 101.  CT chest revealed new
epicardial mets and multiple pulmonary nodules. Bedside ECHO
showing effusion, no tamponade.  Was treated presumptively with
Vanc, cefepime, flagyl and levoflox.  Hct dropped with hydration
and he was transfused 1u PRBC for concern of unstable blood
volume.

Was initially admitted to the ICU for brief hypoxic episode to
86%/RA and concern of hypotension in ED (none in documentation).
 Has gotten his infleunza vaccine.  Does have a h/o asthma.
While in the ICU, he was continued on levofloxacin and flagyl
for presumptive flagyl.  The following day he was transferred
back to the OMED service.  Upon arrival to floor he confirms no
SOB, or difficulty breathing.  Denies any further pleursy and
think pain is [**3-17**] and well controlled.  Otherwise denies any
new complaints and confirms vago-vagal episodes with blood draws
in the past.  getting

His primary oncologists are Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He is
now getting ready to start Sutent (chemo ordered, not yet
recieved).

ROS: Negative except for as above, improving cough since last
presentation.  Additionally confirms anorexia, early satiety &
20lb weight loss in last several months.

Past Medical History:
1.  Seizure disorder, diagnosed in [**2112**], last seizure in [**2128**].
2.  Status post right laminectomy.
3.  H/o asthma

Oncologic history:
He reports that he began to feel unwell in 09/[**2137**].  At that
time, he developed left leg and hip pain, early satiety, night
sweats, and a 0-pound weight loss over the ensuing two to three
months.  He finally  sought evaluation in [**1-/2138**], at the office
of his primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] that time, an MRI of the
spine was performed on [**2138-1-10**].  This study demonstrated
postsurgical changes at L4-L5 with a small right recurrent disc
protrusion.  New small left foraminal protrusion was noted at
L3/L4.  There was an abnormal process at the retroperitoneum,
which included retroperitoneal adenopathy and abnormal soft
tissue infiltrating the right perinephric space and right
kidney.  Given the findings of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy
on his MRI, he was sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for evaluation in the
[**Hospital 3242**] clinic.  Due to his severe discomfort of the leg and back
and his difficulty walking, he was admitted to the BMT service.
His inpatient evaluation included a urine cytology analysis,
which demonstrated atypical urothelial cells.  In addition, he
underwent a CT scan of the torso on [**2138-1-21**], which
demonstrated a right upper pole renal mass, xtending to the
renal hilum and through the retroperitoneal space posteriorly
(6.1 x 6.9 x 8.9 cm).  Adenopathy was seen in the aortocaval and
retrocaval spaces.  This was seen in the setting of innumerable
pulmonary nodules, right hilar lymph node, and destructive left
acetabular mass.  These findings were felt to be most suggestive
of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and were felt to be an
unusual manifestation for lymphoma.  It was felt that, given
that destruction of the osseous portion of the left acetabulum,
the patient was at high risk for pathologic fracture in the
weightbearing setting. On [**2138-1-22**], a core biopsy of the
patient's acetabular mass was obtained demonstrating carcinoma,
consistent with renal origin. Immunophenotypic analysis of the
tissue was nondiagnostic.  An
MRI of the abdomen was performed on [**2138-1-25**], which
demonstrated a large heterogeneously enhancing mass within the
right kidney.  Imaging characteristics were suggestive of a
clear cell subtype.  There was suggestion of invasion of the
posterior musculature and question of diaphragmatic involvement
with abnormal enhancement and thickening of the diaphragm as
detailed above.  The right renal vein was patent.  There was
evidence of metastatic disease with an acetabular lesion on the
left, pulmonary nodules at the lung bases, and significant
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There was also suggestion of
abnormal enhancement involving a nodular appearing apex of the
right adrenal gland.  The patient was evaluated by the urology
team, and a debulking nephrectomy is planned for [**2138-2-18**].

Social History:
Immigrated from The Azores in [**2104**].  The patient is married and
lives in [**Hospital1 1474**].  He was previously a heating and air
conditioning technician, who owns his own business.  He has a
23-year-old daughter and a 20-year-old son, who has recently
given birth to his first grandchild.  He previously smoke 1ppd
for 31 years, quit [**1-21**].  He formally drank one glass of
wine per night and no longer drinks alcohol.  He has a history
of occasional marijuana with last use [**2138-1-7**].  He has no
history of cocaine or intravenous drug use.


Family History:
The patient's father is 75 and has a history of prostate cancer,
diagnosed seven to eight years ago.  His mother is 73 and has
hypertension.  He has four brothers and six sisters, all of whom
are well to his knowledge.
