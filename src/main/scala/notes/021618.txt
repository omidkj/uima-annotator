Cardiac Echo:  [**3-4**]
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15
%). Two large thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. One
appears to be adherent to the inferior wall and apex and
measures 2.9cm x 2cm. The other is near the anterior apex and
measures approximately 1.5cm x 1.7cm. Neither appears to be
mobile. The age of the thrombi cannot be determined by
echocardiogram. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated, severely hypokinetic left ventricle with
two large left ventricular thrombi. Mild mitral regurgitation
and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2186-10-19**], the left ventricle is more dilated and
probably more hypokinetic. The left ventricular thrombi were not
seen on the prior echo (given their size, it is unlikely that
they were present and not seen).

Cardiac Echo [**2187-3-19**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated. A moderate sized thrombus is seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated, severely hypokinetic left ventricle with a
left ventricular thrombus.
