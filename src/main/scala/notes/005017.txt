Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with stent placement.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old gentleman with a history of hypertension,
tobacco abuse, with history of coronary artery disease,
status-post cath in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year for a Non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) at [**Hospital3 17921**] Center where
he was found to have a 100% LAD, 100% RCA and 90% LCx. His
Ejection Fraction was 40%. He was referred to cardiac surgery
who deemed him too high of a surgical risk. He underwent
pulmonary consultation as well and was started on Xopenex and
inhalers. He suffered a Cerebral vascular accident (CVA) while
hospitalized and CT scan reportedly showed evidence of infarct
though neurological consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73987**] reports no
left brain lesions on CT scan and he felt the patient had a
subcortical stroke. The patient was the discharged home.

He was admitted to Lakes [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital on [**2139-7-31**] by EMS with
severe wheezing. Apparently he has been having daily episodes of
chest discomfort and taking [**5-2**] nitroglycerin tabs per day. He
ruled out for a MI and has been on nebulizer treatments and
nitropaste. He continues to have chest discomfort requiring NTG
sublinqual for relief.

Vital Signs on arrival: BP 129/62; HR 60-75; SR with 1st degree
block; T 36.3; O2 sat 93% on RA.

The patient reports no nausea or diaphoresis. His shortness of
breath has worsened in the last few months. He states he was
once able to walk over 500 ft but now cannot walk down the [**Doctor Last Name **].
There is no history of PND, orthopnea, presyncope, syncope, or
palpitations.

Carotid Ultrasound [**2139-8-6**]:
IMPRESSION: Bilateral 40-59% ICA stenosis. Resistive left
vertebral waveform.

ECHO [**2139-8-10**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with with severe hypokinesis of the
inferior septum, basal half of the inferolateral wall, and
distal inferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aorta.

Vein Mapping [**2139-8-10**]:
FINDINGS: The greater saphenous veins are patent bilaterally.

CT abdomen [**2139-8-12**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.7 cm.
2. Scattered colonic diverticula without evidence of
diverticulitis.
3. Bowel containing bilateral inguinal hernias; small bowel on
the right and colon on the left. No evidence of bowel
obstruction.
4. Atherosclerosis.

Cardiac cath [**2139-8-14**]:
COMMENTS:
1- Limited selective angiography confirmed severe diffuse CAD.
The LMCA had 30% stenosis. The LAD was occluded proximally. The
LCX was a calcified vessel and had 90% proximal stenosis with
severe diffuse serial disease throughout the vessel. The LCX was
the only patent vessel and supplied the whiole myocardium. The
RCA wa known occluded and not engaged.
2- Successful insertion of IABP and balloon-tipped pacer wire
catheter for support during this high-risk angioplasty.
3- Limited resting hmodynamic asessment was performed using an
MPA-1 catheter and revealed PA pressure of 34/14/24 mmHg. [**Doctor First Name **]
systemic artrial pressure 109/53 mmHg.
4- Left ventriculography was deferred.
5- Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LCX with a
2.5x12 mm Xience [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 79506**] to 2.5 mm. Final angiography
revealed 10% residual stenosis  with TIMI III flow and no
dissection or distal emboli.
6- Unsuccessful attempt to revacularize a chronically occluded
LAD.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LCX with a DES.
3- Unsuccessful attempt to revascularize the chronically
occluded LAD.
4- Remove IABP (left femoral artery), arterial sheath (right
femoral artery) and venous sheath (right femoral vein) once ACT
< 180 sec.
5- Minimum of 12 months of Plavix and lifelong ASA.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 78 year old gentleman with a history of
hypertension, tobacco abuse, history of Coronary Artery Disease
(CAD), status post cath in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year for a NSTEMI with
three vessel disease sent here for further evaluation.

The patient present with Chronic/Stable Systloic
Dysfunction/Heart failure. He was found to have severe three
vessel disease. In addition, due to his Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary disorder, there was a concern as to whether he would
be a good candidate for bypass surgery (CABG). Pulmonary
function testing showed FVC and FEV1  approximately 50% of
predicted. ECHO showed LVEF of 40%, normal biventricular cavity
sizes with regional left ventricular systoli
