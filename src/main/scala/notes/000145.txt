Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2164-4-6**] - Coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels. (Left
internal mammary->left anterior descending artery, saphenous
vein graft(SVG)->Ramus artery, SVG->Obtuse marginal artery,
SVG->Posterior descending artery.)

History of Present Illness:
68 year old male admitted to Caritas [**Hospital3 **] ED with
complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath, where he was
intubated and underwent diagnostic cardiac catheterization and
is transferred here for management of his coronary artery
disease. Per records, patient complained to his wife chest
discomfort at 4:45 AM and drove himself to the emergency room.
Chest pain was described as [**9-24**] non-pleuratic substernal
discomfort radiating into left shoulder and arm and associated
with shortness of breath. He received aspirin and sublingual
nitroglycerin PO in the ED initially. He was noted to be
progressivel dyspneic and then required furosemide 20mg IV,
morphine 4mg IV and initiation of nitroglycerin gtt, and
metoprolol 5mg IV x 3, and was subsequently intubated due to
dyspnea. Initial ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 115 with LBBB
and no prior for comparison. TnI was 1.04 (normal 0.00-0.49)
with CPK 182 and MB of 15.2. He initially went to the ICU, where
he received clopidogrel 500mg x 1, and started on heparin gtt
with 4500 unit bolus. He was transferred to cardiac
catheterization laboratory and underwent left and right heart
catheterization showing RCA and LCx occlusion, 50% LMCA lesion,
and 90% pLAD stenoses with elevated left-sided filling
pressures. He was transferred on heparin gtt to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management. Of note, patient was also ordered for
empiric Vancomycin and ceftriaxone and had already received
ceftriaxone prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to CCU, patient was intubated, but awake, alert, and
in NAD. JVP was 10cm and chest x-ray did not demonstrate
pulmonary oedema. Patient was extubated without event. Initial
laboratory evaluation showed markedly elevated CPK and patient
was started on eptifibatide in addition to heparin.  Cardiac
surgery is now evaluating for surgical resvascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2164-4-2**] Carotid Ultrasound
Mild atherosclerotic plaque with bilateral 1-39% ICA stenosis.
Antegrade vertebral flow bilaterally

[**2164-4-6**] ECHO
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %). with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 81180**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2164-4-1**] for further
management of his myocardial infarction and coronary artery
disease. As his enzymes were trending downward, integrillin was
stopped. He was worked up by the cardiac surgical service in
preparation for revascularization. A carotid duplex ultrasound
was obtained which revealed only mild bilateral internal carotid
artery disease. Pulmonary function testing was performed given
his heavy smoking history. His forced expiratory volume in the
first second was diminished at 2.73L or 68% predicted. A dental
consult was obtained in anticipation of surgically addressing
his mitral regurgitation. After a panorex was obtained, Mr.
[**Known lastname 81180**] was cleared for surgery from an oral standpoint. On
[**2164-4-6**], Mr. [**Known lastname 81180**] was taken to the operating where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels.
Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively he was
taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring.  By POD 1, the
patient was extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  He was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable, off all vasoactive drips.   Chest tubes and pacing wires
were discontinued without complication.  The physical therapy
service was consulted for strength and mobility.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor on POD 3. His blood
sugars were well controlled on his home dose of metformin 1000mg
two times per day.  By post-operative day five he was ready for
discharge to home with continued lasix.
