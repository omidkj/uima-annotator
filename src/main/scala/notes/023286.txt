History of Present Illness:
45 year old woman with h/o asthma was well until two weeks prior
to admission when she noted a "cold." She developed nasal
congestion, rhinorrhea, cough with green sputum, and mild
shortness of breath with exertion. She took albuterol initially
with good response. Over the two weeks prior to admission, the
albuterol became increasingly ineffective. Her baseline peak
flow is around 450. By the time of admission, her peak flow was
near 200. She noted taking albuterol greater than four times a
day, but noted no relief. At that point, she came to the
emergency department.

The normal triggers for her asthma are URIs, pollen, mold, and
hot weather. Of note, she recently got a cat due to a rodent
problem at her home. She has had a cat previously without any
difficulty, but notes this cat has more hair.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Asthma: Patient was admitted with asthma exacerbation. Her
trigger appears to be a URI, although her new cat is another
possibility. She was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU given her low
peak flows. She was initially started on po prednisone, but then
switched to IV solumedrol given a lack of improvement. She also
received albuterol nebs q2h. After three days, her SOB improved
and her Peak Flows rose to high 200s, low 300s. She was then
called out to the floor where her peak flows were stable in the
300s.  At discharge, the patient's peak flow was 330.  On [**6-28**],
she was started on fluticosone and singulair (which she reported
taking in the past at home), both of which seemed to help her
respiratory status.  A discussion was held with the patient
regarding seeking medical attention as an outpatient regarding a
possible allergy to cat dandruff as well as the possibility of
needing a nebulizer at home.  It was decided that she needed
both of these options and the patient will make arrangements in
order for both to come to fruition.  The patient was also
advised to attempt quitting smoking as smoking can exacerbate
symptoms of asthma.

2. Steroid Induced Diabetes: patient was noted to have elevated
fingersticks once starting the steroids. She has a family
history of Diabetes and is obese. She was maintained on a
insulin sliding scale during her admission. She will be
discharged home off insulin but on metformin for the duration of
her steroid taper.  She will need to have close follow up with
her primary care physician to screen for Diabetes when off
steroids.

3. ?Gastritis: the patient had one episode of vomitting on the
evening of [**6-28**].  According to the patient, nausea began around
[**12-28**] am while lying in bed.  She felt "all her medicine churning
around" and vomitting non-bilious fluid once.  She attributed
the vomitting to gastritis which had not completely resolved 1.5
weeks before presentation.  There were no other episodes of
vomitting during her hospital course.
