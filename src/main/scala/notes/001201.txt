Shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20741**] is an 84 yo M with COPD (not on home oxygen),
asbestos exposure, OSA, and CAD s/p CABG (LIMA->LAD) in [**2144-4-21**]
who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with acute onset shortness of
breath and R sided chest pain. The patient has been hospitalized
multiple times over the past month. Briefly, the patient
underwent elective minimally invasive, endoscopic CABG on
[**2144-4-21**] after experiencing worsening exertional chest pain. His
hospital course was complicated by the need to return to the OR
for re-exploration of his chest for bleeding after increased
chest tube output was noted, and a L sided pleural effusion,
have an increased oxygen requirement at that time that was
unable to be weaned. He was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for
cardiac rehab on [**4-29**]. The patient re-presented on [**5-6**] with
fever and abdominal pain and diagnosed with acute cholecysitis.
He was deemed a poor surgical candidate, so a perc chole was
placed on [**5-8**], capped on [**5-15**] due to poor drainage through
cystic duct noted on T-tube cholangiogram, and he completed a 10
day course of cipro/flagyl (completed on [**5-17**]). This hospital
course was c/b an acute stroke on [**5-12**] where the pt experienced
decreased sensation on the right upper extremity which was
improving, as well as a right field cut, a right upper motor
neuron hemiparesis, and a right hemisensory deficit.  His Head
CT and MRI showed acute infarctions in the left occipital lobe,
left thalamus, left cerebellar hemisphere and right superior
cerebellum. TEE on [**5-15**] negative for left atrial thrombus. The
etiology was thought to be cardioembolic, and lifelong
anticoagulation was recommended with coumadin. He was discharged
to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**5-15**] to complete his heparin bridge to
coumadin.

Per discussion with the family, the patient was progressing well
at rehab over the past few days, although he has had an new
oxygen requirement (minimal 2-3 L NC) since his CABG. Last
Saturday, the patient was noted to walk 250 feet and
experiencing only mild SOB. Over the weekend, he developed a low
grade fever, and [**Name8 (MD) **] MD notes was noted to be hypoxic to 86% on
RA (improved to 95% on 2L). CXR at rehab showed multiple scars,
patchy bilateral radio-opacities, and evidence for pleural
thickening with fluid on the left. Yesterday, around 4 pm, one
of his family members also noted that he was back on oxygen at
the rehab and was a bit more lethargic than usual, and
perseverating. He also developed a new leukocytosis. (10.4 on
[**5-16**] ->21.0 on [**5-19**]). On the morning of admission, the patient
endorsed R sided pleuritic chest 'tightness' and 'inability to
catch his breath.' Hewas given lasix 20 mg IV x1, started on a
heparin gtt, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.

In ED VS were 99.7 85 112/49 21 95% on 3 L. His labs were
significant for a WBC of 23.1 with a left shift, plt of 691, CK
15 Trop-I < 0.01, INR of 2.3. EKG without new ischemic changes.
CTA Chest showed no evidence of PE, but worsening BL pleural
effusions with evidence of loculation, pneumonia could not be
excluded. T-tube test of perc chole showed patent flow. Bedside
U/S per report showed no pericardial effusion. CT surgery was
consulted and did not think his pleural effusions were
significantly larger than before, and recommended no emergent
surgical intervention. He was given Vancomcyin 1 gram IV x1 and
Zosyn 4.5 grams IV x1, combivent nebs x1, and 2 L NS. Lactate
trend was 2.4-> 1.2 ->0.9. Patient was admitted to the medicine
floor.

Per report from ED resident to floor medicine resident Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1022**], patient appeared comfortable on nasal cannula
alone. When the patient arrived to the floor, he was noted to be
tachypneic to the 30s and on 12 L ventimask. His oxygen
saturations on 2 L NC was 84%. ABG was 7.45/34/65. MICU resident
was consulted for transfer to MICU for further monitering given
hypoxia, increasing oxygen requirement. His VS were 34, 88
119/50 94% 6 L NC + 50% venti face mask prior to transfer to the
ICU.

On the floor prior to transfer, the patient was AOx2 (name,
'[**Hospital1 18**]'). He stated his breathing was more 'shallow' than
normal. Denied any chest pain or abdominal pain. He is unable to
bring up any sputum with his coughing.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent
change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied
arthralgias or myalgias.
