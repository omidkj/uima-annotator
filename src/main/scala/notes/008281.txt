Chief Complaint:
ICD shocks x 17 today

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 86 yoM w/ a h/o infarct related cardiomyopathy
and an EF of [**9-10**]% and VT s/p VT ablation and placement of
BiV-ICD + intrathroacic impedence monitor (optivol), atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, CKD, also new diagnosis of multiple
myeloma a few weeks ago presents to ER (initially OSH ER then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER) for 17 shocks today. His most recent
PPM interrogation revealed an increase in ventricular ectopy and
85 episodes of VT w/ rates 180-190 all successfully treated with
ATP. At this visit he was noted to be mildly volume overloaded
and his lasix dose was increased.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ER initial VS were: T 97.2 HR 69 BP 101/60 RR 16 O2
sat: 98% on RA. The patients ICD was interrogated by the
cardiology fellow on call who stated it appears all shocks were
appropriate therapies for VT. The patient was given a 150mg IV
bolus of amiodarone and admitted to the CCU. VS prior to
transfer to the CCU were: HR 70 BP 109/65 RR 18 O2 sat 100% on
RA.

Currently feels well, no syncope, no lightheadedness, no SOB, no
DOE, no orthopnea or PND, no chest pain. no fevers / chills. In
general has felt more weak over past 1 month. no numbness or
paresthesias in lower extremities.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 year old male with infarct related cardiomyopathy, EF of
[**9-10**]% and VT s/p VT ablation and placement of BiV-ICD +
intrathroacic impedence monitor (optivol), atrial fibrillation
on coumadin, CKD, also new diagnosis of multiple myeloma a few
weeks ago admitted after having 17 ICD shocks.

1. Ventricular tachycardia s/p ICD shocks.  His runs of
sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia
subsided once he was amiodarone loaded.  He will be discharged
on amidoarone 400 mg po BID for 13 more days and taper to 200 mg
po qdaily thereafater.

2. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: LVEF of [**9-10**]%. CABG in [**2101**] with
LIMA to LAD and SVG to OM. DES to Lcx in [**2113**].  He was not on
antiplatelet therapy so aspirin 325 mg po qdaily was started.
He was continued on metoprolol succinate 25 mg po qdaily.  He is
not on ACE-I likely due to rise in his creatinine from baseline
due to multiple myeloma.  He is also not on statin as well but
probably appropriate given his age and comorbidities.  He was
continued on home lasix 80 mg po qam and 40 mg po qpm.  His
metalozone was switched to 2.5 mg QOD.

3. Atrial fibrillation. INR supratherapeutic on admission.
Restarted coumadin at lower dose of 1 mg po qdaily especially in
setting of starting amiodarone. Will follow up with PCP this
week for INR check. Continued on metoprolol XL 25 mg po qdaily
for rate control. Discharged on amiodarone 400 mg po BID for
rhythm control for 13 more days and taper to 200 mg po qdaily
thereafter.  Will follow up with EP in one month.

4. Multiple Myeloma. Patient reports having had workup started
as outpatient with bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry with
oncologist at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 745**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 18650**]. Follow up with oncologist.
