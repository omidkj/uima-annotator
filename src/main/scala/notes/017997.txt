CT C spine: no fracture or dislocation. normal spine.
CT head: no acute abnormality
CT C/A/P
1. Minimally displaced manubrial fracture.
2. Multiple pulmonary contusions, most prominent in the right
middle lobe. In the right lower lobe, at the level of T6, is a
cyst which could represent a lung laceration.
3. Stranding of the fat on the left lateral abdominal wall,
incompletely
visualized. Recommend clinical evaluation for possible injury to
the soft
tissues at the site.
4. No evidence for traumatic injury to the aorta, or solid
intra- abdominal organs.

L Tib/Fib:
1. Comminuted fracture at the lateral aspect of the lateral
plateau.
2. Non-displaced fracture through the lateral tibial plateau.
3. Lipohemarthrosis within the knee joint.
4. Possible tiny medial tibial plateau fracture.

L forearm:
There is fracture of the ulnar shaft. The fracture
fragments are transfixed in good anatomic alignment by a slotted
plate and six screws. Cortical margins appear otherwise intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 84125**] presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2159-2-9**] via [**Hospital **]
transfer from the scene.  He was evaluated by the orthopaedic
and trauma surgery services and found to have Right sided
anterior pulmonary contusions, a left proximal tibia shaft
fracture with lateral tibial plateau fracture, a left fibula
shaft fracture, a left ulnar shaft fracture, and a right thumb
palmar laceration which was superficial.  He was admitted to the
trauma service initially, consented, and prepped for surgery.
Later that day he was taken to the operating room.  When he was
intubated he had immediate desaturation, the ETT was exchanged
over a bougie and saturation improved.  Chest x-ray revealed a
RUL collapse.  Surgery was canceled and he was transferred to
the T/SICU for further monitoring.  On [**2159-2-11**] he was taken to
the operating room and underwent an ORIF of his left tibia,
ulnar, and an I&D of his right thumb laceration.  He tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred back to the T/SICU.  He
was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells due to
acute blood loss anemia with improvement but required 2 units
again on [**2159-2-14**].  He had sputum samples taken in the ICU which
revealed strep pneumo so he was started on ceftriaxone.  This
was changed to levofloxacin for discharge.  His pulmonary
symptoms had improved at the time of discharge and he was
afebrile after [**2-15**].  On the floor he was seen by physical and
occupational therapy to improve his strength, mobility, and
function.  He was also seen by chronic pain service to help with
his pain control.  He was discharged in stable condition.
