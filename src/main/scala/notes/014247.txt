HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
woman with a history of asthma who was originally admitted to
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**11-1**] with a 24-hour history
of severe upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting which
was evaluated by ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen.  On
admission to the hospital with elevated lipase, amylase,
bilirubin, and ultrasound results significant for gallstones.
A CT scan of the abdomen revealed pancreatitis with poor
perfusion of the neck of the pancreas.  She was initial
treated on the surgical floor; however, she had some
respiratory distress requiring transfer to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  She was treated aggressively, however,
not requiring intubation.  On admission, she was started and
continued throughout her admission on Unasyn.  A follow-up CT
scan of the abdomen on [**11-4**] showed progression of the
pancreatitis with a marked decrease of visualization in the
body of the pancreas, consistent with necrosis.  On hospital
day five she began to become febrile at which time another CT
scan of the abdomen was performed which showed a necrosis of
the neck and body of the pancreas, enlarging intra-abdominal
fluid, peripancreatic fluid with enhancing rim, and large
pleural effusions.  She was started on hyperalimentation
peripherally and then converted to central total parenteral
nutrition.

She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] where she had persistent fevers, worsening abdominal
pain, and the above-mentioned CT results.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history was significant
for)
1.  Asthma.
2.  A tonsillectomy.
3.  Right inguinal hernia.

ALLERGIES:  She had no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission, the
person dictating was not the person who initially examined
the patient; however, the patient was found to be febrile
with a temperature of 101.3, blood pressure of 128/61, heart
rate of 107, respiratory rate of 18, oxygen saturation of 94%
on room air.  She was alert and conversant with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**]
Coma Scale of 15 and anicteric sclerae, pink conjunctivae,
moist mucous membranes.  No jugular venous distention.  Lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally, decreased breath
sounds at the bases.  She had a soft, obese, and tender
abdomen which was tender in the epigastrium with positive
rebound, positive cough tenderness, positive shake
tenderness, and positive bowel sounds.  On rectal examination
she was heme-negative.  No mass was palpate, soft stool,
positive external hemorrhoids.  She had no clubbing, cyanosis
or edema, and her pulses were palpable bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Her laboratories on
admission were white blood cell count 17.1, hematocrit 33,
platelets 390; 81% neutrophils, 6% bands.  Sodium of 133,
potassium of 4.4, chloride of 98, bicarbonate of 31, BUN
of 13, creatinine 0.4, glucose of 284.  PT was 13.2, PTT
was 24.1, INR of 1.2.  AST 39, ALT 50, alkaline
phosphatase 107.  Calcium 7.6, magnesium 1.6, phosphate 2.5,
albumin 2.3, total bilirubin 1.1, amylase 1.4.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   CT scan as above.

Chest x-ray showed large bilateral effusions and positive
central line in the superior vena cava.  No pneumothorax.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the hospital to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit and started on vancomycin,
ciprofloxacin, Flagyl, as well as continued on total
parenteral nutrition.  She had pan cultures.  She was started
on a insulin sliding-scale, and her electrolytes were
repleted.

The patient did well and was transferred out of the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit to the floor.  On the following day,
[**11-10**], the patient did well on the floor.  She required
oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations above 92%.  She was
given some albuterol nebulizers and was started on
meter-dosed inhaler albuterol inhaler which improved her
sensation of shortness of breath, and her oxygen saturations
quickly improved.  She was kept n.p.o. and on total
parenteral nutrition allowing for the inflammation within her
pancreas to resolve.  Her vital signs remained stable
throughout her hospital course.

On [**11-16**], total parenteral nutrition was stopped, and
she was started on clear liquids and was tolerating them
without any abdominal pain.

On [**11-17**] she began tolerating a soft regular diet, and
on [**11-18**] she was discharged to home in stable
condition.  Prior to discharge she had a CT scan of the
abdomen to [**Month (only) 11197**] for progression versus resolution of her
abdominal findings, for which she was to follow up for the
results with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1305**] in the future.

The patient was afebrile on admission, and the fever
continued until hospital day six.  Pan cultures were sent on
admission, all of which came back negative for infection, and
the patient's fever resolved on triple therapy antibiotics.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Dilaudid 2 mg one to two tablets q.4-6h. p.r.n. for pain.
2.  Zantac 150 mg 1 tablet p.o. b.i.d.

She was started on Lopressor in the hospital; however, she
was to follow up with her primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 11197**] for
the need for antihypertensive medication in the future.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Necrotizing pancreatitis.
