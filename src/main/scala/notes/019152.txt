Service: UROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6736**]
Chief Complaint:
Large left renal cell carcinoma with
tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava just below the
hepatic vessels.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left radical nephrectomy with inferior vena
cavotomy and complete excision of renal vein with inferior
vena caval reconstruction and removal of tumor thrombus.


History of Present Illness:
The patient presented to the emergency room with left sided pain
and on further workup was noted to have a large left renal mass.
Further workup
revealed inferior vena caval thrombus just below the level of
the hepatic vessels in the inferior vena cava and the patient
was also noted to have a pulmonary embolus. He and his family
fully understand the procedure, alternative therapies, benefits,
and risks including death, pulmonary embolism, need for
reoperation, myocardial infarction, CVA, embolism to
other organs, need for long-term ventilation, damage to
adjacent organs including spleen or pancreas, need for colon
resection. They wished to proceed.


Past Medical History:
Mr [**Known lastname 22956**] has a past medical history significant for IDDM, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, right-sided claudication (scheduled for
angiogram in early [**Month (only) 216**]), and depression. In his past surgical
history, he has had a cholecystectomy.

Social History:
Mr [**Name13 (STitle) **] is an ex-smoker of 20 years, with a previous 20-pack
year status. He denies any recreational drug use, and intakes
alcohol socially.


Family History:
This patient's family history is negative for any genitourinary
malignancy; his mother died of brain cancer and his father died
of a myocardial infarction at the age of 59.

Pertinent Results:
.
.
[**8-16**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
1. Echogenic structure seen in IVC consistent with Thrombus or
tumor. This  extends upto 4 cm below the junction of the hepatic
vein and the IVC. Flow is  seen around the thrombus.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Regional left  ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function  is normal (LVEF>55%).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the  descending thoracic aorta.
6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet  excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-15**]+)  mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
9. Prior to IVC cross clamping portion of the IVC thrombus no
longer seen. RV  function still appears good. No echogenic
structures in the RA or RV. Flow  present in the main PA, Left
and Right Pas.

CXR [**8-17**]:
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Mediastinal
widening is
probably due to vascular engorgement in the supine position.
Tips of the
right internal jugular catheter and endotracheal tube are at the
upper margins of the clavicles, both at the thoracic inlet.
Nasogastric tube passes to the mid stomach.  Lungs low in volume
but grossly clear.  Heart size normal.  Mediastinum midline.  No
significant free subdiaphragmatic gas.
.
.
CXR [**8-19**]:
Left lower lobe atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusion,
small on the left and small-to-moderate on the right, which
developed after [**8-17**] are stable since [**8-18**].  Heart is
normal size.  ET tube, right supraclavicular central venous
line, and nasogastric tube are in standard placements.  No
pneumothorax.
.
.
CXR [**8-21**]:
Compared with [**2142-8-20**], the tip of the ETT appears to have been
pulled back somewhat and now projects roughly 5 cm above the
carina.  The
right lung remains grossly clear.  There is diffuse haziness
overlying the
left lung which may be due to a left pleural effusion and
associated linear perihilar densities may represent associated
atelectasis.

The apparent widening of the superior mediastinum is probably
secondary to
patient rotation to the right, with similar appearances seen on
prior films from [**8-19**] and [**2142-8-17**].  Please correlate clinically.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 22956**] was admitted for his procedure on [**2142-8-16**]. He
was prepared and consented for surgery as per standard. At this
time, Mr [**Known lastname 22956**] was aware of all potential risks and benefits of
his procedure. His family was also aware, and it was noted that
his wife is extremely supportive and involved in the situation.
In the operating room, Total estimated blood loss was
approximately 5000 cc.  The patient received a total of 6 units
of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma
during the case. There were no major intra-operative
complications during the case.
.
Mr [**Known lastname 22956**] then spent 6 days in the ICU. Over the course of 6
days, he was extubated, had his NGT removed, and his pressors
(Levophed and Neo) were stopped. His anticoagulation medications
were held during the duration of his ICU care. He recieved
supportive care, and was seen by the nutrition team. In
addition, the renal team followed him to ensure adequate renal
function. During his stay in the ICU, he was started on
broadspectrum antibiotics for a possible chest infection; the
patient had thick copious secretions and a chest xray was
obtained. His sputum was found to be gram stain positive, and
hence, he was started on Levaquin and vancomycin.
.
Once Mr [**Known lastname 22956**] was stable, he was transferred to the floor. On
the floor, he was re-started on his coumadin with a target INR
of 2.0 - 3.0. He appeared to be depressed by members of
housestaff and his family. Psychiatry was asked to see him, and
they advised outpatient follow-up and adjusted his
antidepressant medication dosages.
.
Mr [**Known lastname 22956**] was seen by a social worker, where he was able to
discuss his recent cancer diagnosis, and his recent surgery. It
was felt this visit slightly lifted his spirits, as he began to
ambulate more often with encouragement. He was seen by physical
therapy to assist with ambulation.
.
Upon discharge, Mr [**Known lastname 22956**] was in a stable condition. His staples
were removed, his FOley removed and his pain under control. His
coumadin levels are to be followed by his PCP
