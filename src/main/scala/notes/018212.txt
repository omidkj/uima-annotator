HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 72-year-old white female
had a chest x-ray in the middle of [**6-/2173**] for bronchitis
with acute shortness of breath at her primary care
physician's office.  She is a long-time smoker.  Chest x-ray
showed an enlarged aorta, and she then had a chest CT which
revealed a chronic thrombosed dissection in the level of the
pulmonary veins to below the celiac access.  The widest
diameter in both lumens was 6.9 cm.  The descending aorta
above the dissection was 5.6 cm.  There was no adenopathy or
masses.  It also showed gallstones and moderate bilateral
adrenal enlargement.  Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was then consulted.
She then had an exacerbation of her chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and was admitted to [**Hospital 5871**] [**Hospital **]
Hospital  for steroid therapy.  She was admitted here for
preop workup.  An echo showed an ejection fraction of 55
percent with trace aortic insufficiency and trace mitral
regurgitation and mild aortic sclerosis.  She was admitted on
[**2173-8-25**] for elective thoracic descending thoracoabdominal
aneurysm repair.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of gallstones, history of
bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a
history of osteoporosis.  She is status post left ankle open
reduction internal fixation with osteomyelitis and an artery
transplant from the left thigh, status post lumbar
discectomy, status post appendectomy, status post
tonsillectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Albuterol inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.
2. Combivent inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.
3. She had been on a prednisone taper that has been
   discontinued.


ALLERGIES:  She has no known allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone.  Has a 50-pack-year smoking
history and is down to two cigarettes a day.  She drinks one
to two glasses of wine per day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems is as above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is an elderly white female in no
apparent distress.  Vital signs stable, afebrile.  HEENT
exam:  Normocephalic, atraumatic; extraocular movements
intact; oropharynx is benign, edentulous.  Neck is supple;
full range of motion; no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly;
carotids 2 plus and equal bilaterally without bruits.  Lung
have bilateral expiratory wheezes.  Cardiovascular exam:
Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 with a faint I/VI
systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen is soft, obese, nontender
with no masses or hepatosplenomegaly; positive bowel sounds.
Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  She
has slight deformity and atrophy of the left ankle with a
well healed surgical scar.  Pulses were femoral 1 plus
bilaterally, dorsalis pedis 2 plus on the right and
nonpalpable on the left, PT is 1 plus on the right and
nonpalpable on the left, radial is 1 plus bilaterally.  Neuro
exam is nonfocal.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  She was admitted on [**2173-8-25**] and
underwent repair of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm with a 26 mm
gel weave graft by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Cross
clamp time was 36 minutes.  She also had a CSF drain placed
at that point.  She tolerated this procedure well and was
transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on propofol and
nitro and insulin.

On postop day 1 she was doing well.  She woke up and moved
everything.  She was thought to not have a good pulse on the
left femoral artery, but an ultrasound revealed good flow, no
pseudoaneurysms and no hematoma.  She also had some left
lower lobe collapse on her x-ray and she was bronched on
postop day 1 and had a lot of secretions.  Her lung
reexpanded well.  We continued to try to wean her from the
vent and give her aggressive respiratory therapy, and she
also required a lot of aggressive diuresis, which she
tolerated well.

She continued to be attempted to be weaned and, on postop day
number 5, her chest tubes were discontinued.  On postop day 6
her intrathecal catheter was discontinued.  She continued to
be weaned.  Also, her creatinine increased to 3.4 on postop
day number 6, and she was followed by Renal.  Renal
ultrasound was normal and she had nonoliguric ATN, so she was
just followed for that and continued to be diuresed.  She was
extubated on postop day 6.  She required aggressive neb
treatments and BI-PAP for the first day.

On postop day 7 she also required intermittent BI-PAP but
eventually improved and so required aggressive respiratory
therapy.  Remained in the unit for respiratory therapy and
continued to slowly improve.  She did also require steroids.
Her extubation was followed by Interventional Pulmonology and
she did have some exacerbations of her respiratory distress.
She also went into atrial fibrillation several times, which
she did not tolerate.  This caused her to have respiratory
distress.  She was started on Amiodarone.  She was followed
by Electrophysiology for this.  She also then had hoarseness
and was seen by Speech and Swallow, who felt she could eat
fine except she aspirated when she used a straw.
Electrophysiology followed her and also added Diltiazem for
her atrial fibrillation.  She was seen by ENT.  One cord is
paralyzed.  Her right vocal cord is sluggish and they said if
she does not improve with her hoarseness, she could follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and he may inject her right vocal cord for
medialization.

She was transferred to the floor on postop day number 18.
She continued to progress with aggressive respiratory
treatment.  She did have another bout of atrial fibrillation
and converted on her own, but she does not tolerate it well,
and she was discharged to Rehab on postop day number 22 in
stable condition.
