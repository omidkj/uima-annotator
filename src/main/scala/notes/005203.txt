[**2115-2-24**] Chest CTA: 1. Status post interval placement of a
descending thoracic aortic stent, which is well positioned.
Possible small area of leak in the lower thoracic aorta into the
aneurysm sac as described, recommend close interval followup
with a normal dose pre-contrast imaging to better define this
area.
[**2115-2-25**] Chest x-ray: Comparison is made with the prior chest
x-ray of [**2115-2-20**]. There has been some improvement in
the degree of failure. Mild upper zone redistribution is still
present and a small left effusion is seen but the interstitial
edema present on the prior chest x ray has resolved.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent elective repair of his
descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. For surgical details,
please see seperate dictated operative note. Following the
operation, he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring.
Initially hypertensive, he initially required intravenous
Labetolol and Nipride. The renal service was also consulted to
manage his normal dialysis schedule. His preoperative
medications were resumed. He gradually weaned from intravenous
therapy. He maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to
the SDU for further care and recovery. A postoperative chest CTA
was notable for a possible small area of leak in the lower
thoracic aorta into the aneurysm sac. The chest CTA was reviewed
by both Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 914**]. The rest of his postoperative
course was uneventful. He was medically cleared for discharge
and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately one month.
