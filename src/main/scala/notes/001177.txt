Date of Birth:   [**2042-3-1**]       Sex:  M

Service:  NEURO/MEDICINE
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 13712**] is a 75 year-old man
with a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes,
end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis who presented
to the hospital less then one hour after sudden onset of
right sided weakness.  The history on presentation was
verbalize answers.  Mr. [**Known lastname 13712**] was at home with his wife the
evening of admission in his usual state of health.

At around 7:00 p.m. the evening of admission the patient sat
down in a chair and suddenly he developed right sided facial
droop and began to drool from the right side of his mouth.
His speech also became slurred/dysarthric.  The patient was
to take the patient to the car to bring him to the hospital,
but he was unable to ambulate without great difficulty,
therefore she called EMS shortly thereafter.

The patient's wife denies any recent trauma, surgery, falls,
reported no symptoms prior to the onset of weakness, no
headaches.  The patient's wife denied any recent or distant
history of GI or urinary bleeding, recent anticoagulation
agents, no seizure like activity or history of stroke.  No
previous intracranial hemorrhage or surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End stage renal disease on dialysis Monday, Wednesday and
Friday, dialyzed via fistula in left arm.
2.  Insulin dependent diabetes.
3.  Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  Valtrex, which is given for herpes zoster roughly
two months prior to admission and resulted in hallucinations.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Insulin NPH.
2.  Nephrocaps.
3.  Epogen at dialysis.
4.  Lipitor.
5.  Antihypertensive unknown at the time of admission which
type.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife in
[**Name (NI) 8**].  He denies smoking, drugs or alcohol history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission he was afebrile with a
blood pressure ranging from 178 to 210 and a heart rate of
78.  In general he was able to open and close his eyes on
command.  He appeared anxious.  The patient was aphasic.  On
neurological examination pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  His visual fields were
grossly intact.  Extraocular movements intact.  Normal facial
sensation.  Tongue midline.  Motor examination his left upper
extremity was 5 out of 5 throughout.  On right upper
extremity examination he was able to lift his arm against
gravity to 30 degrees, unable to open and close fist.  Right
upper extremity strength was 2 out of 5.  Lower extremities
were 5 out of 5 bilaterally.  Sensory examination was grossly
normal throughout and coordination was grossly normal.  There
are no other physical examination findings documented on
presentation.

LABORATORIES ON PRESENTATION:  Hematocrit 38.7, hemoglobin
12.7, white count 5.6, platelet count 219, MCV 99, PT 12.5,
PTT 29.4, INR 1.0.  Chemistries 142, 4.3, 101, 27, 39, 7.7
and 138.

The patient had a CT on admission that showed evidence of
multiple small areas of increased density suggestive of old
cerebrovascular accidents.  No evidence of acute bleed.

IMPRESSION ON ADMISSION:  This is a 75 year-old man with a
complicated past medical history including hypertension and
end stage renal disease now with a witnessed stroke effecting
his right side.  The patient received tissue plasminogen
activator within 55 minutes of reaching the hospital,
therefore roughly two hours after the onset of his symptoms.
His right sided weakness subjectively improved after tissue
plasminogen activator administration.  The patient was
initial placed on a labetalol drip to decrease his systolic
to less then 170 and was transferred to the Neuro ICU.

The prior is a summary of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course prior
to transfer to the Medicine Service on [**2117-3-12**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the [****] the patient
developed worsening of his right sided hemiparesis acutely.
This was thought to be secondary to hypotension, therefore
the Labetalol drip was discontinued.  The patient's blood
pressure had dropped to a systolic of 100.  He was placed on
neo-synephrine drip to maintain systolics greater then 140.
The patient had an MRI on [**2117-3-6**] that showed an acute left
sided parietal infarct.  He continued to improve clinically
with increased right sided strength.

The patient was transferred out to the floor on [**2117-3-6**] to the
Neurological Service.  On [**2117-3-7**] the patient developed atrial
flutter with a rate of 130 to 140.  The patient was
asymptomatic and his blood pressure was stable.  He received
a total of 20 mg of intravenous Diltiazem and Lopressor had
no effect.  The patient was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction and it was decided to consult cardiology.

On the [**3-8**] the patient had acute mental status
changes and was not responsive and was quite agitated.  He
was given Haldol and Ativan.  There was no improvement in his
agitation with Haldol and Ativan and his agitation actually
worsened.  Therefore it was decided to electively intubate
and sedate the patient and he was transferred to the MICU.

In the MICU Cardiology was consulted and recommended
Amiodarone for the patient's atrial flutter.  After the
patient was intubated and sedated he was placed on
intravenous Amiodarone.  Arterial blood gas at the time of
intubation was 7.36, 44 and 87.  The patient was placed back
on a neo-synephrine drip with a goal systolic pressures of
150s and 160s.

A head CT was done that was negative for acute bleeding in
the setting of mental status changes.  The patient was rate
controlled with intravenous Diltiazem.

On the [**3-9**] the patient had a transesophageal
echocardiogram that showed no evidence of thrombus.
Transesophageal echocardiogram also noted left ventricular
hypertrophy and a normal left ventricular function with an EF
of greater then 50%.  The patient had been anticoagulated on
heparin intravenous since admission.  He had DC cardioversion
on the day of [**2117-3-9**] and was cardioverted into a wandering
pacemaker rhythm with a rate of 80 to 90.

On [**2117-3-10**] the patient was started on tube feeds.  Overnight
he spiked to 101 and his white blood cell count increased
from 9.6 to 20.  The patient was started empirically on
intravenous Vancomycin and Levofloxacin.  The reason these
antibiotics were chosen is that on chest x-ray the patient
had a left lower lobe consolidation and on blood cultures
that were drawn at the time of temperature spike 1 out of 4
showed gram positive cocci and clusters.

On [**2117-3-11**] the patient was noted to have decreased movement of
his right side acutely.  It was recommended by the
Neurological Service to keep the patient's partial
thromboplastin time around 60 to prevent hemorrhagic
transformation.  The patient also received 1 unit of packed
red blood cells for a hematocrit of 29 on this day and his
target SBP was now 130 systolically as per Neurologic.  On
[**2117-3-12**] the patient was no longer requiring neo-synephrine to
maintain systolics of 130 and he was extubated successfully.
The patient was continued on heparin.  He was placed on po
Amiodarone 400 po q.d.

The patient also had a speech and swallow evaluation at the
bedside on this day to rule out aspiration as the etiology of
his left lower lobe consolidation.  Bedside evaluation was
negative for aspiration and a video swallow was scheduled.
As previously stated the patient was transferred to the
Medicine Service on [**2117-3-12**].

His medications on transfer included an insulin sliding
scale, aspirin 325 q.d., Atorvastatin 10 q.d., Ranitidine 150
po q day, Epogen with hemodialysis, Heparin GTT with a goal
partial thromboplastin time of 60 to 80.  Amiodarone 400 po
q.d. times seven days to then be switched to 200 po q
daytime one month, date of initiation [**2117-3-10**].  Levofloxacin
250 mg po q 48 hours for left lower lobe consolidation, start
date [**2117-3-10**].  Vancomycin 1 gram intravenous dose per level at
hemodialysis start date [**2117-3-10**].

The patient's physical examination on transfer to the Medical
Floor included, vital signs temperature a
