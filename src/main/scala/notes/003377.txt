CXR [**2130-3-24**]:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were
obtained. In the left upper to mid lung, there is a 0.5 cm
calcified nodule most likely representing a calcified granuloma.
No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
are unremarkable. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old woman with history of PUD, dementia of unclear
etiology, and auditory hallucinations who presents after hearing
voices telling her to harm herself.

#. Hallucinations/SI:  The patient has a history of auditory
hallucinations and subacute memory decline since [**2124**].  The
patient was seen by psychiatry for hallucinations, who
recommended Risperdal [**Hospital1 **] for symptoms.   RPR, TSH, HIV, and B12
were negative on admission.  However, the patient was noted to
have positive RPR and anti-treponemal antibody at an OSH in
[**2128**], untreated per records and discussion with PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 92169**] antibody had been repeated at the OSH just prior
to the patient's admission to [**Hospital1 18**], and again returned positive
during her hospital stay.  Positive anti-treponemal antibody
with subacute memory decline and vivid visual and auditory
hallucinations concerning for neuro-syphilis as source of
symptoms.  The patient underwent lumbar puncture that showed 1
WBC and elevated protein to 55 that may be consistent with late
neuro-syphilis.  CSF-VDRL and HSV PCR negative, anti-treponemal
antibody pending.  As the patient was noted to have a penicillin
allergy, she was transferred to the ICU for penicillin
desensitization.  She then was started on a 10 day course of
penicillin G to be completed night of [**2130-4-7**].  Given the
patient underwent desensitization, she may not miss a dose of
medication, as it may result in serious side effects.  The
patient should follow up with her PCP on discharge regarding her
symptoms, and for referral to cognitive neurology.  She should
undergo neuropsychiatric testing as an outpatient. Under the
guidance of psychiatry, she was started on risperidone. She had
marked improvement in her hallucinations on this medication.

#. Abdominal pain: On admission, the patient complained of mild
abdominal pain that by history was consistent with GERD.  She
was also found to have a mildly elevated lipase to 74.
Abdominal pain may also be a manifestation of the hallucinations
i.e. snakes in stomach. She was started on ranitidine and Maalox
for symptoms.  With improvement in her symptoms, she was
transitioned to pantoprazole.  She should follow up with her PCP
if symptoms recur.

#. Vulvovaginitis: Patient reported whitish vaginal discharge
and pruritis after starting penicillin.  Pelvic exam revealed
erythema, and the patient was given fluconazole 150mg PO x1.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Patient should complete 10-day penicillin course night of
[**4-7**].  She may not miss a dose, as she has a PCN allergy and is
s/p desensitization.
# Patient needs follow up with cognitive neurology.  Must make
appointment through PCP for insurance purposes.
