Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
biliary stent removal

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with removal of previuosly placed biliary stent


History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 year-old man with history of gallstone
pancreatitis/gangrenous cholecystitis s/p cholecystectomy on
[**10-18**] subsequently complicated by cystic duct stump bile leak
requiring ERCP with stenting on [**2110-11-2**], ARDS/Acute lung injury
presumed secondary to pancreatitis, left pneumothorax requiring
chest tube, sepsis, atrial fibrillaiton, and respiratory failure
requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation now s/p trach on
[**2109-11-15**].  He now has persistent ventilator dependent
respiratory failure.  He is admitted for removal of the biliary
stent placed on [**2109-11-2**].

Patient currently under care at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital.  Currently,
by report his is vent dependent and has had persistent cuff leak
issues.  Currently with cuff pressure of 30 mmH and needs 8-9 cc
of air in balloon to prevent leak.  Trach recently changed to 8
cuffed tube. His mental status is responsive with eye contact
but with general apathy and poorly responsive to stimuli.  No
pain issues and on no sedation.

Had recent funguria with [**Female First Name (un) 564**] for which he is maintained on
flucanozole with his course scheduled to finish on [**12-24**] and
receiving q shift baldder irrigation.  Also with recent
Klebsiella pneumonia. Completed antibiotic course for this.
His nutritional status is tenuous as he has had difficulty with
diarrhea complicating his tubefeeds and required augmentation
with TPN, baseline albumin about 1.7  Maintained on flagyl for
the diarrhea, despite being repeatedly C. diff negative.  Flagyl
also scheduled to end on [**12-24**].
Patient has chronic anemia with baseline about 30, has been
guiac negative.  Grade 3 sacral decub.
No issues with recent a fib.

On admission, patient denies all pain.

EKG: LBBB

Chest x-ray [**12-23**]: CLINICAL INDICATION: Intubated. Question ARDS.


Since the prior chest radiograph, there has been interval
placement of a
tracheostomy tube. A left subclavian vascular catheter is
present, in
satisfactory position, and a feeding tube terminates below the
diaphragm. The
heart demonstrates left ventricular configuration. There is
prominence of the
pulmonary vascularity, and there are diffuse bilateral hazy
areas of increased
opacity with slightly more confluent consolidation centrally in
the lungs.
There are probable layering pleural effusions bilaterally.

IMPRESSION:

New diffuse pulmonary opacities, most prominent centrally. The
appearance
favors pulmonary edema, but the differential diagnosis includes
diffuse
infection and ARDS.

Chest x-ray [**12-25**]:
INDICATION: A 75-year-old male with ARDS, pancreatitis.

TECHNIQUE: Portable AP chest radiograph.

The comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated
[**2109-12-23**].

FINDINGS:

The patient is status post tracheostomy. Left subclavian venous
catheter is
unchanged compared to the prior study. The cardiac and
mediastinal contours
are unchanged compared to the prior study. Again, note is made
of bilateral
patchy parenchymal opacities, slightly improved compared to the
prior study,
especially in right lower lobe. Persistent diffuse hazy
opacities noted,
representing pulmonary edema. Continued left lower lobe
opacification is
noted, representing pneumonia versus atelectasis. Continued
pleural effusion
is noted. Mild CHF is noted, slightly decreased compared to the
prior study.

IMPRESSION:

Improvement of multiple patchy opacities in bilateral lungs,
especially in
right lower lobe, associated with edema, effusion, and
persistent
opacification of left lower lobe. Improving CHF.
