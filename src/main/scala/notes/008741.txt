Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine / Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
AICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
84 yo male with hx of ischemic CM, polymorphic VT s/p ICD, ESRD
who presents after AICD firing. Pt reports not feeling well for
the past month with decreased energy but no chest pain, chest
tightness or increasing SOB. He has lost [**12-26**] lbs and has
decreased appetite with dysphagia, and his meals consist almost
entirely of oatmeal. He awoke today in his USOH and went to
dialysis which he tolerated well. While waiting for his daughter
to pick him up he felt a sudden flushing feeling in his face but
no chest pain, tightness or palpitations. This resolved
spontaneously. Then while sitting at home watching TV he felt
presyncopal with the same warm feeling and then woke up to his
ICD firing. He was found by his daughter slumped in his chair
but was alert by the time she questioned him. She called EMS and
he felt well until arrival of EMS. While on the ride to the
hospital he again felt the "warm feeling" and the ICD fired
twice in the ambulance. This recurred twice in the ED at
[**Hospital3 2783**]. Labs revealed a potassium of 2.4 so he was
given 10 mEq of IV potassium and 20meq PO and he was started on
a Lidocaine gtt at 2mg/min after an initial bolus of 50mg. Plan
was then made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

[**2140-5-11**] - CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: Comparison is made to
[**2139-12-21**]. Dual lead pacemaker demonstrates a similar
configuration. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
Although a left-sided pleural effusion is resolved, there is a
markedly increased right-sided pleural effusion, occupying most
of the right hemithorax. Given the lack of mediastinal shift,
there is probably considerable associated collapse of the lower
portions of the right lung. The right apex is aerated. The
pulmonary vascularity is similarly prominent.
IMPRESSION: Interval marked increase in right-sided pleural
effusion.
.
[**2140-5-11**] - ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with global
hypokinesis and akineis of the distal septum, apex and
infero-laterla walls. Right ventricular chamber  size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-11-6**],
the LVEF
appears lower and the severity of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] are now more
significant.

[**2140-5-18**]-- CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated an LMCA, LAD, LCx and RCA free of angiographically
significant CAD. The previously placed stents (LAD with 2.5x18
cypher,
diagonal with 2.5x10 BMS and OM1 with 3.5x8 and 3.5x6) were
patent.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressures.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal with patent previously placed
stents.

Brief Hospital Course:
#) CAD:The patient has a known history of CAD and initially this
event did not seem to be caused by ischemia. An echocardiogram,
however, showed a worsening EF to 25%, raising ischemia as a
possible cause.  His CKs were flat and troponins were mildly
elevated in the setting of renal failure. Cath on [**5-18**] revealed
clean coronaries with patent stents. We continued his ASA,
B-blocker, ACE-I, statin.
.
#) Rhythm: Telemetry strips revealed polymorphic VT likely due
to severe hypokalemia as has occurred in the past.  The
patient's potassium was repleted to 4.0.  Mexilitine was
continued at his home dose.  The patient had no events until the
3 day of admission when his ICD fired after returning from
dialysis.  Potassium was 4.1 and free calcium was slightly low
at 1.04.  The electrophysiology service was involved in the
patient's care. The pacer was interrogated and fired
appropriately. A resting thalium MIBI was performed to eval for
possible scar and an ablatable focus for the VT. This was
negative. As above, cardiac cath revealed clean coronaries with
patent stents.
.
#) Pump: Pt was not clinically volume overloaded except for
isolated rt sided pleural effusion.  The effusion was thought to
be related to inadequate UF with dialysis, but we also
considered other processes such as worsening CHF and
malignancy. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid was
negative for malignant cells.
