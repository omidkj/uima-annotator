RENAL U/S:
The study is limited by body habitus. The kidneys demonstrate a
homogenous echotexture, although are slightly hyperechoic to the
liver which may indicate underlying medical renal disease. There
is no evidence of hydronephrosis, mass or stone. No definite
stent is seen. IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
.
CXR:
IMPRESSION: Right IJ terminates at the cavoatrial junction. No
acute cardiopulmonary disease is identified. Stable
cardiomegaly, suggestive of possible cardiomyopathy.
.
EKG: 4:1<-->2:1 flutter; EKG#2 4:1 flutter w/ LAD and LAFB, no
ST segment changes; flutter not noted on prior EKGs
.
ECHO [**2123-6-16**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricle may be mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2122-3-24**], estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is now higher.

p-mibi [**2121**] negative


Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo male w/ h/o diastolic CHF, CAD s/p MI, chronic renal
insufficiency (Cr 1.3-1.7), h/o lower GI bleed, diverticulosis,
CVA, C.diff, urosepsis who presents to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] with
several days of shortness of breath, gradually worseing fatigue,
acute on chronic renal failure and newly diagnosed atrial
flutter.
.
1. Dyspnea
The most likely etiology was CHF exacerbation secondary to new
atrial flutter. BNP was elevated to 9866 on admission. Chest
x-ray on admission showed possible pleural effusion on left side
and stable cardiomegaly. EKG showed new atrial flutter with no
evidence of acute myocardial ischemia. Cardiac enzymes x 3 were
negative. The patient received Lasix 20 mg IV x 2. He had good
urine output and denied any dyspnea during his hospital stay. He
was on oxygen 2L nc which was d/c'd on HOD3.
.
2. Fatigue
His fatigue had started 1-2 months PTA and was most likely
secondary to his CHF and recent lower GI bleed/anemia. Other
contributing causes were uremia (BUN 113) and atrial flutter.
His Hct on admission was 29.3. His Hct in the past have been
between 26-35. His guaiac tests were all negative. Another
contributing was an UTI and bacteremia. His urine culture and
blood culture were positive for E.coli.
On HOD3 he felt much better and was not exhausted any mor.
.
3. Atrial flutter
Possible etilogy was the UTI and bacteremia and CHF
exacerbation. Thyrotoxicosis was unlikely as T4 was normal.
Electrophysiology was consulted and did not change his
metoprolol. He was started on aspirin but no anticoagulation due
to his risk for GI bleed. He got an ECHO which showed LVEF >
55%, and minor changes from last ECHO.
.
4. Acute renal failure
The patient's Cr was 4.3 on admission with baseline Cr 1.3-1.7.
The most likely cause was pre-renal, cardiogenic acute renal
failure resulting from hypoperfusion of kidneys secondary to CHF
and decreased stroke volume. Post-renal cause was unlikely since
renal US was negative for any hydronephrosis. Renal cause was
unlikely since there are no urine casts, no RBC, no protein.
His Cr improved daily and he had good urine output.
.
5. UTI
Patient had positive UA with urine cx E.coli, sensitive to
ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin.  He had no c/o dysuria, hematuria
while in the hospital. He was treated with Ceftriaxone 1 grm IV
q24h while in the hospital and he will be discharged on cipro to
complete a 14 day course.
.
6. Bacteremia
Blood culture was positive for E.coli, sensitive to ceftriaxone
and ciprofloxacin. He had no signs of sepsis. No tachycardia, no
fever or hypothermia. WBC decreasing. He was treated with
Ceftriaxone 1 grm IV q24h while in the hospital and he will be
discharged on cipro to complete a 14 day course.
.
7. Hyperkalemia
The patient's potassium increased to 5.2 on [**10-26**]. This was most
likely related to acute renal insufficiency. EKG showed no
peaked T waves. He received Kayexalate and his potssium
decreased to 4.7. He was placed on a renal/low K diet.
.
8. Gastrointestinal bleed:
Patient has  history of recurrent bleeds in the past. During
this admission, he was noted to have several large bloody bowe
