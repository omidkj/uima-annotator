Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PCTA with DES x3.


History of Present Illness:
57 yo male with obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and chronic low
back pain who presents wtih unrelenting chest pain that
developed while pt was watching NY giants game. Pt noted
"twinge" of CP while driving his wife to the laundromat. Chest

decrease in exercise tolerance or chest pain prior to today,
however, on further questioning he reveals that he decreased his
worok as a roofer due to being tired and decreased his gym
exercise because the gym he goes to no longer has a sauna. Has
not worked out in the past 3 weeks. He currently denies chest
pain, SOB, PND, DOE, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain.
.
In ED at OSH, EKG showed abnl EKG with septal Qs, T wave
flattening throughout).Pt got loaded with Plavix (300mg),
heparin gtt, integrillin gtt, nitro gtt, then taken to the cath
lab.Cath showed severe 3vd with thrombotic appearing LAD. Pt was
referred to [**Hospital1 **] for CT surgery evaluation for CABG.

[**2139-9-27**]: ECG: Sinus rhythm
Long QTc interval
Left axis deviation - anterior fascicular block

[**2139-9-27**]: CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality
.
[**2139-9-28**]: carotid ultrasound: Duplex ultrasonography was
performed at the level of the cervical portions of the bilateral
carotid and vertebral arteries.

No plaque was found on either side. The velocities, waveforms
and velocity ratio in the bilateral carotid and vertebral
arteries were normal, with antegrade flow.
.
[**2139-9-28**]: Echo:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis with preservation of the basal lateral
and basal
posterior walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely
depressed.
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen
.
[**2139-9-28**]: Cath
1. Initial access was extremely difficult due to severe
tortuosity of
the right iliac artery.
  2. Selective coronary angiography of the left circulation
demonstrated
a 95% thrombotic stenosis in the mid-LAD with serial 90% and 80%

stenoses in the LCX.
  3. Successful PCI of the LAD with a 3.0 x 23 mm Cypher DES.
  4. Successful PCI of the LCX with two Cypher DES (3.5 x 13 mm
and 3.5
x 23 mm, non-overlapping).
  5. Final angiography demonstrated no dissections, no residual
stenoses, and TIMI-3 flow in both vessels.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful multivessel PCI of the LAD and LCX.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  Now s/p PCI with stenting of LAD and LCx.
Has remained stable and chest pain free throughout
hospitalization.
*
1. CAD: 57 year old male with PMH hyperlipidemia, obesity
admitted with acute anterior MI and newly diagnosed three vessel
disease transferred for evaluation by CT surgery for potential
CABG. Pt was found to have a recent anterior MI with peak
troponin of 1700. In the setting of his recent MI, the decision
was made to postpone CABG and to undergo PCI. Pt had PCI with
stenting of LAD and LCx. Pt remained stable and chest pain free
throughout hospitalization. Pt was medically managed with ASA,
beta-blocker, ACE, statin. Plavix was started with plans to
continue for 9-12mo, during which CABG would be deferred.
*
2. Pump: Pt was found to have severe global hypokinesis on echo.
Pt appeared to be euvolemic. Pt was started on medical
management of his heart failure with a long-acting beta-blocker
and ACE. Pt was started on coumadin with a heparin bridge, with
plans to continue anticoagulation for 6 months. We recommend
rechecking echo in 3 months, if still has EF<30% in setting of
CAD would recommend ICD placement.

3. Rhythm: No events on tele.

4. Low back pain: We continued percocets prn

5. PPX: cont sc heparin and ranitidine
