HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85 year-old
man with multiple medical problems who is admitted for mental
status changes, weakness and shortness of breath.  The
patient is unable to provide a history and the history was
gathered from the chart in medical records.  The patient
reportedly had increased weakness and shortness of breath
since the Thursday previous to admission.  He also had loose
stools that were nonbloody.  The patient also had fevers and
cough, but no nausea and vomiting.  Of note the patient had
recently been hospitalized at the [**Hospital3 **] TCU for ninety
nine days.  He had then been transferred to the [**Hospital6 33698**] and during that stay was treated for a right
lower lobe pneumonia and staph bacteremia.

In the Emergency Room the patient was noted to have a
temperature of 100 and a white blood cell count of 27.2.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral atelectasis with small
effusions.  There was also redistribution of the pulmonary
vasculature in the upper zone.  The CT angio was negative for
pulmonary embolus.  The patient had urine sent for urinalysis
and culture, blood culture times two and was empirically
started on intravenous Levofloxacin.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 20, differential 92%
polys, 2% bands, 4% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes, hematocrit
28.5, platelets 296.  Sodium 134, potassium 3.3, chloride 28,
bicarb 23, BUN 33, creatinine 0.9, glucose 151.  Chest x-ray
as described in the history of present illness.  Pelvic x-ray
showed no evidence of hip fracture and CT angiogram was
negative for PE, but showed bilateral large pleural effusions
with consolidation collapse of the right lower lobe and
partial collapse and consolidation of the left lower lobe.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.4.  Pulse 74.  Blood
pressure 110/60.  Respiratory rate 24.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat revealed no sclera icterus.  No
lymphadenopathy.  No erythema or exudates in the pharynx.
Heart had a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex.  Lungs had
decreased breath sounds at both bases with dullness and
bronchial breath sounds at the right base.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended with good bowel sounds.  The
extremities revealed no edema and a cast on the right forearm
and two ulcers on the right hip with erythema and yellow
drainage and necrotic edges and a mid thoracic ulcer with
erythema and no drainage.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a complicated hospital
course due to the multiple sources of infection.  In addition
to the sources noted in the history of present illness the
patient also was found to have multiple dental abscesses, the
decubitus ulcers noted and pneumonia and a Methacillin
sensitive staph aureus high grade bacteremia.  He was treated
initially with broad spectrum antibiotics and the coverage
was later narrowed according to the sensitivities of the
organisms, which grew out in the culture.  The patient failed
to progress on the floor and ultimately was transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit on [**9-7**] for respiratory failure
and was intubated and supported with mechanical ventilation.
The patient was found at that point to have large pleural
effusions bilaterally and thoracentesis, however, revealed no
active infection in the fluid.

The patient was also found on CT to have a new fracture on
the right iliac crest.  The Orthopedic Service was consulted
and felt that no surgical treatment was warranted given the
patient's grave medical condition.  The CT also revealed
fluid collection in the right gluteal area, which was drained
under CT guidance, however, this also did not reveal a source
for the patient's high grade bacteremia.  Ultimately the
patient was extubated, however, his condition deteriorated
and on the morning of [**9-28**] the patient became acutely
hypotensive and his respirations became labored and the
patient's daughter was consulted who chose to make the
patient comfort measures only.  He expired on [**9-28**] of
respiratory failure secondary to sepsis and hypotension.

DIAGNOSES AT DEATH:
1.  Methicillin sensitive staph aureus bacteremia.
2.  Dental abscesses.
3.  Decubitus ulcer.
4.  Pneumonia.
5.  Iliac crest fracture.
6.  Sepsis.
