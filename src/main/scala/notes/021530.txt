Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year old
white male patient with a history of rheumatic heart disease
and a six month history of increasing dyspnea on exertion. He
has no associated chest pain or syncope.  Transthoracic
echocardiogram revealed a dilated left atrium as well as
severe aortic stenosis, moderate mitral stenosis, mild mitral
regurgitation, mild aortic insufficiency and 3+ tricuspid
regurgitation.  Cardiac catheterization showed a preserved
left ventricular function as well as normal coronary
arteries.  The patient is referred for aortic valve and
mitral valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cerebrovascular accident times two in [**2165**], and [**2169**],
with no residual.
2.  Heavy smoking history, 120 pack years, quit approximately
one month prior to admission.
3.  Chronic atrial fibrillation.
4.  Status post colon resection in [**2165**].
5.  Status post bilateral cataract removal.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies alcohol intake.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Flovent and Combivent inhalers twice a day.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once daily.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
the day of surgery.  He was taken to the operating room on
[**2171-9-30**], where he underwent aortic valve replacement which
was a #23 tissue valve as well as a mitral valve replacement
with a #27 tissue valve.  Postoperatively, the patient was
transported from the operating room to the Cardiac Surgery
recovery room on Milrinone, Epinephrine intravenous drip,
eventually added Levophed, Propofol, insulin and Amiodarone
drips.  The patient required a fair amount of intravenous
fluids initially because of hypotension and he was AV paced
upon arrival from the operating room.  The morning of
postoperative day number one the patient continued overnight
with some hemodynamic instability and significant
hypotension.  Because of this, he underwent a transesophageal
echocardiogram which revealed some right ventricular free
wall hypokinesis as well as well seated and functioning
valves.  He also underwent a bronchoscopy at that time which
showed severe tracheomalacia and increased secretions.  The
following day the patient remains on full ventilator support,
remains on Amiodarone, Epinephrine, Milrinone and Vasopressin
intravenous drip.  He remained sedated to tolerate his
ventilator support as well as due to some hemodynamic
instability.  On [**2171-10-3**], the patient was begun with
diuresis as it looked at that time like he was going to
require longer term ventilator support and was started on
tube feedings.  Also on [**2171-10-3**], the patient received a
consultation by the hematology service due to
thrombocytopenia.  Their recommendation was to discontinue
possible drugs which could contribute to thrombocytopenia and
his Heparin induced thrombocytopenic screen ultimately came
back negative.  The following day postoperative day four the
Levophed was discontinued although the patient remained
sedated to tolerate full ventilator support.  He was also on
Epinephrine and Vasopressin at that time and sedated with
Fentanyl and Versed drips.  The following day the patient
underwent another bronchoscopy due to continued secretions
and his tracheomalacia was looking to be improved.  Some
secretions were clean out during the bronchoscopy and his
chest tubes were discontinued.  The following day the patient
remained on Epinephrine, Vasopressin drip although decreasing
doses of both.  Postoperative day seven, the patient was
noted to have high tube feed residuals and Reglan was
initiated.  The patient was ultimately ramped up to goal on
tube feeds. Thrombocytopenia was noted to have been resolving
at that time  He underwent another bronchoscopy due to
increased secretions and was cleaned out adequately.  By
postoperative day nine, the patient was noted to be waking
up, more responsive, able to tolerate wakefulness on the
ventilator, was noted to have increased abdominal tenderness
as well as marginally elevated temperature and white blood
cell count as well as elevated liver function tests.
Ultrasound at that time of his abdomen revealed a dilated
gallbladder.  A general surgery consultation was obtained by
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who recommended cholecystostomy tubes to
be placed.  The following day, [**2171-10-10**], the patient was
taken to the interventional radiology department where he
underwent placement of a cholecystostomy tube.  It was the
general surgery consult services recommendation to leave this
tube in for approximately six weeks.  Over the next couple
days, the patient's Vasopressin was continuing to be
decreased as the patient's blood pressure improved.  His
Epinephrine was weaned off.  He was resumed on his
anticoagulation.  Heparin was started for atrial
fibrillation. Vancomycin and Levofloxacin were discontinued
at that time and his ventilator was weaned to CPAP mode.  On
[**2171-10-13**], the patient was weaned off his Vasopressin.  Zosyn
and Heparin were being continued at that time.  He was weaned
from mechanical ventilator and extubated.  The patient
continued over the next few days in atrial fibrillation with
a controlled ventricular response rate in the 80s to 90s,
blood pressure which was stable and continued with aggressive
pulmonary toilet.  He had significant periods of confusion,
worsening at night, but was ultimately transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit to the telemetry floor on [**2171-10-18**],
postoperative day eighteen, where he was on two liter nasal
cannula oxygen.  His blood pressure was stable.  He remained
in atrial fibrillation with a rate in the 90s and continued
with aggressive pulmonary toilet.  The patient did require
sitters while on the telemetry floor due to worsening
agitation and confusion at night.  The patient continued with
diuresis and was tolerating that well.  On the evening of
[**2171-10-19**], the patient was noted to have worsening hypoxia,
with very weak cough effort.  Pulmonary toilet and
nasotracheal suctioning did not improve his oxygenation and
the patient essentially had a respiratory arrest at about
9:00 p.m. and was intubated.  He was transferred back in to
the Cardiac Surgery recovery unit at that time and underwent
a bronchoscopy for which he was noted to have erythematous
airways as well as moderate amounts of tan secretions.  He
underwent bronchoscopy the following day as well for
secretion clearance.  The patient had also become hypotensive
with the reintubation and sedation required to facilitate the
mechanical ventilator and was started on Neo-Synephrine drip.
On [**2171-10-21**], the patient was continued on bronchodilators.
He was given some Diamox for metabolic alkalosis, continued
on Flagyl and Zosyn empirically for his cholecystostomy tube
placement.  Tube feeds were continued.  The patient had a
neurology consultation at that time due to family's concern
about speech deficit which he had prior to being intubated.
Their recommendations at that time were to continue
anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation, to put him on a
statin drug for stroke prevention and to reevaluate him after
extubating him again.  Over the next couple of days, he
underwent slow wean of pressure support.  He remained on
Neo-Synephrine for some continued hypotension and remained on
Heparin for his atrial fibrillation.  Another bronchoscopy
was performed on [**2171-10-26**], where thick tan secretions were
obtained.  The patient was ultimately extubated again on
[**2171-10-27**], and has required aggressive pulmonary toilet to
maintain a stable airway and oxygenation status.  The
following day the patient underwent a swallow evaluation by
the Speech Therapy Department here and it was noted at that
time that he had nonfunctional swallow.  It was their
recommendation to maintain a strict NPO s
