Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Admitted for right heart catheterization and evaluation for
weaning off milrinone therapy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization and Swan Ganz catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 64 year old man with a history of end stage
ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p CABG in [**2135**] now with improved EF to
35-40% on Milrinone at 0.6mcg/kg/min since [**2151**]. At that time,
he was not a heart transplant candidate due to irreversible
pulmonary hypertension. Over the years he has been doing
extremely well without significant heart failure. He has not
been on diuretics in years. Last echo from [**2154**]: LVEF 35-40%. He
was admitted for RHC and hemodynamics on and off milrinone to
assess for possible weaning off of milrinone.  Right heart
catheterization was performed, and he tolerated the procedure
well.  PA pressures 35/15, PCWP 22, CO 3.47 and CI 1.97 on
milrinone .6 mcg.kg/min.
.
Patient reports he has been feeling quite well. Denies any
increasing SOB, CP, palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness,
fevers.  He does report a dry cough that is occasionally
productive of small amounts of white sputum.  He has been taking
sugar free robitussin as home.  Two of his daughters at home
currently have colds.  He has had the flu shot.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
.
EKG demonstrated V pacing, rate 72
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**9-15**] demonstrated:  The left
atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
mild-moderate global hypokinesis (EF 35-40%) and septal near
akinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Cardiac catheterization ([**2156-4-1**]) -
1.  Resting hemodynamics revealed high-normal right-sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP 9 mmHg.  Mild elevation of pulmonary
arterial
systolic pressures with PASP 35 mmHg.  Elevated mean wedge of 22
mmHg.
Depressed cardiac output with CI 2.0 L/min/m2.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Mild elevation of filling pressures on chronic milrinone.
2.  Transfer to CCU for milrinone wean with swan in place.

.
Trans-Thoracic Echocardiogram ([**2156-4-1**]) -
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely
depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis
of the septum and hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2154-9-24**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
somewhat reduced.

.
Trans-Thoracic Echocardiogram ([**2156-4-2**]) -
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate to severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures
of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2156-4-1**], the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, TO BE REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN
MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS:
#. Ischemic cardiomyopathy - The patient has a known history of
ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15-20% in [**2151**] and has
been on milrinone since then. Repeat TTE in [**9-/2154**] revealed
improvement in his EF to 35-40%. He had not been requiring
standing diur
