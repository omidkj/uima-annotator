CT Chest:
1) Confluent areas of consolidation right upper lobe and patchy
nodular areas
of consolidation in the right lower lobe most consistent with
multifocal
pneumonia.

2) Likely element of superimposed pulmonary edema.

3) Left greater than right small pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
86F PMH of CAD, CHF--EF 30% with severe MR, Dermatomyositis, DM,
presented on [**11-16**] c/o generalized weakness for 1 week, with
acute onset of SOB on the evening of [**11-15**], both at rest and
with exertion.  Pt also noted to have had loose stools for the
past week, but no other symptoms.

1. PNA: On admission CXR, pt was noted to have a multifocal
pneumonia and was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone. She
was also noted on admission to have ARF and hyperglycemia.  She
was placed on O2NC and given steroids and albuterol/ipratropium
nebs.  She remained afebrile, and appeared to have a stable
leukocytosis.  Influenza was considered, but no washing was
obtained at the lab; the patient was placed on droplet
precautions. On the floor, the patient continued to develop SOB,
and required ICU transfer. Respiratory decompensation at that
time thought secondary to super-imposed pulmonary edeam. In the
ICU, she continued on ceftriaxone/azithromycin for
community-acquired PNA.  CT chest showed interstitial lung
disease with persistent RUL PNA.  She clinically improved and
was transferred to the floor where antibiotic treatment was
continued (D1=[**11-17**]). She is currently scheduled to complete her
antibiotics on [**12-1**] and has picc line in place for this.
As mentioned above, sputum was not obtained. It is unclear as to
the etiology of this multi-focal PNA. Given h/o dermatomyositis,
there were concerns of underlying lung dz. However, no formal
PFTs were ever documented prior to this PNA. Her oxygen
requirements have decreased through-out her stay but she was
advised to f/u Pulmonary for an outpt managemnt. She has been
asked to call radiology to for repeat CXR in 4 weeks time to
re-assess interval progression. Her oxygen requirement has
improved, but she still remains on 2-4L NC. This should be
weaned as tolerated to keep sats 93%-95%.

2. Afib: On admission, pt found to be in rapid Afib, which
apparently had occurred 1 time before. She was started on a
heparin drip for anticoagulation, lopressor PO for rate control,
and was scheduled for an Echo which was not performed prior to
transfer.  While on the floor, HR were 90s - 110s, with BP
115/58. It is thought that her transfer to the ICU was the
result of CHF in the setting of rapid afib. In the ICU, she was
eventually rate controlled w/ beta blockade and dig. Following
transfer back to the floor, she underwent TEE (no thrombus)
followed by DCCV on [**2161-11-26**]. She will continue on digoxin and
beta blockade and her goal inr will be 2.0-3.0. At the time of
dishcarge, she remains in sinus rhythm. She should have f/u w/
dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as outlined in discharge instructiions and also
w/ device clinic for interoggation of pacer.

3. ARF: On admission, BUN/Cr was 63/1.7, up from baseline Cr of
1.1-1.3.  The FENa was 0.3% indicating likely prerenal. She was
given gentle hydration and her ACEI (lisinopril) was initially
held (restarted after renal failure resolved).  While on the
floor, her Cr decreased to baseline. As mentioned above, she was
felt to be in failure necessitating transfer to the icu. She has
tolerated aggressive diuresis w/o bumps in creatinine.

4. CHF: On admission, the patient had no evidence of CHF.  ACEI
and norvasc were held due to decreased BP (90/60). As noted from
her PMH, she has a history of EF 30% with severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**]
AR.  Trop were mildly elevated and stable at 0.1-0.09, with
negative MBs, and felt to be [**12-23**] ARF. She was continued on ASA,
lipitor, but plavix was held.  She was started on heparin drip,
and ACEI and imdur were gradually added back. Repeat Echo showed
severe MR, [**Month/Day (2) 1192**] AR, and worsened EF compared with an Echo
from [**12-25**]. As mentioned above and below, pt had episode of acute
resp decompensation necessitating transfer to MICU early in
hospital course. At this point, CXR c/w worsening pulmonary
edema. At the time, she was also in rapid afib. In the ICU, she
did not require invasive resp support and was aggressively
diuresed w/ iv lasix 40 iv bid. She was negative 6 liters total
upon transfer from the ICU.  Gentle diuresis was continued on
the floor. Rate control will be crucial for her and she will
continue on Toprol 150 qd and remains on Lisinopril 40 qd. The
morning following her dccv, she had a brief acute hypoxic resp
decompensation. She was quickly stabilized. It was felt that
this may have been secondary to transient worsening CHF in the
setting of recent cardioversion. Pt stabilized w/ continued
diuresis and she will be discharged on oral lasix 80 mg qd.

5. Mental status: The patient had one episode of sun-downing
during her ICU stay, it resolved in the morning.

6. DM: Initially placed on Insulin GTT, then changed to Insulin
SS with NPH. Her NPH was increased during her admission for
hyperglycemia. Current regimen is NPH 25 units qam and NPH 6
units qpm.

7. CAD: continued ASA, toprol, lipitor, ACEI.  The initial
troponin leak was thought to be in the setting of CHF flare with
some renal failure. Pt has refused catheterization in the past.

8. Carotid artery disease: continued ASA

9.  Anemia: Pt was initially transfused 1 U PRBC which
?precipitated CHF flare.  Hematocrit was kept >28 during
hospitalization.

***10. Code: Should be addressed w/ PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Still remains
vague. At this point, pt does not wish for heroic measures to
prolong her life. However, she was not against intubation. Based
upon discussions w/ PCP and pt, pt is DNR but ok for intubation.
Obviously, prolonged course on vent would need to be discussed
further.
