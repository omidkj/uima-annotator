none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]yoW with pmh sig for CVA, seizures, recent UTI
who was found to have slurred speech and later on to be non
responsive at rehab. Pt was seen by her son-in law at rehab at
9am and he noted that she seemed confused. Shortly thereafter,
according to RN at rehab, she was found asleep in bed only
awakening briefly to sternal rub. No seizure activity was noted.
Of note, she was hospitalized one week prior with seizures in
the setting of a UTI and her seizures in teh past manefest as
staring followed by [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis. No fever or chills had
been noted at rehab, no cough or diarrhea. Per daughter, pt was
"almost back to baseline" and walked 50 yards in her walker the
night before.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2140-3-1**] 10:25 PM
Pneumonic infiltrate in left mid lung zone, suspicion for
pleural effusion on the left side. ETT too close to carina and
withdrawal by a few centimeters is recommended. This film is
first seen and interpreted at 1:15 p.m. on [**3-3**]. Thus no
telephone message was sent to recommend adjustment of ETT
position.
.
[**2140-3-2**] EEG This is an abnormal EEG due to the left temporal
sharp
waves and theta slowing, as well as the slow background rhythm.
The
first abnormality indicates left temporal cortical
hypersynchrony
(possibly related to epilepsy), while the second abnormality
suggests left temporal subcortical dysfunction. The third
abnormality suggests a mild encephalopathy, which may be seen
with infections, toxic metabolic abnormalities, medication
effect or neurodegenerative disorders.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2140-3-4**] 7:39 PM
No prior for comparison. The study is limited by motion despite
several attempts at acquisition. Within the limits of the study,
no hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or large
intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage is identified. No definite
major vascular territorial infarct is identified. Diffuse
hypodensities seen in both corona radiata and centrum semiovale
indicating chronic microvascular disease. Imaged paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells appear clear. Middle ear cavities
are aerated. No fractures identified.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect on
this somewhat limited study.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2140-3-4**] 2:41 PM
FINDINGS: Collapse consolidation within the left lower lobe is
again seen. Bilateral pleural effusions are now present and I
suspect that the degree of failure has occurred.
IMPRESSION: Collapse consolidation left lower lobe. Small
bilateral effusions suggesting some failure.
.
[**2140-3-7**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best  excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The
estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global  and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation with mildly thickened leaflets.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with a history of AFib, CVA, and seizures, from rehab
with recent UTI and seizures, who had an acute event od AMS and
slurred speach leading to intubation for altered mental status
and transient hypotension requiring pressors.
.
In the MICU became persistently hypotensive, started on
levophed. Question of sedation vs sepsis. CXR with questionable
pneumonia, started on vanc/levo/flagyl. Vanc stopped with no
growth on cultures. The next morning pt was extubated [**3-2**],
improved BP, and was successfully taken off pressors. Course
complicated only by delerium and AF with rate 120s. Patient
started on low dose Beta blocker, given concern for hypotension.
Tachy Brady syndrome in the past with digoxin hence its
discontinuation. EEG [**3-2**] abnormal EEG due to the left temporal
sharp waves and theta slowing, as well as the slow background
rhythm, concerning for epilepsy, and evidence of encephalopathy.
In discussion with neurology, no active seizing. Patient on
dilantin and Keppra.
.
#AMS: Question whether related to seizure-post ictal state,
which is the likely etiology of presenting symptoms. Head CT at
OSH was reportedly negative. Infection, Afib with hypotension,
or symptomatic bradycardia may have been the inciting incident.
EEG abnormal but with no active seizure activity as per
neurology. Infection likely lowered seizure threshold. Pt was
treated with vanc/levo/flagyl then levo/flgayl [**3-6**] day 6. Rate
control Afib with low dose beta blocker with caution for
bradycardia and hypotension. Re-imaged with CT head w/o contrast
to rule out bleed given daughter stated pt acute change in
mental status when called out from the MICU. Chronic
macrovascular change with no evidence of bleed. Low dose haldol
and [**11-16**] sitter. [**3-5**], alert and oriented with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
periods.
Appears delirium superimposed on baseline dementia, waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] periods.
