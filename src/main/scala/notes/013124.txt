Service:  MICU


The patient was admitted on [**2112-3-9**]. The patient
expired on [**2112-3-11**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was an 82-year-old
female, with a history of smoking, who presented as a
transfer from an outside hospital for bronchoscopy and stent
placement. The patient was admitted to an outside hospital in
[**2112-2-2**] complaining of [**2-5**] days of a nonproductive cough,
as well as increasing dyspnea, mainly on exertion. The
patient had an x-ray done which was suspicious for a right
lower lobe infiltrate and was admitted to the hospital for
treatment of pneumonia. A CT scan done during the
hospitalization showed right lower lobe and middle lobe post
obstructive consolidation. There was also a complete
obliteration of the right bronchus intermedius and narrowing
and constriction of the right pulmonary artery. There were
multiple small nodules in the right upper lobe and several
left sided ground glass nodules. It was thought that these
findings were likely secondary to cancer, although other
granulomatous disease was also possible. The patient was seen
by a pulmonologist at the outside hospital, and it was felt
that there was a probable endobronchial mass consistent with
lung cancer with obstruction in the right lower lobe, as well
as left mainstem bronchi compression and pulmonary artery
compression. At that time, the plan was to proceed with
outpatient bronchoscopy.
The patient came in to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2112-3-8**] for a flexible
bronchoscopy. This bronchoscopy showed obstruction of the
bronchus intermedius and lower lobe, with severe tumor
involvement of the carina, as well as right and left sided
involvement. Secondary to tumor involvement, there was
narrowing of the left mainstem bronchus to 5 mm. The patient
was then taken to the operating room for a rigid
bronchoscopy. Balloon dilatation and stent placement were
performed in the left mainstem bronchus. The patient remained
intubated after the procedure due to the severity of the
condition and a prolonged procedure and was transferred to
the medical ICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Pneumonia.
2.  COPD.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Combivent inhaler.
2.  Calcium.
3.  Vitamin D.
4.  Multivitamins.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a heavy smoker quitting 2
years ago. No history of alcohol or IV drug use. She lived
alone and had 4 children.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was
afebrile, with a blood pressure of 91/56, heart rate of 84,
respiratory rate of 18, and O2 sat of 98%. General: The
patient was a frail elderly woman lying in bed intubated.
HEENT exam: Normocephalic and atraumatic with pupils equally
round and reactive. Sclerae anicteric and oropharynx clear,
with the ET tube in place. Lungs: Crackles bilaterally and
coarse breath sounds. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended,
with normal active bowel sounds. Extremities showed no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Extremities were warm and well
perfused.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC showed a white count of 12.6,
hematocrit of 44 and platelets of 344. Chem 7 was within
normal limits. Initial ABG was pH 7.38, PCO2 of 41, and PAO2
of 68 on assist control with a tidal volume of 400,
respiratory rate of 16, PEEP of 8 and FIO2 of 0.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory failure: The patient's
respiratory failure was secondary to extensive lung cancer
and bronchial obstruction. During the bronchoscopy, she did
have a stent placed in the left mainstem bronchus. Due to her
extensive malignancy, it was felt that her prognosis would be
very poor. It was also likely that she would be able to be
extubated successfully. Family discussion was conducted and
the patient's poor prognosis was relayed to the family. At
this time, it was decided to make the patient Comfort
Measures Only. Per the family's wishes, the patient was
extubated and started on a morphine drip for comfort. This
was done on the afternoon of [**2112-3-10**]. The patient died
on [**2112-3-11**] at 5:20 a.m. At that time, she was
unresponsive to voice or pain. Pupils were fixed and dilated.
There were no breath or heart sounds. The patient was
pronounced dead at 5:20 a.m. The patient's so was present at
the time of death and the daughter was notified by the son. A
post mortem examination was declined by the family.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Lung cancer.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient expired.
