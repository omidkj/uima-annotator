palpitations

IVC filter

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old male with a past medical history
significant for cholangiocarcinoma (unresectable and s/p chemo
w/ gemcitabine and cisplatin), hypertension, and recent GIB
(ischemic v. infectious colitis) who presents with SVT to 180s
from clinic.
.
The patient was in his usual state of health, with chronic
abdominal pain, and was seen today in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
a third round of chemotherapy. While sitting in the chair in the
waiting room, he felt his heart beat "fast." There he was found
to have SVT to 180s and was sent to the ED. His BP at the time
was 102/60. He denies any chest pain, cough, shortness of
breath, lightheadedness, nausea, or vomiting. At baseline, he
ambulates independently and without dyspnea on exertion. Of
note, he also denies noticing any lower extremity edema, fevers,
chills, diarrhea, constipation, melena or BRBPR. He endorses
~30lb weight loss over the course of 3 months.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: HR in 170s. Vagal maneuver was
attempted and failed. He was given adenosine 6mg and converted
to sinus tachycardia. He remained persistantly tachycardic to
120s and so a CTA was done that showed bilateral subsegmental
PEs. His labs were notable for negative CE, leukocytosis of
12.4, hgb/hct 9.9/29.9. On exam he was guaiac neg. Heme/onc was
consulted and recommended heparin gtt without bolus. VS on
transfer were: 109, 124/96, 25, 100% on 2L.
.
Notably, he was recently hospitalized ([**Date range (1) 84012**]) for BRBPR s/p
colonoscopy significant for segmental colitis with biopsies
suggestive of ischemic vs infectious colitis. On that admission,
he developed a fever 2 days and CT scan showed likely colitis;
he was treated with Cipro, Flagyl, and Asacol (which was
discontinued recently by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9916**]. He did not receive any
blood products at that time, and his hct on discharge was 27.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of
breath. Denied chest pain or tightness. Denied nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation. No recent change in bowel or bladder
habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.


Past Medical History:

edema, neg pain on dorsiflexion

Pertinent Results:
CTA
1. Bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolism
without evidence of right heart strain.
2. Nodular mural atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta with
configuration worrisome for future embolization.
3. Hypoenhancing infiltrative hepatic mass extending into the
porta hepatis and left hepatic lobe compatible with known
cholangiocarcinoma. Associated biliary obstruction again noted.
4. Increasing ascites with persistent multiple nodular
peritoneal implants.
5. Persistent pancreatic ductal dilation.

ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. There is a 2x2 cm echodensity
posterior to the left atrium (cine loop 52), probably in the
posterior mediastinum. It is outside the heart and anatomically
could be associated with the esophagus or the surrounding
structures. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Very
small pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. No right atrial or right ventricular
diastolic collapse is seen.

IMPRESSION: Very small pericardial effusion without signs of
tamponade. Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant
valvular disease seen. Probable extracardiac posterior
mediastinal mass.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-12-20**],
cardiac findings are similar. The extracardiac mass was not
appreciated on the prior study. Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
at 1650 hours on the day of the study.

Ultrasound LE:
Occlusive DVT in one of the two right posterior tibial veins. R
[**Doctor Last Name **] V patent.  No other thrombus noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
57M with cholangiocarcinoma (unresectable and s/p chemo w/
gemcitabine and cisplatin), hypertension, and recent GIB
(ischemic v. infectious colitis) who presents with SVT to 180s
from clinic and was found to have bilateral subsegmental PEs and
right LE DVT. Initially admitted to the ICU for monitoring and
then transferred to the oncology service.
.
# Pulmonary Embolism / DVT: Patient was started on heparin gtt
for bilateral subsegmental PE noted on CTA and DVT on LENI then
switched to lovenox SQ. She had IVC filter placed today due to
hx of GI bleed and th
