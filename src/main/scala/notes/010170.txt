Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old
gentleman who was admitted to the [**Hospital6 649**] as a transfer from the [**Hospital6 46354**].  Prior to admission, he had a long and complicated
hospital course at the outside hospital.  His hospital course
began on [**2111-1-8**] when he underwent a right carotid
endarterectomy for 95% stenosis of the carotid artery.

His postoperative course was complicated by nonspecific T
wave changes consistent with myocardial infarction
postoperatively as well as hematoma formation.  The hematoma
formation was rapidly expanding and he received an emergent
surgical airway in the Intensive Care Unit.  This emergent
cricothyroidotomy was converted then to a formal
tracheostomy.

During his subsequent hospital course, he had an additional
CHF exacerbation.  He was medically managed and eventually
his tracheostomy was decannulated.  However, just prior to
admission to [**Hospital6 256**] he had
another acute decompensation with CHF exacerbation.  This
necessitated emergent intubation.  With EKG changes
consistent with myocardial infarction, he was transferred to
the [**Hospital6 256**] for further
management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes type 2 treated with oral medication.
2.  Cerebrovascular disease, status post left carotid
endarterectomy in [**2105**].
3.  Status post right cerebrovascular accident in [**2106**] with
residual left-sided weakness.
4.  Status post right carotid endarterectomy on [**2111-1-8**].
5.  Fall from standing on [**2110-12-24**] with resultant
displaced radial fracture which was reduced, closed, and
casted.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Coronary artery disease.  No history of catheterization
prior to admission to the [**Hospital6 2018**].
8.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
2.0 to 2.7.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER THE [**Hospital1 18**]:
1.  Lovenox 1 mg per kilogram subcutaneously b.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
6.  Captopril 6.25 mg q.i.d.
7.  Lasix drip at 2 per hour.
8.  Versed drip.
9.  TPN.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  This is a gentleman who
is intubated, comfortable, with minimal sedation.  He was
afebrile with a temperature of 99.1.  His pulse was in the
70s, blood pressure 119/58.  He was breathing 12 per minute
and saturating 98%.  His CVP is ranging from [**6-21**].  He was
intubated and has a nasogastric tube.  His neck has a
well-healed right carotid endarterectomy scar.  There is also
a well-healing tracheostomy scar.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The heart was regular with an S1
and S2.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  The extremities were without
edema.  The left arm was in a cast.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the CCU at the
[**Hospital6 256**].  Upon admission, he was
treated for his pneumonia.  He was medically managed for CHF
and underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2111-1-29**].
His catheterization revealed 70% stenosis of the distal left
main coronary artery, 90% stenosis of the LAD, 80% stenosis
of the circumflex, 90% stenosis of OM2 and a proximally
occluded right coronary artery.

After reviewing cardiac catheterization data, a consultation
was made with Cardiothoracic Surgery who deemed that he was a
good candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting.  Over the
ensuing days, Mr. [**Known lastname **] CHF was managed by the CCU Team and
he received treatment for what was now determined to be a
Klebsiella pneumonia.  He was treated with a full course of
Zosyn.

On [**2111-2-3**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] went to the Operating Room with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**].  He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft of
four vessels.  He had a saphenous vein graft to his LAD and
diagonal in a sequential fashion, saphenous vein graft to his
PDA and a saphenous vein graft to his OM.  The procedure was
performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] and assisted by Dr.
.....................  The patient tolerated the procedure
well without complication and was transferred to the Cardiac
Surgery Recovery Unit without complication.  Please see the
previously dictated operative note for more details.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a long postoperative course.  His postoperative
course was complicated by hypertension which was managed
medically.  During his postoperative course, he did not
suffer from any arrhythmias nor did he have any episode of
hypotension.  At the time of discharge, he was on a stable
antihypertensive regimen appropriate for someone with a
decreased ejection fraction.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] had had a long protracted period of intubation prior
to the operation.  The status of Mr. [**Known lastname **] pulmonary system
necessitated a prolonged postoperative intubation.  After a
very slow wean from ventilatory support, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
successfully extubated on postoperative day number nine.  He
continued to be very tenuous from a pulmonary point of view
and required frequent chest PT.  For this reason, Mr. [**Known lastname **]
was kept in the Intensive Care Unit where very close
monitoring could be performed.

In addition, he had chest PT performed at very regular
intervals by the ICU staff.  His pulmonary status was so
tenuous that we were unable to transfer him to the regular
patient care floor during his hospitalization.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an emergent cricothyroidotomy followed by a
formal tracheostomy at the outside hospital.  There is much
scarring surrounding his larynx.  Such a situation frequently
makes it very difficult to swallow without aspirating.  As is
expected, Mr. [**Known lastname **] failed a swallowing study early on in his
[**Hospital 46355**] hospital course.  The study was repeated and
yet again Mr. [**Known lastname **] was unable to swallow without evidence of
aspiration.

After a prolonged period of being fed via nasogastric tube,
Mr. [**Known lastname **] finally had a formal percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube placed in the Intensive Care Unit.  This was
performed on [**2111-2-24**], postoperative day number 21.
This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 954**] and assisted
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The procedure was performed under
endoscopic guidance in the Intensive Care Unit without
complication.  Please see the previously dictated operative
note for more details.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 18095**] a distal radius fracture prior to arriving
to the hospital.  This injury had been reduced and casted at
the outside institution.  Postoperatively, there was much
edema associated in the postoperative course from coronary
artery bypass grafting.  His cast was removed by the
Orthopedic Service in anticipation of this edema and to avoid
compartment syndrome.  The cast was replaced by a plaster
splint.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] should follow-up with his orthopedic
surgeon in the [**Hospital1 **] for reassessment of his injury and
possible removal of the splint.

By postoperative day number 23, Mr. [**Known lastname **] pulmonary status
was deemed sufficiently stable.  His hypertension was well
controlled and he was tolerating tube feeds.  At this point,
he was ready to be discharged to rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft, four vessels.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Klebsiella pneumonia.
4.  Failed swallow study status post percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube placement.
5.  Central line culture positive for coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus aureus, status post a 14 day treatment with
vancomycin and removal of the line.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Methylphenidate 5 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4.  Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Miconazole powd
