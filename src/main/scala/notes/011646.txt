Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
biliary tract obstruction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Gastroduodenotomy
Roux-en-Y with Cholecystoenterotomy
Bile Duct Biopsy
Placement of Cyber-knife Seeds


History of Present Illness:
This 85-year-old gentleman has been worked up extensively by me
in the last month for a persistent biliary tract obstruction
which has plagued him
for the last 5-6 months. He presented with jaundice and had an
indwelling biliary stent placed to relieve this. Malignant
appearing stricture has been worked up extensively by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who has indicated he felt this was a malignant process.
However, we were unable to obtain brushings or biopsies to
confirm this through multiple interventional approaches in the
bile duct. Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a 30 pound weight loss as well as
anorexia and intermittent abdominal pain. Prior to this, he had
been a pretty vibrant man but clearly
he was suffering over the last [**11-19**] year.

I reviewed his images which showed a distended gallbladder with
very large stone within it which was compressing directly on the
duodenum as well as the bile duct. There was a suggestion of a
Mirizzi's syndrome type of problem from the ERCP as well as the
CT scan. However, his CA19-9 level was up at 68 and his ERCP
images were more suggestive of malignancy. Mr. [**Known lastname **] also
suffered an episode of stent cholangitis within the last month
and because of this, we collectively decided to take him to the
operating room to get a definitive
diagnosis as well as to hopefully treat the biliary tract
obstruction.


Past Medical History:
depression, hypertension, coronary artery disease status post
PTCA and 3 stent placements, osteoarthritis, colon
resection, bilateral total knee replacement, benign prostatic
hypertrophy, Parkinson's disease, REM behavior disorder,
obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movements and excessive
daytime sleepiness

PSH: bilateral total knee replacement briefly complicated by
some mild confusion in the PACU; complication of a previous ERCP
with stent change resulted in mild heart failure during his last
hospitalization

non smoker, no alcohol or drug use

DIAGNOSIS:

I. Celiac lymph node (A):
1. Adenocarcinoma, well differentiated, in fibroadipose tissue.
2. No lymph node tissue.
II. Gallstone; gross examination:
Gallstone (3.5 cm), mixed-type.
III. Bile duct (B):
Adenocarcinoma, well differentiated.
Note: The tumor is morphologically consistent with a biliary
origin.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2116-6-26**] 5:15 AM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-19**] and 9.
Mediastinal vascular engorgement has improved since [**6-25**].
Lungs are grossly clear. Heart size top normal. Lateral aspect
of the left lower chest is excluded from the study. The other
pleural surfaces are normal. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper
stomach, but would need to be advanced at least 4 cm to move all
the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Right
jugular line tip projects over the mid SVC. No pneumothorax or
appreciable pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 85-year-old gentleman has been worked up extensively for a
persistent biliary tract obstruction. He went to the OR for:
1. Cholecystoenterostomy with Roux-en-Y formation.
2. Gastroenterostomy.
3. Celiac lymph node biopsy.
4. Fiducial gold seed placement for cyber knife therapy.

He remained in the ICU over night for close monitoring. Cardic
enzymes were cycled and negative. His volume status was
monitored and he was transfered out to the floor the next day.

Pain: He had an epidural for pain control. He was then switched
to IV Morphine PRN. Once tolerating a diet, he was transitioned
to PO meds.

Post-op confusion: He initially had some post-op diorientation.
Family members helped orient him and he became calmer and
oriented the further out from surgery.

GI/Abd: He was NPO, with IVF and a NGT. The NGT remained in
place until POD 3. His diet was slowly advanced thereafter. He
was tolerating a regular diet at time of discharge and reported
+flatus and +BM.
His staples were removed and steri strips applied. There was
some minimal spotty drainage on the right side that was covered
with gauze. It did not look angry, red and did not need to be
opened.

CV: He did not have any cardiac issue post-op. He continued on
his Lopressor. His Plavix was restarted on POD 3.

PT: [**Name (NI) **] was seen by PT and rehab was recommended.

Pathology: Celiac lymph node (A): 1. Adenocarcinoma, well
differentiated, in fibroadipose tissue. 2. No lymph node tissue.
II. Gallstone. III. Bile duct (B):
Adenocarcinoma, well differentiated. Note: The tumor is
morphologically consistent with a biliary origin.
This information was not yet discussed with the patient. The
family does know and a meeting will be held in clinic.

Geriatrics was following along closely and helped manage his
overall post-op care, including to minimize delirium and
infection risk.
