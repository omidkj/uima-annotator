HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 94664**] is an 85-year-old
man with a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, insulin-dependent
diabetes times 60 years, and peripheral vascular disease,
status post a fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass, who came to the Emergency
Department with an episode of substernal chest pain at
11:30 a.m. on [**8-18**].  The patient tried Milk of Magnesia
and sublingual nitroglycerin times two without relief.  The
patient also had nitroglycerin drip and oxygen, and the pain
was relieved.  The patient denied any shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, or syncope on the day of the episode.  The
patient was a poor historian and a bit confused during the
history taking.

As per the history, this was the patient's first episode of
chest pain.  He denied cough, fever, and chills.  He does
have some difficulty hearing.  Currently, at the time of
admission, denies any chest pain, shortness of breath or
palpitations and was admitted to the C-MED Service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in
the area of his right lower leg wound from his fem-[**Doctor Last Name **]
bypass.  He finished a course of vancomycin on [**8-17**].
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypothyroidism, on Synthroid.
4.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
5.  Hyponatremia.
6.  Peripheral vascular disease, status post right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **]
bypass surgery.
7.  Hypoglycemia.

[**Doctor Last Name **] ON ADMISSION:  [**Doctor Last Name **] on admission include
insulin NPH 4 units q.d., vitamin B12, vitamin C, Synthroid,
and Lopressor.

ALLERGIES:  Allergic to ASPIRIN; it causes a rash.  He is
allergic to PENICILLIN.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives alone at [**Hospital3 2558**].  He has a
son.  [**Name (NI) **] has occasional alcohol use.  He quit smoking around
65 years ago.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  His vital signs were a
temperature of 100.6, pulse 84, blood pressure 80/50, and he
was satting 97% on 2 liters.  Generally, he is an 85-year-old
male lying comfortably, in no acute distress.  Lungs revealed
he had pectus excavatum.  His lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  His neck revealed he had a
positive jugular venous distention, supple.  Heart revealed
distant heart sounds.  Abdomen was soft and nontender,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities with 2+ edema.
Neurologically, alert and oriented times two (to time and
place).

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Laboratories on admission were
a white blood cell count of 8.1, hematocrit 32,
platelets 368.  Sodium 136, potassium 4.4, chloride 100,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 24, creatinine 0.7, glucose 118.  His
first creatine kinase was 191.  Second creatine kinase
was 512 with a MB fraction of 16, index of 3.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram showed a regular rate
and rhythm at 110 beats per minute, low voltage with a right
bundle-branch block.

Chest x-ray showed pleural effusions bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT:  Initial assessment was that he was an
85-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular
disease, hypertension, and hypothyroidism who was admitted
for an episode of chest pain relieved by sublingual
nitroglycerin.  This is his first episode of chest pain, and
was considered to be possibly likely to ischemia especially
given rising creatine kinases.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was begun on heparin, aspirin,
continued on Lopressor, and taken to the C-MED Service.  The
patient was eventually diagnosed with a non-Q-wave myocardial
infarction with a creatine phosphokinase of 645 and a
troponin of 3.  He was asymptomatic.  However, on the night
following admission he had a systolic blood pressure in the
80s and 90s, and on the following admission was called for an
episode of rapid atrial fibrillation with a rate in the 150s
complicated by hypotension with blood pressures in the 60s to
70s systolic.  He was still mentating at baseline at that
time.  He had a semi-elective cardioversion at 360 joules
times three which was unsuccessful.  He was resuscitated with
approximately 2 liters of normal saline but had no effect on
his blood pressure or heart rate, and the patient was
admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for amiodarone
intravenously in an attempt to re-cardiovert him was planned.

On arrival at the Coronary Care Unit team, the patient was in
atrial fibrillation with a rate of 150, systolic blood
pressure of 60 to 70 on an amiodarone drip.

The patient was continued on amiodarone drip and was placed
on a dopamine drip as well for support of blood pressure.  He
then reverted spontaneously to normal sinus rhythm with the
amiodarone drip and dopamine; however, at that point his
heart rate was in the 30s to 50s, and he was started on
Levophed.  The patient also had an echocardiogram which
showed left ventricular ejection fraction of about 10% with
was significantly decreased from an ejection fraction of
about 50% on a recent hospitalization.  The patient continued
after being weaned from pressors with a normal sinus rhythm
at around 80 with a systolic blood pressure in the 90s, and
he was transferred out to the floor for expected titration of
his heart failure [**Name (NI) 4982**], and at that time the decision
was made not to continue him on long-term amiodarone since
this was his first event of atrial fibrillation.

However, on [**8-21**], the Coronary Care Unit team was called
again to see the patient early in the morning when he
re-developed rapid atrial fibrillation with a rate of 180,
and again with hypotension with a systolic rate in the 50s
and 60s.  The patient was again transferred to the Coronary
Care Unit and reloaded with intravenous amiodarone.  He was
cardioverted times two unsuccessfully.  Then he spontaneously
cardioverted to a junctional rhythm and then a sinus rhythm
with a rate of about 40 to 50 beats per minute, and a
systolic pressure in the 60s.  At this time,
Electrophysiology was called, and they elected to place a
temporary wire in the coronary sinus to maintain and adequate
baseline heart rate, although they had to set the pacer at
maximum output in order to capture.  During this time, the
patient had to be intubated for airway protection and
hypotension in the setting of sedation.

Upon discussion with the team it was decided that the patient
did not tolerate rapid atrial fibrillation or sinus
bradycardia.  They decided to place a permanent DDD pacemaker
after multiple discussions with the patient and the family.
There was some thought to also pursuing a AV node ablation to
reduce his rapid atrial fibrillation causing ventricular
rapid response rate.  However, it was eventually decided not
to go ahead and do that procedure.

He was restarted on his heart failure therapy with captopril
and digoxin.  He was diuresed, and eventually the patient was
able to go back to the regular medical floor.  The patient
was also transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells for
a decreasing hematocrit.  The patient was also started on
Plavix for his coronary artery disease since he gets a rash
when he takes aspirin.  The patient was able to be extubated
on [**2106-8-23**], and tolerated it well.  He did have a bit
of swelling at the site of his left artery line which was
removed; however, he continued to have dopplerable left
radial pulse and palpable left ulnar pulse.  This pain
eventually resolved with continued good blood flow to the
hand.  The patient was continued on p.o. amiodarone
throughout this time.  The patient also continued to have
significant lower extremity 3 to 4+ pitting edema as well as
dependent edema in his arm as well as enlarging bilateral
pleural effusions seen on chest x-ray.

The patient again was transferred out to the regular medical
floor on [**8-24**] and continued diuresis with Lasix and on
amiodarone for rate control.

On [**8-26**], the house officers were called to see the
patient with an increased heart rate and decreased systolic
blood pressure.  He was again in rapid atrial fibrillation
with a heart rate of around 120 and a blood pressure of
76/50.  His electrocardiogram sho
