Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 31611**] is a 75 year old male with a history of hemorrhagic
stroke 2 months ago admitted for shortness of breath.  He was
noted by VNA to have labored breathing and was found to be
hypoxic at home to 70s on RA.
.
He was initially taken to [**Location (un) 620**], where CTA showed massive
bilateral PEs.  He was also found to be in A. fib with RVR which
resolved with oxygen, but no nodal agents. He was started on a
nitropaste and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
Patient reports that that he has had 2-3 weeks of RLE edema, but
was without SOB, CP, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena,
hematemasis.  Reports he is up to date on colonoscopy and PSA
and carries no cancer diagnosis.  Patient reports he was highly
mobile over the summer, but over the past 2-3 months has been
primarily bedbound due to sciatica symptoms and deconditioning
after recent stroke.  Was prescribed lasix for LE edema by PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
few weeks ago.  Also of note, patient underwent dental
extraction of 7 teeth last week.
.
In the ED, his vitals were 82, 108/92, 24, 96% on NRB.  He got a
CXR which showed no acute process.  He got LENIs with showed LLE
DVT.


Past Medical History:
Left internal capsule lacunar infarct [**2180**]
Hemmoragic stroke [**2185**]
Hypertension
Lumbar disc disease
Hypercholesterolemia
BPH- s/p TURP
.

Social History:
Patient previously work for Schering Plough in sales.  Currently
with limited activity, bedbound secondary to sciatica and recent
stroke, but was very active until 4 months ago.  Rare tobacco
use in his youth but currently non-smoker.  Rare wine use.

[**10-17**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

[**10-17**] LENIS: IMPRESSION: Acute deep venous thrombosis within the
left distal superficial
femoral vein and extending into the popliteal and posterior
tibial veins as
described. No deep venous thrombosis of the right lower
extremity.

[**10-18**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast with maneuvers. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal systolic function. Findings consistent
with pulmonary emboli. No ASD or PFO identified.

[**10-17**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with frequent premature beats, probably
atrial premature beats
with aberrant conduction. Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2186-8-21**] rhythm is similar, T wave
inversions in
leads V1-V3 are now present. Cannot exclude ischemia.

[**10-18**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: No evidence of recent hemorrhage.
Subtle hyperattenuation in
region of prior left basal ganglia/internal capsule parenchymal
hemorrhage.

Foot XRay: IMPRESSION: Soft tissue swelling. No fracture
identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 31611**] is a 75 year old male with recent
hemorrhagic stroke, HTN, BPH, HL, admitted for bilateral PE and
LLE DVT.
.
Pulmonary Embolism. Patient found to have bilateral central PEs
and LLE DVT.  IVC filter placed and anticoagulation with heparin
initiated in spite of recent hemorrhagic stroke (2 months ago)
after discussion with neurology who recommended anticoagulation.
 Patient remained hemodyamically stable and was weaned off
supplemental oxygen during hospital stay.   Echo showed evidence
of RV strain and he was found to have elevated BNP on admission.
 Etiology of PE likely secondary to prolonged immobility; no
history of malignancy or prior clots. He was bridged to Coumadin
prior to discharge and had therapeutic INR for 2 days prior to
discontinuation of heparin drip.
.
H/o CVA.  History of hemorrhagic and ischemic CVA with minimal
residual deficits.  He was followed by neurology during hospital
stay.  Head CT on admission showed no acute event.
.
HTN. Patient continue on lisinopril and felodipine.
.
BPH.  S/p turp.  He was continued on finasteride.
.
Hyperlipidemia.  He was continued on ezetemibe and simvastatin.
.
Left foot/toe pain: Pt c/o pain over dorsum of left foot/toes.
He did not have any focal tenderness or erythema. XR only showed
soft tissue swelling and no fracture. He had edema in left foot,
likely [**1-14**] DVT. He was given 0.5 tab Vicodin with good effect as
needed for toe pain in hospital which was improved at time of
discharge.
