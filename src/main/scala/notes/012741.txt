History of Present Illness:
73yo man with history of squamous cell ca of head/neck s/p
resection and XRT presented with sepsis amd respiratory
failure.He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] for syncope thought to
be from orthostasis.He was found to be anemic and workup
revealed duodenal ulcer(cauterised and injected) and GI
bleeding. He was also found to have MRSA pneumonia for which he
was started on levofloxacin and then converted to nafcillin for
which he completed 14d course on [**2135-11-20**]. He also had pleural
effusion which was tapped and found to have reaccumulated. No
further treatment was deemed necessary at that time. At
[**Hospital1 **], treated with timentin for pnuemonia. On [**2135-12-20**],  He
was sent to ED for fever, hypotension and hypoxia. Initial vital
signs reveals fever to 103.2 and hypotensive to 80/40 and desat
to 80's% on 35% trach mask. His BP responded to 3L NS. His trach
was changed to #4 Shiley and he was put on ventilator with PS
[**9-19**] because he appears to be tiring out. He was started on
vanco/levo/flagyl for CXR concerning for LLL opacity. MUST
protocol was not initiated.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2135-12-20**]

A tracheostomy tube is seen with tip terminating 4 cm from the
carina. There
is moderate cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration.
The thoracic
aorta is tortuous with mural calcification. There is upper zone
pulmonary
vascular prominence and hazy perihilar opacity. Left pleural
effusion and
left retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the left
hemidiaphragm. No
pneumothorax. The surrounding osseous structures appear
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Cardiomegaly with congestive heart failure.
2. Left pleural effusion.,
3. Left lower lobe opacity suggests possible underlying left
lower lobe
consolidation. Recommend followup PA and lateral chest x-ray
after treatment
to assess resolution.

Brief Hospital Course:
73yo M with squamous cell cancer of head and neck, recently
treated for pneumonia presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for respiratory failure
and sepsis. Chest X-Ray on admission shows posible left lower
lobe consolidation. He was empirically started on vancomycin,
ceftazidime and flagyl. He completed 7days course of ceftazidime
and vancomycin. His sputum culture on admission only grew rare
gram negative rods. His repeat sputum culture on [**2135-12-24**] grew
rare Klebsiella. However, given that he is clinically improving,
this is unlikely a new pneumonia. His tracheostomy tube was
initially changed to #4 Shiley in the ED for ventilation. In the
ICU, this was chaged to #6 Portex on [**2135-12-21**] given that he was
auto-PEEPing. His repiratory distress was also partly
attrributed to his baseline COPD. He was started on
Iptratropium, albuterol and steroid. Given his multiple surgery
and XRT to his head and neck, bronchoscopy was performed on
admission to delineate anatomy and reveals that he has oversewn
tranchea and patent esophagus. Upon discharge, he tolerated
trach mask.

He also has gastrojejunostomy tube which was leaking at the
insertion site. This tube was inserted in [**2124**]. It was presumed
that over time, the insertion site became eroded and thus the
leakage around the tube. Ostomy bag collected yellowish
secretion which has alkaline ph, explaining his metabolic
acidosis. There had been a question of drainage of same fluid
from trach suction. Bronchoscopy was again performed and shows
no fistula. IR procedure was done with successful exchange of 14
french gastrojejunostomy tube with T -fasterner to secure the
insertion site. He tolerated the procedure well with not much
drainage after that.

He also tested positive for clostridium difficile. He will
continue on flagyl for 2 weeks after the completion of his other
antibiotics. Hypertension was a problem when his sepsis
resolved. Blood pressure had been well controlled upon discharge
with metoprolol and amlodipine. He also developed ATN due to
periods of hypotension while he was septic. His creatinine is
currently trending down and he has satisfactory urine output.
All his medication has been renally dosed and should be adjusted
at [**Location (un) 620**] based on renal function. He had been getting
nutrition by tubefeed with promote.

Code status had been discussed with his health care proxy which
is his sister. She confirms full code.
