History of Present Illness:
55 year-old male with hepatitis C cirrhosis s/p liver [**Month/Day/Year **]
with recurrent hepatitis C complicated by ascites/
encephalopathy/ varices (3 cords Grade I varices)/ portal
hypertensive gastropathy/chronic portal and splenic venous
thrombosis, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] yesterday with upper
GI bleed, who presents with recurrent melena. He reports he
arrived home yesterday and ate a seafood salad with several dk
brown stools last night and some abd cramping.  Pt this AM had
black loose stool with abdominal cramping.

The patient was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 30469**] for
melanotic stools. He was admitted to the MICU for hemodynamic
monitoring. GI performed endoscopy on [**2204-5-7**] which showed
non-bleeding esophageal and gastric varices, portal hypertensive
gastropathy, and a bleeding polyp noted in proximal body of
stomach injected with epinephrine with hemostasis, as well as a
colonoscopy on [**2204-5-8**] and old blood. He received 3 U PRBCs, his
Hct remained stable at 27, and he was called out to [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**]
on [**5-9**], where his stools were noted to clear prior to
discharged home.

In the ED, 97.9 77 95/47 18 100% on RA. Pt noted to be alert and
mentating well. NG lavage not performed. Laboratory data
significant for hematocrit 26 (baseline 31) and Cre of 1.4
(baseline 0.8). Patient was noted to become hypotensive to 68
SBP and was treated with 2 L NS given wide open-> response of
SBPs to 90s, and 1 U PRBCs with second unit written for. GI saw
the patient, recommended tagged RBC scan and plan for repeat
EGD. On transfer to MICU, VS were afebrile 63 12 86/40 100%

On the floor vitals were 109/54 HR70 RR18 99%RA, pt reports
feeling well. Reports nonproductive cough, longstanding.

STUDIES:
[**5-11**] RBC Scan:
Delayed imaging shows activity in the midline at the level of
the aortic bifurcation which is likely in small bowel. There was
no active bleeding during the time of imaging.

[**5-12**] KUB:
No evidence of a capsule is seen within the abdomen.
.
[**2204-5-17**]: CTA
1. Multiple variceal vessels are identified in the abdomen. No
active
extravasation of contrast is seen to indicate a site of active
hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged thrombosis of the portal vein, splenic vein, and
superior
mesenteric vein.
3. Fluid in the left abdominal flank is stable in size and
morphology.

[**2204-5-19**]:
GI bleeding study: No evidence of active GI bleeding at the time
of the study.

Brief Hospital Course:
55M with hepatitis C cirrhosis s/p liver [**Month/Day/Year **] with
recurrent hepatitis C complicated by ascites, gastric and
esophageal varices, and encephalopathy admitted with recurrent
melena.

1. LGIB: Reported to have melena, although at different time
noted to have brown stool with bloody mucous. Immediate concern
was for UGIB, particularly variceal bleeding or portal
gastropathy in this patient with decompensated liver disease. Pt
with small intestine ulcers on recent capsule study. EGD on [**5-7**]
with non bleeding varices at the lower third of the esophagus
and gastroesophageal junction, portal hypertensive gastropathy,
polyp in proximal body of stomach, and 8 mm non bleeding polyp
adjacent to hepatico-jejunostomy. The patient had an RBC scan,
which showed no definite bleeding seen on 90 minute dynamic
imaging, but activity in the rectum on left lateral is
compatible with rectal bleeding. Pt had a sigmoidoscopy the next
morning on [**5-12**] that noted blood coating the colon, but no e/o
active bleeding. IR declined angiography at this time, as it
would be very low yield as no bleeding was noted on the RBC
scan. Over the pt's ICU course, he was transfused 5 units pRBCs.
The patient's HCT remained stable at 34 prior to call out to the
floor. On the floor the patient remained hemodynamically stable
however he continued to experience melanotic stools with a
downward trend in his hematocrit. He became transfusion
dependent, requiring about 2units/day. He subsequently had a
CT-A to looked for vascular abnormalities such as scarred
varices however this wa
