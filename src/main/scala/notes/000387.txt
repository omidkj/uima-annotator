Admission Date:  [**2157-2-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2157-5-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2084-7-29**]       Sex:  M

Service:  BLUE [**Doctor First Name 147**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
male with a complicated past surgical history of
appendectomy, multiple exploratory laparotomies for small
bowel obstruction and lysis of adhesions and multiple ventral
hernia repairs, the latest of which resulted in
enterocutaneous fistula through a [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex/Marlex composite
mesh.  The patient was transferred from a hospital in [**Location (un) 7498**] complaining of enterocutaneous fistulae.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Atrial flutter.
4.  Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile
at 97.9 degrees.  The pulse was irregularly irregular at a
rate of 71.  Blood pressure 110/65.  Respiratory rate of 18.
Saturating at 95% on three liters nasal cannula.  The patient
was alert and oriented times three.  Cardiovascular
examination was significant for irregularly irregular rate.
S1, S2.  The lung examination revealed hoarse breath sounds
with transmitted sounds and end expiratory wheezing.  The
abdominal examination had positive bowel sounds.  A Vac
dressing applied over two enterocutaneous fistulae in the
lower quadrants and a third enterocutaneous fistula through
the mesh in the right abdominal area.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White count 8.3, hemoglobin and
hematocrit of 9.7/29.6, platelet count 429,000.  Serum
chemistries:  Sodium 134, potassium 4.7, chloride 96, CO2 30,
BUN 25, creatinine 0.5, glucose 88.  Calcium 8.3, magnesium
1.9, phosphorus 4.7.  AST and ALT 10 and 9 respectively.  Alk
phos was 211.  Total bilirubin was 0.5.  Amylase and lipase
were 108 and 38.  Albumin was 2.2.  PT/PTT were 13.5 and 27.1
respectively with an INR of 1.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A vacuum dressing was put over the
abdominal wound site with enterocutaneous fistulae and
dressing was changed regularly by the surgical team.  The
patient was made NPO and then initially started on TPN via
PICC line that was placed [**2157-2-14**].  G-tube was changed
[**2-15**] and patient was slowed started on J-tube feeding at
one-half strength starting at 20 cc/hr and slowly increased
to a goal rate of 100 cc.  The patient was restarted at
two-thirds strength at 20 cc and rate increased
incrementally.  Nutritional consult follow up was done to
assess caloric count and to make sure that the patient was
receiving adequate nutrition.  The week before surgery the
patient underwent abdominal chest wall preparation with
Hibiclens everyday and was optimized for Operating Room on
[**2157-4-26**].  On [**4-26**] the patient underwent two part
surgery.  The first part was exploratory laparotomy with
removal of [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex and Marlex mesh, lysis of adhesions,
enterectomy, enterostomy and feeding jejunostomy.  During
this surgery, 18 inches of small bowel starting three feet
distally to the ligament of Treitz were removed because the
segment _________ anastomosis of enterocutaneous fistulae.
This first part of the surgery was done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] and
the Blue Surgery team.  The second part of the surgery was
done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the Plastic Surgery team and the
procedures included bilateral muscle flap component
separation, abdominal wall reconstruction with left pedicle
tensor fascia lata fascia and split thickness skin graft of
approximately 440 cm squared.  The patient underwent the two
part surgery without any complication and postoperatively was
transferred to the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit
intubated in stable condition.  On postoperative day one, the
patient was extubated without complications.  The patient was
restarted on tube feeds at one-half strength of 20 cc and it
was advanced in rate.  During his stay in the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit the patient received appropriate
antibiotics and was transferred to the floor on postoperative
day six without any complications.  While on the floor, the
surgical wound had the vacuum dressing changed every other
day by the Plastics Service.  On postoperative day seven, the
patient tolerated clear liquids and was advanced to a regular
diet as tolerated with discontinuation of TPN and tube feed
cycled only during the night.  By discharge, the surgical
wound has granulated beautifully but still requires vacuum
dressing change every other day.  The patient is eating
regular diet with Boost t.i.d. in addition to two-thirds
strength tube feed at 90 cc/hour overnight.

I will now review the rest of the hospital course stay by
system and highlight the most relevant events.

1.  Cardiovascular system:  The patient has a significant
past medical history of coronary artery disease and atrial
fibrillation and atrial flutter with occasional PVCs.  The
patient was put on telemetry and cardiologist consulted.  On
[**2-16**], transthoracic echocardiogram was done which
revealed a normal wall thickness with a left ventricular
cavity and left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than
or equal to 40%.  The right ventricle was noted to be dilated
by the systolic right ventricular function was within normal
limits.  The patient was started on intravenous Lopressor for
rate control and monitored on telemetry.  Postoperatively,
the patient had supraventricular tachycardia and Cardiology
Service was consulted again and this was controlled with
intravenous Lopressor, digoxin and amiodarone.  The patient
was diuresed with intravenous Lasix and did well.  Towards
the end of his hospital stay, the patient had an episode of
bradycardia and this was resolved with discontinuation of
amiodarone and decrease in the dose of Lopressor.

2.  Respiratory system:  The patient has a history of
long-standing severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient was continued on his preadmission medications
which included fluticasone 110 mcg two puffs inhaler b.i.d.,
albuterol nebulizer one treatment q. 3h. p.r.n. and Atrovent
nebulizer treatment one treatment q. 4h. p.r.n. as well as
albuterol one to two puffs inhaler q. 6h. p.r.n.  The patient
was also continued on his p.o. prednisone 5 mg q. day.
During his prolonged hospital stay, the patient has always
had productive sputum and had transmitted sounds on lung
examinations.  The patient underwent chest PT.  Chest x-ray
on [**4-12**] showed questionable right lower lobe infiltrate,
however, clinically patient did not develop any signs or
symptoms of pneumonia.

3.  Renal system:  The patient's creatinine value was 0.5 on
admission and throughout his prolonged hospital stay the
creatinine values stayed within normal limits.

4.  Genitourinary system:  The patient had Foley catheter in
postoperatively to prevent contamination of his skin graft
donor site with urine.  The Foley catheter was eventually
discontinued with healing skin graft donor site and patient
received terazosin q. hs.  The tip of the glans of the penis
had a small ulceration with Foley catheter use.  With
appropriate skin care provided, the ulceration has improved
and Foley catheter was discontinued.

5.  Hematology:  On [**4-11**] to 27th, the patient received two
units of packed red blood cells with a decrease in
hematocrit.  During his operation on [**4-26**] the patient
also received three units of packed red blood cells and three
units of fresh frozen plasma.  Since his operation, his
hematocrit has been stable at a level of 30.2 +/- 1.  The
patient is currently on iron sulfate 325 mg b.i.d.

6.  Endocrine system:  The patient was covered with regular
insulin sliding scale but did not require much dosage.
During his prolonged hospital stay, the patient received
steroids, parenteral and p.o. forms, because of his history
of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and currently
remains on prednisone 5 mg p.o. q. day.

7.  Infectious Disease:  On [**3-3**] patient's Kefzol was
changed to penicillin for presumed local cellulitis around
the abdominal wound site, however, patient remained afebrile.
On [**3-2
