patient, her breathing has become more difficult over the past 4
days but has not been feeling very well over the past few weeks.
Upon arrival to the ED her BP was 210/104 and O2 sat~68% RA. She
was placed on CPAP and was started on a nitro gtt. She was

and cardiac enzymes were negative.
Upon transfer to the MICU her BPs slowly improved with nitro gtt
which was d/c'ed. She was also started on Vancomycin/Levaquin
given her leukocytosis.

Relevant Imaging:
1)Cxray ([**5-19**]): No large pneumothorax. Pulmonary edema.

2)Cxray ([**5-23**]): No radiographic evidence suggestive of volume
overload. Small bilateral pleural effusions and underlying
massive pulmonary arterial hypertension.

3)EKG: sinus @ 64, LAD, nl intervals, TWI II,III,AVF (old),
normalization of T in V5-V6


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 108904**] is a 72yo female with ESRD who presents to ED with
respiratory distress in the setting of hypertension.

1)Respiratory Distress: Patient presented with acute decline in
respiratory status in setting of severely elevated blood
pressures. Initial cxray was consistent with pulmonary edema
which improved with BP control and dialysis. Troponins slightly
elevated in setting of renal insufficiency but no new EKG
changes. She was placed on BIPAP in the ED and this was
continued upon transfer to the MICU. Upon arrival to the floor
she was on NC which was quickly weaned off during the remainder
of her stay. She was followed closely by her nephrologist and
she was dialyzed T, TH, Sat with improvement in her volume
status.

2)Malignant hypertension: Patient presented with extremely
elevated blood pressures on admission. Likely due to fluid
retention with worsening renal function. She was initially
started on a Nitro gtt which was weaned off in the MICU. She was
also started on Clonidine PO and her dose of [**Last Name (un) **] was increased.
Upon transfer to the floor the Clonidine was stopped and she
started on Minoxidil with goal SBP ~140's given her history
vertebral insufficiency. Her blood pressures improved with her
regimen (Lisinopril, Losartan, Clonidine patch, Minoxidil, and
Metoprolol)and dialysis.

3)Leukocytosis: Patient presented with leukocytosis of 20.1
which returned to baseline on [**Last Name (un) **]. She was started on
Levaquin and Vancomycin since she was at risk for an infection
since she has an HD line in place. 1/2 blood culture bottles
grew GPC. She received a 7d course of Levaquin which was stopped
at time of [**Last Name (un) **] and she was given Vancomycin at dialysis.
Surveillance cultures remained negative.

4)ESRD: Patient was followed closely by her primary renal
attending. She was dialyzed 3x/week with improvement in her
blood pressures and volume status.

5)Hypothyroidism: Continued on Levoxyl.

6)Type 2 DM: Patient on Glipizide as outpatient. She was placed
on Glargine and RISS initially on admission since she had been
unable to take adequate PO. Upon transfer to the floor she was
started on Glipizide with appropriate control of her blood
sugars.

7)H/O of SVC stenosis: Anticoagulation was initially held in the
ED but restarted by the MICU team.
