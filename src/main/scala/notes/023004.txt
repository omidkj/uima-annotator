R-Upper Ext. US [**2188-8-12**]:
FINDINGS: The right internal jugular vein demonstrates
appropriate flow and compressibility. The right subclavian vein
where visualized demonstrates appropriate flow. Right axillary,
cephalic, and basilic veins demonstrate appropriate
compressibility and flow. One of the two brachial veins, from
approximately just below the elbow to the mid upper arm between
the elbow and shoulder demonstrates occlusive intraluminal
filling thrombus.
.
IMPRESSION: Deep venous thrombosis seen in the mid to distal
right brachial vein. Remainder of right upper extremity veins
appears patent.
.
Chest X-ray [**2188-8-13**]:
.
COMPARISON: [**2188-8-11**].
.
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of
the right-sided pleural effusion has minimally increased. The
preexisting parenchymal opacity in the right lower lung is of
slightly different distribution but similar extent. Subtle
increase of the retrocardiac atelectasis. Otherwise, there is no
relevant change. The monitoring and
support devices are in unchanged position.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo man with a history of CAD s/p PTCI ([**2180**]) & CABG ([**4-/2188**]),
s/p pacer for junctional bradycardia([**2186**]), afib on coumadin,
and ESRD on HD p/w hypoglycemia and found to have a urinary
tract infection. The patient was admitted to MICU where
hypoglycemia was treated and resolved. The patient found to have
urinary retention; foley was placed that drained pus. Patient
was loaded on gentamicin based on prior urine cultures. He has
several sessions of hemodialysis initially complicated by
hypotension. During the last session of hemodialysis, the
patient maintained his pressures and was felt to be stable for
the floor. The patient did have frequent ectopy and pacer spikes
for which EP was consulted. EP felt pacer was working
appropriately. Patient transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service for further
care. The patient was maintained on his prior medications and
monitored on telemetry. From a cardiac standpoint, the remainder
of his stay was uneventful. Please see UTI and ABDOMINAL PAIN
below.
.
# UTI: Patient c/o abdominal pain and described pain with urge
to urinate. Bladder scan [**Hospital Unit Name 9304**] urinary retention and a foley
was placed. Pus/ thick grey/white was noted coming from the
bladder. The patient's UA was grossly positive. He has a history
of non-fermenter, non-pseudomona (ie stenotrophomonas or
acinetobacter) that is multi-drug resisitent, but sensitive to
gentamicin. He was loaded with gentamicin and dosing continued
by renal. On discharge, he will continue to be renally dosed
with hemodialysis for a goal gent trough of 6 mcg/ml.
.
# HYPOGLYCEMIA: It was felt this may be attributed to new
infection see UTI above. In the hospital, he was covered on
sliding scale insulin.
.
# LOC: Loss of consciousness. Likely from hypoglycemia, but it
was needed to consider [**Hospital Unit Name 4448**] function as well. EP came and
interrogated the pacer which was ok, but monitor continues to
demonstrate ectopy and pace spikes occasionally on the t-waves.
Cardiac enzymes negative despite slight elevated tropinins,
CK-MB negative. Patient was continually monitored on telemetry
without incident.
.
# ESRD: missed HD due to admission. Patient initially with
hypotension with HD for the urgent session and HD session in am
[**8-12**]. However, HD continued thereafter without hypotension.
.
# Afib: We continued coumadin; he was given a dose on [**8-12**] to
catch up back into the theraputic range. He was later discharged
on 1 mg COUMADIN daily to follow-up for further adjustment.
.
# ABDOMINAL PAIN/DIARRHEA - Patient was found to be c.diff
positive. He was started on a fourteen day course of FLAGYL
which he will continue as an outpatient.
.
# HTN: He was continued on carvedilol and lisinopril.
.
