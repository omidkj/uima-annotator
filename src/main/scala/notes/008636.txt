History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 year old woman with multiple sclerosis, paraplegia,

warfarin, who presented to the with headache, fatigue, and
nausea. She says that her headache has been gradually increasing
over the past two days and is described as throbbing, like her
head is going to explode. She denies visual changes or
photophobia but is mostly blind. She denies neck stiffness,
fevers.

Ms. [**Known lastname 100774**] tells me her last bowel movement was Monday (3 days
ago) and was, to her recollection, normal. In particular she
denies bright red blood or black stool. She does endorse
light-headedness for several days. She denies any NSAID use but
does take warfarin and clopidogrel as prescribed.
.
In the ED, 98 106 133/63 18 100% 15L. Patient's labs were
significant for a Hct of 14.7 (baseline 25-28, most recently
checked 1 month ago) and INR 7.6. She was noted to have formed
guaiac negative brown stool on rectal exam. She was given 5mg po
Vit K, and startted on IV protonix . The patient refused NG
lavage. She initially refused head CT head but later consented.
This was normal. CT abdomen was attempted but the patient had a
panic attack in the scanner despite pre-treatment with 2 mg IV
Ativan. She was given 2U FFP and 2U pRBC.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient complains of ongoing
headache. She also complains of palpitations which she says are
chronic. Review of systems was negative for nausea, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, vomitting, fevers, chills.

Portable CXR [**2168-12-29**]:
FINDINGS: No consolidation or edema is evident. Calcification is
seen at the ascending aorta. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged
but stable. No effusion or pneumothorax is noted. Degenerative
changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
.
CT Head w/o contrast [**2168-12-29**]:
FINDINGS: Study is limited by patient inability to lie flat and
large field of view used. There is significant underlying
hyperostosis totalis resulting in further degradation of image
quality. With this limitation in mind, there is no large
intracranial hemorrhage, large acute territorial infarction, or
large masses. Ventricles and sulci are stable in size and
configuration.  There is no shift of midline structures.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are within normal
limits. Diffuse hyperostosis is seen of the calvarium.

IMPRESSION: Limited study without gross evidence of acute
intracranial
process.
.
Abd Ultrasound [**2169-1-1**]:
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] evaluation of
the abdomen was performed. Evaluation of the liver is somewhat
limited due to patient's body habitus. However, there is no
intrahepatic biliary dilatation. No focal hepatic lesions are
identified. The gallbladder demonstrates sludge, but is
otherwise normal in appearance.

The right kidney measures 9.9 cm. The left kidney measures 12.8
cm. There is no hydronephrosis, stones or mass. The left kidney
demonstrates a cyst at the upper pole measuring up to 3 cm in
size.

The spleen measures up to 11.1 cm in size, which is unchanged
since the prior CT study of [**2165-9-30**]. The pancreas is not
well visualized due to overlying bowel gas.

IMPRESSION:
1. Spleen measuring 11.1 cm in size, within normal limits, and
unchanged
since the prior CT of [**2
