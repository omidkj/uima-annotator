Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
RUE pain and SOB x 1 day

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 33yo male with ESRD on HD since [**12/2152**], HTN and h/o
noncompliance who p/w RUE pain and SOB X1 day, the morning after
dialysis.  Pt was dialyzed the night before admission and then
awoke 6/24AM with SOB and pain in his right arm.  He describes
the RUE pain as sharp, localized to site of port-a-cath. Pt
admits to HTN medication non-compliance the night before
admission.  He denies associated chest pain/palpitations,
fever/chills/cough. He notes some abdominal pain and nausea
earlier in the day which had since resolved. No HA/dizziness. No
diarrhea/constipation. At baseline is able to climb steps w/o
SOB. Does not check his BP at home.

In the ED he had a set of cardiac enzymes that was lower than
his baseline and EKG unchanged from baseline. CTA was negative
for acute PE, but did reveal chronic segmental PE in RUL.  RUE
U/S showed a non-occlusive thrombus in the R IJ and a heparin
drip was started. Pt was noted to have BP of 205/144 in the ED
and was subsequently treated with a nitro drip.  CXR in the ED
showed pulmonary edema.

[**5-21**] CXR (Portable AP):
Pulmonary edema without evidence of focal infiltrate.

[**5-21**] U/S:
Findings suggestive of a nonocclusive thrombus within the right
internal jugular vein, immediately upstream from the expected
location of the hemodialysis catheter.

[**5-21**] CTA Chest:
1. Diffuse ground-glass opacities bilaterally, with intralobular
septal
thickening. These findings are similar to prior CT from [**2154-5-6**], with
marked improvement on subsequent radiograph of [**2154-5-7**].
Given these
time course of findings, as well as a history of end-stage renal
disease on
hemodialysis, these findings likely reflect pulmonary edema.

2. Previously noted chronic segmental pulmonary embolism in the
right upper
lobe is not fully assessed on this study due to respiratory
motion. No large
central or large segmental pulmonary embolism identified.

3. Large calcified right upper pole renal lesion, incompletely
evaluated, and
appears largely unchanged.

[**5-23**] Renal U/S:
Limited study with delayed systolic upstroke in the left
parenchymal arteries. Renal artery stenosis in the setting
cannot be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
In the MICU:
Pt continued his heparin gtt from the ED for his R IJ
tunneled-cath clot.  Blood pressure elevated to 205/144 and was
controlled with a labetalol gtt and a nitro gtt.  Pt presented
in pulmonary edema and was subsequently taken to HD the night of
admission - pt did not require additional intervention.  Pt
developed one episode of bloody emesis and was taken off of his
heparin gtt.  By the time of transfer the pt was weaned off of
his labetalol/nitro gtt and was down to 4L of O2 with adequate
sats.
.
On the general medicine floor:
.
Nonocclusive right IJ thrombus:
Pt was treated with heparin to coumadin bridge.  The plan was
discussed with Vascular and Renal and it was decided that the R
IJ tunneled-cath would be left in place.  The catheter was
accessed for HD throughout the pt's stay.  Transplant surgery
will evaluate the pt for placement of a fistula.  Pt has missed
last 5 appointments as an outpatient.  Social work was contact[**Name (NI) **]
and will help facilitate the outpatient appointment.  Scheduled
appointment with transplant surgery on [**6-6**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 816**].
The pt was treated with warfarin 5mg x 3 days, warfarin 7.5mg x
3 days and finally warfarin 10mg x 1 day to reach the target
INR.  On the day of discharge pt had been therapeutic on heparin
for 7 days, had an INR of 1.9 and was given lovenox 30mg x 1
dose before leaving.  This plan was discussed with renal and
they approved the use of lovenox in the setting of this pt's end
stage renal disease managed with dialysis.  Pt will follow with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in dialysis for coumadin management until he sees his
PCP (pt never had a regular PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] appointment) Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12101**] this Thursday for further management.
.
Bloody emesis:
The pt had only 1 episode in the MICU [**5-22**].  Heparin and
coumadin were briefly held and restarted once the pt's HCT was
stable.  Pt was placed on pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **] and had no further
issues on the floor.
.
Fluid overload:
Pt initially presented with a BNP >[**Numeric Identifier **] and with pulmonary
edema.  Once stabilized in the MICU pt was able to maintain
adequate O2 sats on the floor without supplemental O2 and
demonstrated no clinical evidence of pulmonary congestion.
.
Hypertension:
Pt was weaned off of nitro gtt and labetalol gtt in the MICU.
Pt typically with BP 160s/100s on the floor with elevation to
180-200/110-120 in the early AM.  Pt asymptomatic with these
episodes.  BP responded to hydralazine IV prn.  Pt was initially
treated with n
