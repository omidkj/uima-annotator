Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 104318**] is a 42 year old man with DM I, ESRD on HD, CAD, CHF
and HTN who presented with chest pain requiring ICU care for
hypertensive urgency, with blood pressures steadily better
controlled.
.
# Hypertension: As per previous notes, Mr. [**Known lastname 104319**] baseline SBP
is 150-170. The exacerbating factor for this episode is unclear,
but his blood pressures were better post hemodialysis and after
being on a nitroglycerin drip in the MICU. The patient did not
have any signs of end organ damage.
- In the hospital the patient received nifedipine 90mg PO daily,
Metoprolol XL 150 mg PO DAILY, Lisinopril 40 mg PO DAILY. We
added a second dose of toprol XL 150 mg at night so that he was
discharged on toprol 150 mg [**Hospital1 **].
- We did consider increasing his lisinopril dose, but at the
time of discharge, his blood pressure was in the 130s systolic.
- On the floor, the patient remained without headache or chest
pain.
- He was instructed to follow up with his primary care physician
within one week upon discharge.
.
# ESRD c/b hyperkalemia: Once he arrived on the floor, his
electrolytes were stable. He received hemodialysis and was able
to return to his usual schedule (Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday). The
Renal team did follow along with us during his hospitalization.
- The patient was continued on his home Calcium Acetate 667 mg
PO TID W/MEALS and  Calcium Carbonate 500 mg PO TID.
- The patient does have a left fistula, which was functioning
appropriately.
.
# Chest pain: Mr. [**Known lastname 104318**] did have chest pain in the setting of
HTN but remained free of chest pain on the floor.  He did
complain of headache with the nitroglycerin drip.  It was
determined that his ECG and clinical picture were not consistent
with ACS. He does have an elevated troponin T presumably
secondary to his poor renal function which was near his
baseline. His CKMB was not elevated. A recent pMIBI with
negative stress and imaging showing fixed inferior wall defect
and no reversible defects.
- We continued the patient's Lisinopril, Metoprolol, and ASA.
- We did consider statin as outpatient but most recent LDL 73 in
[**2121-9-16**].
.
# Vitreous hemorrhage - The patient was seen by ophthalmology
while in the MICU.  He was [**Year (4 digits) 1988**] for an appointment in their
triage clinic for the day of discharge, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified of this. The patient did complain of "wavy" vision out
of the left eye, consistent with his hemorrhage. Further
management of this will be per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and his team.
.
# HA: The patient's headache was likely secondary to the
nitroglycerin drip. His head CT was without abnormality and he
had a non-focal neurologic exam.
.
# DMI: The patient was given his home dose of NPH with HISS as
per his home schedule. The NPH dose was reduced from 14 U at
night to 12 U at night due to low blood sugars (in the 50s) in
the early morning for two mornings in a row.
.
# GI: The patient was continued on his home regimen of
hyoscyamine, glycopyrrolate (anticholinergic agents),
metoclopramide, dolasetron, clonazepam (anti-emetics) and
simethicone.
.
# Depression: As per records, Mr. [**Known lastname 104318**] has a history of prior
SA and psych hospitalizations. Throughout his hospitalization,
he was without HI/SI.  It is noted that the patient often has
undergoes hospitalization during times of increased social
stressors.  He is also more comfortable about discussing these
matters when spoken with in Spanish.
- He was continued on his home dose of citalopram 20mg daily.
.
# FEN: He tolerated a cardiac, diabetic, renal diet while
hospitalized.
.
# Prophylaxis: He received subcutaneous heparin and protonix.
.
# Code status: FULL
