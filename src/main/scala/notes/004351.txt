Allergies:
Naprosyn / Vicodin / Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
84F history of multiple strokes, associated seizure disorder,
presumed multi-infarct dementia and expressive aphasia who has
been on cipro/flagyl x 1 week for diverticulitis presented from
her NH after being found down. She was initially brought to [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital earlier in the day after being found slumped in a
chair at approximately 11am.  She was initially disoriented,
able to deny pain to EMS, however was then observed to have
seizure-like activity with tonic-clonic jerking with post-ictal
deceribrate posturing.
.
At [**Hospital **] hospital her VS were 187/90 97 10 97.6 99% 10L, She
underwent NCHCT which was unremarkable.  She was transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] per family request.
.
Per daughter, pt's seizure in [**2186-1-19**] presented with
aspects of partial complex seizure: she was found to be
disoriented and staring at the ceiling at her nursing home, and
was unarousable in ED and had observed rapid eye movement.
Neurologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] decreased Keppra in [**Month (only) 547**] from 1000mg
[**Hospital1 **] to 500mg [**Hospital1 **] as he thought that speech slurring/slowness may
be due to Keppra. She had a prolonged post-ictal phase, with
convalescence lasting 1 month.
.
At baseline, pt is AO x 3, is able to remember events from the
past few days,  independent of ADLs, lives in private apt in
nursing home for 24h supervision as she has difficulty with
executive function, remembering meals and medications and IADLs.
Ambulates independently with no residual motor impairments from
prior strokes, does have a mild expressive aphasia. She has a
history of "stress incontinence" and has worn a diaper on and
off. Recent family meeting with neurologist about bringing her
home affirmed that they did not feel comfortable leaving her
without 24-hour supervision.

Micro:
[**2186-8-6**]: BCx - one bottle grew GPC in clusters, likely
contamination
[**2186-8-7**]: MRSA negative
.
NCHCT [**2186-8-6**] (from OSH): IMPRESSION: No intracranial
hemorrhage. Unchanged right and left parietal encephalomalacia.
.
NCHCT [**2186-8-6**] ([**Hospital1 18**]): There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
The ventricles are stable in size and configuration.
Encephalomalacia of the right and left parietal lobes is
unchanged from at least one year prior. No fracture is
identified. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are well aerated.
.
[**2186-8-6**] CXR: New bibasilar opacities worrisome for aspiration or
pneumonia.
.
EKG:  NSR at 85. Normal axis and intervals.  possible <1mm STD
in V5-V6, aside from that, no change from prior.
.
EEG [**2186-8-7**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to runs of
mixed theta
delta activity in the left temporal region. There were no spikes
or
frank discharges. The above findings likely reflects a markedly
increased focal irritabilty. No electrographic seizures were
noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital1 18**] ED- VS: T100.4 P72 BP 150/76 R24 O2 94% NRB. She was noted
to be somnolent, but arousable to noxious stimuli and moving her
extremities spontaneously but not following commands. CXR was
concerning for aspiration and pt received CTX, azithro and
flagyl. Neurology felt pt had a seizure, possibly caused by
cipro vs infection, and keppra was increased. She was given ASA
for an elevated troponin in the absence of ECG changes. Pt was
transferred to MICU for hypoxia and mental status changes. Upon
improvement, pt was transferred to floor for further care.
.
# Seizure/Altered Mental Status: Patient was witnessed to have a
tonic clonic seizure episode with subsequent obtundation at OSH,
but had no seizures since her admission to [**Hospital1 18**]. Per neurology,
keppra was increased to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **]. EEG was unremarkable for
continued seizure activity but did suggest markedly increased
focal irritabilty in left temporal region. Her mental status
improved throughout her hospital stay (AOx3 at discharge), but
per family, she had not returned to her baseline cognition
before her discharge.
.
# Pneumonia: It was unclear whether PNA preceeded or followed
seizure and pt was initially for both aspiration and community
acquired pneumonia. Changed to CAP treatment with Azithro/CTX.
Patient remained afebrile with SaO2 of 95-97% RA on floor.
.
# Elevated tropnin: Likely due to demand ischemia or strain
pattern in setting of seizure. Troponin trended downwards
throughout hospitalization. Patient with normal CKs, no prior
h/o CAD, was ruled out for MI with serial enzymes. EKG unchanged
from prior. Pt was discharged on ASA 81 mg.
.
# Diverticulitis - dx on OSH CT 1 week ago, symptoms resolved
per daughter. Abd exam benign. Cipro was discontinued given
seizure and diverticulitis was treated with flagyl/CTX which pt
was receiving for PNA.
.
#Anticoagulation - Pt on coumadin for atrial fibrillation. Her
INR and her coumadin was adjusted accordingly. INR at discharge
was 1.9. Pt was instructed to take coumadin 4mg PO on night of
discharge and with INR monitoring at rehab with goal 2.0-3.0.
