HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 105134**] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
woman with a significant history of coronary artery disease,
status post myocardial infarction times three, congestive
heart failure (last echo with an ejection fraction of 40%)
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a rapid response,
presented with chest pain and a rapid rate, and respiratory
decompensation.  She was emergently intubated, had admitted
from the emergency department to [**Hospital1 190**] CCU.

The patient was noted to have ST elevations with her rapid
rate which cleared when her rate was adequately controlled
with beta-blockers.  However, later that evening she
developed sinus bradycardia.  This is a known response in the
patient to administration of beta-blockers.

In the CCU she was diuresed with resolution of respiratory
distress, CKMB fraction was positive but Troponin I was
negative.  She was initially started on Heparin but this was
stopped due to the feeling that she was likely not suffering
infarction.

She was called out to the floor in stable condition.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives in [**Hospital3 **].  Primary care
physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 97.8, blood
pressure 123/77, heart rate in the 60 sating at 98% on 40%
FIO2 with a PEEP of 5.  Nasally intubated.  Awake, alert,
mouthing words appropriately.  Mucosa dry.  Heart rate rhythm
regular, no murmurs.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally
and superiorly.  Scattered expiratory wheezes.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Rectal exam:  Heme negative.
Extremities had 1+ edema.  She was alert and oriented times
three and her neurological exam was grossly nonfocal.

LABORATORY:  On admission initial white count 202, hematocrit
38.1, platelets 351, sodium 141, potassium 5.0, chloride 104,
bicarbonate 24, BUN 52, creatinine 1.5.  Glucose 242.  CK 66,
troponin I less then 0.3.  Calcium 9.4, magnesium 2.3,
phosphorus 4.7.

Urinalysis with 30 protein, 3 to 5 red blood cells, 0 to 2
white blood cells.  Arterial blood gases:  7.27/54/281 on 40%
O2, PEEP of 5, Tidal volumes of 500.

Chest x-ray showing congestive heart failure without
infiltrates.

Electrocardiogram:
1.  Atrial flutter at 104, no Q-waves 2, [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations
in V1 through V3.  ST depressions V4 through V6, 1 and L.
2.  Atrial flutter at 57.  ST changes noted above had
resolved.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 105134**] was initially
intubated, admitted to the CCU as detailed in above note.
Although her resuscitation status was DNR/DNI this was not
noted at this time and she was inadvertently intubated.
While in the CCU she was rapidly extubated.

There was an initial concern for cardiac ischemia with the
elevated CKMB fraction in the absence of Troponin I
elevation.  This was thought to be consistent with an enzyme
leak secondary to strain.  She was seen by covering
physicians for her primary care cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1104**] and
decision was made not to pursue further interventions or
workup at this time.  Initially her rate which was very rapid
and probably precipitated her decompensation was controlled
with beta-blockers.  However, she did not tolerate this well
although it initially decreased her rate allowing for
control.  She then became bradycardiac.  Upon further review
the patient had apparently done this in the past.  However,
through the rest of her admission her rate remained well
controlled without the use of beta-blockers.

Congestive heart failure that she initially suffered
secondary to her rapid rate was thought to be from flash
pulmonary edema, responded well to diuresis at the time of
this dictation she is sating well on room air and able to
ambulate comfortably without desaturation.

Her chronic renal insufficiency was stable with a creatinine
of 1.5 which was close to her baseline.  This did not change
even with aggressive diuresis following her pulmonary edema.

She was continued on her asthma medications while in house
using our formulary substitutions, Montolucast,
Betamethasone, Albuterol MDI.  She had no asthma
exacerbations while in house.

Her initial white count was elevated over 200 however, this
subsequently declined to less than 100 with no interventions.
It was thought this initial laboratory was actually spurious
and that her white count was below 100 which is near her
baseline.  At the time of discharge her last white count was
97.  No further workup or intervention was taken at this time
and she can follow-up as an outpatient with her own
hematologist.

A physical therapy consult was requested to evaluate her for
home safety.  Their recommendations were that she could
return home but would require home physical therapy to
increase her functional mobility balance and endurance.  Our
caseworkers will assist in arranging this.

The patient does have baseline anemia and given her enzyme
leak she was transfused with one unit of packed red blood
cells for a hematocrit of 28.7.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
2.  Flash pulmonary edema.
3.  CLL.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
6.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
7.  Hypothyroidism.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To home, [**Hospital3 **].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  As upon admission with the addition
of Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q day.

Follow-up:  The patient should follow-up with primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within the next one to two weeks.
