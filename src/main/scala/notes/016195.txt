Brief Hospital Course:
She was cleared for surgery by dental. EGD done for anemia
showed no bleeding and three biopsies were done which have since
returned negative. She was taken to the operating room on [**2203-6-13**]
where she underwent a MVR, please see operative note for
details. She was transferred to the ICU in critical but stable
condition on epinephrine and propofol. She required significant
volume resuscitation. She was started on milrinone. She had
several episodes of hypertension with flash pulmonary edema, and
She was started on a lasix drip. She was started on a heparin
drip for her mechanical valve. She was started on anxiolytics
for agitation with attempts at vent weaning. TEE was negative
for perivalvular leak or other major pathology.  Her milrinone
was weaned to off. Vanco was started empirically for GPC and GPR
in sputum. She remained intubated and not following commands.
Dobhoff tube was placed in IR on [**6-23**] and she was started on
tube feeds once the tube was post pyloric. Head CT done for
mental status showed no acute processes. Her white count rose
and she was started on flagyl and cipro along with vanco and she
was pancultured (remain negative). She awaited improved mental
status prior to extubation on [**6-27**]. She was started on coumadin
for her mechanical valve. Bedside swallow evaluation recommended
advancing diet to honey thick liquids and pureed solids. PICC
line was placed on [**6-29**]. She remained in the ICU for aggressive
pulmonary toilet. Her creatinine increased and her diuretic was
held, and she was given free water for hypernatremia. She was
seen by electrophysiology for persistent atrial fibrillation and
her medications were adjusted.
She was seen by ENT for continued hoarseness several days after
extubation. Exam showed mild vocal cord findings but no evidence
of nerve injury, and she was started on [**Hospital1 **] PPI. She was
transferred to the floor on POD #22. She has remained
hemodynamically stable, and is now ready to be transrferred to a
rehab facility.
