Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath for two days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thrombolysis


History of Present Illness:
38 y/o male with a h/o diverticulosis developed sudden onset of
dyspnea on [**7-10**], a few days after falling (injuring both knees
and developing pain in his right calf).  The dyspnea worsened
over the next day, and on [**7-12**] he developed tachycardia and felt
like his heart was pounding.  In an OSH [**Name (NI) **], pt worked up for MI,
found to have sinus tach with TWI in II, avF, and V1-V5.  He was
started on ASA, heparin, and lopressor and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**], where a CTA showed massive bilateral PE -- sbp in 80's,
came up to 110's with hydration.  He denied any h/o recent
immobility, travel, or previous clots.  The pt was transferred
to MICU and underwent thrombolysis.  Pt had large RV mural
thrombus, not seen on follow-up echo.  LE dopplers positive for
DVT in bilateral popliteal veins.


Past Medical History:

Social History:
Pt works as a sign painter, lives with parents, has moderate

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, where an ECG showed
T-wave inversion in II, III, AVF, and V1-5 with Q's in II, III,
and AVF, troponins demonstrated no evidence of MI (though
slightly elevated to 0.07), and a CTA showed massive bilateral
PE's.  He was hypotensive with sbp in 80's but came up to 110
with NS bolus.  The pt was transferred to the MICU where he got
an ECHO and bilateral LENIs showing RV and bilateral popliteal
thrombus.  Given the severity of PE's and the multiple thrombi,
the pt underwent thrombolysis with no complications.  A repeat
echo showed that the RV thrombus had also been cleared.  The
patient remained hemodynamically improved in the ICU, with no
SOB, sbp in the 110-120 range without fluid support, and heart
rate in the low 60's.  He was felt to be ready for call-out to
the floor.  There he remained asymptomatic without recurrence of
sx, maintained on IV heparin and started on po warfarin.  The
patients PTT goal was difficult to achieve and required higher
than usual doses, thought to be secondary to high clot burden.

At discharge, the pt remained sub-therapeutic on warfarin, but
with a plan to go to [**Hospital3 7569**] for every other day
phlebotomies, to be sent and followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **].  In the
interim, he will be covered with enoxaparin, for which the
nursing staff trained him in its administration.  Plan to follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks, then once MassHealth becomes
active, he will follow up with a PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) **], possibly Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 58017**], a pulmonologist, who has been contact[**Name (NI) **] about his
hosptial course and th need to follow up on a cavitary pulmonary
nodule, which was felt to be approriate for outpatient work-up,
repeat CT in three months.  In [**1-12**] months, he will also have an
appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for a thrombophilia
work-up.
