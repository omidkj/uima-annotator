Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2169-3-17**] Urgent Aortic Valve Replacement(23mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Porcine

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77595**] is a 81 year old male who presented to outside
hospital with worsening exertional chest pain. He also admitted
to recent history of leg swelling, dyspnea on exertion and
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. BNP was over 1600 and troponins
were slightly elevated. He has known aortic stenosis. A recent
ECHO from [**2168-8-20**] showed [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.8cm2 with EF of 50% and
trace mitral regurgitation. He subsequently underwent cardiac
catheterization which confirmed severe aortic stenosis.
Angiography revealed an occluded right dominant right coronary
artery with only mild disease in the left coronary system. Based
upon the results, he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
surgical intervention.

[**2169-3-17**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with inferior and lateral amid to apical hypokinesi. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
(LVEF= 30 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (mobile)
atheroma in the descending aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Due to
co-existing aortic regurgitation, the pressure half-time
estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of true
mitral valve area. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including Norepinephrine,
Epinephrine and Milrinone and is being AV paced.
1. A mitral bioprosthesis is well seated, no MR is seen.
Leaflets open well.
2. An Aortic Bioprosthesis is well seated. No AI is seen.
Leaflets open well.
3. LV function is improved. RV function maybe slightly
depressed, but views are suboptimal.
4. Aorta is intact post decannulation.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2169-3-23**] 2:48 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old man s/p CABG/AVR/MVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval pleural effusions
HISTORY: Status post cardiac surgery, to evaluate for change.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-19**], the Swan-Ganz
catheter has been removed. Bibasilar atelectasis and effusions
are again seen, as well as pleural calcifications. Intact
sternal sutures are again noted.

IMPRESSION: Little change except for removal of the Swan-Ganz
catheter.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77595**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and
underwent routine preoperative evaluation. Given he started to
experience rest pain associated with near syncope and long
pauses on electrocardiogram, it was decided to urgently take him
to the operating room where Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed aortic and
mitral valve replacements along with coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery. For additional surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation, he
was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. On arrival,
several units of PRBCs were given for postoperative anemia.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. He initially required complete AV
pacing for underlying complete heart block. All nodal agents
were withheld and the EP service was consulted for pacemaker
evaluation. Over several days, his rhythm was observed. His
complete heart block gradually resolved but he did develop
intermittent atrial fibrillation. Low dose beta blockade was
eventually initiated. He otherwise maintained stable
hemodynamics and eventually transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day five. He was started on coumadin for a fib. He
awaited rehab placement. He was ready for discharge to rehab on
POD #10.
