Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
presented for upgrade to biventricular pacer, transferred to CCU
for management of cardiogenic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Catherization for upgrade of biventricular pacer

History of Present Illness:
85 yo M with hx of AF & CHB s/p PPM ([**4-/2148**]), generator change
([**2-7**]), CAD s/p CABG ([**2139**]) & multiple coronary/renal/peripheral
stents, ischemic CM (EF 35%) who presented for resynchronization
with upgrade to biventricular pacer given recently worsened EF
and CHF symptoms. During the procedure he underwent balloon
venoplasty of his obstructed SVC, and became increasingly
agitated requiring more sedation. He was intubated, became
hypotensive with BPs droppng to systolic 60s, and started on
multiple pressors. Emergent echo showed no tamponade, but
decreased cardiac function likely cardiogenic shock. Per report,
he went into PEA and received CPR X 8 minutes, 1 of atropine, 2
of epi, and regained spontaneous circulation. Given he had
instrumentation of both the SVC and pulmonary artery, with
hemoptysis during intubation, there was concern for hypovolemia
secondary to blood loss (? into mediastinum versus pulmonary
hemorrhage). Hct was checked and 25 (5 pt drop). He received two
units PRBC. He received 1g Vanc in setting of getting multiple
urgent lines. CXR was negative for PTX. He was placed on a
ballon pump with subsequent improvement in his pressures (MAP
70s-80s) and transferred to the CCU on Levophed and Epinephrine.

.
In the CCU he was given 80 of IV lasix and started on a lasix
gtt. Hct's were checked q2hrs, and because they were stable he
was started on a heparin gtt (given the balloon pump). He was
hypothermic and had a lactate of 10. His ABGs were monitored and
vent settings optimized. He was weaned off epinephrine. Family
was updated.
.
Unable to obtain ROS [**1-3**] clinical status- intubated and
non-responsive.

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**2159-1-10**]
Poor image quality. The left atrium is elongated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %). There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right
atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion.
.
EEG [**2159-1-10**]
IMPRESSION: This long-term EEG showed an encephalopathic
background throughout. The background was slow and of low
voltage. There were no prominent focal abnormalities. There were
no epileptiform features.
.
EEG [**2159-1-11**]
IMPRESSION: This long-term EEG showed an encephalopathic
background throughout. The background was slow and of low
voltage. There were no prominent focal abnormalities. There were
no epileptiform features.
.
EEG [**2159-1-12**]
This EEG telemetry with video showed a low voltage mildly slow
background throughout, without any evidence of seizures or
epileptiform discharges. The low voltage very regular background
indicates a widespread encephalopathy. Some of the more rhythmic
features raise the possibility of medication effect. There were
no focal abnormalities or epileptiform features.
.
EEG [**2159-1-21**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry showed a markedly encephalopathic
background throughout. There were no clearly epileptiform
features or electrographic seizures. There was frequent movement
artifact, and some of this appeared to be large amplitude
movements, possibly as part of an abnormal respiratory pattern.
Also, there were some sudden jerks of the head to the left,
possibly myoclonic, but without associated epileptiform features
on the EEG, and at a frequency of under one every three seconds.
There were no clear seizures.
.
EEG [**2159-1-22**]
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. The
background was slow throughout, with additional bursts of
generalized slowing. These findings indicate a widespread
encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical
structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection
are among the most common causes. There were no areas of
prominent focal slowing. There were no clearly epileptiform
features, and there were no electrographic seizures.
.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2159-1-12**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process on CT.
2. Extensive subcortical white matter hypodensities; could be
related to
chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2159-1-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Increased mucosal thickening within the sphenoid sinus could
represent an ongoing inflammatory process.
.
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND [**2159-1-16**]
1. Cholelithiasis, without specific son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of
acute cholecystitis. No biliary ductal dilation.
2. Extensive aortic atherosclerotic disease, with linear
echogenic focus within the mid abdominal aorta possibly
representing a dissection flap of indeterminate chronicity.
3. Bilateral renal cysts.
4. Right pleural effusion.
.
ABDOMINAL XRAY [**2159-1-16**]
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of obstruction
.
CXR [**2159-1-16**] Persistent bilateral pneumonia, or
resuscitation-related lung contusion. Worsening pulmonary edema.

.
LOWER EXTREMITY NON INVASIVE ULTRAOUND
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in both lower extremities.
.

UPPER EXTREMITY
IMPRESSION: Cephalic vein thrombosis. The deep veins of the
right upper extremity are patent.
.
CXR [**2159-1-9**] The patient is intubated, the tip of the
endotracheal tube projects approximately 2 cm above the carina.
Right pectoral pacemaker, no evidence of pneumothorax. Correctly
positions.
.
CXR [**2159-1-23**]
Endotracheal tube is in standard placement. Clear definition of
the upper aspect of the cuff indicates pooled secretions above.
Heart size is top normal, decreased since [**1-21**]. Pulmonary
vascular engorgement has also improved, indicating improved
cardiac function. Left lung is clear. Right lung base is
partially obscured by pleural effusion, but also appears to have
cleared of pneumonia or asymmetric edema. Small right pleural
effusion persists. There is no pneumothorax. Transvenous right
atrial, right ventricular, and left ventricular pacer leads are
in standard placements unchanged. Left PIC line tip is partially
obscured by pacer leads, but is probably in the mid SVC.
