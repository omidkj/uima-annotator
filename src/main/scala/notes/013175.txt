posterior descending artery)


History of Present Illness:
66 y.o. male with history of hypertension, not on medication, no
other risk factors, and generally is averse to medical care,
presents for evaluation of chest discomfort at rest.  Patient
first noticed intermittent exertional chest discomfort 1 week
PTA, walking 6-7 minutes after dinner with [**2196-3-10**] substernal
chest tightness, non-radiating, not associated with any
shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or nausea, and resolved with
rest after 2 minutes.  He subsequently had 3-4 episodes after
similar amount of activity.  On the day of admission, patient
had the chest discomfort at rest while sitting down after lunch,
[**2196-6-13**], this time with diaphoresis.  He initially got in his car
and drove to pick up some aspirin, which he took.  He then
called his daughter who saw him and said he "looked paled,"
which prompted him to call his PCP and be sent to the ED.

The patient's symptoms were essentially continuous for a period
of about 1 hour until he arrived in the ED, although somewhat
improved after taking the aspirin.  He was found to have SBP 197
in ED and received ASA, metoprolol 5mg IV x 1, followed by NTG
SL x 3, and then noticed decline of his symptoms and eventual
resolution.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] 6 cardiology service with
an NSTEMI.  He had lateral precordial lead ST segment
depressions and a peak CK of 360 and troponin of 1.08. He was
initally hesitant to undergo cardiac catherization, but after
explanation of the risks and benefits with the patient and his
family, he agreed and was taken to the Catherization lab.
Catherization showed severe 3VD, a total occlusion of the Lcx
and 70% LM disease. He was continued on integrellin and heparin.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and his integrellin was d/c'd
@1:00am on the day prior to surgery.  On [**8-16**] he was transported
to the operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.  Please see operative report for further details.  He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on op day he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. On post-op day his chest tubes were removed.  He
remained in the CSRU for respiratory management, he was genly
diuresised.  On post op day three his pacing wires were removed
and he was transferred to the telemetry floor. Physical followed
patient during entire post-op course for strength and mobility.
He continued to make steady process without any post-op
complications and was discharged home with VNA services on
post-op day 5.
