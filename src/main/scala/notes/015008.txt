PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 45 %).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
borderline normal free wall function.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve
stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) central mitral
regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**Known lastname 65020**] at
8AM.
.
POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including epinephrine 0.02
mcg/kg/min.

Borderline global hypokinesis of RV and LV. LVEF 45 to 50%.
There is a mitral annular prosthesis in the mitral annular
region c/w with ring, stable, with no residual regurgitation or
stenosis.
Thoracic aortic contour is intact.
Moderate TR..

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2128-6-28**] 9:05 AM

Reason: evaluate effusions
Final Report
INDICATION: Status post mitral valve replacement, to evaluate
for effusions.
COMPARISON: [**2128-6-26**].
CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Right internal jugular line is again seen with
tip
projecting in the body of the right atrium. Cardiomediastinal
contours are
stable. Bibasilar atelectasis is slightly progressed on this
study and
bilateral pleural effusions are slightly larger. Median
sternotomy wires are again seen. Osseous structures are grossly
normal.
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight worsening of bibasilar atelectasis and persistent
small bilateral effusions.
2. Central venous catheter with tip projecting in the body of
the right
atrium.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 65020**] was admitted on [**6-21**] for IV heparin and completion of
her pre-operative workup. She underwent a mitral valve repair
with 28mm [**Company 1543**] 3D ring with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**6-22**]. She
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in
critical but stable condition on titrated epinephrine and
propofol drips. She was extubated and weaned from her pressors
by post-operative day two.  Her chest tubes were removed and she
was transferred to the surgical step-down floor.  Her epicardial
wires were removed, her medications were titrated and she was
started on coumadin for atrial fibrillation.  She was
aggressively diuresed. She made slow progress in physical
activity capacity and on post-operative day six she was ready
for discharge to rehabilitation at Willow Manor in [**Hospital1 189**].
