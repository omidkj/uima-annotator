Percocet / Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath

History of Present Illness:
59 yo male with history of hypercholesterolemia presented to
[**Hospital3 **] night prior to admission with acute SSCP
withEKG changes s/p transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath.  Pt
reports he experienced progressive decrease in exercise
tolerance and on Friday, developed acute SSCP with radiation to
L ear without SOB/nausea/vomiting/diaphoresis.  He reports that
his pain never fully resolved and given continued symptoms,
presented to [**Hospital3 2783**] last night.  At OSH, pt had
persistent pain and was given ASA, nitro, heparin, EKG with
junctional escape rhythm with ST depression in V2-V6 and Q-waves
in II, II, aVF and negative Right sided EKG.  Toponin I 117.  Pt
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath.  Cath
showed totally occluded RCA full of thrombus and plaque s/p
export catheter, angiojet, PTCA, s/p Cypher stents x3 with 5%
residual stenosis, 80% LCx, 60% mid LAD, 40% LMCA.  Pt was
hemodynamically stable and subsequently transferred to CCU.
Upon arrival, pt complained of mild chest "ache"/pressure.  EKG
with slightly more prominent ST depressionin V4 so nitro gtt and
heparin gtt were started.

Past Medical History:
Hypercholesterolmia

Social History:
Pt is married, and has 2 children, [**Male First Name (un) **] of [**University/College **] college.  Pt
denies smoking, + EtOH, and denies IV drug use.

Family History:
No CAD in the family

Physical Exam:

GEN: Resting comfortably in NAD
HEENT: NC/AC, PERRL, EOMI, MMM, neck supple, no JVD.

Pertinent Results:
EKG:junctional rhythm @ 64 BPM, nl axis, Q-waves in II, III,
aVF.  ST depression in V2-V6.

Cath: ([**1-5**]): total occlusion of proximal RCA with abundant
thrombus, removed extensive amt of clot and RCA stent x 3 w/
Cypher DES, 80%LCx, 60% mid-LAD, 40% LMCA. HD notable for
overload/RV infarct physiology

Cath ([**1-6**]): The RCA had widely patent stents.  A small LCX had
a 90% stenosis in the mid vessel.  Successful PTCA of the LCX
lesion with a 2.0 mm balloon. Final angiography showed a 20%
residual stenosis, a small dissection and normal flow

Echo: EF 55% The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild focal
hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall. The remaining segments
contract well and overall systolic function is preserved. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.


Brief Hospital Course:
1)CAD: Pt presented with acute inferior MI with q-wave on
inferior leads on EKG with lateral ST depression most likely
representing his LCx disease.  Pt underwent cath on [**1-5**]
showing totally occluded RCA s/p export catheter/angio jet and
successful placement of Cypher stents x3 to RCA with 5% residual
stenosis.  Cath also showed 60% mid LAD and 80% LCx.  Pt was
scheduled to have a 2nd cath for intervention on his LCx.  Upon
arrival to the floor, pt continued to have [**4-3**] CP with EKG
showing slightly more prominent ST depression in V4-V5.  Pt was
on integrillin drip which were to be continued until the 2nd
cath.  Heparin gtt and nitro gtt were also started.  Multiple
EKGs done showed stable ST depression in the lateral leads and
cardiac enzymes were trending down, peak CK = 1102.  Beta
blocker was held for persistent junctional rhythm at 60-70 BPM.
Pt was continued on ASA, Plavix, Lipitor.  Pt was taken back to
the cath lab the next day with successful PTCA to the mid LCx.
Pt no longer had chest pain after the 2nd cath.  Pt needs ETT in
[**3-28**] weeks.  Pt needs a cardiologist for a follow up.  Pt was
offered to be set up with [**Hospital1 **] cardiologist, but the patient
insisted on discussing it with his wife and his PCP before
choosing his cardiologist.  He was told the importance of his
PCP setting up an appointment with a cardiologist.

2)Rhythm: Pt was in accelerated junctional rhythm of 60-70 BPM
on arrival most likely secondary to vagal tone from inferior MI.
 Pt remained in accelarated junctional rhythm but occasionally
showing underlying p-wave/sinus beat when junctional rhythm
brady'd to 30's at night.  He regained his normal sinus rhythm
on [**1-8**], and was able to tolerate metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].  He
was discharged with [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts and was told to frequently
push the button since he will most likely by asymptomatic if he
goes back to junctional rhythm.

3)Pump: TTE post cath showed EF 55% with normal valves.  Pt
appeared slightly fluid overloaded on exam with O2sat in low
90's after post-cath hydration.  Pt may have had small CHF
during inferior MI with stunned myocardium and no atrial
contraction from junctional rhythm.  He was diuresed with small
dose of IV Lasix (10-20 mg) with clinical improvement.  He is
recommended for follow up echo in [**4-30**] weeks.

4)Pulm: Pt states he and his wife felt lousy prior to admission.
 After cath, pt continued to have low grade temp of 100, cough,
crackles/bronchial breath sound at the right base, and CXR
suggestive of consolidation/pneumonia.  Pt was discharged with 7
day of course of levofloxacin.
