History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 yo man w/ HTN, CVA, COPD, hyponatremia, EtOH abuse,
and SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right inferior
thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p tracheostomy
and PEG [**3-/2177**], recently discharged to rehab from MICU [**Location (un) **],
who was admitted to the floor on [**4-29**] for right LE DVT. His right
leg has become more warm and edematous, with mild pain, compared
to the left x3 days, and LENIs showed a right partially occluded
distal femoral and popliteal DVT. Given his recent bleed,
anticoagulation was not started, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for consideration of an IVC filter. Also completing course of
antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia from prior
admission.

While on the floor early morning of [**4-30**] he started coughing and
was noted to have bleeding from his trache. He did not have any
respiratory difficulties, and ~150cc of blood was suctioned out
through the trach, the cuff was inflated for airway protection
and he was transfered to MICU green for monitoring. ENT saw the
patient, who was known to them, suspected  bleeding from  mass
on direct visualization. Pt was being taken down to IR for IVC
filter when he began to bleed again from his trach site.  At
that time he was placed on the ventilator, paralyzed and
sedated. ENT packed his oral cavity.  Pt then transported to IR
for IVC filter placement. Given that his bleeding has been
attributed to his mass, he is being transfered to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU for ongoing care while he initiates XRT to his mass.
Hematocrit was stable and he was HD stable, so he is being
transferred to the ICU for closer airway monitoring.

Denies CP, SOB, palpitations, change in chronic productive
cough. No other bleeding. Denies fever, chills, dysuria.
Currently pain free.

Imaging Studies:
[**4-30**] Procedure:
IMPRESSION: Prominent bilateral superior thyroidal arteries and
left inferior thyroidal artery supplying hypervascular
oropharyngeal mucosa.
Successful embolization of blood supply to hypervascular tumor
via the
bilateral superior thyroidal arteries and left inferior
thyroidal artery.

[**5-5**] CT head:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process; specifically no evidence for
enhancing
masses. MR is more sensitive for the detection of small masses.
2. Bilateral maxillary sinus mucosal disease.
.
[**5-5**] CT neck:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive hypopharyngeal mass appearing similar to prior with
evaluation of supraglottic extension difficult.
2. No obvious lymphadenopathy.
3. Persistent left vertebral artery nonvisualization and plaque
in the left carotid bifurcation.
.
[**5-5**] CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. New multifocal ground-glass opacity and consolidation in left
lung, mostly in the peribronchial and peripheral distribution,
with one wedge shaped peripheral opacity. Findings are
nonspecific but could be due to infection such as angioinvasive
fungus (for example, mucormycosis);
hemorrhage; or, alternatively, with history of DVT, this could
reflect infarct from non- visualized pulmonary embolism.
2. Thickening and calcification of the anterolateral wall of the
trachea and both mainstem bronchi, could be idiopathic or
related to relapsing
polychondritis. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening, slightly more
prominent on the left associated with left lower lobe mucoid
impaction could be related to infection or inflammation.
3. Minimal emphysema.
4. Moderate left and small right pleural effusion. Small
pericardial
effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis.
5. Enlargement of main pulmonary artery, suggesting possible
pulmonary
hypertension.
6. Severe calcifications of the left main coronary artery.
7. Secretions in the carina and both mainstem bronchi, which
could be blood in setting of tracheal bleed.
8. Please see separately dictated neck CT.




Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 67 year old man with history of HTN, CVA, COPD,
status post recent diagnosis of SCC of larynx status post coil
embolization of right inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal
bleed [**3-/2177**], status post trach and PEG [**3-/2177**], recently
discharged to rehab approximately 1 month ago, who initially
presented and was admitted to the floor on [**4-29**] for right LE DVT,
with subsequent complicated hospital course for bleeding at
tracheostomy site.

# Bleeding from tracheostomy site:  24 hours after admission to
floor, patient was noted to have coughing and bleeding from his
tracheostomy site.  This was initially managed by inflating the
cuff for airway protection, as well as transfer to the MICU
(initially to [**Hospital Ward Name **] MICU) for closer monitering.  He also
received 2 units of packed RBC.
ICU course:  Despite the cuff inflation, the patient had
intermittent bleeding from his tracheostomy site, requiring
placement on the ventilator.  ENT was involved, and site was
packed (where patient was transiently on prophylactic
clindamycin).  He went to IR for IVC filter placement to address
his DVT, at which time he also underwent coiling of a thyroid
artery.
Oncology was also involved during his hospital course, and he
was ultimately transferred from the [**Hospital Ward Name **] MICU to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initiation of emergent radiation to be able to
stop the bleeding. He therefore underwent salvage radiation with
control of the bleeding, and was successfully weaned off the
ventilator, and currently remains stable on trach mask.
FLOOR COURSE:  After stabilization in the ICU, patient was
transferred back to regular medical floor where bleeding
remained stable.  Cancer was addressed as below.

# Right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis: Patient was
admitted to the floor on [**4-29**] for right lower extremity DVT. His
initial complaints were right leg pain, warmth, edema x 3 days,
with lower extremity ultrasound (performed at rehab)
demonstrating a right partially occluded distal femoral and
popliteal DVT.  He was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] with above for
cons
