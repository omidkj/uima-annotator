History of Present Illness:
54 yo man with AML s/p allo-SCT (MRD) now day 370 c/b GVH of
liver and skin, disseminated TB, CMV viremia, hematuria and most
recently admitted for tamponade secondary to large pericardial
effusion accumulation, s/p pericardial drain now with chest tube
POD #4.

In brief originally, he has a history of AML diagnosed in [**2169**],
S/p induction and consolidation with Ara-C. During induction he
developed neutropenic fever and was diagnosed with widely
disseminated  tuberculosis with splenic, pancreatic, and
pulmonary lesions as well as bilateral pleural effusions and
pericardial effusion. Cultures from blood, pleural fluid, lymph
node biopsy as well as sputums to the time of his discharge all
ultimately grew MTB from culture despite have negative AFB
smear. At that time he was started on four drug therapy and long
steroid taper. His pyrazinamide was discontinue on month 5,
however shortly thereafter he was diagnosed with a tuberculous
paraspinal abscess at the level of the right kidney in [**2-16**] that
required drainage. Levofloxacin was added to his regimen at that
time. In [**3-19**] his ethambutol was discontinued secondary to optic
neuritis. He has since had drainage of pulmonary tuberculomas
and pleural effusion at [**Hospital1 336**]. At the time of his allo BMT it was
decided that INH, rifampin and levofloxacin would be continued
for 12 months.

Approximately 9 months after transplant on [**2171-10-9**] his
medications were discontinued for elevated LFTs. Prior liver
biopsy was consistent with GVHD, and his LFTs continued to be
elevated since discontinuation of his TB meds. He was received
pentostatin, rituxan and photopheresis for his GVHD which has
affected his mouth, eyes, gut, skin, +/- bladder.

The patient was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 63310**] for symptoms of
volume overload. He was found to have a large pericardial
effusion with tamponade physiology. He [**Date range (1) 1834**] pericardial
drain for 1300 cc of serosanguinous fluid. Glucose level was
normal, gram stain, AFB smear and culture, TB PCR and adenovirus
PCR were negative. His drain was pulled. The etiology of his
effusion was undetermined, however viral infection vs TB vs GVHD
vs medication effect (tacrolimus?) were considered. During this
admission he also had a chest CT which revealed bilaterally
upper lobe infiltrates with nodules and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance.
Sputums were negative for AFB smear but poor sampling precluded
concentrated smear. The patient refused bronchoscopy at that
time, and the plan upon discharge was repeat CT scan in one
week.
He was not started on TB meds. Incidentally he was diagnosed
with
VRE and morganella UTIs and completed a course of daptomycin and
cefpodoxime.

Beta D glucan checked on day prior to discharge was resulted to
170. He was seen in the [**Hospital **] clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who ordered a
repeat level which remained elevated to 152. She started him on
treatment doses of Atovaquone for concern of smoldering PCP
given worsening chest xray findings. Azithromycin was also
started for atypical pathogens. Sputum cultures were negative
for PCP on DFA (although these were poor samples), however
bacterial cultures were positive for Stenotrophomonas. He was
started on Bactrim on [**1-3**], Atovaquone was discontinued.

Per the patient's wife, he was at baseline in regards to
shortness of breath and had not been able to lay flat since
discharge. His cough has been improving in the past few days.
Yesterday he complained of fatigue and back pain, and at 3AM
this morning he developed chest pain radiating to his left arm.
911 was called and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 19345**]. CTA was performed which did not reveal PE; however a
large pericardial effusion and bilateral effusions as well as
mild ascites and cystic mass in pancreatic head. TTE at the OSH
was reportedly negative for tamponade, although the patient did
have one episode of hypotension with SBP to the 70s which
responded to a 500 cc bolus. His platelet count was noted to be
17. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where he was tachycardic
to 110, hypotensive to 80-90s systolic. Bedside TTE at our
institution revealed tamponade physiology with collapsing RV. He
was taken emergently to the OR where a minithoracotomy was and
pericardial window was performed. Per verbal report
approximately 400 cc of dark blood was drained. A left sided
chest tube was placed. He was transferred to the CT ICU where he
remains intubated. He received Cefazolin perioperatively and 4
units of platelets.

ROS per wife was negative for fever, chills, sick contacts, URI
symptoms.


Past Medical History:
ONC HISTORY (per OMR):
1. Diagnosed in early [**8-/2169**] with nightly fevers. BM bx
revealed AML. Flow cytometry showed aberrant expression of CD2,
CD7, HLA-DR, CD 34, dim CD33, CD 117, and CD 71. CT scan
revealednecrotic lymph nodes in the superior mediastinum and
periportalregion, and multiple low attenuation lesions in the
liver and spleen concerning for microabscesses from a
disseminated infection.
2. [**2169-8-17**]: Induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and
idarubicin complicated by persistent fevers and extensive workup
ultimately revealing disseminated tuberculosis infection. His
course was also complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation and
hypotension and the development of a severe cardiomyopathy.
3. S/P one dose of high-dose ARA-C at 1.5 mg per meter squared,
lowered dose due to his disseminated tuberculosis, and then he
received a second course of HiDAC at 3 gram per meter squared
dose and developed acute onset of gait instability. No further
chemotherapy given.
4. Relapsed in 7/[**2170**]. [**Year (4 digits) **] re-induction with ME on [**2170-8-13**].
Noted for pulmonary nodules which were suspicious for
aspergillus and empirically treated with Voriconazole with
improvement noted on CT.
5. Admitted on [**2170-10-25**] for maintenance therapy while awaiting
BMT. However, upon admit he was again found to have blasts. He
proceeded with Idarubicin and Cytarabine(7+2) butdid not achieve
a remission.
6. S/P High dose Ara-c with remission.
7. [**Year (4 digits) **] sibling related allo transplant on [**2171-1-8**]. Allo
course c/b increased LFTs of unclear etiology, possibly from
chemotherapy, renal failure attributed to CSA, and received only
1 dose of MTX due to mucositis.
8. Post transplant course complicated by asymptomatic CMV
viremia and
viral/URI syndromes.
9. In [**2171-5-12**] developed diarrhea with e/o GVH on endoscopy.
He also
had hematuria, but no evidence of BK virus. He started
photopheresis.
Diarrhea abated but LFTs rose. Therapy attempted for GVH of
liver using pulse of prednisone and increase in CellCept with
stabilization but no significant improvement.
10. Received 1mg of Pentostatin on [**2171-6-14**].
11. Liver Biopsy c/w GVHD. Started Rituxan for 4 weeks in
5/[**2171**].

rifabutin

- Diabetes mellitus type 2
- Chemo related heart failure and cardiomyopathy, EF 35-40%

Social History:
He is married and lives at home with his wife & children. He is
