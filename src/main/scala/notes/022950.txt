Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Central line placement
Arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 year-old female with reported history of
congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, pacemaker,
diabetes, anemia, and hypertension who was transfered from
[**Hospital3 7571**]intubated with hypoxic respiratory failure
secondary to worsening multifocal pneumonia.  She was intubated
and sedated upon arrival so all information as per outside
hospital reports.  She had been recently admitted to a
rehabilitation center after a pelvic fracture from a fall.  She
was found at her rehabilitation center to have evidence of a
bibasilar infiltrate on chest x-ray.  She was initially started
on Ceftriaxone on [**4-19**].  After several days of treatment, she
continued to be febrile to 102 with an increasing oxygen
requirement.  Her antibiotics were changed to levofloxacin.  She
continued to be febrile and hypoxic to the 60s.  She was
transfered to a local emergency department where she was
promptly intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  She
received clindamycin 600mg, sloumedrol 125 and 2 u PRBC.  She
was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU.  On arrival, she was intubated
and sedated with good oxygenation.

5. Anemia
6. Hypertension
7. GERD
8. Status post pubic ramus fracture and ORIF in [**3-4**].

Social History:

admission.  She doesn't drink or smoke.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 87 year-old female with reported history of
congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, pacemaker,
diabetes, anemia, and hypertension who was admitted for hypoxic
respiratory failure from a multifocal pneumonia.
.
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Her hypoxic respiratory failure
was attributed to her multifocal pneumonia.  She was found to
have a positive urinary legionalla antigen.  She was continued
on levofloxacin to complete a 21 day course.  With treatment,
she was weaned from the ventilator on hospital day 7.  At the
time of discharge, she was oxygenating well on room air.
.
2. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Her metabolic acidosis was
attributed to a lactate acidosis.  There was no evidence of
ketosis.  Her acidosis corrected with treatment of her
pneumonia.
.
3. Coronary artery disease: On admission, she had a troponin
leak without evidence of ischemia on EKG.  This was attributed
to a demand ischemia.  She was maintained on aspirin.  Her
beta-blocker and angiotensin receptor blocker were restarted
once her blood pressure tolerated it.
.
4. Congestive heart failure: Her BNP was not elevated and she
appeared euvolemic on admission.  Her volume status was
monitored closely.  An echocardiogram showed a normal ejection
fraction.  Her outpatient lasix was restarted once she was
taking adequate oral intake.
.
5. Hypertension: She was normotensive on admission.  Her
beta-blocker and angiotensin receptor blocker were held in the
setting of hypotension in the ICU.  These medications were
restarted once she was extubated.  Her blood pressure remained
elevated.  Therefore, she was started on an nitrate and her
beta-blocker was increased.  This is a particularly important
parameter to follow as she has history of flash pulmonary edema.
 Her blood pressure medications should continue to be
uptitrated.
.
6 Diabetes: Her oral hypoglycemic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was held during the
admission.  She intially required an insulin drip for adequate
glucose control.  She was subsequently transitioned to an
insuling sliding scale.  Her oral hypoglycemic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was
restarted once she was taking adequate oral intake.
.
7 Anemia: Her hematocrit remained stable throughout the
admission.
.
8. Diarrhea: She had several days of loose stools.  Given the
antibiotic use, there was some concern for c.diff.  She had
stool sent for c.diff, which was negative x1.  An additional
sample was also pending at time of discharge.  Her diarrhea had
resolved.
.
9. GERD: She was maintained on pantoprazole.
.
10. FEN: She was intially maintained on tube feeds while she was
intubated.  Her diet was advanced once she was extubated.  Her
fluid status was monitored as above.
.
11. Access: She had a central line and an arterial line placed
in the ICU.  Once she was transfered to the floor, she had
peripheral IVs.
.
12. Full Code
.
14. Dispo: She was discharged to an acute rehabiltiation center.
 She will need aggressive physical therapy as she is
considerably weakened after her critical illness and intubation.
