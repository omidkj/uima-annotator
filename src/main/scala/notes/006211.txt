Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue and Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter placement

History of Present Illness:
72M with 3-month h/o glioblastoma (presented with right
homonymous hemianopsia) s/p involved-field radiation therapy and
temozolomide (last dose on [**2179-7-22**]) presents with several days
of shortness of breath and several weeks of fatigue/abulia.
Sent to OSH for CTA, which revealed large bilateral PEs.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 724**] (neuro-oncologist) was made aware and requested that the
patient come to [**Hospital1 18**] for heparin drip and admission to the
hospital for further management.

In the ED, initial vitals were 98.3 85 116/78 18 98%.  Labs were
significant for urine glucose of 1000 and ketones of 10.  Bicarb
21 down from 27 the day prior and BUN 27, Cr 0.6. Patient given
Heparin drip with bolus.  While in the ED, he became hypotensive
to systolics in the 80s, but responsive to 1L NS.  He is not a
candidate for lysis given his glioblastoma.  Patient was seen by
cardiology for possible clot retrieval, but BLE ultrasound
showed non-occlusive thrombus in left popliteal [**Last Name (LF) 5703**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] went to
cath lab for IVC filter and transfer to the CCU for further
monitor.

In the cath lab, the patient received IVC filter through right
femoral [**First Name3 (LF) 5703**] with no complications.

On arrival to the floor, patient remained stable without
complaints but was lethargic.

In-house labs:

Studies:
MRI head [**2179-8-2**] - Stable left occipital rim-enhancing lesion
without significant increase in blood volume, but with increased
choline and decreased NAA in voxels 4 and 14, which may be
suggestive of neoplasm.  Mildly increased vasogenic edema
compared to the prior examination.

BLE US in ED [**2179-8-3**] - Nonocclusive thrombus in the left
popliteal [**Month/Day/Year 5703**].
CTA at OSH [**2179-8-3**] - large bilateral pleural effusions
TTE [**2179-8-4**] - Mild right ventricular cavity dilation with free
wall hypokinesis. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Normal left ventricular cavity size and regional/global systolic
function.

Brief Hospital Course:
72M with 3-month h/o glioblastoma s/p radiation therapy and
temozolomide (last dose on [**2179-7-22**]) presents with several days
of shortness of breath and several weeks of fatigue/abulia,
diagnosed as bilateral PE and L DVT.

Active:
# PE: Patient initially present with SOB and fatigue and found
to have bilateral PE by CTA at OSH.  Transferred here by his
neuro-oncologist for further management.    Started on hep gtt
in ED.  Experienced transient hypotension in the ED with SBP to
the 80s that was fluid responsive.  Not a candidate for
thrombolysis or clot retrieval given glioblastoma and clot
burden in lower extremeties.  Sent to cath lab [**2179-8-3**] for IVC
filter placement and transferred to CCU.  No post cath
complications.  He has been hemodynamically stable here in the
CCU with pressures in the 110s.  Hep gtt was continued to goal
PTT at 60-80.  He was transitioned to long-term anticoagulation
with lovenox 1 mg/kg for continued therapy of his PE
indefinitely, given setting of malignancy.  Transthoracic
echocardiogram [**2179-8-4**] showed mild right ventricular cavity
dilation with free wall hypokinesis and mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.  IVC filter will likely be left in
permanently per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].

Chronic:
# Glioblastoma:  He is s/p involved-field cranial irradiation
with concomitant
temozolomide from [**2179-5-4**] to [**2179-6-15**].  However, given profound
fatigue, his neuro-oncoligist will hold off on additional cycles
of temozolomide chemotherapy for the time being.  He was
continued on his home dose of dexamethasone and keppra upon
admission, but keppra discontinued prior to discharge per
neuro-oncology recommendations, since it may be partially
responsible for his spurts of anger, he has not had any seizures
yet, and peritumoral edema appears to be controlled well with
dexamethasone.  Palliative care assisting with discussion on
long-term goals of care.

# Abulia/Fatigue: Has improved with methylphenidate treatment in
recent weeks.  Methylphenidate was continued during the
admission.

# Diabetes: Stable.  Patient was maintained on ISS while in
house and his home metformin was held.

Transitional:
# PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]: Follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] as an outpatient.
# Will need to discuss duration of anticoagulation therapy with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] at follow up visit
