   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2156-12-5**] 11:58 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: post ct removal / pneumo

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old man with severe AS/CAD
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
post ct removal / pneumo
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL

HISTORY: Aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, chest tube
removal.

TWO VIEWS. Comparison with the previous study done [**2156-12-3**]. A
left chest tube, endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube,
mediastinal drain, and pulmonary arterial line have been
withdrawn. There is interval improvement in streaky density at
the left base, which probably represents subsegmental
atelectasis. There is interval development of increased density
at the right base, also consistent with subsegmental
atelectasis. A small area of consolidation at the bases cannot
be excluded. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, new or
increased since the previous study. The patient is status post
median sternotomy. Widening of the superior mediastinum
consistent with postsurgical change, has improved.

IMPRESSION: Streaky density at the lung bases consistent with
subsegmental atelectasis. Small area of consolidation at the
lung bases cannot be excluded. Small bilateral pleural effusions
due to postsurgical change from the mediastinum.

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic
function likely depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal RV
systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Simple
atheroma in aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Simple
atheroma in ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Mildly dilated descending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral
regurgitation.] There is hypokinesis of the inferior segments.
3, The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

POST-BYPASS:
Patient removed from cardiopulmonary bypas
