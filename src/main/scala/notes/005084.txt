Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent x2 to the right
coronary artery


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] F with diabetes mellitus, HTN, HLD, NIDDM, cerebral aneyrysm
s/p clipping and carotid artery shunt 40 years ago presents to
cath lab with STEMI.
.
This morning after leaving the shower, she developed a severe
headache described as occurring suddenly. Her family checked her
sugar which was fine and took a blood pressure, which was very
high to SBP 260. The patient's daughter was concerned because
the pt did not feel like going out this morning due to fatigue
and headache and she typically is quite active. 911 was called
and the patient was brought to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. On arrival to the ED
she developed [**9-22**] chest pressure with radiation straight to the
back, and was found to have ST segment elevations in inferior,
anterior, and lateral leads. The patient was bolused with
heparin given high dose aspirin, and received 600 mg plavix. The
pt was started on a nitro drip. A non con head CT was performed
which demonstrated no acute bleed. She was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] cath lab.
.
In the cath lab, pt was found to be right dominant, with 90%
proximal calcific focal lesion followed by diffusely disease
mild to moderate calcific segment, then distal 80% calcific
focal lesion. The pt had stenting of proximal and distal RCA
with deployment of 2 non-overlapping Integrity BMS and had
angioseal applied to RCFA. She received 115 cc of Omnipaque
contrast.
.
On the floor, she states feeling well. She denies chest pain
currently, shortness of [**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) 691**] recent symptoms of
orthopnea, PND, chest pain other than this morning. Her daughter
does note that she has ankle swelling at baseline. Her exercise
capacity is approximately walking one block that is limited [**2-13**]
to fatigue and knee pain. She is active with wheelchair and
walker.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

**PTCA RESULTS
  RCA

PTCA COMMENTS:
Initial angiography revealed a diffusely diseased proximal RCA
with a
relatively focal 90% calcific stenosis and a distal 80% focal
calcific
lesion. We planned to treat both with PTCA and stenting. A 6F
sheath was
already in place. Heparin was administered for anticoagulation,
and
therapeutic ACTs were confirmed throughout the case. A 6F JR4
guide
provided adequate support.  Prowater wire crossed both lesions
with
little difficulty. The proximal stenosis was dilated with a 2.5
x 12 mm
Apex balloon at 10 atm. The distal stenosis was dilated with the
same
balloon at 11 atm. The proximal lesion was again dilated with
the same
balloon at 13 atm. The distal lesion was stented with a 2.75 x
15 mm
Integrity delivered at 8 atm. The proximal lesion was stented
with a 3.0
x 22 mm Integrity delivered at 10 atm. Final angiography
revealed no
residual stenosis, no evidence of dissection and TIMI 3 flow.
Right
femoral angiography revealed an arteriotomy site appropriate for

closure, and a 6F AngioSeal was deployed with adequate
hemostasis.
