History of Present Illness:
48F current smoker with HTN, asthma, DMII and morbid obesity
recently discharged AMA on azithromycin and prednisone for
presumed pneumonia v COPD flare who came to ED for acute
respiratory distress. Patient states her breathing has been
difficult for the past several months but especially so over the
past two days. Had difficulty sleeping last night due to
persistent nocturnal cough. Today, pt was able to carry out
errands normally. In the evening, while sitting and watching TV,
pt noted acute onset of shortness of breath. She was gasping for
air and felt unable to catch her breath. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] any chest pain
or coughing episode. Per EMS, patient had 85% RA sat and one
word dyspnea. Current symptoms are similar to past episodes
though this was worse. At baseline, pt has dyspnea on exertion
walking up two flights of stairs. Denies fevers or chills, PND,
nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, chest pain, abdominal pain,
dysuria, urinary frequency, or calf pain. Patient does endorse
some orthopnea and chronic cough productive of brownish sputum
which has not changed in character. Also notes 50lbs weight gain
over the past 2-3 months along with persistent lower extremity
edema.
.
Of note, patient had recent hospitalization [**Date range (1) 18727**] for
shortness of breath thought to be due to COPD exacerbation, CAP,
and/or fluid overload. CTA was negative at the time. Urine
culture was positive for E.coli so she received one dose of
ceftriaxone but refused further treatment. Patient refused
further work-up so she was discharged AMA on azithromycin,
prednisone, and albuterol.
.
In the ED, initial VS were HR 132, RR: 30-40  130/p sat low 80s
on RA while receiving albuteral treatment.  She was placed on a
100% NRB initially with sats in the 90s, RR to 25. Then started
on BiPap with HR down to 100s and RR down to 20s. Exam notable
for diffuse rhonchi, bibasilar crackles and poor air movement.
Labs notable for lactate of 2.2, glucose of 345, white count of
12.4, trop 0.03. CXR showed opacities at b/l bases L>R. Given
levofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin in setting of recent
admission and also 40mg IV lasix. EKG without ischemic changes.

.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is appropriate and without
complaints stating her breathing is better. She continues to
have a productive cough and has some difficulty speaking more
than [**2-12**] sentences.

PERTINENT LABS
[**2103-3-26**]  Lung volumes are low causing bronchovascular
crowding and accentuation of the heart size. There is mild
vascular
congestion. No pleural effusion or pneumothoarx is seen. There
is mild
cardiomegaly. The right pulmonary artery appears enlarged.

[**2103-3-27**] ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Due to the technically suboptimal nature of this study, the
presence of clinically significant diastolic dysfunction of the
left ventricle cannot be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
48yo F smoker with hx of morbid obesity, asthma/COPD, and
smoking history h/w acute onset shortness of breath.
.
# Shortness of breath [**3-15**] COPD and dCHF: Likely multifactorial
due to COPD flare and volume overload. Trigger for flare is
unclear but likely was incompletely treated during last
hospitalization and seems patient's outpatient regimen is not
currently optimized. Chronically patient likely has elements of
OSA and obesity hypoventilation in addition to COPD/asthma
exacerbated by ongoing smoking. Patient has no documented
history of heart failure and has only mildly elevated BNP but on
exam appears volume overloaded. Patient has mildly elevated
lactate some relative hypotension and leukocytosis somewhat
concerning for infection, though her CXR and history are not
suggestive of this. CAP coverage with levofloxacin for 5 days is
sufficient as she was hospitalized only for one day previously
and has no other risk factors. Finally, PE could be causing pt's
acute tachypnea though likelihood seems low given recent
negative CTA. She was treated with inhalers, advair and
ipratropium (no albuterol as this caused aflutter, see below)
and prednisone 60mg burst for 5 days for COPD flare. She was
aggressively diuresed successfully. This did result in transient
[**Last Name (un) **], but this improved with diuresis ([**Last Name (un) **] thought to be [**3-15**] poor
forward flow). BLood cultures x2 negative; urine culture and
sputum culture also negative.

# A Flutter 1:2: unknown hx but occurred acutely after using
albuterol treatment. She was totally asx and BP was maintained
throughout. She rec'd Lopressor IV 5mg x2; dilt
