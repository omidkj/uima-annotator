Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 17865**]
Chief Complaint:
IVC thrombus extending to the R atrium

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
64-year-old man with hep C, HCC, HTN with known IVC thrombus who
presented per advice from his oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], after a
recent CT showed the IVC thrombus extending to the right atrium.
The patient reports some chronic RUQ pain but denies any other
symptom. No palpitations, no chest pain, no loss of
consciousness.
.
He was recently diagnosed with HCC and underwent chemoembolism
in 7/[**2100**]. CT in [**8-/2100**] showed IVC thrombus with extension close
to the right atrium. Given history of hemoperitoneum requiring
multiple transfusions, anticoagulation was not started.
.
Patient underwent an outpatient abd CT on [**2100-11-15**] which
showed the IVC thrombus now extending into the R atrium. He was
advised by his oncologist to come to the ED.
.
On presentation to the ED, patient was stable with T 98.8, HR
82, BP 145/88, RR 18, 99%RA. Labs revealed stable Hct of 38.3.
EKG was unchanged from prior with borderline first degree AV
block. Head CT was unremarkable. Cards were consulted and, per
ED sign-out, did not want any intermediate intervetion. Heme-onc
recommended starting heparin gtt without any initial bolus.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient remained stable and was not
on heparin gtt yet.
.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary
frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness,
focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
He does report chronic pain in RUQ and right side of chest.

[**11-15**] CT Abd/Pelvis
1. Extension tumor from the periphery of the right lobe of the
liver medially to involve the hepatic vein confluence with
associated increase in tumor thrombus, which now extends into
the right atrium through the hepatic vein confluence.
2. Nonocclusive thrombus within the right portal vein posterior
and segmental anterior brancehes branches.
3. Right lower lobe 4 mm nodule is new since [**2100-9-13**] and may
represent
metastatic focus.
4. Ill definied enhacememt of the mesentery may represent
perioneal spread of tumor.

[**11-19**] Head CT
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality. MRI is more
sensitive for the detection of mass lesion.


Brief Hospital Course:
64-year-old man with HCC, hep C, IVC thrombous now extending to
RA concerning for hemodynamic compromise and occlusive
thrombosis.
.
# IVC thrombus: Patient underwent an outpatient abd CT on
[**2100-11-15**] which showed the IVC thrombus now extending into the
R atrium. He was advised by his oncologist to come to the ED. On
presentation to the ED, patient was stable with T 98.8, HR 82,
BP 145/88, RR 18, 99%RA. Labs revealed stable Hct of 38.3. EKG
was unchanged from prior with borderline first degree AV block.
Head CT was unremarkable. Cards were consulted and, per ED
sign-out, did not want any intermediate intervetion. Heme-onc
recommended starting heparin gtt without any initial bolus. On
arrival to the ICU, the patient remained stable and was started
on a heparin gtt.  The thrombus is most likely the tumor itself.
The heparin gtt was stopped on [**11-21**] and Mr [**Known lastname 79303**] was started
on lovenox 80mg (1.5mg/kg once daily) as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. A  TTE
was ordered to further evaluate the thrombus and cardiac
function, however the patient was unwilling to undergo the
procedure.  The patient remained stable on lovenox prior to
discharge. Ideally life long anticoagulation is indicated in
this individual with extensive thrombus which could quickly
develop into a rapidly fatal Budd Chiari syndrome.  However
monitoring for signs of bleeding should continue in this patient
with  a h/o hemoperitoneum.  Further discussion about
anticoagulation, prognosis, and treatment was attempted in
house, however Mr [**Name13 (STitle) **] was unwilling to discuss his wishes.
Code status and further anticoagulation vs palliative measures
will have to be further addressed as an outpatient with his
primary oncologist and PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] compliance is also an issue
as the patient has limit access to housing. 10 days of lovenox
was given (the maximum attentable free of charge) to allow Mr
[**Known lastname 79303**] to be supplied until follow up. However Coumadin may
have to be considered if anticoagulation will continue.

# HCC: growing tumor burden per serial abd CTs, s/p
chemoembolization in [**2100-7-27**]
with new lung lesion suspicious for mets found on recent CT.
Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
.
# Chronic Pain: Pt with compliants of chronic abdominal  pain.
Pt was started on dilaudid and increased to 2-3mg IV Q2 while in
house.  He was titrated back to his home dose of medicines by
dischange. The outpt regimen (confirmed with the PCP Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) 61741**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 68410**])) was Oxycodone SR 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] and oxycodone
5-10 mg prn q4h. He was given a Rx for 2 day since he should
have had sufficiant pain meds at home from previous
prescriptions.
.
# Psych: At times the patient was demanding and combative,
threatening to throw multiple staff members "out the window". He
frequently refused therapy and lab draws. On the night prior to
admission the patient briefly became confused after receiving
4mg of xanax overnight. He returned to baseline the next
morning.
