Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91895**] arrived on [**2186-1-28**] to the ICU inebriated but
protecting his airway well. Patient went to CTA head and neck,
MRI C-spine w/contrast to evaluate possible central cord and/or
c-spine fracture. He was seen by Vascular surgery and
Neurosurgery as a R vetebral art occlusion was picked up on that
scan. A heparin gtt and ASA 325 were started for that occlusion
with the understanding that the heparin drip would be stopped
post-operatively when the spine surgery team was able to repair
his thoracic fracture. He did well overnight after started on
dilaudid PCA. He was kept on log-roll precautions in a C-collar
overnight.

The following morning ([**1-29**]) a chest showed complete
opacification of the left lung. At this point he was intubated
and subsequent bronchoscopy showed large mucus plug. ABG after
intubation showed resp acidosis. He developed possibly new LLE
weakness. Stat MRI/MRA head and neck were ordered which further
characterized the R vertebral artery occlusion as intramural
dissection v. thrombosis could not be ruled out. The scan also
showed slow diffusion of the Right hemisphere. Neurosurg
recommended continuing heparin gtt with goal PTT 50-60. A repeat
bronch on [**1-30**] showed no mucus plugs, BAL sent 2+ GPC,
coccobaccilus, started on vanc/cef/cirpo for VAP coverage.  He
spiked a fever to 103.3 and cultures were sent. The following
day on [**1-31**] a repeat bronch showed RLL mucus plug, and CXR now
with diffuse haziness.

On [**2-1**] he was taken to the OR by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**] (spine surgery) for
PSIF thoracic spine. The procedure went well and his logroll
restrictions were removed. He was transferred back to the TSICU.


[**2-2**]--[**2-6**]: Postoperative course c/b bilateral pneumonias and
acute lung injury requiring prolonged ventilator support. He
underwent daily spontaneous breathing trials which failed due to
tachypnea, tachycardia and O2 saturations to the low 80s, high
70s. He continued to spike occasional fevers and a CT scan
demonstrated bilateral pneumonias. BAL from [**1-30**] grew H. flu,
for which he was appropriately covered by Cefipime. Blood and
urine cultures remained negative throughout. I&D consultants
assisted with antibiotic management and by [**2-6**] white count had
normalized, he was afebrile and all antibiotics were
discontinued. Tube feeds were given via NGT (dobhoff) and
advanced to goal without difficulty.

On [**2-7**] he was sucessfully extubated (HD#11 POD#6) and diuresed
3 liters. He remained hemodynamically stable. NGT & Foley were
removed. He started on PO's and tolerated a regular diet.
Physical therapy and occupational therapy were consulted to
evaluate his mobility, and he remained in TLSO brace when
ambulating and cervical collar at all times.

On [**2-8**] he was afebrile, hemodynamically stable with stable
respiratory status and was transferred to the surgical floor. On
the floor he continued to do well. His pain was well controlled
with an oral pain regimen and a clonidine patch. His LUE
remained with 4/5 strength and improving, and neurology was
following for this. A splint was placed to prevent contractures
to his arm. Incentive spirometry and pulmonary toileting were
continued and he remained afebrile without an elevated WBC
count. The 325 mg of aspirin was continued per vascular surgery
for right vertebral artery occlusion. He was tolerating a
regular diet and voiding adequate amounts of urine.

He remained in the cervical collar as well as the TLSO brace
when ambulating. His mobility improved while working with
physical and occupational therapy. On [**2186
