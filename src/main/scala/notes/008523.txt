History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 26248**] is a 54 yo F with HLD, HTN, and COPD who presented
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with chest pain from her PCP's office.
.
As per the pt, the pain initially started on Saturday evening.
She was out at a restaurant when it started, and said the pain
was a [**8-30**] then, was all around her chest, felt like a cramping
pain that would go up both sides of her face and down the inner
aspect of both arms.  She states she tried SLNTG x 3, and since
the pain didn't go away, she thought it wasn't cardiac in
nature.  She then tried some percocet she had at home, but that
didn't help either.  The pain was associated with diaphoresis,
SOB, and N/V.  The pain persisted throughout Sunday.  On Monday,
she then had a sharp pain in the upper left chest that worsened
with inspiration.  This pain didn't radiate in nature, and was
again a [**2193-7-29**] in intensity.   She again tried percocet, with no
relief of the pain.
.
On Wednesday (today), she states the pain finally subsided to a
level where she could eat, and could stand up, so she went to
her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] PCP did an EKG, gave a dose of ASA 325 mg, and
immediately sent her to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation.
.
Upon initial presentation, the pt's vitals were: HR: 90 BP:
80/40, RR: 18. In the ED, the pt's EKG was concerning with ST
changes in the inferior leads.  The pt was started on a heparin
drip, an integrillin drip, was plavix loaded with 600 mg, and
given SLNTG x 2 and Metoprolol 5 mg IV x1, and sent to the
cardiac cath lab for revascularization.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis. S/he
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system

demonstrated two vessel disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent disease. The LAD had an 80-90% mid vessel stenosis with
minimal
plaquing in the remainder of the vessel. The Cx had diffuse
minimal
plaquing throughout. The RCA had a total mid vessel occlusion.
The
distal RCA filled via left to right and right to right
collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a central aortic
pressure of
95/59 mmHg.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2193-6-27**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

DISCHARGE LABS:

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 26248**] is a 54 yo F with HLD, HTN, and COPD who presented
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with chest pain from her PCP's office, found to
have a STEMI now s/p cardiac catheterization with 2 BMS to the
RCA and residual coronary disease in the LAD and thrombus in the
PDA.
.
# CORONARIES:  The pt, while having had stenting (BMS x 2) in
the RCA, still has coronary disease in the LAD, which will
likely require intervention at a later date. She was initially
started on Integrillin, which she recieved for a total of 18
hours.  During this hospitalization, she was started on full
dose aspirin; she was loaded with 60mg prasugrel and then
started on 10mg daily. The importance of taking [**Last Name (un) 8114**] medication
daily without stopping was stressed to the pt. Pt was initially
hypotensive, so any antihypertensives were held. She required a
short course of neosynephrine after cardiac cath. She was not
started on a BBlocker given her severe, steroid-dependent
respiratory disease. Her home Lasix was re-sarted upon
discharge. Her home nifedipine was discontinued. Her home
simvistatin was changed to atorvastatin.
.
# PUMP: Pt did not carry a dx of CHF, but echo was done for
evaluation given that she was s/p cath and STEMI. Echo showed
LVEF of 50%, so ACEi was not started. She results above for full
echo interpretation. Given the long-term steroid use, there was
concern that part of her hypotension was due to adrenal
supression. Cosyntropin stimulation test was done, and her
cortisol response was appropriate.
.
# RHYTHM: Pt had v-tach during the cardiac cath requiring
cardioversion.  The v-tach made the pt hemodynamically unstable.
She was initially hypotensive requireing pressors after cath,
but pressors were sucessfully weaned soon fater procedure. She
had no further episodes of v-tach and was hemodynamically stable
through the rest of her hospital course.
.
# GERD: Pt's home PPI initially switched to an H2 blocker, but
Prasugrel does not have possible interaction with PPIs that
Plavix does. Home dose of Protonix was re-started.
.
# COPD: Pt has baseline COPD on many medications. We continued
her home steroids inhalers/nebulized treatments prn and fo
