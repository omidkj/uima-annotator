Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
worsening SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
status post ICD interrogation and reprogramming


History of Present Illness:
Pt. is an 82 yo Russion speaking M w/ h/o CAD (3VD refusing
CABG), CHF (EF-20%),s/p ICD for sick sinus syn., HTN, DM, A.fib
who presented from [**Hospital1 **] w/ worsening SOB. Pt. was w/out
complaints two days prior, ambulating w/out SOB. Yesterday
noticed inc. SOB, now +SOB at rest. Inc. abd girth. Denies any
fevers, CP, palpitations. Pt found to be tachy (120's), hypoTN
(sbp low 80's). At [**Hospital1 **], given 1.5L fluid, sbp stayed in
80's. Transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further eval. Started on Levophed
at 7 mcg/min. Pacer interoggated by EP, found to have V-paced
rhythm at 120's (ICD max tracking rate). V-pacing inhibition
revealed AT at 135 bpm with high degree AV block. Overdrive
atrial pacing performed--> sinus at 50 bpm--> pacer changed back
to DDD ( AV pacing at 70 bmp). Max ventricular tracking rate
decreased to 100. Pt remained rel hypoT (SBP in 80's on
levophed). admitted to CCU for BP stabilization and diuresis.
Levophed was weaned off in ED w/ SBP>90.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hypotension: Pt was weaned off Levophed with SBP's stable in
90-110's. Cultures remained negative to date.

Cardiac:Pump-Pt. w/ CHF(EF20%) decompensated [**1-18**] atrial tachy.
Also likley has significant RV dysfunction contrinuting to
hypotension. weaned off of levophed. Held BB, nitro, ACEI
secondary to tenuous BP's.  He was given one dose of Lasix with
poor effect and decreasing uring output.  Family refused Swan
Ganz monitoring.    In this setting, he was given a gentle bolus
of normal saline.  His urine output subsequently increased
appropriately.

3 Vessel coronary artery disease w/ refusing CABG.  Pt was
without signs of current/new ischemia and had stable cardiac
enzymes. ASA, statin were continued. Pt was not a candidate for
CABG during this admission.

Rhythm- AT: ICD interrogated and reprogrammed. Pt was maintained
on amiodarone and heparin gtt. His coumadin was held in case he
needed AT ablation.  At the end of his admission his amiodarone
was increased to 200 tid, which was to be continued for 6 days.
Atfter this, he was to be weaned to 200 [**Hospital1 **] for another weak and
then to be stabilized on 200 qd thereafter/

Coagulopathy-The patient't INR was increased, in the range of
INR 2.4-5.7. Given, his LFT's were within normal limits, he was
given 1 dose vitamin K with good effect.  At the end of his
admission, he was switched back to coumadin from heparin.

[**Name (NI) 12329**] Pt hypotensive on admission, likely [**1-18**] CHF. His BP meds
were held during this admission.

[**Name (NI) 3672**] Pt w/ audible wheezing [**1-18**] CHF and/or COPD. CXR w/ sm. rt.
pleural effusion. He was given alb/atrovent nebs prn, keeping
sats>93%. with O2 as needed.

DM- The patient was maintained on insulin sliding scale with QID
fingerstick checks.

Renal- His renal insufficiency and poor urine output was
believed likely secondary to decreased perfusion due to his CHF.
 He did not initially respond well to Lasix.  However, he was
given 250cc NS bolus over 1h with an appropriate increase in
output. His renal insufficiency improved with resolution of his
acute CHF and he is now at his likely new baseline.

Conjunctivitis-the patient was found to have crusty discharge
from b/l eyes during the admssion and was started on
erythromycin eye drops for 10 days total.  His conjunctivitis
improved significantly with this treatment.

[**Name (NI) 3687**]   Pt exhibited agitation and confusion nightly.  He was
maintained on evening dose of seroquel 12.5 qhs and occasionally
required 1:1 sitter and/or restraints for safety in the
evenings.

Code-After discussion with the patient's son and wife (who
deferred further medical decisions to her son), the patient was
made DNR/DNI.  The son was made aware of hospice services, if
the family feels that they are ready for this.
