History of Present Illness:
39 yo male with multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2114**] He was
initially treated with Decadron alone and then began treatment
with thalidomide and dexamethasone, which was started in
09/[**2114**].  He also underwent radiation therapy to the sacral area
in 11/[**2114**].  His course was complicated by a DVT and PE at the
time of his diagnosis, and he was on anticoagulation
particularly while receiving thalidomide and Decadron.  He was
noted for a very good response to his treatment with a repeat
bone marrow biopsy in [**2115-3-19**] showing
5% plasma cells as well as marked improvement in his lesion in
the sacral area. In [**Month (only) 547**]/05, he was noted to have a drop in his
white blood count, and repeat bone marrow biopsy showed
increasing plasma cells with 20% involvement.  His IgG level had
also increased with a concern for more refractory disease.  He
received a cycle of DVD chemotherapy on [**2115-4-25**].  Following
this therapy, he had increasing pain with increasing IgG levels
and SPEP with a poor response to therapy, he was switched to
treatment with Velcade and Decadron.  He was given four cycles
of this therapy.  A repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy
revealed CD138 staining of plasma cells for approximately 10% of
the cellularity.  His IgG level had decreased to a low of 1680.
His SPEP had also decreased to 1100 mg/dL of the total protein.
He then received high-dose Cytoxan on [**2115-7-25**] in preparation
for stem cell mobilization with his stem cell collections
completed during the week of [**2115-8-5**].  He then was admitted
on [**2115-8-23**] for high-dose chemotherapy with melphalan followed
by stem cell transplant.  Followup evaluation of his disease at
2 months post-transplant at the end of [**10/2115**] showed
approximately 10% involvement by plasma cells by CD138 staining.
 This was essentially stable, and he was continued to be
monitored.  His IgG level had decreased to 1314 following his
transplant.  On [**2116-1-19**], pt has increasing pain in the
left groin area.  An x-ray of the area did not show any evidence
for fracture or lesion.  He did undergo an MRI as well, which
showed a lesion near the groin area with no pathologic fracture.
 He received radiation therapy to this area.  Also in this
setting, his IgG level had now increased to almost 4 g.  He
underwent a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy by his local
oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59071**], which revealed extensive relapsed
disease with plasma cell myeloma accounting for 80-90% of the
core biopsy specimen.  As a result of this, it was felt that Mr.
[**Known lastname 40270**] required more systemic therapy in addition to continuing
the radiation therapy to the groin area, he was started Velcade
with Decadron [**2116-3-2**].  He had been requiring increasing
platelet transfusion support prior to beginning Velcade as well
as during the course of Velcade with a platelet count less than
20,000 as well as red blood cell transfusion support, his IgG
level had increased to 7 g with his SPEP now representing 50% or
4900 mg/dL of the total protein.  He was started on more
aggressive chemotherapy with D-PACE on [**2116-3-4**].  Within one
week, he was noted for an increase of his IgG to over 6 g.  As
he clearly had an agressive refractory myeloma, he is being
admitted for with a myeloablative transplant with cytoxan and
busulfan conditioning.  Mr. [**Known lastname 40270**] is being admitted today to
begin his allogeniec transplant.

Past Medical History:
1. Multiple myeloma as described above.
2. History of DVT and PE while receiving thalidomide, status
post 6 months of anticoagulation.
3. Recent pneumonia treated with a 14-day course of Levofloxacin
in 02/[**2116**].

Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40270**] previously worked as a florist but is currently
unemployed.  He does coach a girls basketball team and tries to
keep active although since his most recent admission, he has not
been keeping up with this.  He denies any
history of tobacco or alcohol use.  He is married with a very
supportive wife and has two young children, ages 4 and
1-year-old.

Family History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40270**] has no hematologic malignancies in his family.
There is type 2 diabetes in the family with elevated
cholesterol.  His mother died of a cerebrovascular accident.  He
has a brother and sister, both of whom have been HLA typed and
do not match him.  He currently has a non-related [**9-27**] HLA match

Pertinent Results:
.
[**6-2**] CXR: Slight improvement in the multiple patchy opacities
which may be consistent with improving multifocal pneumonia
.
[**6-2**] Line placement 1: Successful placement of a 7-French triple
lumen central line through the left internal jugular vein with
the tip in the superior vena cava. The line is ready for use
.
[**6-2**] Line Placement 2: Successful placement of a 29 cm
cuff-to-tip 10 French double- lumen tunneled [**Doctor Last Name 3075**] catheter
with the tip in the superior vena cava. The line is ready for
use.
.
[**6-2**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a
normal left ventricular filling pressure. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2116-5-22**], left ventricular systolic function now
appears slightly more vigorous.
.
[**6-2**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Normal ECG except for rate
.
[**6-8**] CXR: Stable appearance of multiple airspace opacities
within the bilateral lungs which may represent multifocal
pneumonia
.
[**6-8**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse ST-T changes are
nonspecific
.
[**6-8**] Transfusion reaction investigation: Mr [**Known lastname 40270**] had diffuse
trunk
and arm pain, tachycardia, mild hypertension and difficulty
breathing
while undergoing a transfusion of compatible red cells. Although
there
are a few laboratory parameters that are suspicious for
hemolysis (mildy
elevated LDH), other labs (negative DAT, normal haptoglobin) are
not
supportive of hemolysis, nor is his clinical picture. We feel
that this
reaction is an atypical non-hemolytic transfusion reaction that
does not
have a clear underlying cause. At this time we do not recommend
changes
in transfusion practice in this patient except careful
monitoring during
future transfusions.
.
[**6-9**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Non-specific diffuse T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2116-6-2**] no significant
diagnostic change.
.
[**6-11**] US Liver: No evidence of liver, gallbladder, or biliary
tree pathology to explain the patient's symptoms. Tiny 2 mm
polyp or non-shadowing stone in the gallbladder lumen. Small
bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**6-12**] CXR: The bilateral central venous lines are in stable
position. There is no pneumothorax. There is persistent left
lower lobe opacity presumably atelectasis which appears slightly
increased with the medial diaphragm obscured
