                            **FINAL REPORT [**2147-6-10**]**

   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2147-6-10**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
.
[**2147-6-9**] CXR
FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Straightening
of left
mediastinal border is present with loss of the normal
aorticopulmonary window contour. Confluent opacity is present in
the left retrocardiac region projecting posteriorly on the
lateral view. Peripherally there is an either pleural or
extrapleural opacity present but no blunting of the costophrenic
angles. Skeletal structures reveal degenerative changes in the
spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. Confluent left lower lobe opacity suspicious for pneumonia.
2. Widening of left mediastinal contour and loss of normal
aorticopulmonary interface. Consider chest CT to differentiate
prominent mediastinal fat from lymphadenopathy or a discrete
mass


Brief Hospital Course:
#Community-acquired pneumonia - Treated with 7 days of
levofloxacin. Blood cultures remained negative. Urinary
legionella antigen was negative. Displayed normal ambulatory
oxygen saturation prior to discharge. Recommended 4 week
follow-up CXR to ensure resolution.
.
#Abnormal CXR - [**2147-6-9**] exam revealed widening of the left
mediastinal contour and loss of the normal aorticopulmonary
interface. Chest CT was recommended to differentiate a prominent
mediastinal fat from lymphadenopathy or mass, but, despite
acknowledging that this radiographic finding could represent
malignancy, the patient declined CT due to significant
discomfort and orthopnea while supine in the scanner.
.
#Coronary artery disease - Mild troponin leak attributed to
strain/subendocardial ischemia in the setting of febrile
illness. Flat CK without acute ischemic EKG changes. Continued
aspirin, beta-blocker statin.
.
#Diabetes mellitus type II - Well-controlled on glipizide and
sliding scale insulin. Metformin held on admission but was
restarted upon discharge.
.
#Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - Continued advair and
bronchodilator nebs as needed.
.
#Hypertension - Well-controlled on beta-blocker and ACE
inhibitor.
.
#Hyperlipidemia - Continued statin.
