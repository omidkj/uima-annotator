Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
The patient was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in
[**2166**] after bone marrow biopsy was performed secondary to iron
deficiency anemia workup. She was treated with standard dose
chemotherapy and had a good response. She completed induction
and consolidation chemotherapy and achieved a complete
remission. Her course was complicated by severe bilateral
avascular necroses of the hips due to steroid use. She also had
multiple dental issues requiring extractions. [**Known firstname **] remained in
remission for several months but
ultimately showed signs of disease recurrence in her marrow. She
underwent reinduction and achieved once again a complete
remission. She did well until the summer of [**2168**] when she
developed evidence of relapse. She received induction
chemotherapy once again and achieved remission. This course was
complicated by neutropenic fever, development of a coagulative
negative staph bacteremia, left upper extremity DVT, aseptic
necrosis of the bilateral hips, and septic emboli of the
liver. [**Known firstname **] then underwent a nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem
cell transplant from matched unrelated donor with Campath
conditioning in [**2169-11-29**]. She did well and subsequently
achieved remission. Her posttransplant course was complicated by
the development of a sore throat and question of low level EBV
infection. There was some concern at that time by involvement
with a lymphoproliferative disease. Her EBV titer disappeared
upon withdrawal of her cyclosporine. She was followed by
quantitative EBV levels, which remained undetectable, and she
had
fully recovered from this. She had no definite evidence for
GVHD.
She remained in remission until her relapse in 10/[**2170**].
.
Since her relapse in [**8-/2171**], [**Known firstname **]
received treatment with hyper-CVAD in [**9-/2171**] and a donor
lymphocyte infusion on [**2171-11-5**].  She was again noted for
relapse of her ALL in [**12/2171**] and was admitted to the hospital
from [**2172-1-7**] to [**2172-2-26**].  She had persistent pain in the
perirectal area with incontinence and was found to have CNS
involvement of the cauda equina and received radiation therapy
to
her lower spine in 02/[**2171**].  She then received another cycle of
hyper-CVAD in [**1-/2172**] following the completion of her radiation
therapy.  Her day 14 bone marrow showed no residual leukemia and
she received another DLI on [**2172-2-18**].  She also received two
doses of intrathecal methotrexate on [**2172-2-25**] and [**2172-3-19**].
Unfortunately, by the end of [**2-/2172**], she was noted for
decreasing
counts and was admitted with concern for relapsed disease, which
was confirmed on bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.  Because of
her
debilitated state, [**Known firstname **] was not given any further treatment and
she was sent home with increased support and to follow up with
her local oncologist with a concern that her disease would
relapse or progress further.  However, since her discharge from
the hospital in [**3-/2172**], [**Known firstname **] improved with normalization of her
counts and no further evidence for disease recurrence.  She has
required no further treatment, but has had many chronic
complications. She developed increasing problems with [**Name2 (NI) 7809**]
with
constipation and intermittent diarrhea, as well as increasing
pain in the rectal area, as well as increasing pelvic and hip
pain. There have been no changes with MRI of the lower spine.
The
feeling was that she developed issues with anal stricture after
her cauda equina syndrome and radiation therapy along with a
neurogenic rectum that did not empty fully. After approximately
two years of significant stress with her bowel regimen and
attempts at anal dilatation, she underwent a diverting sigmoid
colostomy in [**11/2173**] under the direction of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] at [**Hospital1 18**].
She also has had issues of chronic hip pain due to osteonecrosis
of the hip and she is status post left hip replacement. In
[**Month (only) 958**]/[**2175-2-28**], [**Known firstname **] was noted for increasing shortness of
breath.  She underwent an echocardiogram, which was noted for a
drop in her ejection fraction to 35-40%.  She has been started
on
captopril.  She underwent an adenosine stress test, which did
not
show any evidence for coronary artery disease.  It was felt that
this may have been related to a viral illness.  She did undergo
a
repeat echocardiogram on [**2175-6-12**], which showed improvement to
about 40%.

[**Known firstname **] has been followed with continued normal counts until more
recently when labs from an outside hospital have shown increased
lymphocytes with atypical lymphocytes and decreasing neutrophils
with ANC of 700.  There were no immature cells noted and white
count, hematocrit and platelet count were normal. She had been
recovering from two upper respiratory infections. Given the
persistent change in her counts, [**Known firstname **] was seen today for
further
evaluation and was noted for 10% circulating blasts.  She
underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and is being admitted
for further evaluation and probable treatment.
