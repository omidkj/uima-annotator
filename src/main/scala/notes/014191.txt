Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2487**] was admitted on [**2151-2-21**]. He remained on heparin and
nitroglycerin until he was taken to the operating room on
[**2151-2-23**] where he underwent a redo sternotomy, CABG x 2, and MV
repair. He was transferred to the SICU in critical but stable
condition on propofol, insulin, epinephrine, levophed,
milrinone, vasopressin. He was seen by electrophysiology for his
permenant pacer as well as for atrial fibrillation with pressor
dependency. He was started on amiodarone. His IABP was removed
on POD #2. He was started on heparin for a fib. He was started
on tube feeds. He was seen by heart failure who recommended
TEE/cardioversion, and he was cardioverted successfully, but he
reverted to a fib. He remained in the ICU, on inotropes and
pressors for many days.  They were slowly weaned off with stable
hemodynamics.  Bilateral chest tubes were placed for large
effusions.   On [**3-6**] he was extubated. His milrinone was weaned
to off. On [**3-11**] he was seen by vascular surgery for R flank and
RLQ pain with a hematacrit and BP drop, retroperitoneal bleed
was found on CT scan, his heparin was stopped and he was
transfused. His creatinine rose to 3.0 after the bleed and
stabilized at 1.6.  Anticoagulation was stopped, and his
hematocrit stabilized without further intervention.
He was transferred to the floor on POD #20. His creatinine rose
to 1.6, but has remained there.  His Lasix was decreased due to
his creatinine.  He'd had a persistent, small, right apical
pneumothorax which was unchanged with his pleural chest tube on
suction, water seal, or clamped.  It was therefore removed, and
his post-removal chest x-ray showed no change.  His
hemodynamics, and respiratory status have remained stable, his
oxygen saturation on room air is 94-95%, and he is ready to be
discharged home today.
