Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19960**] is a 52 yo woman h/o COPD, breast cancer who
presented to an OSH for evaluation of shortness of breath.  She
notes she has not been feeling well for several weeks when she
noted pain in her back. Initially she was diagnosed with a
muscle spasm and given pain mediation. When the pain did not
subside she returned for further care and it was noted that she
had a rash that appeared to be consistant with shingles. She
describes the pain as a band from her abdomen to her back. She
was treated with a course of valtrex which she completed and the
rash resolved. Her pain persisted, despite treatment with
oxycodone and vicodin. Over the last several days, the patient
noted a sore throat and increasing oxygen requirement (she
typically is on 2L O2 NC at home). She also noted fevers to 102
at home and decreasing O2 sats from 90s to 79% with ambulation.
This past weekend (during storm) the patient was exceedingly
anxious after the electricity went out. She was trying to find
her oxygen tank and felt herself coughing so hard she could
barely catch her breath.
She denies having any chest pains or dizziness, N/V. She went to
an OSH for shortness of breath and back pain. On CXR she found
to have multifocal PNA, also notable on labs were a leukocytosis
to 24, d-dimer 1.2 (elevated). A CTA was performed however there
was dye leak into the left hand and the test was aborted. She
was given ceftriaxone and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival, she was noted to be afebrile with BPs in 120/60s, HR
105, breathing in 20s, O2 sats 80s on 2L. With albuterol and
ipratropium nebs and morphine her O2 sat was 90s on 4L and much
more comfortable. Noted on exam were a tense compartment in L
hand. Plastics was called to evaluate and recommended elevation
and frequent pulse checks. CT from the outside hospital shows
multifocal PNA, however given lack of contrast cannot evaluate
for PE. Notable on her labs in the ED were a leukocytosis with
left shift, elevated bicarb. She was started on 750mg
levofloxacin IV and 1L IVF was started prior to transfer to the
MICU. On admission to ICU, she was afebrile with BP 130/70s, HR
103, 95% 4L O2.
.
ROS: pertinent positives include headaches (several months),
poor appetite, constipation.  Denies any visual changes, chest
pains, N/V, URI, trouble swallowing, blood in stool or urine,
numbness/tingling, trouble walking.
She has not received the flu vaccine this year. Denies any
trauma.

Microbiology:
Blood cultures ([**2138-11-16**]):  negative x2.
Urine legionella ([**2138-11-17**]):  negative.
Nasopharyngeal aspirate DFA for influenza A/B:  negative.
.
Imaging:
.
CXR AP Port ([**2138-11-17**]):
Severe scoliosis with subsequent asymmetric ribcage. Linear
opacities in left lower lobe, most suggestive of atelectasis. No
consolidation or areas suggestive of pneumonia.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. No pleural
effusion.
.
AP Wrist ([**2138-11-17**]):
Overlying bandage or cast greatly obscures bony detail. No
definite fracture is seen. There is a lucency crossing the
navicular, though this could merely be due to the texture of the
overlying cast.
.
Dedicated rib films ([**2138-11-19**]):
No previous bone studies are available. Scoliosis of the
thoracic
spine, convex to the right and centered in the mid thoracic
region. No
definite acute fracture is appreciated. No evidence of
pneumothorax.
.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound ([**2138-10-21**]):
FINDINGS: There are no gallstones. The gallbladder is
unremarkable in appearance. The liver is within normal limits in
echotexture throughout. Main portal vein is patent.
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable right upper quadrant ultrasound.
Specifically, no
evidence of gallstones.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 52 year-old woman with history of COPD, breast cancer, herpes
zoster presenting with shortness of breath, increasing oxygen
requirements and subacute back pain.
.
1. Dyspnea/hypoxia.
Differential diagnosis included pneumonia, COPD exacerbation,
ACS, and PE. Given the acute on chronic presentation of
shortness of breath, including fever and leukocytosis, the most
likely cause for her symptoms was infectious. Clinically it was
apparent that her pain (recent zoster and ?rib fractures on OSH
CXR) was limiting her ability to take full, deep breaths.  Her
tachycardia and dyspnea also were also concerning for PE
(history of malignancy is risk factor). In terms of cardiac
etiology, ACS was a consideration but less likely given the
radiographic findings of pulmonary infiltrate at OSH, fever, and
white count.  Lastly, her dyspnea also had a component of
restrictive physiology, given her back pain which is worse with
inspiration.
.
She was started on prednisone 60 mg po for a slow taper, started
on levofloxacin for a five day course, her home nebs were
continued, and her oxygen was weaned off as tolerated.  Cardiac
enzymes were negative x2.  She underwent dedicated rib films to
look for fracture; these were negative.  Due to her clinical
improvement, PE was felt to be less likely and CTA was not
pursued.  Pain was controlled initially with morphine and
oxycodone, and switched to non-narco
