Chief Complaint:
Bright Red Blood Per Rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Needle Thoracentesis
Chest Pigtail Catheter Placement and Removal


History of Present Illness:
65 year old man with CAD (s/p multiple DES, see below, last CC
[**4-15**] s/p LCX (Ultra) and OM1 (BMS), CHF EF 40%, severe COPD on
home O2, kidney stones, ETOH abuse presented to ED for
evaluation of bloody loose stools.
.
He notes that over the past 2 days he developed acute onset
loose stools and malaise. He noted on Sat. night that stools
were bloody. He did not have abdominal cramping or pain, no n/v
or anorexia. No melena. No CP. Given that these symptoms
persistent into sunday, he consulted with a physician covering
the PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] suggested he be evaluated in the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 76 146/74 88% on 6L, s/p Nebs was
94% on 4L. He received combivent x3, 125mg of solumedrol, and
500mg of Azithromycin. Labs were notable for CK 629, MB 29 MBI
4.6 and Troponin of 0.1. Given his "BRBPR" history, pt. was not
stated on heparin gtt. CXR showed unchanged effusion. EKG
notable for TwI II, TwF in III and IVCD with Qw in II, III,
unchanged from prior. He was admitted to cardiology for ROMI and
further evaluation.
.
Of note, patient has had multiple admissions for hypoxemia. This
was felt to be multifactorial (COPD exacerbations vs. effusion
vs. CHF). He had a Right sided pleural effusion chronically,
tapped on [**2107-2-9**], cytology negative, 4+PMN with no growth. Last
fluid total protein 3.5, LDH 130, alb 2.6, PH 7.43. He
apparently had a reaccumulation of the effusion s/p tap. Given
the perisistent hypoxemia during last hospitalization, he was
started on home O2 (ambulatory sat was 83% on room air). He
notes that as he awakens, his Sat is in low 80s and improves to
low 90s after AM inhalers. He uses 2L NC day/night but not
consistently.
.
He endorses DOE and SOB at rest, but only mildly changed over
the past 2 months, states its worse in humid hot weather. He
denies CP, orthopnea, PND or LE edema. Plavix stopped 1 month
ago. per pt. Has had persistent cough, incr. in frequency but
unchanged in sputum character (clear). No recent illnesses. His
wife used to tell him that he snored a good deal and had
episodes of no breathing.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All
of the other review of systems were negative.

CT CHEST [**7-26**]:
1. Chronic moderate non-hemorrhagic right pleural effusion has
grown from
small-to-moderate in volume with attendant progression of
substantial rounded atelectasis in the right middle and lower
lobes. No left pleural effusion, pericardial effusion or ascites
in the upper abdomen.
2. Mild-to-moderate emphysema.
3. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, severe coronary
atherosclerotic
calcification. Probable pulmonary arterial hypertension,
unchanged.
4. Possible thyroiditis and/or hypothyroidism.
.
ECHO with bubble study [**8-2**]:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers; however cannot definitively exclude particularly
since images were suboptimal. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is probably normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-7-26**],
findings are similar.
.
[**8-2**] PCXR:
Moderate to large, non-dependent right pleural effusion has
increased
following removal of right pleural drains. There is no longer a
small
pneumothorax at the base of the right lung. Left lung is clear.
Right lung
is substantially obscured but at least significantly atelectatic
in the lower lobe. Mediastinal widening due to a combination of
lipomatosis and mild adenopathy is unchanged.
.
Lung Biopsy Path:
1.  Right pleural tissue, thoracoscopy (A-C):
Dense fibrous tissue with chronic inflammation and reactive
changes.
2.  Right visceral pleural rind, thoracoscopy (D):
Fibrovascular tissue with acute and chronic inflammation.
3.  Right visceral parietal pleural rind, thoracoscopy (E-G):
Fibroadipose tissue with acute and chronic inflammation.
.
Pleural fluid: 2+ PMNs, no growth on culture (final)
