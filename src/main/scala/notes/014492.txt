.
For the last week, Mr. [**Known lastname 83871**] was feeling 'under the
weather'. His furosemide ran-out 48 hours ago and he had no way
of getting to the pharmacy. Today, at 3 pm he shovelled snow. He
went inside and felt short of breath, gasping for air while
watching television. He went upstairs to bed but could not get
comfortable and was "huffing and puffing." His brother was
concerned and called EMS.
.
By EMS, was tachy to 160s, hypertensive to 190s. Received 325
ASA, 3SL NTG (BP to 140s), 100 mg Lasix. In the ED, patient
started on Nitroglycerin gtt, BP fell from 155/123 to 98/54. His
tmax was 99.4, HR was 150 and later 120 after 5mg Metoprolol IV.
His RR was 28-32 and 99% on Bipap.
.
On review of systems, he is DOE after a flight of stairs or [**3-15**]
mile walk, limited by 'gasping for air' and a tightness across
the upper third of his chest. He sleeps on one pillow without
PND. He has had stable LE edema for a year but his abdomen has
gotten larger for a 'couple weeks'. He eats french fries and
hamburgers at [**Last Name (un) **]. He denies exertional buttock or calf
pain.

STUDIES:
.
CXR ([**2192-1-30**])
FINDINGS: Semi-upright portable AP views of the chest are
obtained. Multiple overlying EKG wires and external pacer wires
are noted. There is cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular
congestion compatible with congestive heart failure. No large
pleural effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure.
.
TTE ([**2192-1-31**])
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50%). There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left
ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular
rhythm/premature beats. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
59 M with hx of CHF, atrial fibrillation, NIDDM and
schizophrenia presents with SOB at rest.
.
# CHF, Predominantly Diastolic with mild systolic dysfunction:
Patient's history of progressive DOE to SOB at rest in the
absence of chest pressure/pain in the setting of severe dietary
indiscretion and missed lasix [**Month/Day/Year 4319**] is strongly suspicious for
CHF exacerbation.  His exam (cardiac wheeze, pulmonary edema)
indicates a predominantly left sided failure.  A history of
depressed EF in [**2184**] indicates a systolic failure. The RVR can
be caused by fluid overload, and diminished filling times can
precipitate the SOB at rest.  Repeat TTE showed low normal EF
(LVEF 50%).  EKG was unremarkable, cardiac enzyme was flat.
Patient was given IV lasix 100mg x 1 on hospital day 1, to which
patient diuresed beautifully. He received intensive, repititious
dietary counselling.  He was discharged home with lasix PO 80mg
[**Hospital1 **], Metoprolol 50 TID, and Lisinopril.
.
# Chronic Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Patient with hx of Afib,
likely related to CHF and enlarged left atrium, but also
possible is OSA, hyperthyroidism or less likely, ischemia.
Patient on metroprolol at home, previously on digoxin.  LA was 5
cm in [**2184**].  Repeat TTE showed [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] axis dimension 5.3 cm,
and four chamber length of 6.8 cm.  Metoprolol was continued.
He was loaded with digoxin (0.5mg + 0.25mg q6 x 2 [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4319**]), then
was started on digoxin 0.125mg daily.  Patient's CHADS2 score is
3, so he should be anticoagulated with coumadin.  However,
patient has a history of "coumadin intolerance".  On discussing
with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] appears that the reason he was not able to
tolerate coumadin was due to ov
