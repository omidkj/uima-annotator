History of Present Illness:
This 67 year old white male with a history of VSD repair in [**2098**]
was admitted with a NSTEMI. About one week ago patient was out
walking his dog at night and felt a pressure in the back of his
head. It went away on its own after about one hour. Over the
next week he had several of these episodes, always associated
with walking. On the morning of admission he woke up with the
pressure and it was much more severe, so he went to his doctor.
 His doctor thought he may have arthritis of his back and got a
spine XR and prescribed Cyclobenzeprine. That night, however,
the patient continued to have the headache and then had pain
radiate down his L arm into his axilla. He went to [**Hospital1 5109**] where he had labs drawn that showed troponin of 5.34
and EKGs that reportedly had no changes from prior but with
baseline RBBB. He was given ASA, Plavix, lovenox, beta blocker,
vicodin, and a liter of NS and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cath.
 On arrival to the ED his vitals were: T:97.7 HR: 100 BP: 123/65
RR: 16 o2sat 96% on 2liters. He received 1mg dilaudid X 2 and
remained chest pain/head pain free.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.

dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient.

size. Focal apical hypokinesis of RV free wall.
AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Focal calcifications in
aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal
calcifications in ascending aorta. No 2D or Doppler evidence of

mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve
chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Normal
tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Mild [1+] TR. Mild

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to extensive apical
hypokinesis, and dyskinesis of the true apex. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an inc
