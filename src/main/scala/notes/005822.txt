He reports he has been feeling nauseated and has been vomiting
for the past 2-3 days, but no associated abdominal pain, fevers,
diarrhea/constipation. Not linked to eating, no recent exotic
foods, no one else in the home is sick. Then began to feel short

nitro gtt and BP improved to 180/139.  CXR showed pulmonary
edema.  Reported no neurologic changes.  CT head negative.  Labs
significant for BUN/Creat 73/12.9, trop 0.09.  He is being

Studies:

[**2174-8-16**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Left
ventricular hypertrophy with slight Q-T interval prolongation.
The precordial voltage appears excessive even for age. There is
non-specific inferior ST-T wave flattening. No previous tracing
available for comparison. Clinical correlation is suggested.

[**2174-8-16**] CXR: Suggestion of pulmonary edema and given
cardiomegaly, cardiogenic etiology is suspected. This is
atypical given patient's age.

[**2174-8-16**] CT Head: 1. No intracranial hemorrhage, as questioned. 2.
Single area of subcortical hypodensity in the high right frontal
region, of indeterminate etiology, could be further evaluated
with MRI as clinically
indiciated. 3. Extraaxial spaces more prominent than expected
for age, with particular prominence of the prepontine cistern,
which could reflect presence of an arachnoid cyst. This may also
be evaluated by non-emergent MRI. 4. Incompletely visualized
diffuse paranasal sinus disease. Clinical
correlation is advised.

Brief Hospital Course:
29 year old male with ESRD on HD, HTN, CHF, and anemia who
presented with 3 days N/V, headache, and BP 200/100 at his
dialysis session.

#. Hypertensive emergency: He presented with extremely high
blood pressure with systolic 200-230 and diastolic 140-150.  The
etiology was felt to be inability to tolerate oral intake to
take his BP meds and nonadherence, as well as insufficient fluid
removal at dialysis.  He was initially given his home
medications and placed on nitroglycerin drip in the ED without
much effect on his BP.  He continued to have a severe headache
and nausea/vomiting.  CT head was negative for acute process and
he had no focal neurologic deficits.  He underwent HD with 4L
removed the night of admission.  He was transitioned from a
nitro drip to a labetalol drip with excellent BP response.  He
was restarted on his home medications although was nonadherent
prior to admission.  He was weaned off the labetalol drip and
was stable on his home regimen.

#. Headache: He presented with a [**7-20**] throbbing headache.  CT
head was normal.  His headache improved after improvement in his
BP and discontinuation of his nitroglycerin drip and felt to be
related to hypertensive emergency.

#. ESRD on HD:  He underwent HD with 4L removed the night of
admission.  His admission weight was up 14kg from his dry weight
of 72kg.  He was continued on his home nephrocaps, phos-lo,
sensipar, and lanthanum.

#. Anxiety: He was very anxious on admission, flailing around
and hyperventilating.  This was felt to be partially related to
pulmonary edema due to volume overload and partially related to
his headache.  He was treated with ativan with good effect.

#. Nausea, vomiting: Felt to most likely be related to his
hypertensive emergency vs volume overload as it improved with HD
and better BP control.

#. Prophylaxis: He was given subcutaneous heparin for
prophylaxis

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Gets hemodialysis T, Th, Sat
- Needs close follow-up for BP control and may need uptitration
of his outpatient antihypertensives and ensurance of adherence.
