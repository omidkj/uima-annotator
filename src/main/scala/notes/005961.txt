History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 89yo M w/ CAD s/p cath in [**2147**] which showed no
obstructive ds, CHF and HTN who presents w/ hypotension and ARF.
 This HPI is obtained from pt and his daughter who were both
noted to be poor historians.  Pt reports having a "cold" with
productive cough for the past 10 days which has become
progressively worse.  Denies any fever, chills, dizziness,
rhinorrhea, N/V or abdominal pain.  Has had sore throat and
diarrhea for approximately 3 days.  He also complains of DOE -
he is no longer able to climb a flight of stairs without resting
and requires 2 pillows for sleeping.  Denies PND, CP,
diaphoresis and does not use supplemental O2 at baseline.  His
daughter has noted confusion that began a few days ago - pt
requesting to see his deceased wife.
.
Daughter brought pt from home to the ED to evaluate his upper
respiratory symptoms.  In the triage area, pt's BP found to be
57/28, HR 85, T 94.9, RR 24, O2 sat 95% RA.  His labs were
notable for normal white count, lactate of 2.1, Cr 3.3, CKMBI
8.1 and TnT of 0.14  Cultures were sent, CXR performed, pt given
2L IVF and treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
presumptive pneumosepsis.  He had a R IJ placed and started on
dopamine for pressure support.  On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his BP
improved to 90s/50s. His blood pressure improved with fluids and
pressors were discontinued, and he was placed on Ceftriaxone,
Azithro, and Flagyl for PNA and for additional anaerobic
coverage.

Pertinent Results:
Labs: please see below
.
Imaging:
CXR: evidence of mild fluid overload
CT head w/o contrast: no evidence of ICH, small air fluid level
in L maxillary airspace
.
TTE [**2157-4-22**] - EF 25-40% Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly
dilated. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include severe septal
hypokinesis and mild to moderate hypokinesis elsewhere (lateral
base contracts best). There is mild global right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 89 y/o male with h/o HTN and hypothyroidism, noted to have
SOB, fatigue, low blood pressure and ARF.
.
Hypotension: his low blood pressure was felt to be secondary to
pneumonia and volume depletion in the setting of infection while
on lasix. After discontinuing his BP meds and giving IVF's his
BP normalized, and his Carvedilol was slowly added back on.
.
Cardiac: he has a known history of PAfib, and appears to have
good rate control on Carvedilol alone. He was continued on an
ASA. After d/w with his outpatient cardiologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], it
appears that he had previously been on Coumadin, but the patient
noted side-effects and no longer wanted to continue Coumadin.
    His has a previous history of CAD, with some elevated
cardiac enzymes in the setting of low blood pressure which were
felt to be demand ischemia. He had refused cardiac cath in the
past, and was continued on ASA and Cardvedilol. His cardiac echo
did show some evidence of global hypokinesis, with an estimated
EF of 35-40%. During his hospital stay he did not require any
further diuresis, but should be restarted on a stable Lasix
regimen upon discharge.
.
ARF: his initial Cr was 3.3 with a normal baseline, which was
felt to be pre-renal.  After IVF hydration his Cr and anion gap
normalized.
.
Agitation: he had some initial agitation in the ICU which was
felt to be seconday to acute infection in the ICU. This
gradually improved with treatment of his underlying medical
illness in the setting of known dementia. He remained stable on
standing Haldol 2mg q6. Consideration may be made at rehab to
change to standing Zyprexa if he continued to remain stable.
.
Hypothroidism: his TSH was on the lower end of normal during his
hospital stay, which can be elevated in times of stress. Given
his history of Afib, his TSH and free T4 should be repeated in
the outpatient setting and Synthroid may be adjusted
accordingly.
