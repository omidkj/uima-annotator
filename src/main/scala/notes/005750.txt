Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
ADMISSION CXR:
Markedly limited study. There are profoundly decreased lung
volumes with suggestion of an acute process in the right mid and
lower lung
possibly pneumonia however the differential diagnosis remains
wide. Question
dilated loops of bowel as well as above.

Provisional Findings Impression: LCpc MON [**2103-1-1**] 5:20 PM
Left upper lobectomy. Bulky mediastinal and right hilar lymph
nodes could be
reactive or neoplastic. Multifocal pneumonia, more marked at the
right lower
lobe, should be followed after treatment in six weeks. 6-mm left
lower lobe
nodule, could be nodular infection, second primary lung cancer,
or metastasis,
should be followed. Small pericardial effusion and small
bilateral pleural
effusions, more marked on the right.


Final Report
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST

REASON FOR EXAM: 54-year-old woman with pneumonia, persistent
hypoxia,
history of lung cancer status post resection, please evaluate
for evidence of
persistent or recurrent lung cancer or post-obstructive
pneumonia.

TECHNIQUE: Chest MDCT was performed following intravenous
Visipaque using 5-
mm and 1-mm axial slice thickness. Coronal and sagittal
reformations were
also obtained.

COMPARISON: No prior study for comparison. Correlation was made
with [**12-31**], [**2102**] chest x-ray.

FINDINGS: Prior left upper lobectomy was performed with adjacent
scarring and
normal-appearing stump.

Multifocal peribronchial ground-glass opacity and consolidation
are associated
with minimal septal thickening suggesting multifocal pneumonia,
more marked in
the right lower lobe. 6-mm left lower lobe nodule (4:127) is
present.

Mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes are significantly
enlarged as follows:
Upper right paratracheal 12 x 20 mm, subcarinal 2.1 cm, right
hilar 16 mm,
right supraclavicular 5 mm, prevascular 8 mm, and paraaortic 6
mm.
Nonhemorrhagic pericardial effusion is small. Bilateral pleural
effusions are
small, more marked on the right. Airways are patent to the
subsegmental
level. This study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation except to
note left renal cyst and incidental splenule. There is no bone
lesion
suspicious for malignancy.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal peribronchial opacities involving all lobes, more
marked in the
right lower lobe, in this patient with prior left upper
lobectomy, suggesting
multifocal pneumonia. However, if the primary lung cancer was a
bronchioalveolar carcinoma, recurrent multifocal
bronchioalveolar carcinoma
cannot be ruled out. Followup after treatment in six weeks by
chest CT is
recommended.
2. Very minimally lobulated 6-mm left lower lobe nodule, which
could be a
nodular focus of pneumonia, second primary lung cancer, or
metastasis, should
be followed at the time of next chest CT.
3. Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, could be
reactive or
neoplastic, should also be followed.
4. Small pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural
effusions, more
marked on the right.



Brief Hospital Course:
# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to community acquired
pneumonia: She presented to OSH with fever, cough, hypoxia, with
RML, RLL infiltrates and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] per family
request.  She was initially admitted to the ICU due to high
oxygen requirement. She was treated with levofloxacin and
ceftriaxone and transferred to the floor.  Her flu swab was
negative, as was urine legionella.   She improved slowly.  Also
treated with prn nebs and supplemental oxygen therapy. She was
trasitioned to CTX/Azithromycin to complete a [**6-24**] day course
respectively for comm. acquired pna.

# Schizophrenia - continued home meds.

CT scan of the chest obtained given hx. lung cancer and severity
of pna.  Results above.  Follow up in 6 months recommended.
