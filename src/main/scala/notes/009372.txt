Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with balloon angioplasty to left main
coronary artery and drug eluting stent placed to the right
coronary artery, [**2181-1-18**]


History of Present Illness:
49 F with CAD s/p CABG and CHF (EF 35-40%) transferred from OSH
for NSTEMI and CHF following a long hospital course. She
presented to OSH on [**2181-1-1**] with cough and fever and was
diagnosed with strep pneuo PNA. She also developed step pneumo
bactermia and originally looked septic. She was treated with
vanc and CTX and seemed to have finished a course. During this
period, she had an NSTEMI and cardiology consultation felt that
this represents demand in the setting of infection. Her
troponins peaked at 3.4.
.
During this hospital course, she also developed other
complications including ARF with a creatinine that peaked at
2.9, now recovered. She also had CHF with elevated BNP and was
diuresed with consideration for ARF. There was also seen by
vascular surgery for her severe PVD. She also had diarrhea and
was treated with Flagyl although multiple cultures have been
cdiff negative. She was also anemic and was tranfused.
.
On review of systems, denies hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**1-/2180**]
EF 35-40%
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed with global hypokinesis (basal to mid lateral wall
moves best) and distal LV/apical akinesis. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-8-21**],
the overall LVEF appears slightly lower.
.
CARDIAC CATH: [**12/2179**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed diffuse 3-vessel
disease. The LMCA had a 60% lesion. The LAD was occluded
proximally. The LCX had diffuse disease with a proximal
occlusion. The RCA was occluded
proximally.
2. Graft angiography revealed an occluded SVG-D1 (previously
stented).
The SVG-OM was known occluded. The SVG-RCA was patent, filling
an RCA
with severe 90% lesions in the PLB unchanged from prior studies.
The
LIMA-LAD was patent and supplied an LAD with diffuse disease.
The
subclavian artery had a origin 70% lesion.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated LVEDP of 25mmHg.
Cardiac
index was low normal at 2.3l/min/m2.
4. Successful stenting of the subclavian artery with a 6.0 stent
post
dilated with a 7.0 stent with no residual stenosis. (See PTA
comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated filling pressures
3. Successful percutaneous intervention of the subclavian
artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 F with CAD s/p CABG and CHF (EF 35-40%) transferred from OSH
with NSTEMI and CHF after a long hospital course.
.
# CAD: The pt's cardiac biomarkers were followed and they
trended down. She underwent cardiac catheterization on the
second hospital day with balloon angioplasty to a stenosis in
the distal LAD and placement of a DES in the SVG-PDA graft. The
patient required propofol sedation during the procedure and was
monitored afterwards overnight in the CCU. She was continued on
her home ASA, Plavix, beta blocker, pravastatin and ACEi. The
patient arrived from the OSH on Coreg; this was continued
instead of metoprolol
.
# Pump. The patient was previously known to have a depressed
LVEF; repeat echo during this admission showed an EF of
approximately 25%. She was felt to be mildly volume up and thus
was gently diuresed. She was continued on her home digoxin
(though this was decreased to every other day dosing), beta
blocker and ACEi. She was started on spironolactone. Based on
her EF assessment, the patient is likely a candidate for ICD
implant in the future.
.
# PVD: The patient was continued ASA and Plavix. She was seen by
vascular surgery who recommended avoiding groin access during
cath. She will follow up in vascular clinic two weeks after
discharge.
.
# ARF: The patient's creatinine reportedly peaked at 2.9 at the
OSH. This renal failure appeared to have fully resolved by the
time she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]. Two days after cath, she again
developed ARF that was felt to be contrast-associated.
Nephrotoxic medications were held and this slowly improved. Peak
Cr at [**Hospital1 18**] was 2.2.
.
# PNA and bacteremia: The patient completed courses of vanc and
ceftriaxone at the OSH. Repeat cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] were negative
and the patient did not have evidence of recurrent infection.
Radiology advised a repeat CXR to evaluate for resolution of PNA
as an outpt.
.
#. SOB: The pt complained of shortness of breath throughout her
hospital stay. This was felt to be primarily due to
