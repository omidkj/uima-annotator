Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
86 year-old female with CAD s/p MI [**7-31**] with unknown type stent
to 80% proximal D1, also with LCx 70% in OM2, ICM (EF 25-30%),
PAF not on coumadin, HTN, presented to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**2103-4-18**]
with new dyspnea/PND.
.
Patient reported acute dyspnea which woke her from sleep. She
reported PND, orthopnea. She denied fever, cough, chills. She
denied chest pain, palpitations. She reported black stools x4-5
months. Has been on ASA/plavix since stent placement in 9/[**2101**].
Had recent cardiology visit where she declined coumadin for new
afib with understanding of increased risk of stroke, MI, heart
failure.
.
At OSH, was found to be guaiac positive with hematocrit 27.4
(per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] for pt with baseline Hct 36), WBC 12.8, troponin I
0.2 (normal <0.1), WBC 12.8, CK 142, BNP 2883. She complained of
fatigue and was given 2 units packed red blood cells. She then
went into flash pulmonary edema. She was started on NTG, Lasix
40mg IV and put on BiPAP. No EKG changes were noted. CXR with
cardiomegaly, decompensated heart failure, and basilar
infiltrates. Patient was unable to be weaned off of BiPAP. She
was given azithromycin, ceftriaxone for ?pneumonia. Also placed
on [**Hospital1 **] PPI for guaiac positive stool. She was subsequently
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on BiPAP.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, 184/99, 90, 22, 98%RA. On arrival, patient was
started on nitroglycerin ggt, propofol ggt. Patient did have BP
200s/120s, RR 40s on BiPAP, temperature 101.4 during ED course.
Given tachypnea, patient was intubated; AC, TV 450, RR 16, FiO2
100%. On exam, she was noted to have crackles with decreased
breath sounds at bases, hematuria, guaiac positive brown stool.
On EKG, she was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with Q waves
in inferior leads without ST elevations. Patient ruled in for
NSTEMI with CK: 1300  MB: 152  MBI: 11.7, troponin T 6.23. Also
had leukocytosis to 16.5, hematocrit 33.2 (up from 27.4 after 2
units pRBCs), creatinine 1.7, lactate 2.4. Seen by cards fellow,
no indication for emergent cath, and heparin not started given
high risk of GIB and hematuria. Blood and urine cultures were
sent. CXR with interstitial edema without infiltrate. Given
hypotension, nitroglycerin was downtitrated and propofol
stopped; fentanyl, midazolam were started.
.
On transfer from ED, 98.1, 64, 139/65, 19, 100%. Patient denies
pain, was comfortable. She is intubated and therefore unable to
participate in full review of systems.


Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes(-), Dyslipidemia(+),
Hypertension(+)
2. CARDIAC HISTORY:
- PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: 80% proximal D1 s/p
unknown stent in [**7-31**]
- CAD s/p MI [**7-31**] with stent placement (80% proximal D1 s/p
stent, LCx 70% in OM2). Presented with weakness, fatigue,
dyspnea, BP 140/80, had new afib
- Ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 25-30% - admitted in [**5-/2099**] for
heart failure
3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Atrial fibrillation; by report, patient previously refused
coumadin
- Dyslipidemia
- History of asymptomatic bradycardia; pacemaker was offered,
patient had declined. Holter in 10/[**2101**].
- Baseline Hct 36.3 in [**7-/2102**]; has not had a colonoscopy
(declined) since [**2089**]
*****Per PCP review of records, had outpatient cards visit [**4-12**], [**2102**]: had conversation with cardiologist where she
understood the risk of not treating the BP (190/84), ECG in afib
- talked about coumadin, understood was increased risk of
stroke, MI, heart failure. Patient was hesitant to take too many
pills but willing increase lisinopril from 10 to 20.*****

Pertinent Results:
[**2103-4-19**] CXR:
Cardiac enlargement including prominence of left atrium and
pulmonary congestion consistent with CHF. No pneumothorax or
acute
parenchymal infiltrates.

[**4-20**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with infero-lateral
hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased
gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade

Brief Hospital Course:
86 year-old female with CAD s/p MI [**7-31**] with BMS to 80% proximal
D1, also with 70% in OM2, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 25-30%),
PAF not on coumadin, hypertension, with NSTEMI not on heparin
gtt due to high risk of GIB. Hospital course was as follows.

1. CORONARIES: Patient ruled in for large NSTEMI with positive
enzymes. CK peaked at 1300. Patient with known CAD with 80%
proximal D1, OM2 70% with stent placement in former in [**2101**]. No
ST elevations on EKG. ST depression V4, <1mm V5-V6 with TWI.
Inciting event for NSTEMI was likely brought on by anemia [**12-25**] GI
bleeding, although given rapid rise and fall of CK, acute
occlusion may be also be possible. Hematocrit was maintained
above 25. Patient was continued on aspirin. Plavix was
discontinued given sufficient course of therapy after placement
of BMS, and given risk of worsened GI bleed. Statin was
continued. Patient was not placed on a beta-blocker given
history of asymptomatic
