Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for HTN, afib, and squamous cell lung CA diagnosed in [**2132-5-1**],
status post right upper lobe lobectomy, who presented to the ED
with c/o left back pain. The patient first reported back pain
starting on [**7-14**], with no radiation, and which came on after
coughing. He has also complains of worsening SOB for the last
few days and increased productive cough.  Denies chest pain,
N/V, F/C.  On arrival to ED, he was afebrile, and vitals were
stable with 97% O2 on 2 L, BP 162/74. In the ED, the patient
went to the restroom and became diaphoretic and hypertensive
upon standing with BP's increased to 206/79. He also had
increased SOB, decreased O2 sats to 73% and was more lethargic;
abg at that time was - 7.23/101/72 (uncertain FiO2). Pt. was
intubated; received nebs, solumedrol 80 IV, levoflox 500 IV x 1
and 10 mg IV hydralazine. CE's were negative x 1, EKG
demonstrated old LBBB, and hct was 26 (baseline 30-31). Initial
CXR demonstrated new bilateral nodular opacities, old R pleural
effusion, and R 5th rib fracture. Repeat CXR following onset of
symptoms demonstrated complete opacification of the R.Lung
field. A 3rd CXR following tx. demonstrated interval resolution
of this opacification. Repeat ABG: 7.34 / 61 / 348. The patient
was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further mangagement.

Past Medical History:
1. Squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post right upper lobe
lobectomy;  On last hospitalization ([**1-4**]) CT and MRI
demonstrated a right skull-base lesion worrisome for metastatic
bone dx, but f/u bone scan did not reveal evidence of metastatic
dx.
2. Seizure- One seizure 15 years ago, previously on
subtherapeutic Dilantin which was discontinued in [**2132-10-1**];
Recent seizure in [**1-4**] for which he was hospitalized and started

40%;
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen therapy
intermittently
5. Hypertension
6. Atrial fibrillation
7. Hypercholesterolemia
8. Osteoarthritis
9. History of lef tibial osteomyelitis

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old male with a PMH significant for HTN, afib, and
squamous cell lung CA , with acute onset respiratory distress in
the EU.  Likely etiologies include obstruction (mucus plugging,
CA), effusion, infection, or pulmonary edema (flash edema).
Given the acute onset and resolution of his opacity by CXR and
acute reversal of CO2 by ABG, an obstructive process, ie mucus
plug, was most likely. He was given IV lasix 80 mg x 1,
Albuterol nebs, Ipratroprium, and intermittent suction. He was
started on Levo/Cipro empirically for pna. He was started on
Solumedrol 80mg IV TID for potential COPD flare. He remained on
ventilatory support secondary to respiratory distress until
health care proxy could be contact[**Name (NI) **] in regard to his desired
level of care. Family and PCP were notified of the patients
status, and the family expressed their wish for his status to be
DNR/DNI, with no aggressive measures. His wife is his health
care proxy and his PCP is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **]. He was extubated on
[**2133-7-16**] and died secondary to respiratory failure the morning of
[**2133-7-16**].
