Chief Complaint:
Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
72 year old male with h/o type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented
with hyperglycemia, hypertension and seizure.  Up until one day
prior to admission, he had been feeling well, then on the day of
admission he noted that his right hand was shaking. That night
he had lethargy, no focal symptoms, just not feeling well and
ate dinner with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] then went to bed. His wife checked
on him at about 21:30 and found him in tonic-clonic seizure.

He was brought to the ED by EMS his VS on arrival were 98.9,
130, 192/122, 17 96%NRB. Got head CT and had another seizure on
the way back from CT.  Glucose was critically high.  He was
given 2mg ativan, 10 units IV insulin, decadron, ceftriaxone,
and vancomycin.  LP was done.  He was also given 2.5 liters of
normal saline.  Neuro saw him and felt his seizures were most
likely secondary to hyperglycemia, but checked LP and there was
no evidence of infection. LFTs normal. Pt. was noted to be
"post-ictal" in the ED, not responding to commands.

On the floor,  he is following commands, but still lethargic and
delerious.

      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
   FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2150-9-1**]):    NO GROWTH.

IMAGING:
[**2150-8-28**] CT head: No acute hemmorhage. MRI is more senitive for
acute ishemia.

[**2150-8-29**] CXR: Mild volume overload

EEG: This is a mildly abnormal extended routine EEG due to low
voltage of the background rhythm with diffuse beta activity.
There were
no focal, lateralized, or epileptiform features noted.

EKG:  Sinus tachycardia, rate 127. There are slight non-specific
ST-T wave changes in leads I, II, aVF and leads V4-V6. Consider
left atrial abnormality. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2149-3-22**], except for the change in rate, no other diagnostic
interval change.

MRI/MRA Brain:
1. Motion-limited head MRI and MRA.
2. No acute infarction. New chronic microvascular infarcts since
[**2142**].
3. Unremarkable head MRA.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old male with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus who
presented with hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypertension and
seizures.  He was originally admitted to the MICU and once
stabilized, was transferred to the floor.

# Seizures: He presented with two seizures in the setting of
severe hyperglycemia.  He had a lumbar puncture and his CSF did
not suggest meningitis or encephalitis.  His tox screen was
negative.  His seizures could also have been secondary to
hyperosmolality due to both hyperglycemia and hypernatremia.  He
had altered mental status after his seizures which cleared prior
to discharge.  He had an MRI with no acute changes (although it
did show chronic microvascular infarcts).  He also had an EEG
that showed no epileptiform activity.  Neurology followed the
patient while he was in the hospital, and recommended to start
dilantin if he were to have another seizure in the future.  The
patient was advised not to drive for 6 months.  He is scheduled
for outpatient follow-up in epilepsy clinic.

# Hyperglycemia: On admission, his blood sugars were so high
they could not be measured.  He was initially on an insulin drip
and then rapidly switched to NPH and sliding scale insulin.  His
blood sugars remained slightly labile during the rest of his
admission, and he was transitioned back to his home regimen.  It
is not clear what incited this hyperglycemic episode, as he
reports no history of medication or diet changes, recent
insomnia, or recent illness.  On discharge, he was instructed to
keep a blood sugar diary and check his blood sugars at least
three times daily.

# Hypertension: Upon arrival to the ICU, he had hypertension
with systolic blood pressures in the 190-200's.  Quickly after
admission, his hypertension resolved and he was restarted on his
home medications.  He had one episode of relative hypotension
with BP of 100/60 after receiving his morning medications.
Therefore, his clonidine was switched to an evening medication.
He was continued on minoxidil, valsartan, and metoprolol at his
home dosing regimens.

#. Hypernatremia: He was hypernatremic on admission and for a
2-3 days after admission with a serum Na of 145-147.  This was
likely caused by osmotic diuresis from his hyperglycemia.  Also
there was likely some contribution by impaired access to free
water with change in mental status.  Seizures can also cause
intracelluluar osmole generation and transient hypernatremia.
Free water intake was encouraged and his sodium level returned
to normal range by the time of discharge.

#. Diastolic CHF: He has a history of diastolic heart failure
but was thought to be volume depleted on admission.  His
torsemide was held throughout the hospitalization and at
discharge.

#. Chronic renal insufficiency: He has a baseline creatinine of
about 2.1 (although fluctuates substantially) and his creatinine
was elevated on admission to 2.8.  His urine electrolytes were
consistent with a prerenal etiology and his creatinine came back
to baseline with rehydration.

#. Gout: His allopurinol was initially held due to concern for
worsening renal failure, but he was started back on his home
dose at discharge.

#. Prophylaxis: He was given subcutaneous heparin for DVT
prophylaxis

#. Code Status: He was full code during this hospitalization
