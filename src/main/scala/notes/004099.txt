History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 10840**] is a pleasant 83 year old female, followed by
biliary service at [**Hospital1 18**] for biliary obstruction status-post
stenting for likely malignancy, though not biopsy proven, as
well as a history of cholangitis. She was at home with her
husband, who noted on morning of admission she was much less
responsive than usual, and that she felt warm to the touch. He
describes that she was slightly more somnolent the day prior to
admission. He was concerned and called EMS. She was brought to
[**Hospital3 3583**]. There, she was noted to have a white blood cell
count of 26 with bands, a total bilirubin of 2.4, no acute chest
process on chest x-ray, and a mildly positive urine analysis
with 1+ LE. She was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl
over concern of cholangitis. Her INR was over 8, and she was
given 10 mg of intravenous vitamin K. Blood and urine cultures
were drawn prior to administration of antibiotics. She was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] abdominal ultrasound was completed, which
demonstrated no change in known intrahepatic dilatation, two
common bile duct stents in place, and no obvious abscesses. Her
vitals at that time were: temperature of 101.4 rectal, stable
blood pressure (never hypotensive, lowest 120/40) 160/70, RR 24,
Sat 98% on NRB. She was noted to be rigoring and was somnolent
but somewhat arousable. Her laboratories were notable for a
transaminitis AST >ALT, lactate 2.4, INR 7.7. She received more
vitamin K, was seen by surgery and was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for plan
to ERCP in AM.
.
Of note, patient had recent admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for polymicrobial
sepsis in setting of biliary stent obstruction due to tumor. She
underwent ERCP with successful flushing of stents. Her course
was complicated by afib with RVR, DVT and liver abscesses not
amenable to drainage.
.
Blood cultures at that time grew:  enterococcus sensitive to
gent and streptomycin; E.coli sensitive to gent, imipenem, and
cephalosporins; Klebsiella pansensitive except to amp.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she would open her eyes to tactile
stimuli and would squeeze her hand when ask; she was not
otherwise interactive.


Past Medical History:
Biliary obstruction/malignant stricture s/p ERCP X 2 and 2 metal
stents--last placed in [**9-12**]. Thought to be cholangiocarcinoma,
no clear pathologic diagnosis made. By report, evaluated by
surgical team, thought not to be a surgical candidate.  Now with
peritoneal carcinomatosis.
-Diabetes mellitus, type 2
-Hypertension
-Coronary artery disease
-Parkinson's disease
-diastolic CHF
-Vaginal Carcinoma
-s/p Cholecystectomy
-Urosepsis d/t E. coli and Proteus
-Bacteremia due to VRE in [**9-12**] treated with 2 week course of
Linezolid
-Bacteremia due to E. coli in [**9-12**] treated with 2 week course of
Ceftriaxone.
-Atrial fibrillation
-Hyperlipidemia


Social History:
She lives with husband in [**Name (NI) 3320**], and has no children.
Dependent for ADLs--has VNA and husband cares for her, no
tobacco or drugs, occassional alcohol. Retired tax examiner for
the state.
At baseline, she eats pureed foods with some assistance from her
husband depending on how bad her Parkinsons tremor is. Her
primary care physician describes she has a good baseline quality
of life.

Family History:
Per records, her mother died of heart disease.

Physical Exam:
On Admission:
T= 101.9 axillary BP=125/59 HR=103 RR=? O2= 100% on 50% shovel
mask
Gen: elderly female, very warm, somnolent but follows with eyes.

HEENT: Dry mucous membranes, OP clear
Neck: No JVP
Car: Tachycardic, irregular, no murmurs appreciated
Resp: course BS bilaterally transmitted from O2.
Abd: soft, +BS, ND, unclear if tenderness pain in [**Name (NI) 25714**] - pt opens
eyes wide.
Ext: strong distal pulses, bilateral edema
Neuro: somnolent, unable to participate in neuro exam.
Skin: No rashes or lesions noted

Pertinent Results:
Ultrasound:
IMPRESSION:
1. No significant interval change in intrahepatic biliary duct
dilatation,
most severe within the left lobe.
2. Echogenic material within both common bile duct stents is
nonspecific, and
could represent debris, but tumor involvement is not excluded.
3. Patent main portal vein, however, the patient's known right
posterior
portal venous branch occlusion is not visualized on current
examination.
4. Small amount of perihepatic fluid.
5. 1.1-cm pancreatic mid body lesion, stable from the prior
studies.
6. No new hepatic abscess identified.

Chest x-ray:
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. Patchy opacity
within the
retrocardiac region is felt to represent atelectasis and/or
scarring.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 10840**] is an 83 year old female with history of biliary
obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia from cholantitis
presenting with fever, altered mental status concerning for
ascending cholangitis.

#. Sepsis: Pt presented with altered mental status, fevers,
tachycardia and leukocytosis. Symptoms were presumed to be due
to cholangitis and obstruction of known biliary stent, given
elevated white blood cell count, fevers, and elevated liver
function tests. There were no other clear sources of infection
on admission. A RUQ ultrasound showed no change in biliary
dilitation but ERCP showed sludge and stones obstructing the
stent which were successfully cleared out. Pt was initially
empirically treated linezolid, ceftriaxone and flagyl given
prior h/o VRE and resistent bacteria, and transitioned to only
high dose ceftriaxone once blood cultures grew Klebsiella. She
was also treated with IVF boluses via PICC and did not require a
CVL or pressors. The biliary surgery and ERCP team followed
along during her stay. The infectious disease team helped guide
appropriate antibiotic choice: as she did not have evidence of
active hepatic abscesses on abdominal CT, a 2 week course was
deemed sufficient (last day [**3-28**]). Her mental status returned to
baseline, and her fevers resolved within a few days of
hospitalization. Her blood cutlures checked after the initial
positive results remained sterile.

#. Coagulopathy: On presentation pt's INR was 8, likely in
setting of poor hepatic clearance of coumadin. She had no signs
of active bleeding. She recieved several doses of Vitamin K and
FFP to reverse her INR for ERCP and was NOT restarted on
anticoagulation post procedure, out of concern for needing
future procedures. Benefits and downsides of anticoagulation can
be discussed with pt's PCP given ongoing goals of care.

#. [**Name (NI) 20472**] Pt's home home glyburide was held and pt was
monitored and treated with a sliding scale of insulin. This was
not restarted after her procedures due to generally good blood
sugar control; however, this can be restarted when necessary at
rehab depending on her blood sugars.

#. Coronary artery disease: Patient's last echo was in [**Month (only) 404**]
[**2169**], which demonstrated an EF of >55%, normal systolic
function, mild MR. She was continued on her home statin, while
her home anti-hypertensives were initially held in the setting
of concern of hypotension while septic. Her metoprolol was
started after her BP recovered.

#. Atrial fibrillation: Pt supratherpeutic on coumadin on
arrival. This was not restarted due to ongoing discussions about
goals of care. Metoprolol was restarted and titrated up to 50mg
tid given episodes of afib with RVR in the ICU. This was backed
down to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] after she was noted to be in sinus brady in the
50s on the floor. Digoxin was not restarted.

#. HTN: held home BP regimen on admission. Metoprolol was added
back as above and lisinopril and HCTZ were added and titrated up
after she became h
