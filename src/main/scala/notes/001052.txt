1. Left pneumothorax.
2. Right subclavian central venous line with tip in the expected
region of the right atrium. For optimal positioning the tip may
be withdrawn approximately 3 cm.
3. Endotracheal tube is well positioned.
4. Nasogastric tube should be advanced approximately 5 cm for
optimal positioning.

The left chest tube was removed. The left subcutaneous emphysema
is slightly decreased in size but still present. No evidence of
pneumothorax is demonstrated. Bibasal atelectases are again
noted as well as a right pleural effusion. The left central
venous line tip terminates at the junction of brachiocephalic
vein and SVC. No evidence of congestive heart failure is
present.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient tolerated the initial surgery (EBL 150cc) and was
taken to the PACU. In the PACU, she became unresponsive and
hypotensive. She was subsequently intubated without sedation and
a code blue was called; a femoral a line and right subclavian
triple lumen were placed (after failed attempt at left
subclavian and right IJ complicated by arterial puncture). Per
nursing there was a brief episode of ? PEA/Asystole, but once
the MICU code team responded they noted a DP/femoral pulses. She
was responsive and following commands (squeezed hand to
command). There was attempted resuscitation in the PACU for one
hour after which the patient was taken to the OR for exploration
as her blood pressure remained labile despite tansfusion of 4
units. Of note, the patient was able to move all limbs during
this time and the patient seemed to respond to her family prior
to returning to the OR.

In the OR, the patient was found to be bleeding from the the
renal left renal artery into her RP. Her retroperitoneum was
evacuated and the bleeding site was oversewn.  Assistance was
provided by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] of Transplant Surgery. The patient had
strong pulses and stable vitals throughout the procedure. She
was given 2gm cefazolin periop.

In sum, the estimated blood loss was -2.5 L. She received 2.7L
of PBRC (~ 18 U), many of which were not cross-matched ([**9-26**])-pt
has autoantibodies: anti-[**Doctor Last Name **], anti-JKa. She also received 8 [**Location 97341**] and 3L of LR.

Postoperatively she was transferred to the MICU for further
management including central monitoring, delayed extubation, and
transient requirement for neosynephrine. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient
was noted to have a left pneumothorax and required Gen [**Doctor First Name **] to
place a chest tube on POD #0.  During the several days in the
ICU, pt required fluid management with hydration and lasix,
respiratory support with intubation until POD2 and O2
supplementation until leaving the ICU.

Once transfered to Urology, the patient required a PT consult
[**2-17**] difficulty ambulating and a nutrition consult [**2-17**] decreased
po intake.

Upon discharge, pt afebrile with vital signs stable.  Pt going
to rehab center for PT.  Pt tolerating po feeds and requires
supplements that she normally takes as an outpatient.  Pt pain
controlled with po pain meds.
