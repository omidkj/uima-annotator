History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 24481**] is an Italian-speaking 65 yo male with HTN and
50+ pack-year smoking history who has not been seen by a
physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 1.5 years, presented to the ED with 1 day of SOB,
diaphoresis and CP. He began to feel diaphoretic and short of
breath while at work as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. When the symptoms did not
resolve with rest, he left work early and went home. There, he
describes feeling CP that he describes as "squeezing," [**8-13**],
non-radiating and not relieved with rest, which led him to take
an ambulance to the ED.
He reports frequent SOB and occasional CP on exertion at
baseline for at least the past year, which he says normally
resolves with rest, although he does endorse occasional SOB at
rest. He attributes these symptoms to his age and smoking. He
also notes a chronic cough over the past year, which he
attributes to his smoking, and denies any recent worsening of
the cough.
EKG showed inferior Q waves, TWI and ST depressions. CXR showed
pulmonary edema anmd and CEs were elevated with troponin 3.13.
He was loaded with plavix 600mg, received one full dose ASA and
started on heparin gtt.
He was sent to the cath lab for angiography which showed severe
LM/3VD. A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed and showed low cardiac
index (1.4). A TTE was performed in the cath lab which revealed
inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis, normal RV function,
significant AS, 4+ MR, 3+TR, LVEF 35% and moderate pulmonary
HTN. An IABP was placed. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was consulted for coronary
revascularization and valvular replacement.

GENERAL: WDWN Male in NAD. Oriented x3. Mood, affect
appropriate.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

NECK: Supple with 5cm JVP, but with bed flat due to IABP.
CARDIAC: RR, with mechanical sounds.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp
were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. CTAB anteriorly, no
crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. +BS.
EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES:
Right: Carotid 2+ PT 2+ DP by doppler
Left: Carotid 2+ PT 2+ DP by doppler

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2184-7-28**]: Single AP chest radiograph without comparison shows
moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. The heart size is
probably top normal. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural
effusions.
IMPRESSION: Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
.
EKG [**2184-7-28**], 10:48:24: sinus tachycardia at 110 bpm with some
LAD, normal intervals, notable for Q waves in II, III, aVF; deep
TWI in II, III, aVF; 1mm STD in I, aVL.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
inferior and inferoseptal walls. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 35 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Significant aortic stenosis is present
(not quantified - ? Mild-moderate)). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation. If clinically indicated, a TEE
would be able to better identify a potential mechanical problem
with the mitral valve (I.e., flail leaflet or partial papillary
muscle rupture as the cause of the mitral regurgitation).

CAROTID U/S ([**7-29**]): Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.

Brief Hospital Course:
65yo Italian-speaking male was taken to the operating room and
underwent AVR(#21mm CE Magna)/MVR(#29mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic)/TV repair
(#28mm CE MC3ring)/Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting x 4(Left
internal mammary artery grafted to left anterior
descending/Saphenous vein grafted to Diag/OM2/PDA)-[**2184-8-2**].
Cross clamp time= 192 minutes. Cardiopulmonary bypass time=230
minutes. Please refer to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) 5305**] operative report for
further details. He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CVICU in critical but stable condition
requiring multiple pressors and Milrinone to optimize cardiac
output.The intra-aortic balloon pump, placed preop, was
discontinued on POD#1.He awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated on POD#2. Drips were weaned off. Lines and tubes were
discontinued in a timely fashion.Beta-blocker and diuresis was
initiated. He continued to progress and was transferred to the
step down unit for further monitoring on POD#5. Dental was
consulted regarding Mr.[**Known lastname 24482**] ill-maintained lower teeth.
Amoxicillin was empirically initiated and recommended to
continue until  dental extraction is completed as an outpatient.
Coumadin was started for low dose anticoagulation secondary to
the double tissue valves and tricupsid ring. On day of
discharge, Coumadin was held and the patient's daughter was
instructed that Mr.[**Known lastname 24481**] should hold off taking Coumadin
until the dental procedure is complete. Once Coumadin is
restarted, it is to be continued for 2 months. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **],
Cardiology, will follow the INR/Coumadin dosing. The remainder
of his postoperative course was essentially uneventful. On POD#
8, Mr.[**Known lastname 24481**] was cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for discharge to home
with VNA. All follow up appointments were advised.
