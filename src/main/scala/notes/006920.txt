CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 75 year old
male with multiple medical problems who was recently admitted
in [**2111-4-4**], to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for lobar
pneumonia, who presents to the Emergency Department with
acute shortness of breath.  The patient was admitted at the
end of [**Month (only) 956**] with ischemic cerebrovascular accident which
was consistent followed by pneumonia.  Sputum grew out E.
coli and Pseudomonas.  The patient was subsequently treated
for these infections and discharged to rehabilitation with a
14 day course of Ceftazidine.  The patient did well and was
sent home on Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation and
cerebrovascular accident.  The Coumadin was discontinued
approximately one week ago and substituted with aspirin.

A follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram did not reveal
intra-cardiac thrombus.

The morning of admission, at approximately 5 a.m., the
patient acutely sat up in bed with sudden shortness of
breath.  This improved with sitting up and upon arriving to
the Emergency Department the patient received Solu-Medrol 125
mg, Lasix 100 mg, morphine 2 mg, Levaquin 500 mg, Vancomycin
one gram and Ceftazidime one gram intravenously.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in [**2100**].
2.  Chronic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Atrial fibrillation with transesophageal echocardiogram
negative for thrombus on [**2111-4-3**].
4.  The patient is status post cerebrovascular accident which
was in the right paraventricular area.
5.  History of coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction times two; the last myocardial infarction in [**2106**].
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Colon cancer in [**2096**], status post colectomy with ostomy.
8.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm in [**2110-8-4**] which was
measured to be 4.8 by 4.8 centimeters.
9.  Congestive heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction.
10. Peptic ulcer disease.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient has a 100 pack year history of
smoking with occasional alcohol use.  He lives with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, vital signs were
temperature 97.9 F.; blood pressure 193/86 which rapidly
decreased to 137/69 in the Emergency Department; heart rate
of 110; respiratory rate 30; and the patient was saturating
94% on 100% nonrebreather and 98% on Bi-PAP with 100% FIO2.
General appearance is an elderly male in acute distress.
HEENT:  Extraocular muscles are intact; question of icterus.
Oropharynx with no hemorrhages.  Neck:  Cannot assess jugular
venous distention given respiratory distress and retractions.
Pulmonary:  Left coarse rales throughout without wheezes.
Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Good bowel sounds.  Extremities with two plus
edema, right greater than left.

LABORATORY:  On admission included white blood cell count
27.4, hemoglobin 9.9, hematocrit 32.9, platelets 134.  Chem 7
with sodium of 137, potassium 4.3, chloride 99, bicarbonate
26, BUN 28, creatinine 1.4 and glucose 121.

A chest x-ray was performed which showed left lower lobe
consolidation.

An electrocardiogram was performed which showed sinus
tachycardia with poor R wave progression and no Q waves but
ST depressions in leads I, II, V4 through V6.

Given the above the patient was sent for CT angiogram to rule
out pulmonary embolism.  While in the CT scanner, the patient
had increasing respiratory distress and was intubated. The
patient was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit where he arrived at approximately 12:10 p.m.

The patient's family at this time was reconsidering the
patient's code status.  While these decisions were being
made, the patient began to become more hypoxemic with
decreasing blood pressure, decreasing heart rate and bleeding
through his endotracheal tube.

The family decided that the aggressive nature of the
interventions required to sustain Mr. [**Known lastname 34143**] life exceeded
what he would want done.  Therefore, they requested that he be
made comfort measures only.  Mr. [**Known lastname 1637**] was given morphine
for pain control and subsequently died at 12:30 p.m.

He had no spontaneous respirations, no heart rate, no
response to painful stimuli and his pupils were unresponsive
to light.

The presumed cause of death was respiratory failure due
to combination of pulmonary hemorrhage and pneumonia which were
both evidenced on his CT angiogram
that had since been performed.

This was discussed with the patient's family and with his
primary care physician.
