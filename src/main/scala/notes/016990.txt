Admission Date:  [**2199-12-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2200-1-9**]


Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old gentleman
with a past history significant for hypertension, diabetes,
and hyperlipidemia who was in his usual state of health until
approximately one week prior to admission when he began
having vague systemic symptoms of malaise.

On the day prior to admission he began feeling the acute
onset of shortness of breath and chest "pressure" which was
nonradiating.  He took one sublingual nitroglycerin which
resolved the symptoms.  After a period of time he had a
recurrence of symptoms, this time associated with
diaphoresis.  For this, he took two sublingual nitroglycerin
and only had minimal improvement.  He came to [**Hospital1 346**] after these symptoms did not
improve.

In the Emergency Department he was given nitroglycerin paste,
aspirin, Lopressor and admitted to the Medicine Service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes times 20 years.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
4.  Obstructive sleep apnea (on CPAP).
5.  Status post cholecystectomy complicated by "sepsis."
6.  History of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma, both
resected.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Labetalol 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Accupril 40 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.,
nifedipine 90 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 30 mg p.o. q.p.m.,
glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 5 mg p.o. q.p.m.,
Glucophage 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., NPH Humulin 7 units
at 10 p.m., Lente 10 units at noon.

ALLERGIES:  LEVAQUIN causes a rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  History of tobacco abuse; quit many years
ago.  Rare ethanol use.  The patient is retired and lives
with his wife.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father had a history of
coronary artery disease, and his mother had a history of
hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission
temperature was 99.3, pulse 94, blood pressure 186/81,
respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 89% to 90% on room air
which improved to 97% on nonrebreather.  General impression
revealed a well-dressed, well-nourished, adult male in no
apparent distress.  Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat
revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.  Sclerae were
anicteric.  Extraocular muscles were intact.  Pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  The oropharynx was
clear without lesions, moist mucous membranes.  Neck was
supple.  Difficult to assess jugular venous distention due to
increased neck size.  Chest revealed rales in the lower
one-third of both lung fields.  Cardiovascular had a regular
rate and rhythm, a [**3-19**] to 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the
sternal border.  Abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and
nondistended, without masses.  Guaiac-negative.  Extremities
revealed 2+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally.  No
clubbing or cyanosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] Medicine Service to rule out
myocardial infarction.

Over the next day the patient developed fevers, and a
urinalysis was sent.  The urinalysis revealed an Escherichia
coli urinary tract infection for which the patient was
treated with ceftriaxone.  The patient was treated with this
drug because the patient was allergic to fluoroquinolones.

On hospital day three the patient ruled out for myocardial
infarction by serial enzymes.  On [**12-30**], on hospital
day four, the patient had an echocardiogram which had left
ventricular dilatation, mild lateral and inferolateral
perfusion defects, most reversible.  The ejection fraction
was calculated to be 55%.

Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**2200-1-1**].
The delay in cardiac catheterization was due to awaiting the
patient to become afebrile.  Cardiac catheterization revealed
mild luminal irregularities in the middle cerebral artery.
There was 90% ostial stenosis in the left anterior descending
artery.  Left circumflex with serial 80% lesions.  Right
coronary artery had mild luminal irregularities throughout.
The patient was referred to Cardiac Surgery for coronary
artery bypass graft.

On [**2200-1-3**], the patient went to the operating room
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] who performed a coronary artery bypass
graft to two vessels with left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal.  Please see previously dictated Operative
Note for more details.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transported to the Cardiac Surgical Recovery
Room.  The patient was intubated for the transfer and was
only on an insulin drip when leaving the operating room.

The patient was extubated during the night of his operation
and was weaned off his insulin and nitroglycerin drips.  By
the end of postoperative day one the patient was transferred
to the patient care floor.

On postoperative day two, the patient spiked a fever to 101.6
degrees.  Urinalysis, complete blood count, blood, urine, and
sputum cultures were sent as well as a chest x-ray was taken.
The only abnormality found from this was a urinary tract
infection for which the patient was treated with Bactrim.
The Bactrim was chosen because the patient was allergic to
fluoroquinolones.

On postoperative day two, the patient went into atrial
fibrillation.  There was no rapid ventricular response, and
the patient remained stable.  The patient was loaded with
amiodarone three 150-mg boluses, placed on p.o. amiodarone,
and was continued on his dose of Lopressor.  After some time,
the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm.  The patient
remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the
hospitalization.  The patient was continued on amiodarone,
initially at 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. which was decreased to 40 mg
p.o. q.d. because a QTc interval was noted to be elongated.

In addition to the previously mentioned complications, the
patient's blood sugar remained difficult to control during
this hospitalization, and the [**Hospital **] Clinic was consulted for
assistance with glucose control.  The [**Hospital **] Clinic
eventually was able to control using a combination of Lente,
glyburide, and regular insulin sliding-scale calibrated for
breakfast, lunch, dinner, and hour of sleep doses.

The patient continued to work with physical therapy, and by
postoperative day five he was ambulating at a level V.  By
this time, the patient's pacer wire was removed, the chest
tube was removed, the Foley was removed and he was able to
void and was eating without problems.

On postoperative day six, the patient was able to ambulate to
level V and was cleared by Physical Therapy to go home, and
in fact was discharged to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6354**] in
three weeks.  The patient was to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in three to
four weeks.  The patient was to follow up with the [**Hospital **]
Clinic; he was instructed to call for an appointment.
