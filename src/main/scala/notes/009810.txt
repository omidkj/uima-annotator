Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
 56 yo male with pmhx significant for MDS, has been on Revlimid,
who was referred to the ED for rule out pulmonary embolism after
complaining of acute on chronic dypsnea and being found to be in
afib with RVR while in the hematology/oncology office afternoon
of admission.
.
Patient states that he was found to be in afib about 10 days ago
while having blood transfusion. Denies any associated chest
pain, has had progressive dyspnea for the past two weeks. States
that his dyspnea usually improves following a blood transfusion,
however, last transfusion was Wednesday without significant
improvement. Also notes a chronic cough for the past few months,
non-productive. Denies any recent fevers or chills, no sick
contacts, no recent travel. Has not been treated with any
antibiotics other than his Bactrim prophylaxis. Of note, his
prednisone was recently increased from 10 to 20 mg 3 weeks ago.
On further ROS he denies orthopnea, no PND. Denies LE edema, has
noticed increased DOE with a decrease in exercise tolerance.
States today he could only walk 20 feet before becoming SOB,
able to hike with his daughters one month ago, but notes stairs/
vertical climb has been difficult for a few months. All other
ROS negative. pt also states that he may have had afib in [**2180**]
that was treated with medicine and it resolved. he states having
had multiple cardiac work ups in the past including stress mibi
that were all negative.
.
In the ED the patient was given 20 mg IV diltiazem x 2 with
temporary effect and was then started on a dilt drip. He
underwent a chest CTA, preliminary read shows no PE, and was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management. In the [**Name (NI) 153**] pt was
switched from dilt drip to po dilt. his heart rate has since
been in the 80-100s. he denies any chest pain/sob/orthpnea.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 48168**] is a 56 year old with myelofibrosis who presented
with acute on chronic dyspnea and relatively new-onset atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
With this shortness of breath and a.fib, and concern for his
cardiac well-being and hemodynamic stability, he was admitted on
the [**2187-6-27**]. In the ED he had ruled out for PE by
CTA, although CT did show findings consistent with congestive
heart failure. Cardiac enzymes were negative and TSH and T4 were
within normal limits. He was transferred from the ED to the
[**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU on the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for rate control and cardiac
monitoring. He was started on a diltiazem drip which was
effective in reducing his rate somewhat. He got an
echocardiogram; in summary it showed global wall motion
abnormality and reduced ejection fraction of 30-35%.
.
He was transferred to the BMT service on the night of [**6-28**] once
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team was able to transition his diltiazem drip to PO
diltiazem, 90 mg QID. He remained short of breath and had an 02
sat of 98% on 4L. His heart rates remained above 100 at this
time.
.
Given that he seemed to have a CHF component he had been started
on captopril 6.25 mg. He was also given lasix as aggressively as
his often-low blood pressures would tolerate. He was started on
metoprolol 12.5 mg po BID. On [**2187-7-1**] after some success in
diuresis, he was started on lasix 60 mg PO BID, but this was not
uncommonly held for low blood pressures over the next few days.
.
Cardiology was consulted on [**2187-7-2**]. Their overall
recommendation was to attempt to increase metoprolol and
continue diuresis while titrating down diltiazem dose, as
diltiazem was less likely to have a direct benefit for the heart
failure element of his cardiac picture. The team worked on this
plan, titrating metoprolol up to 12.5 TID and then to 25 [**Hospital1 **],
while holding off on rhythm control because of potential dual
benefit of beta-blocker for rate control and heart failure.
However, this failed to get Mr [**Known lastname 48169**] heart rate
well-controlled, although it declined from its peaks earlier in
the admission.
.
On [**2187-7-5**], as rates remained in the 100s with occasional spikes
up to the 150s, team and cardiology agreed on a plan to start
digoxin. He was loaded with two doses of 0.25 mg and rate
improved; he was put on a standing dose of 0.125 mg with levels
checked. His rates and his clinical well-being both improved
with this. Because his pressures were often low we began holding
diuresis during this same period, d/c'ing the standing
furosemide and following ins and outs and daily weights with a
goal of running approximately even. Chest x-rays showed steady
improvement in pulmonary edema.
.
We did not anticoagulate Mr [**Known lastname 48168**], after discussing with him
the relative risks of splenic injury while anticoagulated versus
the ongoing risk of embolic stroke as a result of atrial
fibrillation. He did take aspirin during much of the admission.
Cardiology suggested the possibility of TEE and cardioversion as
a later consideration; this was deferred during this admission,
again because of concerns about anticoagulation.
.
We were not able to conclusively determine the origins of Mr
[**Known lastname 48169**] cardiac issues. For a conclusive diagnosis of his
cardiomyopathy, a biopsy of cardiac muscle would be required; we
judged this to be too invasive and risky a procedure for its
potential benefits at this point in his course, and treated his
symptoms. We considered viral causes but his history was not
easily consistent with this explanation; most such viral sources
would again only be able to be conclusively diagnosed by tissue,
and it was not clear how we might intervene even in the event of
a positive tissue diagn
