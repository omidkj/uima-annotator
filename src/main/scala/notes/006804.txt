Pertinent Results:
CTA chest [**2158-10-15**]
FINDINGS: Patient is intubated with the endotracheal tube ending
3.4 cm above the carina. There is no aortic dissection or
evidence of pulmonary embolism. The ascending aorta is enlarged
measuring up to 5.1 cm in diameter. The main pulmonary artery is
also prominent, measuring up to 4.4 cm in diameter. There is
moderate cardiomegaly. Fat density is noted within the
interatrial septum, most likely due to lipomatous hypertrophy.
Patient is status post left upper lobectomy. Suture material is
noted at the left hilum. There are dense calcifications also
noted at the left lung base along the diaphragm, likely related
to prior surgery. There is minimal atelectasis in the remaining
left lobe. A 2-mm pulmonary nodule is noted within the right
middle lobe. Dependent atelectasis is noted posteriorly in the
right. There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
lymphadenopathy. Visualized aspects of the upper abdomen
demonstrate diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. Remainder
of the visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning osseous lesions are identified. Mild

degenerative changes are noted throughout the visualized spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. Prominent
ascending aorta
measuring up to 5.1 cm. Prominent main pulmonary artery
measuring up to 4.4 cm, suggesting pulmonary hypertension.
2. 2-3 mm nodule in right middle lobe for which no follow up is
needed if low risk (no underlying malignancy or smoking). If
not, recommend follow up CT in 12 months.
3. Cardiomegaly.
4. Status post left upper lobectomy.
5. Diffuse fatty deposition in the liver.
.
Echo [**2158-10-16**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ?40 %). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal.Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with mild global hypokinesis c/w diffuse
process (toxin, metabolic, tachycardia, etc. - cannot excluded
multivessel CAD). Dilated ascending aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
51yo M with h/o DM and AF on coumadin presenting with AMS found
to have HONC and RAF admitted to ICU for insulin gtt.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated [**3-21**] AMS to protect
airway. CXR revealed widened mediastinum and likely CHF although
cannot r/o MF PNA.  CT done and showed lobectomy and RLL
pneumonia.  Given concern for CAP vs. aspiration PNA, treated
with CTX/azithro/flagyl.  Patient's MS improved and was able to
be extubated on HD 2.  Flagyl was d/c's on day [**5-24**] of treatment
due to small likelihood this was aspiration.  Completed 6 days
of treatment with CTX and azithromycin.  The patient will finish
a full 7 day course with po levofloxacin following discharge.
.
# HONK / Diabetes Mellitus: Patient has no known h/o DM but FSBS
in 800s at OSH with neurologic and electrolyte abnormalities
consistent with HHS. Unclear etiology of this although may be
first presentation of his DM2. Insulin gtt was started,
electrolytes monitored and repleted.  Patient never developed an
anion gap. gtt discontinued on [**10-17**] and pt started on insulin
sliding scale.  HbA1C was 11.9% for an estimaged average glucose
of 295.  Discharged on metformin, lantus, and humalog sliding
scale with sugars well controlled from 150s - 220s.  Will have
VNA for diabetes / finger stick and insulin administration
teaching.
.
# Demand ischemia: Patient has elevated trop with lateral ST
changes on EKG and no prior to compare with but in setting of AF
with RVR so more likely demand than ACS. HR controlled with
labetalol IV which will also help bring down BP. TTE done that
did not show any wall motion abnormalities, but did show reduced
EF with global hypokinesis.  Patient should follow-up with
cardiology. He is discharged on metoprolol for rate control.
.
# Hyponatremia: Hypovolemic hy
