Attending:[**Name (NI) 9308**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
71 year old man with recent hospitalization [**Date range (1) 28125**] for heart
failure, during which he was diuresed and discharged home. He is
a poor historian. He reports that he has been taking his Lasix,
but for the past day or so has been having shortness of breath
and discomfort in his xiphoid/epigastric region. It is "mild" in
intensity and does not radiate. He denies nausea, vomiting, and
abdominal pain. His shortness of breath limits his ability to
walk. He saw his primary care RN three days ago and was
instructed to increase his Lasix dose by 80mg daily x 3 days.
.
In the ED, triage vitals were T97.4F, BP 101/56, HR 95, Sat
94%RA. He was given 325mg aspirin. CXR showed no acute process
and improvement from prior with better aeration, although he
still has decreased lung volumes. He was noted to have bibasilar
rales and expiratory wheezes, and given increased creatinine
(1.7)
.
Review of the Atrius records indicates that his [**Location (un) 2274**] caregivers
were quite concerned about him at home given his medication
noncompliance and recommended that he stay in the hospital until
completely diuresed or go to short term rehab.
.

CHEST X-RAY PA and lateral [**2151-5-21**]:
Similar to the prior exam, lung volumes are diminished with
marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm again noted and
stable. There is improved aeration with no focal consolidation
or superimposed edema noted.  Mild aortic tortuosity is again
noted with calcified plaque at the arch. The cardiac silhouette
size is stable and likely top normal accounting for patient and
technical factors. No effusion or pneumothorax is noted. The
osseous structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Stable chest
x-ray examination with no definite acute pulmonary process.
.
CT Scan of CHEST on [**2151-5-29**]:
1. Mild atelectasis at the right base.
2. Opacification noted in prior study is due to vessels
tortuosity. No
concerning lung lesion or lymphadenopathy is noted.
3. Small amount of ascites.
.
RENAL Ultrasound on [**2151-5-26**]:
The study is slightly limited by difficulties with positioning.

The right kidney measures 10.4 cm. The left kidney measures 9.8
cm. No
stones or hydronephrosis are identified. The bladder is
decompressed with a Foley catheter noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 71 yo M with history of CHF (EF 30-35%) and
recent admission for CHF now admitted with dizziness, chest
pain, and shortness of breath.
.
#) Shortness of Breath: Likely multifactorial.  His initial
presentation was consistent with acute on chronic systolic heart
failure. The patient was diruesed with IV Lasix, but
subsequently became dehydrated and developed hypotension and
acute on chronic renal failure.  He was transfered to the CCU
for further management.  In the CCU: his diuretics were held to
allow renal recovery.  Despite diuresis and appearing
near-euvolemic on exam, he remained dyspneic.  Pulmonology was
consulted for further investigation.  ABGs demonstrated
hypercarbic respiratory acidosis, likely due to his obstructive
airway disease.  Patient improved by using BIPAP from 10pm-7am,
and treating for COPD exacerbation with azithromycin and
prednisone taper. He has an appoitment to follow up with his
outpatient cardiologist.
.
#) Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient developed acute
on chronic renal failure in the setting of overdiuresis. He was
treated with initially IV fluids and then with holding of Lasix.
 Upon recovery of renal function, Lasix was resumed at 80mg po
daily.
.
#) Hypotension: On [**2151-5-25**], the patient's blood pressure was
noted to be 82/doppler. This responded quickly, with a fluid
bolus, with systolic blood pressure subsequently 110. The
patient was transferred to the CCU for further management.  On
admission to the CCU, his blood pressure was normotensive and
remained such throughout the rest of his admission.
.
#) Chest pain: The patient had chest pain prior to admission,
which recurred on [**2151-5-25**], in the setting of hypotension to 82.
He ruled out for MI.
.
#) History of CVA: The patient was subtherapeutic on admission.
Warfarin was started at 10 mg daily. Subsequently, the patient
became supratherapeutic and warfarin was held.  Warfarin
continued to be held in the setting of hematuria and rectal
bleeding.
.
#) Rectal bleeding: Patient had intermittent boughts of BRBPR.
According to Atrius records, he has known hemorroids. H/H have
been stable. Patient will follow up with his PMD for this issue.
.
#) Hematuria: Patient's foley was frequently irrigated and
eventually switched to a 3 way foley. He has known prostate CA.
H/H stable throughout admission and there were no signs of
urinary tract obstruction. Patient will follow up with his PMD
and his PMD will refer to urology as needed.
