Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 18369**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68174**] is a 51 year-old male with metastatic RCC status
post left radical nephrectomy in [**3-/2198**], status post Avastin
and sorafenib, most recently on Sutent monotherapy since
[**12/2198**], with mild renal insufficiency, who presented from home
on [**2199-6-21**] with shortness of breath and fever. Of note, he was
hospitalized at [**Hospital6 **] from [**Date range (1) 68175**] with chest
pain, at which time he reportedly had cardiac enzymes, an
echocardiogram and a pharmacological stress test performed. It
is unclear from history what these studies revealed.
He reports that he felt fatigued during the week prior to the
current admission. On the day of admission, he felt "congested"
in his chest, and had a new fever. He was taken to the ED by his
wife. [**Name (NI) **] reports a mild cough for 2 days PTA, non-productive. He
denies a history of aspiration events or choking with food
intake. He describes mild reflux symptoms at night. Further ROS
reveals mild SOB in the days preceding admission, but he tells
me that he was surprised to find out about his low oxygen
saturation because he did not feel that bad. He denies chills,
no chest pain, no LE swelling.
In the ED, Tmax 102.8, BP 100-140/60s, HR 80s, RR 20s, Sat 75%
on RA in triage, up to 100% on NRB. CXR with bibasilar
consolidations. He was given Levo 750 mg PO X1, and Flagyl 500
mg PO X1. His BP decreased to 100 systolic despite hydration
with 2L of NS. He was subsquently admitted to the ICU for
further care. He was placed on Levo and Ceftriaxone. A
cosyntropin stimulation test revealed cortisol 32.1-->36.4. His
oxygen requirement decreased, and his overall status improved
quickly. He is being transferred to the floor for ongoing care.

Past Medical History:
1. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, diagnosed in [**3-/2198**], status
post left radical nephrectomy at [**Hospital1 112**] in 03/[**2198**]. Path consistent
with renal cell carcinoma of chromophobe type with [**Last Name (un) 68176**]
nuclear grade of [**5-1**]. Lymphovascular invasion was present. He
later presented with increasing back pain, and metastatic
disease was documented. He is status post Avastin plus
sorafenib, protocol #04-393, discontinued in the setting of
ongoing grade III rash, involving the hands and feet in addition
proteinuria secondary to the Avastin. He has been maintained on
single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] therapy with Sutent 50 mg daily as of
[**12/2198**] and has completed nearly 6 cycles. He has mild renal
insufficiency in the setting of Sutent.
2. Seasonal allergies

Social History:
He lives at home with his wife and son, who is 7 years old. He
works in real estate development and invests in stockmarket. HE
is a lifelong non-smoker.

Relevant Imaging:
1)Bilateral LE doppler ([**6-21**]): No evidence of deep venous
thrombosis in the lower extremities bilaterally.

2)Cxray ([**6-21**]): New bibasilar consolidations are demonstrated
accompanied by bilateral small pleural effusion. The lung
volumes are slightly increased. There is no pneumothorax
identified.

3)CT Torso ([**6-24**]): 1. Marked interval enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette. Together with the interval development of bilateral
pleural effusions, this indicates cardiac insufficiency (or
alternatively volume overload) and an echocardiogram may be
indicated for further evaluation.
2. Bilateral basilar compressive atelectasis. Superimposed
infectious consolidation is likely. 3. Interval development of
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] nodular opacities and scattered ground glass
opacities involving the right lung, concerning for an infectious
process. The differential diagnosis of this is wide including
viral, fungal and atypical mycobacterial infections. Drug
toxicity would be a consideration, although somewhat less likely
given the unilaterality of the findings. 4. New jejunal wall
thickening with persistent distal ileal wall thickening and
diffuse mesenteric stranding, most likely reflecting an
infectious etiology. 5. Overall stability in metastatic burden.

4)ECHO ([**6-25**]):Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved
biventricular systolic function. Mild posterior mitral valve
prolapse with mild mitral regurgitation. Small (0.6 cm)
circumferential pericardial effusion, largest around the left
atrium.

5)L femur xray ([**6-25**]): Predominantly sclerotic lesion with
interval periosteal new bone formation involving the
intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric regions. No displaced
fracture is demonstrated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68174**] 51 year-old male with metastatic RCC on  Sutent
since [**12/2198**], admitted with fever, hypoxemia, and bibasilar
pneumonia.

1) Bibasilar pneumonia: Patient was treated for
community-acquired pneumonia. He was initially placed on
Ceftriaxone, Levaquin, and Flagyl in the ICU but then changed to
Azithromycin & CTX at time of transfer to the oncology service.
He continued to have an oxygen requirement and CT scan suggested
ground glass opacities, suggestive of an underlying infectious
process. ECHO was done and confirmed normal ejection fraction.
His respiratory status improved slowly, oxygen was weaned off,
and he was discharged on course of Levaquin.

2) Metastatic RCC: Sutent was held on admission in light of
acute infection.
He underwent a staging CT scan torso which suggested no
significant increase in tumor burden. Patient was also found to
have abnormal TFTs on Sutent and was started on replacement
therapy. He will need follow-up bloodwork as an outpatient.
Recent CT scan showed destruction of L femoral neck. He
underwent an xray of the L femur which did not suggest an acute
fracture. No limitations were placed in regards to weightbearing
status. Patient was instructed to restart Sutent next [**Year (4 digits) 766**].

3) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine improved from 2.1 to 1.3
