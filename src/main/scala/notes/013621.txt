Imaging studies:
CXR: [**2190-9-6**]
The tracheostomy is at the midline in unchanged position. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but unchanged. There is
overall
improved aeration of the right base with resolution of
atelectasis but the left retrocardiac atelectasis is grossly
unchanged. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.

[**11-16**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
probably normal (LVEF>55%).

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities. No
change
compared to [**2189-9-4**].


Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo F with DM1, morbid obesity, CAD, diastolic CHF, and
sarcoidosis w/chronic tracheostomy who p/w SOB [**3-13**] HTN induced
flash pulm edema.

# Respiratory Distress: On arrival to ED the patient was 86%RA
and improved to 95% with trach mask. A CXR showed bilateral
pleural effusions and retrocardiac opacity and her BNP was 1511.
The pt was given 1 sublingual nitro with improvement in her
breathing and subsequently started on nitro gtt with improved
control of BP. The pt was also given 80mg IV Lasix in the ED.
The patient's respiratory distress was treated with diuresis
with an additional dose of IV lasix (20mg). The patient was
negative 8L during her stay in the MICU with improving
respiratory status. Upon transfer to the floor she was on
Hi-Flow, 15L at 40% FiO2 decreased from 60%FiO2.  She continued
to auto-diurese and was an additional 2-3L negative.  She was
placed back on her home dose of po lasix (40mg [**Hospital1 **]). Her
respiratory status returned back to baseline and the patient
reported that she was feeling much improved. The patients
respiratory distress was most likey mulitfactorial in origin
although most likely [**3-13**] pulmonary edema in setting of HTN.
Other contributing factors contributing include her chronic
sarcoid, interstitial disease and asthma. BNP elevated on
admission although not markedly so compared to previous CHF
exacerbations. The patient's CXR did show retrocardiac opacity
but has remained afebrile, minimal elevation WBC and no
antibiotics were given.

# ID/UTI: Pt has chronic indwelling foley.  On admission the
patient had a +UA, but the patient was asymptomatic. She
received 1 dose of zosyn in ED and her foley was changed.
Antibiotics were held because there was no clinical evidence of
infection.

# DM1: The patient was continued on her home dosing of lantus
(62U), with regular sliding scale. Her glucose was elevated
ranging from 200-350.  Her lantus dose was progressively
increased to 68U and came under control. She was dicharged back
on her home dose of lantus, at the patient's request, with close
follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **].

# Hypertension: In the ED the patient had elevated BP and given
sublingual nitro and started on a nitro gtt.  Her BP came under
control and she was started back on her home BP regimen of BB
and Losartan. The patient's BP remained under control.

# Coronary artery disease: Was stable during admission.  Pt
continued on home ASA 325, beta blocker, statin, and [**Last Name (un) **].

# HA, The patient complained of headache and a CT-head was
performed that showed no evidence of acute pathology. The
patient's HA resolved without treatment.
