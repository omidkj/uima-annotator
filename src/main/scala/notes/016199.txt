Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19836**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, cough

1) Thoracentesis
2) VATS /Decortication
3) 2 left sided chest tubes placed/removed
4) PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10940**] is a pleasant 85 year old female with past medical
history significant for
HTN, atrial flutter, mitral regurgitation and prior hemorrhagic
CVA in [**2191**] leaving her with some residual right hemiparesis who
was initially admitted on [**1-26**] with complaints of generalized
weakness, malaise, cough and fevers. She explained she had been
too weak on the morning of her ED presentation to even stand up
with her walker. Also complained of some minimal associated
nausea at times.
In the ED on [**1-26**] her initial vital signs were: Temp 98F and
Tmax 100.8F, BP 160/70, HR 81, RR 16 and 93% on room air. CXR
revealed a LLL pneumonia and she was started on Levofloxacin.
While on levofloxacin she continued to have sluggish clinical
improvement and her WBC rose from 12 range to 19-20k on [**1-27**]
and then on [**1-28**] her repeat CXR was worse with increasing
pleural effusion in the left mid-lung with worsening infection
in that location so a chest CT was ordered and her antibiotics
changed to vanco/cefepime at that juncture. CT chest done [**1-29**]
showed moderate, partially loculated left pleural effusion,
anterior LUL consolidation consistent with pneumonia as well as
a 5cm aneurysmal dilation of the ascending aorta.
.
Thoracic surgery consult was called and performed thoracentesis
that was notable for pH 7.10 and patient failed further
interventional pulmonology directed drainage attempt of her
loculated parapneumonic LLL pneumonia/effusion. Thus, she was
then set up for a VATS decortication on [**2199-1-31**] with chest
tube placement.
.
Per thoracics surgery, patient tolerated VATS decortication
procedure very well with exception of mild non-sustained episode
of NSVT ectopy upon leaning her on her side briefly but this
resolved in about 15 seconds per report. She had approximately
300-400cc semi-solid (gelatinous-like material) removed and sent
for additional cultures. She had 2 chest tubes placed to -20 cm
of water suction (posterior on the skin-> apical; anterior on
the skin-> basilar) and her lung expanded nicely. There was also
an area of some small nodularity over pleura noted and these
were biopsied for ruling out malignancy. BAL also sent for
cultures. Post-op vital signs in PACU were HR 60s, BP 112/60s
and she was still intubated at time of surgical sign out.
Estimated blood loss 75cc and given 1.5L IVFs.
.
Patient arrived to the floor and appeared to be in no acute
distress but was still with slurred speech at times and seemed
mildly sedated from recent drugs in surgery but would answer
direct questions and became attentive quickly with redirection.
Arrival vital signs were: T 97.5F, BP 110/60, HR 70, RR 16 and
she arrived on shovel mask @35% O2 with oxygen saturations of
93-96% range. Denies any pain. Patient has two small dressings
along left lateral rib cage that appear clean and non-bloody
with two protruding chest tubes.
