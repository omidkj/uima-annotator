Few episodes overnight and again this morning.  This AM also

exception of V5-V6 ST/T changes, unchanged from prior dated
[**2157-6-1**]. ECG from OSH at 7am: notable for more significant
STD/TWI in V5-V6, borderline STD in III and aVF.
.
Imaging/results:
CXR [**6-1**]
Single AP frontal view of the chest was obtained. The patient is

status post median sternotomy. The upper two sternotomy wires
are broken.  Consolidations in the right upper lobe as well as
in the lingula, inferior left upper lobe and likely left lower
lobe are highly worrisome for multifocal pneumonia. Trace
bilateral pleural effusions may be present. No pneumothorax is
seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.
The aorta
is calcified.
.
CXR [**6-2**]
1. Bilateral lung opacities, in similar distribution compared to
prior, appear more organized on the left, concerning for
multifocal pneumonia. Central lucency in the left perihilar
opacity, could be small cavitation; although to early to tell.
2. Appropriate positioning of the left IJ catheter height.
3. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**6-6**] repeat
1. Interval improvement in multifocal pneumonia.
2. Stable mass-like right upper lobe opacity concerning for
malignancy as
suggested on recent CT.
.
CT contrast [**6-3**] w/o contrast: prelim
1. Right upper lobe mass as well as findings compatible with
multifocal pneumonia. The mass in the right upper lobe may also
represent pneumonia, but short interval followup is recommended
to exclude a mass lesion.
2. Mediastinal adenopathy.
3. Small bilateral effusions.
4. No cavitary lesions within the lungs.
5. Renal cysts.
6. Status post splenectomy.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old man with h/o Hodkins s/p XRT/splenectomy,
transfusion dependent MDS with anemia/thrombocytopenia,
CAD/CABG, Gout, hypothyroidism admitted with acute onset
fever/chills/cough/hypoxia, found to have multifocal PNA with
mild sepsis. Initially admitted to MICU with pneumosepsis.
Recieved 4L fluids and broad spectrum Abx. Stabilized and
transfered out of MICU [**6-2**]. Please see plan below by problem:
.
Multifocal PNA with resolved pneumosepsis:  Acute onset in
asplenic patient with MDS.  Presented with mild sepsis and
admitted ICU initially. Recieved fluids, oxygen, and 72hours of
broad Abx: Vanc, levo/flagyl, CTx to cover for severe CAP with
MRSA coverage. Was transferd to floor day after admission. He
continued to improve and his oxygen was weaned off. Since he
remained afebrile and his Blood Cx remain negative after
72hours, his Abx were narrowed to Levo only on [**6-4**] with plan
for 7days course (has one more day left on discharge). His
sputum gram stain showed GPCs in pair but culture showed sparse
OP flora. By time of discharge, his cough was improved, he had
good sats on RA, and was afebrile for several days. Of note, he
underwent a CT scan shortly after admission given concern for
mass/cavitation on CXR in RUL. This showed multifocal PNA but
also showed a more dense RUL mass. While this is most likely
also the PNA, pt does have a h/o XRT to chest. He reports h/o R
lung "nodule" but cant clarify details as PCP was out of town.
We repeated a CXR on discharge which showed an improvement in
his PNA but stable RUL mass concerning for PNA. He needs a short
term repeat CT to make sure this resolves, and if not, needs to
discuss further w/u with patient. I have relayed this to
covering PCP as well as patient.
