Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 63F HTN, met NSCLC s/p multiple failed chemoRx regimens,
undergoing palliative XRT who presents w/ n/v/diarrhea, found to
have fever to 102.1 and hypoxia, with CTA(+) for bilateral PE.
.
#PE with hypotension
This is secondary to hypercoagulable state from met NSCLC. Head
CT negative for metastasis. Confirmed with heme/onc fellow; okay
to anticoagulate. in ED, patient not considered a candidate for
thrombolysis with her cancer.  She has been on heparin gtt(HIT
negative) throughout hospital stay.  Echocardiogram was done
with good RV contractility and no dilation.

#Afib:
Patient was in atrial fibrillation since [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission. She was
started on IV diltiazem, IV amiodarone and po metoprolol,HR
still not well controlled. She was converted to po medication on
the day that she expired. No cardioversion per cardiology since
patient has good blood pressure and is aymptomatic. Her thyroid
function test was normal

#respiratory distress
Differential includes pulmonary edema, new pneumonia, intrinsic
lunf cancer, PE. CXR repeated [**3-21**] and showed worsening pulmonary
edema. She diuresed very well with lasix and had better
respiratory status. Echocardiogram showed EF 60%, severe
pulmonary artery hypertension with 2+ TR; likely secondary to
OSA/intrinsic lung pathology. CXR did not show any sign of
pneumonia. LENIn only showed left popliteal DVT, not likely to
be throwing off emboli. Increased nebs and added flovent with
good effect.
.
#NSCLC-
Multiple failed chemoRx treatments; now only receiving
palliative XRT to thoracic spine.Deferred all current treatment
in setting of acute illnesses as above. Fentanyl patch and pain
meds continued for pain management.

#endo
[**Last Name (un) **] stimulation test was negative. High dose dexamethasone was
discontinued  and continue low dose for cord compression

#N/V:ileus.
Narcan was added to promote motility. She was eventually able to
tolerate food and passed gas.

#code
Had extensive family meeting with patient and family. Patient
finally decided to be DNR/DNI. Patient developed respiratory
distress on the day that she expired. This did not get better
even with lasix. Chest Xray did not show any acute process. She
deteriorated quickly and she passes away with very supportive
family member at her side. She was pronounced dead on [**2169-3-23**].
