Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
sudden cardiac arrest; ventricular fibrillation arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None this hospitalization

History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year-old Male with a PMH significant non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy (cardiac MRI showing dilated LV with
mild-to-moderate global systolic dysfunction, EF 42%, mild MR in
[**2165**]), HLD, known LBBB who was in bed this morning at 7:45 AM
and his wife noted him to be unresponsive with agonal breathing.
She moved him to the floor and started CPR. His son (a
firefighter-paramedic in-training) was notified and arrived to
assist with CPR. Of note, the patient flew to [**State 8842**] for
vacation on Tuesday last week and returned urgently given the
news that his brother had expired from [**Name (NI) **] at age 55 years-old.
He returned from [**State 8842**] Sunday evening. EMS arrived and an AED
was placed; three shocks were fired for ventricular fibrillation
(torsades de Pointes appearance) on the rhythm strip, and CPR
was resumed. There was ROSC and he had some spontaneous
movements, but he remained unresponsive on arrival to the
[**Hospital3 78558**] ED. The evening prior to his AM
arrest, he was without any complaints and fell asleep
comfortably.
.
In the [**Hospital3 **] ED, initial VS 97.6 149/106 89 14 100%
intubated. He was intubated (had spontaneous respirations,
dilated pupils, rechecked at 3-4 mm) and sedated with a Propofol
gtt. EKG showed sinus rhythm with known LBBB. Portable CXR noted
some pulmonary congestion. Laboratory studies showed a WBC 8.3,
HCT 42.9%, PLT 211. Potassium 3.8 and creatinine 1.0. INR 1.0.
Troponin-T < 0.01. pro-BNP 80.9. A urinalysis was negative.
Hypothermia protocol was initiated and he was given 2L chilled
normal saline and reached a core temperature of 32.6 degrees
Celsius. Propofol gtt was continued. A Dopamine gtt was started
given some SBP in the 70-80 mmHg range. He was given Fentanyl
250 mg IV x 1 and Rocuronium 50 mg IV x 1. He was also given
Amiodarone 300 mg IV x 1. [**Location (un) 86**] [**Location (un) 7622**] transported the
patient to [**Hospital1 18**] at 9:05 AM. Prior to in-flight arrival, he
received an additional 200 mg of IV Fentanyl, Midazolam 2 mg IV
and Rocuronium 60 mg IV x 1. His rhythm strip demonstrated sinus
tachycardia to the 110s with left-bundle morphology noted.
.
Of note, the patient was found to have a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 30% by echocardiogram in [**12/2163**] that was
performed after an EKG was noted to be abnormal. A repeat
2D-Echo in [**2165-3-30**] revealed a LVEF of 20% with global
hypokinesis. Cardiac catheterization was performed in [**5-/2165**]
revealing normal coronary arteries and low normal right and left
sided filling pressures. A cardiac MRI was performed [**7-/2165**],
showing an effective forward LVEF of 39% without evidence of
scarring or infarction. The right
ventricular ejection fraction was normal. Given these findings,
he was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Electrophysiology clinic, and he
recommended repeating a 2D-Echo, which was done in [**8-/2167**] and
showed an LVEF of 40-45% and thus ICD placement was deferred at
that time.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient arrived on cooling protocol
and was minimally responsive given sedation and paralyzation.
His rhythm was sinus tachycardia to the 110s with a left
bundle-branch morphology. Initial VS, 91.9 112 137/54 19 100%
(CMV/assist 500/14/5/100%). ABG 7.27/48/177.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.
.
ROS: The patient denies a history of prior stroke/TIA, deep
venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. They deny bleeding at
the time of prior procedures or surgeries. Denies headaches or
vision changes. No cough or upper respiratory symptoms. Denies
chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness; no palpitations.
Denies shortness of breath. No nausea or vomiting, denies
abdominal pain. No dysuria or hematuria. No change in bowel
movements or bloody stools. Denies muscle weakness, myalgias or
neurologic complaints. No exertional buttock or calf pain.

disease)
2. Hyperlipidemia
3. Erectile dysfunction (previously on Cialis)

Social History:

time. He takes [**3-3**] alcoholic beverages per week. He has a never
smoking history. He denies recreational substance use.

Family History:
His family history is notable for heart failure and sudden
cardiac death in a maternal aunt at the age of 57 years. His
