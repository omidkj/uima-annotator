CT TORSO ON [**5-30**]

CLINICAL HISTORY: Enhancing intracranial mass lesions, with
large mass seen on chest film. Confirmation of findings is
requested.

TECHNIQUE: Helical acquisition of CT images performed from the
thoracic inlet through the ischial tuberosities following
administration of both oral and IV contrast. No prior studies
available for comparison.

There are no prior CTs available for comparison.

FINDINGS: In the setting of mild underlying emphysematous
changes, there is a large, 4.0 x 3.5 cm mass with spiculated
margins located in the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe,
which abuts the pleura but does not appear to demonstrate chest
wall invasion at this time. This corresponds to the chest x- ray
abnormality. There is a large 1.9 x 1.8 cm prevascular lymph
node which extends to the AP window, as well as numerous
non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal nodes, the next largest
situated in a right precarinal location measuring 10 x 10 mm.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. No additional
suspicious mass lesions are seen within the pulmonary
parenchyma. There is linear scarring or atelectasis at the lung
bases, and a calcified granuloma at the right lung base. Small
blebs are scattered throughout the lungs.

Below the diaphragm, there is a very large bilobed mass which
appears to be centered in the left retroperitoneum, likely
originating from the left adrenal gland, with overall
measurements of approximately 10.4 x 9.2 x 8.8 cm. This mass is
predominantly nonenhancing with likely necrotic center, however,
there are multiple enhancing septations and a thickened,
somewhat nodular enhancing rim, compatible with metastatic
disease. A similar, much smaller 13 mm lesion is seen at the
apex of the contralateral right adrenal gland. There are small
retroperitoneal lymph nodes which are nonspecific, some of which
are marginally enlarged, the largest in a left paraaortic
location measuring approximately 17 x 9 mm (image 72).

The liver maintains an overall normal appearance without
ascites. There is a small hepatic cyst. There is a very large
gallstone within a nondistended gallbladder. The spleen and
pancreas appear normal. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast
symmetrically, there is a right renal cyst. There is no
hydronephrosis.

Loops of bowel are decompressed and overall normal in
appearance. Contrast passes to the distal colon at this time.
The uterus and adnexal structures are unremarkable. A Foley
catheter is seen within the decompressed bladder. There is no
free fluid in the pelvis.

There are no suspicious osseous lesions identified, however
there are compression fractures at both L4 and T10, of unknown
chronicity. Atrophic psoas muscles with focal fatty replacement.

IMPRESSION: Presumably stage IV lung cancer, with a large left
upper lobe mass, enlarged mediastinal lymph node and bilateral
adrenal masses, left much greater than right. The findings were
discussed with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], physician's assistant for
neurosurgery, by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at the time of initial interpretation.
Vertebral compression fractures at L4 and T10, age indeterminate
