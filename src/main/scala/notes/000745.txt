HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88 year old
woman status post an episode of dizziness and headache and
found to have a cerebellar hemorrhage at an outside hospital.
Patient had dizziness and vomiting at a bank in the afternoon
on the day of admission and was driving erratically.  She was
brought to [**Hospital **] Hospital where she vomited coffee ground
material and head CT showed a cerebellar bleed.  Patient then
deteriorated neurologically, became sleepy with slurred
speech, was intubated and sedated and transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  AAA.  Hypertension.  COPD.
Hypothyroidism.  Status post right ankle ORIF in [**2142-12-19**].

MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl, Lipitor, Evista, Diovan, Dyazide,
folic acid.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin and ACE inhibitors.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure was 110/50, heart rate
65, respiratory rate 14, sat 100% she was intubated.  In
general, she responded to painful stimuli.  Chest was clear
to auscultation.  Heart regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was
soft, nondistended, nontender.  She had mild leg edema.  She
was decerebrate posturing and unresponsive neurologically
when she came in.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 14, hematocrit 36.1, platelets
205.  Sodium 137, chloride 102, CO2 30, BUN 25, creatinine
1.3.  INR 1.0.  CPK 174, MB 7.6, troponin less than 0.2.
Head CT showed a 4 cm left to midline cerebellar hemorrhage
with compression of the fourth ventricle.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
neurosurgical intensive care unit where a ventricular drain
was placed without complications.  Neurologically post drain
patient was following commands, showing two fingers, left arm
maybe slightly weaker than the right.  Pupils were 6 down to
3.5 mm.  She had possible doll's eyes.  On [**2143-2-8**] patient
was awake, attentive.  Speech with mild slurring.  She was
oriented times three.  Pupils left 6 down to 3, right 4.5
down to 2.5.  EOMs were full.  She had severe left upper
extremity ataxia without significant drift.  Moving all
extremities with good strength.  She was neurologically
stable.  Her vent drain was leveled at 10 cm above the
tragus, keeping her systolic blood pressure less than 140.
She was on steroids to assist with brain swelling.  She had a
repeat head CT on [**2143-2-8**] that showed good placement of the
ventricular catheter.  Ventricles were slightly smaller,
although the fourth ventricle was still clotted with blood.

The patient continued to remain neurologically stable.  On
[**2143-2-10**] the vent drain was not working and it was replaced.
Patient was extubated on the 19th after vent drain placement
and patient's neurologic status improved.  Patient continued
to remain stable and the vent drain was replaced on [**2143-2-10**].
Patient was on ceftriaxone for vent drain prophylaxis.  On
[**2143-2-12**] patient again was awake, alert, slight slurred
speech.  No drift, but mild ataxia.  Moving all extremities
with good strength.

The patient continued to remain stable until [**2143-2-13**] when she
had the sudden onset of left sided weakness and agitation.
Repeat head CT was basically unchanged.  Her weakness
eventually resolved.  She was seen by the stroke service who
felt the CT was basically unchanged.  Patient also had an MRI
after the CT scan which did not show any infarct.  Patient's
left sided weakness eventually resolved.  On [**2-14**] patient was
awake, alert and oriented times three.  EOMs were full.
Smile was symmetric.  She had no drift at that point.  She
was back to her baseline.  Vent drain continued to drain
clear CSF.  She was seen by physical therapy and occupational
therapy and was followed closely by the rehab service.  On
[**2-18**] patient was awake, alert and oriented times three.
Patient did have slight left pronator drift.  Her IPs were
[**4-22**].  She remained neurologically stable.  We began weaning
the ventricular drain.  It was raised to 15 cm above the
tragus on [**2-18**].  She was weaned off steroids and remained
on 2 liters of O2 via nasal cannula.

On [**2143-2-21**] the patient had a repeat head CT after having had
her vent drain clamped for 24 hours.  It did show dilated
ventricles, therefore, the drain was opened and left at 20 cm
above the tragus.  Patient remained neurologically stable
despite hydrocephalus.  She was awake, alert and oriented
with no drift.  On [**2143-2-28**] patient developed the acute onset
of left hemiparesis and lethargy.  Repeat head CT showed
extension of the bleed in the right frontal area where the
vent drain had been placed.  Therefore, patient was taken to
the O.R. for evacuation of this intracranial hemorrhage.
Post-op vital signs were stable.  She was intubated and
sedated.  Pupils were equal, round and reactive to light.  On
the 14th patient opened her eyes to stimulation.  She moved
her right leg, wiggled her right toes.  She had left
hemiparesis.  She withdrew slightly to pain on the left.
Pupils were 5 down to 3.5 mm and briskly reactive.  She
continued to have the vent drain and now at 10 cm above the
tragus.  From a neurologic standpoint she was ready to be
weaned from the ventilator as tolerated.

On [**2143-3-2**] the patient had a repeat head CT which showed no
change.  Patient remained on Nipride.  Blood gases were
stable with an elevated CO2 level.  Patient was arousable and
oriented, following commands and moving all extremities to
command.  MRA screening test was negative.  Patient again had
an attempt at weaning her ventricular drain which she did not
tolerate the second time.  Therefore, she was scheduled for
VP shunt placement.  On [**2143-3-5**] patient's respiratory status
deteriorated and she required reintubation.  On [**2143-3-8**]
patient had right VP shunt placed.  Intra-op there were no
complications.  Patient's post-op course was complicated by
patient's inability to wean from the vent.  She was
arousable, wiggled her toes.  Pupils were 6 down to 5 mm and
brisk.  On [**3-14**] patient was moving all extremities to sternal
rub, following commands, squeezing on the right, although
weakly.  Moving the left side.

The patient was extubated and had rising CO2 on her blood
gas.  On [**3-16**] patient was arousable, following commands,
moving all extremities to command, right greater than left.
Continued to have rising CO2 of 70 on her blood gas.  She
continued to be extubated and was on cool mist face mask at 4
liters.  Due to the rising CO2, patient became more
lethargic.  At that time family was approached for code
status.  A family meeting was held on [**2143-3-18**].  They wished
for patient to be DNR/DNI, although as far as trach and PEG,
patient's family wanted to discuss it and would get back to
the team.

The patient's family ultimately decided that she should be
trached.  Therefore, she had trach placement.  Neurologically
on [**2143-3-21**] patient's pupils were 6 down to 5 mm.  She opened
her eyes.  She moved all extremities and lifted both arms up
off the bed to command.  Patient's family did decide on trach
and PEG.  Patient had a trach placed on [**2143-3-26**] without
complications.  A PEG was placed the following day without
complications.  Patient was transferred to the floor on
[**2143-3-31**] where she has remained neurologically stable.  She
was awake.  She was easily arousable, opened eyes, followed
commands, moved all extremities.  Has been out of bed to
chair.  Patient's O2 requirements began climbing on [**2143-4-2**]
and, therefore, repeat chest x-ray was obtained.  Patient had
bilateral pleural effusions which she has had since early in
her admission.  She had pleural tap done in the ICU and was
looking like she was going to require a second pleural tap.
The interventional pulmonary service was consulted on [**2143-4-4**]
and a pleural effusion tap was done on [**4-4**] without
complications.

The patient's condition has remained neurologically stable.
She is awake, alert and oriented times three, moving all
extremities.  Is at times sleepy, but easily arousable.  Has
been out of bed to chair.  Has been continuously foll
