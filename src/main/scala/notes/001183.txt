Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
pre-syncoble episode

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2181-2-8**]
1. Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending coronary artery; reverse
saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the 1st diagonal
coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein graft from the aorta to
the distal right coronary artery.
2. Bilateral pulmonary vein isolation with the AtriCure Synergy
bipolar RF device with resection of left atrial appendage.

History of Present Illness:
69 year old gentleman with hypertension, AAA and SVT, was found
to be in new atrial fibrillation in [**2180-7-30**] after presenting
to the hospital with shortness of breath. He underwent
successful left atrial PVI ablation on [**2180-10-13**]. His EF at that
time was noted to be in 25-30% without clear cause. He developed
recurrent atrial fibrillation on [**2180-12-6**] and underwent another
electrical cardioversion. He now reports progressive exertional
dyspnea along with an overall decreased level of energy. He was
previously taking Furosemide on a PRN basis, and now is taking
it more frequently, although not everyday. He reports a
presyncopal episode approximately one week ago when he was
standing in the grocery store and developed a warm sensation
associated with some lightheadedness. He was able to get outside
to some fresh air, he felt a little better, and he was able to
drive himself home and took a 3 hour nap. He felt much better
after sleeping for a bit. He continues with intermittent
shortness of breath; however his greatest concern is his lack of
energy and fatigue. He is now being referred to cardiac surgery
for revascularization and possible MAZE.

Pertinent Results:
[**2181-2-8**] Echo: Pre Bypass The left atrium is dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. The
right atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 25 %). There is inferior wall and apical
akinesis. The remaining left ventricular segments are
hypokinetic. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is mild to moderate anterior
leaflet mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.
Post Bypass: Patient is A paced on Epinepherine 0.03 mcg/kg/min.
Inferior wall function is somewhat improved as is global
function. LVEF 30%. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] moderate post bypass, but is
mild after chest closure at a cardiac output of 5 lpm and sbp
110-120. Aortic contours intact. Remaing exam is unchanged. All
findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

CXR [**2181-2-12**]
FINDINGS: Aeration of the right and left lungs is improved with
residual
small bilateral pleural effusions. No consolidation or
pneumothorax is
present. The heart and mediastinal contour are normal.
Sternotomy wires are

IMPRESSION: Improved aeration of the lungs. Persistent small
bilateral
effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 97236**] was a admitted one day before surgery since he was
on Coumadin and required a Heparin bridge. The day of admission
he also underwent usual pre-operative work-up. On [**2-8**] he was
brought to the operating room where he underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 3 and MAZE procedure. Please see operative
report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Amiodarone was started day of surgery for atrial
fibrillation. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Beta-blockers and diuretics
were initiated and he was gently diuresed towards his pre-op
weight. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per
protocol. Coumadin was initiated for his atrial fibrillation and
titrated during his post-op course with a goal INR of [**1-31**].5. On
post-op day three he was transferred to the step-down floor for
further care.  His lasix was held for increased cr to 1.6 but
was down to 1.2 on discharge.  He was ready for discharge to
rehab at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] Nursing on postoperative day five.
