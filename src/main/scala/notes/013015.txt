HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old gentleman
with past medical history of asthma, recent Group A
Streptococcus, non-necrotizing fasciitis, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for his
recent infection the day of admission.  At the appointment, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] noted that the patient had a significant cardiac rub.  A
chest x-ray was ordered which documented that there was
significant cardiomegaly compared to his previous chest x-ray one
week prior to admission.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] referred the patient to
the [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Department for
echocardiogram to evaluate for a possible pericardial effusion.
In the Emergency Department the patient was noted to have
significant accumulation of pericardial fluid and
physiological evidence of cardiac tamponade.  The patient was
admitted from the Emergency Department to the Cardiac
Intensive Care Unit for hemodynamic monitoring.  The
cardiology fellow was consulted regarding the need for
pericardiocentesis.  Given the patient's blood pressure was
stable, the decision was made to hold off on pericardiocentesis
until the morning following admission, so the patient could have
the full attention of all members of the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma.
2.  Gout.
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
4.  Mild anemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Amoxicillin 500 q. 8 hours.
2.  Singulair.
3.  Albuterol.
4.  Salmeterol.
5.  Fosamax 70 q. Tuesday.
6.  Calcium with Vitamin D.
7.  Fluticasone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.1, heart
rate 55, blood pressure 151/56, respiratory rate 22, oxygen
saturation 98% on room air.  In general, she was a
well-appearing elderly male in no apparent distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat was anicteric.  Facial muscles
were symmetric.  Mucous membranes were moist.
Cardiovascular, borderline tachycardia, notable soft,
vocal-like rub at the left lower sternal border.  The patient
had a pulsus paradoxus at 22.  Pulmonary, the patient was
noted to have basilar crackles, no wheezes or rhonchi.  The
abdomen with active bowel sounds, soft, nontender.  The
patient had mild mid epigastric tenderness as well as right
upper quadrant tenderness.  There was no apparent guarding,
no rebound, no evidence of acute abdomen.  Extremities, he
had mild 1+ peripheral edema, isolated only to his feet
bilaterally.  Feet were warm.  He has had some notable
conjunctival pallor.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiac - The patient was noted to have
tamponade physiology on his transesophageal echocardiogram in
the setting of recent pericarditis.  The patient was taken to
the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on [**2113-5-11**] for
pericardiocentesis.  The procedure drained approximately 550
cc of bloody fluid.  On post procedure the patient's
pulsus paradoxus decreased to less than 10.  The patient
did have some pain post procedure, for which she was treated
with Toradol and Morphine with good effect.  The drain was
removed after 24 hours.  The patient was followed with serial
echocardiograms which did not reveal reaccumulation of the
fluid.  He had three separate echocardiograms performed.
There was some notation of increased density on the perimeter
of his pericardium which could be possible.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**]
discussed with the patient that this may place him at risk
for developing a constrictive etiology in the future.  The
patient was informed that if he develops worsening shortness
of breath or lower extremity edema, he should call Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] for further evaluation
immediately.

2.  Rhythm - The patient was in normal sinus rhythm on
admission.  Initially he was noted to have short runs of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia no greater than 5 beats
in a row.  This resolved with drainage of the pericardial
fluid.

3.  Ischemia - The patient had his cardiac enzymes cycled.
There was no evidence of coronary artery disease by cardiac
enzymes.  The patient had no history of coronary artery
disease.

4.  Heme/infectious disease - The patient had a recent Group
A Streptococcus non-necrotizing fasciitis for which he had
been treated with Amoxicillin for a ten day course.  The
patient completed a ten day course during this
hospitalization with the last day being [**2113-5-14**].  In
addition, the patient was noted to have a history of chronic
anemia which had been described as sideroblast anemia by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2148**].  The patient also was noted to have Vitamin B12
deficiency during the hospital stay.  He was started on B12
supplementations during his hospital stay and will be started
on Vitamin B12 p.o. 100 q.d.

5.  Pulmonary - The patient has a history of asthma, which
appears well controlled.  He was continued on his home asthma
medications which include Fluticasone, Salmeterol, Albuterol
and Montelukast without any exacerbations during his hospital
stay.  In addition, the patient had some history of lung
nodules and has been recommended to have a repeat
computerized tomography scan which had not been done.  During
this hospital stay, the patient did have a repeat chest
computerized tomography scan which showed moderate
pericardial effusion, moderate bilateral pleural effusions
left greater than right and bibasilar atelectasis.
Computerized tomography scan was able to comment on the tiny
nodule in the lingula which was unchanged as well as the 2 mm
left upper lobe nodule which appeared unstable.  They were
unable to comment on the previous 6 mm nodule in the left
lower lobe given this was obscured by pleural fluid.  Based
on the chest computerized tomography scan though, it appears
that none of the nodules have changed in size.  If there is
concern, then a repeat chest computerized tomography scan can
be performed as an outpatient in the future.

6.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was
noted to have the bilateral pleural effusions and had been
given a significant amount of hydration prior to having the
pericardiocentesis to maintain adequate preload.  The patient
was diuresed with Lasix with good effect prior to discharge.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  The patient's pain with deep
inspiration has resolved.  The patient is tolerating a full
p.o. diet.  The patient is ambulating without difficulty.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Cardiac tamponade.
2.  Idiopathic pericarditis.
3.  Pericardial effusion.
4.  Asthma, mild.
5.  Anemia of chronic disease.
6.  B12 deficiency.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient should follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] within one to two weeks of discharge.  In addition
he was informed he should call Dr.[**Name (NI) 3811**] office the
day following discharge to make an appointment.  He was
advised to schedule an echocardiogram approximately one week
prior to his next appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**].

1.  Salmeterol 1 puffs b.i.d.
2.  Montelukast 1 tablet p.o. q.d.
3.  Fluticasone 2 puffs b.i.d.
