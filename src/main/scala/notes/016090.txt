Brief Hospital Course:
1. GI bleed: pt had GI bleed of unclear source before admission,
likely [**2-10**] supratherapeutic INR in setting of coumadin therapy
for MVR.  She was initially admitted to the MICU [**2-10**] markedly
decreased HCT on anticoagulation.  However, she was
hemodynamically stable during her entire hospital course.
Coumadin was d/c on admission and the pt was placed on heparin
gtt for anticoagulation in prep for workup for source of bleed.
EGD showed gastric erosion w/ no evidence of active bleeding.
Colonoscopy was normal.  SBFT was performed and demonstrated no
clear source of bleeding.  Coumadin was restarted when no source
of bleeding was identified, and heparin was continued until INR
reached goal of 2.5-3.5, after which the heparin was d/c.  At
d/c, there is no evidence of active bleeding and HCT is stable.
It is likely that her initial bleed was [**2-10**] gastric bleeding in
setting of INR of 11.  She will require f/u after d/c for
coumadin monitoring.

2. MVR: the pt was initially supratherapeutic on coumadin w/ INR
11.  Coumadin was d/c until INR was normal.  Meanwhile, the pt
was anticoagulated w/ heparin gtt as above.  When INR
normalized, coumadin was restarted for goal INR of 2.5-3.5, and
heparin was continued until INR reached goal as above.  The pt
will need to continue coumadin after d/c.

3. Afib: rate controlled during this admission, pt w/ VVI pacer.

4. CHF: no evidence of decompensated heart failure during this
admission.  Treatment was continued w/ her outpt dose of lasix
w/ good effect.

5. DM2: pt's oral meds were held on admission in case of need
for IV contrast.  BG was controlled w/ RISS during that time.
At d/c, the pt will resume her usual outpt regimen.

6. Code status was full code during this admission.
