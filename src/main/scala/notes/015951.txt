Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**]
Chief Complaint:
Easy bruising, malaise, bony pain, concern for leukemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement
LP with IT chemo x 2

History of Present Illness:
23yoF with h/o asthma and ADHD who is being admitted out of
concern for acute leukemia. She was in her USOH until [**7-12**] when
she presented to [**Hospital6 **] with intermittent, L-sided
chest pain. CXR was read as normal. She was treated for
bronchitis with azithromycin. She again presented to the ED on
[**7-14**] with similar complaints and began taking ibuprofen for the
pain. Over the course of the past month she has experienced
worsening sweating - at night and during the day, worsening
fatigue, bilateral arm heaviness, easy bruising, and petechial
rash on her arms and legs. She presented to [**Hospital6 33**]
with these complaints and CBC showed thrombocytopenia to 15 as
well as lymphocytosis. There was initially concern for ITP or
rickettsial infection, but peripheral blood was sent for flow
cytometry, which reportedly showed lymphoblasts.
.
At present, she complains of bilateral arm pain and pain in her
back between her shoulder blades. She is diaphoretic. She does
endorse worsening fatigue recently as well as intermittent
nausea. She understands that she may have leukemia.

FLOW CYTOMETRY: RESULTS:

Cell marker analysis demonstrates that a majority of the cells
isolated from this peripheral blood are in the
CD45-dim-to-moderate, low side-scatter, 'blast gate'. Gating on
these cells demonstrates that these cells express immature
antigens CD34, HLA-DR, and TdT, lymphoid associated antigens
CD10, CD19 and CD20 along with CD71. They lack surface
immunoglobulin light chains kappa and lambda. They lack
T-associated antigens (CD3, CD5, CD2, CD7, CD4, CD8) and are
negative for myeloid associated antigens CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33,
CD117, CD11c, CD41, CD56, CD64 and Glycophorin A.

CD45 bright lymphocytes comprise 24% of total analyzed events.
B cells comprise 18% of lymphoid-gated events, are polyclonal,
and do not express aberrant antigens. T cells comprise 63% of
lymphoid-gated events, express mature lineage antigens, and have
a decreased helper-cytotoxic ratio of 0.7:1 (usual range in
blood 0.7-3.0).

INTERPRETATION

Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (pre B-ALL).

Please correlate with morphologic and cytogenetic findings (see
separate report).  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] notified on [**2131-8-16**].

BONE MARROW:
SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:

DIAGNOSIS:
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, see note.
Note: The morphologic findings on this core biopsy specimen
combined with concurrent flow cytometry findings on peripheral
blood (S11-33319M) are consistent with the diagnosis of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B-ALL). Please correlate with
cytogenetic findings (see separate report).
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Peripheral Blood Smear:

The smear is adequate for evaluation. Erythrocytes appear mildly
decreased in number, are normochromic with rare dacryocytes,
echinocytes, fragments,  microcytes and nucleated red blood
cells noted. The white blood cell count appears mildly
increased.  A majority of circulating cells are variably sized,
with moderately condensed to open chromatin, prominent nuclei,
round to slightly irregular nuclear contours, scant amounts of
basophilic cytoplasm and occasional coarse granules.  Platelet
count appears significantly decreased.  Differential shows 12%
neutrophils, 20% lymphocytes, 68% Blasts.
Aspirate Smear:

The aspirate material is not submitted due to dry tap.
Touch Imprints:

Touch imprints are adequate for evaluation. The smears are
hypercellular with sheets of small to medium sized cells, with
scant cytoplasm, smooth chromatin, prominent nucleoli and
slightly irregular nuclear contours, morphologically consistent
with blasts
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:

The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of
two bone marrow core biopsies composed of trabecular bone with
bone marrow elements, the overall cellularity is more than 95%
and consists almost entirely of a monotonous population of
variably-sized cells with round to regular nuclei, open
chromatin and scant amount of cytoplasm.  Occasional atypical
mitoses are seen in the neoplastic cells.  Rare scattered
myeloid precursors, plasma cells and small erythroid islands are
seen.

BCR-ABL: Normal, see cytogenetics report for full description

TTE [**8-16**] The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity appears small, with normal free wall
contractility. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.

Impression: Suboptimal image quality. The right atrium and, to a
lesser extent, the right ventricle appear extrinsically
compressed. However, due to the technically suboptimal nature of
the acquired images, neither cardiac tamponade secondary
