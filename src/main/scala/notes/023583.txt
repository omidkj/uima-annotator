Chief Complaint:
transfer from MICU with rhabdomyolysis, ARF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular tunnelled line placement


History of Present Illness:
37yoW with h/o ivdu, bipolar disorder, asthma who presented to
[**Hospital1 **] s/p fall with ?syncope after heroin abuse.  Patient
fell in the bathroom and was unconscious for an unspecified
amount of time but thought to be between 9-12hours.  On
presentation to [**Hospital1 **] she complained of right hip and back
pain, and bilateral LE numbness, and was found to be in
rhabdomyolysis.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where CK
>200,000 and creatinine 3.0 with UA +blood, no RBCs, +muddy
brown casts.  She received 6L D5W and 3amps bicarb and was
admitted to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, nephrology, psychiatry, and neurology services were
consulted.  Initial CT showed a right flank hematoma, edematous
soft tissue in the neck, and cerebral edema.  She was anuric.  A
foley catheter was inserted, and she continued to receive
aggressive IVFs.  She was oliguric, and by day 3 was 1600cc
positive.  IVFs were discontinued and she was treated with lasix
120mg iv x1.  Patient exhibited bilateral lower extremity
weakness.  MR showed no evidence of cord compression. Neurology
consult found bilateral weakness not consistent with a focal CNS
lesion.  She was initially in a C-collar after her fall.  She
was cleared by clinical exam, CT, and MR.
.
On presentation today she complains of sharp and aching pain all
over including her head, chest, abdomen, back, and all four
extremities.  She denies shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, dysuria.  patient has a h/o ivdu, but
had been off heroin for 7years.  This was her first time using
since then.  She expressed regret saying "this was stupid
stupid."  Mood is "ok."  She denies any SI.

Pertinent Results:
Head CT [**2142-3-23**]:  No intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
Cannot exclude mild diffuse cerebral edema, MRI might be helpful
for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.

CT spine [**2142-3-23**]:
1)  No evidence of fracture or subluxation within the cervical
spine.
2)  Extensive  asymmetric inflammation/edema within the
posterior musculature of the right neck.  This finding could
represent an infectious process or the sequelae of trauma.

CT Abd/Pelvis [**2142-3-23**]:
1)  Large hematoma and soft tissue injury in the muscles of the
right flank.
2)  No intraabdominal or pelvic acute injuries.

Spine MR [**2142-3-23**]:
- C-spine: Mild degenerative changes.  No evidence of
intraspinal fluid collection.  No evidence of extrinsic spinal
cord compression or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities.
Diffuse increased signal within the muscles and soft tissues of
the neck and upper back.  This could be secondary to diffuse
muscular inflammation and clinical correlation recommended.
- T-spine:  No evidence of spinal cord compression or
intraspinal fluid collection in the thoracic region.  No
evidence of compression fracture or spinal stenosis.
- L-spine:  Mild degenerative changes at L5-S1 level.
Otherwise, unremarkable study of the lumbar spine.

Brief Hospital Course:
37yoW with h/o if drug use, asthma, and bipolar disorder who was
transferred from an outside hospital with rhabdomyolysis and
acute renal failure.  During her hospitalization the following
problems were addressed:

1.  Rhabdomyolysis: The patient was at first treated with
aggressive iv fluids, NS and D5W with bicarb to alkalanize the
urine.  Initial CK was 200,000.  This value trended down
throughout her hospitalization.  Secondary to her renal failure,
she stopped making urine.  She consequently became fluid
overloaded.  She was treated with one dose of iv lasix prior to
transfer to the floor, but did not put out urine to this.  She
was not given any subsequent iv fluids, and CK's continue to
decline.  Pain was controlled with morphine.  Her needs were
calculated, and she given standing MS Contin as she has a risk
of heroin abuse.  Pain was also somewhat relieved after dialysis
was started and fluid taken off. She was discharged on Percocet
for pain control.

2.  Acute renal failure:  Renal service was consulted. Findings
were consistent with ATN.  She became oliguric, making only
about 40-60cc/urine per day.  On [**2142-3-27**] she had a tunnelled
right subclavian line placed by IR and was started on
hemodialysis. Her urine output began to increase to around 300
cc per day at discharge. She will continue on hemodialysis as an
outpatient until her renal function retur
