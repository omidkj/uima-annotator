Liver Duplex [**1-1**]
FINDINGS:
Difficult study due to the patient's recent postoperative state,
nonetheless
diagnostic images were obtained. No focal or textural
abnormality seen in the
liver. The portal vein and its major branches are patent with
normal flow.
The main hepatic artery and its major intrahepatic branches are
patent with
normal flow demonstrated. The three hepatic veins are patent
with normal flow
seen. No biliary duct dilatation seen. The spleen is enlarged
measuring 17.7
cm. No intra-abdominal free fluid seen.

IMPRESSION: Patent hepatic vasculature post-liver [**Month/Year (2) **].
Splenomegaly.

Liver Duplex [**1-7**]:
CLINICAL INDICATION: Hep C, status post liver [**Month/Year (2) **], [**12-31**]
now with
elevated LFTs.

The liver shows some increase in echogenicity in a patchy
distribution
suggestive of patchy fatty infiltration. There are no focal
liver lesions
seen nor is there any evidence of bile duct dilatation. A 4 x 5
cm right
subhepatic hematoma is noted. Splenomegaly is also again noted
with the
spleen measuring 16.3 cm in length.

Color flow and pulse Doppler assessment of the [**Month/Year (2) **] was
performed. All
portions of the portal and hepatic venous system are well
visualized and
showed normal color flow and pulse Doppler characteristics. The
inferior vena
cava was fully patent with normal pulse Doppler. The left,
right, and main
hepatic arteries show normal waveforms with resistive indices
ranging from
0.67-0.71.

CONCLUSION: Normal liver Doppler and no bile duct dilatation.
Heterogeneous
hyperechoic regions consistent with fatty infiltration.
Small-to-moderate
right subhepatic hematoma also noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted for OLT on [**2116-1-1**].  The operation went well
with no complications.  He was transferred to the SICU in stable
condition.  His POD0 liver duplex was found to be normal.  He
was extubated on POD 1, and then transferred to the inpatient
floor in good condition.  Initially his serum blood sugars were
difficult to control and the patient was placed on an insulin
drip.  He was stabilized on a sliding scale regimen by POD3, and
his diet was advanced to clears.  Of note, the patient was found
to be hypertensive, and this was initially managed with IV lasix
and PRN IV hydralazine.  As the patient's volume status
normalized and he was able to take PO's, he was given amlodipine
which seemed to normalize his hypertension.  The patient
progressed very well through his post operative course.  On
POD6, the patient underwent a liver duplex which showed patent
vasculature with normal waveforms as well as a patent biliary
system without dilatation.  On POD7 the patient's pain was well
controlled on oral medication, was ambulating and voiding
without difficulty, and had received all of his instruction
regarding meds and blood sugar recording.  Due to persistent
drain output from his lateral JP, he was to be sent home with
drain teaching.  He was then deemed ready for discharge.
