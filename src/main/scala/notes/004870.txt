History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28685**] [**Known lastname **] is an 85 yo pt. of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10865**] with h/o afib,
diastolic and systolic heart failure [**2-17**] HTN, with EF of 45%
last year, who presented to ED yesterday with increased LE,
orthopnea and cough as well as decreased urine output. No SOB or
DOE, though pt. with minimal exertion. Denies fevers, chest
pain. Pt. and family had d/c'd all medications other than lasix
and coumadin in [**2147-12-16**] (toprol, lisinopril, amiodarone) [**2-17**]
feeling sluggish, delusions which were attributed to medications
wtih apparent improvement in these symptoms.
.
In the ED, she afebrile was tachycardic to 140s in afib, satting
93%RA. She was given IV dilt 20 and started on a dilt gtt with
improvement in BPs. She had CXR showing globoid cardiomegaly,
mild pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion. Given IV
Lasix 80 in ED and started on lasix gtt on the floor.
On floor, she was additionally she was started on amio load,
12.5 metop. She converted to NSR and became hypotensive to SBPs
80s, so dilt gtt stopped. On lasix gtt, titrated to 20mg/hr with
continued poor UO. (I/O ~ 450/800). Pt. increasingly showing
[**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing. ABG with respiratory alkalosis, satting
well. Pt. received bedside ECHO showing reduced EF to ~15-20%
with 4+ TR, 2+ MR, restrictive physiology. Pt. transferred to
CCU at this point for pressors, closer monitoring.

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**4-5**]

The right atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are thickened/fibrotic. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: severe systolic and diastolic left venrticular
impairment

Compare to the previous study of [**2147-5-26**], severe systilic
dysfunction is now present, with restrictive filling pattern,
indicating markedly elevated left ventricular filling pressures
and markedly reduced ventricular compliance (as well as poor
prognosis).

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2147**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results on [**2148-4-5**].

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 85 yo woman with diastolic and systolic
heart failure with new severely impaired systolic heart function
likely tachycardia-induced.

Acute decompensated systolic and diastolic congestive heart
failure: Pt with known history of systolic and diastolic HF and
moderately depressed EF. Her current symptom complex in the
setting of high BNP appears consistent with an acute systolic HF
exacerbation in setting of medication noncompliance. Preliminary
bedside ECHO with EF 10-15% with global hypokinesis. TTE showed
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). Likely
tachycardia-induced due to chronic afib with RVR. Patient was
aggressively diuresed during her hospital stay on milrinone and
lasix gtt. She was diuresed >20L out during her hospital stay.
She was then weaned off milrinone which during the first trial
was not tolerated with hypotension and bradycardia off
milrinone. Plan was to plan for cath to document hemodynamics on
and off milrinone however as pressures good off milrinone during
second trial (turned off on [**2148-4-17**]), cath was cancelled. Patient
was restarted on low dose lisinopril and metoprolol with stable
BP and HR prior to discharge. Per son, baseline weight is 135
lbs. She was discharged home on Torsemide 20mg [**Hospital1 **] with follow
up in heart failure clinic.
.
CAD: Patient's presentation and worsened systolic heart function
not likely [**2-17**] ischemia. Negative stress 1y ago, EKG without
ischemic changes, global hypokinesis. Patient was continued on
aspirin and restarted on low dose metoprolol and lisinopril by
discharge.
.
Rhythm: During early hospital course, patient with episodes of
afib. She was on esmolol and loaded on amiodarone with taper.
After this, she has maintained NSR. Esmolol was switched to
metoprolol. Patient maintained on coumadin for anticoagulation.

You were admitted with symptoms of fluid overload which required
many medications and observation in the cardiac intensive unit.
It is very important that you take all your medications so you
do not reaccumulate fluid. Also, please weigh yourself daily and
call your physician if your weight changes more than 3 lbs.
