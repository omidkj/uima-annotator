.
[**2126-3-27**] TTE: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid
inferolateral segments. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). There is mild aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of
moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe calcific aortic stenosis. Mild symmetric LVH
with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral
segments. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
.
[**2126-3-28**] TTE: There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal inferior and inferolateral akinesis and
mid inferolateral hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-3-27**], the
severities of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation have
decreased. No
aortic regurgitation was seen in either study.
.
[**2126-3-29**] CT torso:
IMPRESSION:
1. Negative examination for aortic dissection. There is no
significant
narrowing in the visualized portions of the subclavian arteries.

2. Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications, mural thrombus, and
ulcerated
plaques along the aorta and visualized arteries. Patent SMA
stent. Patent
graft in right common iliac artery. Significant stenosis at the
origin of the celiac trunk. Focal aneurysm of the right common
femoral artery.
3. Focal bulging of the infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring up
to 25 mm.
4. Centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema.
5. Multiple lung nodules as described in the text, the largest
one measuring 7.6 mm. Initial followup chest CT is recommended
in three months.
5. Bilateral small pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
7. Gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis.
8. Multiple areas of thinning of the renal cortex that suggested
scars, prior ischemic/injury.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 56636**] is a 79 yo F h/o AS leading to CHF, CAD, HTN, PVD s/p
aorto-bifem s/p RLE stent, chronic kidney disease, AAA with
stenting who was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**3-25**] for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] evaluation of critical AS w/ [**Location (un) 109**] 0.3 cm2. She was
deamed not a good surgical candidate and went to cardiac cath
[**3-29**] for uneventful valvuloplasty.
.
# Aortic stenosis- s/p valvuloplasty. See post valvuloplasty TTE
aboce. Asymptomatic but pt never had symptoms at rest. Pt was up
and walking well prior to discharge on [**2126-3-30**]. She will follow
up with her PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 3782**] cardiologist.
.
# CORONARIES: Pt w/ 90% ostial left main lesion, occluded right
coronary artery on cardiac cath at OSH. Apparently, disease was
not nearly as severe on cardiac cath here today. Final cath
report is still pending at time of discharge summary. Continued
ASA, statin, ACEI, BB.
.
# PUMP: LVEF >55% here. Does not look to be fluid overloaded or
in CHF this admission. Discontinued home lasix as pt may not
need after valvuloplasty.
.
# RHYTHM: Pt in NSR on tele this admission. No h/o arrhythmia

.
# Chronic renal failure: Cr rose this admission to 1.8 from 1.5
on admission. Pt got mucomyst, bicarb with cardiac cath. At time
of discharge, Cr. was stable at 1.7.
.
# UTI- Treated with cipro for a total of 5 days treatment.
