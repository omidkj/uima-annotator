History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 year-old female with a history of CHF, COPD on 2L
NC, DM, HTN, HL, h/o DVT not on coumadin, psychogenic polydipsia
who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with a sodium of
111 thought secondary to polygenic polydipsia.  The patient
reports that she had gained 4lbs over the last few days, but
otherwise was in her normal state of health.  The patient
reports that today she felt weak and fell while going to the
bathroom.  She could not recall if she had LOC or had head
trauma, but no obvious trauma on exam.  When she was in the
ambulance en route to the OSH she developed acute SOB and was
placed on CPAP without much benefit. Her labs were significant
for Na 111 and given 1L NS x1.  They did not have bed and
transferred her to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED, afebrile 105 139/86 16 99% 4L NC.  Her labs were
significant for a sodium of 117.  She had CE negative x1 and BNP
273. She was given ASA 325mg.  She reported continued SOB. She
was given albuterol/ipratropium nebs and 60mg prednisone. A CXR
showed cardiomegaly. They performed a bedside U/S and did not
appreciate a pericardial effusion.  There was concern for volume
overload and she was started on a nitro gtt for pre-load
reduction. She was also placed on CPAP. A gas was obtained
7.44/48/148/34 that the ED reported as a VBG.  A CT-head was
negative.

On arrive to the ICU she remained on CPAP.  She stated that her
breathing had improved some what, but was still labored.  During
repositioning the patient had an acute desat to the low 80's
with significant, audible wheeze.  Her sats improved with a
combivent neb and she was placed back on CPAP.  Her breathing
improved and she then rested comfortably.

Of note, the patient reports that in [**9-29**] she was admitted to an
OSH ICU for aggressive diuresis and lost 87lbs during that
admission.  She then spent another 3 weeks at rehab and has been
at home since.

ROS:
stable 2 pillow orthopnea, denied PND and reported stable lower
ext edema.
The patient denies any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia,
chest pain, cough urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria,
lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision
changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

Discharge:


Pertinent Results:
[**2164-1-25**] ECG:
Moderate baseline artifact. The rhythm appears to be a narrow
complex
tachycardia at a rate of 109. P waves are seen in some of the
leads and it
appears to be sinus tachycardia with occasional atrial premature
beats.
There are non-specific ST-T wave changes noted in leads II, III
and aVF. No other diagnostic abnormality. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

[**2164-1-25**] CXR:
Mild cardiomegaly with small bilateral effusions and possible
mild
pulmonary congestion.

[**2164-1-25**] HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST:
No acute intracranial process.

[**2164-1-26**] CXR PORTABLE:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is massive
unchanged
cardiomegaly without evidence of overhydration. No pleural
effusions, no
focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.

ECHO [**2164-1-26**]:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve is not well seen. There is
no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity
is likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well
seen. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal
limits). The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a small to moderate sized, circumferential
pericardial effusion, measuring 1.8 centimeters in greatest
dimension. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with [**Month/Day/Year **],
inflammation or other cellular elements. No right atrial
diastolic collapse is seen. No right ventricular diastolic
collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Small to moderate sized, circumferential pericardial
effusion, measuring 1.8 centimeters in greatest dimension. Echo
dense effusion, consistent with [**Month/Day/Year **], inflammation or other
cellular elements. No echocardiographic evidence of pericardial
tamponade.

CTA CHEST ([**2164-1-30**]):
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small
on the right with associated compressive atelectasis. No
definite parenchymal
abnormalities identified.
3. Cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic calcification of the
coronary arteries.
4. Small hiatal hernia.

[**2164-1-31**] CXR:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
change. Moderate cardiomegaly with mild overhydration.
Retrocardiac
atelectasis. Potential minimal left pleural effusion. No focal
parenchymal
opacity suggesting pneumonia.

[**2164-2-7**] ECHO: (FOCUSED STUDY, PERICARDIAL EFFUSION)
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with [**Month/Day/Year **],
inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-1-26**], the
pericardial effusion appears similar.

[**2164-2-8**] ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:
No ascites.
