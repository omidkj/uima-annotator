History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 93733**] is a 67 year old man with history of severe COPD (on
3.5L home O2 and chronic steroids x 4 years, previously
intubated on several occasions), was who was hospitalized at
NEBH from [**Date range (1) 93734**] for a pseudomonal and proteus pneumonia,
and had been discharged on cefepime to pulmonary rehab at [**Hospital1 15454**] from [**Date range (1) 86904**], where on [**2174-1-10**] he was found to
have a bright red bloody bowel movement. His Hct was seen to
fall from 35.8 ([**1-8**] @11:40) to 32.7 ([**1-10**] @8:23). His Hct was
28.6 on [**1-10**] @10pm. He received one unit of pRBCs with Hct
increase to 33.2 ([**1-11**] @8:38). He was transfered to NEBH for
further evaluation however there were no ICU beds so he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. The patient's wife states that he had
worsening confusion for the 2 days prior to admission. She
states that he has been confused over the past few weeks over
the course of these illnesses.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED his initial vitals were unremarkable. He
received 1 dose of cefepime and flagyl and was admitted to the
MICU.
.
In the MICU he received one unit of PRBCs and serial HCTs bumped
appropriately and were stable. GI consulted and felt that there
was no urgent need for an inpatient colonoscopy. However, blood
cultures from [**1-11**] grew [**5-12**] bottle of pan-sensitive (ampicillin)
enterococcus. He was briefly treated empirically with vanc and
then linezolid until sensitivities were available, and then
switched to ampicillin [**1-14**].  He was not intubated but did have
an O2 requirement. His mental status was largely intact but he
did have episodes of agitation which responded to low dose
haldol. He was deemed stable for transfer to the floor on [**1-14**].

.
On the floor, he was afebrile and had no further GI bleeding.
Serial HCTs were stable. He continued to demonstrate an O2
requirement, satting in the high 80's to low 90's on 4-5L NC. On
the call of call-out he triggered for tachypnea, and he did
occasionally have brief (1 minute) self limited episodes of
tachypnea with associated desaturations to the mid-low 80's.
These were largely felt to be due to anxiety and he responded
well to low dose haldol and ativan. On [**1-17**], he reveived a PICC
line in anticipation of d/c. Later that afternoon, he became
hypoxic to the mid 70's and had increased somnolence. An ABG
showed extreme hypercarbia to 99. Due to his worsening CO2
narcosis/somnolence, he was voluntarily intubated and
transferred back to the MICU for further management.

Studies:
Abd X-Ray: Limited due to body habitus.  Bowel gas pattern
demonstrates no definite evidence of ileus or obstruction.
There is no free air on upright view.  Air is seen throughout
segments of the large bowel and appears unremarkable. Visualized
osseous structures are intact. Visualized lung bases are clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
Summary: 67 year old man with history of COPD, OSA, aflutter s/p
ablation with recent subacute altered mental status transferred
from OSH for w/u hematochezia found to have [**5-12**] blood cx
+enterococcus.
.
# Enterococcal bacteremia: The source of the infection was
unclear as culture data was incomplete. Urine or PICC line were
thought to be most likely sources. Pt initially treated with
linezolid; when sensitivities returned, he was transitioned to
IV ampicillin with a two week course planned. He received a R
PICC line on [**1-17**]. He was started  on IV ampicillin and
remained afebrile until his transfer back to the ICU on [**1-17**]
for hypoxia and hypercarbia. (see below). He was noted to have
worsening leukopenia and thromocytopenia while on ampicillin and
although it has probable better coverage than vancomycin, the
ampicillin was replace by vancomycin for total 14-day course.
.
# Respiratory: Pt began treatment at OSH for pseudomonas and
proteus PNA with ceftazidime on [**12-30**]; this was d/c'd after a 14
days. There was initially a question of possible TB exposure
given cavitary lesions reported on OSH CT, but AFB stain of BAL
were negative. A CT in-house shows emphysematous lesions,
retained secretions with L upper lobe lung nodules and RML
collapse. CXR also confirms opacity L base and RML/RLL collapse.
Pt also w/ significant COPD on high-dose steroids. On [**1-14**] he
was called out from the ICU. The patient's solumedrol was
transitioned to PO prednisone daily, with a taper planned. He
was started on Bactrim DS 3x/week for PCP prophylaxis while on
high-dose steroids. However, on [**1-17**], he demonstrated
increasing somnolence and an ABG showed a CO2 of 99, so the
patient was intubated for ventilation and transferred back to
the ICU. He was extubated after 24 hours and continued to do
well. His respiratory distress appeared to be exacerbated by
anxiety as well as intolerance of face mask.  His anxiety also
makes Bipap nearly impossible and he cannot use it to treat his
sleep apnea.  He does best on nasal cannula with O2 sat goal
90%.  Anxiety control is therefore paramount to his respiratory
status with emphasis on minimizing meds that will cause
somnolence and respiratory depression.
.
# Hematochezia: A lower source of bleeding was felt more likely
over upper source based on the presence of bright red blood.
Differential included diverticular bleed, ischemic colitis,
polyp, hemorrhoid. The pt's HCT responded appropriately to
transfusion of one unit pRBCs. GI was consulted; as the pt was
clinically stable, no inpt endoscopy was performed. The pt
should undergo colonoscopy as an outpt. [**Hospital1 **] PO PPI therapy was
initiated. His HCTs were entirely stable on the floor and he had
no further episodes of BRBPR.
.
# Mental Status and Anxiety: The patient's subacute change in MS
was felt likely related to steroids, sedating medications,
prolonged hospitalization. Sedating medications were limited,
although it was found that the patient has a good therepeutic
response to low-dose Haldol administered in the evenings. He was
evaluated by psychiatry who recommended discontinuing the
zyprexa the pt was on from his past hospitalization.  No further
diagnoses were established, but per pt's wife, he has a baseline
anxiety.  Haldol 0.5-1mg can be given on PRN basis but pt also
responds well to reasoning.  Ativan 1mg PRN can be second-line
treatment.
.
# HTN: The pt's home dose of diltiazem had been lowered given
bleed; this was slowly titrated back up with good effect.
.
# Atrial Tachycardia: The pt's home dose of diltiazem had been
lowered given bleed; this was slowly titrated back up with good
effect, though
