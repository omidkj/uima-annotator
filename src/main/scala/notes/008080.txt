History of Present Illness:
57 yo M recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] to rehab, now returns with
tachycardia, hypotension and increasing lethargy/malaise and
increasing WBC. Pt is positive for C diff, on PO Flagyl. En
route to [**Hospital1 18**], BP dropped to 70s so diverted to [**Hospital1 **],
where better access was obtained and an a-line was placed. He
received 3500cc crystalloid with improvement in his BP and he
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Recent admission [**4-27**] to this hospital with fever, leukocytosis
and hypotension, eventually dx'd with C diff and placed on PO
VAnco. Urine cx returned yesterday with pseudomonas resistant to
Cipro.

In the ED here, VS: 97.9, 100/44, 76, 16, 100% A femoral CVL was
placed. Levophed was started. He received Vanco, Zosyn, and
Flagyl after cx obtained.

On arrival to the MICU pt indicates that he feels better.

Radiographic studies:

[**5-11**] CT chest/abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No cause for the patient's sepsis identified. No
intra-abdominal or
intrapelvic abscess. No evidence of pneumonia.

2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.

3. Sacral decubitus ulcer with slightly increased gas in the
subcutaneous
tissues to the right of the coccyx. It is unclear if this
increased gas is
related to progressive infection or manipulation/debridement.
Clinical
correlation is recommended.

PORTABLE CHEST, [**2114-5-12**]

COMPARISON: Comparison study of one day earlier.

INDICATION: Possible pneumonia.

FINDINGS: Indwelling devices are in standard position, and
cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Lower lung volumes
result in crowding of bronchovascular structures, limiting
assessment of volume status of the patient. Increasing patchy
opacities at both bases may be due to atelectasis, but attention
to these areas on repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory
level may be helpful. Left-sided loculated fluid versus pleural
thickening is unchanged.
.
HISTORY: 57-year-old man, now status post placement of new PICC
line, assess
for placement.

COMPARISON: [**2114-5-12**].

AP PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:

The left-sided PICC line is seen curled around in the axillory
region.

The right subclavian central venous line is in unchanged
position with the tip at the mid SVC. The patient is status post
tracheostomy, but the apparatus is seen without apparent
complications. There is persistent low lung volume, with
appearance of crowding of bronchovascular structures. The
previously noted left side opacity is unchanged and also
suggestion of left- sided fluid vs. pleural thickening.

LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX ULTRASOUND DATED [**2114-5-16**]:
IMPRESSION: Thrombosis of the cephalic vein in the region of the
existing PICC line. No deep venous thrombosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
57M with MMP returning from rehab with rising WBC and hypoTN,
concerning for sepsis.

# Hypotension: Most likely cause in setting of leukocytosis and
recent infections is recurrence of sepsis (most likely urine,
but other possible sources include c diff, pneumonia, sacral
decubiti). No evidence of cardiogenic shock [**3-19**] cardiac ischemia
based on 12-lead; no indication of hemorrhage (guaiac neg).  In
the ED had right femoral line placed, was volume resuscitated
and started on Levophed.  Upon arrival in the ICU, he was
continued on volume resuscitation and he pressors were ulimately
weaned the day of admission.  Given his history of Cipro
resistent Pseudomonas and ESBL Klebsiella, he was empirically
started on Meropenum / Vancomycin with Flagyl given history of
C.diff.  On [**5-11**], a right subclavian line was placed and a CT
Torso was obtained to evaluate for potential source but was
unrevealing.  Once hemodynamically stable, he was transferred to
the floor for continued care. Patient remained stable on the
floor. Sputum culture showed yeast, all other cultures negative.
Plastic surgery examined sacral wound and felt was healing well,
