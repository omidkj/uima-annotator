History of Present Illness:
Patient seen and examined, agree with house officer admission
note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 111743**] with additions below

76 year old Male emergently transferred from [**Hospital3 26615**]
Hospital after being initially admitted after being found down
at his [**Hospital1 1501**]  with a severe COPD exacerbation that by report
devolved into bradycardic with idioventricular rhythm he was
given atropine x1, he was not hypotensive and did not receive
chest compression, and he was started on amiodarone. The patient
was ultimately intubated for his COPD flare as he developed
hypoxic respiratory failure and admitted to the MICU. While in
the micu, he was treated with prednisone for COPD flare and
extubated the day before admission at which time severe lower
extremity weakness was noted. He underwent urgent spine imaging
with both CT and MRI, which were concerning for epidural
abscess, diskitis, osteomyelitis and collapse of T9 with cord
compression with edema from T8-T11. Patient started on
vancomycin/Zosyn prior to transfer.

As [**Hospital3 26615**] has no spine surgery, he is emergently
transferred from spine evaluation. He is admitted to the medical
service as there are no critical care beds or neurosurgery beds
at this time.

Severe cord compression with edema extending from T8-T11

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 y.o. man with Stage IV COPD CAD s/p CABG, CHF
admitted to OSH with COPD flare, his course was complicated by
hypercarbic respiratory failure and lower extremity paralysis
with cord compression and paraspinal abscess now POD12 s/p
surgical debridement and fusion, course complicated by transient
episodes of complete AV block, poor systolic function,
respiratory failure x 2 requiring intubation, and hypotension
requiring pressors. His respiratory failure has resolved, his
hypotension is resolved on midodrine, but he has persistent LE
paralysis secondary to paraspinal abscess/cord compression.

Active Issues

#)Respiratory failure:
Per OSH, pt had COPD exacerbation leading to hypercarbic
respiratory failure and intubation and uneventful extubation.
He did experience dyspnea [**12-26**] excess secretions and atelectasis.
 Required ipratopium and saline nebs.  He was extubated and did
well enough to transfer from the MICU to the floor. However, he
began having respiratory distress and poor blood gases
necessitating transfer back to the MICU, where he was intubated
and put on pressure support. He became hypotensive and
tachycardic in this setting, likely b/c he was put on pressure
support b/c of concern for an ARDS picture. He was switched to
CMV, and his hypotension became less profound, and his
respiratory status improved. He was able to have sedation
reduced the 3rd day of his intubation ([**6-2**]). On [**6-3**], he was
able to have a successful spontaneous breathing trial, a RSBI
45, had O2 sats in the 90s, and was arousable but not able to
clear secretions. He did well on CPAP, but extubation was held
off due to his inability to clear secretions. On [**6-6**] he became
more alert, again passed an SBT, and had a RSBI<100. He was
given a trial of extubation since he was felt to be about as
good as he will be re: mental status. He passed this trial and
was able to be weaned down to 4L NC over the next few days w/o
having acute respiratory distress. Oxygen should be weaned as
tolerated for goal sat >90%.

# Hypotension:
This is the result of multifactorial processes: poor systolic
function + neurogenic hypotension + sepsis + sedation.  Also has
baseline orthostatic hypotension for which he was on
fludrocortisone prior to admission.  During his initial MICU
stay, he required IVF and pressor support and was successfully
weaned off after he was restarted on fludrocortisone at an
increased dose of daily instead of every other day.  However, he
again became hypotensive in the setting of pressure-support
ventilation and an [**Month/Year (2) 7792**].  He maxed out on levophed and was
placed on phenylephrine as well. When his ventilator settings
were changed to CMV, he was able to be weaned off levophed
althoug he remained on phenylephrine even after his MAP
titration floor was changed to <55. He also had elevated
troponins and was diagnosed w/ an [**Month/Year (2) 7792**] in this repeat setting
of hypotension, so the [**Month/Year (2) 7792**] may have contributed to his
hypotension by worsening his systolic function, although his
LVEF remained at 35% on f/u Echo. He was able to be weaned off
phenylephrine after extubation and was transitioned to PO
midodrine for blood pressure support.  He has follow-up with his
cardiologist [**7-7**].

# Epidural abscess and T9 osteomyelitis s/p debridement and
fusion:
Pt presented with cord compression and lower extremity flaccid
paralysis [**12-26**] epidural abscess and osteomyelitis.  After
surgical debridement [**5-23**], he was empirically covered with
vancomycin and ceftriaxone and flagyl. Epidural abscess cultures
revealed Gram+ cocci. Likely source was sacral decubitus ulcer.
ID on board and advised to continue vancomycin for 6 weeks since
the tissue grew Strep viridans but after sensitivities returned
changed the antibiotic to ceftriaxone. Antibiotics should
continue until [**2155-7-10**]. He will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1352**] of orthopedics in ~4weeks and will follow up at [**Hospital **]
clinic as well.  Weekly labs should be faxed to infectious
disease RNs with ESR, CRP and CBC/diff checked weekly.

#[**Hospital 7792**]:
In the setting of his hypotension upon his second transfer to
the MICU on [**5-31**], he was found to have elevated troponins for
which he was started on heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg, and ASA
325 for [**Month/Day (4) 7792**]. His troponins trended down [**6-1**], so heparin gtt
was discontinued. A TTE, which was poor quality, was performed
[**6-1**] which revealed LVEF 35%, moderate LV dilated systolic
dysfunction hypokinesis w/ distal 3rd of ventricle having
hypokinesis, nl R chamber, no AR/MR, and no effusions.  A
subsequent TEE was similar to the TTE. He was started on
clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily as well in this setting after being
cleared by ort
