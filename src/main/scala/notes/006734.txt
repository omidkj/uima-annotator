History of Present Illness:
85 year year old male with progressive shortness of breath for
past 4 days prior to presenting to outside hospital emergency
room. Treated for pneumonia, heart failure and NSTEMI. Ruled in
for NSTEMI with elevated CK and troponin see was worked up for
cardiac disease which included cardiac catheterization.  This
revealed coronary artery disease and he is referred for surgical
evaluation.

In relation to question of pneumonia as per pulmonary consult at
outside hospital no evidence of community aquired pneumonia,
however completed course of azithromycin for potential of
bronchitis. He also was continued on steroids for potential COPD
exacerbation however no previous history of COPD but current
tobacco use.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2122-8-17**]
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic root. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the ascending
aorta. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are complex
(mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.
POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. A pacing with PAC's.
Preserved biventricular systolic function with LVEF now 50%.
Improved anterior and inferior hypokinesis. MR is now 1+. The
aortic contour is normal post decannulation. The mobile atheroma
in the discending aorta is not seen post cpb.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 17204**] was admitted post NSTEMI and underwent an extensive
pre-operative work up during which an incidental lung nodule was
found for which he will have a follow up appointment with
thoracic surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] post cardiac revascularization.


His surgery was further delayed when he developed herpes simplex
for which he was treated with antivirals. Once his lesions were
crusted he was taken to the operating room on 7//[**12-18**] where he
underwent coronary bypass grafting, please see operative report
for details. In summary he had: coronary artery bypass grafting
x4 with Left Internal Mammary Artery to left Anterior descending
artery, reverse Saphenous Vein Graft to Obtuse Marginal, reverse
Saphenous Vein Graft to Diagonal artery, reverse Saphenous Vein
Graft to Posterior Diagonal Artery. His bypass time was 90
minutes with a crossclamp time of 70 minutes. He tolerated the
operation well and post-operatively was transferred to the
cardiac surgery ICU. He did well in the immediate post-operative
period. Weaned off Neo and transitioned to Lopressor. He woke
neurologically intact and was extubated on the morning of POD1.
He remained in the ICU that day to monitor his pulmonary status.
Anticoagulation was resumed for his history of DVT. He was
transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility. Postoperatively he has been intermittently confused
but is improving and today answers all questions appropriately.
he is very hard of hearing. His foley was replaced evening of
POD#3 for failure to void and drained 600cc. He was cleared for
discharge to [**Hospital 13040**] Nursing and Rehab rehab today on POD# 5
with foley in place. Plan voiding trial within a few days at
rehab. All follow up appointments were advised.

He has scant serosang drainage from the midportion of his
sternal incision. He must shower daily and will require the
incision to be painted daily with betadine and covered with a
DSD daily. He also has a follow up appointment to be seen on
[**8-27**] at 11am for a sternal wound evaluation.
