Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
unstable angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cath s/p stent to LAD


History of Present Illness:
83 yr old male with hx of CAD/3VD s/p LAD stent in [**2195**] presents
to [**Hospital1 18**] with flu symptoms and crescendo angina.  Pt states that
two days prior to admission, he was in [**Doctor First Name 26692**]
vacationing and went into atrial fibrillation (which he says has
happened before).  He used his NTG spray three times and
eventually converted back into NSR after 15 minutes.  One day
prior to admission, he started feeling flu-like symptoms such as
sneezing, congestion, fevers (measured at 100.5) and
non-productive cough.  His wife and grand-children are also sick
with the same symptoms.  Last night, pt states that he woke up
every three hours with chest pain that went away with one spray
of NTG.  Pt says the chest pain was the same as his typical
angina which is described as a substernal chest pressure
sometimes assoc with diphoresis.  The angina normally occurs
with walking and goes away with rest and NTG.  He was concerned
because last night, the pain awoke him from sleep.  Pt's last
episode of chest pain was at 7am this morning and he has been
pain-free since.  He denies orthopnea, PND, lower ext swelling.

CHEST, PA & LATERAL: There is again elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm with some linear atelectasis at the right lung
base which does not appear significantly changed when compared
with the previous study. The lungs are otherwise clear with some
minimal scarring at the left lung base which is unchanged. The
aorta is unfolded with wall calcifications. The cardiac size is
within normal limits. The osseous structures are unremarkable.
.
ECHO:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal
(LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation
is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Cardiac Cath:
1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed a
right-dominant system with three vessel disease.  The LMCA had a
distal
40% lesion.  The LAD had a patent proximal stent with a 90%
ostial D1
and total occlusion distal to that.  The distal vessel was
supplied with
L->L collaterals.  The Lcx was proximally occluded with the
distal
vessel filling via collaterals.  The RCA was proximally occluded
with
the distal vessel filling via collaterals.
2.  Left ventriculography was deferred.
3.  Opening hemodynamics revealed a normal central aortic
pressure (systolic 133mmHg).
4.  Successful Rotational atherectomy, PTCA/stenting of the
LAD/Diagonal
with a 2.5x28mm Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 3.0 in the proximal
two
thirds.  Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
dissection
and TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA comments).
5.  Right femoral arteriotomy site was successfully closed with
a 8F
angioseal closure device.
.
Chest CT:
1. Bilateral diffuse areas of consolidation, more in the upper
lobes than the lower lobes. Differential diagnosis includes
agressive pneumonia, including aspiration pneumonia, ARDS and
pulmonary hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 83 yr old male with hx of 3VD s/p stent to LAD presents
with crescendo angina in the setting of flu-like symptoms:
.
1. Chest Pain:  Dr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-2-12**]
with flu symptoms and crescendo angina that was relieved with
nitro spray.  EKG showed no changes and he ruled out for MI with
three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  Given his unstable
angina, he was started on a heparin drip and was scheduled for
the cath lab.  Cardiac catheterization revealed 40% LMCA, widely
patent prox LAD stent, 90% ostial large D1 with total occlusion
distal to that, 100% pRCA with distal filing and 100% LCx with
distal filling.  The LAD/Diag was stented using a DES.  On the
third hospital day, pt developed [**8-10**] SSCP that was not relieved
with nitro spray in the setting of atrial fibrillation and a
rapid ventricular rate. Cardiac enzymes were drawn and were
dramatically elevated; EKG showed lateral ST depressions
consistent with demand ischemia in setting of a fib with RVR.
Enzymes trended down after a troponin peak of 4.37.  Pt was
continued on his atenolol, asa, norvasc, [**Last Name (un) **] and statin.  He was
started on Plavix.
.
2. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Pt reported a hx of
occasional episodes of atrial fibrillation that converted to
bigeminy with a spray of nitroglycerine and then converted to
NSR with another spray.  As above, on the third hospital day, pt
had SSCP in setting of a fib with RVR into the 120s that was
rate controlled with 10mg of IV diltiazem and 10mg IV lopressor.
 He was then loaded with amiodarone and converted back to NSR.
He was started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation but this
was discontinued after pt had a GI bleed in the setting of a
supratherapeutic PTT.  While in the ICU, pt was on an amiodarone
drip and later switched to po amiodarone.  Pt complained of
severe nausea associated with the amiodarone so it was
discontinued once he was transferred to the floor.  Pt was
continued on his atenolol and was discharged home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of
hearts monitor to catch undetected episodes of atrial
fibrillation.  Pt is not anticoagulated given his hx of GI bleed
and colon cancer but this may need to be readdressed if pt
continues to have episodes of atrial fibrillation.
.
3. SOB:  Pt was admitted with flu sx such as congestion, fevers
and non-productive cough.  He ruled out for the flu and likely
had a viral upper resp infection.  On HD #4, pt became hypoxic
with an oxygen saturation of 80% on 4-5L NC which improved to
89% with nonrebreather. A stat CXR was done which revealed
bilateral pulm edema/alveolar opacities.  H
