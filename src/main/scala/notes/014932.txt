Brief Hospital Course:
87 y/o M w/ h/o afib on coumadin, VT s/p ICD, htn who presented
with GIB. He was initially admitted to the MICU but was then
called out to the medicine floor.  On the floor, patient
suffered a PEA arrest on [**10-31**] and was transferred back to the
MICU.  Patient was intubated and completed a 10 day course of
HAP/VAP.  During his MICU course he had a large bleed into his R
thigh presumably secondary to a femoral line placement.  His
heparin gtt was subsequently stopped.  He had persistent
respiratory failure and inability to wean from the vent.  Goals
of care discussions were held with his sons, one of which was
his healthcare proxy.  [**Name (NI) **] in his MICU course, his sons
decided to make Mr. [**Known lastname 94740**] DNR/DNI. His ICD was subsequently
turned off by Electrophysiology.  After ~ 10 days of intubation,
it was decided by patient's family to attempt to remove his ETT
with goals of care to be comfort if he was unable to maintain
his respiratory function according to the patient's known
wishes.  On [**11-12**], patient's vent was weaned down.  He continued
to show rapid shallow breathing as he had on all previous days.
He denied any subjective shortness of breath or discomfort.  In
the presence of his sons, he ETT was removed. He was treated
with morphine and ativan for comfort. He subsequently expired on
[**2115-11-12**] at approximately 6:10 pm. Family was at the bedside.
Autopsy was declined per the patient's sons [**Name2 (NI) **].

Please see below for more detailed description of hispital
course prior to MICU transfer following PEA arrest.
.
Anemia/GIB: Admitted [**10-24**]. Hct 22, down from 31 at last
hospitalization, and INR 5.8 on presentation to the ED. He
received 4u pRBCs and 2u FFP. Received PO and IV Vitamin K with
improvement in his INR. His coumadin, asa, and BP meds were
held. On [**10-24**], he had several small melenotic stools. NG lavage
was negative. GI was consulted and performed EGD and
colonoscopy, which showed diverticulae in right colon, EGD
negative. After the procedure, pt had a run of WCT (afib with
abberanncy vs VT; BP stable, assymptomatic). Potassium was 2.7
and was repleted, along with Mg. Tele with only occas VPCs
thereafter. He was called out to a tele bed.  On floor, HCT
stable.  He was diuresed and he also developed some worsening
mental status changes.  On [**10-31**] he had a witnessed PEA arrest
and was returned to the MICU. While in the MICU, he had a
further Hct drop while on heparin gtt and was found to have a
large hematoma in his R groin.  This was presumed secondary to a
femoral line placed during his arrest.  He was treated with PRBC
infusions and his Hct stabilized. His heparin gtt was d/c'ed and
he was started on sc heparin for ppx.
.
# respiratory failure: peri-arrest ABG suggested hypercarbic
respiratory failure. Unclear cause of hypercarpia. No sedating
meds. Pt has baseline mild restriction but not severe
obstruction. + wheezes on exam. Large aspiration event during
arrest and subsequent ARDS could explain.  He was weaned down to
PS by [**11-2**] and mental status improved.  But [**1-11**] likely PNA and
trauma from code.  He was unable to wean from the vent
throughout his MICU course requiring high levels of pressure
support. Goals of care were frequently addressed with his HCP
and family and as above, it was decided to extubate Mr. [**Known lastname 94740**]
with the goals of care to be on comfort in accordance with the
patient's wishes.
.
# PEA arrest: unclear cause. Evidence of hyperkalemia,
hypercarbia, and acidosis peri-arrest. Responded to empiric
hyperkalemia treatment during arrest. Returned back to baseline
AF with good rate control following arrest.
.
# hypotension peri-arrest: likely secondary to loss of
spontaneous circulation during code. No obvious evidence of
sepsis. No evidence of hemothorax or pneumothorax. Brief pressor
requirement quickly weaned off. Likely some cardiogenic
component following arrest.  Following pressor wean, act
