CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: ? pulm edema

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old woman with extensive PMH including CVA, CHF, PVD and
DM s/p fall from defective [**Doctor Last Name 2598**] Lift at home on [**7-2**] with C2
dens fx, R medial orbital wall fx and R subtrochanteric fx
currently has labored breathing with bilateral rhonchi
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? pulm edema
EXAMINATION: AP chest.

INDICATION: Abnormal breath sounds.

A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2188-7-7**] at 0828 hours.
No prior films are available for comparison. The patient is
rotated to the left side. There is no evidence of cardiomegaly.
There is arteriosclerosis and tortuosity of the aorta. There is
diffuse increase in the interstitial lung markings bilaterally.
There is minimal right costophrenic angle blunting.

IMPRESSION:

Increased interstitial lung markings bilaterally may reflect a
chronic process. In the context of acute shortness of breath;
however, interstitial edema cannot be excluded.



Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2188-7-4**]  10:21:14 AM

[**2186-6-9**] sinus
rhythm has appeared.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: Fx of TLS? please do recons of TLS spine, thanks
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old woman s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Fx of TLS? please do recons of TLS spine, thanks
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 68-year-old man status post fall. Evaluate for
fractures of the TLS.

COMPARISON: [**2188-7-4**] plain film of the hips.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images of the chest, abdomen and
pelvis were performed with IV contrast. Multiplanar reformations
were obtained. Images were performed per trauma torso protocol.

CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There enlarged lymph nodes in the
mediastinum and left hilum. For example there is a subcarinal
node measuring 10 mm in shortest diameter and a left hilar node
measures 12 mm in diameter. The pulmonary vasculature is
prominent and a small amount of fissural fluid is present. There
is no evidence of consolidation. No nodular densities are
identified. There is bilateral dependent atelectasis.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, adrenal glands,
right kidney are unremarkable. The left kidney contains a small
simple renal cyst within the left mid upper pole. The small and
large bowel are within normal limits. There is no free fluid or
free air.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a fibroid calcified uterus.
There are no adnexal masses noted. The urinary bladder is
catheterized. The rectum is filled with stool, which extends to
the cecum. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy. There are
multiple surgical clips seen within the left inguinal region.

BONE WINDOWS: Again noted is an intertrochanteric fracture on
the right with moderate displacement as seen on prior plain
film. No additional fractures are identified. Normal alignment
is seen within the visualized cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral
spines with no evidence of listhesis. No suspicious lytic or
sclerotic bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No radiographic evidence of traumatic injury with the
exception of a previously noted right intertrochanteric femoral
neck fracture.
2. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Possible etiologies
include sarcoid, granulomatous disease, and lymphoma. A follow
up dedicated chest CT is recommended to ensure stability.





Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the Trauma Service. Orthopedics and
Neurosurgery were immediately consulted because of her injuries.
Her C2 dens fracture was managed non operatively with a hard
cervical collar to be worn until follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**],
Neurosurgery, in 6 weeks.

She was taken to the operating room on [**7-6**] for repair of her
right femur intratrochanteric fracture. She was started on
Heparin for DVT prophylaxis. At baseline patient is
non-ambulatory; she will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Orthopedics
in 4 weeks.

Her pain was initially managed with PCA Morphine; this was later
changed to longer acting narcotics which will likely require
further adjustment given her increased pain postoperatively.

Because of pain control issues and her deconditioned status
patient had required supplemental oxygen to maintain her
saturations >93%. She wa eventually weaned off O2. She will
require pulmonary toileting post hospital discharge.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have
recommended short term rehab stay. Her insurance carrier has
denied her rehab stay, despite appealing the initial denial,
based on their criteria that patient has not met for acute and
subacute facilities. She is being discharged to home with
services as a result.
