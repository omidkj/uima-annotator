.
CXR [**4-25**]
FINDINGS: There is diffuse patchy opacity restricted to the
lingular segment with resultant obscuration of the left heart
border. This is highly consistent with a lobar pneumonia. More
linear opacity is noted in the right lung base likely related to
atelectasis. Finally, there is retrocardiac opacity with air
bronchograms. A multifocal infectious process cannot be
excluded. There is no superimposed edema. There is evidence of
prior median sternotomy and CABG. The aorta is tortuous with
atherosclerotic disease and the cardiac silhouette size is
enlarged with a left ventricular configuration. No definite
pleural effusion is seen. Please note the extreme right
costophrenic angle has been excluded. There is no pneumothorax.
.
IMPRESSION: Definite lingular infectious process. Question
possible involvement of the left lower lobe as well. Likely
atelectasis at the right base. Followup radiographs to document
resolution following appropriate therapy recommended
.
CXR
[**5-2**]:
Status post CABG. Heart size is within upper limits of normal
allowing for technique. Possible slight prominence of the LV
contour but no definite CHF/pulmonary edema. There is persistent
patchy opacity consistent with infection in the left mid and
lower zones with a small left pleural effusion, but the
consolidation in the left lower lobe has significantly improved
since the prior study of [**2109-4-27**]. There has also been
partial resolution of the right basilar atelectasis since the
prior film with residual linear atelectasis in this location as
well as linear atelectasis in the right upper lobe.Prominent
carotid calcifications.


Brief Hospital Course:
#Hypotension/Fevers/PNA:  Improved with aggressive iv hydration
and pressors in ICU.  Eventually pressors weaned and patient
extubated.  BPs remained stable on floor and pt gently diuresed
given some volume overload from resuscitation.  Blood and sputum
cultures negative; pt clinically improved on Levofloxacin.  Will
complete a total of 2 weeks of abx.
.
#CV: ECG withou acute changes, serial CE negative.  Discharged
on home regimine.
.
#Renal: Cr improved with IVF; likely pre-renal +/-ATN.
.
#Heme: Fe studies c/w ACD.  HCT stable in house.
