History of Present Illness:
68 yo male history of recent admission for AV block presumed [**2-16**]
to lyme disease, HTN, DM, prior IMI w systolic CHF (EF 40%), h/o
GIB (unclear etiology), who presented with acute onset dyspnea
while lying in bed at home, lasting for two hours. Patient was
discharged from cardiology service on [**2124-12-3**] following
admission for dyspnea, found to have a new heart block, elevated
troponin, and ST changes on EKG.  There was concern that his
new-onset AV block was secondary to lyme disease and patient was
discharged home on ceftriaxone.  He was also restarted on
aspirin during that admission.
.
Tonight the patient started having dyspnea while at home at
rest.  Pt denies chest pain, but complains of nausea, [**2-17**]
episodes of non-bloody emesis, which looked dark brown.  He got
up to go to the bathroom, felt lightheaded, and fell.  He did
not hit his head or lose consciousness.  Pt endorses dark stool,
but has noticed this since starting iron.  Pt denies fever,
cough, abdominal pain.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.3 96 98/50 16 96% RA. Exam was
significant for pale conjunctiva, guaiac positive dark stool.
Labs were notable for HCT of 16 (previous HCT was 27 5 days
ago), WBC of 20.4, potassium of 6.4, bicarb of 17, creatinine of
2.6, lactate of 7.4, and INR of 1.5.  EKG was significant for
sinus rhythm at [**Street Address(2) 111550**] elevations in II, III, aVF and
TWI in I and aVL, which was felt consistent with prior.  Two 18
gauge IVs were placed.  Patient was transfused 2 units pRBCs (4
additional units crossmatched). NG lavage with marroon return,
did not clear.  Patient was given protonix bolus with gtt.  For
his potassium of 6.4, patient received calcium chloride, insulin
and D50, albuterol, 1 amp sodium bicarb.
.
While in the emergency department, patient was noted to have
worsening dyspnea and on telemetry he became more bradycardiac
to the 40s.  He had three to four of these epidoses, each
lasting approximately one minute.  Patient's heart rate improved
spontaneously, he did not require any atropine.  On transfer,
patient was in sinus tach at 110 with SBP of 130.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient feels comfortable, but endorses
some intermittent dyspnea. No chest pain. He has an NG tube in
place draining dark brown/red fluid.  He denies abdominal, pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

MICROBIOLOGY:
Blood cultures x3: NGTD
Urine culture: no growth
Lyme serologies: NO ANTIBODY TO B. BURGDORFERI DETECTED BY EIA.

IMAGING:
TTE ([**12-8**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal (the posterior wall is thin, fibrotic,
and akinetic). The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2124-11-30**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
further reduced secondary to more extensive inferior and
posterior wall dysfunction.

CXR:
With the chin elevated, the tip of the endotracheal tube is at
the upper
margin of the clavicles, no less than 6 cm from the carina,
probably an
acceptable position. The tube could be advanced 15 mm for a more
secure
seating. There is no pulmonary edema. Mild atelectasis at the
left base is new. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5661**] is a 68 year-old male with history of AV nodal
blockade, HTN, DM, prior IMI with systolic CHF (EF 35%), h/o GIB
(unclear etiology), presenting with dyspnea, hematemesis
secondary to upper GIB as well as myocardial ischemia in setting
of GIB.
.
# GI Bleed: Upper GI bleed demonstrated by hematemesis and NG
lavage with bloody fluid.  He was initially given 2 units pRBCs
and 1 L IVF with improvement in hemodynamics.  Patient with
evidence of active end organ ischemia given troponin elevation,
ST changes on EKG, and elevated lactate. Patient received a
total of 8 units pRBC as well as one FFP and platelet
transfusion. GI saw the patient and performed an endoscopy
twice. The first did not provide adequate visualization due to
significant bleeding. The second endoscopy visualized vascular
lesion consistent with Dieulafoy lesion and was clipped. Post
procedure the patient remained hemodynamically stable with
stable Hct and did not require any further transfusions. His
hematocrit remained stable on the floor and his PPI was
transitioned from IV to PO.  He had a repeat endoscopy on day of
discharge that showed barretts. Biopsies were taken. He is to
have repeat EGD in [**6-21**] weeks.

.
# Myocardial ischemia: Patient with likely demand ischemia in
setting of GIB, without chest pain.  Patient with troponin
elevation during prior hospitalization in the setting of renal
failure. A repeat TTE was performed and compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-11-30**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is further reduced
secondary to more extensive inferior and posterior wall
dysfunction. Atrius Cardiology evaluated the patient. Beta
blocker was initially held during acute GI bleed, but then
restarted once he was stable. His
