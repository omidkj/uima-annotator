HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89-year-old
female nursing home resident with severe dementia and
nonverbal who was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory
failure.

She has a history of recurrent aspiration.  Thought to have
aspirated on [**12-23**] and was started on Levaquin.
Overnight, on [**12-24**] to [**12-25**], she had increasing
respiratory distress and decreased saturations to 78% on 4
liters oxygen.  Following a family discussion, they wanted a
full code and aggressive resuscitation.  The patient had an
arterial blood gas on 100% nonrebreather that was
7.16/88/274, intubated with thick copious sputum suctioned.
A chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure,
and the patient was given some Lasix 40 mg intravenously in
the Emergency Department.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Stroke in [**2162**].
 2.  Hypertension.
 3.  Coronary artery disease with congestive heart failure.
 4.  Severe dementia; noncommunicative at baseline.
 5.  Seizure disorder.
 6.  DJ?
 7.  Hyponatremia.
 8.  Peritonitis.
 9.  Right hip open reduction/internal fixation in [**2163**].
10.  Prior percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
complicated by peritonitis after the patient
self-discontinued percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Promote with fiber 85 cc per hour (for 15 hours per day).
2.  Metoprolol 50 mg by mouth twice per day.
3.  Ranitidine 150 mg by mouth twice per day.
4.  Diltiazem 60 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Hydralazine 30 mg by mouth four times per day.
6.  Levofloxacin 500 mg once per day.
7.  Water flushes 500 q.4h.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a nursing home resident.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination, the
patient was intubated, her temperature was 98.2, her pulse
was 70, her blood pressure was 113/69, her respiratory rate
was 16, and her oxygen saturation was 100% on ventilator.
Intubated with copious secretions from endotracheal tube.
The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation bilateral.  Conjunctivae were muddy.  The neck
was supple and soft.  There was no lymphadenopathy.  No
jugular venous distention.  A regular rate and rhythm.
Normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  No
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Occlusion ectopy.  Coarse
rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally (right greater than
left) anteriorly.  No wheezes.  No crackles.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Percutaneous endoscopic
jejunostomy in place, site was clean.  Extremities revealed
1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.  Faint palpable dorsalis pedis
pulses on the left.  Trace bilateral pedal pitting edema.
The left foot was slightly cool.  Rectal examination was
guaiac-negative per Emergency Department.  On neurologic
examination, the patient withdrew to pain.  Skin had no
rashes or lesions.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Her white blood
cell count was 14, her hematocrit was 38, and her platelets
were 330.  Her INR was 1.1.  Her partial thromboplastin time
was 27.  Sodium was 128, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 91,
bicarbonate was 2.8, blood urea nitrogen was 28, creatinine
was 0.7, and her blood glucose was 296.  Arterial blood gas
on nonrebreather prior to intubation was 7.16/88/274.  Her
differential revealed 91% neutrophils, 5% lymphocytes, and 3%
monocytes.  Her lactate was 1.6.  Urinalysis had 30 to 14
trace glucose, and 21 to 50 white blood cells, 0 to 2
granular casts.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed good
placement of endotracheal tube, mild pulmonary vascular
congestion; improved compared to prior intubation chest
x-ray.  Mild left lower lobe atelectasis, infiltrate, with
small pleural effusion.

An electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 78
with premature atrial contractions and slight left axis
deviation.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

 1.  HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was
intubated.  She was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl
intravenously for her aspiration pneumonia from aspiration on
[**12-23**].  Her congestive heart failure was likely also
contributing to her respiratory failure and was diuresed with
intravenous Lasix.  Likely bronchospasm was also treated with
ipratropium inhalers around the clock and as needed.

She grew gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters from her
sputum and completed a 7-day course of antibiotics.  The
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus in her sputum was
not treated.

The patient required frequent suctioning.  She was extubated
on [**2170-12-31**].  She was transferred to the floor on
[**2171-1-1**] on a face mask with frequent suctioning.
She was saturating 90% to 95% on room air on the floor,
requiring some suctioning.

 2.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was
diuresed with intravenous Lasix which was converted to by
mouth.  Her dose was 80 mg by mouth once per day on the
floor.  The patient was euvolemic on discharge.  No further
diuresis.

 3.  BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL ISSUES:  The patient was
restarted on her diltiazem, and nitroglycerin, as well as
hydralazine, and metoprolol.

 4.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient has a
history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction.
Negative troponin levels and positive creatine kinases.  Her
blood pressure was controlled with her medications.  She was
not on aspirin given her history of a gastrointestinal bleed
in the past with a decreased hematocrit.  She was on a beta
blocker, hydralazine, nitrate, and Lasix.

 5.  DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS ISSUES:  The patient had right
peripherally inserted central catheter placed for intravenous
access when she was intubated.  She was noted to have right
upper extremity edema greater than left.  On ultrasound she
had a brachial artery deep venous thrombosis around the
peripherally inserted central catheter.  The peripherally
inserted central catheter was discontinued on [**2171-1-1**], and no further anticoagulation was felt to be necessary
given deep venous thrombosis associated with the line in the
upper extremities.

 6.  CODE STATUS ISSUES:  The patient remained full code
throughout her hospitalization.  Per discussion with her
primary care physician (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) and multiple other
staff and the family, the patient was full code.

 7.  HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient had a stable
hematocrits since initial admission hemoconcentration.  Iron
studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.

 8.  URINARY TRACT INFECTION ISSUES:  The patient was treated
with levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.
Urinary tract infection was covered by her Levaquin.

 9.  HYPONATREMIA ISSUES:  Hyponatremia corrected after Lasix
and intravenous fluids on admission.  Likely secondary to
hyperglycemia and pseudohyponatremia.  Free water flushes
from the tube feeds were held.

10.  HYPERGLYCEMIA ISSUES:  The patient had an hemoglobin A1c
check which was around 5 and was covered with an insulin
sliding-scale.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Metoprolol 50 mg by mouth twice per day.
 2.  Hydralazine 25 mg by mouth q.6h.
 3.  Lansoprazole 30 mg by mouth once per day.
 4.  Subcutaneous heparin 5000 units subcutaneously q.8h.
 5.  Insulin sliding-scale.
