Service:  [**Location (un) **] Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fatigue.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to
the Medicine Service from the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

An 84-year-old female admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] MICU [**2114-11-24**] after being found by
VNA on [**2114-11-21**] being somnolent, fatigued, and
lightheaded when standing.  The patient denied any melena,
bright red blood per rectum, hematemesis, hemoptysis,
hematuria, abdominal pain.  She was found to have an elevated
BUN-creatinine ratio and hematocrit of 19 with her baseline
of 30, and the patient was taken to [**Hospital6 27253**], where she had guaiac positive brown stool, and
nasogastric lavage was negative.

The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.  Upon
arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], she was
hemodynamically stable, in-fact somewhat hypertensive.  She
was guaiac negative at [**Hospital1 69**].
In the MICU, she was transfused 2 units of packed red blood
cells with an appropriate hematocrit increase to 24.  She
required 40 mg of intravenous Lasix between the units of
blood for some mild congestive heart failure.  Her resting
heart rate was in the 40s, so her beta blocker was held, and
hydralazine was titrated up for blood pressure control.

Her Coumadin was held as well, and INR allowed to drift down.
She remained hemodynamically stable for 24 hours, and was
transferred to the Medical floor for further management.

1. Stroke in [**2114-9-28**] with residual left sided
weakness.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 84-year-old female with multiple
medical problems admitted with increased fatigue and found to
have a hematocrit of 19 down from her baseline 30 with
guaiac-positive stool and negative nasogastric lavage at an
outside hospital.  She was initially admitted to the MICU,
and subsequently transferred to the floor.

1. Gastrointestinal bleed:  Initially, there was a question
of whether or not this patient had a GI bleed with a guaiac
positive stool at an outside hospital, but no history of
frank melena or hematemesis, and her most recent stool guaiac
negative.  The patient was transfused again when she got to
the floor, two more units to have her hematocrit above 30
with her history of coronary artery disease, the next day it
was noted that her hematocrit had dropped from 32 to 25, and
that she did pass a large melanotic stool.

At this time, she again was transfused above 30 and did
maintain at this level throughout the rest of her
hospitalization.  She had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy done
at that time which did not show any active bleeding from her
stomach or proximal duodenum.  It did show duodenal
diverticulosis.

The patient did have a past history of a Dieulafoy's lesion
in the past as seen by her outside hospital medical records,
this was not seen during her esophagogastroduodenoscopy
during this visit.  It was thought that most likely her bleed
was from a diverticulum in the setting of patient having a
high INR.

Her INR on transfer to the floor from the MICU was 3.2 after
having her Coumadin held.  Coumadin was held for the next few
days with no drop in her INR.  In-fact, it increased to 3.9
over the next three days.  This was thought secondary to poor
nutritional status.  In the setting of her hematocrit dropped
and melanotic stools seen on the floor, her anticoagulation
was reversed with vitamin K and 2 units of fresh-frozen
plasma.  Her hematocrit remained stable for the remainder of
the hospitalization after reversal of her anticoagulation.

2. Cardiovascular:  1. Coronary artery disease:  The patient
does have a history of coronary artery disease with a nonST
segment elevation myocardial infarction three years ago.  She
did not have any symptoms of angina during this
hospitalization.  She was maintained on her antihypertensives
which were increased with her refractory hypertension.

2. Pump:  An echocardiogram was obtained on Ms. [**Known lastname **] in
order to evaluate her wide pulse pressures for the question
of aortic insufficiency, although she did not have a murmur.
This study showed a normal systolic function and normal
valves with only 1+ aortic regurgitation and 1+ mitral
regurgitation.  There was a dilated left atrium and severe
pulmonary hypertension.  It was thought that this pulmonary
hypertension might be secondary to the patient being in some
congestive heart failure after receiving blood transfusions.

3. Rhythm:  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation
and in the setting of her Lopressor being held for prolonged
P-R and bradycardia to the 40s, she did develop one episode
of rapid ventricular response, atrial fibrillation to the
120s.  She was restarted on her Lopressor at this time, and
had a controlled rate.  She had no other episodes of rapid
atrial fibrillation after this.

4. Hypertension:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] continued to have severe
hypertension with systolic blood pressures in the 190s-low
200s during her stay here.  This was despite increase of her
Hydralazine to 100 qid, restarting of the Lopressor.
Continuation of her Cozaar 100 q day and starting the patient
on amlodipine.  Her nitropatch, which had been held on
admission in the setting of bleed was also restarted and her
blood pressure still remained in the high 180s to 190s.  Ms.
