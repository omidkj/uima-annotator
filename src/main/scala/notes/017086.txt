been started on Vancomycin at [**Hospital1 **] and had been bolused with
IVFs and then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. In the ED she was febrile to
101.8 and cxray suggested pulmonary edema. She was diuresed with
acute drop in his blood pressure which then normalized on its
own. He was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.

He continued to have diarrhea and stool culture was positive for
c.diff. He was started on Flagyl.
