History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F who presented to OSH with abdominal pain, primarily in

2, blood cultures, ertapenem 1 gm IV x 1.

The patient developed the pain yesterday afternoon and it
continued to get worse throughout the evening.  Of note, she had
a similar episode about 3-4 weeks ago, though did not last as
long.  At that time, she had abdominal pain, nausea, and dry

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2193-3-20**] 10:19 AM
FINDINGS:

The left subclavian PICC line placed had its tip in the internal
jugular vein portion of the neck. The heart size is top normal.
Bibasilar opacities secondary to effusion atelectasis are seen.

IMPRESSION:

1. The left subclavian PICC line tip needs to be adjusted as it
is in the neck portion of the left internal jugular vein.

2. Bibasilar effusion and atelectasis. Small-to-moderate in
amount are noted. This information was communicated by phone to
the nurse who introduced the PICC line.
==================
ERCP
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: Prominent major papilla
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with
a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.

Biliary Tree: Cholangiogram showed multiple stones in the CBD.
The CBD was dilated to 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were
minimally dilated. The cystic duct did not fill.
Pancreas: Limited pancreatogram in the head of the pancreas
during biliary cannulation appeared normal.
Procedures: 1. A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
2. Multiple stones were extracted with a balloon catheter

Impression: 1. Prominent major papilla
2. Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
3. Cholangiogram showed multiple stones in the CBD. The CBD was
dilated to 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated.
The cystic duct did not fill.
4. Limited pancreatogram in the head of the pancreas during
biliary cannulation appeared normal.
5. A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position
using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.Pus and sludge
was seen to flow after sphincterotomy.
6. Multiple stones were extracted with a balloon catheter

Recommendations: Juices today when awake, alert and at baseline
Continue IV antibiotics
Remain on antibiotics for total of 7 days

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with h/o HTN, anxiety, gout, who presents with
abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting with RUQ revealing
cholecystitis with obstructing stone and CBD dilatation.

1) Cholangitis: Likely the patient's pain a few weeks ago was
also secondary to passing a gallstone.  Her symptoms, fever, and
exam are all consistent with cholangitis.  S/p ERCP with
sphincterotomy, removal of stones and passage of purulent fluid.
 Pt now bacteremic with GNRs, likely biliary source.  Marked
Leukocytosis with 10% bandemia.  IV ciprofloxacin and flagyl
initiated [**3-16**], recommend 14 day course in light of bacteremia.
PICC placed for IV abx at rehab.  Ms. [**Known lastname 17204**] improved rapidly
after ERCP and was transferred to the medical floor without any
additional complications.  She remained afebrile and her
obstructive biliary labs improved daily.  The surgical team
evaluated her for cholecystectomy, which she and her family do
not wish to pursue at this time.

2)Hypotension.  Had held anti-hypertensive meds peri ERCP.  In
ERCP suite pt became hypotensive in the setting of receiving
propofol, dexmedetomidate. Temporarily placed on peripheral neo
for procedure and transfer to floor.  Bolused throughout the day
and evening with improvement, MAPs ~60-65.  UOP stayed around
30cc/hour.  Pt without complaint.  Mentating well the entire
time.  Sepsis/shock secondary to biliary sepsis.  After transfer
to floor, home antihypertensives reiniitated without difficulty.

3)Cardiac pauses/AV block -- She had three episodes of
documented [**1-25**] second pauses on telemetry.  She received one
dose of amiodarone in the ICU for rapid atrial fibrillation that
may have contributed to her arrhythmias.  She was asymptomatic.
Pacer placement was
