Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to CC7.  On the medicine floor, he was ruled out
for myocardial infarction with serial enzymes. He was
orthostatic and his hypotension initially improved with fluid
rehydration. A fever work up including UA, cultures, CXR, and LP
was started and has so far been inconclusive. Serum tox screen
negative. He had a head CT without any obvious intracranial
bleed or mass; some maxiallary sinus mucosal thickening was
noted. He was started on antibiotics the evening of [**2112-7-29**], when
he was spiking fevers with altered MS; he was started
empirically on vanco/levo/flagyl. His WBC had trended down and
his fevers were intermittent (Tmx: 102). He developed atrial
fibrillation with RVR on the floor; his rate was controlled with
lopressor, at the expense of his BP. He also became more
tachypnic, breathing 40/min while sleeping, with ABG 7.41/29/91
on 3L nc.

He was transferred to the MICU. A work up for his change in
mental status resulted in a repeat negative head CT, an abnormal
EEG which showed changes consistent with metabolic
abnormalities, infection, ischemia or anxiety, an unrevealing
second LP, a negative RPR, B12 of 289 and TSH of 1.0. He was
treated with Zyprexa and Ativan for agitation and placed on the
CIWA protocol. His Atrial Fibrillation was treated with
Lopressor, Amiodarone, and Heparin and Warfarin. An
Echocardiogram showed no vegetations. Due to increased wheezing,
he was started on albuterol nebs and inhaled fluticasone with an
improvement in his tachypnea and wheezing. His WBC continued to
trend downwards and his blood pressure stabilized. Antibiotics
were continued.

On [**2112-8-2**] he was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 7 for further
management.

1. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR has remained stable
with HR ranging from 90-125.  He was started on Amiodarone HCl
400 mg PO starting [**2112-8-1**], and his home dose of Metoprolol was
increased from 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 75 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Heparin on and sliding
scale and Warfarin 2.5 mg PO were begun [**2112-8-2**] with an
increase in Warfarin to 5 mg PO daily on [**2112-8-4**] since the INR
remained low at 1.3. Lovenox 90 mg [**Hospital1 **] SC was begun [**2112-8-4**] at
6 PM and heparin discontinued in anticipation of discharge. INR
upon discharge 1.3.  Home VNA will help administer Lovenox.

2. CHANGES IN MENTAL STATUS
A work up for his change in mental status resulted in a negative
head CT, an abnormal EEG which showed changes consistent with
metabolic abnormalities, infection, ischemia or anxiety, two
unrevealing LPs, a negative RPR, B12 of 289 and TSH of 1.0. He
was treated with Zyprexa and Ativan and placed on the CIWA
protocol for concerns about possible alcohol withdrawal. The
patient's mental status improved during his hospital stay with
more difficulties at night.  He was fully alert and oriented
with a mini-mental status score of 27/30 with only some
difficulty on fine points of orientation including the floor of
the hospital he was on, the county we were in, and the date the
day before discharge.

3. FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN
At discharge, the patient was afebrile with a WBC of 9.4, down
from 16.0 upon admission.  ID believes he had a viral infection
which has resolved. He was treated with Levofloxacin for 6 days,
and Vancomycin and Flagyll for 5 days during his
hospitalization.

4. DYSPNEA
The patient improved with a RR of 22, an oxygen saturation of
95% on room air, and lungs CTAB upon discharge.  The dyspena is
believed to be due to COPD although the patient only has a
remote history of smoking.  A Chest/Abdominal/Pelvic CT
concluded "1.Prominent mediastinal fat likely corresponds to the
widened appearance of the mediastinum on chest radiograph.  On
this study limited by patient motion
artifact and suboptimal contrast bolus timing, there is no
evidence of aortic
dissection, aneurysm, or central pulmonary embolism. 2.
Posterior dependent atelectatic changes and minimal bilateral
pleural, effusions. 3.  Right renal lesions incompletely
characterized, but likely cysts. 4.  Prostatic enlargement.  3.8
cm cystic area of right prostate is of uncertain signficance and
clinical correlation is suggested."

During this hospitalization he was treated with Albuterol 0.083%
nebs every four hours, fluticasone propionate 110 mcg 4 puffs
inhaled [**Hospital1 **] and Albuterol 0.083% 1-2 nebs inhaled every [**1-30**]
hours PRN. He will be discharged on Spiriva, Combivent and
Albuterol for presumed C
