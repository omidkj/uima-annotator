Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1572**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transesophageal Echocardiography on [**2114-1-31**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 62215**] is a 56 year old male s/p renal xplant '[**90**] (b/l Cr
3.0), AVR for AS '[**09**] p/w 2-3 weeks of gradual dyspnea on
exertion and orthopnea. His exercise tolerance has drastically
decreased as well. He was previously able to walk 1 mile
5x/week, however recently he has become dyspneic with walking
from the bed to the bathroom. He notes that the shortness of
breath has been gradually increasing and has made it difficult
for him to sleep. He went to see his Cardiologist for these
complaints last week. His symptoms persisted until last night
when he had to sleep sitting up secondary to shortness of breath
with lying flat. He also reports a nonproductive cough and
denies fevers. He had increased LE edema, although attributes
this to his Nifedipine which has historically resulted in LE
edema. This AM prior to presentation he was unable to ambulate
around the house without dyspnea. He had no chest pain.

In the ED on arrival his VS were BP 209/125, HR 86, O2sat 77% on
RA. Exam was notable for ??. He was given 100mg IV lasix and
started on Bipap. He was given 20mg IV hydralazine and started
on a nitro gtt. He put out 500cc of urine in the 2 hours in the
ED. CXR showed evidence of heart failure. A bedside US showed no
evidence of pericardial effusion but ? global hypokinesis. Labs
were notable for Cr 2.9 which is his baseline, BNP 70,000. EKG
with sinus rhythm no ST or TW changes.

On transfer to the CCU, the patient is saturating 97% on NRB. He
is comfortable.

CXR ([**1-28**]): There is cardiomegaly with hilar congestion and
alveolar opacities compatible with pulmonary edema. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are also noted.

TTE ([**1-29**]): Severe LVH with moderate LV dilatation. Moderate to
severe global LV hypokinesis with inferior akinesis.
Bioprosthetic AVR with very high gradients (mean 49). Unable to
assess if vegetation or thrombus on aortic valve. At least
moderate mitral regurgitation (UNDERestimated due to shadowing).
Diastolic dysfunction with moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2114-1-9**], overall LV systolic function has decreased
significantly. The gradient across the aortic prosthesis is
slighlty higher. The other findings are similar.

Renal transplant U/S ([**1-29**]): 1. No hydronephrosis of the renal
transplant.
2. Unremarkable renal transplant Doppler examination with only
slightly
elevated resistive indices but unremarkable waveforms.
3. Atrophy of both the native kidneys which make them unable to
be imaged on this exam.

TEE ([**1-31**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior wall hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45
%). There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
prosthetic aortic valve leaflets are thickened. There is
moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8 cm2) by
planimetry. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Thickened and calcified bioprosthetic aortic valve
struts and leaflets. Moderate to severe prosthetic aortic valve
stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure:
Elevated BNP, history and exam consistent with CHF. Likely
precipitated by AS and HTN, and TTE showed worsened systolic
function (which improved after diuresis) and increased aortic
valve gradient. He also had a slightly elevated troponin likely
in the setting of demand given normal CK-MB. He was diuresed
with lasix IV in 100mg boluses with improvement in symptoms and
was weaned off oxygen. He was restarted on his home dose of
160mg PO lasix daily, although this made the patient appear
volume depleted so was decreased to 80mg daily.

2) Hypertensive emergency: No evidence of renal artery stenosis
on doppler study. Initially required a nitroglycerin drip.
Hydralazine was used for intermittent hypertensive episodes. He
was restarted on clonidine 0.1mg PO BID, nifedepine 60mg CR was
switched from qam to qhs, metoprolol and valsartan continued,
and lisinopril stopped secondary to cough. His BP was well
controlled after these changes.

3) Acute on chronic renal failure s/p renal transplant: Baseline
creatinine 3.0. Had bump to 3.8. Transplant renal ultrasound was
unremarkable. Nephrology was consulted and felt this was due to
his chronic nephropathy and volume shifts. His immunosuppresant
regimen, calcitriol, and sensipar were continued and his
creatinine was trending down at discharge. Renagel was added per
nephrology recommendations.

4) Aortic valve stenosis: TEE showed mod-severe AS with a valve
area of 0.8. He will likely need valve replacement and was seen
by cardiac surgery, but surgery will be scheduled for a
subsequent admission. He was instructed to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks. He will likely need chest CT and cardiac
cath prior to AVR per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

5) Blurred vision left eye: started in last few weeks per pt.
Opthamology saw pt and noted a blurred optic disc. They
recommended continuing ASA 81 mg, checking ESR (63), and f/u
with optho in 2 weeks (booked).
