HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year old
female with a history of hypertension, breast cancer and
colon cancer, who presented to the Emergency Department with
a four hour history of substernal chest pain and was found to
have anterior lead ST segment elevation and was seen by
cardiology at which time ACS protocol was undertaken and the
patient was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory.  She was tried for a first period on the cool
myocardial infarction protocol but this was aborted with the
finding of a severe three vessel disease with an ejection
fraction of 35 percent and cardiothoracic surgery service was
consulted after placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump.
Her cardiac catheterization showed that she had one plus
mitral regurgitation with 35 percent left ventricular
ejection fraction and severe inferior, anterolateral and
apical hypokinesis.  The angiography showed distal tapering
of 60 to 70 percent of left main coronary artery and proximal
ulceration with 90 percent stenosis of the left anterior
descending coronary artery and the left circumflex also had
90 percent ostial stenosis with 50 percent proximal stenosis
of the right circumflex.  At the time, the patient was seen
by the cardiac surgery service, she was afebrile and
otherwise was hemodynamically stable.  She was on Integrilin.
Her sclerae were anicteric and her conjunctivae were pink.
The neck had no lymphadenopathy.  The lungs were clear
bilaterally.  Otherwise, there was evidence of a radical
mastectomy.  The patient's heart was regular without a rub or
murmur.  Her extremities had no significant varicosities.
The remainder of the examination was unobtainable secondary
to the patient being draped during her cardiac
catheterization.  Her preoperative hematocrit was 32.0 with
blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 20 and 0.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken urgently for a
coronary artery bypass grafting times two on [**2198-7-20**].  She
had saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending coronary
artery bypass, saphenous vein graft to ramus bypass.  Her
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 56 minutes with a cross clamp
time of 41 minutes.  She was transferred to Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit on Levophed, Aprotinin and Propofol drips.  The
patient was initially unable to extubate secondary to apneic
episodes but at the end of postoperative day number one, she
was able to wean to extubation.  Her intra-aortic balloon
pump was also discontinued at this time and her vasopressor
drips were weaned.  By postoperative day three, the patient
was off all her vasopressor drips.  She remained in the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit with some respiratory issues
and was noted to have decrease in oxygen saturation over the
course of postoperative days number four and five at which
time a chest x-ray showed moderate left pleural effusion.
She was being given Lasix but continued to have some
respiratory issues secondary to the pleural effusion.
Therefore, she underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2198-7-26**], to
assess for any sort of bronchial plugging or lobar collapse.
This showed a clear airway with only thin secretions.  Given
the fact that her respiratory status continued to be her main
issue, a left chest tube was placed at which time about 300
to 400 milliliters of serosanguinous fluid were removed.  The
patient's respiratory status improved significantly after
this.  She did have intermittent episodes of atrial
fibrillation postoperatively.  These were controlled with
Amiodarone and beta blockade and she did convert
spontaneously into a sinus rhythm.  Notably, the insertion of
her chest tube was complicated by a pneumothorax but this
improved gradually with suction.  Otherwise, the remainder of
the patient's postoperative stay in the Cardiac Surgery
Intensive Care Unit was essentially for her atrial
fibrillation and maintenance of blood pressure which was
somewhat labile given her conversion of rhythms and also
secondary to some hypovolemia for which she was given fluid.
By postoperative day number twelve, she was off all
vasopressor drips, was in sinus rhythm, was maintaining a
good blood pressure and it was felt that she was safe for
transfer to the floor as she was hemodynamically stable and
rehabilitation screen was started.  The remainder of her
hospitalization was essentially remarkable only for an
episode of bradycardia to the 40s and sinus bradycardia which
was thought to be secondary to a combination of her dose of
Amiodarone and Lopressor.  Her rate significantly improved
into the 60s after her Amiodarone and beta blocker doses were
adjusted.  Otherwise, there was no evidence of any ischemia
subsequently on her electrocardiograms and she only had small
bilateral pleural effusions which were not significantly
affecting her respiratory status.  She continued to receive
physical therapy without any other major events until
postoperative day sixteen at which time a rehabilitation bed
was found for her.  Prior to discharge, the patient's
hematocrit was 30.5 and otherwise her platelet count was
419,000.  Her blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 35 and
1.1.
