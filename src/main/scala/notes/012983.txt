Renal ultrasound [**2193-6-9**]: No evidence of hydronephrosis or renal
calculi on this limited examination.

Bilateral foot radiographs [**2193-6-9**]: No definite radiographic
evidence of osteomyelitis. If there is high clinical suspicion,
an MRI is recommended.

CXR (portable AP) [**2193-6-9**]: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion
and probable small bilateral pleural effusions in the setting of
low lung volumes.

EGD:
Impression: Erosions in the antrum
Ulcer in the antrum (biopsy)
Friability in the fundus
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results
GI bleeding likely due to antral ulcer. Cont PPI [**Hospital1 **] until
repeat EGD in 8 weeks. If possible, stop ASA (defer to primary
team). If not, will need to remain on PPI indefinitely (can
decrease to daily pending results of repeat EGD). Await bxs for
H pylori. If pos, pls treat, and check breath test in 8 weeks
for proof of eradication. pls arrange for repeat EGD (8 weeks)
upon discharge.

ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Dilated aortic sinus.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo F presents with coffee ground emesis found to have acute
on chronic renal failure.  She had an EGD performed that
revealed gastric ulcer but no active bleeding.  She had
downtrending HCT following the EGD (30--25).  Pt transfused one
unit and post-transfusion HCT 32.8 and was stable on subsequent
check.

# Upper GI Bleeding / Acute blood loss anemia / Gastric ulcer:
Patient initially admitted to the ICU until she demonstrated HCT
stability.  She was treated with Pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **].  EGD
diagnosed gastric ulcer.  Transfusion of 1 unit PRBC with stable
post-tranfusion HCT.

ASA was stopped and continued to be held at discharge. Biopsies
taken in EGD and tests including H. Pylori pending at the time
of discharge.  Discharge HCT 32.9.

# [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.  Baseline Cr 1.5.  On admission, Cr 4.6 with FENa
2.2% and FEUrea 21% with most likely etiology pre-renal from
hypovolemia potentially in setting of GIB. Renal ultrasound
showed no hydronephrosis. Diuretics and cozaar were held. The
patient was given multiple fluid boluses for low urine output
with some improvement in her creatinine.  Renal was consulted,
and her urine sediment was bland.  Given her lab studies, we
continued with fluid resuscitation and sh
