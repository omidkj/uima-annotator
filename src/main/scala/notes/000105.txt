Brief Hospital Course:
35 yo F w/significant psych Hx and multiple suicide attempts,
admitted unresponsive, presumably after OD. (Most likely
Fioricet.)  Now extubated, off pressors.
.
1) Tylenol Overdose: Level 267 on admission, decreased to 0
within 24h.  In the ED she received activated charcoal and
mucomyst 10g PO. Mucomyst was continued for 11 doses total
(stopped when LFTs showed no sign of increase above normal).
Coags and LFTs remained wnl.  Mucomyst then discontinued.
.
CXR suggested pneumonia, possibly related to aspiration, so
clinda was started.  Mental status improved and the patient was
extubated on HD #2.
.
2) Barbiturate Overdose: Pt was found unresponsive and intubated
in the field.  By HD #2 mental status was improving and pt was
extubated.  By the time of discharge mental status was normal.
Pt was kept on a CIWA scale and monitored for signs of
withdrawal throughout hospital course.  Vital signs remained
stable.
.
3) Hypotension: Initially hypotensive with SBP in the 60s.  On
levophed for BP support with good response, but then weaned off
after fluid resuscitation.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test had an inadequate
bump, but hypotension had already resolved so steroids were not
started.  Monitored bp which remained stable and was 115/79 on
day of discharge.
.
4) Aspiration pneumonia: Bibasilar consolidation noted on CXR.
Will continue treatment with clindamycin for 7 days (day [**1-8**]).
.
5) Asthma: Continued inhalers.
.
6) Psych/suicide attempt: Psychiatry followed patient during
hospital stay.  Pt had a 1:1 sitter throughout hospital course.

psychiatric hospitalization for suicide attempt after discharge
from medical service now that patient is medically cleared.

PTT then normalized.

psychiatric care.  She is afebrile, temp 97.2, heart rate 68, bp
117/79 and oxygen saturation 97% on room air.  Her Tylenol level
