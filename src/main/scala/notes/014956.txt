HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old male
with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
schizophrenia and hypertension who was transferred from
[**Hospital3 105**] for evaluation of tracheal stenosis. He was
admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Doctor First Name **] on [**12-23**] with respiratory
failure, secondary to Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus pneumonia. He required endotracheal intubation and was
treated with Vancomycin.  The patient self extubated on
[**12-31**]. He was initially on face mask but progressive
hypercapnia led to non invasive ventilatory support and
eventually to endotracheal intubation.  Tracheostomy was
performed on [**1-7**] by ENT at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Doctor First Name **] with a
Shiley #8, placed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 54241**].  He was transferred to
[**Hospital **] Rehabilitation on [**1-10**].

At rehabilitation, he was noted to have difficulty with
weaning, with very high respiratory pressure resistance
during suction.  Bronchoscopy on [**1-17**] showed a 90%
occlusion with granulation tissue at the distal tip.  The
patient was transferred, therefore, to [**Hospital1 190**] for evaluation and treatment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
prior to transfer back to [**Hospital1 **] for the weaning.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Schizophrenia. Hypertension.  Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia in [**2187-12-8**],
complicated by respiratory failure, intubation, tracheostomy
and tracheal stenosis.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
Vancomycin one gram intravenous q. 24 hours.
Lisinopril 24 mg q. day.
Theophylline 100 mg three times a day.
K-Phos one pack q. 8 hours.
Lorazepam 1 mg q. six hours prn.
Reglan 10 mg three times a day.
Elanzepine 10 mg q h.s.
Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q h.s.
Amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q. day.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebs prn.
Fluticasone 2 puffs twice a day.
Heparin subcutaneously twice a day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a nursing home resident with a positive
smoking history. The patient has a brother-in-law who has
been making decisions for him, by the name of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 20473**].
He is currently incapacitated.  Therefore, the patient has a
niece named [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4223**], contact #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 54242**].  She has
been very involved in his care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  Alert and responsive on
trach ventilation.  Vital signs:  Temperature 100.8; pulse
116 and regular; blood pressure 115/74; respiratory rate of
23.  Oxygen saturation 92% on 35% FI02.  HEAD, EYES, EARS,
NOSE AND THROAT:  Normal cephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal
round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact.
Neck:  Tracheostomy without purulent drainage.  Lungs:
Diffuse upper airway wheezes. Cardiovascular regular rate and
rhythm; distant heart sounds; normal S1 and S2.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube without discharge or erythema.  Extremities:
No edema, 2+ pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 11.1 with 14% eosinophils;
hematocrit of 31.8; platelets of 303.  Sodium of 142;
potassium of 4.0; chloride 101; bicarbonate of 35; BUN 23;
creatinine 1.0; glucose 98.  Calcium 8.2; phosphorus 2.8; INR
of 1.3.

Chest x-ray showed bilateral combined alveolar interstitial
pattern, most likely due to pulmonary edema with bilateral
pleural effusions.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] Intensive Care Unit on [**2188-1-18**] for evaluation and treatment of his tracheal stenosis
with granulation tissue.  It was noted on discharge summary
from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Doctor First Name **] that his Vancomycin was to be
continued from [**1-14**], however, it appears that he was
continued on Vancomycin at the rehabilitation hospital.
Given that he has no signs of ongoing infection, Vancomycin
was discontinued on admission.  It was noted that he had a
peripheral eosinophilia; therefore, quarantine laboratory
studies were sent including a sedimentation rate, anca and
PSA.  However, his rate was 75, anca was unremarkable and PSA
was within normal limits, therefore, not revealing a cause of
his eosinophilia.

At the time of discharge, his eosinophils had decreased to
14% and it was felt that the ongoing work-up for his
eosinophilia can be done back at the rehabilitation hospital.

On [**1-21**], he was taken to the operating room by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] for rigid bronchoscopy.  Bronchoscopy revealed
large posterior tracheal ulceration with granulation tissue
that was supra stomal.  The granulation tissue at the stoma
was excised and sent to pathology.  In addition, he had a
tracheal revision with removal of the necrotic tracheal ring.
There were no complications during this procedure and he was
observed overnight in the Intensive Care Unit without any
complications.  The following morning, he was sent back to
[**Hospital3 105**] for further respiratory weaning.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Tracheal stenosis.
Eosinophilia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Same as on admission, with the exception of Vancomycin.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  He is discharged to [**Hospital3 105**] in
good condition for continued weaning from the ventilator.
