History of Present Illness:
50yo woman with a history of peptic ulcer disease and GERD s/p
Nissen fundoplication in [**2160-3-15**] who developed an upper GI

been closely followed by the gastroenterology service but on
follow-up has a persistent 1.5-2cm nonhealing type I gastric
ulcer seen on endoscopy, with biopsies negative for malignancy.

Pathology:
Sub-total gastrectomy [**2161-7-21**]: Chronic gastric body ulcer with
marked subjacent submucosal fibrosis and fibrous obliteration of
the muscularis propria, Six reactive lymph nodes (0/6), No
malignancy identified, Gastric corpus mucosa is present at the
proximal resection margin. Stain negative for H.pylori.
Appendectomy [**2161-7-21**]: Fecaliths present; otherwise no diagnostic
abnormalities recognized.
Splenectomy [**2161-7-26**]: Spleen with interrupted capsule and
subcapsular hemorrhage.  The white and red pulp elements are
within normal limits.

Brief Hospital Course:
     This 50yo F was admitted to the MIS surgery service
post-operatively from sub-total gastrectomy with Billroth 2
gastrojejunostomy; please see operative report for details.  An
NGT, Foley catheter, and Epidural anesthetic catheter were in
place.  She was kept in the PACU overnight in extubated
condition; mild hypotension was addressed with adjustment of the
epidural and initiation of PCA.  Further mild hypotension and
tachycardia were addressed with IVF and electrolyte repletion
with success.
     The patient was transferred to the regular floor on POD 1;
a PICC line was placed and TPN initiated.  With scant NGT
output, the tube was removed and clear liquid diet initiated.
This was well tolerated and advanced on POD 3 to full liquid
diet with boost supplements.  A fever to 101.9 warranted
pan-cultures, which were negative.  Intermittent episodes of
sinus tachycardia were noted but with stable and normal blood
pressures and no evidence of hypovolemia.  The pain service
removed the epidural catheter and switched the PCA to oral
medications on POD 4.
     POD 5 was notable when the patient developed severe
abdominal pain with tenderness and distension on exam.
Tachycardia was accompanied now by hypotension.  The hematocrit
was 19 where it previously had been between 28-33.  IVF
resuscitation was initiated with a Foley catheter in place,
although clinical improvement was marginal.  A central line was
placed and the patient was brought emergently to the OR for
concern of post-operative bleeding on POD 5, [**2161-7-26**].  An
exploratory laparotomy revealed a splenic capsule tear and a
splenectomy was performed; please see operative report for
details.  A total of 6 unit of packed red blood cells were
transfused over the pre- and intra-op time period.
     Post-operatively the patient was brought to the SICU in
intubated condition with NGT, Foley, and JP drains in place.
Fluid status was optimized, HCTs remained stable subsequently,
although she remained in sinus tachycardia.  Cardiology consult
was obtained at this time; b-blockade was utilized.  TPN was
restarted.  Ventilator management yielded successful extubation
on POD [**1-20**].  The pre-operative CVL was removed and a new CVL
placed.  She remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred
to the floor on POD [**2-21**].  A PCA was provided for satisfactory
pain relief, diet initiated and advanced progressively.
Physical therapy consult assisted with ambulation, oral
medications begun, and foley catheter eventually discontinued.
An episode of abdominal pain, associated with elevated WBC
count, prompted a CT scan.  No intrabdominal abscess or
infection was found, although a left lower lobe pneumonia was
observed and treated with levaquin and flagyl.
     She continued to have episodes of sinus tachycardia between
100-130, which remained asymptomatic and associated with normal
blood pressures.  With confirmation of euvolemia and adequate
pain control, cardiology and medical consults were instituted
with ultimate transfer to the medical service with the surgery
service following on POD [**8-29**] to expound upon the cardiac
work-up.  This included telemetry, unremarkable echocardiogram,
negative LENI, and a low-probability V-Q scan result.  All
cultures were negative for infection and a suspected nosocomial
pneumonia from earlier in the hospitalization had clinically
resolved.  She was deemed safe for discharge with a Holter
monitor after appropriate follow-up with Surgery, Cardiology,
and Medicine were secured.
