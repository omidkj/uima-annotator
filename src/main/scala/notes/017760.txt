Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 22591**] is a 63-year-old
gentleman, with a history of rheumatic heart disease, who has
had moderate known mitral stenosis which had become
progressively worse with symptoms over the past several
months.  He had a cardiac echo done on [**2192-6-13**] which
showed a markedly dilated left atrium, ejection fraction of
55%, moderately dilated aortic root, and severely thickened
and deformed aortic valve leaflets.  There was noted to be
severe aortic valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets were moderately thickened with
severe mitral annular calcification.  Also, in comparison to
a previous study in [**2191-8-15**], there was noted to be worsened
aortic stenosis with a peak aortic valve gradient of 79 mmHg,
with a mean aortic valve gradient of 54 mmHg, and an aortic
valve area of 0.7.

The patient noted that his dyspnea on exertion over the past
6-8 months had been getting worse, and he denies any episodes
of syncope, presyncope, or chest pain.  He had recently prior
to admission had a work-up for anemia, including a bone
marrow biopsy, which revealed an anemia consistent with his
HIV infection, and iron deficiency due to hemolysis from
damaged cells across the aortic valve.

1. HIV infection.

hepatosplenomegaly, and positive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Show no varicosities, and he has weak pulses
bilaterally.
NEURO EXAM:  Shows him to be alert and oriented x 3 and
grossly intact.
SKIN:  Shows no signs of rash, nor any signs of infection.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  White count 7.4, hematocrit 37%, platelet
count 250,000, sodium 136, potassium 4.0, chloride 98, CO2
29, BUN 18, creatinine 0.8, INR 1.0.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2192-10-11**], the patient underwent
coronary angiography which showed elevated right and left
heart filling pressures with severe pulmonary hypertension,
severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.7 cm2,
and mitral stenosis with a mitral valve area of 1 cm2.  He
had 1+ mitral regurgitation, and ejection fraction of
approximately 50%.  His coronary arteries showed his left
main to have mild disease, his left anterior descending
artery with a 50% stenosis after the second diagonal, and the
second diagonal had an ulcerated 70% stenosis.  His left
circumflex had 90% stenosis in large OM1, and the right
coronary has 70% stenosis at the ostial PDA.  Following the
results of this catheterization, a consult was called to
cardiothoracic surgery service for possible coronary artery
bypass grafting with replacement of aortic and mitral valves.

As part of the patient's preoperative work-up, he was seen by
the dental service who cleared him for surgery.  The
remainder of his preoperative work-up was within normal
limits, and on [**2192-10-12**] he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting x 2 with endoscopically harvested saphenous
vein graft to the OM and endoscopically harvested saphenous
vein graft to the PDA.  He also had aortic valve replacement
with a #19 mm bovine pericardial valve, and a mitral valve
replacement with a #27 [**Company 1543**] mosaic porcine valve.  The
surgery was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 14968**]
with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], PA-C and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NP as assistants.
The surgery was performed under general endotracheal
anesthesia with a total cardiopulmonary bypass time of 225
minutes, with a crossclamp time of 203 minutes.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the
Cardiac Recovery Unit in normal sinus rhythm and on
dobutamine, Levophed and propofol drips.

Upon arrival in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was
noted to be hypoxic with respiratory acidosis requiring Ambu
and 100% FIO2 in order to achieve an SPO2 of greater than
90%.  Consequently, he underwent a bedside bronchoscopy, for
which he had minimal secretions, but a thick white plug was
suctioned.  Following this, his respiratory acidosis did
improve.  Throughout the operative night, he had his
dobutamine weaned, and the Levophed was weaned as tolerated.
By the morning of postoperative day #1, he was weaned to
extubate.  After extubation, his Levophed was able to be
weaned off, although he did require atrial pacing to keep the
systolic blood pressure greater than 90.  The patient
continued to progress and eventually was able to maintain a
blood pressure greater than 90 without pacing, and a heart
rate in the mid to upper 50s to low 60s.  He did remain in
the Intensive Care Unit through postoperative day #3
secondary to unavailability of a bed on the surgical floor.

He was out-of-bed to the chair each day and began work with
cardiac rehab and physical therapy.  He continued with
physical therapy while on the floor, and on postoperative day
#5 his pacing wires were DC'd without incident.  The plan was
for him to be discharged to home on postoperative day #6.

On the evening of postoperative day #5, he went into a rapid
atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response rate in
the 150s.  He was given boluses of IV Lopressor up to a total
of 40 mg, and was started on a diltiazem drip to achieve rate
control.  He also was being given sotalol which was a
preoperative medication and this was increased to 120 mg [**Hospital1 **]
which was his preoperative dose.  He did remain with a heart
rate in the 130s-150s throughout the overnight period despite
increasing the diltiazem drip up to a maximum of 20 mg.

On postoperative day #6, the EP service was consulted, and it
was planned that he would go for cardioversion on that day.
Prior to being taken to the EP Lab for cardioversion, he
spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm with a rate in
the low-60s, and this was following approximately a [**5-19**]
second pause.  He has since maintained normal sinus rhythm at
a rate of 66, and continues on his sotalol 120 mg [**Hospital1 **].  He
has passed to level 5 with physical therapy, having climbed
the stairs, and is ready to be discharged to home today.

DISCHARGE EXAM:  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart - regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  His extremities show no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  His wounds are clean, dry and
intact, and the sternum is stable.

DISCHARGE LABS:  White count 10.1, hematocrit 29.8%,
potassium 4.4, blood glucose 150.  His previous electrolytes
were all within normal limits.  His discharge chest x-ray
shows a very small sliver of a right apical pneumothorax
which has been stable for several days.  Otherwise, his chest
x-ray is clear with no signs of effusion.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.  He will be discharged in good
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease, mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis,
status post aortic valve replacement, mitral valve
replacement, and coronary artery bypass grafting x 2.
2. Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
3. Human immunodeficiency virus in
