ECG Study Date of [**2114-6-26**]  1:50:42 AM
Sinus rhythm. First degree A-V block. Possible left atrial
abnormality.
Q-T interval may be prolonged. Early transition. Downsloping
anterolateral
ST segments with T wave inversions - cannot exclude ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2114-6-23**] the QRS complexes and
ST-T wave changes in
leads V2-V3 could be positional. Voltage criteria for left
ventricular
hypertrophy are no longer present.

CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)  [**2114-6-19**] 11:49 AM
COMPARISON: No comparison available at the time of dictation.
Status post CABG, the two apical sternotomy wires are ruptured.
Post-surgical clips in standard position. There is slight
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without signs of
overhydration or cardiac insufficiency, there is no evidence of
pleural effusions. Dense costosternal cartilages. In the lung
parenchyma, subtle interstitial thickening suggests minimal
airways disease. There are no focal parenchymal opacities
suggestive of pneumonia. No evidence of pneumothorax.






Brief Hospital Course:
71 y.o M with L foot gangrene, was directly admitted to Vascular
Surgery/Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] service on [**2114-6-19**]

abdominal aortogram and unilateral extremity runoff by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].

He was kept after his arteriography for a femoral endarterctomy.
His post operative course after the femoral endarterectomy was
complicated by hypertension to the 70s systolic.

The patient was extubated from his second surgery on [**6-26**].

The patient was transferred to the VICU on POD 4 after being
weaned off her nitrogycerin drip.

The patient's arterial line was removed on POD 5.

Pt stabalized. A PT consult was obtained. Recommended rehab. Pt
trnsfered to rehab in stable condition.

Neuro: The patient had excellent pain control during his
hospitalization.

patient had postoperative hypotension after his femoral
endarterectomy on [**6-25**]. He was started on a pressor in the ICU
for blood pressure support.

RESP: The patient remained in good respiratory status throughout
his stay. He was briefly intubated and in the ICU for
hypotension postoperatively. His sats have remained stable on
the floor.

GI: The patient was started on a cardiac diet in the ICU. He was
tolerating a diet prior to discharge.

FEN/GU: The patient has a history of ESRD, and does not void.
The patient underwent regular hemodialysis three times a week.
He was followed by the renal team while he was here.

HEME: The patient was transfused 1 unit of blood on [**7-1**] for a
hematocrit of 25.5. This was not due to acute blood loss. He
remained hemodynamically stable afterwards.

ID: The patient was started on Augmentin for the dry gangrene on
his left first toe. The course was completed and the patient was
restarted on Augmentin on [**7-5**] for possible infection around his
wound. He will stay on this for a 7 day course.
