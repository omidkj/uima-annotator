Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4781**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2118-2-4**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was worked-up in
the usual preoperative manner. Heparin and nitroglycerin were
continued. On [**2118-2-5**], Mr. [**Known lastname 4781**] was taken to the operating
room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four
vessels. Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively
he was taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. He
remained intubated as he was quite lethargic on postoperative
day one. On postoperative day two, he was alert and successfully
extubated. Aspirin, a statin and beta blockade were started. On
postoperative day three he was transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. As
he had a myocardial infraction preoperatively, an ace inhibitor
was started.  He was seen in consultation by the [**Last Name (un) **]
Endocrinology service, who recommended placing him on lantus, a
humalog sliding scale, and metformin.  He received insulin
administration teaching, diabetes diet instruction, and glucose
testing education.

He continued to make steady progress and was discharged home on
postoperative day 9.
