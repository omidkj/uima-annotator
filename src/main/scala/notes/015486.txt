Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
dysphagia, r/o airway compromise

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
43M w/ HTN, asthma, ?polymyositis, OSA on CPAP now being
transferred from OSH for ENT evaluation of left peritonsillar
phelegmon/soft tissue swelling and concerns of airway
compromise.

Admitted to OSH on [**4-6**] with complaints of tongue swelling and
left mouth pain in the setting of recent dental procedure about
1 week prior to evaluation. Per records, had been evaluated in
ED and given clindamycin prior to admission. No fevers, chills,
n/v/sob but had noted dysphagia w/ both solids and liquids.

At OSH, was afebrile, hemodymically stable w/o respiratory
compromise although labs did demonstrate leukocytosis to 16K.
Initial neck CT on [**4-6**] reported left parapharyngeal phlegmotous
changes vs early abscess without invasion into retropharyngeal
space or airway compromise. Started on IV clinda and solumedrol
w/ histamine blockade. Symptoms appeared stable but w/
persistent dysphagia. However, repeat neck CT on [**4-8**] at OSH
reportedly demonstrated increased enlargement of left
peritonsillar soft tissue w/ compromise of adjacent oropharanyx
and complete occlusion of nasopharynx. Apparently, anesthesia
had evaluated airway and graded ASA II. Plans made for transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**] for ENT evaluation.

In ED, afebrile, labs notable for leukocytosis to 15.8. ENT
evaluation at bedside included review of OSH scans and
fiberoptic eval demonstrating unremarkable nasopharynx w/
swelling of left base of tongue without obvious mucosal
abnormality and normal epiglottis. Larynx rotated slightly to
right but TVC easily visualized, left vocal cord paralysis.
Meanwhile, minimal FVC edema w/ secretions in vallecula and
pyriform sinus. OSA w/ collapse of lateral pharyngeal wall.
Differntial dx per ENT included atypical angioedema, ?tongue
malignancy or infection. Recommended MICU admission for airway
observation w/ continued IV abx and airway steroid doses.

History from patient reveals that he had been treated with
zithromax for uri type sx prior to routine filling of left upper
molar on [**3-30**]. Procedure was uncomplicated but on day following
began to note left mouth/facial ache w/ radiation to left head.
No fever, chills, st. Apaprently spoke w/ dentist for these sx
and apparently prescribed pcn. Several days later, was eating
salad with friends when suddenly noted left tongue swelling and
difficulty w/ swallowing food - getting stuck at the back of
throat. This has persisted since that time - difficulty w/ solid
consistency. Also noted consistent hoarsenss of voice. No ST. No
n/v. No acid reflux although was prescribed omeprazole for ?of
reflux related sx. He apparently sought ED eval on [**4-4**] and
given po clinda for unclear reasons. Symptoms progressed until
hopsitaliaztion. Dysphagia has been stable but persistent during
hospitalization.

ROS notable for mild cough but no SOB or wheezing or CP. HA has
persisted, mostly left sided, no neck stiffness, ?mild
photophobia but o/w no vision changes/hearing changes. Has had
abdominal discomfort for which recent w/u included reported neg
EGD and csope. No urinary sx or change in bowel habits. Does
admit to 20 lb weight loss over last month secondary to
decreased appetite while off steroids. No rash/pruritus.

Imaging:
CT Neck: Soft tissue thickening at the level of base of the
tongue to the left of the midline, as noted on prior MRI, but
without evident edema. Perhaps the finding reflects cranial
nerve dysfunction. Please correlate clinically
.
Video swallow: Mild-to-moderate pharyngeal dysphasia

.
[**4-15**] CT neck with contrast: The present study does not suggest
an inflammatory process. Tortuous distal left internal carotid
artery, whose pathological significance relative to the
above-noted findings is unclear
.
Csf cytology: No malignant cells
.
MRI/MRA neck: FINDINGS: There is no evidence for obstruction of
either arterial or venous structures. However, there is
confirmation of a very tortuous, corkscrew- shaped distal left
internal carotid artery just proximal to its entrance into the
carotid foramen. Surrounding this vessel is high T1 signal seen
prior to contrast infusion, and without perceptible contrast
enhancement. The findings raise the question of an arterial
dissection at this locale, with the tortuous vessel impressing
itself on the region of the jugular bulb. Posterior displacement
of the left side of the tongue base is again well shown and
there are no other extravascular lesions appreciated at this
time.

CONCLUSION: The findings are of concern for a left-sided
cervical internal carotid artery dissection, possibly with
aneurysmal dilatation.

COMMENT: This study, as well as all preceding imaging
examinations related to this patient performed at this hospital
were forwarded in order to obtain consultation with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 20400**], chief of Radiology, [**State 51252**],
[**Location (un) 86**], [**State 350**]. During a telephone conversation on [**4-17**], [**2172**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20400**] agreed that the most likely explanation for
left sided cranial neuropathy (involving nerves IX, X and [**Doctor First Name 81**]),
was secondary to a mass effect arising from the suspected left
internal carotid artery dissection.


Brief Hospital Course:
43M w/ HTN, obesity, OSA now being eval for persistent dysphagia
and enlarged left peritonsillar soft tissue, found to have
multiple cranial nerve deficits and left carotid dissection.

1. ? Left peritonsillar swelling: On admission the etiology was
not clear. Initial concerns were for infectious process such as
peritonsillar abscess although pt was  afebrile and furthermore
did not appear toxic. However, this was in the face of steroids
and near continuous ABX since early [**Month (only) 958**]. He was maintained on
Clindamycin IV and Decadron per ENT recs. Blood cultures were
obtained which were negative. Based upon initial CT at OSH
suggestive of airway compromise, pt maintained in MICU for
observation. He has undergone several fiberoptic exam via ENT
and there was no evidence of airway compromise, epiglottis,
although there are concerns about left vocal co
