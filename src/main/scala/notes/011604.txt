Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit in the
[**Hospital Ward Name 332**] building following her operative case give some
hypotension issues. During her case, she developed a junctional
arrhythmia with hypotension and decreased urine output, and 4
liters of crystalloid were given, 1 unit of packed red cells
were given and the EBL was 300 during the case. The patient had
100 mL of urine output during the case as well. A transthoracic
echo was performed intra-op which showed decreased ventricular
filling.

NEURO/PAIN: The patient was maintained on IV pain medication in
the immediate post-operative period while in the ICU and
transitioned to PO narcotic medication with adequate pain
control on POD#8. The patient remained neurologically intact and
without change from baseline. The patient remained alert and
oriented to person, location and place.

CARDIOVASCULAR: As mentioned above, the patient had developed
intra-op hypotension requiring pressor support during the
immediate post-op period, but this was quickly weaned in the
unit POD#1. The patient was volume resuscitated with ample
crystalloids, albumen and packed red cells with good effect. She
received a total of one unit of packed red cells in the post-op
period. She had cardiac enzymes were negative in the ICU.
Cardiology was consulted and gave recommendations regarding her
rhythm and hypotension which included cardiac enzyme evaluation,
serial EKG's which were stable and blood pressure medication
recommendations. Once transferred from the ICU, hypertension
became the issue. At times she escalated to pressures of
200/100s and required multiple doses of Hydralazine and IV
Lopressor for control. By HOD#[**7-22**] she was transitioned to PO
blood pressure medication, including her home Carvedilol and
Norvasc (which she had taken in the past according to oupatient
cardiology notes) with good effect. This had stabilized on
discharge. Vitals signs were closely monitored via telemetry.
Cardiology was involved with medical decision making related to
blood pressure medications.

** Of note, the patient had a known thoracic aortic aneurysm
which was noted on previous admissions and CXR on this admission
confirmed mediastinal widening given this history. She was
encouraged to follow-up with cardiothoracic surgery with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 914**] clinic she will need a CTA of the Torso prior to
this appointment ***

RESPIRATORY: The patient was extubated in the immediate post-op
period successfully. The patient had no episodes of
