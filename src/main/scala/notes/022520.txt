Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 82 yo M with significant GI bleed in the past [**2-16**]
anticoagulation for past STEMI. PCP found pt to be anemic and
arranged for admission.

# Blood loss Colon Cancer: This is most consistent with GI
bleed, most likely chronic since past admission as HCT stable
over the past 24 hours, no melena, and pt asymptomatic. Patient
received 2 units of RBC, and IV PPi was initiated. GI was
consulted and pt underwent EGD + colonoscop.  Colonoscopy showed
partially obstructing mass consistent with colon cancer.  Before
doing to the OR, he was transitioned off plavix with a heparin
drip.  The day of surgery, he had some BRBPR and was transfused
an additional one unit of blood.  He was taken to the OR by
surgery.
.
# Chronic Systolic CHF: secondary to MI. Stable although signs
of volume overload. since pt is receiveing significant volume
with blood he also received low dose lasix givent his poor renal
function.  He tolerated this well.  Patient was also hydrated
Pre operatively and did not show any signs of volume overload.
ACE I was held due to patients bump in Cr.

# CAD: s/p stent placement. Patient was initially continued on
all his outpatient medications, including ASA and plavix because
of his recent stent placement.  After the colon mass was
discovered, cardiology was consulted regarding his
anticoagulation and surgery.  His aspirin was continued.  Plavix
was stopped three days prior to surgery and he was started on a
heparin drip during the plavix washout.  The drip was stopped
the morning of surgery.
.
# Chronic renal failure: Cr was initially stable, but bumped
during his hospitalization.  Lisinopril was stopped the patient
was given fluids to protect his kidneys during the dye load of
CT scan.  Cr was back to baseline at the time of surgery.

# Vascular: Patient had symptoms of claudication on admission;
however, vascular studies completed in house do not show any
arterial insufficiency
