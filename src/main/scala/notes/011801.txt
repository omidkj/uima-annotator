Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9824**]
Chief Complaint:
back pain/SOB/weakness in legs

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
73 yo M with CAD, DM, CRI, and neuropathy who presents from home
with SOB. He went swimming yesterday but then had a hard time
getting out of his wheelchair. Chronically pt has been
debillitaed since his AAA repair and knee replacements.
Recently, he noticd a decline in his strength. Over the past one
and a half months his legs would given out under him, no
LOC/syncope or other signs. 3 falls over months. Because of this
weakness he now uses a walker, weakness in the buttock. He awoke
this morning, and now he couldn't move his legs. No
numbness/tingling/bowel/bladder problems.
.
Baseline DOE with 20-30 ft. Had a cough today and fever. +sick
contact.
.
He was seen on [**5-27**] by his PCP who noted LE weakness. He was
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for this and had an EMG which showed
multiple possible etiologies. Lasix recently increased by his
PCP.
.
In the ED, VS 99.4, 103, 151/85, 20, 92% RA. Spiked to 101.8 in
the ED. Exam with 2/5 LE strength. A neuro consult was obtained
who reccomended an MRI, however pt was too large, in order to
r/o an epidural abscess. He did recieved a CT spine/chest which
showed a PNA and r/o PE. Ortho spine consulted in the ED. Given
750 mg IV levafloxacin, nitro paste, vancomycin, CTX. For CT
scan he got bicarb and mucomyst.
.
He was admitted to the MICU for q1 hr neuro checks.

PA AND LATERAL CHEST: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
Pulmonary vascularity is stable. Opacity at the right base
medially is unchanged but not well identified on the lateeral
view. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

Non-contrast head CT scan: There is no evidence of hemorrhage,
shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation appears grossly preserved.
Hypodensity in the periventricular white matter of both cerebral
hemispheres is seen suggesting chronic microvascular ischemia.
Visualized paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated.

CT spine:
1. Study is extremely limited by patient body habitus. No
definite enhancing lesions identified, however at best CT is a
low sensitivity study and epidural abscess cannot be excluded on
this study. MRI is more sensitive in evaluation for epidural
abscess.
2. Right lung consolidation concerning for pneumonia, better
assessed on dedicated chest CT of the same day.
3. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, possibly reactive.
4. AAA, with endoluminal stent. Timing of contrast bolus is not
adequate for evaluation for potential leak.
5. Coronary artery calcifications noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pneumonia: Though initially admitted with concern for weakness,
it seemed that the patient had a right lower lobe pneumonia in
addition.  The cause is likely community acquired as he did not
have signs of aspiration on evaluation.  He was treated with
levofloxacin and metronidazole for a total of 10 days (finishes
course as outpatient).  Sputum cultures were negative.  He has
increased white count and concerning CXR findings for RLL
pneumonia. Has been ruled out for PE. Breathing has
significantly improved while he has received antibiotics.
Therefore, will continue nebs, antibiotics for
community/aspiration pneumonia (levofloxacin/metronidazole).
Sputum cultures represent G+ cocci in pairs which was
respiratory flora.

Lower extremity weakness: Initial description was concerning for
disc herniation or epidural abscess and he was evluated by
neurology.  Recommendations were made to do an MRI however, the
patient could not fit into the MRI machine.  Therefore he was
initially empirically treated for an epidural abscess.  However
his symptoms improved very rapidly and a WBC scan was negative.
Given these, an epidural abscess was ruled out.  The patient's
strength improved with the improvement in his pneumonia and with
diuresis (decrease in LE edema) making deconditioning a possible
cause.  Nonetheless, he should have an MRI done as an outpatient
in a Shields MRI.

Acute on chronic CRI: Appears to have a baseline around 2 that
was initially elevated but improved during his hospital course.
On discharge 2.3. Causes include medication related, progression
of diabetic neprhopathy, or IV contrast, though initially
thought seconary to dehydration.

Diabetes mellitus: He was continued on his home NPH and SS
insulin, have decreased dosages as he had episodes of
hypoglycemia (likely secondary to his decreased intake in the
hospital). Have discussed having smaller intake and need to have
tight blood sugar control.

Coronary artery disease:He was continued outpt meds,initially he
had an elevated tropinin but in the setting of RF, CK/MB normal.
No symptoms of chest pain or significant ECG changes. Continued
beta-blocker and aspirin.

HTN: Was restarted on lisinopril and changed to metoprolol given
poor renal function

LE edema: Was diuresed with lasix and had improvement in edema
with simultaneous improvment in renal function.
