Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
Difficulty in breathing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation with sedation
thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
52 yo female with history of [**Location (un) 805**] Syndrome, atrial
fibrillation, CHF (? diastolic, last EF 70%), history of MVR,
recent recurrent PNAs, and severe COPD, who presents with
shortness of breath.  She had a recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (1) 70560**] for HAP; during that admission, she was treated for
HAP x2.  Her admission was complicated by Afib with RVR.  Her
brother reports that she seemed to improve at rehab initially.
She finished her antibiotics approximately 5 days prior to
admission.  Two days prior to admission the patient reported
worsening breathing and increased sputum production, although
she was having a hard times coughing it up.  The patient's
brother (and HCP) did not notice her wheezing more.  Per [**Hospital1 1501**],
CXR showed RLL PNA, and she has been running low grade temps of
99.  She was started on Levaquin 3 days prior to admission
without improvement, so she was sent to the ED.  She was
slightly more hypoxic, increased O2 requirement from 2-4L.  In
the ED, the patient reported chest pain only with cough.  She
denied other symptoms.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.5 120 168/108 20 94% 4L NC. Her
EKG showed rapid Afib, no other changes.  On exam, she was A&Ox3
and was conversant.  She had poor airflow and decreased breath
sounds at bases.  Over course of ED, she developed worsening
respiratory distress with tachypnea and lots of accessory muscle
use.  She did not desat.  The ED started bipap, but she didn't
tolerate well; her O2 sats decreased to 86%.  They were
considering intubating her...  Her CXR showed RLL pneumonia very
similar to previous CXR.  She was given Vancomycin 1gm IV x1 and
Cefepime for HAP.  She was given diltiazem 10mg IV x1 for afib
with RVR, and HR improved to 90s.  She did not have any
hypotension.  She was given 2L of IVF in ED.  She has one
peripheral IV.  She was placed briefly on BIPAP but desaturated
to 86% and looked more uncomfortable. ABG showed 7.16/72/87/27.
She was intubated in the ED and transferred here.

CTA chest [**2103-1-17**]:
Although this study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation, images of the upper abdomen demonstrate reflux of
contrast into the intrahepatic IVC and hepatic veins, and an
apparent filling defect in the intrahepatic IVC. Nonadditional
abnormalities are identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Two new, large, left atrial thrombi. Confirmation with
transesophageal
echo was recommended. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Filling defect within the intrahepatic IVC, which is
incompletely imaged but could represent mixing artifact.
However, further evaluation with ultrasound of the intrahepatic
IVC is recommended to exclude clot.
3. Possible left lower lobe pneumonia. Clinical correlation is
recommended.
4. Stable large right pleural effusion and small left pleural
effusion.
.

CT head without contrast [**2103-1-17**]:
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial process.
.
[**2103-1-17**] Gallbladder/liver U/S:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of filling defect within the
intrahepatic IVC.
.
[**2103-1-18**] MR head w/o contrast
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of acute infarction. Moderate microangiopathic
small-vessel
disease.
.
[**2103-1-19**] TTE
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. A
possible left atrial thrombus vs mass is seen (best visualized
in parasternal views) which measures 1.4 x 0.8 and appears to
adhere to the wall of the left atrium. This cannot be readily
visualized with Definity contrast due to shadowing artifact. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. A mitral annuloplasty
ring is seen.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-12-5**], the
left atrial mass appears new. This focused study did not
[**Year (4 digits) 4656**] valvular structure and function or ventricular
function.
.
If clinically indicated, a TEE may better assess the size and
location of the mass/thrombus.
.
[**2103-1-17**] MRI head
There is no evidence of hemorrhage or areas of slow diffusion to
suggest acute infarction. Bilateral scattered foci of T2 and
FLAIR hyperintensities with confluent signal changes in the
periventricular white matter extending into the brainstem
consistent with moderate microangiopathic small vessel disease.

A punctate focus of FLAIR and T2 prolongation is demonstrated in
the right
thalamus, suggesting an old lacunar infarct. The ventricles and
sulcal
configuration are age appropriate. There is no mass or mass
effect. The
visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.

IMPRESSION:
No evidence of acute infarction. Moderate microangiopathic
small-vessel
disease.
.
[**2103-1-17**] Liver U/S
No evidence of filling defect within the intrahepatic IVC
.
CXR ([**2103-1-26**]):
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-23**], there has been
substantial
decrease in the right pleural effusion. Severe chronic pulmonary
disease
persists with coarse interstitial markings. No definite acute
focal pneumonia
is appreciated.
