HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old
gentleman found ambulating in the street intoxicated with
stab wounds times three to the left chest and back.  The
patient was reportedly stable, alert, and oriented with good
vital signs in the field and en route to the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department.

However, upon arrival to the Emergency Department the patient
had repeated bouts of hypotension.  He complained only of
left-sided chest pain.  Initial examination was negative for
bleeding in the abdomen and also for any cardiac tamponade.
A left-sided chest tube was inserted for a presumptive
hemopneumothorax with minimal output through the tube.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was intoxicated with alcohol
upon arrival.  The patient was confused at this time.
Reportedly homeless.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
in the Emergency Department revealed blood pressure
fluctuated between 88/46 to 125/59, heart rate was 82,
respiratory rate was 20, and oxygen saturation was 100% on
nonrebreather.  The patient was alert and oriented.
Intoxicated but spoke in full sentences.  There was no
jugular venous distention or tracheal deviation.  Breath
sounds were equal bilaterally with a left-sided chest tube in
place.  There was an entrance wound in the midclavicular
left-sided anterior chest at the level of the xiphoid.  A
second stab wound was noted with the entrance wound noted on
the posterior left chest at approximately T7 just below the
scapula.  A third entrance wound just proximal to the left
scapula on the posterior chest wall with positive hemostasis
at all wound sites.  The heart was regular in rate and
without murmurs.  The abdomen revealed positive bowel sounds.
The abdomen was soft and nondistended.  Rectal tone was
normal.  Guaiac-negative.  A Foley catheter was in place
draining yellow/clear urine.  The fast examination was
negative.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial
laboratories were significant for a hematocrit of 36 and a
I-cal of 1.07, with coagulations and Chemistry-7 normal.
Serum and toxicology screens were negative with the exception
of an alcohol level of 351.  Urinalysis was also normal.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed no
pneumothorax.

A subsequent computerized axial tomography showed there to be
a left pneumothorax; where after the chest tube was inserted.
Pelvic was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A left internal jugular and right
subclavian line were established.  Despite repeated fluid
boluses, the patient remained hypotensive and was taken to
the operating room for exploratory laparotomy.  Mesenteric
bleeding was found and the vessels were tied off.  The
abdomen was packed and left open.

The patient was returned to the operating room on hospital
day two to close the abdomen.  The patient then began to
spike temperatures and was started on broad-spectrum
antibiotics.  A thoracoscopy was performed and found to be
growing yeast, and fluconazole was added to the Levaquin,
ampicillin, and Flagyl which the patient was already on.

On hospital day nine, a repeat computed tomography was
performed where the patient was diagnosed with an ischemic
bowel and was taken to the operating room where a left
segmental colectomy, transverse colostomy, and Hartmann pouch
were performed.

The patient was then returned to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit where his condition improved, and his chest tube was
removed, and he was electively extubated on hospital day
twelve and then reintubated for decreasing oxygen
saturations.  The patient became febrile again.  A right
middle lobe infiltrate was discovered, and he was diagnosed
with a pseudomonal infection in the right middle lobe and was
started on Zosyn.

On hospital day thirteen, the patient self-extubated himself
and remained such.  Due to an increasing thrombocytosis.  On
hospital day eighteen, an abdominal ultrasound revealed no
splenic vein thrombosis.  He continued to become more stable.
His thrombocytosis resolved, and he was transferred to the
floor where he finished his two weeks of gentamicin and Zosyn
for pseudomonal pneumonia.

On hospital day twenty seven, his ostomy was debrided.  He
was ambulating well and was ready for discharge to the
[**Doctor Last Name 11009**] House rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post multiple stab wounds to the left chest.
2.  Left pneumothorax.
3.  Status post exploratory laparotomy for mesenteric
bleeding.
4.  Segmental colectomy for ischemic colitis with transverse
colostomy and Hartmann pouch.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (The patient was to be discharged
on)
1.  Combivent inhaler 1 to 2 puffs inhaled q.6h. as needed.
2.  Miconazole nitrate powder to be applied to the stoma area
with each pouch change should a rash develop.
3.  Oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg one to two tablets p.o.
q.4-6h. as needed (for pain).
4.  Oxycodone 20 mg one tablet q.12h. for two weeks.
