History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]yo woman with h/o CAD, CHF LVEF 30%, HTN, VT s/p
dual chamber ICD [**2135-11-30**] who presented to the ED this AM after
syncopal epsode. She was in her USOH until this morning when she
woke with poor appetite. She ate a few bites of cereal and tea
and immediately became nauseated with epigastric/B lower rib
pain, had a large bowel movement, vomited and then syncopized.
her granddaughter was there and attempted to catch her fall. She
did not hit her head. She denied any palpitations, chest pain,
shortness of breath, arm or jaw pain. She awoke when the
paramedics came and she was taken the the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In ED her SBP was in the 170's, her HR in the 70's. In the
Emergency department she evidently reported chest pain "that
felt like my heart attack" asoociated with nausea, relieved by
SL NTG and morphine. She also received aspirin and plavix. On
interview in the CCU she adamantly denies any chest pain. EKG
with NSR, RBBB + [**Last Name (LF) 16990**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] deprssion in Vs-6. Bedside
ecchocardiogram showed LVEF 45%, 1+ AR, [**12-27**]+ MR, no MS, [**12-27**]+ TR,
no effusion. Pacer interrogation showed no events tachy or
brady. DDDR 50-120 ppm
.
In addition in the ED she had an abdominal CT which was
negative, CT head and neck negative, CXR showed only
cardiomegaly.
.
On the floor she feels well with the only complaint being mild
abdominal pain. she denies chest pain, SOB, nausea, vomiting. On
ROS she endorses decreased appetite x 1 week with ? 5lbs wt
loss. Denies previous abd pain; hematochezia, melena. She denies
palpitations, CP, SOB, light headedness, sensation of pacer
firing, weakness, numbness, etc. No known sick contacts or
dietary changes.
.
She had a recent hospital admit in [**11-29**] for abnormal stress
test with new lateral ischemia; cardiac cath [**2135-11-28**] showed new
occlusion of diag (comp to [**2133**]), anterolateral, apical,

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo woman with CHF, CAD s/p MI (?IMI) and s/p recent pacemaker
for VT now presenting with syncopal episode and EKG concerning
for TWI in V4-V6.
.
# Syncope: story appears c/w situational vasovagal episode from
nausea/vomiting/defecation. She was ruled out for MI x 3 and was
chest-pain free during her admission. Arrhythmia was ruled out
by negative pacer interrogation and no telemetry events. Her
carotid stenosis is a [**Last Name 19390**] problem however there is no
h/o focal neuro symptoms.  She was not hypotense.  She tolerated
a regular diet and walked up the stairs w/o further syncope.
.
# Chest pain: Pt denied any chest pain, other than
lower-rib/epigastric pain to myself; however reported it to
others.  This could be be [**1-27**] angina vs abdominal etiology. In
the Ddx of abdominal source is GERD, passed gall-stone,
gastritis, PUD although LFTs and abd CT were negative.  She was
kept on her home-dose PPI; her stools were guiac negative.  She
ruled out for MI by 3x cardiac enzymes.  She may have had
ischaemia from the stress of vagally-induced hypotension.  She
remained chest pain free on admission even walking up the
stairs.
.
# Cardiac:
1. Ischaemia: known CAD with 12/06 admit for new lat TWI on
stress; recent cath showing new D1 occlusion and eccho with
similar findings as today (inferolat hypokinesis/post-lat
hypokinesis). Findings on EKG likely stable from prior month.
She denies chest pain; her epigastric/rib pain and syncope could
have represented an ischaemic event vs abdominal pathology and
syncopy from vagal episode.  She ruled out for MI x 3.  Repeat
EKG was similar (slightly decreased STdepression/TWI). Kept on
ASA, plavix, BB, ACEI, statin.  Her outpt cardiologist should
decide on the need for repeat stress test as an outpatient.
.
2. Pump: EF 45% with moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]; no current evidence of
CHF exacerbation; appeared euvolemic on exam.  kept on outpt
Carvedilol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] and quinupril/hct 10/12.5 daily.
.
3. Rhythm: h/o VT s/p dual-chamber pacer; Set to pace 50-120.
Appears to be intermittently atrially paced.  No arrhythmia on
pacer interrogation.
.
# Abdominal pain/nausea/vomiting: Resolved after admission,
could have been [**1-27**] passed gallstone although LFTs wnl, PUD,
gastritis, esophagitis.  She was kept on nexium and tolerated a
regular diet.  She should be considered for outpt endoscopy/
other GI work-up given her iron-deficiency anemia and abdominal
pain.
.
# Anemia: labs c/w iron-deficiency.  Should be f/u by
PCP/gastroenterologist.
.
# HTN: normotense on her home regimen
.
# FEN/GI: Tolerated regular diet; continued nexium
.
# PPX: was kept on SQ heparin, PPI
.
# Code: DNR/I confirmed with pt, family, and attd.
