her right shoulder. She developed rotator cuff tears of her
right shoulder and inability to elevate her right arm. Given her
medical comorbidities, her PCP and [**Name Initial (PRE) **] elected nonsurgical
treatment and rehabilitation. She did recover well but then
developed increasing pain in her right shoulder. Given her

for further surgery, shoulder stiffness, persistent shoulder
pain and recurrent rotator cuff tear. She understood and elected

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 50388**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2117-10-14**] for an elective
right shoulder arthroscopy and rotator cuff repair.
Pre-operatively, she was consented, prepped, and brought down to
the operating room for surgery. She was given an interscalene
block by anesthesia prior to her surgery. Intra-operatively, she
was closely monitored and remained hemodynamically stable. She
tolerated the procedure well without any difficulty or
complication. Post-operatively, she was extubated and
transferred to the PACU for further stabilization and
monitoring. She complain of severe post-operative pain in the
PACU. Anesthesia gave her another interscalene block, which
worked rapidly. Her pain was relieved along with right sided
ptosis, meiosis, nasal stuffiness and dyspnea. Her O2 saturation
was in the 90's. A STAT chest x-ray showed a high hemidiaphragm
which is expected with the block. She was given light sedation
and placed on CPAP. stabilized in the PACU and transferred to
the ICU for further monitoring. She developed respiratory
failure in the ICU secondary to her preoperative medical
comorbidity. She had EKG changes suggestive of ACS. Serial EKG's
and cardiac enzymes were ordered as well as a PE workup. She was
also placed on Heparin for anticoagulation. She ruled out for MI
and PE. On POD #1, she was weaned and extubated without
incident. She was diuresed with Lasix for fluid overload and
progressed well. Her pain was controlled and her breathing
continues to improve. On POD #3, she was transferred to the
step-down floor for further recovery. On the floor, she remained
hemodynamically stable with her pain controlled. She progressed
with both physical and occupational therapy to improve her
strength and mobility. She continues to make steady progress
without any incidents. She was discharged to a rehabilitation
facility in stable condition. She has a follow up appointment
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2719**] on [**2117-10-25**].
