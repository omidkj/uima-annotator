Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, poor oral intake associated
with lethargy and confusion x 2days. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Hospital 8**] Hospital with respiratory distress.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
76 year old male with COPD, CAD, HTN, long history of smoking
transferred from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital for respiratory distress in
the setting of recent ERCP complicated by post-ERCP
pancreatitis.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an [**Hospital3 **] resident, who recently underwent
an ERCP on [**2188-3-18**], and subsequently developed abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, poor PO intake, lethargy, and confusion.  He
was admitted on [**3-20**] to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital. The ERCP findings
were noteable for a dilated bile duct, cyst duct stump, and
pancreatic ducts s/p stent placement in CBD. At the time of the
[**Hospital 8**] Hospital admission, he was febrile to 101, with a
leukocytosis of 19K and amylase greater than 2400, lipase
greater than 2600, but normal LFTs.

The patient was admitted and treated presumptively for post-ERCP
pancreatitis with NPO diet, aggresive IVF and antibiotics
(Ertapenem x2
doses) for a question of cholangitis.  The patient did undergo a
CT scan that revealed, per report, peripancreatic fat stranding.


On [**2188-3-21**], the patient was seen in GI consultation.  Over night
he developed respiratory distress and was placed on BiPAP.  Due
to failure to improve, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation and care.  On [**2188-3-21**],  his arterial blood
gases were 7.48/26/79/19/97%.

Upon admission, the patient complained of difficulty breathing
and feeling short of breath.  He was intubated shortly
thereafter for increasing tachypnea and work of breathing.

Past Medical History:
CAD, s/p stent x2 [**2183**] (echo [**1-21**] EF 65%), COPD, s/p
cholecystectomy, s/p appendectomy, chronic lower back pain s/p
lumbar laminectomy x3 complicated by left foot drop (wears
brace), HTN, DVT, PE s/p IVC filter placement, AAA 3.6cm,
orthostatic hypotension.

.
[**2188-3-27**] Torso CT with Contrast:
1. Worsening of pancreatitis, though the imaging findings often
lag behind
the patient's clinical status. There is moderately extensive
peripancreatic fluid and stranding; however, no evidence of
pancreatic necrosis, vascular complication or discrete fluid
collection.
2. New small-to-moderate left and tiny right pleural effusions
with
associated atelectasis.
3. Small ground-glass focus in the left upper lobe may represent
inflammation or infection.
4. CBD stent in situ, with expected pneumobilia and minimal
intrahepatic bile duct dilation.
5. Moderate axial hiatal hernia.
6. 3 cm infrarenal AAA
.

[**2188-3-21**] Admission PA CXR:
Midline gas collection just above the diaphragm is presumably a
loop of bowel or gastric fundus in a midline hernia. Lungs
clear. Heart size normal. No pleural effusion, pneumothorax or
upper mediastinal abnormality. Stomach is below the diaphragm is
severely distended.
.
[**2188-4-3**] AP/Lat CXR:
Examination is limited due to low lung volumes. Within this
limitation, the hiatal hernia unchanged. Compressive atelectasis
at the left lung base is noted adjacent to the hernia. The lungs
are otherwise clear without focal opacity. The heart size is
likely exaggerated due to low lung
volumes and lordotic position. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are normal. The right- sided central line and
nasogastric tube have been removed. Biliary stent and IVC filter
are again seen.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
.
[**2188-4-8**] CXR Line Placement:
Existing PICC line repositioned, now with tip in the SVC. The
PICC line
is ready to use.
