Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Self-transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for further workup

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Bone marrow aspirate

History of Present Illness:
67 yo M, PMH of DM, CAD (CABG), DJD (disc surgery), COPD,
presents with epistaxis, purpura, lymphadenopathy, back pain,
anemia, thrombocytopenia, fevers, fatigue x 2.5 months, 30 lb
weight loss over past month.  Pt developed persistent epistaxis
at 2 pm today, still bleeding 7 hours later.  Pt states 30 lb
weight loss over past month.  His back pain has been so severe
that he has not been able to walk properly for the past 2.5
months.  The back pain projects down in and along the spinal
canal, from the shoulder blades down to his buttocks, worst in
disc surgery site in lower thoracic/upper lumbar spine.  The
pain radiates to his buttocks bilaterally, and radiates down his
leg posterolaterally bilaterally.  The pt has experienced motor
weakness in both legs for the past 2.5 months, no tingling, no
sensory loss.  No bladder or rectal incontinence.  No erectile
dysfunction.  Pt has felt fatigued and short of breath for the
past few months.  Pt has never had a bone marrow biopsy.
.
Pt also has 50 pk yr smoking hx and COPD, and chronic dyspnea on
exertion.  His PPD test has been negative, he has not traveled
out of the country, been in shelters, or been incarcerated over
the past several years.  Pt has had unprotected sex with his
girlfriend for the past 3 years.
.
Pt has been hospitalized in [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for the past 4
weeks, for intractable back pain, bilateral hilar and
mediastinal adenopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia,
MRSA. Mediastinoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed to sample
lymph node tissue, which yielded benign findings.  Bronch sample
found MRSA in the sputum.  Pt was placed on regimen of Vanco and
Zosyn for coverage.
.
Pt had a fine needle aspiration of a right lower lung lesion,
but before FNA, pt was noted as having low plts and hct of 19.
The patient had hemoptysis with small amounts of bloody sputum.
Pt received plts and red cell transfusions.  Path for the needle
biopsy is still pending.
.
Pt was in constant pain at [**Hospital1 1474**], and needed his pain regimen
adjusted constantly until placed on a PCA pump.  He is allergic
to codeine.  He wished a second opinion for his medical
problems.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
67 yo M, PMH of DM, CAD (CABG), DJD (disc surgery), COPD,
presents with epistaxis, purpura, lymphadenopathy, severe back
pain, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fevers, fatigue x months, 30 lb
weight loss over past month.
.
1.  MEDIASTINAL AND ABDOMINAL LAD:
Diff Dx:  LAD could be due to myeloma, lymphoma, primary lung
ca, TB (no apparent exposure), granulomatous diseases, HIV
(unprotected sex for 3 years, STD), fungus.  Other possibilities
are Wegener's (hemoptysis, but no renal failure), sarcoidosis
(but unusual patient profile, and Ca is 9.4).
.
In [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, the pt had undergone a CT Chest, which
showed mediastinal LAD and a RLL lesion.  Mediastinoscopy was
performed, and the [**Hospital1 1474**] pathologist (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] reported
"benign findings" (detailed [**Hospital1 1474**] pathology report and phone
numbers included in the chart).  FNA of a RLL lesion was
performed, and Dr.[**Name (NI) 16211**] initial impression was small cell ca
of the lung.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], a CT Torso was performed, demonstrating diffuse giant
LAD throughout the mediastinum and abdomen, as well as a RLL
lesion, 2 small liver lesions (one in caudate lobe, one in left
lobe), and no splenomegaly.  Since the patient had SOB, chest
pain, and a R apical pneumothorax after his mediastinoscopy at
[**Hospital1 1474**], it was decided that the giant lymph nodes found on CT
Torso, the lung lesion, and 2 liver lesions would not be
biopsied, in case the results of the bone marrow aspirate were
sufficient for diagnosis.  HIV and ANCA were negative.
.
2.  BACK PAIN:
Diff Dx:  Back pain could be due to myeloma (lytic lesions),
colon ca (pathologic fx), mets to bone from lung ca (pathologic
fx), slipped disc.
.
Metastases to the spine were suspected.  T- and L-spine XR
showed neither a pathologic fracture nor lytic lesions.
SPEP/UPEP and PSA were negative.  During admission, the pt
experienced a fall, in which he was "walking normally, and then
all of a sudden my legs went numb, and I went to take a step and
my legs buckled like the batteries had been taken out of them".
Neurologic findings showed R LE weakness.  Pt was started on
steroids with communication with Hem-Onc.  MRI of the Head, C-,
T-, and L-spine ruled out cord compression, but a possibility of
an epidural tumor was noted at T10/T11.  The next day,
neurologic findings progressed to R LE and R UE weakness and
decreased pinprick sensation, and decreased R lower face
pinprick sensation.  MRI Head showed a possible subacute pontine
infarct.  Pt has a h/o spinal fusion surgery [**30**] years ago, and
an LP under fluoro was attempted to rule out carcinomatous
meningitis.  2 units plts were transfused before LP.  However,
while attempting to lie on his abdomen, the pt was in
excruciating pain and his O2 sat dropped to 90%, and the LP
could not be performed.
.
3.  EPISTAXIS:
Diff Dx:  Epistaxis that does not stop after several hours, with
a plt count of 56, in a non-uremic pt is unusual, and suggestive
of myeloma, lymphoma, bone marrow aplasia, DIC, qualitative plt
defects.
.
The pt presented with plts 56 and profuse epistaxis that did not
respond to Afrin, pressure, tilting of his head.  Epistaxis
ceased onl
