STUDIES:
[**10-24**] CXR: FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: New multifocal, patchy
bilateral airspace opacities are seen, left greater than right.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable. Again seen is
evidence of prior CABG. Pulmonary vascularity remains within
normal limits. No definite pleural effusions identified.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
.
[**10-24**] CT Head:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage,
shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus. Again
seen are focal lacunes involving the right caudate head and
bilateral cerebral hemispheres. These do not appear
significantly changed compared to prior study. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation appears grossly preserved. Again noted is a
hypoplastic right maxillary sinus. No mucosal thickening is seen
in the visualized paranasal
sinuses.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Old
lacunes in the right caudate head and bilateral cerebellar
hemispheres again seen, unchanged from prior.
.
[**10-26**] TTE:
No obvious vegetations seen on mitral, aortic, or tricuspid
valves although due to valvular thickening, the sensitivity of
TTE to detect endocarditis is decreased. Severe left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Mild right ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Mild to moderate aort
