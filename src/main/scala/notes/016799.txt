Studies:

CT Head [**2123-3-7**]
Large intraventricular hemorrhage with interval worsening and
greater mass effect on third ventricle. CTA of the head appears
unremarkable.
.
CT head [**2123-3-9**]
Extensive left-sided intraventricular hemorrhage with a small
amount of hemorrhage in the right lateral ventricle, similar in
distribution to the prior examination. There may be slight
interval increase in surrounding edema with 5-mm rightward shift
of midline structures, previously measured as 4 mm. Pl. see
prior CTA study for vascular details.
.
LENIs [**2123-3-19**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either
lower extremity.
.
IVC filter [**2123-3-19**]:
1. Placement of an Option IVC filter, just below the level of
the lowermost right renal vein.
2. The filter is retrievable, and removal should be considered
when the
patient's contraindication to anticoagulation is no longer
present.
.
[**2123-4-6**] Portable abdomen:
IMPRESSION: IVC filter in the expected infrarenal location. No
evidence of
bowel obstruction.
.
Patient has had more than 30 chest X-rays, below is most recent
([**2122-4-20**]):
FINDINGS: The right PICC terminates in the mid SVC. Tracheostomy
is noted.
There is minimal if any change from [**4-18**]. There is
persistent
cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary vascular
congestion, greater on the left. No focal consolidation is seen,
though an underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
