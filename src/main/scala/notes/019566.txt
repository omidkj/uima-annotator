Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 50 y.o. male with a recent diagnosis of metastatic
adenocarcinoma of the lung with brain and bone mets s/p WBRT and
EBRT to hip who presents with hemoptysis and fever. The patient
completed radiation five days ago and was prepared to start
chemo on in three days. About two to three days ago he began to
have some hemoptysis with pinkish sputum. This has gotten
progressively worse over the past days so that last night and
today was having multiple episodes of quarter sized hemoptysis.
He was also coughing up an increased amount of thick sputum. He
endorses mild right upper chest pain when he's coughing. He
denies any lightheadedness or dizziness but may have endorsed
"wooziness" to his wife a bit earlier per her report. No
shortness of breath. This morning due to the increased amount of
hemoptysis his wife called his oncologist coverage who
recommended the patient present to the ED for imaging. On
arrival there he had a fever to 101.5 and was hypotensive to
89/71 (but 113/67 on repeat. CTA showed a large mass in the
right upper lobe abutting the pulmonary artery and compressing a
bronchus leading to post obstructive collapse of the lower part
of the RUL. He received levofloxacin 750 mg *1 and was
transferred here for further management.
In the ED initial VS T 98.7, P 75, BP 172/72, RR 18, O2 Sat 100%
on RA. He received metronidazole 500 mg IV *1. VS prior to
leaving the ED were afebrile, BP 120/80, rate in the 110's, and
100% on RA.
Currently, the patient reports mild chest pain with coughing and
frequent cough with thick or bloody sputum. He denies any other
chest pain, SOB, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.
He has not had any subjective fevers or chills at home and was
unaware he was febrile prior to his temperature being taken.

ROS: Denies fevers, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. Had
hip and groin pain prior to radiation therapy and occasionally
taking oxycodone for persistent pain. Denies headache, visual
changes, weakness, or imbalance. Denies exertional chest pain or
SOB. Denies dysuria, hematuria, rash, or skin changes. Denies
any other bleeding or bruising.

Microbiology:
[**11-3**] blood cx from OSH: GNR

[**11-7**] Initial ID Consult RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Surveillance blood culture
2. Switch cipro to IV until assured cultures clear and continue
IV piperacillin/tazobactam (update on [**11-9**] - since sputum is
pan [**Last Name (un) 36**] psuedomonas ID feels that po cipro is adequate)
3. Check stool Cdiff toxin
4. If a second culture becomes positive would check TTE (echo)
given splinter hemorrhages
5. Treat for at least 14 days IV to cover bacteremia and
post-obstructive pneumonia, which may need prolonged course
depending on whether the RUL mass is shrinks with XRT.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo with progressive metastatic lung cancer, s/p recent whole
brain XRT and left hip [**Hospital 39480**] transfered from [**Doctor Last Name 62565**]
Hospital for interventional pulmonary evaluation of hemoptysis
and fever/hypotension to MICU.  CTA showed a RUL mass abutting
pulmonary artery with compression of bronchus and
post-obstructive pneumonia.  Bronchoscopy [**11-5**] showed edematous
RUL mucosa without a source of bleeding.  Stable, he was
transferred out of MICU.  Blood cultures from OSH grew
pan-sensitive Pseudomonas.  Sputum here grew the same.  Abx were
changed from levofloxacin/metronidazole to
ampicillin/sulbactam/cipro and fnially to pip/tazo and cipro
since [**11-6**] x14d course per ID recs, finishing [**2142-11-19**].  Patient
is awaiting transfer back to [**University/College 23925**] [**Doctor Last Name 47799**] to continue abx
and start XRT to his lung (and maybe clear his post-obstructive
pna).  He will likely need a repeat bronchoscopy 4 weeks
following completion of radiation therapy.

Post-obstructive Pneumonia: Continue pip/tazo and cipro x14d
course, last day [**2142-11-19**], unless he requires longer duration
clinically.

Lung CA: Awaiting XRT at [**Doctor Last Name 62565**] Hospital.

CNS mets: Continue dexamethasone.

Dispo: Awaiting bed availability at [**Doctor Last Name 62565**] Hospital
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 88029**]) for hospital transfer.
