Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3376**]
Chief Complaint:
Colon cancer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Laparoscopy converted to laparotomy.
2. Transverse colectomy.
3. Small bowel resection


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 87-year-old female Jehovah's Witness with a
significant cardiovascular history who was diagnosed with a
poorly differentiated carcinoma in the left colon after
presenting with a hematocrit of 10. Preoperative staging with a
CT scan revealed a large mass in the transverse colon and
possible pulmonary nodules. Because of the profound nature of
the anemia induced by the tumor,surgical resection was indicated
even in the face of metastasis. She was referred to  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**],
evaluated, and scheduled for surgical resection of the mass.

PSH; CABGx 4, hysterectomy


Social History:
Jehovah's Witness. Lives with daughter.Does not smoke. Denies
using Etoh or illegal drugs.

Pertinent Results:
RADIOLOGY  Final Report
RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2131-1-22**] 4:06 AM
Reason: Evaluate for infiltrate/edema
INDICATION: Shortness of breath.
Right subclavian catheter is unchanged in position. Congestive
heart failure has slightly improved with decreasing perihilar
edema but residual diffuse interstitial edema remaining.
Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is also slightly
improved. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2131-1-20**] 5:36 AM
Reason: Change in resp status?
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
87 year old woman with Colectomy and post op MI.
IMPRESSION: Stable parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting
moderate pulmonary edema. Bibasilar effusions and associated
atelectasis, left greater than right. Cardiomegaly.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
87 year old woman with lap assist Left colon resection for mass.
H/O TIA's. No with aphasia.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate for acute intracranial process.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2131-1-17**] 10:57 PM
Reason: tlc placement
IMPRESSION:
1. Standard position of right subclavian line.
2. New bilateral parenchymal opacities as described, which in
the presence of known cardiac disease most likely represent
pulmonary edema.
3. Interval minimal increased in heart size.
4. Bilateral pleural effusion most likely related to same
process.
5. Nodules demonstrated on the torso CT cannot be assessed on
the current study in the presence of pulmonary edema.

FINAL
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD or PFO
by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. No LV mass/thrombus.
No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Moderate (2+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate to
severe [3+] TR. Severe PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 1 iv
injection of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline at rest.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at
rest. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior
wall, as well as distal septum and apex (c/w multivessel
coronary artery disease). Quantitative LVEF = 39%. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No PFO seen. Moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
