Admission Date:  [**2193-2-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2193-2-16**]

Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70 year-old
male admitted to the MICU with sepsis, hypertension, status
post episode of ventricular tachycardia now on pressors.  The
patient was admitted to the Vascular Service between [**12-30**]
and [**2193-1-17**].  He has an extensive history of peripheral
vascular disease and status post left femoral popliteal
bypass with a jump graft and a left second toe amputation and
revision.  The patient was found to have a gangrenous wound
with involvement of the left third toe with purulent
discharge and breakdown of the incision site and underwent
further debridement and revision.  He was evaluated by his
vascular surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and thought to be stable for
rehab and that the wound was viable and without need for
further surgical intervention.  The patient was at rehab when
he started complaining of difficulty swallowing and coughing
up dried blood on [**2193-2-13**] and neck pain.

Rehab doctor was called to evaluate the patient for same
complaints and blood pressure was noted to be 70/40 with a
heart rate of 92, white count 33.6.  Blood cultures from
[**2193-2-12**] had four out of four bottles growing gram positive
cocci while on Vancomycin and Levaquin and the patient was
febrile to 102.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**], but on route developed ventricular
tachycardia while on Dopamine and was diverted to [**Hospital3 11531**].  Apparently ventricular tachycardia spontaneously
resolved and the patient was stable in their Emergency
Department and he was sent to [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department while awaiting MICU bed.  In the
Emergency Department here his blood pressure was 60/palp.
The patient was started on neo-synephrine, fluid boluses and
Flagyl was added to his antibiotic regimen.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction in [**2169**], status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2183**], status post catheterization in [**11-8**]
with patent left internal mammary coronary artery to left
anterior descending coronary artery, patent supraventricular
tachycardia to obtuse marginal two and occluded saphenous
vein graft to right coronary artery.  Exercise MIBI on
[**2192-11-22**] showed fixed apical defects, severe fixed distal
anterior wall defect with minimal reversible defect in distal
inferior wall, global left ventricular hypokinesis and apical
akinesis, EF of 22%.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, type 2
diabetes, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis since
[**11-8**], hypercholesterolemia, renal cell carcinoma status post
right nephrectomy in [**2182**] with metastasis to bone treated
with radiation therapy in [**10/2192**] with metastasis to
gallbladder status post cholecystectomy and status post
abdominal wall dissection.  Hypothyroidism, peripheral
vascular disease status post above surgeries.

MEDICATIONS:  Colace, Nephrocaps, Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d.,
Amiodarone 200 q day, Synthroid 100 micrograms q day, Pepcid
20 mg q day, Senna, vitamin C, Levaquin 250 mg po after
hemodialysis.  Zocor 40 q.d., NPH 16 units in the a.m. and 3
units in the p.m.  Calcitriol, Reglan, zinc, aspirin,
Coumadin 1 mg po q day, Vancomycin dose with hemodialysis.

ALLERGIES:  Ativan makes the patient "go crazy."

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.  Rare alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 60/palp increased to 97/36
on neo-synephrine.  Pulse 97.  Respiratory rate 22.  Sating
98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  In general the patient is in
bed in no acute distress.  HEENT oropharynx clear.  Sclera
anicteric.  Neck mildly swollen and full, nontender, no
lymphadenopathy.  No JVD.  Lungs with decreased breath sounds
at the bases.  Cardiovascular irregular irregular rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended
with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities left lower
extremity with TMA frankly necrotic, but no purulence.

INITIAL DATA:  White blood cell count 27.6 with 97%
neutrophils, 3 lymphocytes, 3 monocytes, hematocrit 29.5,
platelets 537, INR 3.1, liver function tests within normal
limits.  Chem 7 143, 4.8, 106, 23, 29, 4.2, glucose 73.
Initial CK negative.  Rhythm strip with sustained ventricular
tachycardia.  Electrocardiogram subsequently showed atrial
fibrillation rate of 97, Q waves in 3 and V1, poor R wave
progression, no ST or T wave changes, unchanged from [**2193-1-30**].
Chest x-ray showed possible right lower lobe infiltrate with
obscured right hemidiaphragm.  CT of the neck showed
degenerative changes of the cervical spine, but no pharyngeal
fluid collections.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Vascular surgery evaluated the patient
and they determined when the patient was medically stable
that he would require bilateral below the knee amputations.
In the interim the patient's left TMA wound received bedside
debridement.

2.  The patient was also complaining of new onset right sided
blindness.  Ophthalmology evaluated the patient in the
Emergency Department.  There is no evidence of septic emboli.
The patient's blindness was consistent with AION.

3.  The patient was also seen by the Infectious Disease
Service for his staph aureus bacteremia, which is likely
secondary to his gangrenous foot.  Other sources of infection
could hve included his dialysis catheter.  The patient was
continued on Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin as well as Flagyl.

4.  Cardiovascular, the patient continued to be persistently
hypotensive.  He was started on neo-synephrine to which
Levophed was also added.  The patient also started to become
dyspneic for which he was intubated.  Immediately after his
intubation the patient became increasingly hypotensive and
also had an episode of ventricular tachycardia and also had
several episodes of supraventricular tachycardia.  Both of
his arrhythmias resolved spontaneously.  The patient also had
a metabolic acidosis, which was being poorly compensated.  At
that time a family meeting was held and the gravity of his
situation was explained.  On [**2193-2-16**] the patient's family
decided to withdraw care.  The patient was extubated and
started on a morphine drip and the patient expired shortly
thereafter.  The time of death was 7:30 p.m. on [**2193-2-16**].

CAUSE OF DEATH:
Respiratory failure secondary to sepsis.

No postmortem was performed.
