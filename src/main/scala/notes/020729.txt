Pertinent Results:
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2158-12-31**] 8:57 PM
Extensive edema in the left frontal lobe extending to the corpus
callosum with rim-enhancing masses as described above. The lack
of slow diffusion suggest masses to be due to neoplasms.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2158-12-31**] 7:15 PM
Spiculated nodule within the right upper lobe, and a second
possible nodule within the left upper lobe. Further evaluation
with CT scan is recommended.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2159-1-2**] 11:12 AM
No evidence of neoplasm in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.

[**2159-1-9**] Pathology: METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA with papillary
features, some mucin production, and extensive necrosis.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: [**2159-1-6**]: Complete resection of the superior left
frontal mass and partial resection of the inferior left frontal
mass with postoperative changes at the surgical sites.  New
pneumocephalus in left frontal craniotomy.


Brief Hospital Course:
Because of change in mental status and masses with enhancement
found on head CT, patient was admitted on [**12-31**].  Patient was
loaded with dilantin, given decadron, and an MRI of brain and
spine were ordered. Neuro Oncology was also consulted.  As part
of the metastatic disease workup, a torso CT was obtained, which
was negative. Patient also previously had a bone scan and
mammogram in [**2158-8-8**], which were negative from [**Hospital **]reports.  On [**1-3**] a stereotactic brain biopsy was
obtained which showed carcinoma. On [**1-5**] the patient was taken
for craniotomy and tumor resection. Post operatively, she had
significant edema on MRI and will therefore be continued on
Decadron 2mg [**Hospital1 **] until radiosurgery has been administered.  She
is also on Dilantin right now for seizure prophylaxis and has
been started on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **].  The Keppra will need to be
increased by 250mg every 3 days to a goal of 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].  Once
Keppra is at a therapeutic dose, the Dilantin can be
discontinued.

Her mental status has greatly improved since the the surgery.
She continues to be a little slow to respond and have some
difficulty finding words at times. She has some upper and lower
extremity weakness with her triceps and iliopsoas muscles.  She
also has some gait difficulty.
