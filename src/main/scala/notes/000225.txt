HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male
with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension,
coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction,
chronic renal insufficiency who presented to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2166-4-7**] for
catheterization for management of a non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction.  He presented from an outside
hospital.  He initially presented to an outside hospital in
St. [**Doctor Last Name **] while on vacation with a left hip fracture.  While
at this outside hospital he flashed, having pulmonary edema
requiring intubation times one day.  There he ruled in for
myocardial infarction with a positive troponin.  He denied
chest pain, palpitations and loss of consciousness, only
positive for shortness of breath.  He presented to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] on
[**2166-4-7**] and was catheterized on [**2166-4-9**].  Right
atrium 12, mean right ventricle 55/14, pulmonary airway
55/25, wedge 27, mid right coronary artery discrete 80%,
distal right coronary artery discrete 80%, both of these
lesions had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
and stent.  Left main diffusely diseased 70%, mid left
anterior descending discrete 100%, collateral from an right
posterior descending artery.  Distal left anterior descending
diffusely diseased, collateral from an right posterior
descending artery.  Proximal circumflex discrete 60% lesion.
Overall impression, three vessel coronary artery disease,
status post successful stenting times two of the right
coronary artery, moderate systolic biventricular dysfunction,
elevated systolic pressure.  Echocardiogram on [**2166-4-9**],
sinus rhythm, prior anteroseptal infarct, ST segment
depression in 2, 3, and AVF, ST flattening in 1 and AVL, rate
sinus at 85, prolonged at 160, QRS at 70, QTC 416, normal
axis.  Also on the note of the patient's cardiac
catheterization, cardiac output was 3.3, index was 2, SVR was
1891.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient reports stable exertional
angina over several years, relieved with nitroglycerin.  He
has occasional nocturnal angina.  He has been chest pain free
since arrival.  Positive for fatigue.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for diabetes, 12 year history,
very brittle.  Hypertension.  Coronary artery disease with
the posterior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.  Chronic
renal insufficiency.  Distant seizure disorder, has not had
seizure for 40 years, status post prostatectomy, status post
right hip replacement, gastroesophageal reflux disease.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a former composer of music.  He lives
with his wife at [**Name (NI) 8**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home include
Atenolol, Altace, Dilantin, Zantac and Insulin.  Medications
on transfer to CCU were Aspirin 325 q.d., Lopressor 25
b.i.d., Captopril 6.25 b.i.d., Dilantin 200 q. AM, 100 q. PM,
Protonix 40 q.d., Percocet, regular insulin sliding scale and
Mucomyst 600 b.i.d. times two days, insulin Lente 16 units q.
AM.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on presentation
to the CCU, the patient was lying in bed in no acute
distress.  Extraocular movements intact.  Pupils equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  No oral
lesions.  Jugulovenous distension, angle of the mandible.
Lungs clear to auscultation, anteriorly in the upper lung
fields, decreased breathsounds laterally.  The patient was
unable to sit forward secondary to pain from his hip
fracture.  He had regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2.  He had
a high-pitched systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal
border.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  +1 dorsalis pedis pulses, no cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.  He has a deformity of the right hand.
Groin, no hematoma or bruit. Cranial nerves III through XII
intact.  Alert and oriented times three.  Good strength in
all of his extremities except for a broken leg, unable to
move it secondary to leg pain.

LABORATORY DATA:  On [**2166-4-8**], he had hematocrit of 32,
white blood cell count of 12.5, hemoglobin 10.6, platelets
152, sodium 135, potassium 4.8, chloride 100, bicarbonate 22,
BUN 57, creatinine 2.2.  His baseline seems to be
approximately 1.9 to 2.1, magnesium 1.9, calcium 8.3,
phosphorus 4.2, ALT 51, AST 21, alkaline phosphatase 201,
total bilirubin .3, INR 1.1.  On [**2166-4-8**], showed
ejection fraction 25%, gradient 41 mm of mercury, right
atrium normal size, left ventricular wall thickness was
normal, left ventricular cavity size was normal.  Overall
left ventricular function is severely depressed.  No resting
systolic outflow obstruction.  Right ventricular chamber
size, free wall motion is normal.  +1 mitral regurgitation,
although the acoustic shadow, the severity of this may be
significantly underestimated, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation,
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  So, the patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with
a past medical history of coronary artery disease,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, chronic renal
insufficiency who presents from an outside hospital with left
hip fracture, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction,
resulting in congestive heart failure and status post
extubation, status post catheterization showing increased
filling pressures and right coronary artery with stent times
two.

1.  Cardiology - Coronary artery disease, the patient had two
right coronary artery stents.  His left system was totally
occluded.  He fills collaterals from the right system from
the posterior descending artery.  The patient in the future
may benefit from left-sided intervention to open up the left
anterior descending as he is dependent on a stented vessel
for flow of both his left and right systems.  The patient
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient, his
cardiologist.  The patient was continued on Aspirin, Plavix.
He was initially on Lopressor b.i.d.  This was ramped up to
50 b.i.d. with improved control of his heartrate going from
high 80s to 90s to mid 70s.  The patient initially was on
6.25 of Captopril.  This was increased as high as 37.5 but
then discontinued and the patient experienced acute renal
failure, thought secondary to dye-induced nephropathy
approximately 48 hours after his cardiac catheterization.
The patient initially was on the Nitroglycerin and Integrilin
drip status post catheterization.  These both were turned off
by 18 hours after the catheterization.

Congestive heart failure, the patient initially presented
from the Catheterization Laboratory in congestive heart
failure with recent intubation with elevated jugulovenous
pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in
Catheterization Laboratory and bilateral pleural effusions
with an ejection fraction of 25%.  He was diuresed with
Lasix, initially printing out to 80 intravenously.  Blood
pressure was said to be fine, overloaded and eventually did
not respond to further increasing doses of Lasix until again
he had initial course complicated by acute renal failure.
The patient had dialysis times two which helped remove fluid
and improve his volume status, greatly improving the
congestive heart failure that he had been experiencing.

Rhythm, the patient was on telemetry.  He for the most part
had a normal sinus rhythm but in the contest of hyperkalemia
he had a wide complex rhythm with PTT waves, flattened Ps and
a prolonged PR interval.  The patient received four gm of
intravenous calcium gluconate, 30 mg of Kayexalate and
insulin drip which reduced his potassium from a level of 7.2
to 5.6 and resolving his electrocardiogram changes.  The
patient had hemodialysis later that day which further
improved his potassium levels as well as his acidosis and his
volume status.  As outpatient has mitral regurgitation and
tricuspid regurgitation as per his echocardiogram.

Renal - As stated previously above, the patient had renal
failure with his creatinine to 4.9, baseline is 2.2 and his
potassium going to 7.2.  The patient had bicarbonate of 15 as
well.  Renal saw the patient, it
