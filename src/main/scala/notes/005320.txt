Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for shortness of breath and ?NQWMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p angiography with removal of left femoral sheath
s/p left groin exploration with thrombectomy of left
aorta-bifemoral limb


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 62 year old female with history of CAD status
post two MIs, severe PVD s/p multiple vascular surgeries
(AO-bifem [**2160**], SWA bypass, L fem [**Doctor Last Name **] [**2168**], thrombosed right
femoral graft s/p thrombectomy/produndoplasty [**2171-9-10**], renal
artery stent), VI, AAA, left CVA, ICD placed [**2-/2164**] who was
admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] on [**2171-9-29**] for shortness of breath.  The
patient states that she has experienced three episodes of
extreme shortness of breath while at rest over the last 3
months.  The episodes always occur while at rest and are
accompanied by diaphoresis.  She denies chest pain,
palpitations, lightheadedness, or radiating discomfort.  For
each episode, which last hours throughout the entire night until
the next morning, she never takes any medications and merely
waits for the dyspnea to resolve on its own.  Before her
admission to the OSH, she had an episode as described, this time
lasting three days.  On the third day, the patient had mental
status changes and she was brought into the OSH ED for immediate
evaluation.  There she was treated with asa, nitro, and oxygen,
at which point her shortness of breath resolved.  EKG did not
reveal any ST elevations, but there was a notation of elevated
Troponin (?type) at 2.5.  CK was not reported to be elevated.
From the ED, she was admitted to the CCU where she was treated
with nitro iv, betablocker, aspiring, captopril, coumadin
(stopped and switched to lovenox), and plavix.  Her code status
was determined to be DNR/DNI.  A decision was made to send her
to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation for cath.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to cardiology service on [**2171-10-4**].  Underwent cardiac
cath via L groin sheath on [**2171-10-7**].  During procedure, she had
mental status changes--the procedure was stopped, and she had
symptoms of L sided neglect and L extremity motor dysfunction
(weakness of L arm).  She was taken to the neuro-angio suite and
had R cerebral lysis with resolution of the symptoms.  Pt had L
groin arterial sheath pulled on [**2171-10-8**].  Prior to the pull, whe
had a palpable pulse--after the pull, pressure developed, and
patient experienced pain, pallor, and loss of the L femoral
pulse.  Vascular surgery was emergently consulted for occlusion
of the L femoral artery.  The L groin was emergently explored,
with thrombectomy of the L aorto-bifem limb, with patch
angioplasty of the L common femoral artery and profunda. The
patient's heparin drip was continued. On [**2171-10-9**], the patient
was stable enough to be transferred from the ICU to the VICU.
The patient received 1 unit packed red blood cells for a falling
hematocrit (27.3).  She was restarted on coumadin, plavix and
aspirin, and transferred to the floor on [**2171-10-10**].  Physical
therapy was consulted and the patient was encouraged to get out
of bed to a chair.  On [**2171-10-12**], the heparin drip was
discontinued, as the patient was therapeutic on coumadin.  On
[**2171-10-13**], the patient was discharged to home with physical
therapy to follow the patient at home.
