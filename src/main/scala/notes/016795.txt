Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for management of pneumonia and all oncology care.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with history of right temporal
lobe glioblastoma, s/p resection and XRT, currently on
bevacizumab and dexamethasone followed by Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 724**] as
outpatient, who was sent to [**Hospital3 417**] hospital from [**Hospital1 15454**] [**Hospital1 **] in [**Location (un) 701**], MA on [**2103-5-19**] with
SOB and fevers.  CTA revealed posterior consolidations
bilaterally most consistent with pneumonia.  He was started on
imipenem/tigacycline, defervesced, requiring 3-4L of oxygen via
nasal cannula. Per ICU attending there, his imaging/presentation
did not seem consistent with PCP and serum LDH was normal at
230.  He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management and
since all of his oncology care has been coordinated by Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 724**].  Of note, his nasal swabs at [**Hospital3 417**] tested
positive for MRSA and VRE.

Upon review of OMR, he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2103-4-13**] to
[**2103-4-18**] for AMS and a positive blood culture.  He was found to
have a UTI had his urinary catheter exchanged on arrival.  Urine
cultures from [**Year/Month/Day **] was positive for ESBL Klebsiella
and pseudomonas resistant to meropenem.  Repeat urine culture
showed no growth.  Blood cultures showed no growth at the time
of discharge.  Portable chest X-ray showed no evidence of
pneumonia.  The patient was started on vancomycin, meropenem,
and ciprofloxacin, renally dosed.  His mental status and
clinical condition improved with antibiotics and fluids in the
ICU.  Vancomycin was discontinued (given patient had only 1 out
of 4 bottles positive for coag-positive staph at [**Year/Month/Day **],
with negative blood culture here).  He was discharged with
meropenem/ciprofloxacin for a goal 14 day course to be completed
on [**2103-4-26**].

On the floor here, he reports "a lot" of abdominal pain over the
past four days and continued pain in both of his legs.  He also
states that his shortness of breath is improved compared to a
few days ago.
