Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2106-4-8**]: PRE-BYPASS: 3D multiplanar reconstructions were
used for aortic root measurements. No spontaneous echo contrast
is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of
surgery.
POST-BYPASS: LV systolic function appears improved to normal
(LVEF 55%) RV systolic function remains normal. There is a well
seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position. A
tube graft is visualized in the ascending aorta. The study is
otherwise unchanged from prebypass.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated aortic sinuses measuring 5.0 cm
without effacement of the sinotubular junction. Ascending aorta
is moderately dilated to 4.8 cm and tapers down to 4.0 cm
distally. The aortic valve is trileaflet with poor coaptation.
Severe aortic regurgitation without aortic stenosis is seen.
Moderate mitral regurgitation is seen.. Mildly depressed LV
function.

CXR [**4-12**]:

Mild bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged from prior.
Bibasilar
opacities , a combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis
have increased
on the right and minimally improved on the left. The upper lungs
are clear.
There is no pneumothorax. Widened mediastinum has improved.
Cardiomegaly has

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3094**] was admitted one day before surgery for routine
work-up and Heparin since he was on Coumadin for atrial
fibrillation. On [**2106-4-8**] he was brought to the operating room
where he underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending
aorta replacement. Please see operative note for surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later this day he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
He was started on beta-blockers, diuretics and gently diuresed
towards his pre-op weight. On post-op day one he was transferred
to the step-down floor for further care. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol.  On POD2 he
developed rapid atrial fibrillation, loaded with IV/PO
amiodarone.  His beta-blocker was titrated for rate control.
His Coumadin was restarted for his history of DVT.  Prednisone 5
mg was restarted which he has been taken for several years. His
pain was well controlled with acetaminophen and low-dose
narcotics. He was seen by physical therapy for strength and
mobility.  On POD # 6 he was noted to have plebitis of left
upper extremity possibley related to amiodarone infusion. He was
started on PO keflex. In light of starting the antibiotic his
INR bumped slight and his coumadin was adjusted. This will need
to be monitored closely while he continues on the antibiotic. He
has continued to make steady progress and was ready for
discharge on POD #7. Follow-up appointments arranged.
