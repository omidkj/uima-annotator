Latino male with a history of myocardial infarction
approximately ten years ago who awoke in the AM of [**2184-10-14**] at 3 o'clock with left-sided chest pain.  He stated
that the pain was just like his pain with his myocardial
infarction in the past.  He presented to the Emergency
Department at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital.  There he was given
nitroglycerin sublingually times three, Lopressor 5 mg
intravenous push and Morphine.  He became hypotensive and was
given intravenous bolus.  His blood pressure recovered and
the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 649**] for cardiac catheterization.  His
catheterization showed an ejection fraction of 50% with mild
inferoapical hypokinesis, LM-diffuse 30% disease, left
anterior descending-50% proximal, 50% mid, TO-mid after
septal takeoff, left circumflex-mid 70%, TO-after obtuse
marginal, obtuse marginal 1-90%; right coronary artery, NO;
LPDA-TO.  The patient was assessed and was deemed appropriate
for coronary artery bypass graft on [**2184-10-15**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post myocardial infarction ten
years ago, hypercholesterolemia, status post appendectomy,
status post cholecystectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] smoked

2+, right carotids 2+, radial arteries were 2+ bilaterally,
posterior tibial 2+ bilaterally, dorsalis pedis 2+
bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT:  Assessment at that time showed a 73 year old
male with multi-vessel disease who was preopped for coronary
artery bypass graft on the morning of [**2184-10-15**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent two-vessel coronary
artery bypass graft on [**2184-10-15**] without incident and
on postoperative day #1 was started on alcohol drip for
history of alcohol and was started on low dose Lopressor at
12.5 twice a day.  The patient was on a Neo-Synephrine drip
at 1.5 and insulin drip 3, as well as alcohol drip.  On
postoperative day #2, the mediastinal chest tube was
discontinued.  However, the left pleural chest tube was kept
in place.  The Lopressor was increased to 50 b.i.d. for
increasing heartrate to 90s.  Physical therapy began seeing
the patient on postoperative day #2, and continued to see the
patient throughout the hospital course.  By postoperative day
#3, the patient was given Amiodarone bolus and Lopressor was
increased to 75 b.i.d. for rapid atrial fibrillation to a
heartrate of 125, and the patient was off of the alcohol drip
at this point and continued on p.o. alcohol one q.d. which
was then supplemented with Thiamine and Folate.  On
postoperative day #4 the patient remained in atrial
fibrillation at a rate of 112 and Electrophysiology and the
Division of Cardiology was consulted and recommended
continuation of the Amiodarone and recommended changing to
oral dose of 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times one week and then 400
mg q.d. times two weeks and then 200 mg p.o. q.d.
Electrophysiology also recommended direct current
cardioversion for conversion to normal sinus rhythm once the
patient was adequately anticoagulated with intravenous
heparin with PTT of between 50 and 80, and then initiation of
Coumadin.

On postoperative day #5 the Neo-Synephrine drip began to be
weaned and between postoperative day #5 and 7, Neo-Synephrine
drip continued to be weaned and was off on postoperative day
#7.  The patient was on Aspirin and Plavix therapy by
postoperative day #8 and was then on 400 mg of Amiodarone
q.d. for control of atrial fibrillation.  By postoperative
day #9 the patient was doing extremely well and was
discharged home without event.
