History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 y.o. M wih ESRD on HD [**3-5**] amyloidosis, history
of MRSA bacteremia in [**6-/2134**] and [**10/2134**], MRSA endocarditis in
[**7-/2134**], prior paravertebral abscess in [**6-/2134**] s/p washout,
pulmonary aspergillus (treated with itraconazole for many
years), hepatitis C, sarcoid, and amyloid, who initially
presented on [**2135-1-14**] with fatigue and anorexia after HD on the
day prior to admission per his fiance. This was worrisome to his
fiance as this was how he presented when he was admitted for
sepsis.
.
In the ED, the patient complained of low back and abdominal
pain. ED VS: T 101, BP 50/30, HR 130s, sating well on 2L NC. No
central access obtained after several attempts. Right EJ placed,
and the patient was given 5L NS and started on levophed with
improvement of SBP to 100s. Broad antibiotic coverage of
vancomycin/zosyn/flagyl. CT of the abdomen/pelvis did not show
any intraabdominal pathology. He was admitted to the MICU for
management of sepsis.
.
In the MICU, the patient was started on pressors and then weaned
off of them. He had [**5-6**] blood cultures positive for MRSA and
gentamicin was added for additional synergy. He was also
evaluated by renal, ID, and CT surgery. He improved and was felt
to be stable for floor management.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, he was continued on vanco dosed with
HD and gent dosed by level. He was also continued on
voriconazole for pulmonary aspergillosis. He was transferred
from [**Location **] service to West medical service on the
evening of [**1-20**] for ease of HD. Shortly after transfer,
covering team was called for "blood tinged sputum". He
reportedly had several (at least 2) episodes of increasing blood
in his sputum to include large clots and ? of pulmonary tissue
per covering team. Hct was checked and revealed 5 point drop.
CXR was obtained which on wet read showed some increased in ?RLL
opacity, however, was not otherwise markedly changed from prior.
Throughout all of this, he maintained O2 sats in the high 90s on
RA. He was dialyzed [**1-20**] and SBPs were running 90s after HD
(prior to hemoptysis) which is down slightly from recent BL in
low 100s. Also of note, he was hypothermic requiring bear hugger
following HD. He received 500cc NS bolus on the floor and 1U
prbcs was hung. He was transferred to MICU west in the setting
of hemoptysis, elevated INR and 5 point drop on hct.
.
Of note, the patient was admitted with an epidural cervical
spine abscess that was drained on [**2134-6-24**]. He completed [**3-11**]
weeks of IV vancomcyin. He was readmitted on [**2134-10-4**] with altered
mental status and found to have high grade MRSA
bacteremia/sepsis. Femoral HD catheter was changed and treated
with 6 more weeks of IV vancomcyin and 2 weeks of gentamicin for
history of endocarditis. Of note, a vegetation was seen on his
mitral valve. From [**10-12**] - [**2134-10-20**], the patient was admitted for
SOB and chest pain that had resolved in the ED, but was found to
have pulmonary edema. He was sent to HD, where he developed
hemoptysis and respiratory distress and was intubated.
Hemoptysis was thought to be due to hemorrhagic PNA in setting
of uremic platelets. His sputum grew out MRSA, but also
concerned for secondary infection with gram negatives and
aspergillosis (given his history). He was treated with
meropenem, vancomycin, and gentamicin as well as his
itraconazole that he was on as an outpatient. He was extubated
and gentamicin was stopped. Meropenem was switched to levaquin
to complete a 7 day course. A beta glucan was positive, and so
he was switched to voriconazole fo better apsergillosis
coverage. During this prior admission, he also had a negative
TTE and surveillance cultures that remained negative.
.
ROS: No changes in weight. No fevers, chills. No
lightheadedness/dizziness. No CP. No SOB. No abdominal pain/N/V.
No rashes.

STUDIES (since admission):
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2135-1-14**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild pulmonary interstitial edema, improved since [**2134-10-17**].
2. Previously seen airspace opacity in the right lung base also
no longer evident.
3. Extensive pleural, nodal and parenchymal calcification,
likely reflects combination of asbestos-exposure, old
granulomatous disease and "metastatic calcification" related to
the patient's renal disease.
.
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2135-1-14**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection or acute vascular
abnormality or
retroperitoneal hematoma to explain hypotension.
2. Extensive calcifications are likely secondary to a
combination of prior granulomatous disease, asbestos exposure,
or metastatic calcification.
3. Chronic consolidation in the upper lungs is unchanged since
[**2134-10-12**].
4. Areas of peripheral wedge-shaped enhancement in an atrophic
left lobe of the liver may be perfusion abnormalities in
cirrhosis, but are not definitively characterized on a
single-phase examination.
5. Right renal transplant is considerably atrophic, new since
prior CT performed 10/[**2132**].
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2135-1-15**]
IMPRESSION: Stable examination. Low lung volumes, pleural
plaques. No focal airspace disease.
.
