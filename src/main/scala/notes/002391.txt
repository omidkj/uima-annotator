Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Atrial flutter ablation on [**2189-3-24**]
s/p cardiac catheterization on [**2189-3-26**]

History of Present Illness:
71 year old male with no known cardiac history and likely [**Hospital 2182**]
transferred from OSH with afib with RVR (vs aflutter), EKG
suggestive of past MI and 9 beat run of VTach.  Patient
travelled to South America 3 weeks prior to admission where he
developed shortness of breath, cough.  Patient denies any fever,
although this was documented in OSH records.  He was on an 11
day trip to [**Location (un) 72427**] and Patagonia with his fiancee.  He
noted dyspnea on exertion when he was carrying luggage on a 95
degree day.  He states his symptoms seemed to be intermittent,
although he admits that they probably never completely resolved
and have persisted since.  Symptom onset was approximately 3
weeks ago.  He returned home around [**2189-3-9**] and thought his
symptoms were getting better.  However, noted non-productive
cough, dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea which seemed to be
worsening and his fiancee convinced him to go to the [**Location (un) 59322**] ED.  He did not c/o chest pain, fever or palpitations,
although he was found to be in AFib with RVR.  His EKG was
notable for poor r wave progression, nonspecific T wave changes
suggestive of possible old anterior MI.  His troponin was
negative. His CXR and Chest CT showed mild interstitial edema
and hyperinflated lungs (possible COPD, mild CHF).  Echo done
showed EF 30%.  He was started on Cardizem gtt and continued at
8mg/hr although HR remains 100-120's in AFib.  He was also
started on heparin and coumadin, but the coumadin was stopped on
[**3-21**] when INR 3.1 given possible transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
cath.  On [**3-20**], he had a 9 beat run of VTach.

[**3-26**] Cardiac Catheterization:
report not finalized

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old male with HTN, hyperlipidemia, possible CAD (EKG
with poor R wave progression, EF 30%) transferred from OSH with
Atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation.
.
#. CAD - no known CAD although patient with risk factors: former
tobacco, EKG with poor R wave progression, EF 30%.  Continued
aspirin and statin dose increased from 10 to 40mg qday.  Holding
on ACE Inhibitor during hospitalization.  He underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**3-26**] with stents placed to LAD and left
circumflex coronary arteries.
.
#. Pump - Echo at OSH with EF 30%.  Held ACE Inhibitor in
setting of cardiac catheterization.  Mild volume overload on
admission resolved with lasix.  Patient should likely have
repeat ECHO as outpatient.
.
#. Rhythm - In Atrial flutter on admission that was very
difficult to rate/rhythm control despite diltiazem drip and
beta-blockers.  He underwent atrial flutter ablation on [**3-24**].
He converted to sinus rhythm, but then [**Doctor First Name **] into atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  He under went
cardiac catheterization as above (once INR < 1.5) and load on
amiodarone in the CCU post-cath.  On [**3-27**], he converted to sinus
rhythm on amiodarone and beta-blockers.  He was monitored on
telemetry throughout hospitalization.  Coumadin was held prior
to cathaterization and he was bridged with heparin drip during
this time.  Coumadin was started post-cath.  His INR on
discharge was 1.8.  He is to bridge with lovenox at home and
have outpatient primary care physician follow INR as outpatient
and adjust coumadin, stop lovenox once INR therapeutic. He is to
continue amiodarone taper as outpatient.
.
# COPD - started on advair and combivent inhalers at OSH.  Also
underwent pulmonary function tests at OSH.
.
#. PPx: anticoagulated on heparin gtt/coumadin, PPI
.
#. FULL CODE
.
#. Dispo: patient was discharged to home with primary care and
cardiology follow-up.  He was instructed to have INR blood
levels drawn every 3 days as an outpatient until INR
therapeutic.  He will bridge with lovenox until INR therapeutic
and received lovenox teaching.  He is to continue amiodarone
taper as outpatient.
