HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  66-year-old male with history of
tracheal stenosis status post multiple T-tubes, dilatations,
and ablations, history of coronary artery disease, congestive
heart failure, history of pulmonary effusion in [**1-/2125**],
history of seizure disorder, history of adrenal
insufficiency, who recently was discharged from [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2125-8-30**] secondary to
removal of left main stem bronchus stent.  Granulation tissue
had overgrown causing obstruction of stent and retention of
secretions, necessitating removal.

On Friday, [**2125-8-30**], patient continued to cough with
minimal hemoptysis.  Overnight from Friday to Saturday
patient's hemoptysis and cough increased with copious
secretions and blood with phlegm being coughed up.  Patient
unable to sleep for three nights because of cough.  Cough now
severe and persistent enough that patient began having left
lower quadrant abdominal pain.  Only has abdominal pain with
cough.  Also complaining of shortness of breath but denies
chest pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, and chills, as well as
headache.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Hemoptysis:  It is very likely that cause of patient's
hemoptysis was a consequence of recent stent removal that he
had not too long ago.  Likely the patient might have had a
mucosal tear as a consequence of the removal or some mucosal
irritation.  He was admitted to the floor, had blood typed
and screen, and kept on oxygen to keep sat above 92%.
Lovenox and Coumadin were held overnight for procedure.
Patient was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit secondary to the hypoxia.  He had bronchoscopy done
inside the MICU which showed a small left main tear with
large amount of purulent secretions that were evacuated on
day of procedure.  Patient was started on piperacillin,
tazobactam, and gentamicin for negative rods seen on
bronchoalveolar lavage.  Patient's hemoptysis resolved on day
two of admission, day one of admission to the MICU.  Patient
was subsequently started on Vicodin to inhibit cough and
allow the mucosal linings of the bronchus to heal.

2.  Hypoxia:  The following day after admission the patient
was noted to have a seizure with development of chest pain,
tachypnea, shortness of breath with sats dropping to 85% on
nasal cannula.  Patient was changed to face mask then without
success, and then changed to a nonrebreather.  His oxygen
requirement was increased to 2 liters on nonrebreather with
improvement of oxygen saturations to 90%.  EKG at time was
taken and noted to be normal with no ST elevations or
depression.  Patient's chest pain subsided with sublingual
nitroglycerin but developed pleuritic chest pain and
continued to desat while talking.

MICU team was notified and subsequently transferred.  Patient
was intubated and placed on mechanical intubation to maintain
good oxygen saturation.  MICU stay was complicated by
hypotension and oliguria which were treated with fluids and
pressors.  The patient's status improved by days 2 and 3 of
MICU admission, eliminating the need for pressors and
subsequently extubating patient once procedures were done
from the Pulmonary team.

Patient's hypoxia was secondary to atelectasis of left lung
secondary to mucus plug or blood clot.  Bronchoscopy showed a
large mucus plug causing the atelectasis.  CT of airway
showed mucosal tear.  Patient was extubated with good
maintenance of saturations and subsequently transferred to
the Medicine floor.

3.  Pain:  Patient was continued on his outpatient regimen
with good results.

4.  Gout:  Patient was continued on his Allopurinol without
any acute flares in house.

5.  Seizure disorder:  Patient had a seizure on day two of
admission.  Phenytoin levels were checked everyday, and
Dilantin was adjusted to keep patient at therapeutic levels.
No other seizures were noted.

6.  Fungal infections on feet:  Triamcinolone and Fluconazole
were continued while in house.

7.  Depression:  Patient was continued in Nefazodone and
Imipramine.

8.  Congestive heart failure:  Patient's desaturation were a
consequence of the atelectasis caused by the large mucus plug
found in the left main stem bronchus.  Otherwise there was no
clinical or radiographic evidence of congestive heart
failure.  Patient was continued on Metoprolol and Furosemide.

9.  Adrenal insufficiency:  Patient lives on the baseline of
40 mg of Prednisone q. day.  Patient was continued on
Prednisone in house and once transferred to the MICU was
converted to an equal dose of hydrocortisone.  Once stable
and transferred to the floor, patient was replaced on
original dose of 40 mg of Prednisone.

10.  Heme:  Hematocrit was stable throughout stay with no
further hemoptysis noted by day two of admission.

11.  ID:  Patient maintained low-grade temperatures for two
to three nights which resolved two days prior to admission.
Patient was noted to have a peak white blood cell count of
14.2 with evidence of gram negative rods on bronchi-alveolar
lavage growing out Pseudomonas and Staph aureus.  Patient was
initially started on piperacillin, tazobacta
