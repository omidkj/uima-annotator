vary.

IMAGING:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2127-4-29**] 10:16 PM

AP UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: There is increasing faint
opacity in the left mid lung, suggestive of an infectious
process. There is a large
retrocardiac hiatal hernia. There is bibasilar atelectasis. A
small left
pleural effusion is also new. There is no pneumothorax or
pulmonary edema.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged in size,
unchanged. IMPRESSION:
1. Left mid lung pneumonia. A followup radiograph to document
resolution is recommended. Small left pleural effusion.
2. Large hiatal hernia.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2127-5-1**] 2:39 PM
AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct
comparison
with the next preceding similar study obtained 10 hours earlier
during the
same day. The patient remained intubated, the tube in unchanged
position.
The same holds for the previously described right internal
jugular approach central venous line. On previous chest
examinations observed perivascular haze ([**4-30**], 3:44 hours and
[**5-1**], 4:57 hours) has regressed, thus less evidence of CHF. No
new parenchymal infiltrates are identified. No pneumothorax has
developed. Observed that patient was difficult to examine and
left lateral chest wall is not completely included in image
field. IMPRESSION: Improvement of pulmonary congestive pattern
in comparison with next preceding chest examinations.

ECHO [**2127-5-2**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is
asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The le
