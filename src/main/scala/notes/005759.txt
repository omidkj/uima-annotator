Reason: Eval for effusion



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   69 year old man s/p MVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   Eval for effusion



Provisional Findings Impression: SP [**Doctor First Name **] [**2173-11-18**] 3:12 PM
Stable chest findings. No pneumothorax has developed. Pleural
density and
atelectasis unchanged.


Final Report
TYPE OF EXAMINATION: Chest AP portable single view.

INDICATION: Status post mitral valve replacement, evaluate for
effusion.

FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in
sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct
comparison
with the next preceding similar study of [**2173-11-15**]. The
patient
remains extubated. The next previous examination still present
right-sided
central venous line has been removed. No pneumothorax has
developed. The
accessible portion of the pulmonary vasculature does not
demonstrate increased
congestion and no new infiltrates are identified. The left-sided

diaphragmatic contour remains obliterated by a mostly linear
density
suggestive of atelectasis and some pleural effusion. This
finding has not
undergone any significant interval change. Heart size appears
unaltered, and
the same holds for the appearance of annuloplasty.

IMPRESSION: Stable findings.

Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2173-11-14**]



OBJECT: Bedside ltm video ekg [**Date range (1) 84047**]. THERE WAS ONE
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATION. ROUTINE SAMPLING AND SPIKE AND SEIZURE
DETECTION
PROGRAMS WERE UTILIZED.


REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 900**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]


FINDINGS:
ROUTINE SAMPLING: Showed a slow background in the theta and
delta range
with additional bursts of generalized slowing in the delta
range. There
were no areas of prominent focal slowing or epileptiform
features seen.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed no epileptic activity.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were 40 entries in these files
for
muscle artifacts, chewing artifacts, as well as electrode
artifacts.
There was no ongoing seizure activity seen in these files.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There was one for unclear reasons.
However,
there was no epileptic activity correlated with this pushbutton
activation.
SLEEP: There were no normal sleep patterns seen in this
recording.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured one pushbutton activation
for an
unclear reason with no EEG correlate. There were no ictal or
interictal
epileptiform features seen in this recording. The background
activity
was slow suggestive of encephalopathy. There were no areas of
prominent
focal slowing.

as right caudate head areas of restricted diffusion, suggestive
of _____
global hypoxic event. No midline shift or hydrocephalus. Soft
tissue changes
both mastoid air cells, likely secondary to intubation.


Final Report
EXAM: MRI of the brain.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with status post MVR and ascending
aorta
replacement, assess for CVA.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion
axial images
of the brain were acquired.

FINDINGS: There are bilateral diffuse predominantly cortical
areas of
restricted diffusion seen in both frontal, parietal and
occipital lobes with
restricted diffusion in the right caudate head. There is no
midline shift,
mass effect, or hydrocephalus seen. There is no evidence of
acute or chronic
blood products.

diffusion, suggestive
of global hypoxic event. No midline shift or hydrocephalus. Soft
