Admission Date: [**2121-3-13**]        Discharge Date:[**2121-4-3**]

Date of Birth:  [**2064-12-4**]        Sex:  M

Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year old
gentleman with a history of end stage renal disease on
hemodialysis since [**2120-10-11**], coronary artery disease,
hypertension and diabetes.  He had been recently admitted in
[**2121-2-11**] to an outside hospital with an MSSA bacteremia
thought to be caused by an infected PermCath.  At that time,
the patient had the PermCath removed, and he was treated with
an antibiotic course of nafcillin and appeared to recover
uneventfully.  On [**2121-3-10**], the patient presented at
an outside hospital complaining of shortness of breath, lower
extremity edema, and a "cold foot."  During his extensive
workup at the outside hospital, he was started on
antibiotics.  The complaint of back pain led to an MRI which
demonstrated no epidural abscess, and he underwent an
echocardiogram which demonstrated a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 60 percent and significant mitral regurgitation.
He also underwent a cardiac catheterization, which
demonstrated a left circumflex artery stenosis of 70 percent.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for consideration of surgery for mitral valve
endocarditis, coronary artery disease, and evaluation for his
cold left leg.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. End stage renal disease on hemodialysis since [**Month (only) 359**]
   [**2120**].
2. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction.
3. Peripheral vascular disease.
4. Hypertension.
5. Diabetes.
6. MSSA bacteremia, mitral valve endocarditis, severe mitral
   regurgitation.
7. Diverticulitis.
8. Congestive heart failure.
9. Malnutrition with serum albumin 1.9.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Eye surgery.
2. PermCath placement.


MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Calcium carbonate 500 mg p.o.
t.i.d.
Fentanyl patch 50 ug over 72 hours.
Colace.
Insulin sliding scale.
Nafcillin.
Gentamicin.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.
Protonix 40 mg p.o. daily.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco use or EtOH use.
He is an auto mechanic.

Vital signs on admission - temperature was 97.1, heart rate
101, blood pressure 88/58, with a mean of 64.  Breathing 10,
100 percent on room air.  Preoperative weight is 72 kg.

The patient is in no acute distress.  His chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  His heart was regular, with a
III/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex.  His abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended.  His left foot was cold and
mottled, with a capillary refill greater than five seconds.
He had two plus carotid pulses, two plus radial pulses, two
plus femoral, and he had triphasic signals on the right
popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis, and he had
a monophasic popliteal on the left, with no signals over his
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis.  His left foot
strength - his dorsiflexion and extension were [**1-15**] on the
left, and he had no sensation to the mid calf.

On laboratories, his white count was 12.2, hematocrit 27.6,
platelets 213.  His sodium was 129, potassium 5.0, chloride
90, bicarbonate 26, BUN 43, creatinine 6.5, glucose 145.  The
troponin was 3.52. Albumin 1.9.

On radiographic studies, he had an echocardiogram at the
outside hospital which showed ejection fraction of 60 percent
and [**3-14**] plus mitral regurgitation.  Cardiac catheterization
demonstrated a 70 percent lesion at the left circumflex, 36
percent lesion of the LM, and a 35 percent lesion of the RCA.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the cardiac
surgery service, and on the day of admission, the patient was
taken to the operating room, where he underwent enbolectomy of
the lower extremity by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 27226**], followed later in the day by
a mitral
valve replacement with a 29 mm CE porcine valve, a coronary
artery bypass graft x one, with SVG to OM, and a left lower
extremity thrombectomy with patch closure and a lower
extremity angiography.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the cardiac surgery intensive
care unit for his postoperative care.

In the intensive care unit, the patient was weaned to
extubation.  His pressor support was weaned appropriately.
He received transfusions for postoperative anemia, and at
this point his hematocrit has remained stable.  The
nephrology team has been following him, and began initially
continuous venous hemofiltration and dialysis, and as he
improved and recovered from his surgery, this was replaced
with typical hemodialysis.  The transplant team has placed a
new PermCath, and his temporary dialysis line has been
removed at this point.

He was treated initially with a broad spectrum antibiotic
course, and this has been tailored by the infectious disease
team. His cultures have remained negative to date in the
hospital, and his only positive cultures were the MSSA, which
grew out from an outside hospital.  All tissue cultures, as
well, have been negative.  He underwent a bone scan to
determine if there were any septic emboli, and there were
none demonstrated on the scan.  The patient was transferred
to the floor and his recovery continued, and he has received
physical therapy, nutritional consultation, and has been
making good recovery strides.  A PICC line was placed for his
five week course of antibiotics recommended to treat his
bacterial endocarditis.  All of his other lines and drains
have been removed as appropriate.  He does have a permanent
PermCath, which remains.

He is now postoperative day twenty and two, and is ready for
discharge to rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Bacterial endocarditis status post mitral valve
   replacement.

10. Severe malnutrition.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1. Status post mitral valve replacement with 29 mm porcine
   valve.

INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to receive liver function tests
once a week after discharge until antibiotics stop, a
creatinine once a week after discharge until antibiotics
stop, CBC once a week after discharge until antibiotics stop.
These should be faxed to the primary medical doctor and the
infectious disease team.  He can call the infectious disease
team for followup.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two
weeks.  He should call for an appointment.  The patient will
also follow up with ID and primary medical doctors.  Should
call for an appointment.

DISPOSITION:  Stable, and will go to rehab for further care.
