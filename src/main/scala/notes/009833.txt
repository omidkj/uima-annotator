Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
admitted for charcot joint reconstruction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
surgical reconstruction/repair of charcot joint


History of Present Illness:
56yo F with a hx of unclear bleeding diathesis, as well as
diastolic CHF and DM complicated by charcot foot deformity was
admitted on [**2123-4-5**] and underwent reconstruction of L charcot
foot on [**2123-4-10**]. The delay between the time of admission and OR
was secondary to swelling of the LLE believed to be secondary to
her Charcot deformity. She was intubated for the OR on [**4-10**] for
a total of 5 hours. At the recommendation of the heme/onc
service, the pt was given ddAVP 30mcg/kg IV prior to OR for her
bleeding diathesis. During the op, the pt was given 2units PRBCs
and 3 liters of LR with a significant amount of blood loss
intraoperatively per the podiatry resident est. 750 cc + and
urine output of 400cc/5 hours intra-operatively (for net of
positive of over 3.5 liters positive).

Post op, the patient complained of left sided upper anterior
chest pain without radiation which was reproducible with
palpation and felt to be secondary to a device placed in the
exact location of her pain used to prop her during the
procedure. She was given morphine with relief of pain. At the
time, her HR was 70, BP: 160/60, SaO2: 100% (but unclear amount
of supplemental oxygen, RN nursing notes her SaO2 to be 98% on
3L at time of acceptance from PACU). Her CV exam was RRR, S1,
S2, no m/r/g and lung exam was CTA bilaterally. No JVP or LE
edema was mentioned on exam.

Subsequently the pt was given lasix 40mg IV x1 over night for
her positive fluid status. A CXR was obtained at that time which
confirmed pulmonary edema on [**2123-4-10**].

Physical Exam:
Tc=101.8 P= 86 BP=108/48 RR=20 88-100% on nasal BIPAP
.
GEN: Initially, mild-moderate respiratory distress with
accessory SCM use bilaterally, AOX2 (thought she was at [**Hospital 107**]
Hospital in [**Hospital1 1559**], MA)
HEENT: 12 cm JVP, nasal BIPAP, PERRLA
CV: RRR, S1, S2
Chest: Bilateral diffuse rhonchi with mild expiratory wheezes
Abd: NT, ND +BS
Ext: LLE in tight ACE wrap s/p left charcot reconstruction


Pertinent Results:
Foot and ankle films [**4-5**]: Extensive neuropathic changes with
paraspinous of the foot and extensive soft tissue swelling.
.
ECG [**2123-4-6**]: NSR at 70, left [**Hospital1 **] axis, Q in III, no ST changes,
TW flatteningn in L, TWI in V2 to v3, poor R wave progression.
.
CT lower extrem [**4-6**]: Extensive Charcot changes throughout the
left hindfoot, with rocker- bottom deformity, without
significant change from the radiograph dated [**2123-2-25**], and
[**2123-4-5**].
.
Left LENI [**4-6**]: No evidence of DVT within the left lower
extremity from the popliteal vein through the common femoral
vein.
.
[**4-10**] CXR: Lung volumes are lower today and borderline pulmonary
edema is new. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. What is most
noteworthy is interval widening of the mediastinum, particularly
in the right lower paratracheal region. Since there is no
contralateral tracheal shift to suggest the mass effect
generally seen from hematoma. I suspect this is due to vascular
overload alone. I suggest careful followup following diuresis to
exclude conditions such as aortic dissection and if central
venous line was placed or attempted in the interim, mediastinal
hematoma. The esophagus is distended with air above the level of
the carina and could be the cause of pain.
.
ECG [**2123-4-10**]: NSR at 80, leftward axis, Q in III, no ST changes,
TW flattening in III, TWI in V2 to v4, poor R wave progression.

.
[**4-11**] CXR: Lung volumes remain low, but pulmonary vascular
congestion has improved since [**4-10**]. Mediastinal veins remain
dilated. The heart is moderately enlarged. There is no
appreciable pleural effusion or indication of pneumothorax.
.
[**4-12**] Foot and ankle films: Limited secondary to overlying cast.
The patient is status post subtalar and first ray fusion as
described above.
.
[**4-17**] CXR: Upper lungs are clear. Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
Consolidation at the left lung base has worsened since [**4-10**],
stable since [**4-12**], and less pronounced opacification at the
right lung base has worsened since [**4-12**]. Findings are
consistent with atelectasis but pneumonia cannot be excluded.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
.
[**4-18**] CXR: 1. Slight interval improvement in left lower lobe
consolidation.
2. Improvement in opacity at the right lung base which may
partly be due to differences in patient rotation.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the Podiatry service:

**PODIATRY COURSE**
POD #1, the pt was found to have a low grade temp of 100.4 with
HR: 76, BP: 112/60 and RR: 20 with SaO2: 97% on 3L. Her lung
exam was significant for crackles at bases bilaterally. Her
ins/outs were as follows: IVF: 380 and PO: 240 for total of: 630
and Outs: 1350. She was given another dose of ddAVP 30mg IV x1
as well as lasix 60mg IV x1. During the course of the day, she
did not diurese appropriately, and continued to have crackles at
her bases bilaterally resulting in another dose of lasix 120mg
IV x1 at noon. On [**2123-4-11**], despite diuresis with lasix, her
urine output remained low at 40 cc/hr. Her creatinine rose from
0.9 to 1.2.

As this did not result in much improvement a med consult was
called for evaluation for diuresis. Medical consult recommended
transfer to medicine on [**4-11**] but at the time of evaluation, she
was felt to be in respiratory distress. The MICU was called for
further evaluation.

An ABG and stat CXR were obtained at that time around 4 pm.
Initial ABG on BIPAP with O2 sats of 94% was:

7.43/46/32/53 on BIPAP, sat 94%.

Repeat ABG [**11-16**] an hour later on the same settings of BIPAP was
as follows:

7.45/42/30/68, lactate 1.1

CXR on [**2123-4-11**] was consistent with pulmonary edema.

**MICU COURSE**
The patient was then transferred to the MICU for further
evaluation. Her O2 sats dropped to 88% and her nasal BIPAP was
tightened and readjusted. An ABG with O2 sats of 88% was
improved at:

7.53/33/198/28/198

Her O2 sat rose with adjustment of her BIPAP to 100%. The
patient was given 5 mg metolaxone and 60 mg IV lasix in the MICU
and put out 190 cc of urine.  She diuresed well overnight and
was 1.5 L negative during her 18 hours in the MICU.  In the
morning her hematocrit had continued to slowly trend down to 24,
and she received 1 U PRBC followed by lasix and metolazone.  She
was called out to the floor the morning after arrival in the
MICU.

**FLOOR COURSE**
...
On the floor, the patient was diuresed with further improvement
in her oxygenation.  Once she was at her baseline in terms of
pulmonary status, her home regimen of PO lasix was restarted.
Her blood pressure was well-controlled.  Following her
transfusion of PRBC in the MICU, her hematocrit remained s
