History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with widely metastatic (including an
infiltrating mass in his stomach) melenoma unresponsive to IL-2,
s/p cycle 1 dacarbazine [**5-11**], admitted from the ED after
reporting to an OSH with complaints of acute dyspnea.  He
reports that he was at his BL of DOE within 15 feet following
his discharge on [**6-1**] (see below) until about 3 days ago.  At
that time, he noted that at the top of his spiral stairs, he
became acutely SOB and fell to the floor.  He denies CP, LH,
palpitations, LOC, localized weakness.  He did soil himself
during this.  Over the next two days, he had similar episodes
every time he tried to get out of bed.  After he was on the
ground, he would transiently be unable to move because of the
SOB.  He would improve after laying on his left side for 20-30
seconds.  He would invariably lose control of either his bowels
or urine while on the floor while trying to catch his breath.
He reports the last time it happened at the OSH ED, he was being
sat up without exerting himself.  He was scheduled to see his
oncologist for taxol infusion today, but this happened again so
he was instructed to present to an OSH, where he was noted to
have melena and a HCT of 24.  He was given 1 U pRBCs at the OSH
and transferred here.  He denies any change of his chronic
fevers and nightsweats.  He denies N/V, change in his abd pain,
focal weakness, seizure activity, postictal state.  He denies
change in his cough and he denies hemoptysis.  He has no
dysuria.  He also says he had constipation with no bowel
movement for about 4 days.  He added a stool softener about [**2-23**]
days ago and subsequently had 5 bowel movements.  His last BM
was this morning.

He recently was admitted from [**5-25**] to [**6-1**] on the oncology
service.  He was admitted for worsening dyspnea and ongoing
upper GI bleed.  He was initially admitted to the MICU where he
was determined to be HD stable and was treated supportively for
his dyspnea, fatigue, RUQ pain (from liver mets), N/V.  His
dyspnea was felt to be [**2-22**] to his metastatic melanoma and he was
found to have a left mainstem endobornchial tumor.  It was
debrided but not stentable.  Repeat CXR showed improvement.  He
was felt to have a slow upper GI bleed, was transfused one unit
prior to discharge (HCT on d/c was 25) and he was continued on
his home PPI.  He was also given a dose of taxol on the day of
discharge.  Hospice was discussed but he felt he wanted another
round of chemotherapy to possibly prolong his life and alleviate
symptoms.  He was DNR/DNI except brief reversal for his bronch.
He was also tachycardic during his stay, felt [**2-22**] malignancy and
pulm stimuli.  He had a negative CTA at OSH and no effusion by
ECHo at OSH.  He also had low grade fevers during his stay with
no clear souce for infection, but because of a possibility of
post-obstructive pna, he was given an 8 day course of
levofloxacin.

In our ED, he was noted to have a HCT of 24 despite the unit he
received at the OSH.  He denied hemoptysis or trouble breathing
above his recent DOE.  He was tachy 110 to 115.  An 18G and 2
20G IVs were placed.  He was T/C and consented, though not
transfused bc pRBCs had not arrived.  GI was made aware and
recommended NG lavage (not done downstairs).  They saw him upon
arrival and felt that he did not need an EGD at this time both
because it is unlikely he has a brisk bleed at this point and
there would be little to do for a slow bleed from the implanted
tumor.  If he bled briskly, they would recommend EGD but more
for the possibility that there could be something else fixable
to intervene on.

Past Medical History:
HTN
COPD - used albuterol inhaler
Metastatic Melenoma: symptoms [**12-29**] melena
DX:[**2-4**] after UGI Bleed when endoscopy showed gastric mass, 2
moles on back bx and confirmed as melenoma.
STAGING: CT Torso - multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules with a
dominant mass in the LLL. LLL mass biopsy c/w melanoma. PET-CT
on [**2101-2-21**] was notable for FDG-avid adenopathy in the mediastinum
and left suprahilar region, multiple bilateral lung nodules,
multiple liver lesions, a lymph node adjacent to the pancreatic
head, and an "extremely" avid lesion in the greater curvature of
the mid-body of the stomach.  There was also FDG avidity in
C2/C3 posterior elements, the right medial ilium, and the left
inferior pubic ramus. An MRI of the brain was negative.
TREATMENT: HD IL-2 here at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 86250**] (received 8
of 14 doses) and [**Date range (1) 86251**]/10 (received 9 of 14 doses). Limited
by acute renal failure and dyspnea. Failed. Tumor progressed.
Started [**2101-5-11**] Dacarbazine, cycle 1.

Social History:
Partner, [**Name (NI) **]. Quit smoking [**12/2100**], prior > 100  pack smoker.
Prior alcohol use up to 12 cases of beer per week, now none.
Prior to illness was the call center manager of a catalog
company.

Mother - lung cancer, death 30s, she was a smoker

ECHO [**2101-6-8**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is

with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
