Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
trach change


History of Present Illness:
50 y/o male with a h/o squamous cell cancer of vallecula s/p XRT
and tonsillar cancer w/ recent initiation of XRT and
chemo,history of cirrohsis,history of seizure disorder on meds,
history of trach and PEG, who is transferred from [**Hospital **] Rehab
with lethargy and hypotension. He had recent admission [**Date range (1) 103489**]
for 2nd cycle of chemo/XRT which involved continued treatment of
a pneumonia that had been diagnosed at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. His sputum
grew multidrug resistant Klebsiella so abx were changed to
meropenem and discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab and completed course on
[**2189-3-25**].
.
Prior to this admission, per family and ED records pt has been
noted to have lethargy and over the past few days with sBP's in
the 80's. This time she states he finished the meropenem on [**3-25**]
and on [**3-27**] he became more lethargic and then [**3-28**] began bringing
up more sputum from his trach. She states he has not been
tolerating tube feeds for the few days PTA(was having nausea and
vomiting) and so these have been held for most of the weekend.
IVF were also held over the past few days.
.
She states at baseline (when he is on abx) he is up and walking
around and able to care for his G tube on his own. He used to be
able to talk with a passey muir valve, but last week his trach
was downsized to a smaller one that does not allow him to talk.
This has been very frustrating to him.
.
On arrival to the ED BP was 90/58 but then dropped to 74/41. 4L
of NS were hung but the patient only received approx 1L NS
before being transferred to the MICU. On arrival to the MICU BP
was 135/75. In the ED he received cefepime 1g IV, Vancomycin 1gm
IV. Wife states pt has had difficulty with edema in his legs in
the past, and thus NS boluses were stopped and pt was placed on
D5NS at 75 hour x 1L.
.
He is now stabilized in the MICU and transferred to the floor.
.
MICU course:
-ID- His was found to have MRSA and resistent Klebsiella on
sputum. ID was also consulted. His abx was changed to meropenem
and vancomycin. This was c/b leukopenia likely [**1-23**] to meropenem.
His WBC has been decreasing from 4K to 1.6K today.
-Pulm- Given his sputum and [**Month/Day (2) 65**] sputum and infection, his trach
was upsized to facilitate suction.
-Heme- His was found to have clot in left subclavin during
flouro for PICC. This was c/b low plt ? HIT. THis returned neg
and was started lovenox as a bridge to coumadin.


Past Medical History:
-Squamous cell cancer of the vallecula that was diagnosed in
[**2181**]
(T2N0M0). He was initially treated with radiation. Pt later
presented with dysphagia and CT of his neck revealed that he had

a 2.8 x2.1 x 4.5 cm right tonisillar mass, unresectable tonsil
cancer, which could be palliated with systemic chemotherapy
and/or XRT or a combination of both. XRT and chemo (Taxol/CDDP)

initiated in [**1-28**].
-Alcoholic cirrhosis
-Seizure d/o - last sz > 2y ago
-Psoriasis
-G tube placed [**10-27**] [**1-23**] failure of swallow test
-Pancreatitis secondary to ETOH
-Hepatic encephalopathy
-Bleeding esophageal varices
-Portal vein thrombosis


Social History:
Lives with his wife, although he has been in [**Name (NI) **] [**Hospital1 1501**] and
more recently in acute rehab at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for the past [**1-24**]
months.  Former ETOH. Former smoking.


Family History:
Brother died of CAD at age 34.


Physical Exam:
Vitals: 99.3, 80, 135/75, 18, 93% on 6L trach mask, increased to
97% s/p suctioning and placement on 35% O2 via trach mask.
General: 50M in NAD, appears older than stated age
HEENT: NC/AT. PERRLA. EOMI. MMM.
Neck: Trach collar in place with beige secretions.
CV: Normal S1, S2 without m/r/g.
Pulm: coarse breath sounds B/L, otw CTAB.
Abd: Soft, NT/ND with normoactive BS. PEG tube in place, c/d/i.

Ext: no c/c/e. psoriasis on B/L UE and LE.
Neuro: pt not talking, but nodding head appropriately.


Pertinent Results:
Head CT without contrast: There is no intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures,
or hydrocephalus. There is no major or minor vascular
territorial infarction. The differentiation of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter is preserved. Density values of brain parenchyma are
within normal limits. The surrounding soft tissues and osseous
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage. No change compared to [**2184-7-22**]

Portable AP chest dated [**2189-3-30**] is compared to the prior PA and
lateral from [**2189-3-9**]. Tracheostomy tube is seen terminating in
the mid trachea, good and stable position. A right PICC line
terminates in the mid axillary line. The heart size is normal.
The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The hilar contours are
stable. The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax
IMPRESSION: No evidence for infiltrate.


Brief Hospital Course:
50 y/o male with a h/o squamous cell cancer of vallecula s/p
XRT and tonsillar cancer s/p recent chemo/XRT and recent
klebsiella pna admitted with recurrent lethargy and increased
sputum:
.
# Lethargy and increased sputum: likely [**1-23**] recurrent
tracheo-bronchitis, treated with antibiotics initially given
poor baseline. Resp therapist noted that trach plug smelled like
pseudomonas. Pt has been in rehabs/hospitals for last several
months and has been exposed to many drug-resistant organisms.
However, positive cultures (MRSA, ESBL Klebsiella) may represent
colonization rather than true infection. Abx stopped on [**4-4**] and
clinically well-appearing, with no fevers.
-WBC continues to be low, possibly from meropenem; trending up
off [**Last Name (un) 2830**] and received dose of neupogen yesterday
-trach changed [**4-1**], still with thick secretions but strong
cough
-continue airway humidification as much as possible to help
break up secretions
-pt should NOT have his trach downsized in the near future, even
at rehab due to problems with secretions accumulating and
infections
-PICC changed and replaced (see below)
.
# Hypotension: likely from dehydration given that wife reports
tube feeds and IVF have been held x 4 days. Pt responded quickly
to 1L NS and now is normotensive. Initially gave D5NS at 75 per
hour until TF restarted. (family gives history of extensive LE
edema which is now not present but do not wish to overload with
fluids).
-continues to be normotensive, no further IVF needed for now
-should have airway humidification as much as possible to avoid
dehydration through trach
.
# left subclavian vein DVT: detected under fluoro for PICC
placement; not started on heparin overnight due to concern for
HIT; however, on discussion with heme/onc, pt previously worked
up for HIT and has intermittent thrombocytopenia
- bridge to coumadin with lovenox (coumadin started [**4-3**])
.
# Elevated Cr: only slightly elevated to 1.2 (baseline 0.7) on
admission. Likely from dehydration. Creat down with hydration.
.
# Onc: 2 primary head and neck cancers.
-plan per oncology team
.
# Psoriasis - cont on clobetasol cream.
.
# Cirrhosis - cont lactulose and nadolol. LFT's at baseline.
.
# Seizure disorder - cont Keppra and Dilantin. Dilantin level
15.9 in ED. (therapeutic is [**10-10**]). Check Dilantin level as may
be interfering with WBC.
.
# FEN - tube feeds, will change to bolus. Cont reglan and use
ativan and compazine prn nausea.
.
# Access: has PICC (needs TPA) and peripherals.
.
# Code: Full, discussed with patient
