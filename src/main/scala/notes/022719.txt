Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2840**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath
pna, asthma exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:

 52 y/o F with hx of asthma, sinusitis and hx of CVA presented
with three day history of shortness of breath on [**12-11**]. The
shortness of breath was progressive and felt like she just
couldn't catch her breath. She did endorse some wheeziness.
Patient denied fevers, chills, night sweats. She did not have a
cough. She had been struggling with a year of sinus pain and
pressure and trouble breathing through her nose.
.
In the ED, vitals were 99.6, 101 axillary, 130, 135/68, 95% on
neb. CXR showed bilateral upper lobe infiltrates concerning for
pneumonia vs. bronchitis. Patient was thought to be at least
somewhat immune compromised due to hx of steroid use per ENT
treatment of sinusitis. Patient was admitted directly to MICU
Green.
.
During her hospitalization, she was initially treated for CAP
with clinda and levo. Also initally recieved methylprednisone
for diffuse wheezing. Her abx were then broadened to levo and
ceftriaxone. While in the ICU, patient had bronchoscopy which
showed a 40% eosinophilia (she also had serum eosinophilia). She
had no risk factors for TB and AFB x1 was negative. PCP smear
was negative and LDH was normal. Due to eosinophilia, it was
thought that patient may have Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**]. ANCA was sent, but
negative (although approx 50% of cases ar ANCA neg). All culture
data came back negative so all antibiotics were stopped on
[**12-13**]. Of note, patient had been on IV solumedrol since
admission, with plan to start taper of steroids to PO once
transferred to the floor.
.
On admission to the floor, the patient is feeling better than
she has. Still feels very congested in her sinuses and does not
think the O2 is helping through the NC because she can't breath
through her nose. Has dry mouth and is thirsty. Breathing has
improving, is still mildly dyspneic, but better. She is having a
hard time sleeping and seeing some bright colors and shapes when
she closes her eyes. These symptoms started when she was started
on steroids. Denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, but is
contipated and hasn't had a BM since being in the hospital.

Imaging:
CXR on admission:
There is stable mild biapical pleural thickening. There is mild
peribronchial thickening, unchanged since the prior examination.
There is no focal pulmonary consolidation. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unremarkable.
CONCLUSION:
1. Mild peribronchial thickening may indicate reactive airway
disease/bronchitis.
2. Stable minimal biapical pleural scarring.
.
CTA chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study due to respiratory motion. No central or large
segmental
pulmonary embolism. No dissection.
2. Right upper lobe and left upper lobe pneumonia.
.
Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are myxomatous. The mitral valve leaflets are
elongated. There is mild mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR on discharge:
A region of consolidation in the suprahilar right upper lobe is
shrinking,
perihilar consolidation on the left is not. Followup advised for
presumed
pneumonia, alternatively pulmonary hemorrhage. Lower lungs
clear. Heart size normal. No pleural effusion or evidence of
central adenopathy.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 y/o F with hx of asthma and chronic pansinusitis who presents
with three day history of shortness of breath.  Treated for
pneumonia, but all cultures negative.  Bronchoscopy showed
eosinophilia predominance.  Most likley diagnosis is ANCA (-)
Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**].
.
# Churg [**Doctor Last Name 3532**] - based on esoinophils seen in bronchoscopy and
negative cultures, is the most likely diagnosis.  Did have
history of severe sinusitis and questionable asthma.  Biopsy
from bronchoscopy was still pending at the time of discharge.
With upper lobe opacities and recent steroids could be an rare
infectious process like fungal or aspergillosis or silicosis,
but based on all the negative smears and cultures, makes it less
likely.  Abx were stopped after three days, was monitored for
fevers, and remained afebrile and stable.  Was initially treated
with IV steroids which were transitioned to orals while on the
floor.  She was sent out on a long 6+ week taper, which will be
followed by her pulmonologist.  She was started on bactrim for
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].  She will also need careful monitoring of her blood
sugars while on steroids.  Her PCP was called and we discussed
outpatient plan before she was discharged.  Evenutally will need
PFTs and pulmonary follow up as an outpatient.
