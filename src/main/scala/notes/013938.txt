History of Present Illness:
57 y/o M w/ h/o bilateral frontal hemmorrage following traumatic
injury [**8-8**], who presents from outside hospital with ? expanding
subdural hematoma. He initially presented to OSH on [**2115-10-7**] with
pleuritic chest pain that came on acutely that morning. He
reported sharp right lower chest pain, [**9-12**] in severity
associated with dyspnea. Denied associated productive cough,
fever, chills, nausea, vomiting. No recent long travel, trauma
or history of clots. Presented to [**Hospital1 1474**] where he was found to
have bilateral segmental PE by contrast chest CT. He was
subsequently anticoagulated with lovenox, aspirin, coumadin. He
recieved 2 total doses of lovenox, with most recent dose of 60mg
at 6am the morning of transfer. Subsequently head CT was
performed which showed evidence of acute on chronic subdural
hematoma. He had no complaints of headache, nausea/vomiting,
vision changes, numbness or increased left sided weakness.
Further anti-coagulation was held and plans were made for
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].

Last seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] [**2115-10-2**]. At that time, CT scan of the
head showed interval increase in size of the right frontal
subdural hypodense collection which measures 8 mm thick at its
greatest width, consistent with a chronic subdural hematoma. No
midline shift. There was resolution of blood within the left
inferior frontal contusion.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], admitted to ICU, complains of R sided chest
pain with deep breaths. No other complaints at that time.

[**2115-10-10**] Head CT
Today's examination is compared with the prior from [**2115-10-9**].

There has been continued evolution of the subdural hematoma at
the right frontal convexity. The overall volume of the hematoma
appears to have slightly increased when measured from the inner
table. On today's examination, this measures 1.2 cm from the
inner table whereas previously it had only measured 1 cm.
However, there is no evidence of midline shift. There is mild
mass effect upon the underlying frontal lobe and upon the
ipsilateral frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.

As before, there is hypodensity within the right inferior
frontal lobe consistent with contusion. There is no evidence of
a new hemorrhage. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus. The sinuses
are clear.

IMPRESSION: Slight increase in the size of the right frontal
convexity subdural hematoma. Continued evolution of the
contained blood products.

There is no evidence of a new hemorrhage.

[**2115-10-10**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1093**]:
There has been no interval change in the appearance of the
cervical spine from the prior examination. The alignment of the
cervical vertebral bodies is normal. Normal signal is
demonstrated within the marrow. The spinal cord and
cervicomedullary junction demonstrate normal signal. No
paraspinal signal abnormality is demonstrated.
At C3-4, mild left neural foraminal narrowing is due to a small
left posterior osteophyte.
At C4-C5, no disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or neural
foraminal stenosis is present.
At C5-C6, prominent bilateral foraminal narrowing is secondary
to uncovertebral degenerative changes.
At C6-C7, there is mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing
secondary to uncovertebral spurring. No disc herniation or
spinal stenosis is present.
IMPRESSION: No change in the appearance of the cervical spine
from [**2115-8-3**].

[**10-9**] head CT: The right subdural hematoma has moderately
increased in size and has a new acute hemorrhage.  The extension
of this hematoma cranially toward vertex is now more evident.
There is mild local mass effect, however, there is no shift of
midline structures.  The contusion on the left frontal orbital
area is stable.  There are no other areas of intracranial
hemorrhage.  Density values of remainder of the brain parenchyma
is normal.  Differentiation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter is
preserved.  The ventricles are normal, without hydrocephalus.
The basal cisterns are patent.  The visualized paranasal and
mastoid air cells are clear.

[**10-10**] HEAD CT: IMPRESSION: Slight increase in the size of the
right frontal convexity subdural hematoma. Continued evolution
of the contained blood products.

[**10-11**] Head CT: stable subdurals
.
[**10-14**] Head CT: stable subdurals
.
[**10-16**] Head CT: subdural 16mm max diameter (increased from 14mm)
w/ signs of increased intensity around rim. ?rebleed vs nl
changes of acute bleed to chronic subdurl?
.
EKG:
.
CTA chest:  filling defect at the bifurcation of the segmental
left lower lobe pulmonary artery.  This corresponds to the
patient's known pulmonary embolism diagnosed at an outside
hospital a few days earlier. There is dense consolidation in the
superior, lateral and posterior segments of the right and left
lower lobes.  Additionally, within the right lower lobe, there
is an approximately 1.5-cm area of cavitation in the posterior
segment of the right lower lobe.  There are overlying
moderate-sized pleural effusions bilaterally

Head CT [**10-19**] stable


Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo M s/p traumatic head injury in [**8-8**] with bifrontal
hemmorhage who was transferred from OSH on [**10-9**] with chest pain
and dyspnea. At OSH he would found to have bilateral PE's via
CTA. He had been recently lying in bed most of the day [**3-7**] his
recent trauma. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further mgmt
where he was admitted to the MICU service overnight. While in
the MICU, heaprin gtt intially started but then a head CT showed
an increased size in the hematoma. He was unchanged
neurologically but risks outweighed benefits of anticoagulation
therefore it was decided to persue a removable [**Hospital1 **] filter. This
was placed on [**10-10**] with improvement in chest pain and other sxs.
His pain was controlled with morphine prn. He was called out of
the MICU to the neurosurgical service on [**10-10**].
.
On [**10-11**] he c/o worsening chest pain and SOB with sats notable for
92% on RA which improved with supplimental oxygen. His EKG
remained unchanged. He stated he felt more dyspnic with minimal
activity including moving from stretch to bed which was new for
him. He developed a temp to 101 and a leukocytosis to 15 (from
10). He had such severe pleuritic pain that he was taking very
shallow breaths and was tachypnic near 35 RR.
.
CXR showed RLL collapse with dense consolidation and moderate B
pleural effusions. CTA che
