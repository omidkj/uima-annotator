DIAGNOSIS:



Left ventricle aneurysm:

Myocardial tissue with marked fibrosis and focal chronic
inflammation; organizing thrombus.







Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent preoperative workup.  He
was found to have gout in right 1 st digit and uric acid level
9.7, that was treated effectively with colchicine. He had a swan
ganz catheter placed preoperatively to evaluate filling
pressures which required intensive care admission.  The next day
he was brought to the operating room adn underwent coronary
artery bypass graft surgery, Mitral valve repair, and left
ventricular aneurysm resection.  See operative report for
further details.  He received vancomycin for perioperative
antibiotics. He was transferred to the intensive care unit for
hemodynamic monitoring.  In the first twenty four hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was
extubated without complications.  He was required inotropic
medications that were weaned off, and remained in intensive care
on phenylephrine for hypotension which was weaned off.  He was
started on carvedilol and captopril for acute on chronic
systolic heart failure, start lasix for diuresis, and was
transferred post operative day two to the floor for the
remainder of his care.  On post operative day three he was
transfused with one unit packed red blood cells for decreased
hematocrit.  His anemia remained stable and he was ready for
discharge home with services on post operative day five.  Follow
up for coumadin, VNA to draw lab [**1-31**], with results to [**Hospital1 **]
coumadin clinic for further dosing.
