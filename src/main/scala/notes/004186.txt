FINDINGS:

The heart size is top normal and unchanged.  The mediastinal and
hilar
contours are stable and within normal limits.  The pulmonary
vascularity is
not engorged.  A trace left pleural effusion is likely present.
There is
minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present, and
no acute
osseous abnormalities seen.

IMPRESSION:

Small left pleural effusion and mild bibasilar atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 63F C1D6 following Taxotere/Cyclophosphamide, reent
MICU admission for diverticulitis, on cipro/flagyl, now presents
with rigors in PCP office, soft blood pressures and neutropenia.

# Neutropenia/Abdominal pain/Hypotension: The patient was
recently discharged from the MIcu after hospital stay for
diverticulitis and continued on ciprofloxacin/metronidazole. She
presented to her PCP  pancytopenic following chemotherapy (ANC
243). Given she was previously diagnosed with diverticulitis
during the past admission, the initial concern for bacteremia
vs. colitis with comlicatons such as abscess vs. other
infection. Abdominal exam was benign, patent's GI symptoms have
not worsened. CXR benign, no history of dysuria.

She was resuscitated with 2L IVF and responded adequately with
pressures going from 80s-90s systolic to 110s systolic.  A
repeat CBC shows uptrending WBC at 5.8 with 36% neutrophils, no
longer neutropenic.  Her vitals were closely monitored and
serial abdominal exams were performed.  She was afebrile and
never met SIRS criteria and her belly was soft and nontender
during the entire admission.

I spoke extensively with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the atrius attending
covering heme/onc today, and he agreed with my assessment that
the patient likely is not acutely infected and is not at
increased risk for infection as her WBC recovered.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 849**],
her PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] and her case was discussed.  She agreed to
see the patient in her clinic the following day for close
monitoring.

# Headache: Her headache symptoms were minimal during this
hospital
