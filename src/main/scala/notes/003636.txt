Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea, respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old male with
long tobacco use history, known coronary artery disease,
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post
myocardial infarction in [**2170**], and restenosis in [**2172**], now
transferred from [**Hospital6 2910**] for cardiac
catheterization.

Patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], presented to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] earlier this month
with a complaint of increased dyspnea and stress test showed
severe reversible inferior ischemia.  The patient was taken
to cardiac catheterization on [**2175-4-11**] at [**Hospital6 1322**] which showed RA pressure of 6, PA pressure of 46/20,
LV pressure of 112/26, RV pressure of 46/6, and pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 14.  Patient had a cardiac index
of 2.05, and a SVR of 1494.  He was also shown to have
moderate luminal irregularities in the mid RCA.  There was
99% stenosis of the prior stent in the RCA distally.  The
left circumflex artery was patent, as was the left main and
the left anterior descending artery.  Ejection fraction of
30-40% with global hypokinesis, no MR, there was a question
of a 60% stenosis of the external iliac.

Status post catheterization, patient went into hypoxic
respiratory failure.  He was suctioned without improvement,
and was transferred to [**Hospital6 2910**] MICU,
where he was intubated.  He was thought to be in congestive
heart failure and was diuresed and extubated on [**2175-4-12**].  He
was also given steroids for presumed chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation.  Postintubation, the patient
again became dyspneic and tachypneic, and had to be
reintubated.

There is a question of a right lower lobe infiltrate.  The
patient was bronched with mucus plug aspirate from the right
lower lobe and left lower lobe.  Of note, the patient's
systolic blood pressure at [**Hospital6 2910**]
decreased into the 70s to 80s when he was sedated.  Nutrition
evaluation revealed moderate malnutrition.

Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for PTCA and brachytherapy of instent restenosis.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2175-4-14**] at [**Hospital1 190**] revealed 99% right coronary artery lesion,
successfully PTCA with brachytherapy.  His pressures were RA
43/13, RV 45/14, PA 44/27, pulmonary capillary wedge was 20,
and aortic outflow was 118/76.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 60-year-old male with
history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
coronary artery disease, who presents with instent
restenosis, status post PTCA and brachytherapy with
respiratory failure.

1. Coronary artery disease:  After his catheterization
in-house, the patient did not complain of any kind of chest
pain or discomfort.  He was placed on a good cardiac regimen.
He was continued on aspirin, started on Plavix.  He was also
continued on Lopressor 25 mg po bid.  Patient's lisinopril
dose was titrated up to 10 mg po q day as his pressure
tolerated.  Patient did not receive Integrilin
postcatheterization as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

2. Pump:  Patient's echocardiogram from [**4-14**] shows an
ejection fraction of 30% with inferior akinesis and a
hypokinetic RV.  During the patient's hospitalization, he did
have an episode of hypoxia, and it was thought that there was
a contribution from failure.  His regular Lasix dose was not
sufficing.  Patient received 40 of IV Lasix which led to good
diuresis, but the patient was quite sensitive in terms of his
blood pressure.  Otherwise, the patient's lisinopril dose was
able to be titrated up to 10 mg po q day over several days as
his hemodynamics improved.

3. Blood pressure:  The patient had an episode of
hypertension while on the vent, going down to 75/48.  This
was thought to be secondary to Lasix.

4. Rhythm:  Patient did not have any arrhythmias while
in-house.

5. Pulmonary:  Patient was overall difficult to wean, which
extended his hospital stay.  This was thought to be due to a
combination of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
developing pneumonia in his lower lung bases.  The Pulmonary
team was consulted.  Patient was initially on AC mode
ventilation.  While he tolerated this, he was quite easily
able to transition to pressure support mode, and it was not
felt that the patient was tiring out.  However, at one point,
the patient may have received too much in terms of narcotics,
which elevated his pCO2.  This is still unclear as the
patient has a very high narcotic threshold.  While in-house,
the patient received bronchoscopy.  This revealed clean
bronchial tree.  There was very little that was suctioned
out.  Once the infection was under control with the proper
antibiotics, we were able to lower his PEEP enough that he
could be extubated.  Patient was extubated on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**4-21**].  Overall, his chest x-ray was consistent with bilateral
atelectasis versus pneumonia, with varying degrees of
pulmonary edema.

Once the patient was extubated, he was placed on 6 liters of
O2 through his trache stoma, and 12 liters of shovel mask as
needed.  Given his pulmonary improvement, the patient did not
need any revision of his trache stoma as it had originally
been thought during his stay here.

Patient's gas from [**4-22**] after he was extubated was 7.42, 51,
50.  We believe that the patient generally has a very low
pAO2 baseline around 45-50.  We have been targeting his O2
saturation to high 80's to low 90's.  Patient was also
weaned off of his steroids as he was not really thought to be
in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
Patient is currently on 5 mg of prednisone.  That will be
continued for one week, through [**2175-4-30**].
