Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8388**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, vomiting, falls, abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGd, Intubation

History of Present Illness:
(obtained from records):  61 y/o M with hx of CVA, hep C
cirrhosis, GIB, was reportedly found slightly altered and
covered in vomit at home, by his sister. She reported concern
that he had not been taking his medications. The patient
reportedly told her that he had had several falls earlier in the
day. He was assisted to the bathroom, but fell there with a head
strike but no LOC. He subsequently had an acute change in his
mental status, manifested by confusion and repetitive
questioning. His baseline mental status is reportedly normal; he
was last seen at this baseline this past Wednesday.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were 97.5, 161/104, 120, 18, 98% 4L
NC. Exam was notable for soft abdomen, reactive pupils, and
melenotic, guaiac positive stool. He was reportedly A+Ox1. He
vomited once, with bilious, non-bloody emesis, no coffee
grounds. Labs revealed elevated anion gap with lactate of 9. Hct
was 32 and WBC count was 18 with left shift. Lactate trended
down with IVF and fluids. LFTs were generally normal, with DBili
1.8. BUN was mildly elevated but creatinine was normal.
.
He had a negative FAST survey. He was given lorazepam 1 mg,
lactulose 30 mg, pantoprazole 40 mg IV, rifaximin 550 mg,
levaquin 750 IV, metronidazole 500 mg IV, cefepime 2g, and an
unspecified amount of IVF. Hepatology was consulted, and felt
that the patient is having an episode of hepatic encephalopathy,
triggered by a UTI. They recommended treating encephalopathy
with lactulose and rifaximin, as well as treatment of his
presumed UTI. It was felt that the patient had too little
ascites to tap. Hepatology also recommended monitoring hct and
performing emergent endoscopy if becomes unstable, in the
setting of known varices.

EKG:  Sinus tachycardia @ 117 bpm. Leftward axis. Normal
intervals. Atypical R wave progression suggests suboptimal lead
placement. +TWF in V1.
.
Imaging:
-CXR: Low inspiratory lung volumes. No acute cardiopulmonary
abnormality otherwise identified.
-CT C-spine (prelim): 1. no fx or malalignment
2. prominent posterior osteophytes @ C3-C4 with neural foramina
narrowing and moderate spinal canal narrowing, placing pt @
increased risk for cord injury - if clinical concern for such
exists, MR would be recommended
-CT head (prelim): 1. no ich. 2. old L PCA infarct
-CT abd/pelvis (prelim): 1. cirrhotic liver w/ gastroesophageal
varices, patent umbilical vein, and perihepatic/splenic ascites
2. no colitis, obstruction, or abscess

EGD --> nonbleeding varices (grade I- III), 3 duodenal ulcers
with one visible vessel in the ulcer.  Cauterized the biggest
ulcer and injected epinephrine into the visible vessel

Ultrasound-guided paracentesis: IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated
paracentesis with removal of 1.1 liters of fluid.

MRI HEAD without contrast - IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute hemorrhage, acute infarct, or mass
effect.
2. Extensive FLAIR/T2 hyperintensity within the cerebral white
matter. This most likely represents advanced microvascular
disease. Sparing of the central [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter makes metabolic
processes less likely.
3. Large, chronic left PCA infarct, similar to prior. Other
details as above.

RUQ Ultrasound - Limited imaging of four quadrants was performed
to evaluate for ascites.  There is a small amount of free fluid
seen in the right upper quadrant, without significant fluid seen
in the remaining quadrants.

EEG - Results pending.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Altered mental status: Likely chronic advanced microvascular
disease as demonstrated on MRI with superimposed hepatic
encephalopathy due to acute GI bleed.  Patient was treated with
lactulose and rifaximin and his asterixis resolved.  His mental
status however, has not returned to his baseline, likely due to
microvasculature insults to his brain.  Final EEG results
pending at time of discharge although suspicion for seizure
activity overall is low.  Seroquel, opiates, benzodiazepines and
his home trazodone were held/avoided to prevent further
confusion.

# Abdominal discomfort:  He was initially treated with
ceftriaxone 1g daily for SBP prophylaxis, but due to persistent
abdominal discomfort, he received a diagnostic paracentesis on
[**2162-2-25**].  Peritoneal fluid cultures were negative, but he was
empirically treated with ceftriaxone 2g daily for 8 days due to
high suspicion for SBP and potentially negative cultures while
on prophylactic antibiotic dosing.  RUQ ultrasound [**2162-3-3**]
revealed a small amount of ascites and with mildly increased LE
edema, his diuretics were increased to furosemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **] and
spironolactone 100mg daily.  These diuretics can be increased
should his weight continue to increase at the skilled nursing
facility.

# Upper GIB: Patient presented with melena and had known
varices. Hct was initially stable but in setting of NGT
placement he was noted to
