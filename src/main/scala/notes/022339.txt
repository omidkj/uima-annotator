Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted after cardiac catheterization and underwent
preoperative workup.  Next day was brought to the operating room
for aortic valve replacement.  See operative report for further
details.  She received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics.
 Post operatively she was transferred to the intensive care unit
for management.  In the first twenty four hours she was weaned
from sedation, awoke and was extubated without complications.
On post operative day two she was transferred to the floor.

was started on anticoagulation for her mechanical aortic valve
and atrial fibrillation.  She continued to do well and was ready
for discharge home with services on post operative day six.
