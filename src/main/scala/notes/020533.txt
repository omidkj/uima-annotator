Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation.

History of Present Illness:
82 F with PMH CAD, DVT, CHF(recently hospitalized [**11-28**] for CHF
exacerbation) presented to ED this am with chest pain and SOB
that developed while walking to radiolgy for outpatient
ultrasound of her liver ordered by PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was seen in PCP's
office [**12-12**] for follow up of recent CHF exacerbation and found
to have SBP 140/70 and clear lung exam.  Today per husband pt
was walking and complained of sudden onset, sharp chest
tightness lasting minutes associated with SOB which resolved
with oxygen. Per husband, she has not had any recent fevers,
chills, cough or symptoms. Normal appetite and slept well last
night.
.
On arrival to ED, VS HR 82 BP 62/54 RR 20 O2 86% on 2 L nasal
canula. Pt given 2 L IVF with minimal improvement in SBP 70s and
shortly developed increasing respiratory distress. Per ED notes,
she was intubated for hypoxic respiratory distress. Resident who
intubated pt reports normal intubation without evidence of
aspiration. Pt started on Dopamine without improvement in SBP,
so Levophed added as well.
.
ED concerned for PE with acute onset SOB, hypotension, and h/o
DVT. Discussion of lytics, but pt sent for CTA which did not
show PE. CTA showed B/L pleural effusions/ consolidations/ ? air
bronchograms.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is an 82yo F with recent admission for flash
pulmonary edema admitted for acute onset of chest pain and
shortness of breath requiring intubation.  The pt was found to
have CHF likely due to transient ischemia in the setting of
diastolic heart dysfunction.
.
#. [**Name (NI) 4964**] unclear etiology.  The pt was found to go into afib with
RVR while in the MICU, but this was likely stress induced (pt in
NSR on admission).  Perhaps pt had brief episode of ischemia
leading to decreased LV complaince and worsening of her
diastolic dysfunction.  The pts  TTE on [**12-15**] was c/w with some
diastolic dysfunction.  She ruled out for MI with 3 sets of
negative cardiac enzymes.  The pt was diuresed while in the
MICU.  The pt was restarted on metoprolol and verapamil to
increase her LV filling time.  Her metoprolol was titrated up to
37.5 mg po bid and she was discharged on Toprol XL 75 mg po qd.
The pt was discharged on verapamil 80 mg po bid.  She will need
an outpt stress test.  Once on the floor, the pt was satting at
92%RA while walking.  She did not require diuresis.  The pt was
not started on ACE-inhibitor as we will defer to her outpt
cardiologist to start this (per OMR notes, it seems pt had been
on ACE in the past and it was stopped for some reason).
.
#. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The pts initial presentation
(CP, SOB, hypoxia, hypotension) was extremely concerning for PE
and the patient was started on heparin drip but CTA was negative
for clot. The pt was extubated on [**12-15**].  Cxr initially thought
to be [**3-15**] aspiration but the pts clinical status had rapid
resolution w/ diuresis.  PNA felt to be unlikely as pt had no
fever/cough. It is felt the pt likely had transient ischemia
leading to hypoxia/flash pulm edema. The pt r/o for MI with 3
sets of cardiac enzymes.  The pt was often wheezing on exam, and
her SOB near time of discharge seemed out of proportion to her
lung exam.  Consideration may be given to outpatient PFTs.
.
#  Episode of Atrial Fibrillation--While the pt was in the MICU
she had an episode of Afib with RVR (HR 120s).  Given EKG on
admission was NSR and the A fib was noted the following day, her
Afib was likely stress induced (from LV/LA volume overload in
setting of stiff LV).  Per OMR notes, the pt has been followed
for an irregular heart rhythm in the past, and there has been
concern for anticoagulation given fall risk.  The pt remained in
NSR for the rest of her stay, and she was not started on
anticoagulation.  Her need for anticoagulation can be further
evaluated on an outpt basis.
.
#. Hypotension: The pt was hypotensive on arrival even after 2L
IVF, then requiring 2 pressors in ED. This was initially
concerning for sepsis although afebrile and lactate 1.4. Likely
cardiogenic, although no signs of massive PE or MI; perhaps had
ischemia which transiently worsened baseline diastolic
dysfunction. Pts BP was stable at discharge.
.
#. Hypothyroid: Continued levothyroxine
.
# Drop in hematocrit: Pt had Hct drop from 43 on admission [**12-14**],
to 32 on [**12-16**].  The pt was guaiac negative.  There was no clear
source of bleed. The pts hct was up to 35 prior to discharge.
It is possible the one lab value on [**12-16**] was spurious
.
#CAD:  The pt has a ? h/o CAD.  She was maintained on aspirin,
metoprolol.  The pt was not initially on a statin, so her
cholesterol levels were ordered for risk stratification.  She
was found to have an LDL of 127 on [**12-15**].  The pt was started on
low dose atorvastatin 20 mg po qd.  The pt was also not on an
ACE inhibitor on admission, but again, we will defer to her
outpt cardiologist to start this medication (OMR notes are
unclear if pt was on an ACE inhibitor before and it was stopped
for some reason).  Given the pts likely episode of transient
ischemia inducing her flash pulmonary edema, stress test would
be warranted in the near future.
.
#  Episode of Atrial Fibrillation--Unclear if CHF exacerbation
induced atrial stretch/afib or if afib led to CHF exacerbation.
Given EKG on admission NSR and A fib noted the following day,
Afib likely stress induced.  Concern for anticoagulation given
fall risk
--will discuss with outpt cardiologist re anticoagulation
.
#Dispo: The pt was discharged with home PT and a walker.  She
may need outpt PFTs and stress test.
