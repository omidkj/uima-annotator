Hypoglycemia

None

History of Present Illness:
72F history of sleep apnea on CPAP, A. fib on Coumadin, COPD (1L
O2 NC at home), diabetes on insulin, CHF presents with
hypoglycemic episode after being discharged from hospital
yesterday [**6-5**] after a MICU admission for hypercarbic
respiratory failure. This AM, she took both her Lantus 60U and
10U of regular insulin for an AM FSG of 259, but did not eat
anything b/c she was in a hurry to get to her PCP's appt. About
2 hrs after taking her insulin, she was found walking around and
confused (per the daughter, however, the pt was found down in
the hallway by a neighbor). EMS was called by her husband and
she was found to have a fingerstick glucose of 21. She was given
an amp of D50, after which her mental status improved, and her
repeat blood glucose was in the 200s. She denies any recent
fevers or chills; she was recently hospitalized for hypercarbic
respiratory failure thought to be secondary to a COPD
exacerbation, and she was intubated from [**5-29**]- [**2198-5-30**]. She was
initially on ABx but they were d/c'd during hospitalization. No
cough. No SOB per patient. No Abd pain/N/V/D/changes in bowel or
bladder habits, no dysuria.

In the ED, initial VS were:  96.2 89 134/46 20 96%. She was
lethargic, but arousable, A+O x1. She had a FSBG of 71 and was
given repeat D50, 290 on repeat. Repeat at 1455 was 22. She was
given another amp of D50, and was started on a D5 drip. Pt was
hypercarbic on ABG even when sitting up and talking. On 1L O2 NC
92-94%.

On arrival to the MICU, the pt is comfortable and has no
complaints. ROS negative. Pt remarked that she has never had a
problem with hypoglycaemia in the past.

[**6-7**] EKG:
Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response. Left
axis
deviation. Left anterior fascicular block. There is a late
transition with
small R waves in the anterior leads consistent with possible
infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing

atrial fibrillation is new.

IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small
bilateral pleural
effusions.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
ACTIVE ISSUES:

## Hypoglycemia: Most likely due to taking home dose of Lantus
60U in setting of lack of oral intake on the day of admission
and mild renal failure with associated decreased insulin
clearance. There was no sign of infectious etiology. TSH and AM
Cortisol were normal. She was started on a D10 drip in the ICU
until fingersticks stabilized. Despite excellent oral intake on
the floor, her Insulin requirements initially remained
relatively minimal compared to her home dose. [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted and recommended a lower dose of basal insulin at [3
uptitrated to 8 units on the day of discharge [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]
recommendations, received 5units QHS [**6-11**]]. They also
recommended that a DDPV-4 inhibitor that does not require renal
clearance and  recommended linagliptin 5mg daily to start upon
discharge. She should follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] upon discharge from
rehab facility. Would check finger sticks QIDACHS at this time.


## Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled and in sinus rhythm. Her
INR was elevated on admission 3.2 and then increased to 4.6. Her
Warfarin 6mg was held until the INR trended down and was
restarted at 5mg on [**6-10**]. Given that pt was supratherapeutic
today [**6-12**]. Her dose should be held on [**6-12**] and restarted at 3mg
warfarin daily when INR is <3 (possibly on [**6-13**]) with close INR
monitoring. Her BB was continued at the equivalent home dose.
She was discharged on her home dose.
.
## Sleep apnea on CPAP: CPAP was continued at night during
admission. Patient and her family spoke of the need for a new
machine as the current machine is not operating correctly.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

## COPD (2L O2 NC at home): Continued home nebs, maintained on
supplemental O2 for goal saturation 88-90% Pt is on 1L o2 at
home.

## Primary respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic
alkalosis: Likely chronic in setting of her COPD. Respiratory
status appeared stable.

## Chronic diastolic CHF: No active issues during this
admission. Home cardiac meds were continued.

## Stage 3 CKD, baseline Cr 1.8: Cr upon admission was 2.1 and
peaked at 2.4, which was thought to be aberrant since it rose
and improved without any intervention. 1.8 on day of DC.

## Anemia: normocytic, chronic. Likely related to CKD and
diabetes. Hct remained stable during admission without any
transfusion requirement. Can conside
