CXR [**11-2**]:
No evidence of pneumonia or CHF. Rounded opacities projecting
over the right hilum may represent vascular structures or
prominent lymph nodes. Lateral chest radiograph is recommended
for further evaluation.

ECHO [**11-4**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low-normal (LVEF= 50 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular dysfunction.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo female with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia and CRI who
presented with hypertensive emergency and pulmonary edema.
.
HYPERTENSION: Pt presented with severe HTN, dypsnea and elevated
JVP.  Neuro exam non-focal.  She appeared to be in volume
overload, and was agressively diuresed with a lasix drip.  She
was weaned off nitroglycerin gtt and her labetalol dose was
increased.  These interventions brought her blood pressure under
better control.  A repeat Echo showed ef of 50% and mild
regional left ventricular dysfunction.

CORONARY ARTERY [**Name (NI) 7653**] Pt was without symptoms of chest pain,
EKG initially concerning for ST elevations/T wave abnl in V1-V3.
Trop 0.06, Ck 132.  She was started on heparin, which was then
stopped in light of negative enzymes.  She was continued on ASA.
 A lipid panel was checked.

Acute on Chronic Renal Failure- baseline appears to be 2.9, and
was elevated to 3.9 on admission.  Cr rose to 5.3 on discharge.
Cr elevation though to be related to poor forward flow
