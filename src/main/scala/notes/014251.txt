Chief Complaint:
work-up of endobronchial mass

Primary Care Physician:
[**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**Name11 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 37134**]
.
Chief Complaint:  transfer from OSH for post obstructive PNA /
eval and management, Metastatic Melanoma. She recently presented
to OSH with c/o SOB, and was treated with oral abx (Avelox) for
PNA. Within 2 days she was readmitted for persistent SOB. She
was found to have afib with RVR, was treated with dilt, and on
her request trasferred to an other OSH (see outside records).
She underwent bronchoscopy, but complicated by post procedure
afib, rvr, and resp distress. She was treated with Zosyn and
levofloxacin for post obstructive pna, given extensive pulmonary
disease on OSH Ct. Course complicated by an episode of dilirium,
and brief rise in creatinine. Per recommendation of primary
oncologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 87663**], radiation to obstructing
endobronchial lesion should be considered, and was therefore
accepted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Currently patient reports no SOB (although in obviouse
respiratory dysstress)

IMAGING:
CXR ([**8-27**]):
FINDINGS: Low lung volumes. Right pectoral pacemaker with
correct lead
position. Moderate right pleural effusion with subsequent right
atelectasis.
Mild cardiomegaly, signs of mild fluid overload. Increased size
of the left
hilus that should be further evaluated by CT. No evidence of
pneumonia.

CXR ([**8-28**]):
Severe cardiomegaly and enlarged main and left pulmonary
arteries are
unchanged. Right transvenous catheter tip is in the standard
position in the
right ventricle. Moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent
atelectasis is
unchanged. Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened. There is no
evident
pneumothorax.
.
CXR ([**8-29**]):
A single lead right chest wall pacemaker is seen with the tip
terminating in the right ventricle. Again seen is severe
cardiomegaly with
enlargement of the pulmonary arteries which are unchanged.
Moderate right and
mild left pleural effusions with adjacent lung atelectasis
remain stable since
the prior radiograph. A small nodular opacity in the left upper
lung on
correlation with chest CT dated [**2191-7-25**] represents lung
nodule and in
view of history is concerning for metastasis. There is no
pneumothorax.
.
CXR ([**8-29**]):
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and hugely dilated main and left
pulmonary
arteries are longstanding. The extent and nature of bibasilar
consolidative
abnormalities are better displayed by the concurrent chest CTA
reported
separately showing left lower lobe atelectasis and a large right
lower lobe
pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also present.
Transvenous
right ventricular pacer lead is in standard placement. No
pneumothorax.
.
ECHO ([**8-30**]):
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal/small. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size appears normal to mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. There is right
