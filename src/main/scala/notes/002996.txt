Pertinent Results:
KUB [**8-12**] 4:30 pm: IMPRESSION: Massively dilated sigmoid colon
gas with a coffee bean appearance in the mid-abdomen, highly
suspicious for sigmoid volvulus.

KUB [**8-12**] 6:20 pm: IMPRESSION: Interval placement of sigmoid tube
with decompression of previously seen sigmoid volvulus.

KUB [**2132-8-13**] 8:10 IMPRESSION: Decompression of previously seen
sigmoid volvulus.

KUB [**2132-8-13**] 4:00 pm  IMPRESSION:
1. Status post removal of the rectal tube, no evidence of
volvulus
recurrence.
2. Interval increase in extent of the right lower lung
opacities, a followup with a dedicated chest radiograph is
recommended.

KUB [**2132-8-14**] 7:22 AM  IMPRESSION: Interval recurrence of sigmoid
colon dilatation, an asymmetric appearance and absence of
dilation of proximal large bowel, may represent pseudovolvulus.

KUB [**2132-8-14**] 5:21 PM  IMPRESSION: Interval placement of rectal
tube into the sigmoid colon with decompression of a previously
seen sigmoid distention.

KUB [**2132-8-16**] 10:07 AM  IMPRESSION: Rectal tube present. No
volvulus identified. No obstruction identified.

KUB [**2132-8-16**] 10:20 PM  The rectal tube has been withdrawn to the
level of the rectum. Air is seen throughout the rectum. No
findings to suggest obstruction. No grossly dilated small bowel
is identified.

KUB [**2132-8-17**] 1:36 PM  FINDINGS: Rectal tube appears to be placed
within the rectosigmoid, which contains air. Bowel loops
proximal to this appear to being decompressed. Bowel wall mucosa
cannot be well described as the bowel is decompressed. If there
is continuing clinical concern for ischemia, CT with intravenous
contrast may be helpful.

KUB [**2132-8-17**] 6:23 PM  The rectal tube has been placed more
proximally within the sigmoid. Again noted is one abnormal
colonic loop with a thumbprinting pattern. This pattern is
nonspecific but can be associated with ischemia. Correlate with
clinical findings. The remainder of the bowel is otherwise
unremarkable. This finding was discussed by the radiology
resident with surgery.

KUB [**2132-8-17**] 8:20 AM  IMPRESSION: No volvulus identified. One of
the colonic air filled loops appears to have a thumb-print
pattern, a findings that can be associated with ischemia.
Findings transmitted to the nurse caring for the patient at the
time of interpretation.

COLON (GASTROGRAF) [**2132-8-19**] 11:02 AM  GASTROGRAFIN ENEMA:
Gastrografin was administered per rectum under constant
fluoroscopic guidance. Although there is a capacious sigmoid
colon, there is no evidence of sigmoid volvulus. Sacttered
sigmoid diverticuli are noted. Contrast passed through to the
cecum without evidence of obstruction. Scout image demonstrates
diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta and
iliac system.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of obstruction or volvulus.
2. Sigmoid diverticulosis.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2132-8-20**]
Conclusions:  The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure(PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admited with abdominal distension and discomfort, with a
sigmoid volvulus seen on KUB. A rectal tube was placed in the ED
to decompress the air-filled sigmoid colon. Serial abdominal
exams showed improvement of tenderness, and the rectal tube was
removed on HD2. Serial KUB's showed resolution of volvulus. The
pt was initially npo and was advanced to clears on HD2. Bedside
swallow eval was performed on HD3 that yielded recommendations
to have a diet of p.o. thin liquids and puree-consistently
solids and 1:1 supervision at mealtimes. On HD3 the pt's diet
was advanced, however the pt became more distended and repeat
KUB demonstrated recurrence of her volvulus. Her volvulus was
again successfully decompressed with rectal tube placement. On
HD5 on transport back from radiology the pt desaturated on room
air and was transferred to the trauma-SICU. EKG and cardiac
enzymes were found to be negative for acute MI. On HD6 she was
started on cipro for a UTI and finished a 3 day course of cipro.
On HD8 her diet was advanced. On HD10 she was started on p.o.
lopressor for hypertension and given instructions to follow up
with her primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of this medication
and of her hypertension. Her foley was also discharged on HD10.
The pt was discharged in stable condition to [**Hospital1 10151**] on HD11.
