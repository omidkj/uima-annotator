Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Pleuritic chest pain, BRBPR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 86 yo woman with h/o CAD s/p angioplasty, COPD,
AFib, colon CA s/p right hemicolectomy, Crohn's disease, who
presents with a 2 day history of bloody stools and new onset
L-sided pleuritic pain.  She states that she was in her normal
state of health until approximately three days ago, when she
began to experience L-sided chest pain.  She describes the pain
as sharp, intermittent, radiating to the back of her neck,
improved with lying down, worse with inspiration.  She states
that she has also had increasing shortness of breath and a
non-productive cough at baseline.  In addition, for the past two
days, she has had dark colored stools mixed with fresh blood.
She denies increasing fatigue, dizziness, syncope.  She also
denies fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.  Of
note, she also endorses increasing LE edema over the past week
and increased DOE (baseline is walking to car).
.
In the ED, VS wre BP 130/65, P 108, R 28, O2 95% on 4L.  She
triggered for an O2 sat of 87% on arrival and her O2 sat
increased to 97% on 4L.  ECG showed AFib with TWIs laterally.
She had a CXR, which showed a pleural effusion and possible
consolidation in right lung.  CTPA showed no PE, pleural
effusion, and cardiomegaly.  She received NTG and Dilt for CHF
exacerbation and was started on Levaquin for possible CAP.  CT
abdomen showed multiple diverticula. GI was consulted, and NG
lavage was negative. Given her respiratory distress and
tachycardia, she was admitted to the MICU for further workup and
evaluation.
.
On the floor, the patient denies current SOB.  She states that
she continues to experience occasional chest pain, which
resolves in [**3-10**] minutes.  She states that she is fatigued but
otherwise has no new complaints.

.
Micro:
U/A: Moderate blood, no leukocytes
.
Images:
CXR ([**9-30**]): There is no evidence of congestive heart failure or
pneumonia. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural
effusion. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated. There is mild left
lower lobe
atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The aorta is
calcified and tortuous. Osseous structures demonstrate
osteopenia and degenerative changes.  There is no definite acute
displaced fracture.
.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis: 1. allowing for respiratory motion, no
large/central/segmental PE seen.  2. cardiomegaly, sm left
pleural effusion, heterogeneous ground glass attenuation of
lungs, most likely due to CHF.  3. colonic diverticulae, without
definite inflammatory change to indicate diverticulitis. no free
air. otherwise study not tailored to assess bowels.  4. small
perihepatic fliud.  5. gallbladder distended with small
calcified gallstones, without ct evidence for wallthickening or
adjacent inflammation.
6. lt adrenal nodule or adjacent node.  7. renal cysts, one
hyperdense.
.
EKG: AFib with rate of 108.  Nl axis.  No ST or T wave
abnormalities.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 86 yo female with h/o CAD, COPD, colon cancer
s/p hemicolectomy, and Crohn's disease, who presents with three
day history of pleuritic chest pain and bloody stools.
.
# GI Bleed:  The patient reportedly had dark stools for two
days.  In the ED, her stools were dark and guiaic positive, and
she had streaks of fresh blood.  Her Hct has remained stable at
40.2.  GI was consulted. Hct remained stable and bleeding was
minimal, with streaks around stools, but no frank BRBPR during
rest of course. GI thought mucosal tear vs. hemorrhoids vs.
diverticulosis was most likely, and that outpatient colonoscopy
was most appropriate. Pt scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy.
.
#. Chest pain:  Pain was pleuritic in nature. CXR and CT
revealed small left sided effusion, likely associated with acute
on chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient was ruled out
for MI. Troponins were negative x3 and ECG didn't demonstrate ST
or TW changes. She was monitored on tele. Chest pain improved
with diuresis.

.
# SOB:  The patient presented with increased SOB, PND, orthopnea
and LE edema consistent with acute diastolic heart failure. The
underlying cause of exacerbation was unclear, as patient had no
signs or symptoms of infection.  She did however eat many salty
foods over the past week. The patient does also have COPD, but
symptoms and exam was more consistent with CHF, and steroids
were held.
BNP was elevated and CT-PA demonstrated fluid overload.  She
initially required O2 with 4 L NC, and improved with diuresis.
TTE showed hyperdynamic LV with LVEF 80%, with moderate
pulmonary HTN. In setting of diastolic dysfuction, digoxin and
Norvasc were stopped and metoprolol was titrated up for maximal
mortality benefit. The patient was diuresed aggressively in the
MICU, and had creatinine bump after 3rd dose of IV Lasix. She
was then diuresed more gently. O2 sat on discharge was 93-95% at
rest and 90 - 92% ambulatory. The patient can follow-up with
cardiologist/PCP about medication management.
.
# LE Edema:  The patient's right leg was significantly larger
than her left leg.  LENI was negative for PE. Edema improved
with diuresis.
.
# A Fib:  The patient has persistent A Fib, and had mild RVR at
presentation.  She received Dilt and NTG in the ED with good
effect. She was better rate controlled after this, and
metoprolol was titrated as needed. She has not been
anticoagulated for many years, and she may discuss this with
outpatient cardiologist/PCP.
.
# CAD:  Continued ASA and Metoprolol.
.
# HTN: Continued Benazepril, Metoprolol, Lasix. D/Ced amlodipine
to allow uptitration of beta-blocker.
