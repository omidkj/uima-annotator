SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with wife.  One pack per day smoker
x60 years, quit two months ago.  Drinks approximately [**7-4**]
drinks per week.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile at 98.7, heart rate 108
irregular, breathing at 36, and blood pressure 124/60, 88
percent on 50 percent Ventimask.  Alert and oriented times
three in no acute distress.  Diffuse coarse breath sounds
with decreased breath sounds in the right upper lobe, no
egophony.  Irregularly, irregular, no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended,

keratoses on shin and along ear with multiple firm blue-black
nodules.  No edema.  Positive for clubbing and cyanosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to General Medicine
with post-obstructive pneumonia, hemoptysis secondary to
endobronchial invasive cancer.  On the floor, the patient
continued to desat and experienced 250 cc of bright red
blood.  Patient was transferred to the MICU and stabilized.

Patient went to bronchoscopy on [**2161-5-27**].  Left trachea
within normal limits.  Two segmental level on the right,
right main stem bronchus approximately 98 percent obstructive
by fungating tumor emanating from the right upper lobe and
tumor was excised and destroyed with microdebrider, 2 APC,
and forceps.  Patent right middle lobe and right lower lobe.
Unable to open right upper lobe.  A 14 x 14 stent was placed.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and continued to be
cared for in the MICU.  Hematocrit remains stable and patient
was weaned down on O2.

The patient was transferred to the General Medicine floor on
[**2161-5-29**], where he underwent Physical Therapy, and was
cleared by Physical Therapy to go home on home O2 with
exertion.  The patient is to continue on seven day course of
antibiotics of levofloxacin and metronidazole as well as
prednisone taper, given prescription for albuterol prn as
well as home O2.

At this time given atrial fibrillation and hemoptysis,
anticoagulation agents were held.  It could be restarted once
hematocrit remains stable.  At time of discharge, hematocrit
35.4.  The patient had defervesced and white count had
returned to [**Location 213**].  No other laboratory values were
abnormal.  At the time of dictation, pathology of excised
tumor is still pending.

In discussion with Interventional Pulmonary, patient was
presented at Tumor Board for possible adjuvant chemotherapy
and resection at a later date.  Patient will be followed up
in Interventional Pulmonary to address these issues.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to followup with PCP in one week
for hematocrit check as well as adjustment of duration of
antibiotic therapy if patient does not defervesce or exhibit
reobstruction pneumonia.

Patient is to be seen by his primary pulmonologist in [**12-26**]
weeks, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 55720**].  At this time, Interventional
Pulmonary does not feel need for high-dosed steroids and will
initiate steroid taper.

Follow up with Dr. [**Name (NI) **] at Interventional
Pulmonology.  Will contact patient in the near future for
further possible intervention and/or chemo/adjuvant therapy.

MAJOR SURGICAL PROCEDURE:  Bronchoscopy with tumor excision
and stent placement of the right main stem bronchus.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to home with
home oxygen services and VNA services.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Albuterol inhaler 1-3 puffs q6 prn.
2. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.d.

4. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d., duration five days.
5. Oxygen to be titrated for saturations 92-95 percent with
   ambulation.
