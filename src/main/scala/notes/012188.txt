Admission Date:  [**2136-5-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2136-5-30**]


Service:  CARDIAC

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Coronary artery disease.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 78-year-old
female who is transferred here from an outside hospital
following an positive exercise treadmill test and positive
catheterization.  She is to be evaluated for coronary artery
bypass graft.  She has had three admissions at [**Hospital **]
Hospital in the past two months for what appears to be
ischemic pulmonary edema.  She now appears to be failing
outpatient medical management.  This included increasing her
beta blockers, increasing Lasix, instituting Aldactone, and
increasing her Norvasc.  The recent echocardiogram was on
[**2136-4-10**], demonstrated apical dyskinesis with an
ejection fraction of 45% to 50%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History is notable for the following:
1.  Coronary artery disease with early cardiomegaly.
2.  Severe arthritis.
3.  Lung cancer status post right lower lobe excision in
[**2126**].
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Non-Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
6.  Decreased hearing.
7.  Chronic low back pain.
8.  Gastritis.
9.  Obesity.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is not allergic to any medicines.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Norvasc 5 mg p.o.q.d.
2.  Lasix 80 mg p.o.q.d.
3.  Lopressor 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o.q.d.
5.  Diovan 80 mg p.o.q.d.
6.  Ecotrin 81 mg p.o.q.d.
7.  Plavix 75 mg p.o.q.d.
8.  Imdur 90 mg p.o.q.d.
9.  Glyburide 2.5 mg p.o.q.a.m.
10. Nystatin powder to the right groin b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not drink alcohol or use
tobacco.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is noted
to be a pleasant female who is hard of hearing, but
otherwise, in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
throat and neck:  she is without JVD.  CHEST:  Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally:  HEART:  Regular rate and
rhythm.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, obese, nontender.  The right groin
catheterization site on arrival had no hematoma and
peripherally the extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis
or edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Cardiac Surgery
Service and appropriate preoperative workup was obtained.
Pulmonary consultation was obtained for this patient's
underlying pulmonary hypertension.  They believe that this
was in fact due to left ventricular failure and they
recommended treating her failure including continued
diuresis.  They also noted that she had no pulmonary
contraindication to undergoing cardiac surgery.  Therefore,
on [**2136-5-22**], the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting times three.  She had saphenous vein graft to
LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM, and saphenous vein graft to
RCA.  Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 75 minutes.
Cross clamp time was 41 minutes.  Postoperatively, the
patient was taken intubated to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive
Care Unit.  In the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit she
was extubated on the evening of her operation and some of her
pressors including Milrinone were weaned off.  The chest
tubes were discontinued on the first postoperative day, as
was the J-P drain left in her leg.  However, this ultimately
required a total of six postoperative days in the Intensive
Care Unit.  This was primarily for aggressive pulmonary
toilet and for delirious mental status changes that responded
well to Haldol p.r.n.  During this time she was continued on
her normal perioperative course of Vancomycin in addition,
possible sources of her delirium were aggressively sought and
non appeared to have been found.  During all of the time the
white count remained stable in the 10 to 12 region and the
BUN and creatinine were also stable.

By the 7th postoperative day, the patient was transferred our
of Intensive Care onto the hospital floor.  On the floor, the
Lopressor was sequentially increased to a final dose of 75
b.i.d.  In addition, the Lasix was converted from IV to a
p.o. form as she continued to diurese and approached her
preoperative weight.  In addition, the physical therapy team
assessed her and noted her severe impairment and mobility.
They recommended rehabilitation upon discharge and felt that
she had good potential for return to her prior level of
functioning.

The patient had no other acute events during her
hospitalization.  It should be noted that the white blood
cell count on the day prior to her transfer did climb from 11
to 15.  However, on the day of her transfer it went back down
to 12.  During all this time, she remained afebrile.

On [**2136-5-30**], the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
TCU for further care.  It should be noted that her care
originated at [**Hospital6 **].  She is asked to
followup with her primary care physician in approximately two
weeks and to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in approximately four
weeks.

The patient is transferred on the following medications:
1.  Lasix 20 mg p.o.b.i.d.
2.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o.b.i.d.
3.  Heparin 5000 subcutaneously b.i.d.
4.  Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
5.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d.
6.  Protonix 40 mg p.o.q.d.
7.  Glyburide 2.5 mg p.o.q.d.
8.  Lopressor 75 mg p.o.b.i.d.
9.  Ibuprofen 400 mg p.o.q.4h.to 6h.p.r.n.
10. Tylenol 650 mg p.o.q.4h.to 6h.p.r.n.
11. Sliding scale regular insulin.

Of note:  Regarding the preoperative medications, we could
not find a definitive indication for Plavix and have not yet
restarted that, in addition to a likely need to have her
Norvasc, Diovan, and Lipitor restarted in the future, it is
unclear whether or not she will continue to need the higher
does of Lopressor or the higher dose of Lasix following her
operation.  It is recommended that she be followed
clinically.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass grafting times three.
2.  Pulmonary hypertension.
3.  Hypertension, treated.
4.  Non-Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus treated.
5.  Hyperlipidemia, treated.
6.  Severe arthritis and chronic low back pain.
