Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19836**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
brochoscopy

History of Present Illness:
75 y/o M with hx type 2 DM c/b ESRD and failed renal tx started
on HD 3 months ago, CAD s/p CABG, PVD, afib on coumadin who is
transferred from OSH for sepsis.
.
He had been in USOH until [**4-27**] when after HD he began to
experience fatigue, malaise, weakness and shaking chills. At OSH
ED, he received CTX 1 gm IV X1, azithromycin 500 mg IV X1, Vanc
1 gm X1, lantus 12 U X 1. No other medications were given
including home meds. Blood Cx drawn X 2 (one from HD line). CXR
c/w mild volume overload or possible pneumonia. He underwent HD
and was noted to be more lethargic. He was subsequently
transferred to ICU at OSH for declining mental status and T 104.
His HD line was removed at OSH. Per family request, he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Currently, he reports feeling much better. He denies any
pain,N/V/diarrhea/URI/hematuria/dysuria. He does endorse mild
non productive cough. He denies any CP, palpitations, SOB, DOE.
At baseline at home he walks 1 mile/day.

CXR [**5-1**]
The lungs are hyperinflated and diaphragms are flattened,
consistent with
COPD. There is borderline cardiomegaly with left ventricular
configuration.
The patient is status post sternotomy, with mediastinal clips.
The two lower sternotomy wires may be fractured, but are
unchanged compared with [**2096-10-18**]. The aorta is calcified and
slightly unfolded. ICD device with 3 leads is unchanged.
Lucencies are seen crossing several of the wires associated with
the leads, but this is also unchanged compared with [**2096-10-18**].

There is patchy opacity in the right suprahilar and perihilar
region and to a lesser extent in the right cardiophrenic region
and possible minimal
atelectasis at the left base. There is minimal blunting of right
and ? left
costophrenic angles, consistent with a small amount of pleural
fluid and/or
thickening.

IMPRESSION:

Compared with one day earlier and allowing for technical
differences, patchy perihilar opacity is probably unchanged.

OSH cultures ([**Hospital **] hospital)
HD line tip [**4-29**] coag neg staph (grew [**5-2**]), [**Last Name (un) 36**] to gent, vanc,
tetra, rifampin only
blood cultures 6/11 NGTD

Brief Hospital Course:
75 y/o M with CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 20%) with ICD, severe PVD,
DM c/b ESRD s/p failed transplant now on HD presents with
pneumonia.
.
# Fever: Etiology is most likely line infection vs pneumonia.
CXR consistent with pneumonia. Urine legonella and strep pneumo
negative at the OSH. Covered empirically with Vancomycin,
Ceftriaxone, and azithromycin but was broadened to vanco,
cefepime, and cipro for HCAP coverage given that he is at
dialysis centers. Beta glucan and galactomannan were sent.
Brochoscopy was performed for BAL on HD#2, and samples were
negative at time of discharge. Patient remained afebrile in the
ICU and was transferred to the floor on HD #2. His HD line tip
from the OSH grew Coag neg staph (see sensitivities on previous
page).  His fevers were therefore thought most likely to be due
to a line infection (without bacteremia as blood cultures were
still negative) and pneumonia.  He was switched to Vancomycin
and Levofloxacin only at time of discharge to complete a 10-day
course. Patient remained afebrile on the floor.
.
# ESRD s/p failed tx:  Renal was following along. Patient was
continued on cellcept and steroids, as well as bactrim
prophylaxis. After blood cultures were negative for 48 hours, a
tunneled line was placed by IR on the right side on [**5-2**] given
plans for eventually AV fistula on the left.
.
# HTN: BP medications held while in the ICU. These were
restarted on the floor.
.
# DM: lantus 12 units QAM and humulog SS AC only
.
# afib on coumadin: Coumadin held while awaiting new HD line. It
was restarted
