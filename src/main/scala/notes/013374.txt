Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
66M with severe COPD, chronically trached (capped), on 2L O2 at
baseline who presents with tachypnea. The patient was found to
be tachypneic and diaphoretic at his group home. When EMS was
called he was 82% on 2L, and came up to 99% on NRB. Denied chest
pain, abdominal pain, headache.
.
.
Notably, he had a recent MICU admission from [**Date range (1) 98536**] for COPD
exacerbation and pneumonia. Sputum cultures grew out Strep
pneumoniae, and the patient was treated with Ceftriaxone and
Levofloxacin. He was discharged on a steroid taper.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.2 91 151/77 32 100% 15L NRB. Exam
was notable for coarse rales on the L, green sputum around the
trach site, and accessory muscle use. EKG was without ST segment
changes. Blood cultures and a sputum culture were sent. CXR was
obtained. Patient was given Albuterol nebs x3, Ipratropium nebs
x3, Prednisolone 125mg IV x1, wtihout much relief. He was also
given Vancomycin 1g, Levofloxacin 500mg, and Ceftriaxone 1g.
Respiratory was called, and the patient was ventilated. Vitals
prior to transfer were T98 HR 91 BP 133/52 99% on facemask,
awaiting mechanical ventilation. With onset of mechanical
ventilation and sedation (2mg IV midazolam), the patient briefly
became hypotensive to 60s/40s. He was found to be autopeeping at
15. He received 2L IV fluids, and was briefly taken off the
ventilator, with resolution of hypotension. BPs prior to
transfer were 95-112/56-58. He was started on 0.15 peripheral
levophed.
.
.
.
On the floor, the patient is resting comfortably. He denies any
chest pain. He has had chills overnight, and only felt badly
yesterday. He states that 2 days ago, he felt completely well.
