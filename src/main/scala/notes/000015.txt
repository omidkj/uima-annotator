Brief Hospital Course:
1) ASTHMA FLARE:
On HD#2, patient was taken off continuous nebs, and was
increased to q4 hour intervals and was switched to PO steroids.
She then developed anion gap acidosis/elevated lactate that was
thought to be attributable to respiratory muscle breakdown. On
HD#3, patient was transferred to the floor, after neb treatments
were decreased to q4 hours. On transfer to the floor she
reported feeling much improved.  She was continued on PO
prednisone at 60mg.  She was also continued on Z-pak which had
been started in ICU due to productive cough depsite clear CXR.
Her nebs were spaced out to 6hours.  Her dyspnea resolved almost
completely though she still was wheezing on exam.  She will
complete a 2 week steroid taper, Z-pak.

2) Eosinophilia:
[**Month (only) 116**] be related to asthma and allergy.  There was also thought of
ABPA which can be worked up as an outpt.
