Chief Complaint:
STEMI s/p stenting of LAD

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**]

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 89 yo male with CAD s/p cath [**5-/2107**] (90% stenosis LAD s/p
atherectomy), dementia, CHF, DM, CRI presents to OSH with
tachypnea, found to have an STEMI, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cath. Pt presented to an OSH with SOB from his nursing home. He
had received 20 mg IV lasix prior to arrival at OSH per report.
Pt told OSH ED he had been "sick" the past two days. In the ED
at [**Hospital1 **], EKG showed atrial fibrillation, with STE laterally
and a rate of 130. He was given 300 mg ASA pr, 20 mg IV lasix.
He was also given 5 mg IV lopressor and converted to normal
sinus. CPK was 265, MB 69.3 (index 26%). Pt was transferred to
[**Hospital1 **] for catheterization on heparin gtt.

At cath, pt received heparin and 450 mg plavix. Catheterization
here showed 3VD. Because pt was not a candidate for CABG, a high
risk PCI was done and LAD stented with [**Hospital1 **] (80% prox lesion, 70%
distal lesion). Pt was transferred to CCU on dobutamine.

Radiology:
[**2119-4-23**] Portable Chest Xray-Asymmetrically distributed combined
alveolar and interstitial pattern with alveolar opacities more
prominent peripherally than centrally. Although possibly due to
an asymmetrical distribution of pulmonary edema from congestive
heart failure, ARDS and multifocal pneumonia should be
considered in the appropriate clinical setting. A more chronic
underlying interstitial process is not excluded without older
films for comparison.

[**2119-4-23**]- Cardiac catheterization-
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed multi-vessel coronary disease.  The LMCA was without
significant disease.  The LAD had an 80% proximal lesion and a
70% distal lesion.  The LCX gave off a large OM1 with a 60%
lesion.  The RCA contained a 70% lesion in the PDA.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed a reduced cardiac index of 1.4
l/m/m2.
Mean PCPW was mildly elevated at 14mmHg.
3. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.0x28mm
Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 5177**] at 16 atms (See PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Reduced cardiac output.
3. Acute anterior STEMI treated with stenting of the proximal
LAD with a
Drug ELuting Stent.

Echo 4/25/05-1. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is
severely depressed. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle.
3. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-1**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
8. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**2119-4-25**] Chest AP-Cardiomegaly and bilateral pulmonary vascular
congestion, most likely indicative of congestive heart failure.
The magnitude of which may be slightly less pronounced at this
time.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt came back from catheterization and was in a CHF exacerbation,
requiring 100 % NRB. It was thought that because of his atrial
fibrillation, he may have flashed or secondary to his MI. An
Echo was done which showed 15-20% EF, MR, TR, and AR. Pt was
unable to be weaned off of dobutamine. He also would have
episodes of SVT, became tachypnic over the course of the two
days, and was quite ill appearing. His code status was DNR/DNI
and he did not tolerate mask ventilation. The team spoke to pt's
family, who decided what his goals of care would have been and
it was decided to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**]. He was started on a morphine
drip for comfort. He was left on supplemental O2 (via shovel
mask) until all of his family arrived. After pt took it off
himself, the decision was made to leave it off. Pt passed away
at 11:05 am on [**2119-4-25**] with family at bedside.
