Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
Stroke

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation [**2111-5-31**]

History of Present Illness:
89 yo man with afib (not on coumadin), HTN, high chol, CAD, and
worsening renal function in past few months who is recently s/p
ureteral stent [**2111-5-18**], who presents as "CODE STROKE" at noon
after last known well time of 3AM, with severe dysarthria and L
arm>face>leg severe weakness after being found by his wife on
the
floor (presumably fell out of bed).  Pt returned from driving
trip to [**State 108**] 1 wk ago - had been hospitalized in [**State 108**] for
renal failure; en route to [**Location (un) **], pt fell in a hotel room.
Upon
arrival, wife took him to [**Hospital3 **] where he had renal w/u,
ureteral stent [**5-18**], and cardiac w/u for ? of ekg changes.  Pt
returned home and had been doing well in general with no
f/c/card
sx/resp/gi/gu/neuro sx until last night when he was "acting
strangely" per wife - was very disappointed that TV was broken
and pt could not watch [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 892**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41519**].  Went to bed at 10PM; pt
recalls waking up feeling "normal" around 3AM (checked watch),
and used urinal at side of bed, which has been instituted since
return from [**State **] for urinary sx and to prevent falling oob.
Wife thinks this "normal" period may have occurred later than
3AM
but she did not check her watch.  At 7AM wife woke up and pt
continued to sleep.  At 7:45 she called to him from next room.
She thinks she heard a "thump" - when she walked to the room,
she
found her husband on the floor, pressed up against the cabinet
on
L side, and when he tried to speak he was slurring his speech.
She called EMS and he was brought to [**Hospital3 **] Hosp, whereupon
[**Hospital1 18**] stroke fellow contact[**Name (NI) **] for further w/u and consideration
of intervention, and transfer arranged.  Pt arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] ER
at 12:00 and CODE STROKE called; stroke fellow and R3 present at
bedside within 4 minutes, and initial NIHSS score was 17, for:
level of consciousness (keeps eyes closed), partial gaze palsy
(cannot bury sclera on L), visual field cut and neglect on L, L
facial palsy, L arm with extension to nox stim only, and L leg
with triple-flexion to stimulation, L body sensory loss, severe
dysarthria, and extinction on the left to double simultaneous
stimulation (though significant sensory loss as well).  Pt could
tell some details of story above, but is markedly dysarthric and
slightly inattentive.  IV TPA, IA TPA, and MERCI retrieval
system
not indicated for pt presenting out of time window for each.


Past Medical History:
Worsening CRI - creat 8.2 in [**5-4**], s/p emergency cystoscopy and
ureteral stent in [**2111-5-18**] for R hydronephrosis; wife tells me
that after discussion with renal, family has opted not to pursue
dialysis
Afib s/p PPM/AICD
HTN
High chol
GI bleed [**Date Range 1686**] ago
"peripheral neuropathy" since lumbar back surgery [**15**]-15yrs ago
CAD, with "EKG changes in [**5-4**]" - per cards note, not acutally a
change from prior ([**5-15**]: afib, v-pacing, rbbb pattern with L ant
hemiblock, some nonspecific ST changes) - had cardiology w/u at
[**Hospital3 **] [**5-18**] and echo [**5-19**] showed EF of 60% with no wall
motion abnl (no clot), mod MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]


Social History:
Lives with wife; smoked from age 18-59 "never a lot" per wife,
quit 30 [**Name2 (NI) 1686**] ago; drinks [**12-30**] glasses of scotch/night; formerly
worked in sales, now retired


Family History:
mother had stroke at older age


Physical Exam:
T pending; HR 70  BP 156/90  RR 20  sats pending
General appearance: L face abrasions, bruises and abrasions over
L body; white male
HEENT: moist mucus membranes, clear oropharynx
Neck: in hard collar
Heart: irreg irreg
Lungs: clear to auscultation anteriorly
Abdomen: soft, nontender +bs
Extremities: warm, well-perfused

Mental Status: The patient is alert and awake but keeps eyes
closed and appears fatigued - DOW backwards is slightly slow;
did
not read sentences, but could repeat well; language is fluent
and
comprehension intact.  No obvious hand agnosia.  Could name
objects; field cut impaired interpretation of cookie picture.

Cranial Nerves: L field cut appears dense (vs severe neglect) -
no blink to threat on L. The optic discs could not be
visualized.
Eye movements sig. for inability voluntarily to move both eyes
much past midline to L (cannot bury sclera); could not perform
OCR due to hard collar.  Pupils react equally to light, both
directly and consensually.  Sensation on the face is decreased
to
LT over LUE>face>LLE.  Facial movements are notable for L facial
droop.  Hearing is intact to voice.  The palate appears to
elevate in the midline, though very difficult to visualize.  The
tongue protrudes in the midline and is of normal appearance;
speech markedly dysarthric.

Motor System:
Elev tone bilat LE; low tone in LUE
RUE with poor effort on strength exam, shows mild weakness of
triceps ([**4-2**]) and deltoid, though ?limited by pain, full at
biceps and finger/wrist flex and finger ext
RLE with full strength at IP, ham, quad, foot dorsi/plantarflex
LUE with extension posturing to nox stim only, o/w no spont mvmt
LLE with triple-flexion to gentle nox stim, vs purposeful w/d
R arm/hand is tremulous with mvmt, no drift on R.

Reflexes: The tendon reflexes are diminished on LUE, trace at
knees, absent at ankles, 2+ at RUE.  L toe is up, R down.

Sensory: Sensation is nl to LT, pp on L, cannot feel LT on L
arm,
leg, slt on face.  +EXT to dss over entire L side but sensory
loss.

Coordination: There is no ataxia of R hand, cannot move L hand
voluntarily.

Gait:  cannot be performed

CT head [**2111-5-26**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Study is limited due to motion artifacts.

2. No acute intracranial abnormality noted on the CT head.

3. Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine, most
prominent at C5-6 with moderate-to-severe spinal canal narrowing
at that level.

4. 1-cm hypodense lesion in the right lobe of the thyroid, which
could represent a complex cyst or a mass. This can be better
evaluated with ultrasound of the thyroid.

5. Moderate left maxillary sinusitis with air-fluid level.

CT head [**2111-5-27**]:
FINDINGS: There has been interval development of a large region
of hypodensity involving the right middle cerebral artery
territory. There is no significant shift of normally midline
structures. There is no hydrocephalus. No intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage is identified. None of the visualized vessels appear
hyperdense on the current study.

There is opacification of the left maxillary sinus, and partial
opacification of the left mastoid air cells. Intracavernous
internal carotid artery calcifications are noted.

IMPRESSION: Evolving acute right middle cerebral artery infarct.
No evidence of herniation. No evidence of hemorrhagic
transformation.

Carotid u/s [**2111-5-26**]:
There is a less than 40% right ICA stenosis and a 60-69% left
ICA stenosis. There is antegrade flow in the right vertebral
artery and the left vertebral artery is unable to be visualized.
