History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13004**] is an 81 year old man with a h/o thalamic hemorrhagic
stroke 1 year ago, recent GI bleed s/p EGD showing 3 duodenal
ulcers who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with melanotic stools, HCT
drop from 29->21.

The patient was recently admitted from [**Date range (3) 86309**] for
melena and HCT drop, and EGD revealed 3 duodenal ulcers. He was
given 1 unit of blood and discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with plans
for outpatient colonoscopy. Biopsies were negative for H pylori,
CMV, but did reveal [**Female First Name (un) **] infection, which has not yet been
treated.

Since then he has complained of [**3-5**] periumbilical pain,
nonradiating, dull and achy that does not change with eating
meals. He has not had nausea or vomitting. He denies recent
NSAID or alcohol use. He does report melena. He was seen by the
MD on call at [**Hospital **] Rehab who found his HCT to drop from 29 to
21.5, and therefore sent him to the ED.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.3 84 138/74 16 100% RA. An NG
lavage revealed red flecks of blood in clear fluid. Two
peripheral IVs were placed and he was given pantoprazole 80mg IV
ONCE followed by a drip at 8mg/hr. GI was consulted who
recommended EGD in the AM. Although he was never hypotensive,
tachycardic or actively bleeding, he was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
out of concern for impending GI bleed.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was comfortable but
complaining of mild periumbilical pain. The patient was
subsequently stabilized in the medical ICU with blood
transfusions and he underwent EGD with local therapy for the
bleeding ulcer site.

Once he was hemodynamically stable, the patient was transferred
to the hospital medicine service for ongoing management.

[**5-21**] EGD:
The exam of esophagus was normal. The exam of stomach was
normal. A visible vessel with spurting blood was seen in the mid
of an ulcer on the lateral wall of duodenal sweep.  Attempts to
place the hemoclips were made. A clip was misplaced at the side
of the visible vessel. Placement of two other clips was not
successful due to the scar tissue. Then a gold probe was applied
for hemostasis successfully with the visible vessel cauterized.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

[**5-30**] EGD: Healing ulcer site at the distal bulb, no vissible
vessel or bleeding seen at this site. Edema of the mucosa with
stigmata of bleeding form an area of duodenitis at the apex of
the duodenal bulb. A gold probe was applied for hemostasis
successfully.

[**5-31**] Colonoscopy: Polyp in the ascending colon. Grade 2 internal
hemorrhoids. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.

Brief Hospital Course:
81-year-old male with history of thalamic hemorrhagic stroke 1
year ago, recent GI bleed s/p EGD showing 3 duodenal ulcers who
presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with melanotic stools, HCT drop from
29->21, eventually underwent an EGD showing a bleeding vessel in
the duodenum with successful hemostasis. He had a number of
blood transfusions with a few more melanotic stools and hct
drops throughout the hospitalization. A repeat EGD showed
healing ulcers and no evidence of bleed.

# GI bleed: He had 3 duodenal ulcers on a previous
hospitalization. A repeat EGD ([**5-21**]) showed evidence of an
active bleeding vessel in the middle of an ulcer on the lateral
wall of the duodenum. Several unsuccessful attempts to place
hemostat clips were made. The vessel was eventually cauterized
and hemostasis was achieved. He was treated with high dose
pantoprazole. He remained hemodynamically stable. He received 2
packed RBCs and had a stable hematocrit for a few days. He was
transitioned to an oral PPI and transferred to the general
medical [**Hospital1 **]. He then had an episode of melena with a 4 point
hematocrit drop. His hemodynamics were again stable. His
hematocrit remain stable and uptrended for the next couple of
days. However, he again had melena and had a 4 point hematocrit
drop. Due to this he was transfused 1 unit of packed RBCs with
appropriate increase in hematocrit. He had a repeat EGD with
improvement of ulcers. Given that no source of bleeding was
found, he was prepped and underwent colonoscopy which did not
show any area of bleeding but did show a polyp. He should have a
repeat colonoscopy in 6 months for removal of this polyp. His
hematocrit was stable for >72 hours at the time of discharge
(and was increasing). He should get repeat hematocrit checks
twice weekly for the next couple of weeks to make sure his
hematocrit remains stable. This should be reported to the
medical staff at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.

# Epigastric pain: He continued to have epigastric pain, which
was somewhat improved throughout the admission. He was to
continue PPI.

# Heart failure: The patient has a contraindication to ACEi. His
ethacrynic acid was held during the admission. He was euvolemic
and the medication was not re-started. He should be evaluated at
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab as this medication may need to be restarted in the
future.

# Urinary incontinence: The patient was noted to have urinary
incontinence without evidence of acute infection. We received
information in collateral that this is not a new condition. He
was checked for post-void residuals by bladder scanner on
several occasions, which did not exceed 500cc. This was
monitor
