Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 81 year old gentleman with history of cirrhosis
secondary to hemachromatosis that developed from chronic
transfusions for thalassemia and recent onset HCC s/p cyberknife
treatment who presented after a five day history of falls and
was found to have a subdural hematoma.
.
#. Subdural Hematoma-
The patient is an 81 year-old gentleman with a history of
cirrhosis [**1-23**] hemachromatosis that developed from chronic
transfusions for thalassemia and recent onset HCC s/p cyberknife
treatment who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after a five day history
of falls. He had increasing confusion and balance difficulty
secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.  The patient continued to
have falls at home, the most recent of which occured at 2AM on
DOA. The patient states that he did not feel light-headed or
notice any palpications before falling, and feels that poor
vision was the primary reason he fell. A head-CT showed a L
parietal SDH with maximum diameter 14mm. He was seen by
neurosurgery and was admitted to the ICU for Q 1 neuro checks.
Because of his low platelet count of 46 and INR of 1.6, he was
give a six pack of platelets and 2 [**Location 16678**]. His platelets
overnight subsequently  rose to 74, and INR to 1.5. His
neurological exam remained stable.  On the morning of HD 2, he
remained stable, and was transferred out of the ICU to the
floor.

On [**3-3**], he was still to be noted to be with neurological
deficit (right pronator drift, lethargy, and AT/[**Last Name (un) 938**] RLE
weakness). Given this examination, surgery was pursued. However,
the family felt very strongly that this may not be medically in
his best interest. Hepatology was also involved due to his
medical history. After extensive conversation with NSURG
attending, Mr. [**Known lastname 96484**] daughter and Hepatology team, surgery
was cancelled. It was determined to watch Mr. [**Known lastname 96484**] SDH,
and manage it conservatively. In this setting, general medicine
was consulted to request a transfer of care to assist in the
management of Mr. [**Known lastname 96484**] hepatic encephalopathy.  The
patient ha two CT-scans that showed that the left parietal
subdural hematoma was stable on [**3-4**].  He was continued on
Dilantin 100mg TID for seizure prophylaxis with goal blood
levels of [**10-9**].  The patient was seen by neurosurgery daily and
remained stable without new neurologic deficits.  Mr. [**Known lastname 96483**]
will follow-up in [**Hospital 4695**] Clinic in 4 weeks after discharge
with repeat head CT to evaluate the hematoma.  He will also
continue dilantin 100mg TID until he follows up in neurosurgery
clinic.
.
#. Cirrhosis/HCC: Secondary to hemachromatosis from multiple
transfusions for his beta-thalassemia. His HCC is s/p cyberknife
therapy in [**10-29**] and his last MRI [**1-31**] inidcated interval
stability of multiple enhancing lesions with decrease in size of
the dominant lesion.  The patient's frequent falls was likely
secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.  Per report he was not
taking his lactulose or rifaximin properly.  Upon admission he
was followed by Hepatology and transferred to the Liver Service
on [**3-6**].  The patient was given lactulose 30ml TID titrated to 3
BM per day and rifaximin 600mg [**Hospital1 **]. He was also continued on
lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and Spironolactone 25mg [**Hospital1 **].  The patient's lasix
was decreased to 20mg daily on discharge due to hyponatermia.
The patient's LFT were trended and improved during his
admission.  His mental status improved with lactulose and
rifaximin.
.
#. Hyponatermia: The patient was admitted with a sodium of 132
that improved with IV fluids.  The sodium began to trend back
down and his lasix dose was decreased to 20mg daily.  Other
possibilities include liver disease or SIADH from his subdural.
His sodium should be monitored d
