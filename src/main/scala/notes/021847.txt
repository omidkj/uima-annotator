HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
female with a history of diverticulitis, lower GI bleed, DVT,
and PE who presents with acute onset of fever, generalized
shaking, and weakness.  Four days prior to arrival, the
patient was discharged from [**Location (un) 2716**] Point Rehabilitation
Center where she spent a week following discharge from [**Hospital1 18**]
on [**2184-7-13**] with a diagnosis of sigmoid diverticulitis.  She
had been discharged on Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole at
that time.  Two days prior to arrival, the patient began to
experience uncontrollable shaking in her arms and she states
that she began to feel extremely weak.  At that time, the
patient denied loss of consciousness and states that she
voluntarily laid down on the bathroom floor due to her
extreme fatigue and shaking.  She also denied any chills,
abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea,
vomiting, cough, vertigo, headache, melena, or any other
symptoms.

In the Emergency Room, on [**2184-7-28**], the patient had the
following vital signs:  Temperature 102, pulse 130, blood
pressure 96/56, respirations 18, saturating at 99 on room
air.  Her systolic blood pressure then fell to the 60s and
she was given 4 liters of intravenous fluids and started on
DA.  After this, her blood pressure returned to the 100s.
She was then given ceftriaxone 1 gram, ampicillin, and
metronidazole for presumptive sepsis.  The patient was
admitted to the MICU for treatment of hypotension.  Stool
cultures in the MICU were positive for Clostridium difficile.
Otherwise, the patient reported chronic diarrhea over the
past month and states that she would have up to [**10-31**] loose
stools a day.  She denied any bright red blood per rectum or
melena.  The patient also reports a loss of appetite since
[**2183-9-21**], believes that she has lost up to 20 pounds
in total.  Otherwise, on review of systems, the patient
reports diarrhea and states that her urine sometimes appears
more concentrated than usual.  She also reports moderate back
pain which she believes is the result of prolonged bed rest.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On [**2184-7-29**], white count
15.4, hematocrit 29.8, platelets 411,000.  Also, on [**2184-7-30**], her BMP is as follows:  Sodium 138, potassium 3.5,
chloride 107, bicarbonate 23, BUN 4, creatinine 0.8, and
glucose 84.  On [**2184-7-30**], PT 16, PTT 28.2, INR 1.7.  On
[**2184-7-30**], calcium 8.3, phosphorus 2.9, magnesium 1.7.  On
[**2184-7-28**], her ALT was 9, AST 22, LDH 371, lipase 20, albumin
3.2, CK 26, alkaline phosphatase 71, amylase 21, total
bilirubin 0.6, cortisol 46.3.

The fecal analysis on [**2184-7-29**] was positive for C. difficile
toxin.

EKG on [**2184-7-29**] revealed rate of 85 beats per minute, PR 152,
QRS 140, QT/QTC 404/446.14, sinus rhythm, revealing prior
inferior MI, right bundle branch block, and diffuse
low-voltage.

Urinalysis was normal.  Blood cultures are pending.

Chest x-ray revealed no evidence of pneumonia or effusion.

Chest CT done on [**2184-7-28**] revealed mild emphysematous changes
present especially at the right lung base, two small nodules,
4 mm, were present in the right apex and right middle lobe.
There was also a 12 mm right hilar lymph node, no PE or
effusion was noted.

Abdominal CT with IV contrast was done on [**2184-7-28**] and
revealed a small hypodense lesion in the posterior aspect of
the right hepatic lobe which probably represented a cyst.

Pelvic CT with IV contrast on [**2184-7-28**] revealed significant
thickening of the sigmoid colon with surrounding phlegmonous
inflammatory changes suspicious for diverticulitis.  A
complicated bowel tumor was also noted as a possibility.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  The patient is a 77-year-old female with a
history of DVT, PE, diverticulitis, and lower GI bleed who
presented with acute onset of fever, weakness, generalized
shaking.  In addition, the patient reports chronic diarrhea
for at least the last month in duration and anorexia since
[**2183-9-21**].  She also reports a weight loss of up to
20 pounds, hypotension.  The patient was normotensive upon
transfer to the medical service.  Her blood pressures were
stable around 120-130/60-70.  The etiology of her hypotension
remained unknown.  Sepsis remained a possibility since the
patient presented to the ED with hypotension, tachycardia,
fever, and chills.  However, anaerobic and aerobic blood
cultures remained negative.  Another possibility was
hypovolemia given the patient's history of chronic diarrhea.
Other considerations included adrenal insufficiency which was
ruled out by an elevated cortisol of 46.3 on the date of
admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  During her hospital course on the general
medicine service, the patient's blood pressures remained in
the normotensive range, ranging from 120-130/60-70.  She had
no further episodes of hypotension and maintained good
hydration.

2.  DIARRHEA:  The patient had been having chronic diarrhea
for the past month.  It waxed and waned in frequency to some
extent but persisted for at least one month without
significant change in color or consistency.  The patient
asserts that she had never had bright red blood per rectum or
black stools.  A positive finding of C. difficile toxin in
stool cultures suggested that a diarrhea could be from C.
difficile induced colitis.  This was supported by the
patient's presentation with leukocytosis and fever as well as
the finding of colonic wall thickening on pelvic CT.

For her colitis, the patient was maintained on a regimen of
ciprofloxacin, Flagyl, and ampicillin with good result.  She
was discharged on Cipro and ampicillin.

3.  DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS/PE PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was
maintained on enoxaparin sodium 70 mg subcutaneously q. 12
hours in addition to Warfarin until she maintained a
therapeutic INR.  Pneumatic boots were also ordered
