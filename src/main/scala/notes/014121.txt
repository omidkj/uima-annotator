History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 93749**] is a 77 yo nun with h/o CHF and DM who presents with
fevers, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea x 1 day. Pt states she was
able to eat breakfast this afternoon but throughout the day she
developed severe diarrhea and episodes of emesis. She thinks she
vomited 5-6 times and had multiple episodes of watery diarrhea.
She did not note blood in her emesis or stools. She did have
chills but no fevers prior to presentation. She was unable to
keep any food down during the day. She does note another sister
had diarrhea and vomiting recently for 2-3 days that resolved on
its own. She believes their symptoms were d/t food poisoning but
does not recall eating any "funny" foods. She denies fevers,
abdominal pain, CP, SOB, recent travel or abx. EMS was called
and found her in a pool of diarrhea. She was then brought to [**Hospital1 **].


In the ER she was initially afebrile with HR 107 and BP 84/60.
Rectal temp was then noted to be 103.2 and istat lactate 6.5. Pt
was given 2 L of IVFs and SBPs trended was in the 80s. She had a
subclavian line placed and was treated with levaquin and flagyl.
She was given a dose of toradol for chronic backpain and tylenol
for fever. Her CVP was noted to be 2 so she was given an
additional liter of IVFs and levophed gtt was started. Repeat
lactate was 3.4.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo female with h/o CHF, DM with acute gastroenteritis and
sepsis (hypotension requiring pressors, elevated lactate).

1. Sepsis: Patient admitted with fevers, hypotension,
tachycardia and elevated lactate, likely [**2-12**] to underlying
gastrointestinal infection. No evidence of pulmonary, urinary,
or blood infection. Stool studies negative, ? viral
gastroenteritis vs. transient bacteremia. Hemodynamically
stable, off antibiotics, tolerating PO by time of discharge.

2. Diarrhea and vomiting: Symptoms of diarrhea, fevers and
vomiting seem consistent with an acute viral or bacterial
gastroenteritis. This in conjunction with a recent ill contact
and bandemia makes an infectious etiology most likely. Stool
studies negative suggesting viral gastroenteritis, possibly
leading to transient bacteremia from GI source. Diarrhea and
emesis have stopped soon after admission, tolerating PO. Dig
toxicity considered but level 1.2. LFTs, amylase/lipase nl.

3. CHF: EF and etiology not known. Volume overload on exam after
aggressive resuscitation in the ICU for sepsis, diuresed with
40mg IV lasix x2 prior to discharge. Tolerating digoxin, started
on metoprolol and captopril [**12-13**], BP tolerating these (of note
pt. states stopped taking BB few years ago out of concern for it
causing cancer so this was stopped prior to discharge and she
was transitioned back to home lisinopril-2.5mg po qd). She was
discharged to resume home lasix, oxygenation stable on room air.

4. ARF: Presenting Cr was 1.7 with BUN of 41, likely secondary
to dehydration/sepsis with end-organ damage. Improved to 0.6-0.7
with IVF (baseline 0.8 in [**2135**]).

5. DM: Continue home medication of glucophage 500mg po tid and
glyburide. Given her history of CHF, her primary care physician
may consider transitioning her off Glucophage.

6. Glaucoma: cont timolol eye gtt.

7. Weight loss: ill-defined, associated with decreased appetite,
recent colonoscopy per her that was negative. Recommend
outpatient follow-up and age-appropriate cancer screening
(mammogram).

8. Anemia: decreased hct in the setting of aggressive IVF
resuscitation, stable since, normocytic, no baseline for
comparison, iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease, vitamin
b12 low and folate wnl, retic mod. low. Started on vitamin B12
supplement, will need to have that monitored as outpatient.
