Chief Complaint:
bilateral ear pain, cough, shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88348**] is a 24 y/o M with remote history of childhood asthma
presenting with worsening cough and shortness of breath over the
past two weeks.  His illness began with bilateral ear aches [**2-19**]
weeks ago. This was also accompanied by fevers measured to be
103 degrees. His ear pain resolved somewhat, but he has had
ongoing dyspnea and productive cough with large amounts of
yellow sputum since then. He had one episode of blood-tinged
sputum, in the setting of blowing his nose and coughing
frequently. He presented to an outpatient provider approximately
two weeks prior to admission who prescribed him a six-day course
of azithromycin. He had a mild improvement in his symptoms and
also took amoxicillin.

One day prior to admission, his symptoms progressed. He
presented to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] Emergency Dept with worsening
dyspnea. In the ED, his initial vital signs were 98.0, 96,
111/72, 88% RA. Exam was notable for pale skin, diminished lung
sounds at left base, no wheezes or rhonchi. CXR was notable for
LLL PNA, but no cavitary lesions. He was transiently placed on
TB precautions, which were discontinued after his CXR came back.
He was given doxycycline 100 mg IV ceftriaxone 1g IV, vancomycin
1g, and levofloxacin 500 mg PO, as well as multiple doses of
duonebs and 2 liters of IV fluids. CTA was obtained, showing
complicated PNA. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer
monitoring.

Upon arrival to the ICU, he felt his breathing was improved and
he was not feeling dyspneic as long as his oxygen mask is on. He
endorsed a poor appetite, a 20 lb weight loss, and drenching
sweats over the past two weeks. He reported no nausea, vomiting,
or abdominal pain.

 - Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen. Specimen screened
for: Adeno, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, Influenza A, B, and RSV by
immunofluorescence.

RADIOLOGY:
1. initial CXR and CT performed at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]

2. [**2133-1-19**] portable CXR: No previous images. The heart is normal
in size and there is no vascular congestion. There is increased
opacification involving the left base with obliteration of the
hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle. This is consistent with
atelectasis and effusion. However, the possibility of pneumonia
would have to be seriously considered in the appropriate
clinical setting.

3. [**2133-1-21**] portable CXR: AP chest compared to large area of left
lower lobe consolidation and a smaller region on the right have
both improved minimally since [**1-19**]. Small bilateral pleural
effusions persist. Upper lungs are clear. Heart size is normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88348**] presented with respiratory distress after 2 weeks of
URI and ear symptoms. By symptoms and serology he likely had a
Mycoplasma pneumonia in mid-[**Month (only) 1096**] and developed a bacterial
super-infection resulting in a lobar pneumonia. There was no
clear organism for his worsening pneumonia but he improved with
Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Ceftriaxone. He completed 5 days
of treatment with Vancomycin while hospitalized and will
complete a 2 week course of Levofloxacin and Cefpodoxime on
[**2133-1-30**].

His hospital course was complicated by anemia, elevated INR,
transaminitis, and persistent hypoxia after improvement of his
pneumonia. The anemia and transaminitis were thought to be from
his Mycoplasma pneumonia. The elevated INR was thought to be
from critical illness and improved with supportive care and
supplemental vitamin K. His persistent pneumonia required a few
extra days of hospitalization and improved with encouraged
ambulation, incentive spirometry, and chest physical therapy. At
the time of discharge, he was able to ambulate around the
hospital floor without dyspnea. He had O2 sats of 98% at rest on
room air and 95% with ambulation on room air. On examination he
continued to have diminished breath sounds at his left base with
no other abnormal lung findings.

He will follow-up with his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], on [**1-26**]. He will need
repeat LFTs, INR, and consideration for a repeat CXR to ensure
resolution of his pneumonia.
