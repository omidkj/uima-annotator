Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**]
Chief Complaint:
wheezing, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4194**] is a 46 year-old woman with a history of moderate
persistent asthma, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus,
who presented to the Emergency Department with approximately
five days of a productive cough with wheezing, coryza, nasal
congestion, and mild dyspnea.  She had had intermittent "hot
flashes" (which she does not fully characterize as fevers) and
occasional chills.  She had her son administer chest PT at home,
which helped her mobilize some dark yellow secretions; she also
experienced mild relief from OTC mucolytics, but no relief from
NyQuil.  She reports that her daughter is developing URI
symptoms.
.
She initially went to [**Company 191**] on the day of presentation with these
symptoms.  There, she was noted to be afebrile with peak flows
200-230 (the patient does not check her baseline peak flow) and
was referred to the Emergency Department for nebulizer therapy
and corticosteroids; no O2sat was noted at the clinic visit.
.
In the Emergency Department, she was afebrile, BP 122/96, HR 94,
RR 16, Sat 98% on room air.  Her peak flow went from 150 to 370
with three nebulizers.  She was also given prednisone 60mg, and
azithromycin.  A CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia.  After her
third nebulizer treatment (and, reportedly, the patient briefly
leaving the ED for a cigarette), she was noted to be 87% on room
air, and improved up to 94% on 3L n.c.  She was transferred to
the MICU for continuous O2sat monitoring.
.
Of note, she had not yet received this year's influenza
vaccination.
.
Review of Systems:
The patient reports recent "hot flashes" but is unsure if these
represented actual fevers.  She denies abdominal pain, diarrhea,
chest pain, hematochezia, headaches, visual changes, night
sweats, or weight loss.

history unknown.  No siblings.  Both children had childhood
asthma when young, but have outgrown it.


Physical Exam:
T 98.7  BP 150/85  HR 110  RR 16  Sat 98% on 2L n.c.
Peak Flow: pending
General: well-appearing obese woman, breathing comfortably and
speaking in full sentences
HEENT: OP clear; no scleral icterus
Chest: diffuse expiratory wheezing with prolonged expiratory
phase; no rales or ronchi
CV: tachycardic, regular, normal s1s2, no murmurs or rubs
Abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended, normal bowel sounds, no
hepatosplenomegaly
Extremities: no edema, cyanosis; warm; 2+ PT pulses
Neuro: alert, oriented x3, CN 2-12 intact, 5/5 strength in both
arms and legs


Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2190-1-5**]):
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Pulmonary
vasculature is normal.  The lungs are clear without focal
consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.  The osseous
structures are unremarkable.
.
ECG ([**2190-1-5**]):
Normal sinus rhythm at 83 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals.
Old Q-waves in anterior leads, V4-V6. No ST/T-wave changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
46 year-old woman with an active smoking history presenting with
an exacerbation of ?asthma in the setting of an upper
respiratory infection.  Prior spirometry (from [**2175**]), however,
not consistent with an obstructive llung disease.
.
Plan:
# Asthma, exacerbation triggered by URI: Patient carries a
diagnosis of asthma, though her old spirometry values do not
seem consistent with an obstructive picture since her FEV1/FVC
was elevated and she did not have a remarkable response to a
bronchodilator.  It is possible that her degree of lung disease
has progressed since this time, and she would thus merit repeat
spirometry.  Judging by the frequency of her albuterol use, she
qualifies as moderate persistent asthma, though her degree of
impairment does not seem to be terribly severe.
- Patient was started on agressive nebulizer treatments, and
prednisone course with good response.  On transfer to the floor
she was on 40mg PO Prednisone (after 2 days at 60mg).  Patient's
exam was notable only for scant wheezes with forced expiration,
and at discharge she was able to ambulate without desaturation.
Room air sat at discharge was 94%.  She was given a steroid
taper, albuterol and atrovent MDI's, and fluticasone.  She
completed her 5 day course of azithromycin on day of discharge.
.
# Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Covered with RISS during hospital
stay.  Restarted on metformin prior to d/c and glyburide on d/c.
.
#Sinus Tachycardia: Patient was mildly tachycardic during her
stay in the ICU.  Work-up was non-revealing as no pain, no
fever, no dehydration and thought [**3-13**] to albuterol nebulizers
and deconditioning.  TSH nml.  At discharge she was not
tachycardic but with exertion (walking the floor) became mildly
tachy to 110's.  Patient was taking good PO's and not felt to be
orthostatic.
.
# Hypertension: Amlodipine was added in the ICU for additional
BP control, and was continued on discharge.  Patient was
continued on the remainder of her anti-hypertensive medications.
.
#Smoking: Patient was given smoking cessation counseling prior
to discharge.  She agreed to attempt to quit, and requested
nicotine patches for assistance.  Plans to discuss further with
her PCP on discharge.
.
#Remainder of her hospital course was uneventful.  She was full
code throughout her stay.
