ADMIT NOTE
Date: [**2192-3-13**]
Time: 2200

HPI: 72 yo M with NSCLC with brain mets s/p parietal/occipital
crani for tumor resection on [**2192-2-3**], relatively new bilateral
frontal hemorrhagic mets scheduled for neurosurgical resection
next week now s/p WB XRT with progressive weakness now with
hematuria x 1 week, worsening thrombocytopenia. Per patient's
son, his father and mother have been staying with him and he has
been providing much of the care for his father. [**Name (NI) **] was unaware
that his father was having hematuria until yesterday when his
urine was noted to be dark red. He has also had hemoptysis for a
number of months but worsening in the past 1-2 weeks with
tablespoon of hemoptysis nearly every time he coughs. The cough
is associated with right sided chest pain in the front and back.
 Labs are significant for worsening thrombocytopenia of unclear
etiology.

[**3-12**] MRI: Three markedly enlarged hemorrhagic metastases have
progressed
dramatically since the brain MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2192-2-4**]. The
largest of these
measures 35 mm in greatest diameter. Other small metastatic
lesions appear
unchanged.

[**3-13**] CT head: One right and two left frontal hemorrhagic lesions
with surrounding edema, concerning for metastasis. These lesions
were seen in the MRI of [**2192-3-12**], but new since the CT of
[**2192-2-3**]. No new hemorrhage. No midline shift. Prominent
bilateral extra-axial spaces, likely subdural hygromas.

[**3-13**] CXR: PRELIM Consolidation in the lingular segment of the
left lung, is
consistent with known diagnosis of lung cancer. No new pulmonary
pathology
identified.

Pathology Report Tissue: RIGHT PARIETAL LESION. Study Date of
[**2192-3-15**] White matter and blood clot. No tumor identified,
levels x3.

[**3-15**] MRI Brain- IMPRESSION: Previously noted enhancing lesions in
the brain on the MRI of [**2182-3-12**] again identified for WAND study
for surgical planning. No midline shift or hydrocephalus. No
change in the size of the lesion seen since the previous study.

[**3-15**] NCHCT: IMPRESSION: Status post right frontal craniotomy and
resection of right frontal hemorrhagic metastasis with expected
intralesional and intracranial post-surgical changes. Stable
appearance of left frontal hemorrhagic metastasis and left
parieto-occipital encephalomalacia from prior resection.  Stable
bilateral subdural hygromas.

[**3-16**] ECG: FINDINGS: The patient has been extubated. Left upper
lobe consolidation has improved. This pattern is consistent with
an obstructive pneumonia consistent with known lingular mass.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size is
within normal limits.

[**3-21**] LENI's: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo M with NSCLC with brain mets s/p parietal/occipital crani
for tumor resection on [**2192-2-3**], relatively new bilateral
frontal hemorrhagic mets scheduled for neurosurgical resection
next week now s/p WB XRT with progressive weakness now with
hematuria x 1 week, worsening thrombocytopenia.

On [**3-13**], The patient completed WBXRT- 3500 cGy over 14 fractions
and was sent to the Emergency Department. He presented with
hematuria,thrombocytopenia, and hemoptysis. The patient had a
Head CT which was consistent with multiple known hemorrhagic
metastases in bifrontal lobes. There was no new intracranial
hemorrhage. The patient was admitted to Oncology with plans to
prepare the patient for surgery on Friday with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a
craniotomy for resection of brain mass.  The platlet level was
69.

On [**3-15**], The patient went to the Operating Room for an elective
craniotomy for resection of brain mass with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was recovered in the
intensive care unit. The goal systolic blood pressure was < 140.
The post operative Head Ct was consistent with expected post
operative changes.  The patient was alert and oriented to person
and place at baseline the patient never knows date.  He was
moving all extremities and exhibited his baseline level of left
sided weakness. The goal was to keep the patient platlets > 80
for 24 hours post surgery. A blood sample was sent to the lab
and the patient was found to be HEPARIN DEPENDENT ANTIBODIES
  Positive.  The patient was not started on prophylactic SQ
Heparin as a result. Venodyne boots were on at all times and
mobility was encouraged.

On [**3-16**], POD #2 the patient continued to have a production
productive cough/hemoptysis.  He was able to independently raise
secretions and was using a hand held suction independently.  A
CXR was performed in the afternoon which was consistent with
left upper lobe consolidation which had improved. The pattern
was consistent with an obstructive pneumonia consistent with
known lingular mass. There was no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. The heart size was within normal limits. The
platlets were 67 and the patient was transfused with 1 pack of
platlets and p
