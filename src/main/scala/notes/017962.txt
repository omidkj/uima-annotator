Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13129**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE with cardioversion [**2128-4-30**]


History of Present Illness:
51 year old male with history of morbid obesity, hemoptysis,
depression, OSA, lymphedema, psoriasis who presents with
worsening shortness of breath from home. He states that two
weeks ago, he noticed onset of dyspnea initially on exertion and
eventually also with sitting. He felt some nasal congestion so
self-medicated with Mucinex. One week ago, he noticed paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea even though he uses CPAP, up to every 1.5
hours. The patient also endorses nausea, no vomiting with
abdominal pain (deep, achy, in the middle of his stomach, not
postprandial), increased abdominal girth and ?night sweats X5
days. The patient also reports decreased urine output at home,
with urination twice in the last two days. Denied chest pain,
pleuritic chest pain. Denies cough, sputum, fevers at home
although ?night sweats recently. No hemoptysis.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T97.0 P130 BP122/palp R40 O2 sat 97%
on NRB. Appeared to be working hard to breath. Patient was given
aspirin 325mg, Levofloxacin 750mg IV, Ceftriaxone 1 gram IV.
Reportedly en route with EMS, patient was reported to be in
atrial fibrillation with RVR (HR130s). Continues to be
tachycardic in the 100s but tolerating bipap (O2 sat 100%). BNP
elevated in [**2117**] but no priors to received Lasix 40mg IV
(naive), no nitroglycerin. 18 gauge PIV placed, attempting
second PIV. On transfer, afebrile, BP124/74, RR24, HR110, 100%
on Bipap. Foley placed with 400cc urine output.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient states he feels "much better"
than when he came in. Mentating, able to hold conversation,
tolerating Bipap.

ECG [**2128-4-27**]:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Generalized
low voltages. Delayed R wave progression with late precordial
QRS transition is non-specific but cannot exclude possible prior
anterior wall myocardial infarction. Clinical correlation is
suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2126-5-15**] atrial
fibrillation has replaced sinus rhythm and generalized low
voltages are now present.

Portable CXR [**2128-4-27**]:
IMPRESSION:
Limited exam. Low lung volumes. Pulmonary edema with partially
imaged bibasilar airspace opacities, which could represent
atelectasis or infection. Widening of the mediastinum may be
secondary to technique and poor inspiratory effort. Recommend
repeat PA and lateral chest radiographs when patient is able for
further assessment.

TTE [**2128-4-28**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular
