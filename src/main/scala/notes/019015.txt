Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Atrial flutter, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

2. Cardiac catheterization [**2160-2-12**]
3. Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33463**] is a 63 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for HTN and IDDM admitted for aflutter s/p cardioversion
complicated by flash pulmonary edema. The patient reports that
over the past 2 weeks he has had some chest pressure, "high up"
that had been attributed to the NSAIDs and Tramadol he had been
taking for his hip pain (OA). The worst pain he felt was [**12-24**]
days ago, [**8-20**] pressure and burning sensation with associated
SOB in the evening. He went to see his doctor the next day and
got omeprazole for GERD, muscle relaxers for his hip pain, and
felt better. Then last night, he had [**6-20**] chest pressure and SOB
after walking up a flight of stairs. He denies associated
nausea, vomiting, palpitations. He said the SOB and pressure
sensation is worse with deep breaths. He denies any prolonged
travel, previous history of PE's, DVT's. Pt states that chest
pressure is slightly worsened by leaning back.
He called his PCP today as he noted a FSBS of 425 for 12 hours
(A1c checked last week 7.1).  He also endorses associated
malaise and URI symptoms including nasal congestion, night
sweats, but denies fever, chills, sore throat, myalgias or sick
contacts. His PCP's office then instructed the patient to go to
the Emergency Department for further evaluation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 98.0 83 127/78 18 98%RA.  He
received 6 mg adenosine, with rhythmn strip demonstrating
underlying flutter waves. He then received 20 mg IV diltiazem
push with resulting hypotension for which he received calcium
gluconate and IVF with good response. At that time, repeat ECG
demonstrated persistent STE in the inferior leads, and underwent
DCCV with resulting conversion to sinus rhythm.  Post
cardioversion, he developed hypoxemia felt to be due to flash
pulmonary edema and he was placed on NIPPV with CPAP and a nitro
gtt.  Had intermittent emesis, got zofran. A bedside TTE at that
time was of poor quality but did not demonstrate any focal wall
motion abnormalities. He was then admitted to the CCU for
further management. Prior to transfer, switched to NRB. Treated
with 10 units insulin x2 in ED. UA prior to transfer negative.
Prior to transfer, VS 94 124/65 25 99% NRB.
.
Currently, the patient is having some gas pains, and having [**2-21**]
chest pressure with some SOB. He was feeling well, and then
developed nausea and emesis. BP's remained stable, but had
intermittent hypoxia into 80's on 100% NRB. Switched to CPAP.

ROS: Pt had recent black stool this am, but denied bloody
stools.
He has had right hip since [**Month (only) **], that has been limiting his
activities, and has been getting worse. He has been seen in
clinic, and given medications for pain control, though without
much relief.
Otherwise negative for fever, chills, history of CVA, DVT's,
PE's, myalgias, abdominal pain.

Past Medical History:
IDDM

STUDIES:
TTE [**2160-2-11**]:
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion. Study is technically
inadequate to evaluate for tamponade physiology.
.
TTE [**2160-2-12**]:
Conclusions
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a small
to moderate sized pericardial effusion. There are no RV
diastolic invagination seen, and no other echocardiographic
signs of tamponade, although the patient is quite tachycardic,
making definite exclusion of tamponade by echo challenging.
Results were discussed in person with the team caring for the
patient and the decision was to assess for pericardial tamponade
with invasive hemodynamics.
.
TTE [**2160-2-18**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with normal left
ventricular diastolic function. Th
