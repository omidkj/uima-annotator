Service:  Cardiothoracic

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old
woman with left circumflex stent in [**2113-7-30**] after a
non Q-wave myocardial infarction with recent return of angina
at rest x2 weeks, referred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for a diagnostic catheterization from [**Hospital3 28116**].  On catheterization prior to her stenting in [**2113-7-30**], the patient had an LAD with a total occlusion, a
proximal circumflex of 90% at the OM1 and an RCA of 50%.  Her
ejection fraction at that time was 45%.  She has done well
since then with no recurrence of symptoms.  Two weeks ago,
she had an acute onset of nocturnal angina, took two
sublingual nitroglycerin with relief.  She saw her primary
care provider and was started on nitroglycerin paste and is
now referred back for catheterization.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 28117**] with
[**Last Name (LF) 15560**], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 28118**].

LABORATORY DATA:  INR is 1.0.  White blood cell count is 8.5,
hematocrit 37.7, platelets 442.  Sodium is 140, potassium
4.6, chloride 101, CO2 31, BUN 18, creatinine 0.8, glucose
87.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:
GENERAL:  The patient feels well with no complaints of
shortness of breath or chest pain.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.
HEART:  Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2 with
no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
EXTREMITIES:  She has bilateral femoral pulses with a soft
bruit, trace dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender with no bruits.  She has been NPO
for cardiac catheterization.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization.  Please see
catheterization report for full details.  In summary, the
catheterization showed apical dyskinesis, inferior
hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 35%, LAD 100%
lesion, circumflex 60% mid lesion, RCA 75% mid lesion with
diffuse disease throughout.  The cardiothoracic surgical team
was consulted.  The patient was seen by cardiothoracic
surgery and the option of surgical intervention was discussed
with the patient.  She was accepted by cardiothoracic surgery
for coronary artery bypass grafting and on [**3-15**] she was
brought to the Operating Room where she underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting x3.  Please see the Operating Room
report for full details.  In summary, the patient had a
coronary artery bypass graft x3 with a left internal mammary
artery to the LAD, a saphenous vein graft to the PDA and a
saphenous vein graft to OM1.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred from the Operating Room to
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  She did well
immediately postoperatively and was extubated on the day of
her surgery.  She remained hemodynamically stable overnight
on a small dose of Neo-Synephrine which was weaned off on the
morning of postoperative day #1.  She remained
hemodynamically stable off the Neo-Synephrine and was
transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care
and cardiac rehabilitation.  Her chest tubes were
discontinued on postoperative day #1.

Over the next several days, the patient did well.  Her
activity level was increased.  Her only complaint throughout
the next several days was nausea felt to be related to the
Percocet which she was receiving for pain.  Percocet was
discontinued and nausea resolved.  On postoperative day #3,
the patient's Foley catheter was removed and on postoperative
day #5, the patient's temporary pacemaker wire was removed.
At that time, it was felt that the patient was
hemodynamically stable and her activity level was adequate
that she could be discharged to home and arrangements were
made for the patient to be discharged to home with a [**Month (only) **]
nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] physical therapy follow up at her home.
At the time of discharge, the patient's condition is stable.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.7??????, heart rate 67 sinus rhythm,

discharge weight is 72.6 kg.
GENERAL:  Alert and oriented x3, moves all extremities,

dry.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive

within a month and with her primary care provider also within
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] month.
