Pertinent Results:
[**1-7**] CXR: There is mild cardiomegaly. Mediastinal and hilar
contours are within normal limits. There is moderately severe
congestive heart failure indicated by upper zone [**Month/Day (1) 1106**]
redistribution and perihilar haze, and peribronchial cuffing and
[**Last Name (un) 16765**] lines. There is a small left effusion. No pneumothorax.
[**1-8**] Cath: 1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed a distal 80% LMCA plaque involving the ostial LCX and
LAD. The LAD had moderate diffuse disease and the LCX had a 90%
ostial lesion. The RCA was 100% occluded and filled by left to
right collaterals. 2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated
left and right-sided filling pressures. RASP was 15 mmHg, RVEDP
20 mm Hg, PASP 39 mm Hg, PCWP 43 mm Hg, and LVEDP 43 mm Hg.
Systemic arterial pressure was normal with an SBP of 131 mm Hg.
3. Left ventriculography was performed and showed an EF of 60%
with 2+ mitral regurgitation. 4. 80 mg IV lasix was administered
for diuresis.
[**1-12**] Echo: PRE BYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta
confirmed by epi-aortic scanning,. Cross clamp and canullation
sights were based on epiaortic scan. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. POST BYPASS: Preserved
biventricular systolic function is preserved. The study is
otherwise unchanged fom prebypass.
[**1-16**] CXR: Small bilateral pleural effusions greater on the left
side are unchanged allowing the difference in positioning and
technique. Adjacent bibasilar atelectases are slightly improved.
The patient is post-median sternotomy and CABG. Small anterior
pneumomediastinum is present. Mild generalized interstitial
pulmonary abnormality is unchanged from [**2109**] and is of unknown
significance.

Brief Hospital Course:
He underwent L CEA on [**1-5**]. He was transferred to the floor in
stable condition. He developed chest pain on POD #1 and cardiac
enzymes were positive. Cardiac cath showed LM & 3VD and he was
admitted to the CCU. He was seen by cardiac surgery. He was
taken to the operating room on [**1-12**] where he underwent a CABG x
4 with LIMA-LAD, SVG-Diag and Y-OM, SVG-PDA, the bypass time was
87 minutes and crossclamp was 60 minutes. See OR report for full
details. He tolerated the operation well and he was transferred
to the ICU in critical but stable condition on propofol and neo.
He did well in the immediate post-op period and was extubated on
POD #1. He was also transferred to the floor on POD #1. He did
well postoperatively, his epicardial wires and chest tubes were
removed and he remained hemodynamically stable throughout this
period. His activity was advanced with the assistance of PT and
nursing. He did have some sternal drainage at lower pole and was
started on antibiotics. On post-op day seven it was decided he
was stable and ready for discharge home with VNA and the
appropriate follow-up appointments.
