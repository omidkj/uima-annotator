Attending Physicians:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], MD

ADDENDUM FOR [**2-20**] TO [**2119-2-24**]:  The plan on [**2-20**] was
that the patient would get a bed at [**Hospital1 **] for
ventilatory failure, a respiratory bed, when the bed was
available.  The bed was not available as planned on [**2-20**], and so the patient remained in the MICU with trach
collars overnight.  Continuing consults were obtained, and
follow-up through the nutrition team, as well as the [**Last Name (un) **]
team for maintenance of tube feeds, and recommendations for
both her Lantus and sliding scale insulin coverage.

The patient was seen again by case management.  The patient
was a little bit lethargic and responded only really when
spoken to.  Case management helped the family with new
referrals.  The patient was seen by the renal attending on
[**2-21**] also.  There was a note from the renal attending
on [**2-21**] describing the patient's grave prognosis and
minimal responsiveness.

The patient was seen continually by physical therapy and
occupational therapy for evaluation.  On [**2-21**], the
patient had completed dialysis the day prior, had been on
trach collar overnight, had a blood pressure in the range of
110-125 systolic/30-50 diastolic, with a temperature of 98.4,
sinus rhythm in the 80s, with an FIO2 of 50% on the vent with
the trach collar.  She was somewhat somnolent.  Her heart was
regular rate and rhythm with S1 and S2 sounds, in sinus
rhythm.  She had her PICC line and her tunneled catheter in
place for hemodialysis.  White count 10.1, hematocrit 33.1, K
3.7, BUN 38, creatinine 2.4, PT 12.2, INR 1.0.

The patient continued on antibiotic therapy.  Her mental
status did wax and wane at that time.  The patient continued
on antiseizure medication and continued with the trach collar
as tolerated.  Supportive care was given.  The patient
remained in the MICU under the care of pulmonary and critical
care medicine with a planned hemodialysis schedule for
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  The patient was out-of-bed to the
chair that day and continued to receive PT and OT.

The patient was followed also by plastic surgery for the flap
that had been done.  On [**2-22**], the patient had no events
overnight, answers questions yes or no with a squeeze of the
hands and was somewhat somnolent.  BUN rose to 63 with a
creatinine of 3.4.  White count was stable at 9.5.

The patient generally received supportive care over the next
couple of days, awaiting the rehab bed, as well as getting
her hemodialysis on the schedule indicated.  Please refer to
the renal attending note.  The patient continued to be
followed closely by case management.  Plastics monitored her
wound and flap, as well as the JP drain that was in place.
The patient was evaluated for Passy-Muir valve.  The speech
pathology team recommended an ENT consult prior to Passy-Muir
valve and determined that she was not a candidate for
Passy-Muir at that time.  JP output continued to be slow but
[**Last Name (LF) 4374**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the catheter was not placed at that time.

Renal attending noted a desire for another neurologic consult
at that time and a defined plan for the patient's care prior
to going out to rehab.  On postoperative day #18, the
patient's vital signs were stable.  The staples were removed
from the flap wound.  JP remained in place draining some
serosanguineous fluid with the plan to leave the JP drain in
place until the patient was ready to leave if drainage had
decreased.  The patient had some free water for electrolyte
correction on [**2-24**].  Creatinine was 3.3 on [**2-24**],
white count 9.8, hematocrit 34.1.  The patient did have a
little bit of worsening mental status on the 23.  The
patient, on exam, had minimal movement of the right hand but
slightly better than the left hand.  She blinks her eyes
episodically.  There was no neurologic progress being made at
this time.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was the renal attending who consulted who again
expressed desired to have a plan made about what is the
endpoint in terms of her function and her continuing renal
support.  The patient was seen again on [**2-24**] by case
management, and a bed became available at [**Hospital1 **].
