Service:  GENERAL SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48 year old
female with hypothyroidism who underwent routine laparoscopic
cholecystectomy on [**2167-10-8**], for symptomatic cholelithiasis
in [**Location (un) 3844**].  The patient was discharged on the same day
after the procedure and had some incisional pain for a few
days postoperative.  One week postsurgery, the patient had
sudden onset of left sided pleuritic chest pain with
shortness of breath.  She was seen in the office the next day
and was found also to have mildly elevated liver function
tests.  The patient presented to the Emergency Department on
[**2167-10-16**].  She had a positive VQ scan with high probability
for pulmonary embolism.  Ultrasound revealed mild dilatation
of biliary ducts and right hydronephrosis.  CT scan showed
marked dilation of intrahepatic biliary tree mostly on the
right side with minimally dilated extrahepatic ducts.  The
patient was started on Heparin drip for her pulmonary
embolism and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further evaluation and management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypothyroidism [**2167-7-13**].
2.  Cholelithiasis, status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy
[**2167-10-8**].
3.  Cesarean section.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Synthroid 50 mcg once daily.
2.  OCP.

ALLERGIES:  Ibuprofen makes heart race.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation, the patient is
pleasant and cooperative in mild distress. Temperature 98.1,
blood pressure 130/78, pulse 108, respiratory rate 20, oxygen
saturation 96% in room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Sclera
are nonicteric.  The neck is supple, no jugular venous
distention.  Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, split
S1 and S2, no murmurs.  Lungs revealed decreased breath
sounds at the bases bilaterally, clear to auscultation.  The
abdomen reveals multiple healing trocar sites, soft,
hyperactive bowel sounds, nondistended, mildly tender in the
epigastric area.  Extremities are warm and well perfused, no
edema, no tenderness.  Neurologically, the patient is alert
and oriented times three, nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  AST 709, ALT 1159, total bilirubin 3.4,
alkaline phosphatase 469.  White blood cell count 4.5,
D-dimer more than 1000.  Hematocrit 35.0, platelets 678,000.
Total protein 6.7, albumin 2.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was continued on Heparin drip.
She was taken to the Gastroenterology Suite on [**2167-10-22**],
where endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and MRCP
was performed.  The findings were previous cholecystectomy,
total obstruction of right main hepatic duct due to surgical
clips, normal pancreatic ducts.  There was also question of
left sided colonic thickening.  At this point, general
surgery consultation was obtained.  A decision was made to
quantify and minimize the risk of pulmonary embolism before
proceeding with hepatic interventions.

On [**2167-10-23**], the patient had lower extremity LENI looking for
deep vein thrombosis which was negative.  The patient had a
CTV of pelvic veins which also did not show any signs of
clot.  The patient had CTA which showed signs of resolving
pulmonary embolism at the bilateral bases.  Abdominal CT
showed dilated right sided ducts as well as thickening in the
descending colon starting at the splenic flexure.

At that point, the patient was transferred to the general
surgery team for further evaluation and management. On
hospital day three, the patient is afebrile and vital signs
stable.  She continues to have mild epigastric pain.  She
tolerates clear well, ambulates.

Hospital days number four and five, the patient is afebrile
and vital signs are stable.  Her liver function tests are
slowly coming down, however, still markedly elevated.  On
[**2167-10-26**], the patient's antibiotic coverage was switched from
Unasyn to Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  The patient had
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty done under
general anesthesia.  The procedure went without
complications.  The stent was placed and started draining
green brown clear bile.  Prior to the procedure, it was
discovered that the patient is probably allergic to Demerol
with reaction being chills.

On hospital day seven, the patient is afebrile and vital
signs are stable.  She was taken to Gastroenterology Suite
again for colonoscopy which found one small rectal polyp
which was removed and sent for pathology.  Overall,
colonoscopy was described as ? inflammatory bowel disease
versus ischemic changes.  No other masses were identified.
The patient continued to be on Heparin for her pulmonary
embolism.  She was also started on Coumadin.

On hospital day number nine, the patient is afebrile and
vital signs are stable.   She does not have any pain at rest.
She tolerates regular diet.  Her T tube is in place draining
clear green bile.  She is ambulating without problems.  The
patient was started on Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous twice a day
and at this point Heparin was stopped.

Anticipated discharge is [**2167-10-30**].  No other concerns and no
issues at this time.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged home with VNA
for Lovenox injection and education as well as T tube care
and teaching.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is scheduled for biliary repair
procedure on [**2167-11-10**].  The patient should call Dr.[**Name (NI) 9886**]
office in one week for full instructions.  The patient's
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 3175**], was also contact[**Name (NI) **] and
