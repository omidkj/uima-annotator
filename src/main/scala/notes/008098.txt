Service:  Transplant Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old
male with a history of congestive heart failure (with a
recent admission in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year), end-stage renal
disease, status post kidney transplant times two (once in
[**2156**] and once in [**2175**]), status post pancreas transplant in
[**2164**] who presented with a 4-day history of progressive
diffuse abdominal pain and occasional nausea.

The patient reports that prior to this episode he had been
feeling well, but he started to develop some crampy abdominal
pain followed by some dark watery stools over the past day
prior to admission.  He had been febrile with occasional
chills and had poor oral intake for several days prior to
admission.  He denied any chest pain, shortness of breath,
and any back pain.  The patient presented for evaluation.

Past medical history is significant for a kidney and pancreas
transplant in [**2156**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 469**] and a second kidney
transplant in [**2175**].  Also, the patient is disabled by his
congestive heart failure and dyspnea on exertion but denies
any history of liver disease.

ALLERGIES:  GENTAMICIN (which causes vertigo) and CODEINE
(which causes some stomach upset).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed temperature was 102.6, heart rate was 80, and blood
pressure was 130/70.  The patient was in mild distress.  He
had diffuse crackles halfway up the bases.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate with a 1/6 systolic
ejection murmur.  The abdomen was distended, tense, and
diffusely tender; but mostly tender in both lower quadrants.
There was no hernia.  Rectal examination was guaiac-negative
with normal tone.  Extremity examination revealed a left
femoral scar with a monophasic right posterior tibial
dopplerable signal.  No left posterior tibial dopplerable
signal.  No dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  He had 2+
femoral pulses bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed white blood cell count was 3.9, hematocrit
was 28, and platelets were 170.  Blood urea nitrogen was 64
and creatinine was 2.8.  Liver function tests were within
normal limits.  Urinalysis was negative.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computerized axial tomography
done on the night of admission showed bilateral pleural
effusions, large amounts of intra-abdominal ascites, and
colonic wall thickening in the ascending and transverse colon
and some of the proximal descending colon, but no evidence of
obstruction.

A chest x-ray was consistent with cardiomegaly and pulmonary
vasculature congestion.

Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rhythm with no ischemic
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Transplant
Surgery Service.

A Hepatology consultation was obtained secondary to the tense
ascites which was seen on the computerized axial tomography.
He was also started on empiric antibiotics for the diffuse
colonic thickening, though to be question colitis.

An ultrasound-guided paracentesis was performed, and this was
shown to be polymicrobial in the cultures.  He was started on
Zosyn and treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

Also on initial evaluation, based on examination and the
chest x-ray, there was evidence of worsening cardiac function
and congestive heart failure.  The patient was seen by the
Cardiology team who suggested continued diuresis with
intravenous Lasix.  They also suggested starting a Natrecor
drip for augmentation of his urine output and following daily
weights.  This was initiated as well to help in treatment.

By hospital day four, the cultures from the paracentesis had
shown multiple organisms.  At that point, the patient's
examination had significantly improved, and his white blood
cell count had risen to 12.

The decision was made to take the patient to the operating
room for an exploratory laparotomy.  Further details of this
surgery are detailed in the Operative Note.  In brief, there
was thickening of the descending colon seen and multiple
diverticula.  A sigmoid colectomy was performed.  A
transverse colostomy and a Hartmann's procedure were
completed.

Postoperatively, the patient recovered in the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  His hemodynamics were optimized via a
PA catheter.  Early in the postoperative course, the patient
required pressor support to maintain mean arterial pressures
of greater than 60.  This was successfully weaned over the
initial 24 hours postoperatively, and the patient's
hemodynamics then stabilized.  The patient was ruled out for
a myocardial infarction via enzymes.

The patient was initially kept intubated postoperatively.
Early on, he was weaned to pressure support and once sedation
was off the patient was following commands.  He was extubated
on postoperative day one without incident.  He has remained
extubated since that time.

The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition for
nutrition.  After several days postoperatively, the patient
was started on post pyloric trophic tube feeds which he
tolerated.  The ostomy began to function with gas and small
amounts of stool, and this was advanced accordingly while he
was in the Intensive Care Unit.

The patient's renal function remained stable.  His creatinine
remained around 1.8 to 2 with adequate urine output.  He was
maintained on a Natrecor drip to help with diuresis, and he
was also continued on the Lasix which was optimized using the
PA catheter to avoid intravascular volume depletion.

His blood sugars remained in good control; although he was
covered occasionally with a regular insulin sliding-scale.
The patient was continued on antibiotics postoperatively and
had occasional low-grade temperatures, but otherwise his
white blood cell count responded and decreased during the
postoperative course.

The patient's immunosuppression continued.  He was on
Solu-Medrol until adequate oral intake was achieved.  The
patient's sirolimus level was checked and adjusted
accordingly, and the patient was continued on CellCept with a
decrease in dose secondary to renal function.

On postoperative day 10, the patient was transferred to the
floor on a Natrecor drip and remained in stable condition.
The remainder of his hospital course was significant for the
following events.

On postoperative day 15, on examination the patient was found
to have tense ascites and some abdominal pain.  A
computerized axial tomography was performed which showed
tremendous amounts of ascites with decompressed bowel.  He
underwent an ultrasound-guided tap for 5 liters of ascites.
This was supplemented with intravenous colloid to maintain
intravascular volume.  He tolerated this well.

Then, on postop
