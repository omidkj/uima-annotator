RADIOLOGY:
=========
[**2163-10-8**] CXR : The ET tube is 2.8 cm above the carina. NG tube tip
is in the stomach. There continues to be volume loss/infiltrate
in the left lower lobe in the retrocardiac region. There are
also patchy areas of volume loss/infiltrate obscuring the right
hemidiaphragm and right heart border.
.
[**10-10**] CXR: 1. Retraction of endotracheal tube, now located 5.8 cm
above the carina. 2. Stable left lower lobe and right hilar
opacities, which may represent atelectasis or less likely
consolidation.
.
[**2163-10-13**]- Portable CXR: Acutely occurring left-sided total
pulmonary whiteout most likely related to mucous plugging and
atelectasis
.
[**10-21**] Head CT:  There is no evidence of an intracranial
hemorrhage.  There is no midline shift, mass effect or
hydrocephalus.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved.
.
[**10-27**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated.  The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
There is a large vegetation on the aortic valve (right cusp).
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-10-1**], findings are
similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, chronic PEs, PVD, AR/MR medically
treated, CHF p/w SIRS/sepsis from presumed line infection and
persistent mental status changes.
.
# SIRS/Sepsis: On admission presented with fever, hypotension
(SBP 60's), lactate of 3.3.  CXR showed an infiltrate in LLL, UA
shows many white cells, positive nitrites, < 1 epi, but UCx was
negative. Line infection was thought to be most likely
possibility. Line had been removed by patient at home.  She was
started on antibiotics with vanco/cefepime for presumed sepsis
and volume resucitated with NS IVF. Admitted to ICU, where she
was transiently placed on pressors.  A new dialysis catheter was
placed, in addition to a PICC to complete a 2 week course of
vanco/cefepime. She subsequently remained hemodynamically stable
and afebrile.  Blood cultures have been negative this entire
admission. Patient is afebrile with normal white count. SBP at
baseline low 90s to low 100's. C. diff and ova/parasites, RPR,
and sputum gram stain were negative.  Blood cultures have
remained negative.  Vancomycin and cefepime were given for a
14-day course.
.
# Mental status changes: During MICU course and after admission
to floor, patient was noted by staff and husband to have waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, most notably decreased attention and
perseverative/repetitive speech. Although she was oriented x 3,
she would repeat "the 20th" several times before being able to
move on the next question. Her mental status was observed for
several days to determine if there was any improvement, with the
thought that resolving infection may have been a factor. Other
possible etiologies included ischemia/hypoperfusion from poor
cardiac output or uremia from renal failure. Oversedation with
drugs was also considered--pain medications were held, trazodone
was d/c'ed. Hypothyroidism was considered as well, and
levothyroxine was increased from 25 -> 50 -> 100 mcg daily.
This should be checked in 2 weeks. Additionally head CT was done
that showed no abnormalities.  The patient had some improvement
in mental status, though not completely at baseline per husband.
 Pt was alert and oriented x 3 on day of discharge and
appropriate.
.
# ESRD on HD: Secondary to gentamicin-induced renal failure
during endocarditis admission. New HD catheter placed. Currently
on MWF HD schedule, although recommended 4x/weekly (as
