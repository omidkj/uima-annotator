Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
52 y/o M with PMHx of CHF (EF 20%), crack pneumonitis, COPD,
HTN, HLD, HCV, who is presenting with shortness of breath.
Reports that shortness of breath began 2-3 days ago and is worse
with exertion. Also endorses some intermittent orthopnea. During
this time, he has had a cough productive of white frothy sputum.
Endorses pleuritic chest pain but no heart palpitations.
Endorses chills, but no fevers or night sweats. No worsened LE
edema. He also endorses some nausea, heart palpitations,
lightheadedness, and headaches. He has had some sick contacts
recently.

In the ED, initial VS: 98.5 108 105/72 22. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN report, he was
tachypneic with an SaO2 of 88% on RA, 2LNC placed and SaO2
increased to 95%. Labs significant for BNP of 4905 (up from
prior values), Tn 0.03. CXR showed diffuse airspace opacities
c/w infection. EKG was c/w prior. He was given
vanc/levofloxacin, duonebs, 500 cc IVFs. Bedside echo by ED
reportedly showed no effusion, "plump" RV with no focal WMAs. VS
prior to transfer 98.4 70 25 102/54 97%2L.
On arrival to the floor, the patient reported that his breathing
was much improved.
Of note, pt was recently admitted with dyspnea in 3/[**2195**]. At
that time, it was felt that his symptoms were likely related to
fluid overload and hypersensitivity pneumonitis [**1-21**] crack
cocaine. He was diureses, his carvedilol was increased, and he
was started on a prednisone taper.

III) IMAGING:
Chest XRAY:
FINDINGS:

Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung
volumes. Diffuse bilateral consolidate opacities with have
recurred since prior exam, but are in different distribution.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size
is top normal.

IMPRESSION:
Diffuse bilateral consolidative opacities have recurred in
different
distribution since prior exams, likely due to interval
environmental
exposures.

V) PENDING AT DISCHARGE:
[**Month/Day/Year 3143**] CULTURES [**2196-4-11**]: Pending

Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old man with schizophrenia, multiple admissions for
inhaled freebase-cocaine pneumonitis, non-ischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%
who presented in the setting of volume overload secondary to
dietary indiscretions and was admitted for treatment of acute on
chronic systolic congestive heart failure.

# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure with a LVEF of 20%:
Upon arrival to the floor ~8am [**2196-4-11**], Mr. [**Known lastname 10794**] was in florid
heart failure. He had 2+ lower extremity edema. His JVD was
elevated to the angle of the mandible. He his respiratory rate
was in the low 30's, heavily labored with a saturation of 94% on
5L facemask. His pulmonary exam notable for diffuse inspiratory
rales. His BNP was elevated to 5000. He was given IV lasix 40mg
after which he made approximately 2L of urine. He was
re-evaluated two hours later and his clinically he appeared to
be as volume overloaded as before. He was given 80mg of IV lasix
and he made another 3L of urine. Despite brisk diureisis, his
respirations were labored with respiratory rates in the 30s and
oxygen saturation in the 90's on 6L facemask. At that time, he
noted left sided chest cramps. An EKG was performed which showed
no dynamic changes concerning for ischemia. His cardiac enzymes
were negative. Due to concern for impending respiratory failure
secondary to volume overload, he was transferred to the medical
ICU for overnight monitoring. In the ICU he received additional
lasix, but did not require mechanical ventilation. The following
day, the patient returned to the floor breathing comfortably on
4L NC. He was actively diuresed with IV lasix to 193 lbs from an
admission weight of 201 lbs. He responded very well to the
diuretics and upon discharge had an ambulatory saturation in the
mid 90's on room air, no JVD, and no lower extremity edema. Of
note during diuresis his carvedilol was decreased to 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **]
from 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] secondary to [**Hospital1 **] pressures in the high 90s.
The patient
was counseled extensively on the importance of a low sodium diet
after the patient admitted to eating foods high in salt like
ramen and BBQ.

Chronic Issues:

#Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:
Pulmonary function testing from 4 months ago show that Mr. [**Known lastname 10794**]
has an FEV1 ~50% predicted and a FVC ~65% predicted. These
values are suggestive of both a component of restrictive and
obstructive lung disease. Given his previou
