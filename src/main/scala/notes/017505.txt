Brief Hospital Course:
1. Shortness of Breath: The differential diagnosis originally
included MI, CHF exacerbation, pneumonia, PE.  He was started on
a nitro drip and given Lasix 80mg IV in the ED and was brought
to the floor.  His oxygenation improved, and by morning he was
oxygenating well on room air.  He did not complain of further
shortness of breath.  A follow up CXR showed improvement.  An
ECHO was performed and the final [**Location (un) 1131**] was pending at
discharge.  Because is cardiac enzymes had been elevated,
including CK-MB and Troponin, and his EKG showed ST changes, and
because of his significant cardiac history, he was also given
ASA and started on a heparin drip.  We had wanted to perfrom a
cardiac catheterization, but the patient refused.  He claimed he
did not need such a test.  The cardiology fellow explained the
test, risks and benefits, and that we thought it would be wise
to have.  After hearing the risks and benefits of the test, the
patient still refused.  His cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] also spoke
with the patient, trying to convince him to stay in the CCU for
catheterization.  The patient refused.  His PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
also [**Last Name (STitle) 653**] and was to visit him in the CCU that day.  The
patient left AMA before his PCP could arrive.  His PCP was
[**Name (NI) 653**].  Further work up for his SOB could not be performed.
Upon leaving AMA, the patient did not complain of any symptoms.
In addition to his outpatient medications, the patient was
written prescriptions for Metoprolol, Atorvastatin, and Lasix
40mg PO qDay.  he was also told to take aspirin.
.
2. Hypertension: On admission the patient's BP was in the 200s
systolic.  The patient responded well to the nitro drip,
metoprolol, and lasix.  His BP returned to the 110-120 systolic.
 He did not experience any symptoms.  Upon leaving AMA, the
patient's BP was stable off of the nitro drip.  Further work up
could not be performed, but he was advised to follow up with his
cardiologist and PCP immediately to address his blood pressure.
.
3. Lymphocytosis: The patient had an elevated count on
admission.  However, the patient was afebrile and did not have
any localizing symptoms.  He was given a dose Levaquin in the
ED.  Blood and urine cultures were sent.  However, the patient
left AMA before further work up could be performed.  Cultures
were still pending at the time of leaving AMA.
.
4. Disposition:  The patient left AMA despite being urged to
stay.  We told him that we were concerned about his heart, and
that we would want perform a cardiac catheterization to assess
his heart disease.  The patient was decribed the consequences of
leaving and the risks/benefits of staying, including suffering a
heart attack or other acute event if he did not stay, and he
understood the risks and benefits.  He was urged to follow up
with his PCP and cardiologist within a week.  He was urged to
return to the hospital with any symptoms.  He was also given
prescriptions for his medications and urged to take them
consistently and as prescribed.  His blood and urine cultures
will need to be followed up, as well as his blood pressure and
respiratory symptoms.
