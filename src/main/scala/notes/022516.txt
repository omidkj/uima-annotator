Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness and fatigue x1 wk.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular Tachycardia ablation
Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
66yo man with hx of afib s/p pacer (no AICD), CAD. DMII, short
gut syndrome who presents with fatigue and weakness since
wednesday.  He noted onset of fatigue and bilateral palmar
paresthesias on Wednesday.  This was not assoc with any fevers,
chills, SOB, chest pain, or palpitations.  His sx persisted
daily and he had worsened exercise tolerance, reporting
difficulty ambulating up three flights of stairs at home.  Last
night he felt much increasing weakness and fatigue.  He awoke at
3am with these complaints.  His wife tried taking his BP without
any success.  She reports that his pulse was "weak and flighty."

.
In the ED, SBP 89/56, HR 160.  EKG showed wide complex
tachycardia.  Received amio 150mg IV bolus at 11:07am.  Pt
became unresponsive at 11:09 so received 200J biphasic
cardioversion.  He returned to HR of 70 and was V-paced.  SBP
then 70s-80s.  Has two 18g PIVs and received 2L IVF.  Amio gtt
stopped given persistently low BPs.  Lidocaine gtt started at
1mg/min to help prevent recurrent VT.  BP remained low so periph
neo started at 0.5 mcg/kg/m.  Neo increased to 1 mcg/kg/m with
SBP to 90.  Right IJ CVL placed by ED.  Labs returned just prior
to transfer and pt was noted to have WBC 35, HCO3 9, and Anion
Gap of 18.
.
Currently, he denies any localizing symptoms: no F/C/NS, URI
like sx, cough, abd pain, change in bowels, skin rashes, or
urinary complaints.  He does describe chronic low back pain.
Slightly increased DOE but no CP, no PND, no orthopnea, no
increased edema.


Past Medical History:
- diabetes mellitus II; last A1c 5.7
- CAD: no CABG or stent placement.  C cath report below.
- Afib: originally treated with amio but then underwent AV node
ablation and placement of pacer approx 5 yrs ago.

--right BKA
polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **]
Debilitating neuropathic pain
non-healing anal fissure, s/p surgery [**8-1**]

Ext: right BKA.  Left foot cool with nonpalp pulses.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.


Pertinent Results:
EKG [**2130-11-25**] Wide complex regular tachycardia consistent with
ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular rate is about 170. Compared
to tracing of [**2130-8-15**] ventricular tachycardia is new. Of note,
patient was previously ventricularly paced. Clinical correlation
is suggested.

EKG [**2130-11-27**] Demand ventricular pacing with ventricular premature
depolarizations and underlying atrial fibrillation. Compared to
previous tracing of [**2130-11-26**] increased ventricular ectopy is now
noted. Otherwise, no major change.

PLEURAL FLUID- LEFT THORACENTESIS- GRAM STAIN NEGATIVE, CULTURE
PENDING UPON DISCHARGE, SENT FOR CYTOLOGY, PENDING UPON
DISCHARGE, SENT FOR CHEMISTRIES WHICH REVEAL THIS AS A
TRANSUDATIVE EFFUSION BY LIGHTS CRITERIA.

LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY [**12-1**]:
1. No evidence of DVT.
2. Non-occlusive thrombus involving the left median antecubital
vein, not part of the deep venous system.
3. Left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.

[**12-5**] CHEST X RAY S/P THORACENTESIS ON LEFT:
In comparison with the study of [**12-4**], there has been removal of
a
substantial amount of pleural fluid on the right.  Specifically,
no evidence of pneumothorax.  The left lung remains clear.

ECHO [**11-27**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with inferior/infero-lateral akinesis
(basal to mid infero-lateral wall thinned c/w with prior
infarct/scar). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. No masses or vegetations are seen on the pulmonic
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. There is a small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2129-4-28**], the pericardial effusion is new. Otherwise, no
significant change.
