[**2148-1-10**] Head CT : Acute subdural hemorrhage overlying the left
temporal lobe extending to overly the left frontal lobe, with
some effacement of the left temporal lobe. No significant
midline shift.

[**2148-1-10**] CT C spine :

1. No evidence of acute fracture.
2. Multilevel degenerative disease. Minimal anterolisthesis of
C5 over C6.  If continued clinical concern for spinal cord or
ligamentous injury, MRI is more sensitive.
3. 5 mm right upper lobe nodular density. Follow up chest CT is
indicated in [**7-21**] months if patient is high risk (incl history
of smoking or malignancy) or in 12 months if patient is low
risk.
4. Mild septal thickening in visualized portions of bilateral
lung apices, may be due to mild edema.

[**2148-1-10**] Left hip fracture : Subcapital fracture of the proximal
left femur.

[**2148-1-10**] CT Torso :
1. Multiple pulmonary nodules stable since [**2142**]. Largest
preexisting nodule, in the right upper lobe, is smaller and
retracted, consistent with scar.
 2. New left anterior third rib fracture.
 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions probably due and mild
pulmonary edema.,
 4. Concurrent conventional PA and Lateral upright radiographs
recommended to evaluate possible right lower lobe lesion
(rounded atelectasis or abscess, less likely tumor) or fissural
fluid loculation. If the abnormality is verified it can be
followed with subsequent conventional films.
  5. Possible pulmonary arterial hypertension.
  6. Calcification of the coronary arteries, aortic valve and
aorta extending into the brachiocephalic trunk.

[**2148-1-10**] Head CT : 1. Small left subdural hematoma, unchanged in
size. Subdural blood layers along the falx and tentorium.
2. Right frontal hyperdensity which is equivocal for a small
focus of
subarachnoid hemorrhage and can be reassessed on followup
studies (2:23).
  NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is not evidence of
subdural hemorrhage along the falx or tentorium. These
structures are dense due to enhancement from prior
administration of contrast material for the abdominal CT study.
Otherwise I agree with this interpretation.

[**2148-1-11**] Head CT : 1. Little change in the 3 mm left subdural
hematoma.
2. Right frontal lobe hyperdensity is no longer identified.
3. Possible subtle hypodensity of the left temporal lobe. If
there is
concern for acute or subacute infarct, MRI is recommended.

[**2148-1-12**] Head CT : 1. Unchanged 4-mm left subdural hematoma.
2. 2-mm hyperdense focus in the left frontal lobe equivocal for
small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Attenation to this
finding is recommended on follow-up studies.
3. Unchanged left temporal lobe hypodensity can be due to
contusion. If
there is concern for acute infarct, MRI is recommended.

[**2148-1-13**] MRI Brain : No acute infarct identified. The CT
demonstrated hypodensity in the left temporal region likely is
secondary to artifacts as well as some associated changes of
brain contusion and extra-axial blood. A small left- sided
subdural is again identified. Severe changes of small vessel
disease and moderate ventriculomegaly and sulcal prominence due
to atrophy is identified.

[**2148-1-16**] EEG: no seizure activity

[**2148-1-17**] Non invasive carotid studies : No significant stenoses
bilat. ICA's












Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated in the Emergency Room by the Trauma
Service and all scans were reviewed. Based on her small SDH she
was transferred to the Trauma ICU for close monitoring and
frequent neuro checks. Her admission INR of 2.5 was corrected
with 2 units of fresh frozen plasma which normalized her INR
along with some Vitamin K.  Following a temperature spike of 101
she was fully cultured. She remained stable and on [**2148-1-11**] was
taken to the Operating Room for repair of her left hip fracture
and placement of an IVC filter.  She tolerated this well and
subsequently underwent repeat Head CT's which showed no
progression of the SDH.  She was transferred to the Trauma floor
for further management. She was transfused with 2 units of
packed red blood cells post op for a hematocrit of 24.

Forty eight hours after an unchanged Head CT she began
anticoagulation with Heparin for her mechanical valve and atrial
fibrillation.  About 3-4 hours after the heparin started she
developed left sided weakness and seemed more somnolent.  She
also had rapid atrial fibrillation.  This prompted transfer back
to the ICU.  A repeat head CT showed no increase in the SDH and
she was seen by the Stroke service for full evaluation.  An MRI
of the head was recommended and showed no acute stroke, a stable
SDH and small vessel disease.  The hypodense area at the left
temporal lobe was artifact.  Her mental status continued to wax
and wane between sleepy to alert and conversant. ( Her primary
language is Polish but she can speak and understand a little
English.) Her left sided weakness resolved and she was improving
daily.  Carotid studies were negative and an EEG showed no
