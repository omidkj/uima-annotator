History of Present Illness:
This 62 year old diabetic male with a prior history of CAD, s/p
MI and CABG x3 at [**Hospital1 2177**] in [**2112**] (graft anatomy not available), s/p
primary prevention ICD in [**4-/2114**] which was revised in [**1-/2115**]
when he became pace maker dependent [**2-2**] atrial fibrillation and
tachy-brady syndrome, presented yesterday to [**Hospital3 29691**] with dyspnea. He reports air hunger on laying flat last
night before bed, which was new, although he does endorse DOE
over the past 2 weeks.
.
He denies dietary indiscretion, although his family says
"sometimes" he eats some salty foods." He has not had any chest
pains. He does not report any PND or orthopnea prior to last
night. He does not have ankle swelling. Further denies
palpitations, syncope, or presyncope.
.
At the OSH, he was tachycardic to 120s, atrial tachycardia
alternating with sinus rhythm, with pacing spikes before each
QRS. He was placed on bipap and diuresed with lasix IV, but
could not be weaned off bipap. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

.

.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. He does report
productive cough for the past month, which had actually been
improving. All of the other review of systems were negative.

TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction including near akinesis of the distal half of the
ventricle. The basal inferior and inferolaterl walls contract
best. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle,
though apical views area suboptimal. The estimated cardiac index
is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Significant aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be estimated.
There is a small pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity dilation with extensive
regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Diastolic
dysfunction. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.

Persantine-MIBI:
1. Severe, fixed apical and apical-inferior wall, and moderate,
fixed inferior wall perfusion defects. 2. Diffuse LV
hypokinesis, cavity
dilation and depressed EF of 28%.

CXR: The patient is status post median sternotomy. Multiple
surgical clips are reflective of underlying surgical history of
CABG. An implantable cardiac defibrillator device project of the
left upper chest with leads unchanged in position. An adjacent
radiopaque object obscures detailed evaluation of the left upper
and mid lung field. The cardiac size is overall top-to-mildly
enlarged. There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and
evidence of peribronchial cuffing. There is no evidence of
alveolar edema, particularly at the lung bases. No definite
pleural effusions are seen.

IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with mild to moderate congestive
heart failure

Brief Hospital Course:
# CAD/Ischemia: The patient had slightly elevated troponins
likely secondary to  demand ischemia from CHF with elevated
LVEDP and tachycardia. Repeat cardiac enzymes were negative,
making ACS much less likely. He was evaluated with a
persantine-MIBI prior to discharge which showed no fixed
defects. His was continued on a beta blocker but it was changed
to Toprol for easier dosing. He was also begun and an aspirin
daily and continued on his home dose of a statin. He was also
begun on a low dose ACE for better afterload reduction. His dose
of Imdur was also increased. He will follow up with his
outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], in [**7-11**] days.
.
# Pump: The patient presented volume overloaded with dyspnea,
hypoxia requiring positive pressure ventilation, and pulmonary
edema on CXR. In discussion with the patient, he had apparently
been eating salted bologna recently. This dietary indiscretion
was likely the cause of his fluid retention.  An echocardiogram
confirmed an unchanged EF of ~25% no new wall motion
abnormalities. The patient was aggressively diuresed with IV
Lasix initially with good response. He became 5-6 L negative
over the course of his admission. He was rapidly removed from
positive pressure ventilation and his oxygen requirement
decreased to room air by HD 2. His Imdur was increased for
preload reduction and he was begun on an ACE inhibitor for
better afterload reduction. He was transitioned to his home dose
of Lasix and maintained a negative fluid balance. An aldosterone
antagonist, such as s
