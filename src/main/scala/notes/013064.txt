Chief Complaint:
fever and respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old demented latvian-speaking woman who lives
at [**Hospital **] Healthcare Center. On [**12-21**], she was noted to have
cough, wheezing, hoarseness, and temp of 101.4. She was started
on levaquin, flagyl, and nebulizers for possible aspiration
pneumonia. She had a fever to 100.9 the next day. On [**12-23**], her
creatinine was noted to be up to 1.3 from 0.7 with poor PO
intake. On [**12-24**], she had another temp to 101.4 was more short of
breath with respiratory distress. She received nebs and tylenol,
and was transferred the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

In the ED, she was noted to be in respiratory disress, satting
99% on a nonrebreather. She was given nebulizers and put on
noninvasive mask ventilation. She had a temp of 99.8 but stable
blood pressure. She was given 750 mg levofloxacin, 1 gram of
ceftazadime. She was given PR aspirin for a slightly elevated CK
and troponin. She weaned from mask ventilation and put on 2L NC,
but admitted to the MICU for close observation.

[**2134-12-25**] 3:34 am Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture
      Source: Nasopharyngeal aspirate.

   Rapid Respiratory Viral Antigen Test (Final [**2134-12-25**]):
      Respiratory viral antigens not detected.
      CULTURE CONFIRMATION PENDING.
      SPECIMEN SCREENED FOR: ADENO,PARAINFLUENZA 1,2,3 INFLUENZA
A,B AND
      RSV.
      This kit is not FDA approved for direct detection of
parainfluenza
      virus in specimens; interpret parainfluenza results with
caution.

   VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far

Blood cultures - no growth.
ECHO:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls and distal
septum and apex. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF
= 35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to
moderate ([**1-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal cavity size with
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel
CAD. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Thickened mitral and
aortic valves but without discrete vegetation identified.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2134**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

CHEST RADIOGRAPH

Comparison to [**2134-12-25**]. The preexisting radiographic
alterations are unchanged, no newly appeared alterations.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged radiographic appearance as compared to
[**2134-12-25**].

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2134-12-25**]  1:25:20 AM


Sinus rhythm. Right axis deviation. SI-Q3-T3 pattern. Low
njormal voltage in
limb and precordial leads. Right bundle-branch block. Compared
to the previous
tracing of [**2134-12-24**] no significant change.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -76 BY SAME PHYSICIAN

Reason: ? CHF

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with pna, o2 req, now inc wheeze
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? CHF
Chest radiograph comparison to [**2134-12-25**], at 5:58 a.m.
The radiographic appearance is virtually unchanged. Both lungs
show relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15410**] opacities with air bronchograms. The
opacities show no major progression. Slight bilateral pleural
effusions that are limited to the costophrenic sinuses. No newly
appeared lung opacities. Slightly enlarged cardiac silhouettes
with aortic calcification.

IMPRESSION: No relevant progression of the preexisting
intrathoracic process.

FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: This examination is limited. There is
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and possible left
retrocardiac opacity. Perihilar haziness and increased
interstitial markings likely represent an element of pulmonary
edema. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. More
confluent alveolar opacity in the right upper lobe likely
represents superimposed infection. There is diffuse osteopenia.

IMPRESSION: Mild CHF and likely superimposed right upper and
left lower lobe pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hypoxia, dyspnea was likely an combination of acute on chronic
systolic heart failure and bilobar pneumonia. Influenza and
respiratory viral cultures negative. Treated with antibiotics,
nebulizers, oxygen, aggressive pulmonary care with improvement.
Also diuresed for CHF. The patient's overall clinical condition
improved and she was discharged to NH to complete a total of 10
day course of antibiotics - levofloxacin. Lasix, lisinopril and
atenolol were continued
