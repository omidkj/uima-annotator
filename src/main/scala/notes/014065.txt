Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
85 yo F HTN, CAD, s/p MI, PAF, RUE DVT (on lovenox), CVA, h/o c
diff, recurrent UTIs, and trached/peg who presents from nursing
home with desaturation to 78% and w/ a MRSA bacteremia and
pseudomona/Ecoli UTI.
.
Per son and health aide, patient doing okay since last
hospitalization for UTI/anemia.  She was interactive, beginning
to speak, until over the past week and a half patient became
less interactive, developed fevers to 101.  She was cultured and
per report had 5+ blood cx for MRSA and Urine cx pos for
ecoli/pseudomona.  She was started on vanc [**9-25**] and ceftaz
[**10-19**].  She has had chronic diarrhea for the past 3 weeks.  She
also has required a chronic foley and is unable to void on her
own.  This AM per rehab patient desated today to 78% and
appeared "pale, gasping" on vent at RR 10 FiO2 25%.  En route
per EMS patient brady'd, though no documentation of this.
.
Of note, in recent hospitalizations ([**Date range (1) 107552**]) patient
developed sepsis/hypoNa, c/b hypercarbic resp failure requiring
intubation.  Neuro consulted for her decreased respiratory
drive, felt possibly central process due to a pontine lesion and
ultimately pt was trached/peg.  She was also treated w/
vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP, vanc/flagyl for c diff, and
lovenox for RUE dvt.  She was readmitted ([**Date range (1) 62927**]) for
anemia (hct 20) transfused 1u pRBC, and treated for a UTI.
.
In the ED her VS were HR 82, BP 96/53, 18, 98%.  On exam she had
coarse rhonchi and [**Location (un) **].  FIO2 was increased to 100% and ABG
following was 7.40/36/233.  Her Na was 120, lactate 4, WBC 25,
hct 27.6. CXR w/ fluid overload vs multifocal pna.  She received
1L NS, and was continued on vanc/ceftaz.
.
On the ICU, she is intubated and follows some commands.

IMAGING

[**2178-10-23**]:
CXR
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities, bilateral
pleural
effusions of unchanged extent. Extensive retrocardiac
atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly. Unchanged position of the
tracheostomy tube.

[**2178-10-22**]:
ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Mild to
moderate ([**12-20**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate posterior
leaflet mitral valve prolapse. There is a large (2.1 x 1.1 cm)
mobile oblong mass on the atrial side of the mitral valve,
attaching to the mitral annulus, adjacent to a band of dense
annular calcification (MAC). Additional, thinner mobile
echodensities are seen on the ventricular side of the mitral
valve in the apical 4-chamber view. At least moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Large mitral valve mass, as described above. At
least moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension. While the mass may be
consistent with caseating degeneration of dense MAC or a valve
tumor, the timing of its appearance (by comparison to the study
from a month ago) together with the provided clinical setting
makes this much more likely to be either a pure vegetation or
mixed mobile calcification/vegetation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-8-25**], the
mobile mitral mass is new and precludes more detailed evaluation
of the valve morphology - e.g., MVP was better appreciated on
the prior study. Severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
The other findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Sepsis/SIRS: Patient with leukocytosis, infection, and
elevated lactate.  Per rehab known sources include MRSA
Bacteremia (5+ blood cx and was started on vanc [**10-5**]).  She
also has been having diarrhea and w/ a h/o c diff, would be
concerned for c diff now.  Her CXR here is concerning for
infectious process as well.  Currently her SBPs have been
110s-120s and HR low 100s.  Pt had known bacteremia and UTI and
repeat ECHO revealed a large vegetation on her mitral valve.
The patient remained stable during the first few days of her ICU
stay however, she began to decline rapidly secondary to her
underlying sepsis despite adequate and proper medical
management.  There were multiple family meetings during the
patient's stay in the ICU and they understood the severity of
her disease and her poor prognosis.  It was ultimately decided
to make the patient CMO and she was terminally extubated.
