Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7539**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for acute CHF exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
63 y/o man with PMH of DMII, COPD, CKD/ESRD on HD, 3VD s/p RCA
stent ([**5-13**]). Admitted to OSH with resp distress, intubated and
noted to have elev tropI and CKs. Pt developed acute dyspnea and
nausea while watching TV with his family late PM on [**6-25**]. Denied
CP per notes. Intubated in OSH ED. Peak myoglobin > 1000,
Troponin I 0.74.
.
Recently admitted to OSH ([**6-16**]) with CHF exac from dietary
indiscretion which family says has been continuing issue.
.
Upon admission, decision was made not to take for immediate
intervention given his questionable NSTEMI and known anatomy.
Cards to consider intervention on Monday.


Past Medical History:
1. CAD- known 3VD with 90% RCA s/p DES, 70% ulcerated LMCA
lesion, pt and CT [**Doctor First Name **] declined CABG ([**5-13**]) [**3-11**] co-morbidities
(ICA disease, ESRD)
Cath [**2190-6-3**] = Right dominant circulation. LMCA was short and
heavily calcified with a distal taper. LAD proximal eccentric
80% lesion and the distal vessel had a tubular 70% lesion.
Numerous diagonal arteries were without critical lesions. LCx =
non-dominant vessel with heavy calcifications. Only a ramus was
seen and it was occluded proximally. RCA = dominant vessel with
a proximal 99% lesion. The abdominal aorta was found to have
moderate diffuse disease with iliac aneurysmal dilation and poor
distal flow to the CFA. The RCA was stented with a 3.0 x 18
Cypher. The final residual was 0% with normal flow.
2. DMII
3. ESRD on HD- Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
4. COPD
5. Hypertension
6. s/p CVA, b/l ICA occlusion
7. s/p ccy


Social History:
Pt is separated from his wife. [**Name (NI) **] has not worked for the past
three years but used to be employed as a salesman. He has an 80
pack year tobacco history and smokes 2.5 packs per day. ? EtOH
use. Denies IV drug use.

Family History:
He is unsure of what diseases run in his family.  He reports
that his parents had "all the big diseases."  His brother had an
aneurysm.  He reports that his sister has inner ear troubles.

ECG: sinus tachy at 100, nl axis, 1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] depr V3-V6, I, L
(old, v3-v6 improved)
.
Imaging:
CXR = no signif pulm edema/infiltrates, lines and tubes ok
.
ECHO:  EF 45-50%  The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with nmore prominent
hypertrophy of the basal septum, but no resting LVOT gradient.
Normal cavity size with hypokinesis of the basal half of the
inferior wall. The remaining segments contract well. Tissue
velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal
left ventricular filling pressure. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:63 yo male with 3VD s/p RCA DES ([**5-13**]) p/w acute pulm edema
at OSH and ?NSTEMI.
.
#) CAD: known 3VD, not CABG candidate; recent RCA DES, 80% LAD
lesion, diffuse LCx disease, now with ?NSTEMI
-- rx with ASA, plavix, high dose statin, beta blocker, hep gtt,

-- NO GIIbIIIa (given ESRD)
-- cycle CKs, follow EKGs
-- to more urgent cath if hemodynamics worsen, STE develop...
.
#) Pump:
-- recent TTE with EF 40-45%, mild sLVH, mild global HK, mildly
dilated LA; repeat TTE in 48hrs
-- volume o/l noted at OSH and here BNP > 54,000
-- will consider PA cath if hemodynamics change
.
#) Rhythm:
-- NSR, follow EKGs
.
#) Resp failure:
-- likely related to acute pulm edema from ?ischemic event,
volume o/l from inadequate HD
-- will try to wean vent as tolerated
-- pt with known COPD, tolerate elev pCO2 (approx 55)
-- c/w ATC combivent MDI
.
#) ESRD on HD:
- Getting HD TTHSat; had HD on [**6-26**] at OSH.
- c/w EPO, hold phoslo for now
- Renal following
.
#) Fever:  Could be COPD exacerbation/bronchitis vs. UTI vs.
inflammation (s/p MI, pulm edema, etc.)
- Sputum, blood and urine cx
- CXR clear
- Will trend fever curve and CXR and exam and assess WBCs in am.
 Consider Azithromycin for acute exacerbation of COPD
.
#) s/p CVA: b/l 100% ICA stenosis
-- monitor neuro status, c/w ASA, plavix, statin for [**3-11**]
prevention
.
#) COPD:
-- ATC MDI as above
-- bl pCO2 near 55 based on HCO3
.
#) DM 2:
-- RISS, hold oral hypoglycemics
.
#) FEN:
-- NPO for now, start TF if intervention not planned for > 24hrs
.
#) Dispo: Full Code.
