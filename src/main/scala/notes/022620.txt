[**5-13**] - EKG Probable ectopic atrial rhythm. Borderline right axis
deviation with modest right ventricular conduction delay.
Diffuse non-specific T wave flattening. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2173-12-23**] ectopic atrial rhythm is new.
.
Imaging:
[**5-17**] ECHO - IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of endocarditis in
the setting of structurally thickened valves. Moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Diastolic dysfunction. Mild
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Mild aortic
stenosis. Moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of [**2173-12-24**], the LVOT gradient has decreased. Aortic
regurgitation has increased.

[**5-19**] CT IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of intra-abdominal or
intrapelvic source of infection. 2. Cholelithiasis without
evidence of cholecystitis. 3. Sub-4-mm pleural-based pulmonary
nodules in the right lower lobe.
.
[**5-18**] ultrasound right arm - Findings consistent with a
predominantly thrombosed pseudoaneurysm of the mid
graft as above.
.
[**5-23**] - tagged WBC scan - IMPRESSION: No abnormal foci of tracer
uptake.


Brief Hospital Course:
Impression and plan: 65 yo F w/ MMP incld ESRD s/p renal tx. on
HD (MWF), DM, CHF, CAD presents 1 day after discharge after
having been found to have +MSSA blood cultures.  Now on
Cefazolin dosed at dialysis and is s/p cefazolin desensitization
in the MICU.

1. Bacteremia
- blood cultures negative since [**2174-5-18**]; requires total of 6
weeks of antibiotics
- Prior antibiotics Vanco [**Date range (1) 12079**], x1 [**5-25**] Nafcillin [**Date range (1) 12080**],
Cefazolin 1g IV with HD (1.5g on Fridays) ([**5-26**]-
- as of [**5-25**]- on Cefazolin so that it can be dosed at dialysis as
outpatient: final ID recs are Cefazolin 1 gram M/W and 1.5 gram
on Frdiay
- tagged WBC scan today without specific foci of uptake
- CT of abdomen with contrast showed no acute or infectious
process.
-TEE not tolerated by patient and will not be further pursued
(would require general anesthesia)so cannot rule out bacterial
endocarditis as potential source therefore will treat for full
course 6 weeks
- pt will not need graft removed as tagged wbc scan does not
show evidence of overwhelming uptake in that region
- history of cefazolin allergy s/p desensitization, had +
swelling over left eye [**5-26**] concerning for reaction , however
swelling has improved and patient has received furthur dosing
today.
- if pt tolerates antibiotic today would consider d/c tomorrow,
will require home visiting nurses services
- also if stable tomorrow, can remove EJ before discharge

2. ESRD: The patient is s/p cadaveric renal transplant in [**2168**]
back on HD.
-on Tacrolimus, Bactrim DS, prednisone, nephrocaps, and
cinacalcet, continue dialysis
.
3. Type 2 Diabetes:
-Pt sometimes hypoglycemic after dialysis.
-pt frequently hypoglycemic during this hospital stay, holding
half of NPH dose
.
4. Chronic Diastolic CHF:
- Currently euvolemic, fluid management as per dialysis,
continue ACEI/BB, on [**Year (4 digits) **], statin, b-blocker
.
5. CAD: Continue on [**Year (4 digits) **], statin, beta-blocker, ACE-I.
6. Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin.
7. Anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease: H/H is 11/34
-continue epogen during HD and outpt PO iron.
8. Diahrrea: pt with profuse water bowel movements
- stool negative x3 for c. diff, so likely non-infectious, will
reccomend outpatient symptomatic treatment, increasing fiber in
diet etc
