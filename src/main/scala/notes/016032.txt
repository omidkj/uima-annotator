Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was initially admitted after a code stroke was called.
She arrived from an OSH intubated. Her daughter had noted her to
be somnolent and non-responsive at home.

She was admitted to the neuro-ICU. She was found to have a large
left MCA ischemic stroke with ICA occlusion. Family was told
about her prognosis, but wished to wait to withdraw care until
her husband could visit (he was an inpatient at [**Hospital1 2025**]). Family
decided on [**2190-12-14**] that they would like to move towards comfort
measures only and have her extubated.

She had developed several infections, including a staph
pneumonia and c. diff colitis and was on Cefepime, Vancomycin,
Flagyl and Fluconazole, but continued to spike low-grade temps
and had rising leukocytosis. Antibiotics were withdrawn on
[**2190-12-14**].

Patient was made CMO during family meeting with palliative care,
ICU, and neurology present. She was made comfortable and died at
1:50 pm on [**2190-12-15**].
