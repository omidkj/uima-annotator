History of Present Illness:
88 year old female with multiple medical problems including
dementia, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and A.Fib on
coumadin presents with one week of generalized weakness and not
feeling well. Pt also c/o vague abdominal discomfort and, today,
nausea and anorexia.

In ED noted to have an inflamed wrist joint - this was tapped
and there was no evidence of infection. Wrist films showed a
wrist fracture and she was placed in a splint. On further
history-taking the pt does recall falling on the right hand "a
couple of weeks ago". She was also noted to have elevated LFTs
and an abdominal CT and ultrasound showed choledocholitiasis
without acute cholecystitis. The studies were not changed since
[**2181-12-8**]. She received a dose of Zosyn in the ED as
"empiric therapy for presumed intra-abdominal pathology". She
was seen by Surgery in the ED, and no surgical problems were
identified. GI Consultation was suggested.

Was last admitted here from [**2182-7-5**] through [**2182-7-7**] for mental
status changes, which were thought to be due to Ultram +/-
Detrol (both were stopped) in the setting of probable [**Last Name (un) 309**] body
dementia.

ROS: denies SOB, chest pain, bowel or bladder problems,
currently denies abdominal pain or nausea. Asks for a drink of
water. Pain in right wrist region is tolerable. All other
systems negative.

[**2182-8-2**] Wrist XRAY
RIGHT WRIST, FOUR VIEWS: There is a fracture of the distal
radius with
minimal distraction of a 4-mm fragment. There is mild positive
ulnar variance.
There is extensive soft tissue edema. There is an amorphous
density in the
region of the triangular fibrocartilage which may indicate
chondrocalcinosis. There is degenerative change of the first CMC
and triscaphe joints.
IMPRESSION: Distal radius fracture with mild positive ulnar
variance.

[**2182-8-5**] ERCP Report
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was
injected resulting in complete opacification.
Two regular stones ranging in size from 4mm to 6mm were seen at
the biliary tree.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
The stones were extracted successfully using a balloon.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

[**2182-8-8**] EGD
The biliary sphincterotomy was identified and appeared normal.
No bleeding was noted. No ulceration or erythema was noted. The
sphincterotomy was observed for about 5 minutes - no bleeding
was noted.
Impression: Polyp in the stomach body Erythema and friability in
the antrum
No fresh or old blood was found in the stomach or duodenum. The
biliary sphincterotomy was identified and appeared normal. No
bleeding was noted. No ulceration or erythema was noted. The
sphincterotomy was observed for about 5 minutes - no bleeding
was noted. Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: No source for melena was found.
Give Vit K and FFPs to keep INR < 1.5.

[**2182-8-12**] Colonoscopy
Large amount of stool was found in the whole colon. About 33% -
50% of the colonic mucosa was obscured by stool.
Protruding Lesions A single sessile 10 mm polyp of benign
appearance was found in the cecum. This involved the appendiceal
orifice. Given patient's co-morbidities and poor bowel prep this
was not removed.  Impression: Polyp in the cecum - this was not
removed. Poor bowel preparation
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

[**2183-8-14**] Transesophageal Echo
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
thickened/deformed. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen. Significant
aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
There is moderate-to-severe (3+) tricuspid regurgitation.

IMPRESSION: No definite vegetations identified; thickened and
calcified aortic valve leaflets, with aortic stenosis present
(not quantified).

[**8-16**] MRI C - T - L Spine
IMPRESSION:
1. Markedly limited examination with no obvious findings to
suggest vertebral body/disk/epidural infection.
2. Interval increase in size of extramedullary intradural soft
tissue mass at the C7-T1 interspace, resulting in rightward cord
deviations/mass effect. The lesion is most likely a meningioma.
If alteration in care will occur, can consider repeat dedicated
target imaging through this region once patient is able to
tolerate exam.

3. Mild anterior wedge compression deformity involving T5 which
appears new from [**2174**] exam but not acute. Additional multilevel
cervical and lumbar spondylosis is not significantly changed.

[**8-17**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal appearance to the spleen.
2. Air and contrast in the gallbladder and left biliary system
related to
prior sphincterectomy and ERCP. No pericholecystic fluid or
inflammatory
changes to suggest cholecystitis.
3. Focal stranding of the right pannicular fat may represent
asymetric edema or panniculitis .
4. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectatic changes.

[**8-19**] CT Head w/o contrast:
Study severely limited by motion artifact. A contrast-enhanced
MRI, or
contrast
