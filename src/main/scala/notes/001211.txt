Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
right shoulder - pain- RUL lung tumor for excision s/p
chemotherapy and radiation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right posterior and lateral thoracotomy, right upper
    lobectomy with en bloc chest wall resection of ribs 2 and
    3.
2.  Right cervical incision with scalene fat pad and lymph
    node resection as well as mobilization of superior sulcus
    tumor off of 1st rib and division of the 2nd rib
    anteriorly.
3.  Thoracic lymphadenectomy.
4.  Flexible bronchoscopy.


History of Present Illness:
62-year-old woman who developed right shoulder pain and was
found to have a large right upper lobe tumor invading into the
2nd and 3rd ribs and abutting up against the 1st rib. She
underwent cervical mediastinoscopy as well as peripheral
metastatic workup. There were no positive lymph nodes and no
metastasis. She underwent induction of chemoradiotherapy to
shrink the tumor away from the subclavian artery and subclavian
vein as well as the brachial plexus. She has been restaged and
was found to have excellent response. We, therefore, took her
forward for a resection of the superior sulcus tumor. Our plan
was to biopsy the scalene fat pad and lymph nodes and if there
is no evidence of tumor to move on to mobilize the superior
sulcus tumor from the cervical incision, including division of
ribs as necessary. We would then move on to a posterolateral
thoracotomy for completion of the procedure.

Past Medical History:
Gastric esophogeal reflux disease, Coronary artery disease,
diabetes type 2, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Non
small cell lung cancer s/p chemotherapy and radiation.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2171-10-24**] 11:29 AM
Reason: eval for PTX
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old woman with lung CA post CT pull
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for PTX
HISTORY: 62-year-old woman with lung cancer status post surgical
resection. Please evaluate for pneumothorax.

TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained and
compared to [**2171-10-22**].

FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of two right apical
chest tubes. No definite pneumothorax identified. There are
post-surgical changes at the right apex including signs of
volume loss of the right hemithorax with persistent elevation of
the right hemidiaphragm and mediastinal shift to the right.
Again noted are multiple surgical rib defects at the right apex.
The right lung base and the left lung are grossly clear. Heart
size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable given differences
and patient rotation.

IMPRESSION: Interval removal of right apical pleural drains. No
definite pneumothorax. Surgical changes at the right apex with
associated volume loss of the right hemithorax.


Brief Hospital Course:

RUL. Pain control w/ epidrual is at T6/T7 14/5. She is split
receiving both bupivicaine .1% thru epidural and dilaudid PCA
because she has a wide incision on multiple dermatomes and a
neck incision. She was supported w/ low dose neo while on
epidural. Briefly intubated in ICU and, successfully extubated.
