   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2175-11-21**]):
      REPORTED BY PHONE TO M. MAL [**2175-11-21**] @8:07 AM.
      CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
         FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
         Reference Range:  Negative.
         A positive result in a recently treated patient is of
uncertain
         significance unless the patient is currently
symptomatic
         (relapse).

Operative report [**11-12**]:
Perforated sigmoid diverticulitis
with intraabdominal contamination.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, sigmoid
colectomy and transverse loop colostomy.

CT scan [**11-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Please note that
evaluation of small branches in lower lobes are somewhat limited
due to quantum mottle and atelectasis.
2. Severe centrilobular emphysema with peribronchial opacities,
pulmonary edema, and bilateral small effusion and atelectasis.
Enlarged main pulmonary artery.
3. Probable tracheobronchomalacia.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which can be reactive.
5. Multiple small hypodense lesions in the liver, too small to
characterize.
6. Gallstones.
7. 1-cm right renal lesion, of indeterminate appearance on this
one-phase CT. Further characterization by dedicated MRI or CT
scan is recommended on non- urgent basis.
8. Changed appearance of the bowel in this patient with recent
sigmoidectomy.

Head CT scan [**11-21**]:
CONCLUSION:
No evidence of hemorrhage. No mass effect. Opacified ethmoid
sinus.

Chest X-Ray [**2175-11-27**]:
FINDINGS: Since the prior study, the patient has been extubated
and there is a right CVL with the tip in the SVC and no PTX.
There is no focal consolidation; the left CP angle is cutoff
from view. There is continued demonstration of right pleural
thickening, unchanged from the previous study. Pulmonary
vascular markings are within normal limits. Previously seen area
of increased density in left upper lung zone is not seen on the
current film.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic explanation for the patient's
dyspnea

EKG [**2175-11-27**]:
Baseline artifact
Sinus rhythm
Probable left atrial abnormality

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate given his co
morbidities and the initial plan was to admit him to the SICU
for monitoring and to treat his diverticulitis with IV
antibiotics of ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl, and bowel
rest.  [**Last Name (un) **]-rectal surgery was consulted to provide
recommendations on management and concurred with the decision to
manage the patient non-operatively.  Serial exams were performed
on the patient and he continued not to display any peritoneal
signs.  On hospital day #2, conservative management was
continued.  However, the patient's abdomen became firmly
distended and became larger throughout the course of the day.  A
