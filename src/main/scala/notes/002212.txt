History of Present Illness:
HPI: 74yo F w/hx of COPD, depression, anxiety, recent cellulitis
presented to PCP today for medical concerns of cellulitis.  Pt
had last been seen on [**2165-8-12**] during which time she had
bilateral leg cellulitis and hypoxia (78% on 2L nc). It was
recommended that she be admitted and pt refused.  Was prescribed
Keflex with VNA services. Later refused VNA visits and canceled
future appointments.  When seen in [**Hospital 191**] clinic today. She was
hypoxic 70% on 2L and cyanotic; she was agreeable to
hospitalization.
.
In ED; The patient was started on Vanc and Zosyn. CTA showed no
PE but a focal linear density in the aorta concerning for
dissection vs small mural thrombus.  Vascular and CT surgery
consulted thought that the patient likely had a mural thrombus,
that no surgery would be performed and that medical managment
was appropriate. EKG showed J-point elevation in anterior leads,
? STEMI, cards reviewed EKG and thought there might be some
ischemic changes but that no intervention was necessary. The
patient was given steroids and continuous nebs. As her ABG did
not improve, she was placed on CPAP. She continued to fatigue
and had rising pCO2. She was then intubated and admitted to the
MICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 19376**] was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure
in the setting of COPD, continued smoking and possible pneumonia
seen on CXR.  CTA was negative for PE, but showed possible mural
thrombus.  Medical managment was recommended.  Echocardiogram
did not show new heart failure.  She was put on standing nebs,
Solumedrol 125mg IV q8 hours, Levofloxacin for PNA and
Vancomycin for her cellulitis.  She was transitioned to Unasyn
on [**2165-9-30**] after sputum and blood cultures were negative.  Her
respiratory status improved and she was extubated on [**2165-10-1**].
She was then transitioned to PO Augmentin and should complete a
14 day course. (Last day of abx = [**2165-10-10**]). She was diuresed
with IV Lasix and then put on Lasix 20mg PO qday which should be
continued after discharge for edema and heart failure.
Theophylline was held due to concerns for drug interactions.
Her legionella antigen was negative and sputum cultures were
negative.
.
For her cellulitis, wound care evaluated Ms. [**Known lastname 19376**] and
recommendations are below.  She continued on antibiotics and was
given Lasix to remove fluid.  She was negative 5 liters over the
course of her MICU stay.
.
On [**2165-10-2**], she was complaining of chest pressure which she
related to heartburn.  ECG was done and was negative for any
changes suggestive of ischemia.  She had cardiac enzymes which
were negative X 1.
.
After extubation, she did well was changed to PO Prednisone 40mg
a day.  She will then be tapered over 2 weeks.  She has a 4L
oxygen requirement and saturations range between 87-92% at
baseline.  She is appropriately compensated and stable within
this range.

Glargine 8 units at night as well as a sliding scale insulin.
