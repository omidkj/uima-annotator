Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) placed.


History of Present Illness:
38 M with 2V CABG [**5-30**], BiV pacer, dilated CM, CHF EF 20-25%
[**8-1**], p/w CP and NSVT, now with stable VS, CP-free.
Pt reports that fifteen minutes after participating in sexual
activity at ~3am, patient acquired a chest pain that ran across
both sides of his chest, with a predomination toward the right
side, with subsequent radiation down his right arm. The pain was
constant and was not resolving, which prompted a call to EMS.
Patient is unsure if the pain resolved, and even how, admits to
continued pain to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] degree. Associated with the pain was a
period of diaphoresis. Patient states that he has had "6 heart
attacks" in the past and each had a different type of pain, and
this pain is not exactly like the others. He does admit to a
chronic, left-sided pain that is there "all-the-time" without
resolution that is worse when he breathes.
Other ROS is essentially negative, except for shortness of
breath, which he states is chronic for him and his CHF. He also
admits to an insiduous, intermittent visual clouding that began
six months ago. He is passing his urine and bowels well, denying
dysuria, hematuria, hematochezia. States he is mostly compliant
with his medications but admits to missing a few doses as he
dislikes medications.
In the ED,EKG NSR, no PVCs. Short runs of VT but hemo stable and
no syncope per EMS, no EKGs, no strips, but VT stopped on lido
gtt from OSH. Transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital, where he
had just been admitted for CHF exac. In ED, on heparin gtt, lido
gtt from OSH continued here, nitro gtt, plavix, was given ASA at
OSH. Pt did not take am meds this am, but has been compliant. Pt
was told about "ripped mitral valve" and ?MVR per pt told to him
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**] (outpt attg). He was
told he would have mitral valve surgery after dentition surgery
later this month, but hasn't been scheduled yet. Goes to [**Hospital 6451**], [**Hospital3 5097**], [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Last hospitalization [**2148-8-11**] - worsening shortness of breath x
1-2 days, CP x 2 days, cough and LE edema x 1 day. The patient
originally presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital, where EKG
showed frequent PVCs and telemetry showed runs of VT < 10 beats,
given lidocaine. Admitted at [**Hospital1 **] for admitted for moderately
decompensated CHF and rest angina. On telemetry throughout his
stay he was noted to have numerous PVCs and a number of episodes
of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (5-10 beats). Had I&D
of superficial abscess on right lower abdomen, +MRSA, completed
14 days of Bactrim. DC plan for medical management, started on
digoxin.
.
Last CATH [**2147-9-14**] - 3VD, occluded SVG-RPDA, patent LIMA-LAD.
Last ECHO [**2148-8-12**]: Apical LV aneurysm, 1+MR, 1+TR. No EP report
on when BiV pacer was placed.


Past Medical History:
2V CABG (question of CABG x2): SVG-RPDA occluded [**8-31**], LIMA-LAD
patent
CHF EF 20-25% in [**8-1**]
Dilated cardiomyopathy
HTN
Hyperlipidemia
BiV pacemaker - unsure of installation


Social History:
He is divorced and has one daughter. [**Name (NI) **] spent two months in
prison secondary to domestic abuse charges. He quit smoking
after his CABG. He does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. He
does not work and is on disability. His mother is very ill and
has hospice services. She is his main source of support.

SKIN: numerous psoriatic-like scaly patches on upper anterior
torso and bilaterally on lower extremities around knees and
shins. Healing I&D wound on right lower quadrant, mild erythema.

fundoscopy. Preserved sensation throughout. 5/5 strength
throughout. [**1-29**]+ reflexes, equal BL. Normal coordination. Gait
assessment deferred
PSYCH: Listens and responds to questions appropriately, pleasant



Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2148-10-13**]:
1. Cardiomegaly. Status post sternotomy. Pacemaker present.
2. Prominent hila, which raises the question of pulmonary
hypertension. The lungs are hyperinflated, which may indicate
COPD.
3. Mild upper zone redistribution and increased perihilar
interstitial markings. This could represent early CHF.
4. Small (approximately 12 mm) opacities in the right suprahilar
region. These may be related to the acute process about the hila
and are in areas where bones, vessels, and oxygen tubing are
overlapping. However, repeat PA and lateral views when the
patient is stable is recommended to further assess this area.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Chest pain - Patient had risk factors for active acute
coronary syndrome, but he had no EKG changes and his cardiac
enzymes were negative. He had a p-MIBI to further evaluate his
myocardial perfusion which showed significant, fixed, diffuse
perfusion defects but no reversible changes and no new changes
from prior.  He was therefore, not a candidate for further
investigation by catheterization.  He was continued on aspirin
and plavix.  His metoprolol and lisinopril were increased over
the course of his hospitalization.  He complained of a vague
chest discomfort throughout the course of his hospitalization
which was worked up with EKGs without acute changes.  However,
he had no further chest pain episodes similar to the complaints
he had on initial persentation. The patient's lisinopril was
discontinued for a period of several days after a creatinine
elevation. Hydralazine 10mg Q6h was used during this time to
improve forward flow. Prior to discharge (after improvement in
Cr toward baseline) the patient was switched back onto
lisinopril and hydralazine was discontinued. The patient was
without chest pain for 48 hours prior to discharge.
.
# Ventricular arrhythmia - Patient had a history of 23 seconds
of Ventricular tachycardia associated with syncope in [**2146**]. He
also had NSVT by report on transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] and continued to
have occasional episodes of asymptomatic NSVT on telemetry
during his hospitalization. The patient has decreased systolic
dysfunction, CAD, and a history of VTach so he was seen as an
excellent candidate for ICD placement. Patient had refused ICD
placement in the past but was amenable to placement this
admission.  However, given his extremely poor dentition, he
required tooth extractions prior to proceding with the ICD
placemen
