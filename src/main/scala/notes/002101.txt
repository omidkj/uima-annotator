Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12174**]
Chief Complaint:
Admit for elective portal venogram/thrombectomy and attempted
TIPS procedure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transcutaneous Intrahepatic Porto-Systemic Shunt Placement
1) Portal venogram
2) Attempted TIPS procedure


History of Present Illness:
57 y/o M with hx EtOH cirrhosis, portal hypertension and
gastroesophageal varices who presents for evaluation of portal
vein thrombectomy or TIPS placement. The patient has had a 14-15
yr history of liver disease in the setting of heavy drinking
(8-9 beers daily) since teenage. He has been completely
abstinent of EtOH since his diagnosis (14-15 years). He has had
a 5 yr hx of ascites, and reports recent acceleration of ascites
accumulation, with SOB being a prominent symptom of the
accumulated ascites. His SOB resolves upon a therapeutic
paracentesis; most recent paracentesis performed at [**Hospital1 **] [**12-2**] removed 4L fluid. On CT [**2135-12-14**] his known main
portal vein thrombus x 10 years was found to have extended into
L portal and splenic veins. He also has gastroesophageal varices
with hx of bleeding which presented as dehydration and
lightheadedness with no melena/hematochezia/hematemesis; last
major bleed in [**2125**] with ICU admission but no recent bleeding
episodes, last banded by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15532**] ([**Hospital3 **])
summer [**2134**].

ROS: Denies any jaundice, confusion or mental status changes,
myoclonus, melena, hematochezia, hematemesis, dysuria,
hematuria. Reports one episode of emesis and lightheadedness
this morning due to "anxiety" before leaving for the hospital.

[**2136-1-24**] Portal Venogram Prelim report:
Portal venogram demonstrated the portal vein was completely
occluded with a collateral vein connecting the splenic vein to
the right and the left portal veins. This collateral vein is in
good size and with no pressure gradient drop from the splenic
vein to the collateral and further to the left and right portal
veins. No clots were visualized inside the collateral vein a
highpressure was measured inside the collateral vein, which was
36mmHg. A TIPS procedure should be evaluated for the patient.

[**2136-1-26**] TIPS procedure Preliminary provisional report:
1. Unsuccessful TIPS procedure. The patient's systolic blood
pressure
dropped into the mid 70s and due to two capsular perforations
and this being an elective case, the procedure was terminated.
2. 3 liters of bloody ascites fluid removed.

[**2136-1-26**] Abd/Pelvis CT:
1. Ascites, slightly increased in comparison to [**2135-12-14**], with
contrast layering dependently related to attempted TIPS
placement. 2. No active extravasation seen on post-contrast
imaging. 3. Unchanged cirrhosis and portal hypertension. 4.
Extrahepatic and probable intrahepatic locules of gas associated
with the  posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver. 5.
Splenic, superior mesenteric and portal venous thrombosis is
better evaluated on the previous CT.




Brief Hospital Course:
57 y/o M with hx EtOH cirrhosis, portal hypertension and
gastroesophageal varices s/p portal venogram with unsuccessful
thrombectomy [**2136-1-24**], s/p attempted TIPS complicated by bleeding
and hypotension [**2136-1-26**].
.
Patient was initially admitted after elective portal venogram
and evaluation for thrombectomy of portal vein thrombus on [**1-24**].
This was unsuccessful, however, 1.7L ascites was removed.
Patient was then admitted for observation awaiting elective TIPS
eval and procedure on [**1-26**].
.
On [**1-25**], his hematocrit was found to drop from a preop baseline
of 30 to a low of 22; he remained asymptomatic without
lightheadedness, tachycardia or significant hypotension. He then
received 2U PRBCs [**1-25**] pm, which increased his Hct to 29-30 the
next day.
.
On [**1-26**], he was taken by Interventional Radiology for a elective
TIPS eval/placement. For detailed report by IR see Pertinent
Results. Roughly 3 L of bloody ascites was removed prior to the
procedure. Briefly, during the procedure contrast was observed
to extravasate along the track/tract made during the prior
procedure on [**1-25**]; up to 5 passes were made in an attempt to
place TIPS device, but this was complicated by repeated bouts of
hypotension to SBP of 90s and finally 70s. At this point the
procedure was aborted; the patient was started on a low
continuous dose of neosynephrine and transferred to the MICU for
observation and management.  Surgery was consulted. CT [**2136-1-26**]
did not show evidence of a active bleed around the liver or in
the abdomen.
.
Per the IR team notes online, contrast injection revealed
extrahepatic pooling lateral to liver likely from transhepatic
access. In addition, the IR team speculates that there is likely
a second capsular perforation inferiorly from one of today's
passes. RA pressure were noted to be 16 mmHg without an IVC
gradient.

MICU Course:
[**2136-1-26**]: The patient developed SBPs to the 70s during failed TIPS
procedure. He was given 2 units of PRBCs prior during the
procedure and in the PACU, intubated, and placed on
neosynephrine. After intubation and on proprofol drip, SBPs were
in 100s on low dose neo. In the ICU, Propofol/neo were weaned.
Antihypertensives and diuretics were held and hematocrit was
monitored closely. His Hct stabilized at 30, and remained stable
throughout HD2. As propofol was weaned, the patient awoke and
self-extubated overnight. His respiratory status was stable
throughout the day post-extubation. His pressures improved
