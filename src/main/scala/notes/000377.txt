                            **FINAL REPORT [**2118-1-8**]**

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2118-1-8**]):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood
cultures
         positive for Staphylococcus aureus and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] species.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

                              SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in
MCG/ML

[**2118-1-5**] 10:11 pm MRSA SCREEN      Source: Nasal swab.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2118-1-7**]**

   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2118-1-7**]):
      POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.

[**2118-1-6**] 4:03 pm CATHETER TIP-IV      Source: Left femoral HD
line.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2118-1-8**]**

   WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2118-1-8**]):    No significant growth.

[**2118-1-5**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lobe opacity, similar to the prior examinations;
however, new pneumonia or underlying pulmonary lesion cannot be
excluded. Recommend
follow-up to resolution after appropriate treatment. Small right
pleural
effusion.
2. Slightly more cranial position of a femoral catheter with its
tip in the right atrium.

[**2118-1-6**] ECHO:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior
septum, inferior and inferolateral segments. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-9-6**],
pulmonary artery pressures can be estimated on the current study
and are mildly elevated. The wall motion abnormalities and other
findings are similar.

[**2118-1-6**] FEMORAL ULTRASOUND:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pseudoaneurysm, or fluid collections. There is an enlarged
lymph node within the right groin.
2. Clotted AV graft within the right leg, present on prior CT
examination.

[**2118-1-6**]
IMPRESSION:
Successful removal of a tunneled right common femoral
hemodialysis catheter. The tip was sent for culture.

[**2118-1-11**]
PFI: Successful placement of non-tunneled left femoral
hemodialysis catheter, with tip in the IVC, 24 cm in length,
ready to use. After resolution of hyperkalemia, the patient
should return to interventional radiology for conversion to a
tunneled line.


Brief Hospital Course:
59M with ESRD on HD with tunnelled femoral line, recent
prolonged hospital admission with MSSA bacteremia and lung
abscesses, presents w/ fever and hypotension later found to be
[**1-25**] MSSA.
.
# Hypotension: Patient initially admitted to MICU with
significant hypotension, but resolved upon arrival after
receiving IVF boluses.  The most likely etiology of his
hypotension was bacteremia.  He grew [**3-27**] sets of positive blood
cultures of MSSA on arrival.  His hypotension resolved quickly.
He maintained his blood pressures throughout his
hospitalization. He never required pressors during his MICU
course.
.
# Bacteremia: Patient was initially febrile and hypotensive.  He
was found to have 4 sets of MSSA positive blood cultures.  The
most likely sourc
