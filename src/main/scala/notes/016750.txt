Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
74F with history of hypertension presented to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with
one day history of acute onset shortness of breath. She first
noticed shortness of breath while walking up the stairs on
Monday. She presented to her PCP who drew [**Name Initial (PRE) **] D-dimer that was
elevated. She was sent to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  In the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she
was tachycardiac to 120s and had hypoxemia to high 80s improving
to low 90s on NC. ECG showed "strain" in V2 and V3 and TWI in V2
and V3. Bedside ECHO showed RV dilitation. She was given 1 mg/kg
lovenox SQ empirically. CTA showed extensive bilateral segmental
pulmonary embolism with no saddle embolism.

Of note, she denies past medical history of cancer, estrogen
usage, known hypercoagulability, recent travel.  No family
history fo clotting disorders.

Labs were significant for troponin 0.3 and BNP 515. The patient
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ICU admission.  In the ED, initial
VS were: 97.8 110 151/110 20 98% 4L. cTropnT 0.10, lactate 2.3,
BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 961**].  Heparin infusion was started, and lovenox was
discontinued.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient had no complaints or
concerns.  In the MICU she was continued on heparin infusion and
started on coumadin today.

Currently patient reports mild sob but denies any chest pain,

TTE: [**2108-10-11**]
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 75%). Doppler
parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular free
wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: findings are consistent with hemodynamically
significant pulmonary embolism with severe right ventricular
dysfunction

Brief Hospital Course:
74F with history of hypertension who presented with shortness of
breath and found to have bilateral submassive pulmonary embolism
with right heart strain.
.
# Submassive Pulmonary embolism: Patient initially presented to
PCP's office with acute shortness of breath and tachycardia and
found to have elevated d-dimer; sent to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where CTA
showed bilateral pulmonary embolisms along with RV strain on EKG
and on echo but hemodynamically stable.  She was given one dose
of Lovenox and  transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU service. Repeat TTE
showed severe RV dysfunction but she remained hemodynamically
stable therefore she did not undergo thrombolytic or surgical
embolectomy.  She was transferred to regular medical floor with
IV heparin.  She was transitioned to Lovenox injections [**Hospital1 **]
dosing and started on Coumadin  On the medical floor patient
complained of shortness of breath on exertion but denied any
chest pain, or shortness of breath.  One day prior to discharge
she was weaned off of oxygen and had sats in mid 90s.  She was
also evaluated by physical therapy and had ambulatory sats
ranging 89-92.  On the day of discharge patient's INR was 2.2.
She will have her next INR checked at PCP's office on [**10-16**].  If
her INR remains therapeutic then her PCP will discontinue
lovenox injections.  Patient has no obvious risk factors for PE
such as stasis, recent surgery/trauma, or hypercoagulable state.
Given her age, it is suspicious that she might have an
underlying malignancy or other secondary process causing
bilateral PE. Patient's PCP will decide to initiate further work
up to screen for coagulopathies that could have caused patient's
pulmonary embolism including a screening colonoscopy for colon
cancer. Per patient she is also about to undergo skin biospy by
dermatologist for suspicious skin lesions.
.
# CKD: Likely secondary to her HTN. Baseline Cr from [**2098**] is
1-1.2 at [**Hospital1 **] records (estimated eGFR 44) with admission Cr
1.2.  Her discharged Cr of 0.9.
.
# Hypertension: Patient was hypertensive to 180s one day after
admission in the setting of not received her home hypertensive
medications.  She was started on her regular home medications
Triameterene-HCTZ and amlodipine and her blood pressures dropped
to 140s.

Transitions of Care:
- Patient will follow up with PCP on tuesday [**10-16**] at
11am.  Patient will also have her INR checked on tuesday and her
coumadin dose will be adjusted based on her INR.  Her lovenox
injections will be discontinued if INR remains therapeutic. PCP
will initiate [**Name9 (PRE) 8019**] for
