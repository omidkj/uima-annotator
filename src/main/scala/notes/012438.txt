History of Present Illness:
77 y.o. paraplegic woman, who presents from rehab with delta MS.
She has been hospitalized/in rehab since [**2134-12-14**] when she was
ped struck by a minivan sustaining multiple injuries including
T6 fx (now paraplegic), pelvis fx , open tib/fib, clavicle,
hemopneumothorax.
.
The patient was noted to have a white count of 14.9 on [**1-17**]. On
[**1-19**] she had a T max of 99.5 and WBC of 12.2; she was started on
Vanc/Zosyn. She was noted to have altered mental status on [**1-20**]
and [**1-21**]. Ceftriaxone was added empirically [**1-21**]. She was
agitated and pulled out her gastrostomy tube on [**1-21**]. She was
transferred to OSH ED for g tube replacement on [**1-22**].
OSH ED: She was noted to have ?purulent discharge from her
G-tube site, in addition to drainage coming from her external
fixators of her lower extremities. CT at [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] showed
irregular fluid collection ant/inf to her fixated pubic
symphysis concerning for abd abscess. There was also evidence of
a possible left pathologic sacroiliac joint fracture. She was
given Vanc/Cipro. She was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for ICU
admission and further workup.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED: Initial vitals: 98.3, 88, 138/71, 13, 100%. Surgery
was consulted; abd fluid collection drained at bedside (counts
c/w seroma). Ortho consulted, rec continued abx and several
radiologic studies. CXR showed ?PNA. She was given flagyl and
cefepime and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

2. Moderate interstitial edema.

4. Right subclavian catheter in place, though the tip is not
clearly
visualized due to overlying hardware. If there is concern about
tip location, a lateral view is recommended.
.
[**2135-1-22**] pelvis X-Ray IMPRESSION: Very limited study with no
definite sacral fracture. If there is continued clinical
concern, CT of the pelvis is recommended for better evaluation.

TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) BILAT  [**2135-1-25**] 3:12 PM

Four radiographs of the left leg demonstrate comminuted
fractures of the tibial and fibular diaphyses. An external
fixator spans the tibial fracture. Very limited assessment of
the knee and ankle joints is grossly unremarkable. There is a
minimally displaced fracture involving the proximal head and
neck of the fibula as well. No lucency is seen about the
external fixator pins. There is evidence of calcific or metallic
density in the soft tissues along the anterior midline of the
distal leg. Finding is of uncertain significance. Retained
foreign body is not excluded.

IMPRESSION:

Tibia and fibular fractures as described.

Calcific/metallic density in the soft tissues along the anterior
midline of the distal right leg. A retained radiopaque foreign
body is not excluded. Clinical correlation is requested.
