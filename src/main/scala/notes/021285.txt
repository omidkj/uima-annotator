Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
   [**Age over 90 **]F non-verbal with dementia  and NH resident who p/w several
days of hypoxia, fevers, and cough.  Pt was started on
levofloxacin and clindamycin for presumed aspiration PNA and
klebsiella UTI at NH 2 days ago.  Pt also received lasix 20 mg
po qd x 2 days for presumed CHF decompensation.  Pt was found to
be hypoxic at 89% on NRB and tachypnic to 38.  Pt received lasix
40mg iv x 1 and ntg paste and was x-ferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

   In [**Name (NI) **], pt was febrile to 102 and tachypnic to 30's with SaO2
of 95% on 5L NC.  Pt was also found to have lactate of 2.5 with
WBC 16 and no bands.  ABG in ED showed the following:
7.46/37/78.  Pt received Levo, flagyl and Vanco prior to
receiving Blood Cx.  CXR was without obvious infiltrates and KUB
showed no dilated loops of bowel.  Later sensitivities from NH,
showed the Klebsiella to be Resistant to levo and cipro, but
Sensitive to Cefriaxone.  The patient subsequently got
Cefriaxone 1 g IV x 1. Patient also placed on levophed gtt. In
addition, the patient also went into afib with RVR at 170's,
which was subsequently slowed down to a ventricular rate of 120s
w/ IV Dilt.  Pt developed Troponin of 1.2 w/ nl CK in setting of
RVR, suggesting this was most likley demand ischemia.  Pt also
was found to have a sodium of 160 (hypovolemic hyperNa.

Patient was then admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Patient subsequently
switched from levophed to vasopressin and dobutamine, with
disscontuation of pressors on [**12-14**] and had improvement of
oxygenation. Antibiotics therapy was changed from ceftriaxone
and Zosyn to Unasyn. Culture data from [**Hospital1 18**] remains negative to
date. Patient did have recurrent episode of Afib with RVR that
was treated with diltiazem, while on dobutamine, with no further
episodes while off B-agonists.

At time of transfer, patient remains non-verbal.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo demented female NH resident admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with sepsis
protocol.

1. Sepsis: Most likely urosepsis, as patient admitted with UTI
and had no other evident source of infection (pt data from NH
showing Klebsiella sensitive to ceftriaxone).  Patient initially
treated with ceftriaxone, then Unasyn, given concern of
concomitant pneumonia and then to Augmentin once patient
tolerating pos.
Patient was weaned off of pressors and was stable
hemodynamically and afebrile for over 72 hours prior to
discharge.  She is to take Augmentin through [**2196-12-25**], to
complete a 2-week course of antibiotics.

2. Hypoxia: Likely [**2-29**] to increasd work of breathing and then
atelectasis or fluid overload.  Patient was titrated down from
Non-rebreather to oxygen supplementation via O2 nasal canula.
Her oxygenation remains stable on 2L and [**12-18**] has been stable
on room air.  Please follow RA sats, may require low level of
oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain O2 sat>92%.

3. Glucose control: Patient initiated on insulin in setting of
sepsis, with continued elevations in glucose. Patient was
started on QID FS and insulin sliding scale.  However, patients
finger stick glucoses were well controlled and she required no
insulin for several days prior to discharge.

4. Hypernatremia:  It is unclear how long the pt has been
hypernatremic and therefore was treated as though it had been
chronic. Peak sodium of 162 on admission, and was thought to be
secondary to dehydration.  She was given D5W with resolution of
her hypernatremia, though patients sodium returned from a low of
146 [**12-16**] to 150 [**12-17**], and was given an additional 2 liters of
D5W.  Serum Na was 143 on [**12-18**].  Given what appears to be
chronic hypernatremia presumably from dehydration, patients
serum sodium and hydration status should be followed
post-discharge, but should not be aggressively treated as pt
tolerates mild hypernatremia.

5.  Afib: Pt with episode of rapid ventricular response while in
ED which resolved with diltiazem and IV diltiazem PRN with
adequate control. Patient continued to experience paroxysmal
AFib while on floor and was initiated on low dose beta-blocker.
She thereafter converted back to normal sinus rhythm.  The
patients daughter and Health care proxy, [**Name (NI) 16405**] [**Name (NI) 349**]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 16406**]) would like to discuss with the patient's primary
care physician possible initiation of coumadin for long-term
stroke prophylaxis, pending resolution of acute issues.

6.  Demand ischemia/coronary artery disease: Patient noted to
have dynamic ischemic EKG changes in setting of Atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and urosepsis. With
clinical improvement, patient's cardiac enzymes downtrending
(from CK maximum of 191 to 81, CK-MB maximum 4, Troponin T
maxiumum 1.20). Patient continued on ASA and beta-blocker.

7. hypokalemia - patient noted on several occasions to have
hypokalemia, with minimum serum potassium 3.2.  Potassium was
repleted as needed.

8. Prolonged Qt/Qtc interval - Has been noted to have prolonged
Qtc interval previously, and likely secondary to hypokalemia and
hypomagnesemia.  Electrolytes repleted as above.  Patient was
maintained on telemetry for much of her hospitalization, notable
only for occasional ectopy and inter
