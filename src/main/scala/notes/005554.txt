CXR (admission)
ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:
The lungs are hyperexpanded but clear.  The cardiomediastinal
silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  No pleural effusion
or pneumothorax is present.
IMPRESSION: Hyperexpanded lungs, but no acute intrathoracic
process.
.
No additional laboratory testing performed

Brief Hospital Course:
67yo female with a long history of smoking and COPD who presents
with symptoms consistent with a COPD exacerbation.

#) COPD exacerbation: Patient presented with symptoms consistent
with COPD exacerbation. CXR clear without evidence of pneumonia.
There was no evidence of volume overload on exam and her
troponin was negative x 1. She did not have any refractory
hypoxia, leg swelling or history consistent with pulmonary
embolism.  She was started on treatment for a COPD exacerbation.
In the ED she was placed on Bipap which was soon weaned off on
arrival to the MICU. She was given methylprednisolone 60 mg
q8hrs, albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6 hrs, and albuterol q2 hrs
as needed. She was also started on a 5 day course of
azithromycin. Home advair was continued. Tiotropium was held
while on ipratropium nebs. She was also provided with a nicotine
patch during her hospitalization.  Her status improved from
admission, but her improvement plateaued and she remained
hypoxemic, requiring continuous supplemental oxygenation. In
walking with physical therapy, she desaturated to the 80%s with
minimal exertion on 6L NC. Overall, her clinical status appeared
consistent with end-stage COPD.

Although additional time in the hospital may have improved the
patients condition prior to discharge, she was adamently focused
on going home. She acknowledged that going home without further
treatment constituted a health risk, and that she was at risk of
dying if she went home. She was consistent and clear in her
wishes, and continued to emphasize her desire to go home
throughout her hospitalization. On [**7-2**], she frankly demanded to
go home and threatened to sign out AMA if she was not
discharged. She again acknowledged the potential risks of going
home, including death. She stated "if I die when I go home, at
least I'll die at home and not in the hospital." Given that her
wishes were consistent and she was demonstrating clear
understanding of the risks involved in her decisions, we offered
her a palliative care consult to address the anticipated
symptoms of dyspnea and air hunger she is certain to experience
at home. She accepted the consult, and with the addition of
palliative care and the hospice team focusing on end-stage
issues, we felt it was appropriate to discharge home with
hospice given her clearly and consistently stated wishes, her
end-stage COPD, and the comprehensive planning that has taken
place around her discharge for out-patient symptom management.

Her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], was informed of
these discussions and events prior to her discharge.

#) Depression/schizophrenia: Continued home citalopram and
trazodone. Patient unsure if she was taking abilify and this was
held during her hospitalization.

#) Hypertension: continued Diltiazem 120mg and Aspirin 325mg

#) GERD: continued famotidine

ICU Course:
Day 1:
Weaned off BiPAP, IV methylpred, scheduled nebs, intermittently
hypoxic to the mid 80's so she was and on and off face tent

Day 2:
By rounds patient was improved from presentation, on nasal
cannula, transitioned to PO steroids, desaturated to 80s prior
to transfer to floor, so transfer was cancelled and she remained
in the ICU

Day 3:
Patient adamant
