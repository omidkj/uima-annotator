History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 91062**] is an 88 year-old female with PMHx of afib,
dementia & hyperthyroidism who is transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
with septic shock most likely from a UTI. The patient is unable
to give much history, but per her daughter, the patient has been
having strong smelling urine x 1 week with associated confusion
and generalized weakness. At baseline, the patient is able to
perform her ADLs by herself and is A+O to self and place, but
does not know date. Today the patient did not want get out of
bed and daughter found pt was too weak to walk. No fever /
chill, falls, no head injury, no CP no SOB, abdominal pain
currently. Brought in by daughter to [**Hospital1 **] [**Name (NI) 620**] where she was
febrile to 103.3, and had grossly infected urine and ?R sided
lung infiltrate on CXR. Labs at BIDN were significant for WBC
25.5, Cr 1.8 and UA with 50-100 WBCs, troponin < 0.01, LFT
34/19/94/1.09, guiaic neg. There, the patient received
vancomycin 1g IV, ceftriaxone 1g IV, tylenol 1g and 4L NS. BPs
were in systolics 70s; RIJ CVL was placed and she was started on
a neosynephrine drip at 1mcg/kg/min (of note, line had to be
pulled back as it was initially in the R atrium). Per [**Location (un) **],
during transfer systolic BPs were 100s-120s. In our ED, SBPs
80s-120s & pt has been in atrial fibrillation. Patient also
received Zosyn 4.5mg IV for broaden coverage. Labs here notable
for WBC 26.8 (no bands), Cr 1.1 and lactate 1.2. INR
subtherapeutic at 1.2. UA again demonstrated UTI with <1 epis,
large leuk, neg nitrite, many bacteria & >182 WBCs. VS on
transfer were BP 123/71 HR 116, RR 19 98% RA, temp 98.9 (oral)
and phenylephrine gtt at 1mcg/kg/min.

On arrival to the MICU, Pt's VS are 100.5, 122, 64/50, 94% on RA

Lower extremity ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein

Chest x-ray [**2105-10-27**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral lower lobe opacities concerning for infection.
Probable mild
volume overload.
2. Mild cardiomegaly.
3. Pleural plaques suggestive of prior asbestos exposure,
correlate
clinically

Echocardiogram [**2105-10-27**]: Conclusions
The patient is on a Neosynephrine drip @ 0.5 mcg/kg/min
Left ventricular EF is 45-55% with no regional wall motion
abnormalities.There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. [**Month/Day/Year **] [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion
