Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with no intervention
endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
46 y/o man with EtOH abuse and no other significan PMHx who
became uncousious while at the bar, received CPR and presented
to SLH where he was found to have Vfib arrest s/p shock x1 and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
Pt. was in USOH until Saturday night when he awoke from sleep
and was c/o of chest pain.  He felt it was [**2-13**] GERD and this
apparently improved with repositioning.  When he awoke, he was
not himself (usually drinks with his brother in AM, but this
time did not due to not feeling well).  He felt malaised all
day, no frank CP complaints.  He then arrived at the bar around
6pm, ordered a beer, was talking with friends and then  suddenly
was noted by bystanders not to respond appropriately/confused.
Seconds later he fell backwards, eyes rolled up, no shaking or
urinary incontinence.  CPR was started within 1 minute b/c the
patient was apneic, CPR was for ~ 5 minutes, by time ambulance
arrived, patient had a pulse.
.
He was apparently given Narcan and became "awake" (per EMS
reports) though unclear if he followed commands.    Apparently
upon arrival to SLH he became unresponsive and was found to be
in Vfib arrest.  He received 150mg of Amiodarone, 1 shock and
had return of pulse within 1 minute of the arrest. S/p shock was
confused but moving all extremities. Earliest BP noted is
187/105 at [**2107**]. Was then intubaed and received ASA 325mg,
Amiodarone gtt.  EKG SR, tachy, STe V1 3mm and aVR 1mm, STd I,
aVL, V2-6.  Started on heparin gtt.  EKG then NSR, < 1mm STe V1
and aVR; STe III, aVF < 1mm; STd I, aVL, V4-6 of < 1mm.
Underwent CT H/N with concern for ICH, thus heparin gtt was
stopped.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cath.  Of note, had
a "posturing" episode, treated with 2mg of versed w/ resolution.
 Labs at OSH notable for CK 257, MB 2.4, MBI 0.9%, Troponin 0.14
(0 - 0.3), + urine cannabinoids, WBC 15K, K 3.2, AST 52, ALT of
39, EtOH of 107,  and ... "+pregnancy test"
.
VS in ED arrival were 97 157/93 30.  Pt. was bucking the vent
and moving all extremities.  He was started on
Propofol/Midazolam/Fentanyl.  EKG showed SR, STe V1 4mm, aVR
<1mm and III/aVF < 1mm; STd I, aVL, V4-6. Labs in the ED notable
for Troponin of 0.28 and WBC of 14K. CT head was repeated and
was negative for ICH.  He received Amiodarone 1mg/min IV gtt,
Heparin gtt, Clopidogrel 600 mg, Atorvastatin 80mg.  TTE showed
no sign. WMA and low/normal EF.  Repeat EKG: SR, nl axis, STe V1
as above but not elsewhere and no STd.  Cooling not initiated
given spontaneous movements and mouthing of words.  Patient
transferred to CCU for further care.
.
In CCU, VS were 84 124/84 26 on AC 50%FiO2, 500/5/22.  Sedated,
intubated.
.
Unable to obtain ROS but per girlfriend: has been c/o of
intermittent chest pressure since [**Month (only) **], started on PPI with
some improvement.
.
No prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. No
recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review of
