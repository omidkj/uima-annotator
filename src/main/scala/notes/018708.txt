Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 63 yo man with pmh significant for recent CABG in [**5-/2121**]
at [**Hospital1 336**] who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU from OSH where he had
an upper GI bleed shortly after EGD dilitation of a shatzski's
ring.

PAF
CABG
CAD

Social History:
Lives with wife in the [**Hospital3 **].  He works as a welder. He
drinks about 12-20 beers
per week. He smoked approximately [**12-20**] pack for years but quit in

[**2084**].


Family History:
non contributory

Physical Exam:
On physical examination, he is a healthy-appearing
male in no distress. Pulse was 84 and regular, blood pressure of
118/85 and a respiratory rate of 12.
There were no skin lesions. His HEENT exam had no oropharangeal
thrush and no conjunctival abnormalities. There was no jugular
venous distension, thyromegaly, or cervical lymphadenopathy. His

chest examination was pertinent for left sided basliar rales,
otherwise clear to auscultation
and percussion. His cardiac exam had no murmur, rub,
or gallop. His abdomen was non-tender and had no
liver or spleen enlargement. There was no peripheral
cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.


Pertinent Results:
ECHO-Conclusions:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 60-70%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic. No aortic
regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve
prolapse. There is a small posterolateral pericardial effusion.
There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

CXR ([**2121-7-29**])-IMPRESSION: Two subtle patchy opacities at both
lung bases which may represent atelectasis. However, a pneumonia
cannot be excluded. Unchanged small left pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the MICU from OSH for management of GI bleed.
 Pt required minimal blood support in the MICU as active
bleeding had subsided.  Hospitalization was complicated by
multiple episodes of chest pain without consistent presentation
or relation to exertion.  Myocardial infarction was ruled out
each time with negative cardiac enzymes and EKG's showing no
acute changes.  Towards the end of Mr. [**Known lastname 41592**] hospitalization
he developed fevers, a cough, and CXR showing possible
pneumonia.  He was treated with Levofloxacin and he central line
was pulled, growing CoNS also sensitive to Levofloxacin.  Pt had
multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation throughout the
hospitalization, for which he had a known history.  This was
difficult to manage as he was unsuitable for anti-coagulation
with coumadin and so aspirin was used alone due to recent
history of GI bleed with need to repeat EGD in near future.
Additionally, rate control was difficult due to patient's low
normal blood pressures.  The rate was eventually controlled
without affect on the blood pressure, patients pneumonia
symptoms improved, and he was discharged to follow up with his
primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 151**] the plan to restart the
anti-coagulation at a later time.  Pt was discharged to complete
a course of Levofloxacin as treatment for line infection and
pneumonia.
