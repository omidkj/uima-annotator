Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy, s/p stent placement and tissue biopsy


History of Present Illness:
69yo woman originally admitted to [**Hospital **] Hosp with N/V back
pain.  She had a panendoscopy which revealed gastritis and
inflammatory bowel disease. Patient was placed on Asacol but
symptoms persisted.
.
She underwent an MRI for further workup which showed disc
herniation, T8-T10, and incidentally also a 6cm subcarinal mass.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy, found L mainstem obstruction,
tried to bx but c/b bleeding, needed intubation for airway
protection.
.
Transferred to BIMDC to IP service.  A rigid bronchoscopy was
performed and a stent was placed in the left main stem with
improved aeration of the left lower lobe. Preliminary pathology
was consistent with non-small cell lung cancer. Patient reported
decreased appetite, nausea and weight loss of 40 pounds. She was
already seen by Heme/Onc in the trauma SICU.
.
She was extubated on [**5-28**] in the am.  In the trauma SICU, it was
felt that she had a LLL PNA and was started on levofloxacin.
She was also found to be hypertensive after extubation and
received on IV hydralazine. Her BP remained well controlled
after that. She was still somnolent in the afternoon after the
procedure. She last received 1mg of Ativan at 8am. Her VS were
stable upon transfer.

.
CXR ([**2173-5-27**]):
Stent in the left main stem bronchus, with improved aeration of
the left lower lobe.
.
CT Chest ([**2173-5-26**]):
1. Large subcarinal mass (5.7 x 4.8 x 2.8 cm) which is
indistinguishable from the esophagus and encases the central
bronchi, narrowing the left mainstem bronchus to 4 mm. The right
main bronchus and bronchus intermedius are encased but appear
normal in caliber.
2. Additional mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy
including a prevascular node measuring 2.8 x 1.1 cm, a lower
left paratracheal node measuring 2 x 1.3cm and 1-cm bilateral
hilar lymph nodes.
3. Spiculated 14-mm left upper lobe lesion which may be
neoplastic or inflammatory.
4. Left lower lobe consolidation, most consistent with
pneumonia.
.
Lung tissue biopsy ([**2173-5-27**]):
NSCLC
.
CT Abdomen/pelvis ([**2173-5-29**]):
1. There is a small left pleural effusion and basilar
atelectasis.
2. No lymphadenopathy is detected within the abdomen or pelvis.
3. Dense calcified atherosclerotic plaque within the descending
abdominal aorta and iliac branches.
4. Emphysema
.
MRI head ([**2173-5-30**]):
A small amount of chronic microvascular ischemic change without
evidence of enhancing abnormality to indicate the presence of
intracranial metastatic disease.
.
Bone scan ([**2173-5-31**]):
No scintigraphic evidence of osseous metastases.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 y/o F found to have large lung mass at [**Hospital **] transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further car, now s/p rigid bronchoscopy with stenting
of left main bronchus and biopsy confirming NSCLC.
.
1. NSCLC/Lung Mass - Patient was monitored briefly in the trauma
ICU after the procedure. Pathology was consistent with NSCLC.
LDH and LFTs were wnl. Transient blood-streaked sputum after
bronchoscopy resolved towards the day of discharge. Megace was
continued for poor appetite. Metastatic workup (i.e MRI of the
brain, CT abdomen/pelvis and bone scan) were negative. Patient
is going to follow up with oncology as an outpatient. Likely
requiring consultation with radiation oncology for concurrent
chemotherapy/XRT, followed by consolidation chemotherapy (if
patient is able to tolerate). Patient should continue mucinex
until seen as outpatient by IP in 5 wks from now.
.
2. Pneumonia/Leukocytosis - Patient developed leukocytosis in
the trauma SICU but was also briefly on stress-dose steroids
(for possible cuff leak). Patient also had intermittent cough
with sputum production. Interventional pulmonology team felt her
clinical picture was consistent with PNA. Patient was started on
levofloxacin which was continued empirically when transferred to
the medicine floor. Sputum culture revealed no growth. Patient
completed 7 day course. Leukocytosis was trending down towards
discharge. Patient continued to have a cough but remained
afebrile and clinically stable.
.
3. HTN - Patient was hypertensive post-procedure requiring IV
hydral. Patient was restarted on her BB and HCTZ. Patient
remained intermittently hypertensive even after transfer to
medicine floor. Patient was started on an ACEI with increaesing
doses throughout her hospital stay. Her BB was also uptitrated.
She still required Hydral PO as needed for hypertensive episodes
but her BP became better controlled towards the end of her
hospital stay. She was discharged on an optimized regimen of BB,
HCTZ and lisinopril. She should follow up with her PCP who
should adjust these medications as needed.
.
4. Murmur - systolic murmur at USB with radiation to both
carotids. Not previously noted on OSH records. DDx included AS,
HOCM, flow murmur, ? related to bronchial stent. Murmur
disappeared after two days indicating that it was most likely
related to flow or transient tissue swelling from the
bronchoscopy and stent placement. Her PCP should monitor for
recurrence of this murmur and obtain an echo if needed.
.
5. AFib - paroxysmal per OSH records. Patient remained in SR
during this hospitalization. She was on no anticoagulation on
admission and was kept off any anticoagulation given malignancy
workup including uncertainty about brain metastases (prior to
acquisition of brain MRI). Patient should follow up with her
PCP.
.
6. IBD - recently diagnosed at OSH. Patient was continued on
Asacol.
.
7. Gastritis - Mild chronic gastritis diagnosed at OSH on EGD.
H. pylori negative per OSH records. Continued PPI and Reglan.
.
8. Chronic back pain - Patient underwent MRI study at OSH which
showed disc herniation, T8-T10, and incidentally also a 6cm
subcarinal mass for which she was referred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Metastatic
workup did not reveal any bone lesions (see above). Patient was
given Oxycodone as needed for back pain.
.
9. Psych - Continued Zoloft and Alprazolam.
.
10. F/E/N: IVF. Repleted lytes PRN. Cardiac diet.
.
11. PPx: Bowel regimen, PPI, sc Heparin
.
12. Access: PIV
.
