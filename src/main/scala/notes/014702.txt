History of Present Illness:
Briefly after review of night float admit note, this is a 65
y.o. female with h/o ESRD, DM, CHF, and osteomyelitis who was
sent to the ED from [**Hospital3 2558**] for increased facial swelling
and SOB as noted by the staff at [**Hospital3 2558**]. Upon
interviewing the patient this morning, she does not understand
why she is in the hospital. Her only complaint is a rash on her
buttocks. She has a h/o of chronic diarrhea but no N/V or
abdominal pain.
.
In the ED, she was found to have a decreased O2 Sat and started
on supplemental O2. In the ED she was found to have a systolic
pressure in the 80's and was given 500cc NS bolus. Her O2
Saturation was also 92 and she was started on 2L NC and it
improved to 97%. She was presumed to have a PNA and was given 1
dose of levofloxacin and then admitted.
.
Of note, patient had been started on a 10 week course of
nafcillin on [**2190-4-21**], per the records. She was still being
administered this course via a PICC prior to admission. The PICC
was removed during transfer from ambulance to ED.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 65 y.o. female with h/o ESRD, DM, CHF, and MSSA
osteomyelitis who was admitted with shortness of breath and
facial swelling, presumed secondary to SVC thrombosis.
.
# Facial and upper extremity swelling due to SVC thrombosis and
upper extremity DVT .  Pt. at risk w/ multiple central access
attempts (HD tunneled catheters) and a subtherapeutic INR.  UE
U/S with recannulization of left IJ.  When the patient lost
peripheral IV access, IR was unable to place a PICC, and so a
right femoral central line had to be placed for lone access.
When IR tried to replace a tunneled HD catheter that she had
pulled out, they found complete occlusions of left internal
jugular and occlusion at the junction of the R. IJV and R.
subclavian.  Therefore, it necessitated placement of a left
FEMORAL tunnelled HD catheter.  The above study also showed much
flow through tortuous collaterals, which may be suggestive of
chronic thrombosis in jugular/subclavian veins.  Pt. was seen by
vascular surgery during the hospitalization and they recommended
continuing anticoagulation, follow-up as an outpatient, and a CT
venogram if her symptoms worsen.  Earlier in the admission,
there was also concern for upper airway obstruction and stridor
but ENT evaluated on [**7-24**] and found no signs of extrinsic airway
compression.  Her upper airway symptoms improved with 3 doses of
decadron.  After all the IR procedures, the patient's warfarin
was being titrated while bridging with heparin gtt.  In the
interim, she developed hypotension refractory to fluid boluses.
She was found to have an infected right femoral line, at which
point it was pulled and she was transferred to the MICU.
.
# Access: Numerous access problems were encountered during this
admission.  Once she lost her peripheral IV, PICC placement was
sought at bedside and by IR, both of which failed.  The reason
for this was revealed during the re-insertion of a tunneled HD
catheter, S/P extirpation of the old one.  She was found to have
thrombus bilateral IJV obstruction and tortuous collateral flow,
possibly indicating chronic thrombosis.  A femoral line was
placed on [**7-23**] because of inability to get access anywhere else
for her heparin gtt.  Femoral line placement was complicated by
continued episodes of diarrhea, and due to development of
inflammation at line site and hypotension, this line was pulled
on [**7-31**].
.
# ESRD-HD: The patient pulled out her left tunneled HD catheter
(had pulled out her left on a previous admission).  A left
femoral tunneled HD catheter was placed on [**7-26**] and she has
tolerated dialysis will through this.  Patient was maintained on
calcium acetate, Epo with dialysis, and a low-potassium
low-phosphate diet while on the floor.
.
# CHF: EF 40%. Upper extremity and facial swelling more likely
due to SVC thrombosis than to heart failure.  Had crackles on
exam and a BNP that was 70,000 on admission, which was quite
suggestive of CHF but somewhat difficult to interpret in the
setting of renal failure.  Unable to diurese due to ESRD, so
volume reduction achieved through HD.  Prior to discharge, we
were planning to restart ACE-I and BB at low dose for CHF if her
pressures were able to tolerate it.  We were also careful about
giving her no more than 250cc boluses due to CHF and ESRD.
.
# ID: Patient was receiving a prolonged course of antibiotics
for MSSA osteo/discitis.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], her ID specialist, was
informed of her admission.  We obtained ESR and CRP which were
elevated, but per ID, these were decreased from previously and
not really indicative of continuing osteomyelitis.  As a result,
Abx therapy for osteomyelitis was discontinued.  She was
maintained on a course of prophylactic metronidazole for a h/o
recurrent C. difficile colitis, continued diarrhea and a h/o
prolonged Abx course, although C. difficile toxins were
negative.  Pt. was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in the [**Hospital **] clinic for her osteomyelitis.
.
# DM2:  The patient was maintained on her home regimen of NPH
with an insulin sliding scale while in house.
.
# Hyperchol: Patient was maintained on her home regimen of
atorvastatin.
.
# Hypothyroid: The patient's TSH continued to be elevated at 24
on admission and fT4 was also decreased.  We spoke with
endocrinology regarding an already quite high dose of
levothyroxine (225mcg).  They felt that there may be a drug
interaction or physiologic process that is impairing
levothyroxine absorbtion.  However, they said it would be
alright to raise the dose of levothyroxine further if needed.
It was raised to 250mcg per day.  Patient will need outpatient
follow-up of her TSH in 6 weeks.
.
# PPx: PPI given for GERD.  Patient was anti-coagulated with
warfarin S/P IR procedures and bridged with heparin gtt.
