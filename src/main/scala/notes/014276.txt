Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
30yoM h/o HTN and polysubstance abuse, with h/o type B
aortic dissection in [**2193**] s/p L posterior lateral thoracotomy
with resection of dissecting aneurysm and replacement with
GelWeave tube graft, now transferred from [**Hospital6 72362**] with chest pain and concern for enlarging descending
thoracic aneursym on CTA chest. Reportedly, he presented to OSH
with L chest pain starting at 0400 on [**8-26**], similar to previous
symptoms in [**2193**]. Of note, no complaint of abdominal and/or back
pain. He admitted to EtOH and cocaine use on [**8-25**], and was found
to have +cocaine and +THC in a urine tox screen. At the OSH, he
was given nitropaste for BP 175/119, underwent CTA chest, and
was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. Prior to
arrival,
he received ativan, morphine, and fentanyl, and subsequently
arrived lethargic yet arousable, but not alert.

In [**2192**], he was found to have a type B dissection and was
initially treated medically as the descending aortic dimension
was approximately 3 cm, although presented in [**1-/2194**] with
recurrent symptoms and was found to have a rapidly expanding
aneursym (3 to 5.4 cm over approximately 5 months) on CT scan.
The dissection extended from the arch into the proximal left
subclavian artery to the descending abdominal aorta to both
iliacs. He underwent repair of the dissection (distal aortic
arch/L subclavian to T8) with placement of a GelWeave tube graft
under the care of Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **], and [**Doctor Last Name **].
He was subsequently readmitted in [**12/2196**] following MVC; at that
time, CT torso revealed an increased size of the aortic aneursym
with increased intramural thrombus below the SMA, dissection
from
T9 to the proximal CIA bilaterally.

He was admitted to ICU for BP monitoring with no acute surgical
intervention as the size did not meet criteria for surgical
repair.


Past Medical History:

abuse(cociaine, marijuana, etoh), h/o suicide attempt,

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 72360**] was admitted on [**8-26**] from an OSH with concern for an
enlarging descending thoracic and infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm; at the time of admission he was positive for etoh and
cocaine.  He was placed in the CVICU on a nicardepiene gtt for
blood pressure control. He was started on home meds and a
cardiology consult was obtained. He was ruled out for an MI. His
blood pressure was well controlled, and the gtt was able to be
weaned off in the early morning of HD 2.  He remained free of
pain and was transfered to the VICU step-down unit on HD2 for
further monitoring. He was closely monitored and blood pressures
remained stable. He tolerated a regular diet and ambulated
independently.  He was seen by Social Work and agreed to take
information regarding detox/rehab programs. He was heavily
counselled by the surgical team, nursing staff and social worker
regarding his drug abuse and the risk that this will exacerbate
his medical condition and quite possibly lead to death. On the
evening of HD 2 he left the VICU without permission and went
outside. It is unclear what exactly he did while off the floor,
but he did return without any change in his condition. He was
counselled on the need to remain on the floor with telemetry and
that he was not allowed to leave the floor or the hospital under
any circumstances. On HD 3 his blood pressure remained stable
and he continued to be pain free.  He was deemed stable for
discharge home with close follow up.  He was again counselled at
length regarding the need to stop drugs and alcohol, to control
his blood pressure and to appropriately follow up. Of note,
cardiology recommended he stay on his coreg (beta blocker). He
is scheduled for follow up with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 7659**] next week and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 4 months with repeat CAT scan.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Descending thoracic and infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You have an aortic aneurysm.  This needs to be monitored very
closely and may eventually need surgical repair.  It is
extremely important that you keep your follow up appointments
with your primary care physician and your vascular surgeon for
appropriate monitoring of this condition.

DO NOT SMOKE AND DO NOT USE DRUGS - ESPECIALLY COCAINE. These
things can cause your aneurysm to enlarge or even rupture which
could cause death. You also need to check your blood pressure
regularly and be sure to take your medications.

We strongly encourage you to get drug counselling and
