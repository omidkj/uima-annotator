Chief Complaint:
"subjective fevers, diarrhea and dry cough."

expired


History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 yo M with PMHx of HTN, HLD, DM-2 and MDS-RAEB-II
s/p 6 cycles of vidaza who presents with 3 days of weakness and
subjective fevers.

The patient was recently d/c from the OMED service on [**2149-9-30**]
after presenting on [**2149-9-25**] with a cc of weakness and bleeding
gums.  He was found to be pancytopenic and received multiple
transfusions and was also treated with empiric antibioitcs for
neutropenic fever.  A CT thorax showed multifocal parenchymal
nodular opacifications.  The patient was discharged on oral
levoquin, acyclovir and fluconazole.  He also p/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] with creat
peak to 1.6.  There was a concern for a MDS transformation and
BMB was done in house.  The final read was pending at the time
of this note but was reported to be carcinoma of unknown
primary.

THe patient reports that he was able to get out of bed with
assistance last Thursday following his discharge.  He localizes
his weakness mostly to his rle on the side were he got his BMB.
He has gotten prior BMB and has not had a similar reaction.  The
patient denies any known discharge from the puncture from the
BMB.  The patient localized his pain to the right side of his
back and rates it as [**7-25**].  He thinks the pain has been
progressively getting worse.  The patient denies UE or lle
weakness.  Saturday in the AM the patient experienced subjective
fevers and they did not recurr after that.  The patient had been
complaint with his antibitoics at home.  Denies cough, dysuria
or other localizing signs of infection.

The patient also reports loose BM's X3.  They were non-bloody
and the patient normally goes once a day.  The increase in BM
started once the patient started abx.  He has no accompanying
abdominal pain.

ROS is otherwise normal except per above

CT thorax [**2149-9-26**]
1. Multifocal parenchymal nodular opacification as detailed
above concerning
for infection, with atypical infections such as fungal infection
not excluded.

2. Large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.

3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely attributed to the
patient's known
blood dyscrasia.


Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course:
Patient was transferred to the ICU on [**10-8**] with respiratory
distress and tachycardia in the setting of known MDS and
squamous cell malignancy involving the bone marrow and overall
poor prognosis.  He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory
failure.  He developed a septic picture.  Patient with known
C.dif colitis, so, since no other source of infection was found,
presumed to have fulminant C.dif colitis.  Patient was on
Vancomycin PO, IV and PR for C.dif colitis as well as broad
spectrum antibiotics to cover essentially any infectious source.
 Despite this, patient's blood pressure continued to decline.
He was started on pressors, and maxxed out on Levophed, Neo,
Vasopressin.  Despite agressive treatment, he was unable to
maintain adequate blood pressures and passed away on [**10-10**].

This is a 74 yo M with PMHx of HTN, HLD, DM-2 and MDS-RAEB-II
s/p 6 cycles of vidaza who presents with 3 days of lethargy,
subjective fevers and diarrhea.
.
#Clostridium difficile colitis: Pt was admitted with diarrhea
and subjective fevers and fatigue following recent discharge
during which he was treated with vancomycin/cefepime for
neutropenic fevers and sent home with lovenox for CAP and
fluconazole and acyclovir for prophylaxis. On admission he was
found to be febrile with and Cdiff stool toxin assay was
positive so he was started on PO flagyl. He began to describe
pain in his throat making it difficult for him to swallow so his
antibiotics were switched to IV. He then began spiking fevers to
102 despite IV flagyl and was started on IV vanc and cefepime.
He then triggered on [**10-8**] for tachypnea, labored breathing,
tachycardia to the 130's and hypotension as low as the high 80's
systolically. He was treated with bolused fluids and his
pressures improved, he desatted to 88 on RA and was started on
O2 and began satting well but remained tachycardic and continued
to have labored respirations. He was also started on PO
vancomycin. CXR demonstrated worsening of a left pleural
effusion and ABG demonstrated mixed respiratory alkalosis and
non-gap metabolic acidosis which we assessed as a combination of
sepsis and diarrhea. We had mild concern for PE but felt he was
too unstable for CT scanner. Abdominal XR showed no free air and
was not concerning. He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] overnight.
.
#RLE weakness: Pt was admitted complaining of RLE weakness but
had equivalent strength on exam but continued R hip pain which
has been a chronic issue following a hip replacement ~20 years
ago. He had a bone marrow biopsy at the right pelvis during his
recent admission and had mild tenderness at the site but no
signs or symptoms otherwise concerning for infection. XR of the
R hip was normal and our clinical suspicion wasn't high enough
to perform MRI to look for osteomyelitis. His CRP and ESR were
severely elevated but this was felt to be related to his Cdiff
colitis as above.
.
Worsening Pancytopenia: Pt with poor production from severe MDS
and new diagnosis of invasive squamous carcinoma (presumably
from lung primary but primary unknown) infiltrating his bone
marrow rendering him tran
