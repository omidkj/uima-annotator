History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 18995**] is a 87 yo M w/ h/o aortic disease, critical AS, CAD
planned for CABG and AVR the day after admission [**2143-3-27**] who
presents with BRBPR. Of note, the pt had a cardiac cath [**3-19**]
which showed 80% LAD and bifurcated diag with >70% stenosis in
both poles. Post op course was complicated by formation of a
pseudoaneurysm. Pt presented to the ED [**3-24**] with complaints of
increase in size of groin hematoma. At that time, US showed no
flow into pseudoanaerysm which was thought to be thrombosed. Pt
was sent home by vasc surgery from the ED.
.
On Sat [**3-23**], pt was constipated and took prune juice resulting
in a BM. When he wiped, there was some blood on the toilet
paper. In the evening [**2143-3-25**], pt had BM, noted blood on the
toilet paper and also around the mostly brown stool. In [**Name (NI) **] pt
had a streaky brown marroon stool. Initial vitals were T 98.5 P
82 BP 129/37 R 15 O2 sat 100 on RA. There, he was found to have
HCT 24.5 from 26.6 2 days prior. Of note, pt had cauderization
of cecal AV malformation at an OSH in [**2141**]. In the ED, the pt
became hypotensive from BP 130/37 on arrival to a low of SBP 86.
HR 80s rose from to 90s (pt is normally not on any beta blocker
at home). At no time in his ED course was the pt symptomatic
although he did admit to fleeting lightheadedness on the day
prior to admission.  GI was consulted from the ED and
recommended PPI gtt which was started and transfusion of PRBCs
for goal HCT>30. They stated they would talk to the ICU team on
arrival about possible EGD on day of admission. 2 units of PRBCs
were ordered in the ED and the first hung just prior to transfer
to the ICU. Pt was given about 2L IVF in the ED. 2 large bore
IVs were placed in the ED.
.
In the ED, the pt refused NGT and when this was brought up, he
began to c/o chest pain. EKG at that time showed ST depressions
in V2 and V4-6 which were worse from earlier in the day, new STE
in AVR and the pt was thought to be in an irregular rhythm ?
multifocal atrial tachycardia. After the pt was told that an NGT
would not be attempted since he had refused it, his CP resolved.
Cardiology was called from the ED who said, given the pt's
bleeding, there was nothing more to do but that they would
follow the pt in the ICU. Cardiac surgery was also made aware of
his admission given his planned surgery on [**2143-3-27**].
.
On the floor, pt is c/o [**4-8**] left sided chest tightness with out
lightheadedness, SOB or palpitations. Pt states he has had
similar chest pain for several months. Usually resolves with
drinking cold water and rest.

[**2143-3-27**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-3-20**],
pulmonary artery pressures can be assessed on the current study
and are mildly elevated. Aortic stenosis remains crtical.

Brief Hospital Course:
87-year-old male with history of CAD, critical AS planned for
CABG, AVR presented with BRBPR and demand ischemia.

# Bright red blood per rectum: The patient had a 3 point Hct
drop in 2 days and 1 maroon stool by report. The patient was
transfused 3 units of packed RBCs to a Hct over 30. Stool guaiac
was trace positive in the ICU. GI was consulted and did a
colonoscopy. They found evidence of hemorrhoids and diverticula
and one rectal polyp without evidence of active bleeding. The
patient was discharged with stable hematocrit.

# Chest pain: The patient developed chest pain. He had a planned
CABG and AVR. After blood transfusion the patient was
asymptomatic. The patient was continued on his lipitor and
anticoagulation was held. The patient had a slight cardiac
enzyme elevation which is likely secondary to demand ischemia.
The patient cardiac enzymes were trending down at the time of
discharge. After the colonoscopy the patient was started on
metoprolol succinate and diovan per outpatient regimen.

# Severe AS: The patient also has significant CAD. He was
scheduled for a CABG/AVR however developed the GI bleed. He
remained chest pain free while he was an inpatient in the
hospital. The patient was continued on the above CAD
medications. He was evaluated by CSurg and scheduled for a
CABG/AVR in the near future. Plavix and aspirin were held in
anticipation of the surgery and the recent GI bleed.

# Hypertension: Antihypertensives were held in setting of GI
bleed. They were restarted at time of discharge.

# Dyslipidemia: Continued statin.
