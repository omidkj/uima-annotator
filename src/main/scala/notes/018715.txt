Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80433**] is a 77yo gentleman with h/o COPD and recurrent
aspiration pneumonia who presented to the ED with complaint of
shortness of breath and productive cough.

He reports that symptoms began about 1 day ago with difficulty
breathing and a cough. He is not sure if the cough is
productive. He has had episodes of vomiting following coughing
fits but denies nausea. He denies fevers, chest pain, or
myalgias. He is not sure about diarrhea, but thinks he has had
some loose stools.  Of note, he received his seasonal flu
vaccine but not the H1N1 vaccine this year.

In the ED, initial VS were 101.2 125/60->95/61 116 40s 100% on
NRB (had been 70% on RA at his NH). He was markedly tachypneic
with decreased breath sounds on the left. His UA was noted to be
positive. ABG was 7.42/43/85 on a non-rebreather; lactate was
1.9. He was started on biPAP with improvement in his dyspnea and
tachycardia. He received zosyn and vancomycin as well as
solumedrol. He had a swab for the flu and was started on
tamiflu. He was given a 500cc bolus of IVF just prior to
departure from the ED.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, he was insistent on sitting as upright
as possible to help his breathing. Denied thirst.

CXR [**1-26**]: Persistent severe scoliosis and extensive elevation
of the left hemidiaphragm are unchanged since [**2166-5-31**].
The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged since
[**2166-12-28**]. There
are no new focal opacities. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
effusion.
Mild left basilar atelectasis is stable.   IMPRESSION: Stable
elevated left hemidiaphragm and severe scoliosis. No acute
intrathoracic process.

CXR [**1-30**]:
As compared to the previous examination, there is a minimal
improvement with a small left apical portion of lung parenchyma
that is
ventilated. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. Subtotal
opacification
of the left hemithorax, severe scoliosis, no evidence of newly
appeared focal parenchymal opacity in the right lung.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 77-year-old man with h/o COPD (no firm diagnosis and
no smoking history) as well as severe restrictive lung disease
from scoliosis, Parkinson's disease, and severe left
hemidiaphragm elevation who was admitted with respiratory
distress in the setting of fever and cough. He has frequent
hospitalizations with empiric steroid and antibiotic treatments
with only short term improvement. During this admission, he was
placed on BiPAP which helped his respiratory distress.  He was
initially started on broad coverage with Vancomycin, Zosyn, and
Levaquin for possible HAP. He was also given Solu-Medrol x 3
days, then transitioned to oral prednisone taper. However, we
discontinued the steroids as his severe restrictive lung disease
and pneumonia could explain his wheezing and other respiratory
symptoms.  Eventually, his sputum grew pseudomonas which was
sensitive to ciprofloxacin. The antibiotic coverage for HAP was
narrowed to this single antibiotic.  However, we changed it to
Meropenem to cover the resistant PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA isolated
from a urine sample. He had a midline placed for Meropenem
treatment until [**2167-2-7**] to treat both HAP and UTI related to
Foley catheter. He needs aggressive pulmonary therapy to prevent
re hospitalizations and re infections. Goal of care and
palliative care should be involved if he continues with these
admissions with only marginal improvement.

# Fever:  Fever most likely from PNA or UTI.  His Foley was
changed and he was treated with antibiotics as above. Fevers
eventually resolved.

# Urinary Tract Infection:  Urine grew out pseudomonas sensitive
to meropenem.

# Tachycardia: Tachycardia on admission felt to be due to
respiratory distress and dehydration.  He was given IVF for
volume resuscitation and his tachycardia improved.

# Parkinson's disease: Continued on Sinemet and hyoscyamine.

# AFib: He was continued on amiodarone and was not on
anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed.

# H/o Hyperlipidemia:  Continued statin and ASA

# H/o DVTs:  His physical exam was closely monitored given his
history of line-associated and unprovoked DVTs in the past.  He
was not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed.

total discharge time 56 minutes.
