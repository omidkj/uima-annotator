Pertinent Results:
.
UTox.  [**2108-9-4**].  Positive for benzodiazepines, opioids,
methadone.
.
EKG [**2108-9-4**].
Marked sinus bradycardia. Q-T interval prolongation. RSR'
pattern in
lead V1. Since the previous tracing the QRS voltage has
decreased.
The Q-T interval remains prolonged. The RSR' pattern is more
apparent.
Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
Echo. [**2108-9-4**].
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size is top normal and free
wall motion is normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-6-19**], no
change.
.
[**2108-9-4**].  LE Doppler.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in bilateral lower extremity. The
previously
noted left posterior tibial venous thrombus is not visualized in
the current
study.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 10983**] is a 60 year old male with
Hypertension, history of recurrent PE s/p IVC filter not on
anticoagulation due to poor medication compliance, history of
substance abuse initially admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-4**] for drug
overdose (suspected seroquel, klonopin, oxycodone, methadone
overdose).  He was initially monitored in the ICU due to
bradycardia with a prolonged QT interval.  His QT interval
improved off seroquel and he was call out of the MICU.  His
hospital course was complicated by a left foot cellulitis at
site of IV on patient's foot, treated with one week of
Vancomycin and Unasyn.  He was getting ready for discharge when
he was found in his room unresponsive and hypotensive and then
sent back to the MICU.  Patient's BP and responsiveness improved
with monitoring and was suspected to be due to
Klonopin/oxycodone/methadone overdose, but he was ruled out for
PE with echo and LENIS which were unremarkable.  Patient left
AMA on [**9-25**] after being called out of MICU.
.
1.  Drug Overdose.   Patient initially admitted to MICU for
observation secondary to drug overdose and prolonged QT interval
of 0.52.  Patient has long history of drug abuse and he was felt
to have overdosed on seroquel, klonopin, oxycodone, and
methadone.  Toxicology was consulted initiall.  He was given a
dose of narcan and a dose of glucagon for concern of opioid and
beta-blocker overdose.  When his QT interval improved, he was
trasnferred out of the MICU.  Psych was consulted and did not
feel he had active suicidal ideation at time of transfer out of
MICU.
.
2.  Substance Abuse.  Patient has long history of drug abuse.
During his stay, he was often noted to be hording pills.  He
would not swallow the pills that were administered and he would
hide pills in his underwear.  When he returned to the MICU on
[**9-25**], it was suspected that had horded pills and then taken a
supply of these medications all at once resulting in minimal
responsiveness and hypotension.
.
3.  Cellulitis.  Patient noted to have a left lower extremity
cellulitis at the site of an IV.  He was treated with one week
of vancomycin and unasyn.  His antibiotic course was completed
while he was inpatient.
.
4.  Hypertension.  Patient reported to have history of
hypertension and reports significant concern about his blood
pressure being elevated.  However, blood pressure fluctuations
are likely related to drug abuse and withdrawal in addition to
baseline essential hypertension.  During hospital stay, his
antihypertesnives were uptitrated.  On [**9-24**], patient was found to
be hypotensive to 70s systolic and unresponsive likely secondary
to up-titration of antihypertensives plus suspected hording of
oxycodone/klonopin/methadone.  The MICU team felt that his
hypertension should not be aggressively managed given his
history of poor compliance as and outpatient and fluctuations of
BP due to drug abuse.  Patient seemed to be at greater risk for
episodes of hypotension than the consequences of chronic
hypertension.
.
5.  Hypotensive episode/unresponsiveness.  Patient transferred
to the MICU on [**9-25**] after a code was called.  He did not receive
CPR because he was found to have a pulse and SBP in 70s.  He was
suspected to have taken a stash of narcotics and benzos.  He
became arousable at the mention of narcan.  In the MICU, he was
evaluated for PE with echo which did not show right heart
strain.  He cannot get a CTA due to renal failure and V/Q scan
is likely to be difficult to interpret in setting of prior
multiple PEs.  He was started on empiric anticoagulation with
lovenox with the knowledge that he wo
