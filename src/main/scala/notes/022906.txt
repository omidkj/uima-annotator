Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient was unable to give much history at presentation due to
possible delirium and aphasia.  Information she was able to
provide as well as notes were used to formulate HPI.

This is an 80 year-old female with past medical history of CAD
s/p CABG, left CVA with residual right sided weakness and
expressive aphasia, and multiple bouts of pneumonia who
presented from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Nursing Home with lethargy and
fever to 102.  Patient had been noted to be falling asleep at
nursing home and had a non-productive cough. She had labs drawn
that showed a WBC of 28 and was sent to the emergency.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.3 110/68 130 16 93%2L. Patient
was triggered for hypoxia to 83% on RA which rose to 93% on 2L
O2. She was tachycardic to the 130s. She received vancomycin and
levofloxacin but developed redness around the IV and was
switched to pipercillin-tazobactam. Also got 1L NS. On transfer,
her vitals were P 86, BP 122/102, RR 18, O2 97% on 4L O2 by
nasal cannula.

On the floor, the patient complained of left abdominal pain as
well as shortness of breath and left flank pain.  She endorsed
chills with cough, dysuria.  Denied fevers, chest pain,
palpitations, N/V/D. Has residual right sided weakness of
upper/lower extremities and aphasia.

Review of systems:

OTHER RESULTS
==============
ECG [**2179-2-7**]:
Regular tachy-arrhythmia of uncertain mechanism - may be sinus
tachycardia with ventricular premature beat or possible other
supraventricular tachy-arrhythmia.  Modest intraventricular
conduction delay. Consider prior septal myocardial infarction,
although it is non-diagnostic. ST-T wave abnormalities are
non-specific but cannot exclude ischemia. Clinical correlation
is suggested.  Since the previous tracing of [**2178-2-4**]
tachy-arrhythmia is now present and ST-T wave changes are more
prominent.

ECG [**2179-2-13**]:
Sinus rhythm. Intraventricular conduction delay of left
bundle-branch block type. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2179-2-11**] there is no change.

Chest Radiograph [**2179-2-7**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild central congestion with left basilar opacity
likely
reflective of atelectasis and effusion though cannot exclude
pneumonia

Chest Radiograph [**2179-2-13**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing pulmonary edema has slightly worsened. Otherwise,
the radiograph is unchanged, with moderate cardiomegaly, a small
left pleural effusion and a retrocardiac atelectasis.

Chest Radiograph [**2179-2-14**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-10**] through 5:
Mild pulmonary edema continues to clear. Left lower lobe remains

consolidated, probably due to atelectasis and moderate left
pleural effusion.  Heart is somewhat enlarged but difficult to
see because of overlying left hemidiaphragm and lower lobe
atelectasis. No pneumothorax

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old woman with a h/o CAD s/p CABG, PVD, stroke with
expressive aphasia and R sided weakness, who was admitted from
nursing home on [**2179-2-7**] for fever 101 and desat to mid 80s on RA
and found to have a probable healthcare associated pneumonia.

1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: On presentation the patient
had a reported history of cough and fever with a ? of left
basilar infiltrate.  Given combination of clinical symptoms and
imaging finding she was started on treatment for pneumonia with
intravenous levofloxacin.  Unfortunately, she began to develop
infiltration at the site of her IV with redness and pain, which
raised concern for allergy.  Given this concern and her status
as a long-term resident of a nursing facility she was
empirically covered with pipercillin-tazobactam and vancomycin.
After transfer to the ICU on [**2-10**] for increased respiratory
distress (most likely due to CHF exacerbation) the
pipercillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime and levofloxacin
was added back on without any signs of allergic phenomena.
Patient was also noted to have thick secretions at the time of
transfer, which was thought to be contributing to her hypoxia as
well therefore she was started on acetycysteine nebs with
