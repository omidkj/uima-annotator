71F with PMH of colon CA s/p partial colectomy in [**5-/2137**], on
chemotherapy
since [**Month (only) 216**], who recently developed acute cholecystitis and
underwent a CCY [**2137-10-14**]. Post-op course complicated by increased
LFT's.  She was sent here for ERCP on [**2137-10-17**]. ERCP performed,
showing CBD stones.  Sphincterotomy was deferred due to
coagulopathy (elevated INR to 1.8), but biliary stent was placed
successfully.  The patient was transferred back to the [**Hospital1 3325**].  However, since returning her LFTs had not improved,
was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2137-10-19**] for possible repeat ERCP.
Additionally, her coagulopathy has persisted, for unclear
reasons.  Bilirubin 4->6, AST/ALT elevated, alk phos normal.
She has also been mildly anemic but no overt signs of bleeding.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 63834**] (surgeon) and her oncologist did not feel these
abnormalities were related to her surgery or chemotherapy.
Thus, she returns for further evaluation.  Of note, she was
diagnosed with a LUL PNA, and broadened to Vanco/Zosyn for
possible biliary infection plus HCAP.  She has also been given 2
units FFP for her coagulopathy and possible need for repeat
ERCP, as well as 2 units PRBCs.  She did have a ? rectal temp of
102.

On admission she complains of fatigue/weakness and shortness of
breath with cough.  The nebulizers help, though the albuterol
makes her shaky.  She endorses a recent BM with flatus.

CHEST CTA [**2137-11-22**]:No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
No mediastinal, hilar, axillary or internal mammary adenopathy.

There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath, its tip is identified within
the SVC.
There is a small pericardial effusion measuring maximum
thickness anteriorly
of 5 mm (series 2, image 35).
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Evaluation of the lung parenchyma demonstrates marked thickening
of the
interlobular septae with ground glass change identified within
the superior
segments of the right lower lobe (series 2, image 21), distal
segment of the
right middle lobe (series 2, image 25) and within the superior
segment of the
lingula (series 2, image 31). Inflammatory scarring is also
identified within
the superior segment of the left upper lobe. This is actually
unchanged when
compared to chest radiograph from [**2137-10-24**].
Findings most likely represent intercurrent infection. Other
differentials
include edema, and less likely hemorrhage. No pulmonary masses
or nodules.

Evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates pneumobilia within
the left lobe
of the liver with surgical clips identified in the gallbladder
fossa, and
plastic stent is noted in a decompressed CBD.

CT OSSEOUS SKELETON:
Evaluation of the bony skeleton shows multilevel degenerative
changes in the
dorsal spine with relative osteopenia of the bony skeleton
without osseous
destructive lesion.

IMPRESSION:
1.Negative study for CTPA.
2.Bilateral hazy ground-glass change consistent with
intercurrent infection or
resolving pulmonary edema. 3.Small bilateral effusions.



RUQ U/S [**2137-10-29**]:FINDINGS: There are no focal hepatic lesions.
There is pneumobilia
predominantly in the left lower lobe, as expected after ERCP.
Patient is
status post cholecystectomy with surgical clips and minimal
amount of fluid in
the gallbladder fossa. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
biliary duct
dilatation with the common hepatic duct measuring 4 and the
common bile duct
measuring 7 mm. A biliary stent is seen in the common bile duct.
There is no
evidence of common bile duct stones, however evaluation with
ultrasound is
limited. The pancreas is only partially visualized secondary to
overlying
bowel gas, but appears normal. The portal vein is patent with
normal
hepatopetal flow. The right kidney measures 9.6 cm, the left
kidney measures
10.1 cm. The abdominal aorta is normal. There is no free fluid.

IMPRESSION:
No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.

CXR [**2137-10-28**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-24**], there is some
decrease in the
opacification in the right mid and lower lung zones, most likely
representing
some decreasing atelectasis in a patient with improved degree of
inspiration.
Pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal at this time.
Central
catheter remains in place.




Brief Hospital Course:
71 yr/o F w/ stage IIIb colon Ca s/p partial colectomy in [**Month (only) 116**]
[**2137**], on adjuvant chemo since [**Month (only) **] who recently underwent a lap
chole and ERCP for cholecystitis with CBD stones presented with
increase in liver function tests, LUL opacity concerning HAP,
and fever. Early on admission was transfered from floor to ICU
for tachypnea and hypoxia.
.
# Tachypnea with hypoxia: likely [**2-26**] to fluid overload based on
CXR which showed vascular congestion and diffuse bilateral
opacities and exam with anterior crackles/wheezing and abdominal
rounding; also may be due to underlying PNA however it was
difficult see definite opacity in LUL described at OSH due to
volume overloaded on initial examination.
DX: BNP 6219, CE negative x 1, Sputum Cx contaminated, urine
legionella antigen is negative.  Treated with nitro ointment TP
0.25 in to venodilate and reduce preload/afterload. Patient was
aggressively diuresed with furesomide with electrolytes repleted
as needed.  Treated with Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for emperic Tx of HAP
(total 8 day course, continued through [**10-25**]).  Given
Xopenex/ipratropium nebs.  Tachypnea with hypox
