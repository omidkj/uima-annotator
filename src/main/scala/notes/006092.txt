Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Sulfa(Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortic valve replacement(#19 On-X), Mitral valve replacement
(#25/33 On-X), MAZE [**5-4**]


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 70yo F w/ PMHx of critical AS, Rheumatic heart
disease, HTN HLD, hypothyroidism, UC, atrial fibrillation who
presented from OSH with shortness of breath.

Patient reports that she went for cardioveresion [**2152-4-26**]. The
day after cardioversion, the patient developed sharp pain
beneath her breast and in the back. The pain is described as
sharp. She also noticed worsening SOB; she could not sustain her
energy level for the same duration. The patient also reprots
that she has not been able to sleep at night secondary to her
heart bounding. She denies SOB keeping her up at night. She has
stable 3 pillow orthopnea. She denies LE edema or increased
abdominal girth. Because of these symptoms, the patient went to
see her PCP who them referred her to the ED.

Patient presented to OSH with increaseing SOB and mid-back pain.
She was noted to have bilateral interstitial opacities on
imaging with right greater than the left and minimal bluding of
the right costophrenic angle, suggestive of PNA. She was placed
on IV antibiotics with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The patient
was noted to have low-grade fevers, of 100.7 on transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**]. The patient had blood cultures drawn at the OSH, that
were pending at the time of transfer, but have remained NGTD.
Upon transfer, the patient was noted to have an irregular beat,
satting 93% on 2.5L via NC.

Patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2152-4-12**] to discuss options
related to her critical aortic stenosis. During that visit, the
patient was thought to be a good surgical candidate for AVR. But
at the time, the patient was not a candidate for transcatehter
aortic valve replacement. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] planned to follow the
patient up in 3 months time to reassess her symptoms.

On arrival to the floor, patient reports shortness of breath.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, hemoptysis,
black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. Of note, she does report
vertigo.

Past Medical History:
--Rheumatic heart disease with mild mitral stenosis, mitral
regurgitation, moderate aortic insufficiency, preserved LV
function
--Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, s/p two prior cardioversions
in [**2143**] and [**2145**], and most recently 1 week prior to admission.
--Diastolic CHF
--Hypertension
--Hyperlipidemia
--Ulcerative colitis
--s/p CcY
--Bipolar disorder

Social History:
She is divorced and lives alone.   She quit smoking in [**2130**] and
denies alcohol or illicit drug use.


Family History:
There is no family history of hypertension, diabetes, heart
disease, or strokes.

NECK: Supple with JVD to the angle of the mandible.
CARDIAC: Ireegularly irregular, normal S1, but deminished S2.
Harsh 4/6 systolic cres/decres murmur best appreciated at the
RUSB. Holosystolic murmur radiating to the back as well. No
thrills, lifts. No S3 or S4.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp
were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. Crackles at the bases
bilaterally, extending to [**12-24**] the lung fields posteriorly. No
wheezes.
ABDOMEN: BS+. Soft, ND. Diffusely tender throughout the abdomen.
No rebound or guarding. No HSM.
EXTREMITIES: No c/c. Trace pitting edema bilaterally to the
knees. No femoral bruits.
NEURO: CN II-XII tested and intact, strength 5/5 throughout,
sensation grossly normal. Gait not tested.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES:  Right: DP 2+    Left: DP 2+

Pertinent Results:
Echocardiographic: [**2152-5-5**]
Conclusions
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is abnormal septal motion/position. A mechanical aortic
valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears
well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICINE COURSE:
.Patient is a 70yo F w/ PMHx of critical AS, Rheumatic heart
disease, HTN HLD, hypothyroidism, UC, atrial fibrillation who
presented from OSH with shortness of breath likely due to acute
on chronic diastolic CHF.

# Acute on Chronic diastolic CHF: Upon presentation, the patient
appeared volume overloaded with crackles [**12-24**] through the lung
fields posteriorly and elevated JVD to the angle of the
mandible. The patient was not on supplemental oxygen at
baseline, though was upon admission. She was ruled out for MI
with serial cardiac enzymes. Etiologies of the patient's acute
decompensation include worseing aortic stenosis versus atrial
fibrillation. She triggered for desaturation to 89% on 4L via NC
on evening of admission. Chest x-ray at the time showed
interstitial infiltrates concerning for pulmonary edema. She
received 10mg IV lasix initially and responded after the trigger
was called. The patient's volume status was assessed daily and
with diuresis 10mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **], the patient's respiratory
status improved with her saturating well on room air and clear
lungs bilaterally.

# Aortic stenosis: Critical aortic stenosis with valve area of
0.8cm2. Patient has been seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient for
evaluation. Per his note, patient is a good surgical candidate
and not a candidate for transcatehter aortic valve replacement.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and decided to prusue aortic valve
replacement pre-surgical work-up, which included TTE and carotid
ultrasound. The patient was taken to the operating room
Thursday, [**2152-5-4**].  There she underwent an aortic valve
replacement, mitral valve replacement, and MAZE procedure.  This
procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Please see the
operative note for details.  She tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the
surgical int
