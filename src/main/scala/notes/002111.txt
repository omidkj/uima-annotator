Imaging:
MRI Chest ([**2178-12-2**]): Extensive type B intramural hematoma
extending from the takeoff of the left subclavian artery through
the entire visualized thoracic and upper abdominal aorta.
Additionally noted on the current exam is marked delayed
crescentic enhancement of the entire aortic wall in the region
affected by the intramural hematoma, compatible with associated
engorgement of the vaso vasorum.  Lack of circumferential
enhancement argues strongly against aortitis.
.
AP Wrist Hand ([**2178-11-28**]):  Generalized osteopenia.  No definite
fracture or other traumatic injury.  The erosion of the right
triquetrum and the ulnar styloid process may be early indicators
of rheumatoid arthritis disease.  However, no further findings
to corroborate such a diagnosis are noted.
.
Shoulder Xray ([**2178-11-28**]):  Severe diffuse osteopenia, likely
secondary to osteoporosis. Given the severity of the osteopenia,
the sensitivity is decreased for detecting subtle nondisplaced
fracture.
.
CTA Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis with and without contrast
([**2178-11-23**]):1. Stable appearance of the chest, abdomen and pelvis
with type B intramural hematoma and associated penetrating
ulcer.  2. Improving ground-glass opacities. 3. Stable 4-cm
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.  4. Stable left common
iliac artery aneurysm.
.
WHITE BLOOD CELL STUDY ([**2178-11-23**]): No definite evidence for
acute peri-aortic infection.
.
CXR ([**2178-11-18**]): Borderline interstitial pulmonary edema is new.
Large heart is stable. There is no change in the mediastinal
contour of the generalized thoracic aorta. Small bilateral
pleural effusion, stable. No pneumothorax.
.
HEAD CT ([**2178-11-17**]): There is no intracranial hemorrhage. There
is no midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus. There is a
lacune within the left thalamus.  There are multiple foci of low
attenuation within the periventricular and  subcortical white
matter of both cerebral hemispheres most consistent with chronic
microvascular ischemic changes. There is atherosclerotic disease
within the anterior and posterior circulations.
.
CTA Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis ([**2178-11-17**]):  1. Unchanged appearance
of extensive Type B intramural hematoma from the subclavian
artery origin to the upper abdominal aorta. The associated
posterior penetrating ulcer at the diaphragmatic hiatus is
stable. No new
dissection.  2. Findings suggestive of congestive failure/volume
overload with bilateral pleural effusions and septal thickening.

3. Four-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. 4. Mild
aneurysmal dilation of the left common iliac artery. 5. Dense
coronary vascular calcifications.
.
Renal Ultrasound ([**2178-11-16**]): Normal arterial and venous waveforms
seen within the main renal arteries and veins bilaterally. Good
flow demonstrated within parenchymal branches of the mid and
lower poles bilaterally, upper pole is not well visualized
secondary to patient respiration.
.
CTA Chest ([**2178-11-14**]): 1) Extensive acute tupe B intramural
hematoma extending from the origin of the subclavian artery
throughout the entire thoracic and upper abdominal aorta.
Assessment of the distal abdominal aorta and iliacs is
suboptimal on this study.  2) Prominent posterior penetrating
ulcer at the level of the hiatus. 3) 3.7cm distal AAA. 4)
Evidence of volume overload with bilateral pleural effusions. 5)
Prominent subcarinal nodes, likely reactive.
.
ECHO ([**2178-11-13**]): 1. The left atrium is normal in size. The left
atrium is elongated. The  interatrial septum is aneurysmal.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. 4.The aortic root is moderately
dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly  dilated. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated.  5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.  6.The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. 8.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
EKG: Sinus rhythm. A-V conduction delay and A-V nodal
Wenckebach. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave flattening.
.
CXR ([**2178-11-12**]):  1. Tortuous aorta dilated up to 4.9 cm to the
level of the thoracic aortic  arch. This exam cannot prove or
rule out the possibility of aortic dissection or aneurysmatic
rupture. If clinically suspected further evaluation with  chest
CTA is recommended.  2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo F with intramural hematoma of thoracic aorta.  Hospital
course by problem:
.
1. Chronic TAA:
Initially, surgical intervention was not felt to be indicated as
it was a type B hematoma.  Her BP was managed initially with
labetolol and Nipride for goal SBP<140 and >100 given likely hx
of chronic elevated BP and risk for hypoperfusion.  She was
ruled out for an acute MI.  Her Hct dropped to 23.9 on [**11-14**] and
developed acute abdominal pain radiating to her back, so a CTA
was repeated and showed possible large intramural hematoma in
descending thoracic aneurysm.  Vascular Surgery was notified and
upon review of the scans w/ Radiology, felt the aneurysm was not
significantly changed.  We changed her antihypertensives and had
