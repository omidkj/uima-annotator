Service:  VSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72 year old
gentleman who underwent an endovascular repair of an
abdominal aortic aneurysm with a [**Hospital1 **] stent graft
approximately seven years ago at another institution. This
graft has developed endo leaks twice in the past which have
required endovascular repair.  The graft is extremely kinked
and tortuous and has developed yet a third significant endo
leak with aneurysmal expansion and he was advised to have
this graft removed and converted to a conventional repair.
The patient, therefore, presents to [**Hospital1 190**] for open repair of his abdominal aortic
aneurysm with removal of the aortic endo graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm, status post
endovascular repair and subsequent endo leak.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Zestril 20 mg p.o. q. Day.
2. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. Day.
3. Zocor 20 mg p.o. q. Day.


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his family.  He has a
long smoking history.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 62; heart
122/68; saturating 100 percent on room air.  General:  No
apparent distress.  Alert and oriented.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat:  Normal cephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Heart:
Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.  Lungs: Distant lung
sounds but clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, mild groin bulge in the right inguinal area. No
bruits.  2 plus femoral pulses bilaterally.  Extremities:
Clubbing of nail beds but no cyanosis.  2 plus dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibial bilaterally.  5/5 strength.  Sensation
is intact.  Neurovascular examination:  Cranial nerves 2
through 12 are grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit of 38.1; platelets 295; sodium
of 137; potassium of 4.6; chloride of 102; bicarbonate of 26;
BUN 18; creatinine 0.8; glucose 91.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2126-11-22**] for removal of
an aortic endo graft and repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm
with an aorta [**Hospital1 **]-iliac graft.  For further details of
surgery, please see associated operative note.  Initially,
the patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated and he
was doing well.  His pain was controlled with the help of an
acute pain service consult.  On [**11-24**], the patient began
to report respiratory distress with dyspnea.  No acute cause
for his respiratory distress was found.  On [**11-25**], while
changing a line, the patient again had respiratory distress.
Chest x-ray showed right lobe patchy infiltrates, consistent
with aspiration.  The patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for aggressive pulmonary toilette and
antibiotics.  He was followed by the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit team as well as the vascular team.  An electrocardiogram
obtained that day showed ST elevations.  The patient was
initially stable hemodynamically but quickly deteriorated
over the course of that day. His agitation increased and his
heart rate and blood pressure went up.  The patient had to be
intubated.  An nasogastric tube was in place.  The patient
was somewhat disoriented and had trouble remembering where he
was on the date.  The patient was started on Levofloxacin and
Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.  It was determined on
[**2126-11-25**], the patient had suffered a postoperative
myocardial infarction as he had electrocardiogram changes and
his troponin levels had bumped to 0.51 and his CK MB rose to
13.  A cardiology consult was called.  The patient had an
echo done that demonstrated an ejection fraction greater than
55 percent.  He underwent a head CT to further evaluate his
mental status changes as well as a carotid ultrasound that
showed no significant blockage.  His head CT demonstrated an
area of hypo attenuation in the left occipital lobe, in the
territory of the left posterior cerebral artery. This was
consistent with acute stroke.  A neurology consult was
obtained.  A magnetic resonance scan of the head was obtained
on [**2126-11-30**] and showed normal flow within the
arteries.  On this day, the patient self-extubated, but had
to be reintubated for the magnetic resonance scan.  The
patient was then  extubated on [**2126-12-1**] and tolerated
it well. He was maintained on Levaquin for gram negative rods
that grew out of his sputum.  On [**2126-12-2**], the
patient underwent and esophagogastroduodenoscopy for slight
red blood per rectum.  A small hiatal hernia was seen.  There
was a localized, linear erosion of the mucosa with a central
eschar and surrounding heaped up erythema at the
gastroesophageal junction.  There was no active bleeding.
This was presumed to represent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear or
esophagitis.  The stomach and duodenum were normal.  The
patient was continued on Protonix.  The patient was
transfused multiple times throughout his stay in the hospital
for a blood loss anemia, with a goal hematocrit greater than
30.  On [**2126-12-3**], the patient underwent a
colonoscopy.  Small streaks of clotted blood were seen in the
terminal ileum and cecum and a few also seen in the left
colon.  Careful lavage showed none of them were adherent to
any underlying region.  Grade two internal hemorrhoids were
noted.  A 2 cm patch of erythematous and edematous mucosa was
noted in the sigmoid colon at 30 cm from the anal verge.
There was the suggestion of a central depression but no
distinct ulceration. The surrounding mucosa was entirely
normal.  There was no stigmata of bleeding.  A biopsy was
taken.

To maintain the patient's nutrition, tube feeds were
necessary to keep his calorie counts high.  He also started
p.o. intake after he passed a swallow study on [**12-4**].
On [**2126-12-9**], the patient was stable enough to be
discharged to home with services.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home with services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Failed endovascular stent.
2. Postoperative volume fluid overload, corrected.
3. Aspiration pneumonia with respiratory failure, resolved.

5. Postoperative left occipital stroke.
6. [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear/esophagitis.
7. Internal hemorrhoids.
8. Blood loss anemia, transfused, corrected.
9. Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

2. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. Day.
3. Acetaminophen 325 mg to 650 mg p.o. every four to six
   hours prn for pain.
4. Lansoprazole 30 mg capsule, p.o. q. Day.


FOLLOW UP:  The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks and to call for an appointment.  The
patient was also instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of the
Neurology Stroke team in two months.
