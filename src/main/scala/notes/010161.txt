on levoquin but still worsend and was eventually admitted to
[**Hospital3 4107**] on [**2165-12-23**]. CT at that time demonstrated RUL

.
CXR: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient
in
upright position. Available for comparison is a preceding chest
examination transferred from another institution dated [**12-28**], [**2165**]. A left-sided PICC line is now identified and seen to
overlie the upper right-sided mediastinal structures consistent
with termination in the SVC at the level of the carina. No
pneumothorax has developed. Similar as on the preceding
transferred chest examination obtained approximately at 12 hours
interval, extensive confluenting infiltrates are present in the
right upper lobe area and is suspicious, cavitation is seen in
the apical area. Noteworthy is that previously existing in
diffuse perivascular densities on the lung bases have markedly
improved, which could be an expression of improved dehydration.
Markedly lowered and flattened diaphragms are observed
consistent with advanced COPD.


Brief Hospital Course:
Goals of care: discussed with family prognosis. Decision to make
comfort measures only. Terminal extubation. Patient expired.
Family members at bedside. Autopsy deferred.
.
Cavitary RUL Pneumonia: The patient was transferred from OSH
with large cavitary pneumonia in the setting of decreased
pulmonary reserve from COPD. The patient was treated with
vancomycin and zosyn. She was ruled out for MTb. She required
ICU admission for shortness of breath and hypoxemia. In the
MICU, broad antibiotic coverage was continued, however, despite
this the patient decompensated. She required intubation and
muptiple pressors for blood pressure support. Multiple attempts
were made at cultures, however, no causative organism was
identified. Fungal markers were negative and patient now not
significantly immunocomprimised so did not get antifungal
coverage. Ultimately, it became difficult to properly ventilate
patient with large pneumonia in setting of COPD. Furthermore,
the patient was not showing evidence of adequate treatment.
After discussion with the family it was decided to make the
patient comfort measures.
.
COPD: No evidence of acute exacerbation on top of large cavitary
pneumonia. Because of this steroids were weaned. Inhaled
medications were continued and oxygen was titrated as needed.
.
Nutrition: Very poor nutrition status likely from end-stage COPD
and inadequate intake. Nutrition consult was called with
supplements added to meals. Were considering feeding tube at
time decision made to withdraw care.
