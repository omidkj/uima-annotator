Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
GIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD x 2

History of Present Illness:
72F on warfarin and aspirin for AF, CHF EF 35%, CAD/PVD s/p
multiple stents and interventions, admit 7 months ago for UGIB
from ulcer requiring massive transfusion p/w 2 days of abd
cramps, dry heaves, and today with black tarry guiac + stools.
She states she was feeling fine prior to two days ago, noted
feeling increasingly fatigued yesterday. Had a BM that may have
been melena, but didn't see it. This AM she had a dark stool and
felt extremely weak, called her son to take her to the [**Name (NI) **].
.
Of note in [**2184-4-13**] patient had severe UGIB requiring massive
transfusion. EGD at that time showed large necrotic duodenal
lesion of unclear nature near a dudenal diverticulum. Colonic
diverticulosis was seen on CT abdomen/pelvis. At the time, she
declined surgical intervention so prophylactic embolization of
the gastroduodenal artery was performed by IR. Warfarin + low
dose aspirin were restarted at discharge due to her high risk of
stroke in the setting of Afib + CAD with s/p stents.
.
.
On presentation to the ED patient was hypotensive to the 80s, HR
100. Hct was 24.7 from baseline 30. Creatinine 2.2 from baseline
1.6-2.1. INR 2.7. She received 1200cc NS, 1 unit pRBCs, 1 unit
frozen plasma and 5mg IV Vit K. NG lavage with small amount of
coffee grounds that cleared after 500cc. Advanced IJ (3 lumen
and sheath) and PIV placed. Started on protonix drip with bolus
and admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and EGD. Vital
signs on transfer were 105/48, 98 20 96%RA.
.
.
On the floor, pt is complaining of lower abdominal tenderness,
feeling unwell, mostly disturbed by the NG tube. GI came to
evaluate the patient, EGD showed several gastric and duodenal
lesions. Prior to further assessment, pt had an aspiration event
and procedure was emergently discontinued. O2 sats dropped
briefly then improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
72F on Coumadin and baby ASA for AF, CHF EF 35%, CAD/PVD s/p
multiple stents and previous admission in [**4-/2184**] for UGIB from a
peridiverticular duodenal lesion admitted for GIB.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Gastrointestinal bleed: Initially suspected to be UGIB.  Pt
had coffee grounds on NG lavage and had documented h/o
persistent gastritis despite PPI therapy. Pt was on
anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. Was hemodynamically
stable on admission and underwent EGD which showed two small
ulcers in the stomach body with overlying clots as well as non
invasive gastritis, but EGD terminated prematurely when patient
went into V-tach and was shocked twice before stabilizing.  This
occurred shortly after intubation.  Pt remained intubated and
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], where she was monitored with q6h Hct checks
and transfused numerous times to maintain a Hct > 30.  She was
placed on pressors.  She was also given vitamin K and aspirin,
anti-hypertensives and coumadin were held.  She self-extubated
the morning after admission and was breathing well on her own,
but was re-intubated on HD3 for repeat EGD.  Second EGD showed a
few small ulcers in the stomach body with old blood as well as
angioectasias of the stomach body which were clipped and
injected with epinephrine.  She also had duodenal ulcers and a
duodenal diverticulum, at which fresh blood was seen.  She was
then sent to IR for embolization, where she got 300cc of
contrast during procedure. Bleed was not identified after 4h
search. During procedure got PRBC and IV fluids and was
subsequently weaned off pressors.  She continued to require [**2-15**]
PRBC transfusions per day.  IR declined further attempts at
embolization due to risk of bowel ischemia.  Surgery was
consulted and considered Whipple to resect duodenal ulcers, but
pt was a poor surgical candidate and pt's family also agreed
surgery was not in the patient's best interest. Pt's Hct
stabilized on HD5 and remained stable throughout the the
remainder of her hospitalization.

Her aspirin was held throughout her hospitalization, but, given
that she is on high dose PPI, and is off coumadin, it can be
restarted, with close attention paid to any signs of recurrent
GI bleeding.  HPylori ordered and is pending at the time of
discharge.

# Acute on chronic renal failure - Creatinine slightly elevated
from baseline 1.8 (was 2.2 on admission). Pt appeared dry on
admission exam, and in setting of acute bleed, prerenal etiology
seemed most likely.  Medications were renally dosed and she was
rescuscitated with fluids and PRBCs.  Creatinine returned to
baseline, and was 1.8 on day of discharge.

# Pneumonia: It was difficult to wean the patient off the vent
after second intubation.  Increased secretions and fevers
developed so she was suspected to have VAP.  CXR difficult to
interpret, so started empirically on vanc/zosyn.  Cipro was
later added for double coverage of pseudomonas.  She was found
to have H. flu on sputum on [**1-5**]. Her vancomycin was
discontinued and she completed an 8 day course of zosyn.

# Afib: The patient was continued on beta blockers, but she
developed atrial fibrillation with RVR.  She was put on
metoprolol 50 mg po qid and
