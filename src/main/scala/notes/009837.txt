Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10370**]
Chief Complaint:
lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Resusitation with Advanced Cardiac Life Support Protocol
Intubation
Central line placement


History of Present Illness:
55 M h/o HTN, DM, dyslipidemia, CAD. Was in USOH until day of
admit. States that he went to the bathroom to urinated, felt
lightheaded. Sat on the ground. Denied head trauma or LOC.
Summoned EMS who found him pale and diaphoretic, and with 1-2
seconds or jerking movements. FS in the field 543. Transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In ED, noted to be tachycardic with a HR 122, BP 157/82. Initial
ECG reportedly showed STD with TWI in v3-v5. First set of labs
were remarkable for hyperglycemia and a mildly elevated WBC at
11.9, but without left shift. At 21:45, was noted to be
hypotensive to the 60s. Dopamine was started and central venous
access obtained.
.
Given concern for a primary cardiac process, a bedside TTE by ED
staff was performed with concern for LV systolic dysfunction.
Cardiology was called to repeat a bedside TTE. This examination
showed no new WMA and overall preserved EF. A later echo
[**Hospital1 3780**] RV pressure overload.
.
His early hospital course was notable for gradual slowing of his
sinus tach in the low 100s down to sinus brady of high 40s with
subsequent sinus arrest with junctional escape in 40s. He
sustains this for a little over 1 minute and then a wide complex
rhythm at a rate of 70s, and ultimately PEA arrest.
.
On ROS, pt states he has had 2 weeks of a nonproductive dry
cough. No CP, SOB, n/v. Since earlier today, has had a "funny"
feeling on left side, under rib cage.
.

PERTINENT STUDIES
ECHO [**2101-10-5**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is severe symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. There is focal basal right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis with preservation of apical motion ([**Last Name (un) **] sign
is present). There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The descending
thoracic aorta is moderately dilated. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no systolic anterior motion of
the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular basal hypokinesis with pressure
and volume overload, consistent with hemodynamically significant
PE. Severe left ventricular hypertrophy and small chamber size
indicate decreased preload.

CTA [**2101-10-7**]
FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube tip is positioned at the carina.
There is a left-sided central venous catheter terminating in the
mid SVC. Orogastric tube cou
