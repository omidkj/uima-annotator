Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
Worst headache of Life [**Last Name (un) **] eating dinner

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**8-4**]: Cerebral angiogram with coiling of ACOMM Artery Aneurysm
[**8-8**]: Cerebral angiogram with intra-arterial verapamil
[**8-9**]: Cerebral angiogram with intra-arterial verapamil &
nicardipine
[**8-21**]: Trach and PEG
[**8-22**]: Cerebral angiogram with additional coiling of ACOMM


History of Present Illness:
61yoF, previously healthy, now transferred from [**Hospital6 10443**] with reported "worst headache of her life," found to
have diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and left ACOM aneurysm.
Reportedly, she was eating dinner at approximately 5:30pm when
she complained of a severe headache, suddenly became somnolent
and aphasic in association with acute onset of L-sided
hemiparesis. No trauma or h/o previous symptoms. She reportedly
proceeded to collapse and was brought to [**Hospital6 5016**],
where she became intubated for airway protection after witnessed
emesis. She received fentanyl and versed for sedation; no
anti-epileptics were given. Reportedly she did not follow any
commands and was observed to have decorticate posturing, left
upper extremity and withdrawal to painful stimuli, lower
extremities bilateral. At the OSH, she underwent a head CT which
revealed a large, diffuse SAH and was subsequently Medflighted
to
[**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical management.

Pertinent Results:
[**2119-8-3**] CTA head:  IMPRESSION: Recently ruptured left anterior
communicating artery aneurysm with extensive subarachnoid
hemorrhage and intraventricular extension. No evidence of
vasospasm, no other aneurysms.

[**8-4**] CT head: IMPRESSION:
1. New right frontal-approach ventriculostomy catheter
terminating in the
third ventricle.
2. Slight decrease in size of right lateral ventricle, with
bowing of the
septum pellucidum into the right lateral ventricle and unchanged
or slightly enlarged left lateral ventricle.
3. No increase in extensive subarachnoid blood.

[**8-7**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable size of the ventricular
system with right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter
stably terminating in the third ventricle. 2. Stable extensive
subarachnoid hemorrhage. 3. Interval introduction of
pneumocephalus seen within the right greater than left frontal
horns and the right temporal ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. NOTE ADDED AT
ATTENDING REVIEW: The patient is now status post coiling of an
anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. There is no evidence of new
hemorrhage. The left lateral ventricle is smaller than on the
study of [**2119-8-4**]. The right frtonal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is larger. There is a
small focus of hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, adjacent
to the hematoma and coil, new since the study of [**2119-8-4**], and
likely reflecting infarction.

[**8-8**] Head CT:IMPRESSION: 1. Unchanged appearance of subarachnoid
hemorrhage, left frontal hematoma and right frontal infarct.
2. Small amount of subdural hemorrhage along the falx
posteriorly to the
left, potentially related to the decompression from the
ventriculostomy
placement.

[**8-9**] Echo: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with severe global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process
(toxin, metabolic, etc. Multivessel CAD less likely, but cannot
be fully excluded). Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild
mitral regurgitation.

[**8-11**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with
the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-8-9**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
higher.

[**8-13**]: head CT: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of increase in
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Previously noted subarachnoid
hemorrhage is slightly evolved in the interval. 2. Normal
ventricular size with the drain extending to the third
ventricle. 3. Coiling in the region of anterior communicating
artery with an adjacent hypodensity as before.

[**8-7**]- pending  EEG :
This EEG telemetry from [**Date range (1) 87361**] showed persistent sleep
or medication-related patterns with no major change in frequency
or
voltage over the time of the recording. There were no
epileptiform
features.

[**8-14**] EEG
This monitoring of cerebral function from [**Date range (1) 10831**]/[**2118**]
showed a profoundly suppressed background at the beginning and
throughout the recording. There was no major asymmetry in
background
voltages. There were no epileptiform features or electrographic
seizures.

[**2119-8-15**] CTA head
1. Multifocal narrowing in the proximal course of the anterior
cerebral
arteries bilaterally adjacent to the anterior communicating
artery coiling
suggestive of vasospasm. The remaining intracranial vasculature
appears
unremarkable.
2. Stable subarachnoid hemorrhage.
3. Air-fluid levels in the paranasal sinuses.
4. There is again artifact seen from the prior coiling in the
region of the anterior communicating artery. There is stable
appearance to the surrounding hypodensity, ischemic changes
cannot be completely excluded, please correlate clinicallly.

[**2119-8-16**] EEG
 This monitoring of cerebral function from [**Date range (1) 61726**]/[**2118**]
showed a profoundly suppressed background throughout the
recording.
There was no major asymmetry in background voltages. There were
no
epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.

[**2119-8-18**] EEG
This EEG telemetry showed a slow and low voltage background
throughout. This indicates a widespread encephalopathy. The
record
appeared unchanged from earlier recordings in the last several
days.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.

[**2119-8-19**] CT head
Overall unchanged appearance of the ventricles. Other findings
as described above.

[**2119-8-20**] CT head
1. Status post removal of an external ventricular drain, without
evidence of hemorrhage in the tube tract.
2. Stable changed appearan
