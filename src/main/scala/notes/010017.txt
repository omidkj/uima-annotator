CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Weakness, rigors, acute mental status
change, melena.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
Chinese male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes,
and a history of recurrent kidney/bladder stones many years
ago who presents on [**2191-12-30**] with a chief complaint of four
days of malaise, chills, decreased p.o. intake.  He had seen
his PCP four days prior to admission with flu-like symptoms
and discharged with ciprofloxacin for presumed UTI.  He
presented the next day to the ED and got a chest x-ray,
diagnosed with a viral illness.  On [**2191-12-30**], he presented
back to the ED with new melena.  He was initially admitted to
[**Hospital1 139**] but then had new respiratory distress for which he was
intubated.  He was also found to be in acute renal failure
secondary to obstruction with right-sided hydronephrosis
secondary to a kidney stone.  He had a temperature to 104 and
was covered broadly with ceftazidime, Levaquin, vancomycin,
and Flagyl.  CT-guided percutaneous nephrostomy was placed by
Interventional Radiology.  The patient defervesced and
eventually blood were notable for ampicillin-sensitive
Enterococcus and his antibiotics were tailored accordingly.

An EGD was performed on [**2191-12-31**] notable for gastritis and
acute duodenal ulcers with evidence of acute bleed.  He was
found to be H. pylori positive and was started on PPI,
Clarithromycin.  The hematocrit had been stable throughout.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On transfer, hematocrit 40.1,
white count 13.7, down from 14.9, platelets 313,000.  The U/A
revealed a few bacteria, [**6-21**] white blood cells, trace
leukocyte esterase, large blood.  BUN an creatinine on
transfer 23, 1.4, glucose 108, INR 1.4.  Recent ABG on
[**2192-1-2**], status post extubation, 7.35/38/94.

Culture date from [**2192-1-2**] influenzae A and B negative.  On
[**2192-1-3**], urine culture pending.  C. difficile pending.  On
[**2191-12-31**] sputum consistent with yeast.  On [**2191-12-31**] H. pylori
antibody positive.  Blood cultures two out of two negative.
No growth to date.  On [**2191-12-30**], urine culture revealed three
types of bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to
ampicillin, levofloxacin, penicillin, and vancomycin on
[**2191-12-30**].  The [**2191-12-28**] urine with E. faecalis with similar
sensitivities.

Radiology x-rays on admission were negative.  On [**2191-12-30**],
mild CHF.  On [**2191-12-30**], ET tube intubated at appropriate
carinal height.  On [**2191-12-31**], CHF, alveolar edema, left lower
