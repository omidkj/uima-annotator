Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10842**]
Chief Complaint:
Pericardial effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Drainage of a pericardial effusion


History of Present Illness:
79 yo female with h/o COPD on home O2, HTN, HLP, DM,
osteoporosis, morbid obesity who presented to an OSH with
worsening SOB.  She had been treated with Z-pack without
benefit.  She continued to have worsening SOB throughout her
admission there.  She had an echocardiogram initially which
showed a pericardial effusion, which was fairly small without
any evidence of tamponade physiology, but she then had a repeat
echo cardiogram on [**11-5**] with which showed a large anterior and
posterior pericardial effusion which measured 17 mm in diastole
and 21 mm in systole.  She was then transferred for further
evaluation and potential pericardiocentesis.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2136-11-5**]
1) RV systolic function is decreased
2) A large anterior and posterior pericardial effusion is
present, posteriorly measuring 17 mm in diastole and 21 mm in
systole.

TTE [**11-8**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a large circumferential pericardial effusion
with a small layer (0.9 cm) echo dense material on the right
ventricle consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular
elements. No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. There
is brief right atrial diastolic collapse. The heart swings with
each cardiac cycle and the anterior echolucent pericardial
effusion varied between 2 cm and 0 cm. Apically, the effusion
varied between 2.1 cm and 0.8 cm.
IMPRESSION: Large circumferencial pericardial effusion with no
clear evidence of tamponade. There is significant cardiac motion
with variable local pericardial effusion size between cardiac
cycles.

Cath [**11-8**]: COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided pressures
and
equalization of of RA, PCW and pericardial pressures consistent
with
tamponade.
2. Subxiphoid pericardiocentesis removed 820 cc of bloody fluid.

Pericardial pressure fell to 2 mmHg with RA pressure of 8 mmHg.
Fluid
was sent for cytology, culture, and chemistries. Echo confirmed
pericardial effusion was now only small post-pericardiocentesis.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Large pericardial effsusion with tamponade physiology.
2. Successful pericardiocentesis with removal of 820 cc of
fluid.

Repeat TTE [**11-8**]:There is a small pericardial effusion (mostly
posterior to the LV).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-11-8**],
the amount of pericardial effusion has significantly decreased.


TTE [**11-9**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). with normal free wall contractility. There is a
small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
IMPRESSION: Very small residual echodense pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-11-8**],
pericardial effusion size has further decreased.

TTE [**11-10**]: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is
abnormal septal motion/position. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a small pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small pericardial effusion, located posterior to the
right atrium without evidence of tamponade. There is a septal
bounce seen which could be consistent with effusive-constrictive
pericardial disease.
Compared with the prior stud
