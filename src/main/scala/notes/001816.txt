Chief Complaint:
chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cathetherization


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 2127**] [**Known lastname 4612**] is a 81 yo female with a past medical history of
CAD with a 1 vessel CABG (SVG to LAD) in [**2134**] who presents with
chest pressure.  She woke up at 8 am with substernal chest
pressure.  It was severe initially.  She took SL NTG x3 with
relief of CP for a short period of time.  The CP radiated to her
right side and eventually down both arms.  She reports
diaphoresis, but denied associated nausea, vomiting,
lightheadedness or dizziness.  She reports that she has felt
mildly SOB since her recent pneumonia (first diagnosed appox [**6-24**]
weeks ago).  She denied worsening dyspnea.  Her cough has
improved substantially and is very minimal at this time.  She
went to her PCP's office and was found to have a new LBBB and
anterior ST elevations.  She was transferred to the ED. She
received Plavix 300mg, Aspirin, boluses of heparin and
integrillin. Code STEMI was called and went to the cath lab.
Cath showed occluded SVG, Native 3vd, occluded proximal LAD.
Wiring the LAD was difficult and there was concern about a
possible dissection. One BMS was placed in the proximal LAD.
Distal LAD is diminutive past 1st septal and diag branches.
She has been hemodynamically stable with HR 60-70s and SBP
120-130s.  On the floor, she is currently chest pain free and
feels well.
.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 2127**] [**Known lastname 4612**] is a 81 yo female with a history of CAD who
presented with an STEMI s/p catheterization and was incidentally
found to have multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with
adenocarcinoma.

#. STEMI: Pt presented with an anterior STEMI.  Her TIMI risk
score was 7 indicating a 41% risk at 14 days of mortality, new
or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent
revascularization.  Her SVG found to be completely occluded and
a BMS was placed in the proximal LAD.  Due to the timing of the
SVG placement over 20 years ago, it was thought that her LAD had
managed to self revascularize and was partially supplied by the
RCA.  She was started on routine ACS medications: eptifibatide
for 18 hrs, plavix 75 and aspirin 325mg, metoprolol, captopril,
and atorvastatin.  Cardiac enzymes trended down appropriately
with peak Ck and CKMB at 107 and 18.2.  There was concern for
acute heart failure from ischemic insult oxygen requirement.
However, she was noted to also have a RLL pneumonia and no
significant pulmonary edema (see below).  ECHO showed moderate
to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
anterior and anterospetal akinesis and inferior/inferolateral
hypokinesis.  Initially, patient  was started on coumadin for
ventricular thrombus prophylaxis, but this was subsequantly
discontinued as risk of bleeding outweighed benefit.

# Hypoxia:  Upon hospitalization, patient was maintaing
saturations in low 90s on 6L from baseline 92% on RA.  CXR
showed RLL pneumonia, and patient was subsequantly started on
ceftriaxone, azithromycin, metronidazole.  As the patient had
history recurrent RLL pneumonia, a CT scan was obtained which
showed severe right lower lobe consolidation and extensive, new
diffuse lung nodules with  sputum cytology positive for
adenocarcinoma.  Hypoxia was initially felt to be a combination
of postobstructive pneumonia and tumor burden from
adenocarcinoma.  Antibiotics were changed to vancomycin,
levofloxacin and flagyl of which she completed a 10 day course.
Repeat CT scan showed little interval improvement in right lower
lobe infiltrate.  Respiratory status remained tenuous, patient
requiring high flow O2 with 6LNC with desaturations to high 70s
with activity.  Prior to discharge O2 requirement was 5L by
nasal cannula.  She was breathing comfortably with oxygen
saturation in the low 90s.  Likely this will continue to be
necessary for some time.  A shovel mask may be used to assist
with oxygenation as needed.

# Lung nodules/ Broncheoalveolar carcinoma: CT scan with diffuse
pulmonary nodules and sputum cytology positive for
adenocarcinoma.  Etiology was felt to be primary
bronchioalveolar vs metastatic thyroid dx (prior dx of possible
microfollicular carcinoma) although routine cancer screening was
not up-to-date.  A tissue diagnosis was not attained given the
patient's high oxygen requirement and anticoagulation with
plavix/asa in the setting of recent BMS placement.  Although
patient did not have imaging of her head, staging based on CT
torso was IIIa with pulmonary nodules in both lung fields
without obvious distal LAD or metastasis.  Empiric therapy with
single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] chemotherapy was initiated on [**1-7**] with
Pemetrexed.  She tolerated this well.  She received
dexamethasone on [**1-8**] to prevent rash.

# Chronic renal insufficiency - Patient with GFR 48.
Medications were renally dosed and renal function was carefully
followed.  She was treated prophylactically with mucomyst prior
to and post IV contrast dose.  Creatinine remained stable at
1-1.1.

# Hyperkalemia:  The patient was mildly hyperkalemic the day
prior to discharge to 5.6 without EKG changes.   This responded
promptly to kayexalate.  Electrolytes should be checked daily
until stable.  If necessary ACEI could be stopped.

# HTN:  She was normotensive on ACEI and b-blocker.
