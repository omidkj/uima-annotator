Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 17865**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is 62 year old male with history of transverse myelitis
complicated by paraplegia who presents with two days of
shortness of breath. The patient has had a complicated recent
history involving a leg fracture sustained while moving in his
wheel chair. This was not treated surgically. He also has a
sacral decub which was treated with 2 weeks of cipro then 2
weeks of levofloxacin. Over the past two days he has been having
increasing shortness of breath. He has oxygen at home which he
normally does not use. He has been using up to 4L 1 day PTA. He
reports no fevers of chills. He has been taking his temp and no
documented fevers. He does not endorse ant chest pain. His wife
notes that although his right leg is constantly swollen from the
fracture, his left leg has been having increasing swelling over
the past few days. His wife also notes that he has been
increasingly lethargic over the past few days as well.

In the ED, he recieved Vanc and Zosyn.  CTA neg for PE but
showed no central PE but Bibasal GGO and more consolidative opc
w/enlarged subcarinal [**Last Name (un) **] ? pna.

Upon arrival to the floor his sats were in the 80s on NC and he
required a NRB to attain sats in the 90s. An ABG was performed
7.49/44/141. He was given 20mg IV lasix. He was eventually able
to be placed on a 40% venturi mask. His oral temp was 99.7. He
was short of breath when not on the NRB.

ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR,
melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

IMAGING

 CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2164-2-14**]
2:22 PM
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Progressed interstitial lung disease including honeycombing,
cylindrical bronchiectasis, and diffuse ground-glass
opacification predominantly in the lower lobes. Nonspecific
interstitial pneumonia is a primary diagnostic consideration,
with the possibility of superimposed aspiration suggested
particularly in light of the patulous esophagus. Although
unlikely given age, connective tissue disease may also present
in this manner. It would be atypical however to present at this
advanced age.
3. Meidastinal adenopathy. Given relative dramatic sizes, felt
out of
proportion to be reactive nodes. Follow up CT in [**2-3**] months
recommended to
further evaluate.
4. Large hiatal hernia with patulous esophagus. Contributes to
possibility
of superimposed aspiration.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2164-2-15**] at 11:13:00 AM  FINAL
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging
suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation. There appears to be a mass
that is external to the lateral and posterior sides of the right
atrium. This mass is indenting/compressing the right atrium
without causing hemodynamic compromise. This is probably the
same mass/lymhpadenopathy seen on the recent chest CT.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT Study Date of [**2164-2-15**] 8:04 AM
Limited study. Deep venous thrombosis in the left proximal and
mid femoral vein.

TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) RIGHT Study Date of [**2164-2-15**] 5:49 PM
Angulated and minimally displaced fractures involving the
proximal metaphyses of the tibia and fibula.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2164-2-21**] 11:00 AM
In comparison with the study of [**2-19**], there is little interval
change. Again there is striking dilatation of the
tracheobronchial tree.
Bibasilar areas of opacification persist, consistent with
consolidation
superimposed upon underlying interstitial lung disease.




Brief Hospital Course:
62M quadraparetic s/p transverse myelitis, sent to ICU from
floor for hypoxia and closer monitoring/nursing care.

# Hypoxia: CTA r/o PE but showed mostly dependent ground glass
opacity and concern for aspiration pneumonia pneumonitis vs CAP
vs ILD (less likely as spares apices) vs pulmonary edema.
Leukocytosis of 16.4, lactate 1.1.  He was initially started on
broad spectrum antibiotics including Vanco/Zosyn/Levaquin.
These were narrowed to Levoquin / Vanco on [**2-21**] given no
cultures had grown out.  The exact etiology of his hypoxia
remained somewhat unclear throughout his hospitalization but is
likely multifactorial including interstitial disease, likely
silent aspiration and anxiety.  He was started on steroids while
inpatient, with plan to have this tapered by his primary care.

# LE Edema: Pt with notable LE edema upon exam which by report
was new.  Bilateral, with some erythema which could represent
venous stasis vs cellulitis.  Ultrasound revealed DVT in his
left leg.  He was started on a heparin drip for this while
inpatient.  Upon discharge, continued anticoagulation was
discussed with his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Lovenox
was not a reasonable option due to his minimal subcutaneous fat.
 He was also taking minimal oral intake.  Given this, his PCP
recommended discharged without anticoagulation but plan to
consider it should his underlying poor health status change.

# Sacral decubiti: Multiple sacral decubiti, with some concern
of osteomyelitis per wife. Was [**Name2 (NI) 38511**] with levaquin as
outpatient, scheduled for Plastics evaluation as oupatient prior
to admission.  Was seen by Wound Care and Plastics who left
recommendations but did not think surgi
