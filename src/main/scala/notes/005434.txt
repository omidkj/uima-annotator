Chief Complaint:
bloody stool

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD


History of Present Illness:
68 y/o female with reecent ishemic colitis necessitating
emergent subtotal colectomy with terminal ileostomy last montyh
now presents with bloody stool and melena.  On presentation, her
hct was 40 without hemodynamic instability, but with acute renal
failure, nongap metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis with 25% bands.
 EGD demonstrated grade II mid to distal esophagitis with
gastritis, and [**Location (un) 3825**] ulcers in the hiatal hernia.  INR was 6.3
several days prior and she received one injection of vitamin K.
Here INR was <2.  She received an additional SC injection of vit
K, 2 units PRBC.  Seen by [**Doctor First Name **] who does not feel that GI bleed
is related to recent surgery or additional ischemic gut with
bleed.
  She reports occasional shortness of breath and nonprductive
cough.  Denies fevre, chilss, chest pain, rigors, abdominal
pain.  CXR had ? infiltrate in LLL but film quality is poor.
Mid-line incision healing well without evidence of infection

RADIOLOGY:
CT, ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION
1. Stranding of the fat surrounding the tail of the pancreas
with a small linear fluid collection with enhancing margins and
scattered foci of air extending from this region to the
rectosigmoid stump. The fluid tracts in close position to
adjacent bowel loops, and is not ammenable to percutaneous
drainage.
2. There are scattered foci of air seen in this region. The
source of air is unclear. This could represent an infectious
process, or as described above, could be secondary to visous
perforation, or a fistulous process, as described above.

CT, CHEST W/CONTRAST:
No significantly enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph
nodes are seen. There is a tiny pericardial effusion seen. The
previously seen small left-sided pleural effusion is unchanged.
There is a small amount of bibasilar atelectasis, unchanged.
Again seen, is slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature
with associated ground glass opacity suggesting pulmonary edema.
This is unchanged. The degree of bibasilar consolidation is
unchanged, and the differential for this remains as atelectasis
vs. pneumonia.

CXR:
AP & lateral chest. Cardiovascular status difficult to assess in
this large patient with high diaphragms and bedside technique.
Borderline cardiomegaly with no vascular congestion. There is a
left basal process with atelectasis and possible consolidation
which has increased in extent since exam 1 day previous. I
cannot exclude a small associated pleural effusion on this side.
Remainder of lungs clear. Thoracic scoliosis convex right.
Partially visualized IVC filter.

VIDEO SWALLOW, [**2167-12-18**]: Silent aspiration worse than prior now
requiring honey-thickened fluids and purre foods.  Needs chin
tuck and 1:1 feeding assistance for all meals.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 y/o female with GIB bleed noted to have acute renal failure
and metabolic acidosis. Hospital course outlined by problem
below.

##UGIB:  EGD demonstrated severe esophagitis and gastritis with
small, shallow [**Location (un) 3825**] ulcers in a hiatal hernia.  IT is
conceivable that she could bleed from these sites in the setting
of her supratherapeutic INR.  She remained hemodynamically
stable and her Hct dropped minimally, largely related to
hemodilution from volume resucitation with ivf.  She received a
total of two units of PRBC and had no further episodes of
bleeding.  She was observed in the MICU for 24 hours then
transferred to the floor where she remained without any
complication. Patient was restarted on a low dose of coumadin
prior to dc.  Frequent INR checks should be made to ensure an
acceptable range of [**12-24**]. She should take Protonix 40mg PO twice
daily for one month, then swithch to once daily dosing for a
lifetime.  This will be for asymptomatic esophagitis as well as
to prevent NSAID gastropathy with additional GIB.

##acute renal failure: She presented with acute renal failure
without any symptoms of uremia.  This rapidly resolved with iv
hydration and was likely related to her blood loss with impaired
renal perfusion.  Her non-gap metabolic acidosis could not be
explained by her renal failure alone.  She was given bicarb
repletion.  It was felt that she was losing large amounts of
bicarb from high stool output.  Her bicarb returned to [**Location 213**]
within 2 days and her bicarb replacement was stopped.  She was
started on imodium and it is recommended that she receive foods
that have a low osmotic load (foods that do not have a lot of
sugar), and eat frequent small meals rather than a few large
ones.  She does not have a renal tubular acidosis as she has no
risk factors for them, has a normal potassium, an appropriately
acidic urine pH that did not rise with bicarb repletion. Her
bicarb losses are attributed to GI losses from her ostomy bag.

##bandemia:  She had a mild cough with occasional SOB but
remained afebrile.  She was started on broad spec antibiotics
with a good response of decreasing leukocytosis.  She remained
afebrile throughout her hospital stay with no respiratory
failure.  CXR demonstrated left lower lobe opacity.  CT chest
showed small pleural effusion and small area of consolidation in
the left lower lobe.  She was transitioned to PO antibiotics
before discharge. She should be treated for two weeks total
course.
   Prior to her last discharge in [**2167-10-21**], she did have an
unexplained bandemia for which she was treated with antibiotics
and sent to rehab.  An abdominal CT at that time showed no
evidence of an abscess or enteritis.  Repeat CT on this
admission demonstrated small amounts of air with peripancreatic
stranding suggestive of infection vs. postsurgical changes.  She
remained without any abdominal pain.  Surgery was consulted who
felt no need for intervention at this time. She will follow up
as an outpatient. Also an anuerysm was seen on the CT and
patient should follow up with vascular surgery.
  Blood and urine cultures grew no bacteria.  Urine suggested a
yeast UTI but b/c she was asymptomat
