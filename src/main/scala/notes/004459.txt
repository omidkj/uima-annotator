abdominal pain, hyperglycemia

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] is a 33y/o gentleman with poorly controlled DM1
complicated by gastroparesis and h/o DKA in the past, ESRD on
HD, HTN and nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30-35%) who presented
to the ED with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting in the
setting of hyperglycemia.
.
He reports that his blood sugars have been reasonably controlled
this week (<160) but he also admits that he has not checked his
fingerstick at home since the day prior to admission.  Yesterday
he tool his standing Lantus 18U in the AM, and then a total of
20 units of sliding scale Humalog.  The last fingerstick he took
was 160.  He awoke this morning feeling "sick to my stomach,"
with abdominal pain and he vomited a small amount of nonbloody
fluid.  He continued to have abdominal pain and vomited a few
more times so he came to the ED.
.
The pain is a diffuse, burning epigastric pain that is
associated with nausea and vomiting.  It is similar to his prior
episodes of gastroparesis and DKA.  No RUQ pain.  He denies any
fevers/chills. No cough/URI symptoms.  He still makes a small
amount of urine but has had no dysuria and no change in the
color of his urine.  No flank pain.  No erythema or redness from
his RUE AVF.  No skin rashes.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 99.4, HR 101, BP 123/73, RR
18, POx 100% RA.  He was vomiting and appeared volume depleted
on exam and had diffuse abdominal tenderness but no acute
abdomen.  Labs revealed glucose 673, anion gap 21, pH 7.39.
Potassium 5.2 so received no potassium.  He received regular
insulin 10U then was started on regular insulin drip at 7U/hr.
Received 1L/hr for 3 hours (total 3L before transfer to ICU) and
still remained tachycardic.  For abdomminal pain, received
Morphine 4mg IV; no imaging was obtained in the ED.  Was given
Zofran 8mg IV and Compazine 10mg IV.  Vital signs prior to
transfer were T 99.3, HR 104, BP 182/108, RR 18, POx 96% RA.
.
On the floor, he complains of abdominal pain but says it is a
[**5-17**] (compared to 17/10 on admission).  No nausea right now but
starts to feel nauseated if talking for a long time.  Very
thirsty and asking for ice chips.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] is a 33 y/o gentleman with HTN and DM1 presenting
with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting in the setting of
hyperglycemia that are consistent with prior episodes of
gastroparesis and DKA.
.
#. Hyperglycemia/DKA: The patient presented in DKA with a blood
sugar of 673 and an AG of 21. The patient has a h/o questionable
med adherance and DKA.  He was palced on an insulin gtt and
electrolytes were followed. The patient improved with good FS
and his gap fell to 13.  Troponin elevated but without CK-MB
elevations; findings likely a result of ESRD.  EKG without
evidence of AMI.  On arrival in the MICU, the patient's FS was
215.  Drip was d/c'ed and started on ISS.  On AM of [**7-31**], the
patient was still with FS in the 200s and had reopened a gap to
17.  ISS was increased without change in the anion gap despite
normal blood sugars, this persistant gap was thought likely [**2-9**]
renal failure and accumulation of organic acids.  Patient has
had multiple admissions in the past year for similar complaints,
patient's primary physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Patient asked
specifically that we not get [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult as it costs him
$300 each admission and he will follow up as an outpatient.
.
#. Abdominal pain: On arrival the paient complained of
burning/fullness likely as a result of DKA, gastroparesis and
abdominal wall tenderness from vomiting. This is similar to the
pain he has had in the past in the setting of poorly controlled
blood sugars.  Associated with nausea.  The pain and nausea were
controlled with zofran, reglan, APAP and dilaudid.  Reports that
abd pain is greatly improved on AM of [**8-1**].  Patinet has a [**Company 191**]
narcotics contract that states he will not recieve more than [**2-11**]
mg Diluadid PO twice daily.
.
#. HTN: The patient has a h/o poorly controlled BP.  Home meds
currently include Carvedilol, Amlodipine and Lisinopril.  In the
MICU, the patient's pressures were initially elevated to the
200/110s range.  Received home meds and labetolol overnight with
good improvement.  On [**7-31**], BPs are controlled with home meds to
130s systolic.
.
#. ESRD: The patient has ESRD on HD.  Last HD was [**7-30**] he is a
on a TTS schedule.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

patient cannot afford and will follow up as an outpatient
