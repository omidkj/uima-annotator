Chief Complaint:
fall


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NG tube


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 87 year old female s/p ? mechanical fall with
head contusion.  Taken to [**Hospital6 1597**] where she had a
head CT which showed bilateral SDH.  Pet [**Hospital3 2568**] reports, she
was confused and slow to follow commands.  As a result, she was
intubated for airway protection and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Brief Hospital Course:
87 y/o F s/p fall presents with bilateral SDHs, bifrontal
contusions, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular
hemorrhage.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# MECHANICAL FALL C/B INTRACRANIAL HEMATOMAS: She was admitted
to the neurosurgery with bilateral SDHs, bifrontal contusions,
subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular bleed S/P
mechanical fall and placed in the ICU for close monitoring. She
was started on dilantin. On examination, patient was slightly
confused, but alert to place and name. She was moving all
extremities with good strength. On [**10-1**], repeat head CT was
performed which showed blossoming of bifrontal contusions and
stable SDHs with SAH and IVH. She remained in the ICU for close
monitoring with a stable exam. Dilantin level was 12.9. On [**10-2**]
the patient had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] level of alertness, only
responsive to noxious stimuli at times. She was sent for a
repeat CT of the head which showed a minimally increased
hematoma and no evidence of herniation. When the patient was
transferred to medicine on [**2169-10-4**], she was sleepy but roused to
verbal commands and oriented only to self. Though she could
repeat "[**Hospital3 **]", she did not know that this was a hospital.
Her neurologic exam on [**10-5**] changed to show a flattening of the
left nasolabial fold. A repeat study on the 23rd showed evidence
of right subdural hematoma expansion with midline shift. The
brainstem was not compromised.

# Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia: The patient was held NPO with
minimal IVF. Her serum sodium slowly trended up and her
potassium slowly trended down. On [**10-4**], the patient was
transferred to the medicine service for management of a Na of
157 and a K of 2.5. The patient's free water deficit was
calculated at approximately 2.5 liters and with the aid of a
nephrology consult, her sodium was corrected slowly so as to
avoid any intracranial edema in the setting of six already known
bleeds. She was corrected at less than 0.5 mEq/L/hr. Her
potassium was also repleted.

# Atrial fibrillation: the patient was found to be in new atrial
fibrillation on [**2169-10-4**] when she was transferred to the medicine
service. This was thought likely due to her low intravascular
volume status with possible contribution from her severe
electrolyte disturbances. Her medication regimen was changed and
she responded very well to PO metoprolol, mostly remaining in
sinus afterwards. Further episodes of atrial fibrillation
responded very well to IV metoprolol.

# Tachypnea: On approximately 1230 on [**10-5**], the patient's
respiratory rate abruptly increased to the mid 30s and her
oxygen saturation dropped to the 50s. This increased to the 80s
with a non-rebreather, but her tachypnea did not respond. She
was seen immediately by the medical team. Her lungs were clear
at the time and NG tube yielded only scant dark liquid. A stat
chest X ray showed clear lungs, which corroborated the exam.
Therefore acute cardiac decompensation was ruled out. It was
thought most likely that she had had a massive pulmonary
embolism despite her heparin prophylaxis. The possibility of an
expansion of one of her six head bleeds was also entertained,
but considered less likely given her tachypnea. Her sodium had
been corrected very slowly to avoid any cerebral edema and CT
head confirmed this. Although the patient may have aspirated,
the sudden and dramatic desaturation with the most recent PO
intake having been a small amount of tea and broth several hours
earlier that morning made this unlikely. The primary team had
extensive discussion with the family and the decision was made
to transition the patient to comfort measures only. Her oxygen
hunger was treated with morphine and benzodiazepines. She died
on the morning of [**2169-10-6**].
