History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname **] is a 78-year-old G4P30013 Taiwanese female with
history of aortic stenosis and HTN, who initially presented to
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2166-12-16**] with complaint of worsening
fatigue, early satiety, increasing abdominal distention and
discomfort, and constipation alternating with diarrhea. The
patient denied any associated fevers, chills, cough, shortness
of breath, dyspnea on exertion or headaches. On [**2166-12-16**], the patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.
This study revealed moderate diffuse abdominal and pelvic
ascites. In addition, the omentum was noted to be thickened and
somewhat nodular.  There was an asymmetric fullness of the left
adnexa.

The patient was admitted to the medical service for further
evaluation.  On [**2166-12-17**], the patient underwent a
diagnostic paracentesis. 1.5 liters of cloudy, yellow fluid was
removed and sent for the appropriate studies.  Serum CA 125
level was found to be elevated at 746. CEA is 1.8.  Cytology
from the peritoneal fluid is pending.

On [**2166-12-19**], the patient underwent a second
paracentesis.  She noted a mild improvement of her symptoms
after the paracentesis, however now reports increasing
discomfort due to further abdominal distention.

The patient is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

[**2166-12-17**] Peritoneal fluid: Albumin was 1.8, LDH was [**Telephone/Fax (1) 43426**]
nucleated cells of which on preliminary analysis many appeared
malignant. Final cytology pending.
.
[**2166-12-19**] Cell block, peritoneal fluid: Mesothelial cells,
lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes and red blood cells.
Cytology pending.

[**2166-12-24**] Pathology report from mesenteric biopsy: Burkitt's.
.
[**2166-12-26**] Bone Marrow:
Peripheral Blood Smear:
The smear is adequate for evaluation.  Erythrocytes demonstrate
anisopoikilocytosis.  They appear to have increased central
pallor, with scattered polychromatophils present.  Abnormal
forms including target cells, ecchinocytes, and elliptocytes are
also present.  The white blood cell count appears normal.
Platelet count appears normal with rare clumping.  Large forms
are seen.  Differential count shows 69% neutrophils, 5%
monocytes, 2%lymphocytes, 1% basophils, 3% atypical mononuclear
cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles within deep blue cytoplasm.
.
Aspirate Smear:
The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and shows
several cellular spicules with many stripped nuclei.  The M:E
ratio is 0.9:1.  Erythroid precursors are present in mildly
megaloblastoid maturation.  Myeloid precursors appear normal in
number and show left shifted maturation.  Megakaryocytes are
present in decreased numbers.  Differential shows: 3% Blasts, 1%
Promyelocytes, 12% Myelocytes, 14% Metamyelocytes, 14%
Bands/Neutrophils, 13% Plasma cells, 16% Lymphocytes, 35%
Erythroid.  There are foamy hemosiderin laden macrophages
present in the smear.  There are large cells with intensely blue
cytoplasm with vacuoles.
.
Biopsy Slides:
The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and demonstrates
a fragmented cellular core (overall cellularity of 20-30%).
There are increased plasma cells and mast cells.  There is an
eosinophilic background.  The M:E ratio estimate is decreased.
Erythroid precursors are increased in number and show
normoblastic maturation.  Myeloid elements are relatively
decreased in number and exhibit full spectrum maturation.
Megakaryocytes are present in normal number.  There is an
interstitial infiltrate of plasma cells occurring in small
clusters occupying 20% of marrow cellularity.  Marrow clot
section is not submitted.  Touch prep is not submitted.
.
Special Stains:
Iron stain is adequate for evaluation.  Storage iron is
increased.  Sideroblasts are present.  Ring sideroblasts are
absent.

.
EKG: sinus rhythm, HR 80, normal axis, normal intervals, non
pathologic q-waves in II, III, aVF. [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in III.
.
RADIOGRAPHIC DATA:
CXR [**2166-12-22**]: There is some hyperexpansion of the lungs with
coarseness of interstitial markings consistent with chronic
pulmonary disease. Apical pleural thickening bilaterally, more
prominent on the right, consistent with old granulomatous
disease. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular
congestion, or pleural effusion. Loss of height of a mid dorsal
vertebra, most likely on a postmenopausal basis.
.
CT CHEST [**2166-12-19**]:
1. CALCIFIED SCARRING AT THE LUNG APICES. CALCIFIED MEDIASTINAL
LYMPH NODES. CALCIFICATIONS IN THE LIVER AND SPLEEN. THESE
FINDINGS ARE SUGGESTIVE OF CHRONIC TUBERCULOSIS OR ANOTHER
CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS INFECTION.
2. BILATERAL CALCIFIED PLEURAL PLAQUES, WHICH ARE MOST LIKELY
ALSO RELATED TO A CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS INFECTION. HOWEVER,
ASBESTOS EXPOSURE [**Month (only) **] ALSO BE CONSIDERED, AND CLINICAL
CORRELATION IS SUGGESTED.
3. SMALL BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS.
4. ABDOMINAL ASCITES, WHICH WAS BETTER ASSESSED ON THE [**2166-12-16**]
ABDOMINAL CT SCAN.
5. 9 MM LUCENT LESION IN THE LEFT GLENOID WITHOUT AGGRESSIVE
FEATURES, WHICH MOST LIKELY REPRESENTS A SUBCHONDRAL CYST.
HOWEVER, A
METASTASIS CANNOT ENTIRELY BE EXCLUDED, AND A BONE SCAN [**Month (only) **] BE
CONSIDERED.
6. MODERATE COMPRESSION DEFORMITIES OF THE VERTEBRAL BODIES OF
T7 AND
T12, OF UNKNOWN CHRONICITY.
