Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 43 yo woman with h/o morbid obesity, COPD, OSA,
and recent PE on Coumadin, who presents with a two-week history
of worsening dyspnea and productive cough.  The patient states
that her symptoms began at the end of [**Month (only) 404**], when she "caught
a cold" from her mother.  She has a history of asthma, and she
states that she subsequently developed increasing shortness of
breath, wheezing, and a cough productive of clear-brown sputum.
She increased the duration of her nebulizations but states that
this did not help her symptoms.  She also states that she has
been experiencing subjective fevers, loose stools, and
increasing lower and upper extremity edema for the past week.
She also admits to PND and increasing DOE.  She is now only able
to walk a few steps before becoming short of breath.  She was
prescribed Lasix 20 mg daily at her rehab facility, as needed
for peripheral edema, but she hasn't taken this since being
discharged from rehab 3 weeks ago.  She thus presented to the ED
for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, the patient's initial VS were T 98.6, BP 162/106, P
111, R 24-30, O2 83% on 5L (she normally wears 5L at home).  She
was placed on BiPap, and her O2 sats increased to 100%.  She had
diffuse expiratory wheezes on physical exam but no peripheral
edema.  CXR showed cardiomegaly, and EKG did not show evidence
of ST-T wave abnormalities.  She was given Prednisone 60 mg PO,
Magnesium 2 g IV, 3 Combivent nebulizations, Ceftriaxone, and
Azithromycin.  She was then started on a heparin gtt at 1200U/h
for possible PE, given the fact that she was likely over the
weight limit for the CT scanner.  She was then admitted to the
MICU for further workup and evaluation.  At the time of
transfer, her VS were BP 142/79, P 85, R 18, O2 97% on BiPAP.
.
On the floor, the patient continues to complain of shortness of
breath and states that she has to go to the bathroom.
Otherwise, she has no new complaints.
.

.
[**2-19**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2122-9-22**] there is no diagnostic interim change.
.
[**2-19**] CXR: Cardiomegaly with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates,
consistent with pulmonary edema.
.
[**2-22**] TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-9-21**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
.
[**2-23**] Skin pathology: pending.
.
[**2-24**] CXR: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged
including cardiomegaly, moderate in severity. Compared to
[**2-21**] and [**2-22**], there is interval improvement in
pulmonary edema with currently only minimal vascular engorgement
and upper lobe redistribution present. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. Right basilar opacity is slightly
asymmetric but most likely represents residual pulmonary edema,
although focus of infection cannot be excluded and should be
further followed with radiographs to document complete
resolution.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 43 y/o woman with h/o COPD, recent PE, and
pulmonary HTN, who presents with a 3-day history of worsening
dyspnea and hypoxia, believed to be due to a CHF exacerbation
(in the setting of lasix noncompliance). At home, patient
uses 5L NC.
.
#. Dyspnea: Believed due to a CHF exacerbation (right heart
failure vs acute diastolic heart failure) given her lasix
non-compliance, peripheral edema, CXR, and the fact that she has
now improved to her baseline breathing status after 11 kg
diuresis in the MICU. The patient was initially treated for COPD
exacerbation with steroids, antibiotics, and diuresis. She did
not have leukocytosis or fevers, and antibiotics and steroids
were discontinued, out of the belief that her respiratory
symptoms were predominantly the result of fluid overload. She
diuresed excellently to moderate doses of furosemide, and her
length-of-stay fluid balance was negative 21 liters, by [**2-24**].
