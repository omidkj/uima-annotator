Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
84yo PMHx rectal cancer s/p resection and XRT w ostomy, systolic
CHF (LVEF40-45%), recent trach/peg who presented with
respiratory distress, found to have a pnuemonia, with blood and
sputum cultures growing out MRSA, now improved to baseline
respiratory status being discharged to MACU on 2 week course of
IV antibioitics
.
ACTIVE
# Healthcare Associated Pnuemonia and MRSA Bacteremia - Patient
presented with increasing O2 requirements, leukocytosis and
hypotension; CXR demonstrated LLL PNA; accompanying elevated
Lactate, High SvO2 (93%), hypotension and tachycardia suggested
sepsis; blood and sputum cultures grew out MRSA.  Patient was
initially fluid resuscitated and briefly required vasopressors.
He was treated with vancomycin (initially with cefepime and
levofloxacin as well, which were stopped based upon culture
data).  Patient respiratory status improved, and patient was
able to be weaned off vent to trach collar.  Given MRSA
bacteremia, patient had PICC line changed and underwent TTE that
did not demonstrate signs of valvular lesions; patient was
planned for 2 week course with IV vancomycin.
.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer: Significant, likely stage IV.
Appropriate wound care was provided and his pain regimen was
increased to Oxycodone to 5-10 mg q4 PRN for pain which
successfully curbed decubitus pain.
.
# Coronary artery disease: Stable, continued carvedilol; held
lisinopril given hypotension and will need to be restarted;
started ASA (had been held previously given history of GI
bleeds).
.
# Afib: CHADS4, but off anticoagulation [**2-16**] hemothorax 6/[**2163**].
Discussed with primary cardiologist who recommended considering
restarting [**Year (4 digits) **] as outpatient.

INACTIVE
# Anemia - Continued iron supplementation
.
# Systolic CHF: EF 40-45%, continued lasix
.
Transitional Issues:
- Patient is full code
- Will need primary care doctors to discuss [**Name5 (PTitle) **] as
outpatient
- Continue vancomycin for 2 weeks total course
