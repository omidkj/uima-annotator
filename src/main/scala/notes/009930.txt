Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Code Sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Incision and drainage of L foot X 2
L ankle/foot external fixation


History of Present Illness:
 Patient is a 74 year old male with a history of Left foot
Charcot neuroarthropathy and chronic ulcerations with multiple
surgeries for debridement and bone removal for osteomyelitis. He
has had numerous treatment including 50 hyperbaric oxygen
chamber treatments and numerous courses of antibiotics although
which ones are not well delineated in the medical record. The
patient has been hospitalized 3 times in the last year, most
recently [**2136-5-25**] to [**2136-5-29**] for correction of a loose left
external fixator. During this hospitalization he was started on
Vanco/Levo/Flagyl empirically. External fixator was surgically
removed and wound swabs revealed MRSA for which the patient was
maintained on Vancomycin during the hospitalization, and
subsequently discharged on [**2136-5-29**] to Rehab with a 4 week
course of Linezolid.
.
The patient now was seen in the E.D. after being sent from the
[**Hospital **] clinic with concern for an infected foot. Per podiatry
notes, patient's left foot was noted to be very swollen with
purulent and sanguinous drainage. Patient reports some
nausea/vomiting one week prior and additionally endorses some
chills this a.m. as well as increasing pain in his foot over the
last three weeks. Unfortunately the patient is unable to recall
with good detail his recent medical course, but per his report,
after his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**], he was D/C to rehab and
recently returned home 3 weeks ago with home PT where he felt he
was doing relatively well. Per his report he completed
antibiotics on Tuesday although he is unsure if this was the
previously prescribed Linezolid or a different medication. The
patient was scheduled to be seen in clinic two weeks ago but
this was delayed for undefined reasons.
.
In the E.D. the patient's vitals were T - 97.5, HR 90, BP
119/63, RR 18, O2 sat 98% (? O2 flow). Per report the patient
had an episode of afib with RVR with normalization of HR with
volume resuscitation of 2.5L prior to transfer without nodal
agents. In the E.D. the patient received Levo/Flagyl/Vanc. A
code sepsis was called, a right IJ placed and the patient was
transferred to the MICU for ongoing care.

AP, LATERAL, AND OBLIQUE VIEWS OF THE LEFT FOOT: No localizing
history is available.

The study is technically limited as the patient was not able to
rotate for the mortise and oblique views.

The patient is status post charcot foot reconstruction with left
fibular osteotomy, tibial calcaneal arthrodesis and left
talectomy with femoral head allograft placement. There has been
continued interval remodeling at the site of the femoral
allograft. Circular lucencies seen on the prior film, which
represented location of removal of prior hardware are not well
seen on today's exam consistent with new bone formation in these
locations. The joint spaces in the mid foot are less
well-defined on today's exam, which may be partly due to the
differences in patient rotation of the foot but may also be due
to continued bony destruction and remodeling in the mid foot.
Extensive resorption of the second through fifth metatarsal and
proximal third phalanx degenerations are again noted and are
consistent with prior infection or changes secondary to
neuropathy. Diffuse periosteal reaction along the medial aspect
of the fibula is unchanged. No acute fractures are seen. The
bone stimulation device remains in place. There is extensive
vascular calcification, unchanged. No definite gas is seen in
the soft tissues.

IMPRESSION:
1. No definite evidence of gas within the soft tissues. Density
irregularity at the dorsum of the foot may be due to skin folds.
Clinical correlation is recommended.
2. Evaluation of osteomyelitis is severely limited by the
extensive bony remodeling that is continuously taking place over
the course of multiple prior radiographs.

PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CHEST:

A left subclavian central venous catheter is in unchanged
position with the tip projecting over the brachiocephalic
junction. No pneumothorax is seen. The heart is normal in size.
Mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. No
pulmonary edema, consolidations or pleural effusions are seen.
There are stable bilateral pleural plaques.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. Stable bilateral
pleural plaques.
.
[**8-2**] LE U/S
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity.
2. Several moderately sized lymph nodes in the left groin, which
could be related to the patient's cellulitis. Please correlate
clinically.
.
[**8-8**] ECHO
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
The patient
appears to be in sinus rhythm.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no left
ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.  Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined.  There is no pericardial effusion.
