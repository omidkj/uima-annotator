Pertinent Results:
[**2196-4-18**] Echo: Pre-bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-16**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened with bileaflet retractions. The posterior leaflet is
more severely retracted than the anterior leaflet. An eccentric,
posteriorly-directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its
severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect).
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Post-bypass: The patient is receiving no inotropic support
post-CPB. There is a well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the
mitral position with good leaflet excursion. There is no
transvalvular or paravalvular regurgitation. The mean
transvalvular pressure gradient is 3 mm Hg at a cardiac output
of 6 L/min. The left ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal (LVEF 50%). Tricuspid regurgitation is moderate (2+). The
TV diameter at end diastole was 3.5cm All other findings are
consistent with pre-bypass findings. The aorta is intact
post-decannulation. All findings were discussed with the surgeon
intraoperatively.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing preoperative
work-up as an outpatient. On [**4-18**] she was brought directly to the
operating room where she underwent a mitral valve replacement.
Please see operative report for surgical details. She tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU intubated,
sedated, requiring pressors to optimize her cardiac function.
She was in critical but stable condition. Within 24 hours she
was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and
extubated without difficulty. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing
wires were removed per protocol. Beta-Blocker and diuresis was
initiated. She continued to progress and she was transferred to
the step down unit on post-op day #1. Beta blockers were kept at
a lower dose due to a SBP 90's. Physical therapy was consulted
for evaluation of strength and mobility.  The remainder of her
hospital course was essentially uneventful. She was cleared by
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] for discharge to home on POD#4. All follow up
appointments were advised.
