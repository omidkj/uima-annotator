Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]

Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 55 yo man w/ h/o end-stage sarcoid dx on home O2 (3L NC)
no longer on  xplant list, on home O2, who p/w SOB, f/c x 5
days. Pt was in his USOH until 5 days ago when noted increased
SOB, dry cough. Called PCPs office on [**3-8**], who directed him to
go to ED, but pt waited as is having financial problems at home
and wanted to wait to work out some things before coming to ED.
Pt had self-titrated up O2 to 4L. Also states felt like he had a
fever o/n, but did not take temp. Today pt was seen at home by
OT who noted that he had decreased O2 sats to 85-90% on 4L O2.
OT called PCPs office who instructed them to call ambulance.
Pt initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] where
initial vitals noted to be T 98.8, HR 81, BP 132/68, RR 18, O2
91% 4L NC. Labs notable for slightly elevated WBC at 10.4. CXR
there demonstrated ?new infiltrate, although difficult to assess
given underlying lung dx. Pt was given rocephin 1gm x 1, azithro
500mg x 1, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
In ED initial vitals T 97.4, HR 104, BP 115/82, RR 20, O2 91% 4L
NC. Pt admitted for further management.
Currently pt c/o continued SOB, cough, no other complaints at
this time.


Past Medical History:
1. Hepatitis C, diagnosed as part of the lung transplant workup

at the [**Hospital1 756**]. He is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in GI. He
is hepatitis B core surface antibody positive and surface
antigen
negative. In addition, he has hepatitis C antibody plus type 2b

with a viral load in [**8-/2185**], of 5.5 million. He had grade 2
fibrosis on [**2184-4-28**]. He is not thought to be a candidate
currently for interferon treatment given his sarcoidosis. He has

transaminitis.
2. Sarcoidosis. He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**]. The patient has
been obtaining PFTs from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and he is currently on
azathioprine and prednisone with prophylaxis Bactrim.
3. Sleep apnea.
4. Erectile dysfunction.
5. Emotional lability and anxiety.
6. Status post mandible fracture [**8-20**].
7. Status post multiple rib and clavicle fractures over the past

year secondary to fall.
8. Spinal stenosis: diagnosed on MRI and is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 363**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] orthopedic physician at the [**Hospital1 18**]. The diagnosis was
established as part of a workup for progressive lower leg
weakness, which led to multiple falls and currently an inability
to ambulate.
9. Shingles in [**12/2184**] on the right side of the face with
residual neuropathic pain.


Social History:
Lives in an apartment in [**Location (un) 1459**] with his 27 yo daughter who
is s/p traumatic brain injury in a motor vehicle accident. Has
another daughter from whom he is estranged. Recently divorced
from his wife of 33 years who he says did "not want to take care
of him." Patient is a former food salesman, selling restaurant
supplies to pizzerias. Has been unemployed for about a year, no
longer on unemployment. Recently obtained some disability
benefits. Reports a 10 pack year smoking history, but quit 20
years ago. Reports no history of ethanol use or IV drug use. Pt
had previous admission in which he was on high doses of
methadone and benzodiazepenes that were verified by PCP to be
prescribed by an outpatient physician to treat his pain from
spinal stenosis; pt believed to withdraw from both on previous
admissions.

Family History:
Non contributory of pulmonary disease.

bases, no increased work of breathing

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2186-3-11**]:Extensive pulmonary fibrosis and architectural
distortion, presumably due to the provided history of sarcoid
although basilar predominance is atypical. No findings to
suggest an acute superimposed pneumonia, but subtle infection
could be easily obscured by the chronic lung disease.
.
CXR [**2186-4-6**]:
Today's study demonstrates fracture displacement of the right
seventh rib laterally, other lower fractures were demonstrated
along the lateral chest wall on the 9:27 a.m. film. Severe
pulmonary fibrosis and marked emphysema are longstanding. There
is no evidence of acute pulmonary changes though subtle findings
would be missed. No appreciable pleural effusion is seen. Heart
size is normal. No pneumothorax.
.
CT Chest [**2186-3-14**]
1. No evidence of pneumonia or other acute cardiopulmonary
process.
2. Chronic severe pulmonary fibrosis, could be end- stage
sarcoidosis.
Chronic pulmonary hypertension.
3. Previous right upper lobe infection resolved.
4. Possible small right upper lobe mycetoma.
5. New left lower lobe 3.5 mm lung nodule warrants [**5-25**] month CT
followup.
.
CT abd:
1. Bilateral rectus sheath hematomas as described above. Small
amount of blood in the fat-containing right inguinal hernia.
2. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
3. Changes in the lung bases, incompletely evaluated, are
consistent with the patient's history of sarcoid.
4. Healing bilateral rib fractures.
5. Abdominal aortic ectasia as above up to 2.8 cm.
6. Nonobstructing left nephrolithiasis.
.
CT Chest [**2186-4-6**]:
1. Small PE of segmental/subsegmental right upper lobe branch.
This was communicated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 24949**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3766**] by telephone in the AM on [**2186-4-10**].
2. New minimally displaced fracture of the lateral right ninth
rib. Multiple additional bilateral healing rib fractures.
3. Healing left distal clavicle fracture.
3. Resolution of right upper lobe pneumonia.
4. Chronic severe pulmonary fibrosis in the setting of
sarcoidosis.
.
LE U/S:No evidence of DVT in either extremity.
