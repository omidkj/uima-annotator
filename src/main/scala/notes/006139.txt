Previous biopsies:    [**Numeric Identifier 43192**]  FS R 4 LYMPH NODE.
DIAGNOSIS:
FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT
FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
The following tests (antibodies) were performed: HLA-DR, FMC-7,
Kappa, Lambda, CD antigens 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 19, 20, 23, 45.
RESULTS:
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield.
B cells comprise 50% of lymphoid gated events, are polyclonal,
and do not express aberrant antigens.
T cells comprise 39% of lymphoid gated events and express mature
lineage antigens.

INTERPRETATION
Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic
immunophenotypic features of involvement by a T- or B-cell
lymphoproliferative disorder are not seen in specimen.
Correlation with clinical findings and morphology (see
S09-[**Numeric Identifier **]) is recommended. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may
not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or
artifacts of sample preparation.

CHEST (PA & LAT)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 43193**]
Reason: evaluate for effusion



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   48 year old man with s/p cabg mv repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   evaluate for effusion



Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after CABG and
mitral valve
repair.

PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to [**4-15**], [**2174**].

Post-sternotomy wires appear to be intact. Cardiomediastinal
contour is
stable. Left linear opacities consistent with atelectasis, with
overall
slight improvement of the left base aeration. Upper lungs are
clear and there
is no evidence of failure.

IMPRESSION:

Improved aeration of the left paramediastinal opacities
consistent with
improvement of atelectasis.
