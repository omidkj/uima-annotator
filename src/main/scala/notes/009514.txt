History of Present Illness:
86M with a history of prostate ca, afib on coumadin, remote
stroke, asbestos related lung disease on home O2, s/p
sub-capsular orchiectomy for prostate ca recurrence on [**2183-1-20**]
who was found by his wife lying in bed incontinent of urine with
a complaint of abdominal pain. Pt had a post-op urology visit on
[**1-29**] and was in his usual state of health at that time. He
subsequently had two falls without loss of consciousness or head
trauma on [**1-31**] and [**2-3**]. He attributes these falls to his severe
back pain and chronic unsteadiness on his feet secondary to a
movement disorder. On [**2-4**] he didn't want to get out of bed and
had decreased appetite. He developed a cough on [**2-5**] productive
of clear to white sputum, had ne episode of non-bloody
nonbilious emesis, and became confused on the night of [**2-5**].
This morning ([**2-6**]) he compained of L sided abdominal pain and
was found to have urinated in his bed, which he attributes to
not having enough time to walk to the bathroom. His daughter
describes his confusion as disorientation and hallucinating that
his wife was walking by. His temperature at home this morning
was 98.3.
.
He was brought to OSH for the new abdominal pain and ongoing
confusion, where he had a temperature of 100.3, and labs notable
for WBC 18.4 with 83% PMN and 3% bands, a lactate of 2.0, and
BNP 6421. The OSH ED reported a 30 second tonic-clonic seizure,
althogh the pt has a longstanding history of shaking all his
extremities and head rhythmically in response to anxiety or
pain. CXR was read as possible RML infiltrate and pt received
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and azithromycin at OSH ED. Pt had a
negative head CT and an abdominal CT showing L periaortic
retroperitoneal fat stranding with a small amount of
extraluminal fluid. He was found to have a troponin of 0.05 and
was med flighted here due to concern for NSTEMI. Per report, he
received 2 mg of ativan during the flight for "continuous [**Doctor Last Name 11332**]
mal" seizure that subsequently resolved.
In our ED, initial VS: 126/40 111 24 99%4L. EKG: afib oneteens,
no clear ischemia. 18g and 20g placed for access. Labs were
significant for WBC 15.3, 92.4% PMN, Trop 0.03, lactate of 2.7,
and INR 2.1. On arrival to the MICU, pt had T 98.2 HR 125, BP
128/82, RR 28, and sat 100% on 2L.
.

Past Medical History:
- Prostate Cancer. Received XRT 10 years ago. Recent recurrence
requiring subcapsular orchiectomy on [**1-20**].
- Afib. Diagnosed 10 years ago and transitioned to Coumadin.
- Rhythmic shaking/periodic limb movements of sleep. As
described
in HPI.
- Pacemaker. Placed for recurrent symptomatic PACs and PVCs.
Patient believes it was placed 10 years ago.
- Stroke in [**2148**] causing right facial weakness which mostly
resolved with rehab, though he still notices a right-sided
droop.
He believes the stroke was preceded one week before by a similar
episode of right sided facial weakness that was transient and
reversed.
- Chronic Lung Disease. Requiring oxygen at night and
occasionally during the day. Thought to be related to
significant
asbestos exposure (he worked as a pipe fitter).
