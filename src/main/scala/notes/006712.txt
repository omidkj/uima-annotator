[**2175-3-23**] BCx: NGTD
[**2175-3-23**] UCx: negative

IMAGING:
[**2175-3-23**] CXR: No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
.
[**2175-3-27**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
assumes a
different body position. Overall, however, there is no relevant
change. The lung volumes have slightly increased. There is no
evidence of recent focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
pneumonia. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.

Brief Hospital Course:
85-year-old woman with history of asthma, COPD, atrial
fibrillation on warfarin, HTN, sick sinus syndrome on pacemaker,
recent possible septic knee joint in [**2175-2-3**] presented with
a few days of shortness of breath with increased oxygen
requirement, productive cough, generalized fatigue, poor PO
intake at nursing home.

# SOB: Likely due to pnuemonia leading to COPD flare. The
patient reports SOB x4 days prior to admission. She also
reported generalized fatigue, poor PO intake. Patient denied
chest pain. She had a CXR at her nursing home that was
reportedly negative the day prior to admission, but patient was
nevertheless started on levofloxacin. She was sent to the ED
because of worsening O2 requirement (O2 sats low 90's on 4-5L
NC). In the ED she was placed on biPAP, initial VS: T 96.4, HR
90, BP 144/86, RR 22, 100% aon BiPAP. Her CXR was did not show
consolidation. Initial WBC was 14,000 (8,000 1 week prior).
Cardiac enzymes negative. ABG was 7.41/61/119. BNP was 8461,
elevated from her baseline. She received ipratropium-albuterol
nebs, furosemide 40 mg x 1 with reportedly minimal urine output.
She was also started on vancomycin and cefepime. BiPAP was
eventually weaned off to 4L NC, sating 94% and was admitted to
MICU for further management.  She was diuresed further with
another 40mg IV lasix and was negative 1L. She was also started
on 40mg prednisone and continued on nebulizers.  She required
BiPAP overnight for desaturations to the low 90's on NC and was
weaned off BiPAP by the next morning. Her legionella antigen
returned negative and antibiotics narrowed to levofloxacin only.
On the floor, she was continued on nebulizers, prednisone with
taper and levofloxacin for total 7 day course with improvement
in her respiratory status. At discharge, her O2 saturation was
93% RA.
.
# Chest pain - Pt with 1 episode of chest pressure on the floor.
No associated symtpoms. EKG unchanged. Pressure reproducible
with palpation. [**Month (only) 116**] be MSK due to deconditioning. ACS unlikely
given resolution of symptoms without intervention and no EKG
changes. This may anginal equivalent but pt has no known CAD. Pt
states it does not feel like GERD. Cardiac enzymes negative. Pt
did not have recurrence of chest pressure during her
hospitalization.
.
# Lightheadedness/fatigue - Pt had a few episodes of
lightheadedness with sudden feeling of fatigue. Per daughter, pt
has these episodes when pacer malfunctioning. During first
episodes: VSS, exam unchanged, EKG unchanged, CE neg x1, CXR
negative. EP interrogated pacer an
