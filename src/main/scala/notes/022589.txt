Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Augmentin / Penicillins / Moxifloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy, hypotension, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
86 yo M PMH DM, CAD presenting with 2d of lethargy general
weakness, cough with yellow sputum, SOB and subjective fevers.
EMS was called twice in the last two days for the same
complaints, yesterday BP found to be in 70s, however the first
time he refused transport. Today he has persistent symptoms
particularly of lethargy and he was finally convinced to come to
the ED. His family also noted two episodes of urinary
incontinence.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T96.9 [**Last Name (un) **] 60 BP: 98/50 RR18 O2Sat:
94% 2L NC. On admission he was initially hypoglycemic and
received D50. CXR with possible LLL infiltrate and mild to
moderate central congestion. BNP 937. Nl WBC ct. He received CTX
and Azithromycin for empiric CAP tx. He also received kayaxalate
30mg PO ONCE for hyperkalemia, ASA 325mg PO ONCE, 1.5L of NS.
After the IVF, his sats worsened quickly from normal to high 80s
on 4L. He was subsequently intubated for his worsening hypoxia
and also to improve his ability to get a CT head. Cardiology was
notified who recommended consideration of a heparin gtt.
Neurosurgery recommended repeating the CT head to fully evaluate
for SAH, which upon repeat was negative. His pressures were
reportedly in the 180s/100s upon transfer and therefore was
given 1gm of nitro paste prior to arrival.

STUDIES:
[**12-20**] CXR: A left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates within the right
atrium. The left cardiac border and the hemidiaphragms are
obscured by moderate-sized pleural effusions with adjacent
compressive atelectasis. Air bronchograms at the left
retrocardiac region may represent an underlying consolidation.
Hazy central opacities, with Kerley B lines demonstrated in the
periphery, are compatible with central [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion with
mild-to-moderate interstitial edema, worse on the right.

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
compressive
atelectasis. A dense left lower lobe opacity is concerning for
pneumonia.
Repeat radiography after diuresis may be of benefit to discern a
discrete
infiltrate.
2. Mild-to-moderate central [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion with
interstitial edema,
worse on the right.

[**12-21**]: Echo IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Pulmlonary
artery systolic hypertension. Normal left ventricular cavity
sizes with preserved global systolic function.Mild right
ventricular cavity enlargement with low normal free wall motion.
Minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-6-5**],
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now seen with
mild right ventricular cavity dilation and free wall
hypokinesis. Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is
no longer appreciated (may be due to technical factors)

[**12-20**] CT Head: Limited study due to motion despite multiple
acquisitions. No definite gross intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect. The ventricles are midline and normal in size. Small
hemorrhage, particularly subarachnoid, cannot be entirely
excluded due to motion.

[**12-20**] CXR: Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with
adjacent compressive atelectasis. Area of consolidation within
the left lower lobe is concerning for pneumonia.
Mild-to-moderate central [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion with interstitial
edema.

[**12-29**] AP PELVIS AND TWO VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FEMUR.
The patient is status post right THR, with non-cemented femoral
stem. No
periprosthetic lucency to suggest loosening and no focal
osteolysis is
detected. The femoral component is symmetrically seated within
the acetabular component. There is considerable surrounding
heterotopic ossification. Some notching at the junction between
the acetabulum and inferior pubic ramus is noted similar to the
appearance on the [**2142-3-7**] CT and may be postoperative. Probable
diffuse osteopenia. Scattered [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] calcification present. A
left common iliac stent and multiple clips about the pelvis
noted.
