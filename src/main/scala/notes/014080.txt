History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with unknown PMH p/w witnessed cardiac arrest
in the field. He was in [**Hospital1 778**], by report CPR was started by
retired nurses within seconds. EMS arrived in 3 minutes and ALS
was initiated. Initial rhythm VF, pt shocked x9, given 300 amio,
then another 150. atropine 1 mg, epi 3 mg, had regular rhythm at
15 minutes by EMS strips, return of spontaneous circulation at
20 minutes by report. Arrived at ED at [**Hospital1 18**] at 25 minutes with

Cardaic catheterization: Selective coronary angiography revealed
a right dominant system with patent LMCA and proximal LAD. Mid
LAD had a long 80% lesion. D1 had a 70% stenosis. LCX was
proximally totally occluded. RCA was free of angiographically
apparent disease. Left ventriculography was deferred.
Hemodynamic assessment showed normal left and right sided
filling pressures and low normal cardiac index. Successful
stenting  of the LCX with 3.5x28mm Cypher and a 3.0x8mm Cypher
(post dilated to 3.5mm). Occluded right iliac vessel.

ECHO ([**2174-6-13**]):Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w CAD. Possible regional right ventricular free
wall hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation. EF 55%

CXR([**2174-6-13**]): New mild to moderate heart failure.  Resolv
opacity in the right upper lobe.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old male w/ unknown PMH s/p vfib arrest. Cath revealed
LCx complete occlusion, which was stented.

#Cardiac: Had acute MI, with cypher stent placed in the left
circumflex artery. He was continued on aspirin, plavix,
atorvastatin, and metoprolol. Echo showed EF of 55%. s/p VF
arrest, had atrial fibrillation in the ED. Got amio loaded in
field. Was in sinus later and amio discontinued.  Pt remained
hemodynamically stable following revascularization, without
chest pain or further arrhythmias.  He will need to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] within the month.
.
#Neuro: Suffered anoxic brain injury as it took 20 minutes
before heart revived after the vfib arrest.  Upon arrival at
[**Hospital1 18**], pt underwent head & neck CT, which were unremarkable.
Neuro was consulted.  Pt started on cooling protocol.  Following
cooling protocol, pt was weaned off sedatives, and slowly began
showing signs of increasing neurologic function.  Following
cessation of paralytics, pt was able to move all extremities
without deficits; he was seen by PT and OT who both felt that he
would benefit from a rehab stay.  He required soft, ground diet
initially, though was transitioned to full PO after further
evaluation by speech & swallow.  The degree of anoxic brain
injury sustained is unclear, though MRI was unrevealing for
significant anoxic damage (see report).  The pt is pleasant & is
oriented to self.  However, he is not oriented to place or time,
indicating some cognitive deficits.

## Respiratory failure: Patient intubated in setting of code,
but extubated within 48 hours, without further respiratory
problems.

## Pneumonia: Had leukocytosis on admission thought to be
secondary to stress response; however, his leukocytosis
persisted and his CXR revealed a RUL infiltrate, thought to be
aspiration.  He was initially started on levaquin and flagyl,
but later changed to vancomycin and zosyn given that he had been
on a ventilator (to cover nosocomial pathogens).  His
infiltrates resolved on chest x-ray and he completed a 7 day
course of antibiotics in house.  His oxygen saturation was
consistently > 97% on RA.

## EtOH: Pt reportedly drinks 6-12 beers/day.  He required about
20 mg of valium on the 4th-5th days of hospitalization, however
subsequently has not required any more doses, without any signs
of withdrawal.

## FEN: He was seen by speech and swallow who cleared him for a
PO diet with ground solids and thin liquids (cardiac heart
healthy).  He should continue on this diet for now, but should
have a repeat speech and swallow evaluation at rehab at some
point, as he may be able to have his diet advanced in the near
future.

## Social: From SOCIAL WORK--Pt has reported HX of EtOH abuse.
SW met briefly
with pt and 2 sisters, then alone with sisters with pt's
permission while he had a PT eval.  Pt presented as anxious and
expressed wish to return home in near future.  [**Name (NI) 1094**] sisters,
[**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) **], talked about their ambivalence about taking
control while pt was confused, as pt has compartmentalized his
life in past, so they were not familiar with his friends, and
had
limited knowledge of his ex-wife and family.  Sisters expressed
concern pt has hx of heavy EtOH abuse since adolescence.  They
state pt's mother expressed concern about his drinking when she
was alive and pt lived with her.  Sisters have found large
quantities of beer in his house and car since his
hospitalization.  They note pt is a much loved high school
teacher and coach, and they have been surprised by the magnitude
of public support for him in his small town.  Sisters do not
believe pt has ever had a DUI or legal consequences for
drinking,
nor blackouts, missed work or any previous attempts at sobr
