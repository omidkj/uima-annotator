Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
"I fell."

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Open-reduction, internal-fixation of L hip.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 yo F w insulin-dep DM c/b neuropathy and right BKA
([**11-10**]), pA-Fib, GERD now s/p fall with impacted L subcapital
femoral neck fracture who is POD1 s/p ORIF.  Pt was recently
discharged [**2161-8-3**] from rehabilitation facility where she had
been since [**Month (only) **] following R BKA.  She was discharged to
daughter's home, and patient unfortunately experienced a fall
with fracture of her L hip on [**2161-8-4**].  She presented to the ED,
where she was seen by orthopedic surgery, who felt that she
needed operative intervention.  However, while in the ED, she
had oxygen desaturation and needed to be placed on BiPAP to keep
oxygen elevated.  For this reason, she was admitted to the MICU,
and remained there until s/p ORIF by orthopedic surgery on
[**2161-8-6**].

Pt reports that for the last 4-6 weeks she had a cough
productive of thin, non-bloody sputum, worse at night.  She
denies pleuritic or positional component, and at this time,
cough has resolved.  Pt still with question of SOB, not actively
endorsing SOB.  She denies any fevers, chills or weight loss.
No CP, diarrhea, constipation, bleeding.  Does have pain at this
time, but only wants Tylenol for pain control.

.
CT pelvis w/o contrast, [**2161-8-4**]:
IMPRESSION: Left minimally impacted subcapital femoral neck
fracture.
.
Hip XR, [**2161-8-4**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or subluxation of the left
hip.
.
ECHO, [**2161-8-5**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Small LV cavity size with mild symmetric LVH and
hyperdynamic LV systolic function. Abnormal LVOT systolic flow
contour without frank obstruction. Probable diastolic
dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Calcified mitral and aortic valve without significant stenosis
or regurgitation.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-2-8**],
overall ejection fraction appears hyperdynamic on the current
sutdy. Degree of mitral regurgitation is slightly less (may have
been OVERestimated on the prior study). Estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressures are higher. The other findings are
similar.
.
CXR, [**2161-8-9**]:
IMPRESSION: Limited study demonstrating subsegmental
atelectasis.
.
L knee XR, [**2161-8-10**]:
IMPRESSION: No fx.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 77 yo F w/ insulin-dep DM c/b neuropathy and
right BKA ([**11-10**]), pA-Fib, diastolic dysfunction, GERD who
presented s/p fall with impacted L subcapital femoral neck
fracture who had acute-onset SOB with h/o cough in the ED
requiring MICU admission.
.
# Acute diastolic congestive heart exacerbation: She was
initially placed on BiPAP with transition to NC with stable sats
in MICU. Despite elevated d-dimer, the patient and family
refused workup for pulmonary embolism.   With supplemental
oxygen, saturations improved and patient was weaned to nasal
cannula.   BNP elevated, but ECHO did not show any acute
worsening of cardiac function, and EKGs were without change.  Pt
was taken to OR for ORIF on HD2, and from there transitioned to
floor care.  However, she was clearly fluid-overloaded on
presentation to floor, responsive to diuresis with Lasix.  At
time of discharge, pt with bibasilar crackles (and bibasilar
atelectasis on CXR) but good saturations on RA.  In addition,
she was given nebs PRN for wheezing.
.
# Fracture: Per ortho, patient needed operative repair to regain
mobility, now POD4 s/p ORIF.  Pt declined opioid medications,
and pain controlled with scheduled Tylenol and PRN tramadol.  Pt
seen and evaluated by PT, and pt to have touch-down weight
bearing, per ortho.  F/U in 2 weeks at ortho clinic.
.
# Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus: FSG monitored, and
especially in post-op setting, tightly controlled.  Pt's
glargine increased to 23U from 20U qAM, and sliding scale
insulin used through rest of the day.
.
# UTI: pt with UA indicative of UTI, and leukocytosis on
admission.  Urine cx grew E.coli sensitive to ciprofloxacin, now
s/p 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
.
# History of atrial fibrillation: She had no episodes of atrial
fibrillation during hospitalization.  Beta-blockade was
continued.
