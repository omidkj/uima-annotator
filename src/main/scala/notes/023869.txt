Ext: Warm, well-perfused, -edema, mild bilat. varicosities
Neuro: A&O x 3, MAE, non-focal

Pertinent Results:
[**7-13**]: CNIS/Vein Mapping: 1. Patent greater saphenous veins
bilaterally with the measurements as above. 2. Less than 40%
stenosis of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
[**7-13**] Chest CT: 1. No calcifications identified within the
ascending aorta, up to the level of the aortic arch. 2. Right
lung nodules measuring up to 5 mm as described above. Followup
chest CT within one year is recommended.
[**7-14**] Echo: PREBYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with miold anterior and
inferior wall hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45=50 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen
at a SBP 100mm Hg. When the SBP was increased to 150 mm Hg with
phelylephrine and Trendelenburg position the MR increased to
moderate (2+).. There is no spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the left atrial appendage. POSTBYPASS: No aortic
dissection noted. Mitral regurgitation remains mild to moderate.
EF 45-50%. Remaining exam unchanged. All findings discussed with
surgeons at the time of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32142**] was admitted 1 day prior to surgery secondary to being
on Coumadin and to undergo more pre-operative testing. He was
brought to the operating room on [**7-14**] where he underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft x 4. Please see operative report
for surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to
the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. On post-op day one he appeared to be doing well
and was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
management. His pacer was interrogated by EP and his epicardial
pacing wires were d/c'd. His chest tubes were d/c'd on POD 2 and
the pt. progressed well.  He was restarted on his coumadin and
discharged to home on POD 4 in stable condition.  Dr.[**Name (NI) 79216**]
office was called on [**7-19**] for coumadin follow up.
