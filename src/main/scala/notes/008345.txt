Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respitory distress.  In ED the patient was found to be
hypoxic with sats of 72-86.  He was placed on a NRB without
improvement.  He was then put on CPAP and his resp symptoms
improved. He received 1 neb tx and 125 mg of Solumedrol.  An ABG
done in the ED revealed 7.4/43/84.  He was diuresed 600 cc of
urine, however his SBP dropped to the 70??????s and he was
subsequently given an IVF bolus. The pt was transferred to the
ICU and remained hemodynamically stable on a 40% Ventimask.
The etiology of his resp distress was thought to be
mulifactorial. His acute decompensation was thought to be due to
an infectious process considering his fever and leukocytosis --
pna vs bronchitis. No definite pneumonic consolidation was
identified on CXR, however it may have been masked by his marked
kyphoscoliosis. The pt was treated with IV Ceftriaxone and
Azithromycin and his symptoms and leukocytosis improved. He was
changed to po Levo to complete 10 days.  Bld Cx's remained neg
to date. His urine Cx grew Corynebacterium which was thought to
be a contaminate.  His sputum Cx was contaminated with
orophyarngeal secretions.   His O2 sats were kept >90% initially
on 5L NC on the floor.  He was unable to be weaned off O2 and he
was sent home with VNA services to help with home O2, PT, and
home safety. He required 1-2 L NC at rest and 4 L NC with
ambulation prior to d/c.  During his stay he received chest PT
and used incentive spirometry.
2. COPD -- thought to be secondary to large airway obstruction
secondary to kyphoscoliosis.  (No h/o smoking).  Pulmonary
function tests done in past revealed a mixed obstructive and
restrictive ventilatory defect  (FEV1 .86, FVC1 .78). This acute
episode is unlikely to be related to COPD exacerbation given
lack of wheezing and good air movement. Pt was given 125 mg of
IV solumedrol in ED.  Steroids may be contributed to his
leukocytosis.  Pt was continued on bronchodilators.
3. CHF. CHF exacerbation secondary to diastolic dysfuntion (EF
65%) may have  contributed to acute resp distress.  However, pt
appeared volume depleted based on initial hemoconcentration and
BUN/Cr >20:1.  Also there was no evidence of CHF on CXR.
4. HTN. Pt's antihypertensives were initially held secondary to
drop in BP after Lasix.  Atenolol, Moexipril, and Nifedipine
were restarted on [**7-6**].  Pt's SBP remained between 100-110. His
nifedipine was d/c'ed prior to d/c.
5. AAA. His BP was well controlled.
6. Bladder instability.  Treated with Oxybutynin.
7. Hypercholesterolemia.  Treated with Lipitor 10 mg.
