Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD


History of Present Illness:
52 y.o. male transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] where he presented
with hematemesis.  He has a history of upper GI bleeding and was
recently discharged from [**Hospital3 417**] 1 day prior to this
admssion for upper GI bleed.  He has a h/o Dieulafoy lesion in
the cardia and peptic ulcer disease.  He underwent EGD ([**2138-3-14**])
which revealed a small Dieulafoy in the cardia of the stomach,
which was injected with epinephrine, resulting in vigorous
bleeding.  He underwent multiple transfusions, and was
stabilized.  Repeat EGD [**3-17**] revealed no active bleeding.  He
was transferred the the medical floor at [**Hospital3 417**] [**3-18**],
but the following day had massive hematemesis again.  He was
transfused 5 units PRBCs, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
Initially admitted to the MICU, the patient was seen by GI in
consult.  He was hemodynamically stable with no further
hematemesis, and underwent repeat EGD here on [**2138-3-20**], revealing
clips and clots, but no active bleeding.  He is called out to
the floor [**2138-3-21**].

Brief Hospital Course:
52 y.o. male with h/o Dieulafoy lesion and PUD p/w hematemesis.

.
# Hematemasis - The patient has a h/o peptic ulcer disease, as
well as Dieulafoy's lesion.   He had EGD at the outside hospital
with hemostatis achieved. He then rebled requiring multiple more
blood transfusions and underwent EGD on [**3-20**] at [**Hospital1 18**] with no
evidence of active bleeding.  He was given protonix [**Hospital1 **]. His Hct
remained stable.  We considered the possibility of bleeding
varices given his ETOH history, but liver U/S w/o evidence of
portal hypertension, showing only fatty liver. No varices were
noted on multiple EGDs.  His diet was advanced to regular and
tolerated well.  He will f/u with his PCP.
.
# L Cephalic Vein clot: The pt had a PICC line placed at [**Hospital 6451**] hospital in his L arm, and was found to have a L
Cephalic vein clot by u/s, which was persued to investigate UE
swelling.  The PICC was removed, but no anticoaggulation given
due to recent GI bleeding.  This is a peripheral vein clot and
was treated with removal of the offending line.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - unclear etiology, likely due to alcohol
use/fatty liver disease, but more likely consumptive in setting
of recent bleeding.  HIT was considered low probability as Plts
remained stable.
.
# Elevated LFTs:  Hepatitis serologies indicate immunity to HBV,
but no active infection.  Abdominal u/s was performed and
revealed fatty liver, but no evidence of portal hypertension or
cirrhosis.  NASH or Alcoholic hepatitis are possible diagnoses.
 In addition, the patient reported he was recently started on a
statin, so this may be the cause.  His Zocor and Tricor were
held.  He was instructed to follow up with his PCP for repeat
LFTs, and referral to Hepatology if they remain elevated.
.
# CAD: The patient has known 3vd, but no evidence of active
ischemia>  His ASA was stopped to due GI bleeding, and should be
restarted by his PCP when appropriate.  After he was stabilized
for >48 hours, his b-blocker was re-started, which he tolerated
well.  He will be discharged on Toprol XL, and his PCP can
titrate the dose as needed.
.
# CHF: EF 30% by report.   His diuretics and b-blocker were held
in the ICU for possiblity of hemodynamic instabiltiy with recent
bleeding.  Upon transfer to the medical floor, the pt was volume
overloaded on exam.  His Lasix and B-blocker were restarted and
doses should be titrated by his primary care physician.
.
# COPD: Advair & nebulizers were continued.
.
# Renal failure: Etiology is unknown, presumed from hypertension
vs diabetes.  According to OSH records, he is near his baseline
(Cr 1.6) His Nephrocaps and Phoslo were restarted.
.
# Chronic back pain: Morphine initially, then Percocet prn.
.
FEN: Regular, monitor lytes
.
Proph: No heparin given GI bleed; Pneumoboots, [**Hospital1 **] PPI
