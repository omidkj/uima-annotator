History of Present Illness:
67 yo woman with CAD, obesity, hypertension, COPD, chronic pain
syndrome, chronic pancreatitis, here with abdominal pain x 5
days, radiating to back with associated nausea, without
vomiting.  This is similar to her episodes of prior
pancreatitis.  She tried to eat a bland diet, and took extra
oxycodone and tramadol, but she continued to have pain and
presented to the ED.  This pain is gnawing, in her epigastrium,
and radiating toward her back.  It is different from her pain
from reflux and her chronic chest pain.   She has had increased
soft stools, that are lighter in color.  No diarrhea.  No blood
in her stool.

She has had no fevers, no chills.  She has had a headache and
dizziness for the past week.  She has lost 5 lbs since last
discharged 10 days ago.  She had chronic shortness of breath,
and chronic chest pain.  Chronic difficulty initiating a urinary
stream.  No rashes.   Otherwise, reviewed in 13 systems and
negative.

In the ER, she had stable vital signs and pain with palpation of
her epigastrium.  She received morphine 8 mg, zofran, and 1 L IV
fluids.  Labs were essentially unremarkable.  EKG was unchanged.
 CXR was done prior to departure.

CXR [**11-6**]: CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: The lungs are clear, other
than mild lingular and retrocardiac atelectasis. A small left
pleural effusion persists. The heart is normal in size. The
aorta is mildly tortuous. There is no pneumothorax,

changes are noted in the thoracic spine. IMPRESSION: No acute
cardiopulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 67 year old woman with a history of hypertension,
diastolic heart failure, severe COPD on 3 L home oxygen,
pulmonary hypertension, CAD with stent to RCA in [**2110**] and
frequent readmissions for chronic "idiopathic pancreatitis" who
presented with typical abdominal pain flare. This improved with
bowel rest, narcotics, and anti-emetics. After several days of
hospitalization, she developed acute fever, delirium and [**Last Name (un) **].
All CNS medications were stopped including Antihistamines,
Ultram, and Morphine and her delirium resolved. Her fever also
resolved after 5 days of empiric Ciprofloxacin for abnormal UA
but negative urine cultures. The etiology of [**Last Name (un) **] was unknown
(normal BUN and creatinine increased from 1 to 4.6) but we held
diuretics and gave lots of IV fluids despite history of CHF.
Kidney function did not recover despite IV fluids, and she
developed wheezing, respiratory distress, and CXR showed
increased pulmonary edema. She received Lasix 80 IV, BiPAP, and
24 hour admission to the MICU. Her respiratory distress resolved
and did not require further Lasix treatment. However, the
etiology of [**Last Name (un) **] remains unclear. She had no hydronephrosis on
ultrasound and her post void residual was minimal on 2
occasions. She did not receive contrast or nephrotoxins. FENa
indicated intrinsic renal problem. Nephrology was hesitant
regarding renal biopsy because of obesity.  Her creatinine did
improve from 4 to 2.7 and upon discharge the patient reached a
plateau.

[**Last Name (un) **] - Creatinine improved but has plateu'd at 2.7.  Her
electrolytes are stable.  It is very unclear what her [**Name (NI) **] is
secondary to, and renal is concerned about an obstructive
process, despite a renal u/s being negative (including post void
residual via formal bladder ultrasound study) and bladder scan
being normal, as her Cr mainly improved when a foley was in
place the week prior.  We placed a foley put in again as a
trial, however, it was removed per the patients wishes. She was
set up with early follow up with both renal (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**] and
urology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within 1 week of discharge.

Pulmonary edema - resolved with diuresis and improving renal
function.  She was continued on a beta-blocker and nitrate.  The
dose of her nitrate was increased for optimal bl
