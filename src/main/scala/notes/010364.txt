Chief Complaint:
fever, tachypnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
75yo man presented from nursing home with dyspnea, tachypnea,
hypoxemia and fever to 103. According to rehab records, he was
found to be in respiratory distress at 8am the morning of
admission. He had O2sat of 76% RA, which increased to 81% on 2L
nasal canula. Otherwise, vitals at that time were 179/95, 140,
32, and temp of 103.3. FS was 190. He was given IM lasix 40mg.
Of note, he has had multiple prior episodes of pneumonia per
records and recently completed a 10d course of Levaquin
(completed on [**2163-2-4**]).
.
In ED, his vitals were as follows: (104.6, 163 -> 96, 142/90,
37, 100% on NRB). He was intubated (after succ/etomidate) and
sedated with fentanyl/versed. Blood cultures were sent. CXR and
CTA demonstrated bilateral basilar consolidations. Otherwise,
there was no PE or other acute pathology on the CTA. UA was
negative. He received empiric antibiotic coverage with
vanco/levaquin/flagyl. He received 6L of isotonic fluids. His
initial labs were notable for WBC count of 9.2 with 20% bands.
Anion gap of 14 and lactate of 3.6. Initial ABG was
7.36/29/293/17. Despite volume resuscitation, his sbp trended
down from 120's to 90's (nadir of 74/48) over his ED course.

.
CXR [**2-20**]: No central venous catheter is visualized on this
single image. Please correlate clinically. The tip of the
endotracheal tube is 6.8 cm above the carina. There is a
nasogastric tube. No pneumothoraces are identified. There is
again seen a left retrocardiac opacity which may be secondary to
underlying infiltrate versus consolidation. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions. There is again seen some thickening
along the right lateral chest wall in the region of previously
noted rib fractures. An old left sixth posterior rib fracture,
which has healed is again seen.
.
CXR [**2-20**]: Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube appear to be in
good position. Unchanged left lung base density, which may
represent consolidation and is better evaluated on the CT scan
from earlier today.
.
CTA: 1. No evidence of pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, or
aortic dissection. 2. Dominant left lower lobe pneumonia with
questionable right lower lobe pneumonia as well as multifocal
scattered tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities are suggestive of multifocal
infectious process, possibly aspiration related. 3. Mediastinal
lymphadenopathy, may be reactive, but in the setting of a RLL
nodule would suggest repeat evaluation with CT in 3 months after
treatment. 4. Small- to- moderate sized hiatal hernia. 5. Tip of
nasogastric tube within distal esophagus, re-advancement
recommended.
.
CXR [**2-20**]: The tip of the endotracheal tube is 5.4 cm above the
carina. There is a nasogastric tube whose distal tip is not
included on the field of view. The hazy opacity at the left base
is unchanged. An old left posterior fifth healed rib fracture is
again seen. There is a small pleural-based density seen along
the right lateral chest wall. The previously seen pneumothorax
is not well appreciated.
.
CXR [**2-20**]: 1. Curvilinear line in the right lateral chest wall,
suspicious for a pneumothorax. 2. There is a hazy opacity seen
at the left base concerning for developing infiltrate. 3. Small
bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CXR [**2-21**]: Overall similar to one day earlier, with possible
slight increase in the degree of alveolar opacification in the
left mid zone. Basedon the appearance of the right lung, I doubt
the presence of CHF.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 75 year old man with history of COPD,
DM, CAD, presents with respiratory failure secondary to
aspiration pneumononia c/b septic shock.
.
1.) Respiratory Failure - The patient presented with respiratory
failure secondary to probable aspiration pneumonia. A speech and
swallow eval showed no overt signs of aspiration however his
clinical picture was consistent.  He was intitially intubated
for hypoxic respiratory failure and later successfully weaned.
His breathing improved with antibiotics and bronchodilators.  By
time of discharge his oxygenation  was normal. Sputum culture
showed rare growth of E. coli which was sensitive to quinolones.
 He  will complete a 14 day total course of antibiotics.
.
2.) Septic Shock - THe patient initially met criteria by marked
fever, bandemia, tachypnea, tachycardia as well as suspected
infection, hypotension, and elevated lactate. He was transiently
on vasopressor therapy.  His blood pressure stabilized.  Given
his recent illness, his home dose of metoprolol was
discontinued.  Anti-hypertensive therapy can be resumed as
needed as outpatient, with the possibility of including an ACEi
or [**Last Name (un) **] with regard to his diabetes
