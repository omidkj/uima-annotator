Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7455**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension with positive blood cultures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ultrasound guided left hip fluid drainage
left PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
88 yo f with PMH of atrial fibrillation and HTN presented to the
ED on [**2144-2-9**] with failure to thrive. According to patient's
daughter, patient with increased fatigue and sleepiness x 2 days
with associated worsening mobility x 1 day. Patient's daughter
then called the geriatrics on-call attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1603**] who
recommended that she come into the ED. Upon admission to the ED,
patient had a fever to 100.1 and was given tylenol. She was
given 1L NS as patient looked very dry. She was admitted to the
medicine service.
.
Initially, she was noted to have low grade temps, left hip pain
and leukocytosis. Given previous hip replacements, ortho was
consulted. Initial XR showed no fracture. Ortho recommended
ultrasound of hip and US guided arthrocentesis. LENIs showed no
DVT but flattening of the waveform suggsting more proximal
obstruction. US hip showed mostly solid 4 cm hematoma extending
anteriorly from the femoral prosthesis to the proximal femoral
diaphysis with no definite signs of abscess.
.
Over the next two days, she triggered on [**2-10**] for rigoring, temp
to 102, and hypertension. Her abx were broadened to include
vancomycin and zosyn. She triggered again on [**2-11**] for BP 79/48
and HR 120, and was bolused with fluids with improved BP to
90's. Initial blood cultures were negative, but repeat cultures
on [**2-10**] were noted to be growing 4/4 bottles with GPC's in pairs
and chains. She received a total of about 1.5 liters of fluid on
the floor. Given possibility of sepsis, she was transferred to
the ICU for closer monitoring and treatment despite DNR/DNI.
.
Initial BP in the MICU was 101/57and HR 100's. She has mild left
hip pain, denies chest pain, shortness of breath, other pain.
She feels generally "unwell" but is mildly disoriented as is ber
baseline by report. She is unwilling to provide further ROS.

IMAGING:
- Hip Unilateral XR - [**2144-2-9**] - Bilateral hip prostheses with
multiple chronic abnormalities as described above. No acute
fracture or change in alignment.
- Left unilateral US - [**2144-2-9**] - No DVT in the imaged veins.
However, flattening of the left venous waveforms suggests a more
proximal obstruction and further evaluation of the proximal
vessels with CT or MR is recommended.
- [**2144-2-9**] - Portable CXR - IMPRESSION: Decrease in the size of
the chronic right-sided pleural effusion since the prior study
of [**Month (only) 547**]
- MRI read pending
- Hip ultrasound: mostly solid 4 cm hematoma extending
anteriorly from the femoral prosthesis to the proximal femoral
diaphysis with no definite signs of abscess
.
[**2-10**] MRI Pelvis: Bilateral masses with a large intrapelvic
component, larger on the right, which appear related to the
joints. Evaluation is suboptimal. These masses were present on
the prior CT examination, but appear somewhat smaller in size.
Hematoma is not considered likely due to the chronicity.
However, given the history of multiple hip replacements, the
bilaterallity, and the unusual appearance of these lesions,
foremost consideration is given to a foreign-body reaction. Less
likely would be a proliferative synovial condition such as PVNS,
or synovial chondromatosis.
.
[**2-11**] US EXTREMITY NONVASCULAR LEFT LE: Findings most consistent
with a hematoma extending anteriorly from the femoral prosthesis
to the proximal femoral diaphysis.  There are no son[**Name (NI) 493**]
findings of an abscess, however, an element of superimposed
infection cannot be excluded.
.
[**2-12**]: US MULT/COMP ABSC/CYST DRAIN/I; GUIDANCE FOR ABSCESS:
Successful ultrasound-guided aspiration of left thigh hematoma.
5-6 cc of dark red fluid was sent for Gram stain and culture.


Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo f with past medical history significant for atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, hypertension, and s/p bilateral hip
replacements who presented with lethargy and found to have left
hip hematoma now transfered to the MICU for possible sepsis from
GPCs.
.
#) Sepsis:  She presented with hypotension in the setting of
fevers and elevated WBC count and Group-B streptococcal
bacteremia c/w septic physiology.  She was admitted to the MICU
and was originally started on Vancomycin/Pip-Tazo on [**2-11**]
however antibiotics were changed to Penicillin G when hip fluid
and blood cultures grew out Group B strep sensitive to
penicillin.  She defervesced and BPs stabilized and she was
transferred out of the unit to the general medicine service.
TTE was negative for vegetations.  Orthopedics was consulted who
offered possible surgical intervention for removal of her
hardware from previous total hip replacement, however patient
and her family and HCP opted against surgical intervention.
Thus, she will need continued IV antibiotics (3 million units IV
Pen G q6h) for 6-8 weeks and then will likely need oral
antibiotics following IV course.  She is scheduled for follow in
the infectious disease clinic.
.
#) Left hip hematoma with secondary infection with Group B strep
and source of GBS bacteremia.  Her pain was managed with
lidoderm patch, standing tylenol and prn morphine IV.  She was
noted to have had on admission a significant hematocrit drop
from her baseline, but her hct remained stable not requiring
prbc transfusion.  She did, however, receive 3U FFP on admission
to the ICU as her INR was supratherapeutic at that t
