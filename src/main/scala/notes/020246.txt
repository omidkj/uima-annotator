Admission Date: [**2123-1-6**]        Discharge Date: [**2123-2-4**]

Date of Birth:  [**2059-10-21**]        Sex:  F

Service:  NSU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient has a long history
of lower back and leg pain and presented to consultation to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] for examination with complaints of worsening
sensory loss on the right side of her body including her
face.  She underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the head
which showed a 5mm aneurysm in the supraclinoid left
internal carotid artery.  She was brought to the
neuroendovascular suite and underwent a diagnostic cerebral
angiogram which showed a four by four by five millimeter
aneurysm with a 3.5 millimeter neck of the supraclinoid left
internal carotid artery segment.  She was advised to return
on [**2123-1-6**], to undergo a coiling of that aneurysm.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Anxiety/depression.  She has been
hospitalized for that in the past, most recently in [**2122-5-16**].

Status post bilateral hip and knee replacements.

Osteoarthritis.

Chronic low back pain and sciatica.

History of T5 fracture, T4 through 5 disc with cord
compression, cervical stenosis and prior lumbar surgeries.

History of chest pain, and she has had atypical symptoms.
Stress MIBI showed global hypokinesis with an ejection
fraction of 43 percent, no ischemia.  There is a question of
mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smokes one pack per day times
fifty years.  She does not drink alcohol for the last ten
years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 138/68, heart rate 75,
oxygen saturation 95 to 96 percent in room air.  In general,
she is in no acute distress.  Heart shows regular rate and
rhythm, II/VI systolic murmur.  Lungs distant breath sounds
without any wheeze.  Extremities - one plus ankle swelling.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the endovascular
neurovascular angiography suite and underwent a stent mediated
coiling of her left internal carotid artery aneurysm.
Postoperatively in the interventional suite while waking up, she
was noted to have a systolic blood pressure of 220 to 230
range accompanied by difficulty breathing following extubation as
a result of her pulmonary disease and smoking history. She had
been extubated but needed to be reintubated because she was
unable to maintain an adequate breathing rate.  Although her
neurological examination was stable at this point, a stat head CT
was performed since she was reintubated and there was no longer a
neurological examination to follow.   The head CT showed evidence
of intraparenchymal blood with a subarachnoid component in a
sulcal compartment. She was brought to the Post Anesthesia Care
Unit and was noted to be awake, alert, following commands in all
four extremities but slightly worse in her right hand at first
which improved back to baseline. Her heparin was reversed with
protamine and a post-protamine ACT checked which confirmed return
to baseline.  She was also making I can't breathe mouthing words
around her endotracheal tube.  At 9:00 p.m., she was noted to
have developed a right hemineglect and right hemiparesis.  The
patient was brought emergently to the CT scanner where there was
evidence of a large left- sided hemorrhage and expansion of the
previous clot. She was rushed emergently to the operating room
for a left decompressive craniotomy and left temporal lobectomy,
partial.  On the afternoon of [**2123-1-7**], a ventriculostomy drain
was placed to rule out hydrocephalus.  She had a low opening
pressure of less than ten and her ICPs remained in that range
throughout the day.  Her head CT that day showed no rebleeding
after the craniotomy and decompression.  Postoperatively, the
patient was brought to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where she
was kept intubated and sedated with strict blood pressure
parameters, intubated, sedated, paralyzed with blood pressure
parameters less than 140.  Her pupils were noted on her first
postoperative day to be 4.5 and reactive on the right and 4.0
and reactive on the left.  A follow-up head CT on [**2123-1-7**],
showed a left intraparenchymal hematoma evacuation and
craniotomy with slight decrease in mass effect.  She was
started on Heparin, on Aspirin.  She was kept sedated and
kept her blood pressure less than 140 to 150.  Her
ventriculostomy drain was kept at ten above the tragus.
Social services were involved with the patient and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**]
kept in contact with her separated husband who was her next
of [**Doctor First Name **].  On her second postoperative day, she remained
paralyzed and sedated.  Her ICPs were in the eight to twenty
range, eighteen mostly.  Her hematocrit was 27.2.  Her
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was discontinued.  She was given one unit
of packed red blood cells.  She was started on Mannitol 25 mg
three times a day due for concerns of worsening edema on her
latest head CT.  Her head of bed was elevated at 45 degrees.
She was also given Lasix in addition to Mannitol and Morphine
drip was started for pain control.  Her pCO2 goal was 30 to
35.  On [**2123-1-10**], her CT was noted not to be significantly
changed compared with the day before.  There was a large left
sided temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and moderate
amount of mass effect, surrounding edema.  There was no
significant shift of normal midline structures.  Her ICP
remained in the three to twelve range.  She was continued on
sedation.  Her hematocrit was 25.4.  The Intensive Care Unit
team had some resistance to giving blood for that hematocrit.
She had an echocardiogram to rule out congestive heart
failure which showed that her overall systolic ejection
fraction was normal at 55 percent.  There was mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.  There was no pericardial
effusion.  The mitral valve was noted to be mildly thickened
but no mitral regurgitation was seen.  On [**2123-1-12**], the
patient underwent a diagnostic cerebral angiogram which
showed moderate vasospasm in the left middle cerebral artery
with a patent stent without thromboemboli evidenced by
angiogram.  On neurologic examination, her pupils are
bilaterally equal and reactive. With the recent find of left
middle cerebral artery vasospasm, they recommended keeping
her pCO2 at 35 to 40, keeping her drain at 10.  Cerebrospinal
fluid culture was sent given her cloudy appearance.  Systolic
blood pressure between 120 to 160 and Aspirin daily and
hematocrit target of 30 percent.  Her sedation was weaned and
paralytic were shut off on the evening of [**2123-1-12**], into
[**2123-1-13**].  She was also started on Nimodipine given her
vasospasm 30 mg q4hours.  She was started on Levaquin for a
possible pneumonia.  She began to spike fevers on [**2123-1-14**],
and [**2123-1-15**], her Dilantin was discontinued with the
thoughts that it could possibly be causing her drug fever.
She was started on Keppra.  On [**2123-1-14**], on examination,
her eyes were open, her pupils were four and reactive.  She
was biting on her tube at the time.  She did not have any
movement of her extremities.  She had electroencephalogram
performed which showed encephalopathy.  She continued to
spike fevers 106 to 103 from [**2123-1-14**], to [**2123-1-17**].
Various cultures were sent off.  She was started on
Vancomycin to have broad coverage.  She was noted to have
gram positive cocci of her ventriculostomy drain from
[**2123-1-12**].  On [**2123-1-17**], she received infectious disease
consultation.  Her cerebrospinal fluid was resent at that
time.  They recommended continuing on intravenous Vancomycin
and to discontinue her ventriculostomy and place a lumbar
drain as needed.  She was treated with Levaquin for her
pneumonia.  Her cerebrospinal fluid that was sent on
[**2123-1-17**], had no growth.  Her examination on [**2123-1-19**],
was that she was opening her eyes.  She had minimal amount of
her right upper extremity and no movement of her lower
extremity.  On [**2123-1-22**], she underwent percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy and tracheostomy insertion without any
problems.  [**Name (NI) **] ventriculostomy drain was discontinued and the
