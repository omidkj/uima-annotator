History of Present Illness:
19 yo male with history of childhood asthma never requiring
intubation, hospitalized x1, and mutiple steroid tapers
transferred here from an OSH for status asthmaticus. The patient
presented to [**Hospital 11074**] clinic on [**10-18**] with complaints of cough
productive of yellow sputum x2 days and increasing SOB without
fevers, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He was given oral
prednisone, erythromycin, and ipratro + alb nebs x3 with poor
response.  He was then transeferred by ambulance to [**Location (un) 16843**]
emergency department. In ED he continued to be short of breath
and was given solumedrol 125 IV, albuterol nebs, racemic epi and
epi 0.3mg SC.  Arterial blood gas showed 7.31/53.4/82.8 and CXR
only showed hyperinflation.  He was intubated.  Pt was difficult
to ventilate and post-vent ABG was 7.08/98/430 so he required
paralysis.  Admission labs significant for WBC 17.3 and 5%
bandemia. He was cont on steroids, started on azithromycin and
given q2hr [**Location (un) **]'s but cont to have poor oxy and vent with ABG of
7.3/61/76 and decision was made for transfer here.

      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR
LEUKOCYTES.
      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2141-10-30**]):
      RARE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
      KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE.    RARE GROWTH.

[**2141-10-20**]: PORTABLE AP CHEST: No prior studies are available for
comparison. The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position in
the mid trachea. An NG tube is present with the tip not
visualized, off the inferior film edge. There is no
pneumothorax. There is bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral
pleural effusions. No focal consolidations are seen.

[**2141-10-24**]: PORTABLE AP CHEST: 1. Worsening pneumomediastinum.  2.
Right apical pneumothorax, which appears new in the interval.
3. Bandlike areas of lucency in lower paraspinal region which
appear to represent a combination of posterior pneumomediastinum
and adjacent pulmonary interstitial emphysema on recent chest
CT.
4. Perihilar and basilar opacities, with overall improving
aeration at the lung bases.

[**2141-10-30**]: PORTABLE AP CHEST: 1. Tiny right apical pneumothorax
following chest tube removal. 2. Bibasilar opacities with
interval worsening at the left lung base. The area of worsening
could be due to a progressive infection or due to superimposed
aspiration.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2141-10-22**] 11:31 AM
1. Multifocal bronchopneumonia with patchy consolidation and
bronchial wall thickening.
2. Collapse of both lower lobes with adjacent small effusions.
3. Pneumomediastinum and pulmonary interstitial emphysema.
4. Overinflation of ETT cuff.


Brief Hospital Course:
On admission to floor pt's vital were T 101.8 HR 116 BP 118/60
vented at 17/650/50% with 8 of peep with sats of 92% and initial
ABG of 7.21/83/11. He was cont continued on high dose
solumedrol, increased the azithromycin dose, given q1hr
combivent [**Month/Day/Year **]'s and sedated and paralyzed for better
ventilation.

1) Respiratory failure:  His presentation was consistent with
poorly controlled asthma exacerbated by smoking although it is
unclear what was the precipitating factor for status
asthmaticus.  With his elevated WBC, bandemia and spiking
fevers, CXR, sputum cx, blood cx, ucx were obtained for fever
workup.  Blood culture showed strep viridans, but this was likey
contaminated.  CT scan showed bullous lung disease, patchy
opacities, and collapse of lower lobes bilaterally.  Pt was
empirically treated with azithro (for community acquired
pneumonia), vanco, and ceftriazone.  Bronchoscopy showed small
amounts of thick mucus.  BAL performed grew out pan-sensitive
klebsiella and oxacillin-sensitive staph.

Pt was difficult to ventilate and required paralytics and
sedation with propofol, then with versed/fentanyl.  Sats ran in
the low 90's while intubated with
AC/RR18/PEEP5/TV550/FIO60-100%.  High dose steroids were
continued.  Albuterol [**Month/Day/Year **] 14-16puffs q1hr.   After about five
days in the ICU, paralytics were discontinued but pt was kept
well-sedated on fentanyl.  Oxygenation improved and FIO was
weaned down to 60's. Sedation was weaned off and on [**2141-10-29**], pt
was extubated and placed on high flow facemask.  Pt was
transitioned to oral prednisone for a slow taper and antibiotics
were discontinued. Inhaled steroids were added while steroids
were tapered off.

On [**11-1**], the patient's sats were in the high 90's on 3L nasal
canula.  Alpha1-antitrypsin and HIV serologies were sent to
workup etiology of the small bullous lesion seen on CT scan,
however both were negative and it is felt that the lesions were
due to barotrauma, as evident by pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous
emphysema, and bilateral pneumothoraces.

He was transferred to the floors on [**11-1**], and recovery was
uneventful.  He had no further respiratory difficulties, with O2
sat of 96% on RA on the day of discharge.  He was maintained off
abx and remained afebrile.  He was kept on prednisone 50 mg PO
qday, which should be tapered slowly 10 mg q week.  He is being
discharged on 40 mg PO qday as of [**2141-11-6**].  He has been
instructed to make an appointment with a primary care physician
as soon as possible, and to have them set him up with a
pulmonologist as well.  He will be discharged on
Fluticasone/Salmeterol inhaler, as well as albuterol.

2)  The patient had hyperglycemia due to steroid use while in
the ICU that was covered with RISS.  He should have his glucose
checked by finger stick when he sees his new primary care
physician.

3)  The patient had an elevated CK on admission to the ICU that
slowly trended down.  His muscles were extremely week after
extubation, and he was seen by PT for rehab while in house with
rapid recovery of strength.  It is thought that he was weak from
bedrest/prolonged paralytics.
