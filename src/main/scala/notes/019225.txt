Imaging:
CXR: CHEST, AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE: No prior studies are available
for comparison. The heart size is normal, allowing for AP
technique. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
unremarkable. The lungs are clear. There are no pleural
effusions or pneumothorax. There is no free air or
pneumomediastinum.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
.
RUQ US:
FINDINGS: This is a technically difficult examination due to the
patient's body habitus and overlying bowel gas. The pancreas and
aorta are not visualized in the midline. The liver is visualized
and no focal liver lesions, although this is a technically
difficult examination. The portal vein is patent with normal
centripetal flow. The gallbladder is normal with no evidence of
any cholelithiasis. The CBD is not dilated at 3 mm. The right
kidney measures 10.7 cm in maximum length with normal renal
cortical thickness. The left kidney measures 10.6 cm in maximum
length with normal renal cortical thickness. The spleen is
moderately enlarged at 14.7 cm.

IMPRESSION:
1. Technically difficult examination due to patient's body
habitus and overlying bowel gas with no focal liver lesions
identified.
2. Pancreas and aorta are not visualized in the midline.
3. Moderate splenomegaly at 14.7 cm.

EGD:
Impression:
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus (ligation)
Blood in the stomach body and fundus
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
53 F w/ autoimmune hepatitis/cirrhosis and known varices who
presents with hematemesis and bleeding varices, s/p variceal
banding and called out of the MICU for further management.  Her
hospital course is as follows:
.
Hematemesis/Anemia: Patient was transferred from OSH after
having episode of hematemesis.  Her Hct was slgihtly below her
baseline on arrival.  She was tranferred to the MICU for close
monitoring.  Given her h/o cirrhosis and varices, variceal bleed
was likely.  She was put on octreotide, mitodrine, and EGD was
performed.  EGD demonstrated varices at the lower third of the
esophagus.  She was banded x3.  She remained stable afterwards
on the floor, with her Hct remaining from 31-36.  She was given
carafate and PPI [**Hospital1 **] and tolerated this well.  She will need
follow up EGD in [**6-1**] days.
.
Cirrhosis: Thought to be autoimmune.   Started lactulose.
Hepatitis panel was negative.  AFP was 1.9.  Azathioprine was
re-started.  Was told to follow up with her regular
hepatologist.
.
DM2: Was not taking glipizide at present on admission.  Her
blood sugars were actually well controlled without therapy.
Question if her hyperglycemia was steroid related in the past.
She should have her sugars followed up as an outpatient.
.
Asthma: Stable. Continued albuterol
.
