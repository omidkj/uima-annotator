History of Present Illness:
63 y/o F with hx of severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib,
ulcerative colitis, and recent lower GI bleed who is transferred
from [**Hospital1 1774**] with acute dyspnea and hypoxia.  Per her daughter,
she has been more dypsneic on exertion for the past week with
episodes somewhat relieved with albuterol.  The pt reports that
she awoke at 3:15 AM with acute shortness of breath and
wheezing.  She denies chest pain, palpitations, fevers, chills,
night sweats.  She denies cough.  An albuterol inhaler did not
help, so she went to the [**Hospital1 1774**] ED.
.
In the [**Hospital1 1774**] ED, she placed on bipap with O2sat 100%.  Her BP
was initially 104/67, HR 55, RR13.  CXR showed R pleural
effusion.  BNP was 1500, cardiac enzymes negative.  HCT was
noted to be 24.9 (baseline 24-27).  At 6am her blood pressures
dropped to 83/44 and she was given a 125cc NS bolus.  ABG on
bipap was 7.34/60/313/32.  At 7:30am, Levophed gtt was started.
At 8am she was transitioned to a NRB and was satting 100%.  Her
levophed was increased at 8:15am.
.
On arrival to the ICU, she reports comfortable breathing ever
since being placed on O2.  ROS is otherwise positive for more
black stools over the past 2-3 days.
.
Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (3) 13475**] due to lower
GI bleed and HCT of 17.  She required 6 units PRBCs that
admission and bleeding was felt to be due to lower GI
angioectasia; colonoscopy was not done due to recent scope [**1-30**]
which showed many angioectasias throughout the colon.  HCT was
stable at 24.7 on discharge and most recent HCT [**3-26**] was 27.4.
She was also treated for congestive
heart failure exacerbation and acute renal failure on that
admission and was discharged on spironolactone, torsemide and
metolazone still about 40 lbs above her dry weight.  At her
follow-up appointments, her weight was still stable, so
spironolactone was increased on [**3-15**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**] (weight 199
lbs) and her torsemide on [**3-18**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] (weight 196 lbs).
The pt reports medication compliance (does sometimes take
medications late) and general diet compliance although "ate more
over [**Holiday **]."  She does recall an episode of left leg pain two
days ago while trying to go up stairs and feels she may have
been when she started feeling more short of breath, although the
acute episode of dyspnea was not until later.
.

[**2109-4-1**]: Portable CXR
INDICATION: 63-year-old female with history of CHF, shortness of
breath.
[**Month/Day/Year **] for pulmonary edema.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2109-2-26**] and multiple priors.

SINGLE PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: In comparison to
the most
recent chest radiograph as well as the recent CT, there has been
an increase
in a right pleural effusion. Lung volumes are low, accentuating
the heart
size, but even allowing for technique very stable moderate
cardiomegaly. The
bony thorax is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Increased right and continued left pleural effusion.


[**2109-4-1**]: Portable CXR
HISTORY: Central line placement.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there has been
placement of a right subclavian catheter that extends to the
mid-to-lower
portion of the SVC. Otherwise, little change.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


[**2109-4-2**]: TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. A septal occluder device is seen across the
interatrial septum. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. [Intrinsic
right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is
abnormal
