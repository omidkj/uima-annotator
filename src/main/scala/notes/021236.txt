History of Present Illness:
80 year old male with severe MVR w/pacemaker for sudden cardiac
arrest presents with 3 days of worsening DOE and new onset of
afib with RVR. He was seen by PCP and started on augmentin on
[**2176-10-22**] for possible PNA, with possible infiltrate vs.
pulmonary edema. Pt notes worsening dyspnea, with significant
extertional dyspnea. Pt has also had a dry cough that started
around Monday as well. He denies fever/chills/chest
pain/hemoptysis/orthopnea/PND/extremity edema/pleuritic
pain/calf pain. In the ED he was started on heparin gtt, given
lasix 20mg IV, and Levoquin 500mg PO for possible PNA on CXR. He
was admitted for further workup.

Pertinent Results:
[**10-25**] Head CT: 1. Small subacute subdural hematoma along the
right tentorium and left frontal lobe. 2. Gliosis in the right
frontal lobe likely secondary to prior trauma.
.
[**10-26**] Head CT: The subdural collection along the right tentorium
and right frontal lobe seen yesterday is not appreciated today.
Gliosis in the right frontal lobe is unchanged. Prominence of
the ventricles and sulci is again noted which is likely
secondary to age-related involutional changes. White matter
hypodensity suggests sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic
disease. There is no evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage,
large mass, mass effect, edema, or hydrocephalus. There is
preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation. The visualized
portions of the mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are well
aerated. No skull fracture is seen. Prior burr hole in the left
parietal skull area is again noted. There is also a similar
skull indentation along the left frontal convexity.
.
[**10-30**] Head CT: Thin subdural hematoma along the left frontal
pole, with both chronic and subacute components, unchanged.
.
[**11-12**] Head CT: The small left frontal subdural hematoma,
intermediate in density, is unchanged in size and demonstrates
no evidence of new blood products. There is no mass effect on
the underlying left frontal lobe, as the extraaxial spaces and
ventricles are enlarged due to cerebral atrophy. A small area of
encephalomalacia is again noted in the inferior right frontal
lobe, likely secondary to prior trauma, or less likely prior
infarction. There are multiple foci of low density in the deep
and periventricular white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, as
before, likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

.
[**10-28**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this left
dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow
limiting stenoses. The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA were patent. 2.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided
filling pressures with an RVEDP of 14 mmHg and severely elevated
left sided filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 29 mmHg and a
prominent V wave. There was moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension with a PASP of 48 mmHg. The cardiac index was
depressed at 1.3 L/min/m2.  There was low normal systemic
arterial systolic pressures with an SBP of 100 mmHg.
.
[**10-28**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA less than 40% stenosis.
Left ICA less than 40% stenosis.
.
[**2176-10-31**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced, on
norepinephrine, epinephrine, and milrinone infusions. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left atrial appendage is not seen status post ligation. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior,
inferoseptal, and inferolateral walls. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter. There is an intra-aortic balloon pump in place 3 cm
distal to the takeoff of the right subclavian artery. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A
bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
transmitral gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results at time of
surgery.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced. The patient is on
norepinephrine, epinephrine, and milrinone infusions. Inferior,
inferoseptal, and inferolateral wall hypokinesis appears
improved, but remains mildly hypokinetic. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. No change in tricuspid regurgitation or
aortic regurgitation. The aorta is intact post-decannulation.
.
[**2176-11-1**] Echo: The left atrium is dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve
prosthesis is present. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. Significant
