PREOPERATIVE LABORATORIES:  Showed a white count of 9.6,
hematocrit of 33, platelet count 242,000.  Sodium 138, K 3.9,
chloride 101, CO2 24, BUN 13, creatinine 1.1, and a blood
sugar of 97.

The patient was on Plavix, preoperatively.  Her last dose was
on [**3-29**].  She was Portugese speaking.

Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary disease.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on [**4-4**] and had a coronary artery bypass grafting times two by
Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] with LIMA to the LAD and a vein graft to the
PDA.  She was transferred to Cardiothoracic ICU stable on a
propofol drip and a nitroglycerin drip.

On postoperative day one, her Neo-Synephrine drip was weaned
off and she was extubated.  She was hemodynamically stable,
in sinus rhythm in the 60's, with a blood pressure of 120/65.
Her hematocrit, postoperatively, was 24 with a BUN of 19,
creatinine of 0.8, blood sugar of 142, K of 5.0, PT of 13.3,
PTT of 40.8, and INR of 1.2.  Her lungs were clear
bilaterally.  Her abdomen was soft.  Her extremities were
within normal limits.  Her sternum was intact.  She had no
neuro issues.  She started her Lasix diuresis, as well as
Lopressor and aspirin.  Pulmonary toilet was begun, and she
was transferred out to the floor.

She was seen by Case Management and worked up by Physical
Therapy to begin her ambulation.

On postoperative day two, her exam was benign.  She was
hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 142/62,
saturating 94% on four liters.  She had bibasilar rales.  Her
abdominal exam was normal.  Her wounds were clean, dry, and
intact.  Her chest tubes were discontinued, as was her Foley
catheter.  She continued to ambulate and was screened for a
rehabilitation bed.

On postoperative day three, her temporary pacing wires were
also discontinued.  Her lungs were clear and her heart was
regular in rate and rhythm, was in sinus rhythm at 70 with a
good blood pressure.  Incisions were clean, dry, intact.  She
continued to ambulate with Physical Therapy as she was being
screened.

On postoperative day four, the patient did complain of some
right upper quadrant tenderness and was seen by Surgery.  The
patient's white count was 17.  The patient had a negative
ultrasound for cholecystitis.  She remained NPO with IV
fluids, and they recommended abdominal CT.  The CT scan
showed pericholecystic fat.  The General Surgery team
continued to follow the patient.  She remained NPO on Flagyl.
She did have some tenderness and some guarding with no
rebound.  The question was whether or not she had acute
cholecystitis developing.  General Surgery continued to
follow.  She did continue to ambulate and Lasix diuresis was
held, and she continued to get her IV Lopressor.  Her
hematocrit remained stable in the 30's and her liver function
tests were normal.  Another CT scan showed a left lower lobe
infiltrate with bilateral pleural effusions and an apparent
rib fracture.

On postoperative day five, the patient was reevaluated again
by General Surgery team.  Negative laboratories showed that
it was most likely cholecystitis.  Her diet was advanced.
She had decreased pain and continued to ambulate.

On exam, her lungs were clear and wounds were clean, dry, and
intact.  Her abdomen was soft with some slight right upper
quadrant tenderness, but no rebound or guarding.  She had no
edema in her extremities.  Her hematocrit was stable.  Chest
x-ray did show a question of a left lower lobe pneumonia.
Her diet was advanced.  She continued on levofloxacin for her
pulmonary process and continued to rehabilitate on the floor
with Physical Therapy.

On[**4-10**] the patient was discharged to home in stable
condition with instructions to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]

2.  Hypertension.
3.  Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Severe peripheral vascular disease as documented with
prior fem-fem bypass and iliac stenting.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lipitor, 40 mg PO q d.
2.  Zoloft, 25 mg PO q d.
3.  Enteric coated aspirin, 325 mg PO q d.
