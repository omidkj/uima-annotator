Date of Birth:   [**2098-9-17**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year old
woman with a history of hepatic encephalopathy secondary to
alcoholic cirrhosis who was found unresponsive at her nursing
home.  The patient was tachypneic with occasional cough,
saturating in the mid 80s in room air.  EMS was called and
brought the patient to the [**Hospital1 188**], noted that the patient had vomited once in the
ambulance.  On arrival, she had a respiratory rate of 18,
oxygen saturation 87% in room air.  She was intubated for
airway protection secondary to question of emesis in route to
the hospital and altered mental status on arrival.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Alcoholic cirrhosis.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Urinary tract infection.
4.  VRE and Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus;
although the Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
history is questionable, there is a definitive known VRE
urinary tract infection.
5.  Peptic ulcer disease with upper gastrointestinal bleed.
6.  Anemia, thrombocytopenia.
7.  Hypertension.
8.  Cerebrovascular accident.
9.  Seizure disorder.
10. Dementia.
11. Diabetes mellitus.
12. Schizophrenia.
13. Depression.
14. Aspiration pneumonia.
15. Multifocal parenchymal hemorrhages.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa and Dilantin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Thiamine.
2.  Carbamazepine.
3.  Keppra.
4.  Lactulose.
5.  Perphenazine.
6.  Reglan.
7.  Folic Acid.
8.  Gabapentin.
9.  Ativan.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives at the [**Hospital 19497**]
and has a history of chronic alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission revealed a
temperature of 98.6, blood pressure 138/80, pulse 77,
respiratory rate 18, was on ventilator AC at 12 by 600 with a
FIO2 of 1.0 initially.  On physical examination, the patient
was intubated and sedated.  On head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination, her sclera were anicteric.  The pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Her neck was supple.  There was marked increased tone in all
extremities.  Cardiovascular was regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Chest was
clear to auscultation bilaterally although coarse.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.  She was
guaiac positive per the Emergency Department.  Extremities -
She showed no edema.  Neurologically, she was sedated, showed
extensor posturing in her upper and lower extremities and her
toes were upgoing.  No further neurologic examination was
possible at the time.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 7.0, hematocrit
38.7, platelet count 142,000, neutrophils 78%, lymphocytes
14%, monocytes 3%.  Her Chem7 showed a sodium of 143,
potassium 3.9, chloride 114, bicarbonate 21, blood urea
nitrogen 14, creatinine 0.7.  Partial thromboplastin time
28.3, prothrombin time 14.0, INR 1.4.  Ammonia was 215 and
lactate was 1.9.

On chest x-ray, there was only mild perihilar haziness.  CT
of the head showed a new left frontal infarct approximately
one centimeter as well as a number of old parenchymal
infarcts.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Acute mental status changes - Although the CT of the head
demonstrated small parenchymal hemorrhage for which
neurosurgery and neurology were consulted, a repeat head CT
was felt to be a nonacute infarct and unlikely to be
contributing to the acute mental status changes.  It is
unclear per the neurology consult whether this is due to
transient changes in coagulopathy or questionable amyloid
angiopathy.  No interventions were taken for this parenchymal
hemorrhage other than keeping the INR less than 1.5 and the
platelet count above 100.  Also on the acute mental status
changes, the patient's had an electroencephalogram which was
negative for seizures.  She also had a lumbar puncture which
was negative for cerebrospinal fluid pathology.  Therefore,
it was felt that the acute mental status changes were
secondary to hepatic encephalopathy given the elevated
ammonia, the triggering factor which was thought to be
urinary tract infection as the urine grew out Vancomycin
resistant Enterococcus.  For this urinary tract infection,
the patient was initially treated with Levaquin and Flagyl.
Once the Enterococcus was isolated, she was changed to
Linezolid first intravenously and now continued p.o. for
outpatient.  The encephalopathy was treated with Lactulose.

2.  Alcohol cirrhosis - The patient's encephalopathy was
treated as above.  She had an ultrasound which was negative
for ascites and demonstrated normal portal hepatic blood
flow, no evidence of hepatic or portal venous thrombosis.
The patient's ammonia level improved as did her mental status
throughout her hospital course.

3.  Respiratory failure - The patient was intubated for
airway protection.  Her mental status improved over the
hospital course and she was eventually extubated and did well
from her pulmonary status.    Her persistent wheezing is
likely secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
we are suggesting continuing the Albuterol MDI.

4.  Urinary tract infection - As noted above treated with
Linezolid for VRE.  She will complete a fourteen day course
for a complicated urinary tract infection.

5.  She had an episode of hypernatremia which resolved when
her free water deficit was replaced.

6.  Seizure disorder - The patient was maintained on
anticonvulsant.  An electroencephalogram was negative for
seizure activity.

7.  Anemia - Potentially due to slow gastrointestinal bleed
as the patient has had guaiac positive stool although no
gross blood, hematemesis or hematochezia.  It is recommended
that the patient follow-up with her primary care physician
for potential colonoscopy.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.
