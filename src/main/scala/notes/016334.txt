LABORATORY DATA:  Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] where he
underwent further evaluation prior to his CABG including PFTs
and a transthoracic echocardiogram. Lab data on admission:
White count 6.3, hematocrit 45, platelets 195. PT 12.9, PTT
27.1, INR 1.1. Sodium 138, potassium 4.8, chloride 101, C02
29, BUN 24, creatinine 1.3, glucose 82. ALT 24, AST 17,
alkaline phosphatase 94. Total bilirubin 0.6, amylase and
lipase 66/24.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2123-7-30**], the patient was brought
to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting. Please see the OR report for full details.
In summary, the patient had a CABG x 4 with LIMA to the LAD,
saphenous vein graft to the PDA, saphenous vein graft to OM1
and OM2 as well as a primary ASD closure. His bypass time was
132 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 90 minutes. He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit. At
the time of transfer the patient was in sinus rhythm at 90
beats per minute with mean arterial pressure of 90 and CVP of
7. Initial attempts to extubate the patient in the ICU were
unsuccessful; however, within the operative day the patient
was successfully weaned and extubated.

On postoperative day number one, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable. However, he continued to require Neo-
Synephrine infusion to maintain an adequate blood pressure.
Over the next several days, the patient continued to require
Neo-Synephrine infusion to maintain an adequate blood
pressure. During that time, he was noted to have intermittent
periods of atrial fibrillation for which he was started on
Amiodarone which successfully converted him to a normal sinus
rhythm. His activity level was advanced while he remained in
the intensive care unit despite the need for Neo-Synephrine
infusion.

On postoperative day number three, his chest tubes were
removed. On postoperative day number four, his temporary
pacing wires were removed. On that day he was able to be
weaned totally from his Neo-Synephrine infusion. However,
after several hours he became hypotensive and once again
restarted on his Neo-Synephrine infusion. On postoperative
day number five he was completely weaned from Neo-Synephrine.
He was monitored for 24 hours. On postoperative day number
six, he was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] II for continuing
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

The following morning, the patient completed his activity
level requirements and it was decided that he was stable and
ready to be discharged to home. At the time of this
dictation, the patient's physical examination is as follows:
Temperature 98.8, heart rate 67, sinus rhythm, blood pressure
95/58, respiratory rate 18, 02 sat 96% on room air. Weight
preoperatively 73 kilos, at discharge 73.6 kilos.

Lab data: White count 9.7, hematocrit 35.2, platelets
298,000. Sodium 138, potassium 4.5, chloride 101, C02 26, BUN
15, creatinine 1.2, glucose 99. General: Sitting comfortably
in a chair. Neurologically, alert and oriented. Moves all
extremities. Nonfocal exam. Pulmonary: Scattered rhonchi
without wheezes or rales. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm,
S1, S2, with no murmur. Sternum is stable. Incision with
Steri-Strips, without erythema or drainage. Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema.
Bilateral leg incisions via endoscopic harvest with Steri-
Strips clean and dry. Patient is to be discharged home with
visiting nurses.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
   bypass grafting x 4 with a LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein
   graft to PDA, saphenous vein graft to OM1 and OM2 as well
   as an ASD closure.
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3. Arm surgery.
