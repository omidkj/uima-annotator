History of Present Illness:
64 yo female, h/o melanoma excision, h/o DVT's, HTN,
hypothyroidism, who presented to her PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chief complaint
of fatigue. She was in her USOH until [**4-15**]; on this day, she
states that she went out walking and became extremely fatigued,
more than her baseline. Associated with this, she had an episode
of chest pressure and right foot/ankle pain and swelling. Due to
the severity of the fatigue, she made an appointment with her
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] she was seen 1 day PTA. At this visit, routine blood
work revealed a WBC of 186,000. She was referred here to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.

Other than the malaise, fatigue, she was basically asymptomatic.
The episode of chest pressure was associated with SOB, but it
has not recurred. She denies any fever/chills/night
sweats/swollen glands. She states that she has had a few
episodes of GI upset, but she denies any headaches or other
neurologic symptoms. She has noted easy bruising in the past few
weeks (notably with bruising of LLE), but no bleeding. She
started taking ASA for her LE swelling and developed the
bruising after this. She has no personal or family history of
leukemia/lymphoma. She states that she did have low WBC 13 years
ago and had a BM biopsy at that time that was normal.

An abdominal ultrasound exam on [**2186-5-4**] showed no focal or
textural abnormality in the liver and no intrahepatic or
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and bilateral pleural
effusions.

A head CT on [**2186-5-15**] was negative, but a head MRI on [**2186-5-18**]
demonstrated multifocal signal abnormalities scattered
throughout the cerebral sulci, with no evidence of septic
emboli.

A torso CT on [**2186-5-19**] demonstrated bilateral ill-defined nodular
densities within the lungs, a moderate-sized hiatal hernia, and
unusual appearance of thickened folds within the proximal small
bowel.

A repeat CT on [**2186-5-23**] demonstrated interval worsening of
multiple patchy areas of ground-glass opacity and multiple
ill-defined bilateral nodular densities within the lungs and
bilateral pleural effusions consistent with an
infectious/inflammatory
process.

A CT on [**2186-6-6**] demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli,
involving the left upper, left lower and right lower lobe.



Brief Hospital Course:
Leukemia:
On admission, peripheral smear from OSH was reviewed and
morphologically seemed to be consistent with ALL.  Bone marrow
biopsy and aspirate were performed, and results were consistent
with ALL (Ph negative, positive for translocation 4:11.  She was
initially started on Prednisone and hydrea (with allopurinol),
and WBC decreased.  Two days after admission, she had an episode
of SVT associated with chest pain and hypotension.  She was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring.  Rhythm broke
with 12.5 mg Adenosine; cardiology was consulted and felt it was
consistent with AVNRT, likely precipitated by her illness.  She
had a troponin leak to 0.09 in this setting (again, thought to
be in the setting of tachycardia.

After transfer back to the floor, she was maintained on
telemetry with a few, asymptomatic recurrences of her AVNRT.
Chemoprophylaxis (MTX and Ara-C, with hydrocortisone) was
administered on [**2186-5-9**].  She was started on chemotherapy
(vincristine, Daunorubicin, MTX, L-asparaginase, Prednisone),
and had a negative reaction to L-asp, including fever, chills,
abdominal pain and severe nausea, which was poorly controlled
with compazine, anzemet, and zyprexa.  In addition, the Pt.
experienced a change in mental status consisting of increased
somnolence and depression, which were thought to be secondary to
physical deconditioning and prolonged hospitalization.

A CT on [**2186-6-3**] demonstrated a focal filling defect within a
segmental branch of the right main pulmonary artery in the right
lower lung zone, which represented a
segmental pulmonary embolism.

The morning after the PE was discovered, the patient became
acutely hypoxic and had a brief episode of hypotension. She was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] again, and BP improved with fluids. A CT
on [**2186-6-6**] demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli, involving
the left upper, left lower and right lower lobe, which was felt
to be a possible etiology for her worsening respiratory status.
Due to her thrombocytopenia, the decision whether or not to
anticoagulate was debated, and a decision was made to place an
IVC filter to prevent further DVT -> PE, and she was placed on a
heparin gtt with a plan to continue for 72 hours. However, the
pt's respiratory status continued to decline. CXR was felt to be
possibly c/w fluid overload, and the pt was given over 120mg IV
lasix and UOP was more than 6L, but she remained with worsening
respiratory status on BiPAP. The family was called in and
together they made the decision to make the pt's status DNR/DNI.
Her clinical course continued to decline and she was later made
CMO. The family declined autopsy.
