History of Present Illness:
HPI: 82 year old female with HTN, CHF, AAA s/p repair '[**43**]
presenting with severe headache and substernal chest pressure.
She states that headache is similar to past hypertensive
headache. She was hospitalized with similar presentation in
[**4-3**]. Patient reports 3 days of shortness of breath. Her son
brought her to [**Name (NI) **].
.
Patient states she has been short of breath for 3 days and seems
to be gradually worsening. Per her sister, she was unable to
afford her spiriva and hasn't been taking for at least a few
days. Additionally, it appears that her advair is out of
medication and has been taking an empty inhaler for
indeterminate number of days. It does seem that medication
compliance may be an issue as sister states that med doses are
missed at times and she may have run out of her prilosec.
.
She complains of "whole body pain." This includes sub-xiphoid
pain tender to palpation, crampy upper abdominal pain, pain
under her left breast which she states she sometimes gets under
right breast (unclear whether this happens at baseline),
bilateral leg pain and lower back pain at baseline which patient
and family say is not well controlled on her home pain regimen.
She denies that the chest or abdominal pain radiates to back
(although back pain is present and seems baseline). Some mild
leg swelling also noted.
.
ROS: no fevers, chills, (+) constipation and bloating with abd
discomfort.
.
ED: Blood pressure 210/104. given compazine and hydralazine 10mg
iv x 2 without effect, then started on nipride gtt. With nipride
gtt, her blood pressure decreased quickly to 130's systolic and
drip held then restarted with similar blood pressure drop. CXR
negative. EKG unchanged from prior. A-line was attempted in ED
but patient refused after 2 attempts.

CXR:
AP view of the chest in upright position. The cardiac silhouette
demonstrates left ventricular configuration. Again noted,
prominent main pulmonary artery, unchanged. The aorta is
tortuous. The lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax or
pleural effusion. The osseous structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly. No CHF or pneumonia.

Head CT:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage,
shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation appears grossly preserved.
Visualized paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 82 year old female with CHF, AAA s/p repair in [**2143**], HTN,
hyperlipidemia presenting with hypertensive emergency (HA).

1. HTN urgency - This was felt to be possibly in the setting of
non-compliance with meds (per pt's sister's report). She
required a transient nitro gtt but this dropped her BP too
quickly so she was transferred to the ICU for overnight
monitoring.  The headache was most likely secondary to HTN
(negative head CT) and subsequently resolved.  In addition to
noncompliance, patient was found to be mildly volume overloaded
with elevated JVP, LE edema and crackles at bilateral bases (CXR
was unimpressive for fluid overload).  She was restarted on her
home medications and actively diuresed with IV lasix.  The
patient had systolics in the 140s upon transfer to the floor.
The next day the patient had decreased urine output and her
creatinine increased to 1.7.  The patient was also orthostatic
and had BP in the 100s.  This was felt to be attributed to
aggressive diuresis as well as starting back all of her
anti-hypertensive meds concomitantly.  The lasix and ACE-I were
held for one day and the patient was given one liter of NS with
subsequent adequate urine output and return of serum creatinine
to 0.9.  As of dishcarge teh patient is back on her home regimen
and tolerating this well with controlled HTN.  There was some
concern on this admission that the patient, who is markedly
visually impaired, was not taking the proper meds at home and
upon discharge from rehab will need close VNA care.

2. SOB/increased WOB - CXR on admit negative for PNA, no
localizing symptoms.
The patient's meds were reviewed and it appears that she has
been "using" her advair for quite some time but this was clearly
empty.  Additionally the patient had not refilled her spiriva
because it was too expensive.  She was placed back on her home
regimen, given PRN nebs and her symptoms resolved on hospital
day #2.

3.  Chest pain - This was reproducible on exam and in setting of
whole body pain, was felt to be less likely of cardiac etiology.
She had no acute changes on her EKG and ruled out for MI by
three sets of negative CEs.  Of note, patient has had a history
of multiple PACs, PVCs but not documented AFib.  During my exam
one morning I felt the patient was in Afib and a 12-lead EKG was
obtained which confirmed this.  She has been adequately
rate-controlled on her labetalol regimen.  Later that afternoon
the patient was found to be back in NSR (as seen on telemetry).
Given her severely impaired gait, weakness and poor [**Year (4 digits) **]
acuity it was felt that the risks of anticoagulation outweigh
the benefits at this time.  This was discussed with both the
patient and her son and can be readdressed by her PCP upon
discharge from rehab.

4. cataracts/glaucoma - cont eye drops

5.  chronic pain - Patient was continued on oxycodone prn, add
lidocaine patch to low back (as do not have her home topical
cream regimen in our pharmacy).
