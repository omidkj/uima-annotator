Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with history of atrial fibrillation, DM2, prior
MI presents s/p PEA arrest at an OSH after VATS.
.
Patient is intubated and unresponsive on arrival, history is
obtained from outside records.
.
In early [**Month (only) 359**], he had a sore throat and felt poorly. He went
to his PCP and was treated with 10 days of ammoxicillin. he then
was treated with penicillin for a dental extraction. Shortly
after this, he became progressively short of breath. He saw his
PCP who referred him to Cardiology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77919**]. At that
time a CXR was performed that showed opacification of the right
lower [**12-9**] to [**12-8**] hemithorax, interpreted as infiltrate + pleural
effusion. He also had a stress echocardiogram and a cardiac
catheterization was planned. A chest X-ray was repeated on
[**2126-10-28**], which was unchanged. His cath was deferred and he was
scheduled to undergo VATS with possible pleural decortication.
.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 26615**] on [**2126-10-30**] for VATS and
bronchoscopy. 2600 cc of straw colored pleural fluid was
removed, and pleural biopsy was taken. At the end of the
procedure, prior to extubation, patient had a drop in blood
pressure and suffered a PEA arrest. Patient received
defibrillation, epinephrine, and chest compresions for 17
minutes. He returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm, and was transferred
to the ICU. He was put on a lasix drip. There an echo
demonstrated no pericardial effusion, and and CT PA demonstrated
no PE. His labs were significant for a WBC of 12. Cardiac
enzymes were flat. He was treated with levaquin and unasyn for
presumed PNA. He was weaned off of sedation and only responded
to noxious stimuli. He was evaluated by neurology who
recommended MRI and EEG. He is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
cardiology and neurology evaluation. On transfer, he was on a
heparin drip, midazolam/fentanyl for sedation and mechanical
ventilation (AC).

EEG: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of a
low-voltage background that was invariant and nonreactive to
external
stimulation. This finding suggests a diffuse and severe
encephalopathy,
such as that caused by hypoxic-ischemic injury, toxic-metabolic
changes,
or medication effect, among other things. There were no focal
abnormalities or epileptiform features noted.
.
PCXR: The ET tube tip is 5.2 cm above the carina. The NG tube
tip passes below the diaphragm with its tip being in the
stomach.
Diffuse pericardial calcification is noted, circumferential.
Mediastinum is minimally widened but it might be related to
portable technique of the study.  There is minimal vascular
congestion but no overt edema. Left retrocardiac opacity might
represent area of atelectasis, aspiration or infectious process
and should be closely monitored.
.
TTE: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior, inferolateral,
and anterolateral hypokinesis. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, additional focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40%). Unable to assess left ventricular
diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.
.
MR HEAD W/ and W/O CON:
1. Extensive confluent areas of decreased diffusion in the
bilateral parietal and occipital [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] and parts of the frontal
lobes likely related to cortical infarction with some degree of
cortical swelling. Spreading of the temporal lobes, the basal
ganglia and the right cerebellar hemisphere and probably the
left cerebellar hemisphere. Correlate clinically and consider
followup/correlation with brain scan.
2. Area of increased signal intensity on the T2 and FLAIR
sequences in the
right frontal [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] relate to changes in the parenchyma
surrounding small developmental venous anomaly. However, given
the lack of prior studies and the extent of FLAIR hyperintense
area, which measures 2.1 x 2.6 cm, consider followup to assess
stability/progression to exclude any associated low-grade
neoplasm.
3. Mucosal thickening in the mastoid air cells on both sides,
right more than left.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. s/p PEA arrest. Post-op/peri anesthesia hypotension most
likely precipitant of PEA. Possible contribution from hypoxia
given lung collapse seen on CT. CT PA negative for PE, echo
negative for tamponade. Labs essentially normal, cardiac enzymes
negative. Neurology consulted and EEG and MRI head done, all
consistent with very poor neurologic prognosis. Neurology team
explained prognosis to patient's family and they agreed that it
would not be within his wishes to exist without meaningful
interaction. NEOB was initially contact[**Name (NI) **] but pt. was no longer
a possible donor once extubated.
.
# Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion: Patient was never
extubated post-thoracentesis. Continued levaquin and unasyn
