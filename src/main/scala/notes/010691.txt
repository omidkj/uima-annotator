History of Present Illness:
The pt is a  23 y/o man who comes in with one day history of
confusion. He was well until about 2 weeks ago when he started
to complain of flu like symptoms, staying home and not going out
with his friends for about 4-5 days. By Monday of last week he
felt [**Doctor Last Name **] and was able to go to work without a problem. At the
end of the week he went to [**Doctor Last Name 9437**] to go snowboarding and then came
back to [**Location (un) 86**] on Sunday for the NFL game. He drove back to
Woster, MA without a problem but was complaining of some body
aches on Monday. By Monday evening he was noted to be napping
(although not abnormal for him) and needed help getting to his
room (up the stairs) as he was lethargic, and on level ground he
was having a shuffling type gait. He was placed in bed and his
mother checked on him at night. She noted that he was
unsettled/"thrashing" so she opened the door and then he awoke
and stared to scream. SHe consoled him but when his dad came in
he was startled again and started to scream. He then quieted
down and then the next morning he was noted to be in bed, unable
to get up, unable to answer questions, and had inappropriate
laughter. He was then taken to [**Hospital6 **] and
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 **] ED. Here in the ED he is awake
but non-verbal and unable to give me any history. His mom notes
that he had not complain of any rashes, bug or animal bites.
They have a parakeet at home. He has one brother at home who is
not sick. There has been no recent travel outside the states,
but he did go to [**State **] last year.


Past Medical History:
Cleft palate which was surgically corrected
Murmur in childhood

Social History:
Parents state that he has smoked marijuana, drinks etoh
occasionally, and have seen pictures of him with a cigarette.
They think he is sexually active but believe he wears condoms.


Family History:
No history of meningitis, early strokes.

extremities he was not able to hold up his legs, and his heel
slid back down when flexed at the knee, His quads were
appreciated as 3- on the left and 2+ on the right. He wiggles
his
toes.

-Sensory: he withdrew to pin-prick but not vigorously.

Abdomen: soft, NT/ND.
Extremities: No edema or deformities.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Awake and alert, trach in place but able to say
a few words with Passy-Muir valve. Comprehension intact, follows
commands well.

left. Strong hand grasps, R>L. Able to provide some resistance
in biceps, triceps, [**3-16**].
Able to lift legs anti-gravity off bed, [**2-13**] in IP's. Full
strength distally, wiggles toes b/l.

Reports:
CSF Cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Hypercellular
specimen with lymphocytes, some with reactive features, and
monocytes.

EEG [**2175-1-3**]: This is an abnormal video EEG monitoring session
because of
very frequent electrographic seizures from bifrontal and left or
right
frontal regions. These frequent electrographic seizures are
nearly
continuous at the beginning of the recording and are consistent
with
non-convulsive status epilepticus. The background between
seizures and
after administration of intravenous lorazepam shows
predominantly theta
activity with excess beta activity indicative of a medication
effect and
moderate diffuse encephalopathy.

EEG [**2175-1-4**]:  This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring
study which
captured three pushbutton activations, one of which was for left
arm
extensor posturing during which diffuse delta frequency activity
was
seen without evolution and there was no evidence of
electrographic
seizure activity with any of the pushbuttons. There were
frequent
generalized, but left greater than right frontal spike and wave
epileptiform discharges, indicative of an epileptogenic focus in
the
left frontal region with rapid spread. The background showed
mixed
frequency activity with excess beta activity and frequent bursts
of
delta activity and generalized suppression. These findings are
indicative of a moderate to severe diffuse encephalopathy, and
the
excess beta activity was likely a reflection of medication
effects.
There were no electrographic seizures.

EEG [**2175-1-5**]: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring
study due to
the slow and disorganized background with excess beta activity
indicative of an encephalopathy. There were frequen
