Endotracheal intubation.


History of Present Illness:
48 yo F h/o cocaine abuse, MVP, p/w multiple complaints,
including syncope, chest and abdominal pain. Pt states that she
noticed substernal chest pain that worsened in the few weeks
prior to admission and was elicited by climbing the stairs to
her apartment. CP was relieved with rest. She also noted that

[**2143-10-13**] CTA Abd/Chest/pelvis: Pancreatic edema and intra-
abdominal free fluid consistent with mild pancreatitis. Please
note that the amount of intra-abdominal free fluid cannot be
explained by this mild degree of pancreatitis.  Multiple
findings consistent with congestive heart failure/volume
overload including bilateral ground-glass opacities within the
upper and lower lung, interlobular septal thickening,
heterogeneous perfusion of the liver, and a large amount of
intra-abdominal ascites.
Bilateral lower lung lobe consolidations which could represent
bilateral aspiration. Small amount of subsegmental atelectasis
at the lung bases bilaterally. Right mainstem bronchus
intubation. Two cystic masses within the left ovary may
represent simple cysts, however definitive characterization is
difficult with a large amount of intrapelvic ascites. A pelvic
ultrasound is recommended when this patient's clinical status
improves.

[**2143-10-13**] transthoracic [**Month/Day/Year 461**]: The left atrium is normal
in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are  normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global
hypokinesis. Systolic function of apical segments is relatively
preserved (suggesting a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least moderate to
severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.  The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be estimated. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2143-10-15**] Abd CT: Small amount of fluid surrounding the head of
the pancreas may related to mild pancreatitis, per given
history. No peripancreatic fluid collections and homogeneous
pancreatic parenchymal enhancement.
Right lower lobe consolidation, likely pneumonia. Small
associated pleural effusions and atelectasis. Trace ascites and
periportal edema. Simple left renal cyst.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5749**] is a 48 year-old female with a history significant for
cocaine use who presented with two to three weeks of increasing
dyspnea on exertion and angina particularly when climbing
stairs. She reported abdominal pain, cocaine use and subsequent
syncopal episode within 24 hours of being seen in the Emergency
Department. She was febrile to 101 in the ED, with an initial
lactate of 4.7 and  evidence of pneumonia on CT. She became
hemodynamically unstable in the Emergency Department which
required endotracheal intubation for airway protection,
aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressors. EKG demonstrated
T-wave inversions in leads III and V1. The patient was found to
have elevated cardiac markers and severely decreased ejection
fraction (20%). She was admitted to the MICU for further
management.  Her troponin and MB-index peaked at 0.39 and 4.7,
respectively.  Given these findings, it was felt that cardiac
ischemia in the setting of cocaine use caused a new
cardiomyopathy (or worsening of an underlying cardiomyopathy)
and resulted in cardiogenic shock. She was started on aspirin
and a statin, but a beta-blocker was avoided initially due to
recent cocaine use. A heparin drip was not initiated during this
hospitalization because her picture was not consistent with ACS.
Alternatively, septic shock was considered as a possible cause
of a new cardiomyopathy. She was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics and pan-cultured, but all cultures were negative.
When she became hemodynamically stable, after-load reduction was
achieved with diuresis and she was extubated without
complication. She was then transferred to the floor and repeat
ECHO demonstrated an EF of 35%. A complete work-up for
