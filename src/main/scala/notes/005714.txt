HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year-old
white male with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial
fibrillation, transitional cell carcinoma who presented with
right sided weakness on the day of admission.  Per his family
he was unable to get out of bed.  No loss of consciousness or
chest pain, just profound right sided weakness.  Upon arrival
at [**Hospital1 69**] he was found to have
elevated cardiac enzymes.  Head MRI showed watershed infarct
in ACA-MCA territory.  According to the patient's family he
has been alert and active at baseline, although they have
noticed overall slowing of his thought processes in the last
few months.  Additionally, for the last few months he has had
decreasing dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea.  Recent
echocardiogram on [**1-28**] showed global hypokinesis with an EF
of approximately 20% with chamber dilation.  His cardiologist
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had planned for cardiac catheterization this week.
Additionally he has had a large right pleural effusion as far
back as [**2150-11-18**].  He also had evidence of ventricular
tachycardia per outpatient Holter monitor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Dilated cardiomyopathy with congestive
heart failure, conduction abnormalities with intermittent
left bundle branch block, right bundle branch block pattern.
Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, pituitary adenoma with a history of resection
and secondary hypopituitarism.  Transitional cell carcinoma
of the bladder status post bladder sparing protocol, recent
two cycles of Carboplatin and Gemcitabine.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.3.  Pulse 84 to 120s.
Blood pressure 140s/80s.  Respiratory rate 30s.  Sat 94% on 6
liters nasal cannula.  In general, he is alert and oriented
times three.  HEENT unequal pupils right greater then left.
No lymphadenopathy.  No JVD.  Pulmonary decreased breath
sounds on right crackles bilaterally.  Heart S1 and S2,
irregularly irregular with a 2 out of 6 systolic murmur.
Abdomen soft, nontender, active bowel sounds.  Extremities no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Toes down going.  Neurological
cranial nerves II through XII, right hemiparesis, muscle
strength right upper extremity strength markedly decreased
unable to move, right lower extremity strength intact, left
upper extremity and left lower extremity.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 12.1, hematocrit 37.5,
platelets 206, mean corpuscular volume 83, INR 1.2, sodium
143, potassium 3.4, chloride 104, bicarb 27, BUN 21,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 100, digoxin level 1.4, calcium 9.9,
magnesium 2.1, phosphorus 3.4, CK 272, MB 26, MBI 4.6,
troponin 14.3.  Electrocardiogram atrial fibrillation at 100
alternating right bundle branch block with left bundle branch
block pattern.  Chest CT large right pleural effusion,
infiltrates with consolidation in right upper lobe right
middle lobe small infiltrate left lower lobe.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit with transfer on hospital day two to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service.

1.  Cardiovascular:  On admission the patient presented with
elevated cardiac enzymes.  He was placed on heparin for an
acute coronary syndrome.  It was thought he most likely had
cardioembolic phenomenon leading to his left watershed
infarct.  His troponins were followed in house and trended
down.  Possible catheterization was discussed, however, given
his recent cerebrovascular accident it was concluded that
catheterization would be best in approximately four weeks.
He was started on beta blocker, which was titrated to
maintain adequate cerebral perfusion while maximizing heart
rate control.  His Coumadin was restarted in house.  Until
his INR becomes therapeutic he will continue heparin.  He
will follow up as an outpatient with cardiologist Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **].  After catheterization is done he will be
considered for a possible pacemaker and defibrillator
placement.

2.  Neurology:  The patient presented with right hemiparesis
secondary to left watershed infarct.  It was thought he most
likely had a cardioembolic stroke.  The Neurology Service
followed.  Follow up head CT was done, which showed no
evidence of bleed or significant change from prior study.
While in house he regained some right sided motility.
Physical therapy consulted, speech therapy consulted
regarding expressive aphagia.  He will continue
rehabilitation at [**Hospital1 **] Acute Rehab Center.

3.  Pulmonary:  On admission chest CT was done, which showed
consistent pleural effusion as well as congestive heart
failure and possible aspiration pneumonia.  Given slightly
elevated white blood cell count as well as low grade
temperature and decreased oxygen sats he was started on
Levaquin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
Throughout his hospital stay he remained afebrile and his
oxygen saturation improved to 98% on room air.  Swallow
evaluation was done, which showed he was no longer an
aspiration risk.

4.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  While in house he
required q.d. potassium and magnesium replacement.  His
electrolytes will need to be followed at the rehab center and
replaced prn.  He tolerated thick liquid soft mechanical diet
well.

5.  Endocrine:  The patient with a history of pituitary
adenoma now with pan hypopituitarism.  On admission he was
started on stress dosed steroids, which was tapered while in
house.  He will complete his taper of intravenous
Hydrocortisone and change to Prednisone 4 mg po q.d. per
discharge instructions.
