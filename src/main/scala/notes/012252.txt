History of Present Illness:
37F with history of lupus, lupus nephritis with ESRD on
peritoneal dialysis on transplant list, hx of PE/Antiphopholipid
antibody on coumadin, mitral regurg, presents with 4-6 month
history of cough, worse in the morning, one week of trace blood,
now producing bright red blood over last couple days. Patient
states that the amount of blood she has been coughing has been
increasing and is now almost hourly, aprroximately 1 teaspoon
bright red blood. Patient states that the cough produced
primarily yellow sputum until it turned to blood. Patient denies
any other symptoms such as dizziness or lightheadedness. She
denies any changes in her BMs, including consistency, frequency,
and color.  Patient visited PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**], and a CXR was
negative. Her was also noted to be subtherapeutic and she took
an extra day of 10 mg warfarin as instructed.
.
Initial vitals in the ED were: 108 138/95 18 100% RA. Her HCT
was 29.6, her baseline is unclear but appears to be low 30s. INR
was 4.4. A CTA was done for concern of PE which showed: 1. Left
lower lobe consolidation with large amount of secretions/fluid
within the left lower lobe segmental bronchi. 2. Centrilobular
nodules and ground glass opacities throughout both lungs,
compatible with chronic collagen vascular disease, progressed
since [**2191**]. Ground glass opacities could also represent
hemorrhage. 3. Chronic left lower segmental pulmonary arterial
PE, unchanged since [**2191**].  No new acute PE detected to the
subsegmental levels.  She was initially admitted to medicine but
then transferred to the ICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU initial vitals were: 110 163/96 20 95%RA.
She is breathing comfortably but complains of pain in her chest.
Her EKG was reviewed which did not show changes from her prior.
She also complains of a HA that she says she occasionally
recieves toradol. She has had emesis in the ED that looked
dark/possibly coffee ground but currently denies nausea.
