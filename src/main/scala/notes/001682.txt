Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
70M sent from [**Hospital1 1501**] w/ h/o recent PNA, as well as CHF, COPD
presents after noted to be dyspneic and hypoxic at [**Hospital1 1501**]. Room air
sat on arrival was low 80s, was given O2, Steroids, Bipap, and
rose to 90s-100s. HR initially 130s-> improved to 110s.
Transiently dropped pressure to 80s, but came up spontaneously.
Gas 7.31/67/85 on Bipap. Pt adamantly refused intubation in ED,
initially agreed to short term BIPAP, refusing after short trial
in MICU. He states his breathing currently feels well. Pt states
he has 4 sons, but he wants to make his own medical decisions,
and is very clear that he does not want intubation. He denies
any recent fever, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain. He has
lower back pain where is he noted to have diffusely macerated
skin. Initial trial at foley insertion with pus returned. Pt
states he has chronic indwelling foley after past surgery.
.
In ED labs significant for BNP 3800, elevated troponin with Cr
1.0, although prior hx of renal failure. Also noted to have RBBB
on EKG, but no STT changes per ED. CXR limited by motion. Given
Vanco/levo in ED in addition to 20mg lasix IV.
.
Pt refused intubation in ED, prior documentation at rehab with
full code.

Note he was admitted to OSH mid [**Month (only) 116**] to [**2117-5-17**] after being found
on floor in feces. Treated that admit for ARF, hepatitis,
pneumonia.

Skin ulcers


Social History:

recently.

Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:

GENERAL: elderly, obese male, mild respiratory distress, awaker,
fully oriented, coherent
HEENT: OP clear, anicteric, L nares with some fresh bleeding
NECK: full neck, unable to examine for JVD
CARDIOVASCULAR: regular tachycardic, no murmurs
LUNGS: diffuse wheezes, no crackles
ABDOMEN: obese, non-distended, non-tender
BACK: large area of erythema, macerated skin, and ulceration
starting at coccyx
EXTREMITIES:
NEURO: AAOx3, moves all extremities


Pertinent Results:
EKG: irregular, tachycardic, RBBB, no ST changes or T wave
changes (same as previous read at prior hospitalization)
.
Admission CXR: very poor quality, lung volumes are low. There is
likely a left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. No
large pneumothorax is identified.

.
CXR [**6-1**]: AP semiupright view.  Evaluation is limited by patient
positioning and body habitus.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours
are unchanged.  There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions,
left greater than right, and basilar atelectasis, unchanged
compared to the previous study.
IMPRESSION:  Limited study. No interval change
.
R LENI [**5-28**]: IMPRESSION:  Limited study secondary to patient
body habitus.  No evidence of DVT seen within the right common
femoral, proximal superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.
.
Head CT [**5-24**]:
FINDINGS:  Patient motion and positioning within the scanner
somewhat limits assessment.  No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage
is clearly identified.  There is no mass effect or shift of
normally midline structures.  The ventricles do not demonstrate
any hydrocephalus.  The basal cisterns are visualized. Paranasal
sinuses appear clear.  The patient is edentulous.  Soft tissue
structures appear unremarkable.
.
IMPRESSION:  Limited study.  No obvious intracranial hemorrhage
or mass
effect.
.
Note added at attending review: There is an incompletely
visualized expansile mass in the left maxillary alveolar ridge
and there is a partially calcified mass in the left frontal
sinus. Ct scan of the facial bones suggested.
.
CT Sinus, prelim read: 2.4 x 1.4 cm expansile mass in the left
maxillary alveolar ridge.  There is thinning of the cortical
margins and areas of focal dehiscense.  The findings may be
consistent with an ameloblastoma.  Partially calcified mass in
the left frontal sinus. Right maxillary and ethmoid sinus
mucosal thickening.
.
TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or  color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The  left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a  focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular  cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary  artery systolic pressure is normal. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
COPD exacerbation -  Initially admitted to the MICU. No previous
available ABG values, however initial ABG with partly
compensated respiratory acidosi
