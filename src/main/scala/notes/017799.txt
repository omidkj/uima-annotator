Allergies:
Latex / Vancomycin / Sudafed / IVIG

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**]
Chief Complaint:
Left transverse patella fracture
Acute Respiratory Distress likely due to pneumonia and pulmonary
edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2120-12-11**]: Open reduction internal fixation with K-wires in
a figure-of-eight cerclage wire construct


History of Present Illness:
64 yo female with history of metastatic breast cancer to bone
and brain, SVC thrombus on lovenox for many years,
hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent pneumonias with recent CAP
in [**11-11**] treated with levofloxacin who was transferred from St.
[**Doctor First Name **] for left parapatellar fracture.  The patient underwent a
left patellar ORIF today in the OR.  The procedure was quick and
noninvasive with a superficial incision and minimal blood loss
under general anesthesia.  She received 1L of fluid and
cefazolin peri-operatively.
.
Tonight, on the floor, she had the acute onset of dypsnea and
tachypnea, with a sudden desaturation to the 70's and
tachycardia to the 110's.  She was placed on 5L but was still in
the low 80's, so she was given a NRB.  She had finished eating
[**Country 1073**] for dinner but denies any cough or choking event.  She
missed one dose prior to surgery.  She describes five days of
cough with sputum production since admission to St. [**Doctor First Name **].  She
also reports associated nausea and some vomiting with her
symptoms.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she is tachypneic and anxious.  She
finds her left leg and the immobilization brace to be extremely
uncomfortable.


Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
Metastatic breast cancer:
- [**2106**]: diagnosed at stage IV with mets to lymph nodes and

patient developed significant diarrhea as well as pneumonia;
lapatinib was discontinued
- [**5-/2119**]: started zolendronate again

old cerebellar met, which had been radiated.
- continued on fulvestrant every month and trastuzumab every
three weeks; zolendronate being held due to recent tooth pull

Social History:
She is married. She lives with her husband. [**Name (NI) **] daughter and

years, but quit ~30 years ago. She admits to occasional alcohol

Family History:
Her daughter had breast cancer at 29, and had a recurrence. Her
neice also had breast cancer. Her brother had lung cancer. She
denies any other family history of lung cancer.

[**12-12**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Bibasilar pneumonia
.
[**12-13**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. A patent foramen
ovale is present. A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial
septum is seen at rest. The estimated right atrial pressure is
at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 65%). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

The inferior vena cava is massively dilated. The entrance of the
inferior vena cava into the right atrium is narrowed with
extrinsic compression and possibly intraluminal mass/thrombus as
well.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2120-6-19**], a right-to-left shunt across a patent foramen
ovale is present. The right ventricle is similarly dilated, with
at least moderate pulmonary hypertension. The findings suggest
acute-on-chronic right ventricular afterload excess consistent
with venous thromboembolic phenomena, pulmonary lymphangitic
spread of breast cancer, pulmonary parenchymal disease,
.
[**12-13**] CTA chest: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic injury.
2. Bibasilar ground-glass opacification concerning for
aspiration versus
pneumonia.
3. 3-mm calcified nodule in the right upper lung (2, 13), stable
compared to
the prior PET-CT of [**2120-9-20**].
4. Upper lobe bronchus appears to arise directly from the
trachea (2, 13) and
may represent normal variant anatomy.
5. Large hiatal hernia.
6. Fluid-filled esophagus.
7.
