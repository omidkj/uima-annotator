Radiographic Studies:
Lumbar Drain Placement ([**8-13**]): IMPRESSION: Successful fluoro
guided lumbar drain placement. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], the attending
neurointerventionalist, was present supervising throughout the
entire procedure.

CTA([**8-22**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Massive bilateral pulmonary emboli.
2. Right atrium and right ventricle appear dilated. Although CT
cannot
definitively diagnose right heart strain, these findings are
supportive of the patient's known right heart strain on EKG.
3. Non-specific ground-glass opacities in the right upper and
left lower
lobes are likely related to pulmonary emboli.
4. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis of the thoracic
spine.

Lower Extremity Doppler Study:
FINDINGS: There is normal compressibility, waveform, color
Doppler signal,
and augmentation of the lower extremity veins from the level of
the common
femoral through the tibial veins.

Cardiac Echo([**8-25**]):
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-10mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is markedly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-Surgery/Standing Lumbar Films([**8-26**]):
Four radiographs of the lumbar spine demonstrate the patient to
be status post L4-L5 posterior metallic spinal fusion and L4
laminectomy. When compared to [**2151-6-11**], the fusion is new.
There is partial interval reduction of the  L4-L5
anterolisthesis seen on [**2151-6-11**]. 4-5 mm of anterolisthesis are
present at L4-L5. A radiolucent intervertebral body spacer is
seen at L4-L5. Hip and sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.
Symphysis pubis is normal. The AP view suggests the L4-L5
intervertebral body spacer device is to the right of midline.
Correlation with surgical history is requested.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted and brought to the OR electively where under
genaeral anesthesia he underwent PLIF L4-5.  He tolerated this
procedure well but due to length of case remained intubated post
op.  he had dural leak intra-op that was repaired.  He was
transferred to SICU. He was kept flat bedrest.  In attempt to
extubate on POD#1, HOB was elevated and shortly thereafter,
wound was draining what appeared to be CSF.  He was taken to IR
for placement of lumbar drain.  Lumbar drain was not functioning
well and this was revised in OR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] on POD#2.  He was
extubated later that day without difficulty.  His motor exam was
full strength.  His dressing/wound was monitored, lumbar drain
output was controlled. On [**8-21**], the lumbar drain was
removed, as surgical incision remained dry.
On [**8-22**], while getting up from bed for the first time
after remaining on bedrest for his dural tear, patient became
acutely dyspneic, diaphoretic, tachycardic, and hemodynamically
unstable.  He was emergently escorted back to the bed, when an
EEG, and cardiac consult was emergently obtained.  EEG revlead
right heart strain, and patient was emergently taken to CT scan
for CTA to evaluate for pulmonary embolus.  Massive pulmonary
embolus was identified, and patient was begun on systemic weight
based heparin protocol.  He was transferred to the ICU for
closer managment during his acute episode and remain in the ICU
until [**8-24**].  He had post op xrays that should good alignment.
His incision was well healed and staples were removed.  He was
begun on coumadin and heparin was maintained until coumadin
reached therapeutic goal.  He was seen by PT and cleared for
home.  He was tolerating all PO meds.
