Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with AF on coumadin, HTN, chronic systolic CHF who presents
with hematochezia, now with hypotension and continued BRBPR with
no response to PRBC transfusion.
.
# GI bleed: Most likely diverticular bleed in setting of
supratherapeutic INR given hematochezia, h/o tics, painless,
dramatic blood loss which self-terminates. Brisk UGIB must also
be considered, but no risk factors for varices, no known PUD or
recent NSAIDs. Undiagnosed malignancy could also be underlying
cause, though no primary mass seen on recent CT. Other potential
lower sources include hemorrhoidal, AVM, Dieulafoy lesion. Now
hypotensive, likely from blood loss. Given goals of care and
patient not wishing to have excessive procedures, will favor
close monitoring for now vs intervention.  HCT has remained
relatively stable without further blood products on the floor.
No frank bleeding on BMs.
.
# Hypotension: Most likely hypovolemic shock in the setting of
acute blood loss. WBC is elevated but most likely represents
stress response in setting of GIB and not distributive process
d/t septic shock. Warm and well-perfused on exam makes
cardiogenic shock less likely despite known impaired EF, only on
2L NC s/p aggressive volume resuscitation. Pressors currently
running peripherally. Fluid responsive at OSH. No further
episodes of hypotension when on the floor, however
anti-hypertensives held on the floor except for carvedilol.
Should continue to hold Anti-htn medications until patient is
able to follow up with PCP.
.
# AF: Now v-paced on EKG. CHADS2=3, on coumadin as outpt.
Considering bleed, discussed with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], and family and
decision was made to stop coumadin and start ASA 81 instead.
.
# CHF: appears euvolemic on exam, was volume low initially. Will
continue with Carvedilol, however will hold other CHF meds so
that they may be re-started as an outpatient.
.
# HTN: normortensive while she was on the floor, however given
her hypovolemia, decision was made to hold anti-hypertensives
except for carvedilol.  These should be re-started as an
outpatient after discussing with her PCP.
