Admission Date:  [**2104-9-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-9-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**2028-9-17**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CT [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
male with an initial complaint of shortness of breath.  He
had an initial cardiac catheterization, which revealed three
vessel heart disease and an ejection fraction of 40%.  The
patient also had an aortic valve gradient of 0.7 as well as a
40 mmHg gradient.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Back surgery in the [**2053**].
4.  Prostate retention.
5.  Bilateral lower extremity vein stripping.
6.  Renal cyst.
7.  History of pneumonia, requiring hospitalization.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
Plendil 5 mg p.o. q.d.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Valium 5 mg p.o. p.r.n.
Mevacor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  On admission, the patient
had a temperature of 97.7??????F, a pulse of 75, a blood pressure
of 145/83, respirations of 20 and an oxygen saturation of 95%
on room air.  The cardiovascular examination was a regular
rate and rhythm.  The respiratory examination was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender
and nondistended.  The extremities had no peripheral edema
and palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
cardiothoracic surgery service on [**2104-9-10**].  On [**2104-9-11**],
the patient had a lower extremity Doppler, which showed no
upper saphenous vein on the right or left.

On [**2104-9-12**], the patient was transported to the operating
room with the initial diagnosis of three vessel heart
disease.  He had coronary artery bypass grafting times three
and an aortic valve replacement with a 23 [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
valve.  The vein grafts included:  a left internal mammary
artery graft to the left anterior descending artery, a vein
graft to the obtuse marginal artery and a right radial artery
graft to the right posterior descending artery.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the post
anesthesia care unit in stable condition.

On [**2104-9-14**], the pulmonary service was consulted because of
increasing respiratory difficulty.  The pulmonary consultant
recommended that we start the patient on Levaquin
empirically, follow arterial blood gases and continue
nebulizer treatments every two to four hours.  The patient
continued to desaturate.  He had increased shortness of
breath, requiring intubation.

On [**2104-9-15**], the patient was transfused with two units of
packed red blood cells secondary to a decreased hematocrit.
The renal service was also consulted because of increasing
BUN and creatinine and symptoms consistent with acute renal
failure.  The renal consultant's assessment and plan included
maintaining the systolic blood pressure over 100, continuing
diuresis and changing Levaquin to q.o.d.

On [**2104-9-17**], the patient's renal status was improving and
the renal department stated that they would follow the
patient from a distance.

On [**2104-9-18**], the patient was transfused with another unit of
packed red blood cells and platelets were noted to be less
than 100.  The patient continued to do well and was
extubated.  Later that day, the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital Ward Name **].

On [**2104-9-19**], the platelets were at 28,000.  The hematology
service was consulted and concluded that the thrombocytopenia
was most likely due to heparin induced thrombocytopenia.  The
hematology consultant recommended following the platelets
closely and indicated that they would also follow the
patient.

The urology service also saw the patient on the same day
because of accidental removal of the Foley catheter by the
patient.  The urology consultant concluded that there was no
acute damage and that the patient could follow up as an
outpatient.

On [**2104-9-21**], the patient's status was improving and his
ambulating was increasing.  On [**2104-9-22**], the decision was
made to discharge the patient to rehabilitation.  Due to the
platelet counts, which were still at 27,000, the wires were
cut instead of being pulled.

On [**2104-9-23**], the patient continued to improve and do well
and was set up to be discharged to rehabilitation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  On discharge, the patient
had a temperature of 98??????F, a pulse of 79, a blood pressure of
120/64, a respiratory rate of 18 and an oxygen saturation of
95% on room air.  The cardiovascular examination was a
regular rate and rhythm.  The respiratory examination was
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender and nondistended.  The extremities had palpable
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and no peripheral edema.
The incision was clean, dry and intact.  Physical therapy was
at level 3.

LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  Laboratory data included a
platelet count of 27,000, potassium of 4, BUN of 49 and
creatinine of 1.4.

COMPLICATIONS:
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Docusate 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Regular insulin sliding scale as follows:  for glucose of 150
to 200, three units; for 201 to 250, six units; for 251 to
300, nine units and for 301 to 350, twelve units.
Valium 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Flovent metered dose inhaler 220 mcg two puffs b.i.d.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d. times seven days.
Combivent metered dose inhaler four puffs q.i.d.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o. h.s.
Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d.
Percocet 5 mg one to two tablets p.o. every three to four
hours p.r.n.
Milk of Magnesia 30 mg p.o. h.s. p.r.n.
Acetaminophen 650 mg p.o. every four hours p.r.n.
Levaquin 250 mg p.o. q.o.d. times five days.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Primary:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times three.
2.  Heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

Secondary:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Back surgery in the [**2053**].
4.  Prostate retention.
5.  Bilateral vein stripping.
6.  Renal cyst.
7.  History of pneumonia requiring hospitalization.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient's condition was good and
stable to rehabilitation.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in
three to four weeks.  He is to follow up with his primary
care physician in three to four weeks for general checks.  He
is also to see his primary care physician in three to four
weeks for a medical alert tag in reference to the heparin
induced thrombocytopenia.  Finally, he will follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the urology service as an outpatient for
possible urethral damage secondary to the patient
accidentally pulling the Foley catheter out.
