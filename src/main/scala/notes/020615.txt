History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 11923**] is a very nice 68 YO woman with h/o HTN,
NSCLC metastatic to the brain who initially presented to [**Hospital1 20004**] with altered mental status, a HR of 120 and SBP in the
90s.  She reportedly had altered mental status but she says she
felt fine, did not recognize any confusion and said sometimes

CT Head [**2126-10-21**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No
significant change in bifrontal vasogenic edema since [**10-7**], [**2126**]. Please note, CT is not as sensitive as MRI in the
detection of intracranial lesions or metastasis.
.
ECG [**2126-10-21**]: Sinus tachycardia. Borderline right axis deviation.

Low limb lead QRS voltages. ST-T wave abnormalities. Findings
are nonspecific but clinical correlation is suggested for
possible in
part chronic pulmonary disease and possible ischemia. No
previous tracing available for comparison.
.
CXR [**2126-10-21**]: Large left lung mass. No evidence of pneumonia or
CHF.
.
CTA Chest [**2126-10-21**]: 1. Extensive bilateral acute pulmonary
embolism as described above. No evidence of right heart strain.
2. Redemonstration of left lower lobe lung mass and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. 3. Findings highly concerning for a new T4
metastasis. Stable appearance of T6 compression fracture.
.
Echo [**2126-10-22**]:  Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free
wall hypokinesis with pulmonary artery hypertension probable
main pulmonary artery thrombus c/w pulmonary embolism.
.
CXR [**2126-10-22**]: Since yesterday, mild bibasal atelectasis slightly
increased. Left perihilar mass is unchanged. There is no new
area of consolidation and no pulmonary edema. There is no
pleural effusion. Heart size is normal.
.
CXR [**2126-10-23**]: No significant interval change was demonstrated.
The mild cardiomegaly is present. The bilateral hilar
enlargement might represent pulmonary hypertension due to
massive pulmonary embolism. The known superior segment left
lower lobe large neoplastic mass is demonstrated abating the
left hilus, unchanged.
.
CXR [**2126-10-23**]: In comparison with the study of [**10-23**], the left mid
lung opacification has somewhat decreased. The pulmonary
vascularity is essentially within normal limits, and enlargement
of the cardiac silhouette persists.
.
CXR [**10-24**]: There is slight interval worsening in right upper lobe
opacities which might represent developing pneumonia given its
absence on [**2126-10-22**]. No change in the known left mass
and hilar lymphadenopathy is present. The lung bases are stable.
Small amount of left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
.
CXR [**10-26**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the left lung
mass is
unchanged. The pre-existing right upper lobe opacity is
increasing in
density. Minimal increase in density is also observed in the
right
pericardiac parts of the lung. Otherwise, the radiograph is
unchanged.
.
CXR [**10-30**]: Previous large right upper lobe pneumonia is slightly
improved since [**10-26**]. Large left hilar mass unchanged.
Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion developed between
[**10-22**] and 27, subsequently stable. Interval decrease in
heart size, now normal, could reflect resolving pericardial
effusion.  Mediastinal contour suggests adenopathy, better
delineated by recent chest CT scanning. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 11923**] is a 68 year old with metastatic NSCLC with brain
mets presenting with palpitations and feeling unwell x 2 days,
found to have a saddle PE.
.
# Pulmonary Embolism: Patient found to have PE on CTA in setting
of palpitations, some findings consistent with right ventricular
strain on EKG and physical exam. Echo showed RV cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis with pulmonary artery
hypertension probable main pulmonary artery thrombus c/w
pulmonary embolism.Cardiac enzymes also elevated likely
secondary to RV strain and PE. She was started on IV heparin,
supplemental O2, nebulizers. She continued to have wheezes on
exam and tachypnea at baseline but improved slowly during her
admission. She was kept on telemetry and remained tachycardic at
baseline, however her blood pressure remained stable. PT/OT was
consulted to evaluate for safety and encourage ambulation. Her
O2 sats improved, and she is discharged on room air. Her
tachycardia improved as wel
