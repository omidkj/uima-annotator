Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast in the
body of the LA. No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA. Depressed LAA emptying
velocity (<0.2m/s) All four pulmonary veins identified and enter
the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dilated RA. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness. Mildly
dilated LV cavity. Normal regional LV systolic function. Mildly
depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. Moderate global RV free wall
hypokinesis.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending
aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Focal calcifications in aortic arch.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets. Moderate/severe MVP. Partial
mitral leaflet flail. Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS. Eccentric MR jet.
Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. Mild to
moderate [[**11-23**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient. Bilateral pleural effusions.
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). The right atrium is dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 40-45 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The
mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is bileaflet
prolapse with a flail P2 segment and potentislly some A2 partial
flail. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last
