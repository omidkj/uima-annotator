CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for
cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
and hypercholesterolemia who presented to an outside hospital
with four days of progressive shortness of breath with
worsening shortness of breath on exertion.  The patient
describes chest pain with the shortness of breath (which was
generalized).

Upon presentation to the outside hospital, the patient was
found to be in congestive heart failure with an
electrocardiogram rhythm consistent with an acute ischemic
event/acute coronary syndrome.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for evaluation for catheterization.  At that time, the
patient was administered nitroglycerin, Lasix 80 mg
intravenously, morphine, Plavix, and heparin.

At the catheterization, the patient was found to have a 2+
mitral regurgitation, an ejection fraction of 35% to 40%,
proximal left main coronary artery stenosis of 30% and 80%
distally, left anterior descending artery diffusely
stenotic, and LCM with 70% at the origin, and good targets to
first obtuse marginal and second obtuse marginal.  The right
coronary artery had severe diffuse proximal and medial
disease with total occlusion left greater than right
collateralization.  The final assessment was left main severe
disease and right coronary artery occlusion with moderately
elevated left-sided filling pressures post diuresis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.
3.  Cerebrovascular accident.
4.  Increased cholecystectomy.
5.  Chronic renal failure.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Insulin 95 units subcutaneously q.a.m. and 25 units
subcutaneously q.p.m.
2.  Gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. twice per day.
3.  Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. once per day.
4.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. once per day.
5.  Lovastatin 40 mg p.o. once per day.
6.  Aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  A former smoker; quit one year ago.  He is
married.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  General physical
examination revealed a pleasant male.  Vital signs revealed
temperature was 98, blood pressure was 115/64, heart rate was
95, respiratory rate was 24, and oxygen saturation was 92% on
nonrebreather.  Neck revealed no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  Lungs revealed crackles at the bases.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Positive bowel
sounds.  Extremity examination revealed dopplerable dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibialis pulses.  Rectal examination was
guaiac-positive at the outside hospital.  Neurologic
examination revealed alert and oriented times three.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial
laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 32.1,
hematocrit was 33, and platelets were 271.  Chemistry-7
revealed sodium was 136, potassium was 5.1, chloride was 106,
bicarbonate was 17, blood urea nitrogen was 43, creatinine
was 1.7, and blood glucose was 382.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  X-ray was consistent with
congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**5-1**] to the
Medicine Service.  The patient had a cardiac catheterization
as previously stated in the History of Present Illness.

At that time, Cardiothoracic Surgery was asked to evaluate
the patient.  It was decided that the patient would benefit
from a bypass surgery.

On [**5-1**], the patient was taken to the operating room with
the initial diagnoses of coronary artery disease,
hypertension, increased, cholesterol, insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal insufficiency.

The patient had an emergent coronary artery bypass graft
times two with a left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the
obtuse marginal.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
and was transported to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery
Unit in stable condition.

During the patient's Intensive Care Unit stay, he was
initially weaned off of Milrinone, Neo-Synephrine, and
levofloxacin.  The patient tolerated the weaning well and was
started on Lasix.  Initially, the patient became
thrombocytopenic.  Heparin and all lines were discontinued
along with .....................

On postoperative day four, the patient's platelets improved
to 140 (from 87).  Captopril was started.  The Swan-Ganz
catheter was discontinued.  Overall, the patient was doing
well.

On postoperative day five, the patient was transferred to the
Cardiac floor and continued to do well.  At that time, the
patient had his wires discontinued.  He was started on
quarter-strength antihypoglycemic doses with reference to
preoperative levels.  The patient was also screened for
rehabilitation, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consultation for better blood
sugar control was initiated.

On postoperative day seven, it was decided that the patient
was well enough to be discharged to rehabilitation services.
At that time, the patient's physical therapy level was a II.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Discharge physical
examination revealed temperature was 98.3/97.8, heart rate
was 68, blood pressure was 130/62, respiratory rate was 18,
and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air; 1100 in and 350
plus out.  Preoperative weight was 79 kilograms.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON DISCHARGE:  White blood cell
count was 10, hematocrit was 33, and platelets were 258.
Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 142, potassium was 4.3,
chloride was 107, bicarbonate was 24, blood urea nitrogen was
12, creatinine was 2, and blood glucose was 97.  The
patient's baseline creatinine is between 1.5 and 2.

PRIMARY DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post coronary artery
bypass graft times two.

SECONDARY DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Diabetes mellitus; poorly controlled.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation
facility for general care and cardiac postoperative surgery
care.
2.  The patient should continue with wound checks and
physical therapy.
3.  The patient should continue on a cardiac and diabetic
diet.
