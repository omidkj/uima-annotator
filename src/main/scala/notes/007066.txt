History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90598**] is an 83yo man wiht a PMHx significant for
known aortic stenosis s/p valve replacement on [**2103-9-25**], CAD
s/p CABG x4, significant pulmonary disease including pulmonary
HTN in the setting of restrictive lung dz (pulmonary asbestosis)
as well as obstructive lung dz (on home O2), right cerebellar
CVA, s/p right CEA, HTN, HL and RCC s/p left nephrectomy who was
admitted overnight for altered mental status.
     He was admitted here between [**9-24**] and 11/3 [**1-3**] increasing
SOB in the setting of severe AS.  He had a valve replacement on
[**9-25**] and improved over the next several days.  Upon discharge
to
rehab, he was noted to be at neurological baseline and is
described as being alert and oriented.  However, upon arrival to
rehab ([**Hospital 4470**] Health Care Center Rehab in [**Location (un) 38**]) he was
noted to be very confused and combative with the staff.  He did
not sleep much overnight, but finally settled down by the next
morning ([**10-5**]-- the morning of admission).  Mr. [**Known lastname 90598**]
himself
notes that he wasn't feeling "right".  However, when he awoke,
he
again was noted to be confused, stating that he was in a school
in [**State 108**] filming a movie when asked where he was.  He was
evaluated by [**Name Initial (MD) **] psychiatric RN who recommended that he be
evaluated in an ED for further investigation of these changes.
Apparently was given LZP at the rehab by ED report.  However, he
then began to c/o chest pain and became unresponsive.  He then
went to an OSH ED where an evaluation revealed a negative NCHCT
and a CXR with concern for mild CHF per ED notes.  He as then
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.
     In the ED, he received a NCHCT, which showed no acute
process and a urinalysis which was significant for 75 WBCs and
he
was started on cipro due to concern for a UTI.

and repetition; naming intact, but with some errors (bracelets =
rings). No dysarthria. [**Location (un) **] intact. Registers [**2-1**], but
recalls
[**12-4**] in 5 minutes (but [**1-4**] with prompting). No right-left
confusion. No evidence of neglect.

Cranial Nerves: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3 to
2 mm bilaterally. Unable to visualize fundi [**1-3**] cooperation.
Visual fields are full to confrontation. Extraocular movements
intact bilaterally with some right beating end-gaze nystagmus.
Sensation intact V1-V3. Facial movement symmetric. Hearing
intact
to finger rub bilaterally. Palate elevation symmetric.
Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius full strength bilaterally.
Tongue midline, movements intact.

Radiology [**2103-10-8**]
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Compared to the prior film, there
is reduction in the diffuse bilateral opacities seen on the
prior film. There is also stable widening of the cardiac and
mediastinal silhouettes. Again noted are extensive
asbestos-related pleural plaques. There is no pneumothorax,
hemothorax, or pleural effusion. The sternal cerclage wires are
intact and unchanged. The large wire stent projecting over the
mediastinum is also unchanged in position.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intrathoracic hemorrhage.
2. Interval improvement in pulmonary edema.
3. Stable asbestos-related pleural plaques.
4. Stable postoperative changes to the mediastinal structures.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


[**2103-10-5**]: Head CT
No acute intracranial hemorrhage, large vascular territory
infarct, shift of midline structures or mass effect is present.
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent consistent with
age-related atrophy. There is mild periventricular and
subcortical white matter hypoattenuation consistent with
sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease. The visible paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells show a mucus-retention cyst in the
right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial process.


Brief Hospital Course:
