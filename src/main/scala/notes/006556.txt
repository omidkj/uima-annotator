Brief Hospital Course:
37yo M with hx of opiate abuse, with +opiate tox screen, on
methadone and hx of asthma with intubations s/p mechanical fall
with no obvious injuries with an asthma exacerbation requiring
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in the ED.
.
#Asthma Exacerbation. Patient with hx of asthma with intubations
in past though unclear when. Was agitated in the ED given Haldol
and Ativan and in this context had an asthma exacerbation.
Patient placed on noninvasive treatment with improvement of co2.
Upon transfer patient was on NC and respiratory status was
stable. Patient does have 6 Eos in  his differential of CBC.
Given his current respiratory status, no positive pressure
needed in MICU. Patient was treated with q4 hr combivent
nebulized treatment, prednisone burst and advair. He was
observed in the MICU with continued stable respiratory status.
At the time of attempted transfer to the floor, the patient
insisted to leave against medical advice. Peak flow at that time
was 475 (best of three trials) of a predicted ~600 based on
age/height. He was discharged against medical advice with
prescription to complete a 5-day prednisone burst.
.
#Fall. Patient is s/p mechanical fall. Patient states he was
walking and turned head to look at train and fell. No apparent
injuries, denies pain. Had negative head CT/neck CT/chest xray
per wet reads. Final reads showed no obvious fracture on CT
head/C-spine and he had no significant pain. The trauma service
performed a tertiary survey with no new findings.
.
#Heroin use/on methadone. Patient with hx of heroin abuse, admit
to recent use and + opiates in urine as well as +methadone. We
monitored for signs of withdrawl and restarted his methadone. We
also contact[**Name (NI) **] his methadone clinic to confirm doses of 85mg PO
daily and contact[**Name (NI) **] SW; however, he left AMA before he could be
evaluated by the SW team. Methadone was held overnight but
restarted on hospital day #1.
.
#Agitation in ED. Patient threatened staff in ED for trying to
undress him. Given Haldol 10mg and Ativan 6mg. Currently denying
SI/HI. Patient was assessed as the sedating medication wore off
and upon reevaluation was calm though demanding to leave the
hospital.
.
