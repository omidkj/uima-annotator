Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotrachial intubation
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 17204**] is a 55-year-old man with CAD s/p CABG,
hypertension, COPD on 2L of home oxygen and multiple recent
hospital admissions who presented one day prior to admission
with worsening shortness of breath. He is now transferred to the
ICU for worsening hypercarbia and initiation of BiPAP.

Notably, the patient has had 4 admissions in the past 2 weeks
for similar symptoms and he has been treated for COPD
exacerbations. He reports that on discharge from the hospital
about four days ago, he was feeling well. At 1 am on the morning
of admission he experienced an episode of shortness of breath
while watching TV. He turned his oxygen up, used his nebulizers
and inhalers and had no relief. He waited until the morning
hours and then went to the ED. He reports using all medications
as prescribed and using oxygen regularly. He smokes 1 ppd but
states he is quitting today.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.8, 102, 152/111, 20, 96% on 2L.
Patient was given nebs, prednisone 30 mg (total dose on day of
admission 60 mg), and azithromycin. He was given morphine 4 mg
IV for pain and Toradol. Labs showed leukocytosis of 14.4 and
otherwise unremarkable. BNP was 1163 and troponin was negative.
ECG showed sinus tach without ST changes. On the floor, patient
was continued on prednisone 60 mg and azithromycin. On day of
transfer to the ICU, patient was noted to become increasingly
confused and an ABG was performed that showed respiratory
acidosis with 7.19/93/96 (no previous for comparison during this
admission). It is noteworthy that the patient had received 0.5
mg Ativan x2 and morphine earlier in the afternoon, and there is
concern that this may have contributed to his altered mental
status. He is transferred to the ICU for worsening respiratory
acidosis. Vital signs at time of transfer are O2 sat mid 90s on
3L oxygen, HR 70, BP 127/57, RR 26.

Notably, on the day of transfer his metoprolol was stopped and
changed from amlodipine. Otherwise most of his home medications
have been continued.

ROS: currently, patient endorses shortness of breath and chest
tightness. Review of systems is otherwise limited as patient is
currently on Bipap for ventilation.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. COPD with severe exacerbation:  At presentation patient was
treated with prednisone 60mg On [**2152-11-16**] he became acutely
confused, took off his oxygen, with desats to 60s on room air;
ABG showed 7.19/93/96.  Soon afterwards he was transferred to
the ICU for NIV with subsequent endotrachial intubation and
mechanical ventilation.

After tranfer and intubation he was covered with vancomycin and
levofloxacin for possible hospital-aquired respiratory infection
with increase in steroids to 60mg IV solumedrol. Sputum
subsequently grew MRSA and Serratia Marsecens.  After three days
on mechanical ventilation he was extubated and soon thereafter
discharged to the medical floor. He completed his course of
Vancomycin/Levofloxacin with no further respiratory issues and
tolerated a Prednisone taper.

2. Coronary artery disease and hypertension: Continued home
regimen of [**Date Range 42297**], aspirin.  Held lisinopril and
amlodipine initially given hypotension surrounding intubation.
Restarted Amlodipine and Lisinopril in the ICU, and then
metoprolol and furosemide on the medical floor, which the
patient tolerated well.

3. Lower extremity edema: Mild LE edema starting on [**11-27**], R>L.
No pulmonary edema. Patient had mild response to PO lasix at
increased dosing (40mg daily) with stable Cr. Thought to be
secondary to steroids; bilateral lower extremity dopplers
negative for DVT on the day of discharge. If lower extremity
edema persists after cessation of steroids would also consider
possible contribution of Amlodipine and consider a trial
discontinuation. Electrolytes to be checked by VNA on [**2152-12-1**]
with results faxed to Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].

4. Anemia: Hct decreased from 39 on admission to 26-27, but
remained stable at that level. Iron studies consistant with iron
deficiencies. Stools were guaiac negative.  Placed on ferrous
sulfate supplementation. Defer further work-up to the outpatient
setting.

5. Chronic Back Pain: Continued 5/325mg Percocets 1-2 Tabs q6hr
prn pain and encouraged patient to discuss pain regimen with his
PCP.

6. Goals of care:  Given frequent admission related to symptoms
control, palliative care was consulted and confirmed DNR but OK
to intubate. He also prefers to be at home with his
sister-in-law and HCP, [**Name (NI) **].

7. Medication compliance: Extended conversations with the
patient and his sister-in-law brought to light that the patient
has not been taking his medications as prescribed between
admissions. He confirmed this, during a family meeting on [**11-28**],
and is now agreeable to having his sister-in-law administer his
medications. VNA will be arranged to assist with medication
reconciliation.  Based on a review of his medications at home,
with his sister-in-law [**Name (NI) **], many of his cardiac medications
have not been filled since [**2151-12-3**]. He is aware of the
importance of medication compliance in reducing readmissions. An
adequate supply will be provided to the patient, to reach his
planned appointment with his PCP.
