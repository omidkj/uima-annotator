History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61yo M with a PMH of biphenotypic leukemia on
outpatient treatment with Ambisome and voriconazole for
disseminated fusarium [**Month/Day/Year 2**] and recent admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
on [**7-27**] for fever and abdominal pain, now being admitted for a
new lesion on congenital oral mass concerning for persistent and
worsening fungal [**Month/Day (4) 2**]. Patient had been going to outpatient
clinic daily for IV infusion of Ambisome. Today patient noted a
sore on the congenital mass on the roof of his mouth that has
been persistent for the past 4-5days. Lesion on roof of mouth,
under dentures, [**2156-1-22**] pain improved without dentures in place.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Biphenotypic Leukemia - Initially prsented with "autoimmune
pancytopenia" treated with steroids and IVIG. In [**3-/2157**] his
cytopenias worsened and he was noted to have about 90% blasts
and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Preliminary bone marrow biopsy

was suspicious for a biphenotypic leukemia and therapy was
initiated with hyperCVAD. His day 14 marrow showed persistent
disease and his regimen was changed to 7+3. Day 14 and two
subsequent marrows all continued to show persistent involvement

with leukemia. Further chemotherapy was held as he was found to

have disseminated fusarium [**Hospital1 2**] in the setting of prolonged

neutropenia. He was ultimately discharged on G-CSF and daily
Ambisome infusions. He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2157-7-27**] for
neutropenic fever and abdominal pain of unknown etiology. While
hospitalized he was treated with a 10-day course of decitabine
without complications.

[**8-26**] [**Month/Day (4) **] culture X2 negative
[**8-30**] [**Month/Year (2) **] culture X2 negative

Imaging:
[**2157-8-21**] MRI soft tissue head: No evidence of enhancing soft
tissues or fluid collection identified in the neck. There is
minimal soft-tissue thickening in the partially visualized
maxillary sinuses. The patient previously had maxillary sinus
disease on prior sinus CT. if further evaluation of sinuses is
clinically indicated, consider a repeat sinus CT.
[**2157-8-30**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. There
is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with
impaired fillling/tamponade physiology. Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 20342**] was
notified by telephone on [**2157-8-30**] at 4:35 pm.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-8-1**],
the pericardial effusion is now larger and there is now right
ventricular diastolic collapse. Left ventricular systolic
function appears slightly more vigorous.
[**2157-9-2**] Echo: Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %) with inferior hypokinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears circumferential. No right ventricular diastolic collapse
is seen. There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse
suggestive of elevated intrapericardial pressure without overt
tamponade. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2157-8-30**], no change.
[**2157-9-4**] RUQ US: 1. No biliary obstruction or other explanation
for abnormal LFTs.  2. Trace perihepatic ascites. 3. Right
pleural effusion.
4. Moderate pericardial effusion.
[**2157-9-4**] CXR: AP chest compared to [**6-27**] through [**7-30**]:
Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which
enlarged
between [**6-13**] and [**7-27**] is unchanged subsequently.
Mediastinal and
pulmonary vascular engorgement are essentially unchanged since
[**Month (only) **], and edema is minimal, if any, difficult to
distinguish from relatively symmetric infrahilar opacification
which could also be due to mild-to-moderate atelectasis. There
is no pulmonary edema or consolidation in the upper lungs.
[**2157-9-9**] Echo: Normal LV size with low-normal systolic function.
