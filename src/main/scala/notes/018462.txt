Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25288**] was admitted one day prior to surgery secondary to
being on Coumadin and he required a pre-op Echo. On [**11-25**] he was

artery bypass graft x 5. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on op
day he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and
extubated. On post-op day one he was started on beta blockers
and diuretics and gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight.
Later on this day he was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further care. On post-op day two his chest tubes were removed.
On post-op day three his epicardial pacing wires were removed.
He had atrial fibrillation for which he was started on
amiodarone. He was converted to sinus rhythm. He was restarted
on coumadin for history of CVA. He was ready for discharge to
rehab on POD #4.
