IV tPA


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Russian speaking unknown handedness
woman with past medical history of TIA [**7-3**] with slurring of
speech, atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation,
hypertension,
severe AS, glaucoma and cataracts with legal blindness who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2117-10-1**] at 11:55 am as a "Code Stroke".

Per information from her family and her home health aide,
patient
was well this morning. Her daughter, who lives next door, was
visiting. Patient ate normally and spent all morning playing
with
her great grandson [**Name (NI) 12130**]. [**Name2 (NI) **] daughter left around 10:15 am.
Around 11 or 11:15am, her home health aide [**Doctor First Name 38329**] arrived. Family

and I spoke to [**Doctor First Name 38329**] via telephone. Per [**Doctor First Name 38329**], patient was able

to open door to let [**Doctor First Name 38329**] in and was walking around the house
normally (in her usual fashion, which is holding onto the walls

because she is legally blind and refuses to use a walker). [**Doctor First Name 38329**]

and patient had conversation. Patient complained about the
weather, but did not endorse any neurologic complaints. Per
[**Doctor First Name 38329**], patient's speech was normal. Then, around 11:30 am, they

went into bathroom to get patient ready for bath. While in
bathroom, patient started to have slurring of speech, was
diaphoretic, and had left facial droop and difficulty using her

left side. [**Doctor First Name 38329**] called the patient's son [**Name (NI) 2491**] who then called

EMS.
She arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] ED at 11:55am. Code Stroke called at
11:57am. Neurology Resident on scene at 12:08pm; stroke fellow
had arrived several minutes earlier.
NIH stroke scale was performed and graded as follows:
1a LOC: Alert=0
1b LOC questions: Said name=1
1c Commands: Able to follow commands=0
2 Gaze: Fixed to right. Could not overcome with OCR=2
3 Vision: Blind per family. No consistent blink to threat=3
4. Facial: Left UMN palsy=2
[**6-4**]. Motor: Holds right arm and leg off bed with no drift. Left

arm and leg are plegic with no withdrawal to pain=3+0+3+0
7. Limb ataxia: Proportional to weakness=0
8. Sensory: Severe sensory loss on left arm/leg/face=2
9. Language: Limited by language barrier, but some
perseveration,
stuttering=1
10. Dysarthria: Speech slurred by family=1.
11. Neglect: Left hemineglect profound=2
Scored at 21. Noncontrast head CT showed no evidence of
hemorrhage. Discussed with Stroke Fellow, Attg Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and
patient's family members. Risks/benefits of thrombolysis
reviewed. Contraindications reviewed with family and patient had

no absolute contraindications by history. Decision made to
proceed with thrombolysis with bolus 4.9 mg and infusion of
44.2mg. Bolus started at 1:30pm. While bolus was being infused,

patient noted to move left arm and to have resolution of her
right eye deviation. Post tPA bolus, BP elevated to 190s
systolic, so at 1:50pm, 5 mg IV Labetalol given per stroke
fellow. 10 mg IV Labetalol given at 2:15pm after BP goals
changed
to systolic of 140-160 after recanulization.
Per family, no recent fevers, chills, chest pain, palpitations,

nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.

.
[**2117-10-1**] CT head - 1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.  2. Likely
subacute-to-chronic infarcts in the left parietal and right
frontoparietal distributions. It is difficult to exclude early
acute stroke given these findings, and if clinical suspicion
remains high, MRI is recommended.
.
ECG - Atrial flutter with 2:1 response.  Left anterior
fascicular block
Probable left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave
abnormalities
The ST-T wave changes are nonspecific - clinical correlation is
suggested
.
CXR - Evidence of failure. No evidence for pneumonia.
.
[**2117-10-2**] CT head - 1. Stable appearance of right middle cerebral
artery area infarction. No evidence of interval intracranial
hemorrhage.
2. Stable appearance of left posterior parietal infarction.
.
Carotid US - report pending at time of d/c

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred to the ICU on cardiac telemetry
after administration of tPA.  She ruled out for an acute
myocardial infarction with three sets of negative cardiac
enzymes.  She had almost a total recovery from her symptoms
after 1 day in the ICU.  Her blood pressure was maintained in
the 140-1
