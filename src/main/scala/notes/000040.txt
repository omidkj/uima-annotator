HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 55-year-old man
with multiple medical problems including insulin dependent
diabetes secondary to severe pancreatitis in [**2123**], remote
history of Hodgkin's disease in [**2113**] treated with among other
things, radiation therapy which has left the patient with
severe osteoporosis and resulting compression fractures,
history of alcohol abuse, on chronic opioids for residual
pain secondary to pancreatitis, who presented on [**12-26**] with
delta MS.

Per the patient's lifetime partner, the patient self
increased his dose of opiate using approximately four patches
of Fentanyl and increasing his Seroquel dose from 150 to 300
mg.  He presented to the ED on [**2135-12-26**] with increased
weakness, tremor, disorientation x2 months, worse over the
prior three days.

In the ED, the patient's temperature was 98.4, blood pressure
was 136-145/60-70.  His heart rate was 71-130.  He was
treated with Ativan 7 mg for what they thought was alcohol
withdrawal, which increased the patient's sedation and
subsequently his systolic blood pressure decreased to 88-97.
Patient had a negative head CT.  A lumbar puncture was
attempted, but was not successful.  Patient was started on
acyclovir, Vancomycin for empiric meningitis coverage.  The
patient's Chem-7 at that time was significant for a glucose
of 354, an anion gap of 13, 15 ketones in his urine.  With
these results, the ED started the patient on an insulin drip.

His blood gas initially was 7.23/55/46, but then decreased to
7.16/56/260.  The patient was minimally alert at this time.
He had progressive somnolence.  Patient was then started on
BiPAP 10 of 5, and was admitted to the MICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD.
2. Diabetes mellitus insulin dependent secondary to chronic
pancreatitis.
3. Chronic alcohol induced pancreatitis status post
debridement.
4. History of alcohol abuse.
5. Osteoporosis.
6. CHF with an ejection fraction of 40%.
7. Hodgkin's disease status post XRT, chemotherapy,
splenectomy.
8. Hypothyroidism.
9. GERD.
10. Vocal cord paralysis.
11. Chronic pain on multiple narcotics.
12. Anxiety and depression.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient has a 40 pack year history of
tobacco.  No recent ethanol use.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 98.5, blood pressure 104/64,
heart rate 107.  Cardiovascular:  Patient has a 3/6 systolic
murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border and at the
apex.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, multiple
surgical scars.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or
edema.  Pulses are [**12-30**]+ bilaterally.  Neurologic:  The
patient responds to commands, is moving all four extremities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the MICU for
further management.  On [**2135-12-27**], he was intubated due to
increased somnolence and hypoxia.

On [**2135-12-28**], an EEG was performed, which was read as
possibly consistent with encephalitis.  Patient was then seen
by the Neuro team, who recommended a MRI and LP.

On [**2135-12-28**], the patient's temperature spiked to 101.6.  He
was continued on ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir for
possible meningitis.  He was also started on a bicarb drip
for metabolic acidosis.  The patient was initially treated
with Ativan for narcotic withdrawal, but then this was D/C'd
and he was later started on a lower dose of Fentanyl.

On [**2135-12-29**], the patient was transferred to the VICU.
Analysis of the CSF fluid revealed 2 monocytes, 15
lymphocytes, 1 band.  Gram stain was negative for PMNs,
macrophages, or bacteria.  Culture was negative.  PCR for
Listeria and HSV were negative.

Results from the patient's MRI on [**2135-12-28**] revealed normal
brain parenchyma.  No blood breakdown or edema present.
Overall impression was that the MRI was grossly normal,
however, the study was limited by patient motion.

In the MICU, the patient was extubated.  His mental status
continued to improve.  He was continued on antibiotics for
treatment of presumed community acquired pneumonia.  He was
noted to have eosinophilia, which improved over the course of
his hospitalization.  He was transfused with 1 unit of blood
and transiently went into pulmonary edema in the setting of
this transfusion.  This resolved with Lasix and nebulizers.
Acyclovir was D/C'd as the patient's MRI and lumbar puncture
were negative.

The patient was then transferred to the medical floor, where
he was alert and oriented, able to ambulate with cane, and
was tolerating good p.o. intake.  He was seen by Physical
Therapy, who felt that he would benefit from a rehabilitation
stay.
