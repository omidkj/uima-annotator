Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:

1. Acute renal Failure: Most likely [**3-13**] hypoperfusion during
episode of bradycardia and hypotension vs. dye nephropathy. Pt
may have been dehydrated on admission and then received dye
without rehydration due to urgency to r/o PE.
- Pt had hyaline casts on urine sediment exam suggestive of ATN.

- Pt began to experience worsening renal function with peak
creat of 4.8 from baseline of 0.8 with oliguria. Pt transfered
to ICU on [**10-5**] with acute renal fialure, altered mental status
and hypotension.
- Pt was found to have a metabolic acidosis and was unable to
compensate with hx of asthma. Transfered to ICU for possible
intubation, but pt did well on Bipap and intubation not
necessary. Treated with aggressive fluid resussitation. BUN/Cr
began to improve and resp status also improved. Pt able to come
off of Bipap and returned to baseline function.
- Central line placed for fluid and CVP. CVP found to be
elevated, but ECHO showed 4+ tricuspid regurg.
- Pt then developed a post-ATN diuresis and was making approx 4
liters of urine outpt over 24 hours. This tapered off by
discharge and after foley removed.
- Metabolic acidosis resolved. D/c'd ACE with ARF, restarted
when pt back to baseline.
- Hyponatremia resolved with resolution of RF.

2. GUIAC + stools: slightly +, may be [**3-13**] iron supplementation
however pt had large coagulopathy with hematuria and ozzing at
line sites. This was reversed and all has resolved. NG lavage
neg. Occurred only with coagulopathy. GUIAC neg on d/c.
- Scheduled appointment for outpt followup with [**Hospital **] clinic.

3. Altered mental status in setting of hypotension and
hypoglycemia. Pt and family report that pt will have these
episodes at home and they treat with OJ. Appears resolved with
stabilization. Adjusted NPH and ISS to avoid hypoglycemic
episodes.

4. Afib - Appears to have paraxosymal afib. Will not cardiovert
d/t unknown time course.
- Pt started on wgt based Heparin for ? paroxsysmal Afib.
Developed PTT of >150 and heparin stopped. Based on risk of <1%
for stroke with Afib and pt's reaction to heparin with only one
episode of Afib observed throughout admission, no further
anticoag.

5. Bradycardia - Likely secondary to multiple cardiac meds in
combination with renal failure (ACE I, CCB, clonidine. Pt back
to baseline at d/c. RBB on ECG, cardiac enzymes neg.

6. Respiratory - Hx of asthma with wheezing on exam. Breathing
much improved from admission, back to baseline.
- Cont NC O2 at 2L at home.
- Alb/atro nebs Q4 PRN
- Bipap at night
- Predinisone 40 QD. Tapered over admission, d/c's before
discharge.

7. DM - ISS. Low sugars over first day d/t slow insulin
clearance by kidney. Will hold home NPH. Pt states that this
ofetn happens at home as well.
- Changed NPH to 20u Qam and 20u Qpm and covering with humalog
for meals and bedtime. No recorded episodes of hypoglycemia
after change. BS slightly elevated during day.
- Scheduled f/u apt at [**Company 191**] for [**10-17**]. Asked pt to record all home
FSBS and nring to apt.

8. HTN: pt initially with hypotension and all antihypertensives
held. Restarted on Verapimil at half home dose. Restarted home
BP meds prior to D/c. Held beta-blocker due to hx of asthma and
low baseline HR.

9. FEN - Tolerated Diabetic well.

10. Lines - L subclavian d/c'd [**10-12**],  L PIV.
11. Proph - SQ heparin, PPI, pneumoboots
