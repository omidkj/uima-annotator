Service:  CCU

IDENTIFICATION/CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is an 83-year-old
female who was admitted from [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital with
chest pain and an episode of ventricular tachycardia
prompting syncope.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was well until three
weeks ago when she fell and injured her back.  She presented
to an outside hospital on [**9-19**] when she woke up
suddenly at 1 a.m. with dyspnea and diaphoresis.  She
attempted to get up and walk around but that did not relieve
the situation.  She was taken by ambulance to
[**Hospital 26200**] Hospital where she received aspirin and
nitroglycerin.

At [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital the patient had a syncopal
episode and 90 seconds of ventricular tachycardia during
which she was unresponsive but had a pulse.  The patient
spontaneously converted to sinus and awoke rapidly.  She was
treated with intravenous nitroglycerin, and heparin, and a
lidocaine drip.  A chest x-ray at that time showed her to be
in mild congestive heart failure, and she was treated with
40 mg of intravenous Lasix.

She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] where she received a dose of intravenous metoprolol,
and an electrocardiogram done at the [**Hospital1 190**] demonstrated resolution of ST depressions in
leads V2 to V5.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Asthma.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Paxil, trazodone, OxyContin,
Colace, multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 620**] with her
daughter and grandchildren.  She has no history of tobacco or
significant alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her brother had a myocardial infarction in
his 40s, and another brother had a myocardial infarction in
his 50s times two.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  On physical examination,
the patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 99.1, blood
pressure 120/72, heart rate of 65, respiratory rate of 20,
and blood pressure 97/46.  She was in no apparent distress.
On cardiovascular examination did not demonstrate jugular
venous distention.  She had a regular rate and rhythm with no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  She was clear to auscultation
bilaterally with scattered wheezes.  She was noted to have a
benign abdominal examination and had trace bilateral ankle
edema.  She had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  From [**Hospital 26200**]
Hospital, the patient's Chem-7 was unremarkable with a
potassium of 3.6 and a BUN and creatinine of 15 and 0.8.  Her
coagulation parameters were within normal limits.  She had a
creatine kinase of 74 and a troponin of 2.9.  Complete blood
count showed a hematocrit of 39.6, white blood cell
count 9.8, and platelets of 222.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Chest x-ray revealed the patient
demonstrated upper lung zone redistribution and perihilar
fullness consistent with congestive heart failure.

Her electrocardiograms showed her to have ST depressions of
3 mm in leads V2 to V5, from the electrocardiogram from the
outside hospital.  Her electrocardiogram findings resolved on
an electrocardiogram done at the [**Hospital1 190**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the hospital
and was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory of
[**2146-9-19**].  On cardiac catheterization the patient
was noted to have an left ventricular end-diastolic pressure
of 33, and a left ventriculography showing 2+ mitral
regurgitation, an ejection fraction of approximately 50% with
some posterobasal hypokinesis.  Her coronary angiography
showed her to have an left anterior descending artery and
left circumflex arising from two separate ostia.  She had
moderate diffuse disease of her left anterior descending
artery with heavy calcification.  Her left circumflex
demonstrated an 80% proximal lesion and diffuse disease in
her first obtuse marginal of 70%.  She demonstrated a
co-dominant system, and her right coronary artery showed a
60% ostial lesion.

The patient underwent an angioplasty and stent placement of
her left circumflex lesion.  There was a 10% residual noted
afterwards.

The patient was transferred to the floor where she became
short of breath and hypertensive and tachycardic.  At that
time she was thought to be in congestive heart failure and
was treated with Lasix and intravenous nitroglycerin.  Due to
her poor respiratory status the patient was intubated and
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.

In the Coronary Care Unit, the patient was diuresed
aggressively overnight and was weaned from the ventilator and
extubated the following morning.  The patient was
subsequently transferred to the floor after a diuresis of
approximately 2.5 liters to 3 liters.

On the floor, the patient continued with diuresis with Lasix
and had her beta blocker and ACE inhibitor increased as
tolerated.  She continued to do well on the floor and
continued to diurese well.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  On [**2146-9-22**], the patient
was in stable condition and was ready for transfer to a
cardiac rehabilitation center for further care.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
 2.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 3.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. times 30 days.
 4.  Paxil 10 mg p.o. q.d.
 5.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
 6.  Multivitamin 1 tablet p.o. q.d.
 7.  Trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.d.
 8.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
 9.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
10.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
11.  Subcutaneous heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d.
12.  Albuterol puffer 2 puffs q.2-4h. p.r.n.
13.  Azmacort p.r.n.
14.  Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL q.5min. times three
p.r.n.
