HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 43 year old woman with
a history of hypertension, schizo-affective disorder, asthma,
and possible emphysema who presents to the Emergency Room
with a three week history of progressive shortness of breath
and dyspnea on exertion.  The day of admission, the patient
complained of acutely worsening shortness of breath and she
was unable to speak in complete sentences at home and

sentences.  The patient was given 5 unit doses of 2.5 mg
Albuterol nebulizers in series with 2 doses of 0.5 mg of
Atrovent.  Her respiratory rate dropped from 34 to 28 with
this treatment and the patient demonstrated improved air
movement by examination.  The patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for monitoring and contiunous
nebulizers on the night of admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, heart rate 98.0 F.;
blood pressure 119/70; respiratory rate 30 q. minute; oxygen
saturation not available.  In general, the patient was
somnolent but arousable with a prolonged expiratory phase of
respiration.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oxygen mask
in place.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  S1, S2
normal.  Pulmonary:  Diffuse expiratory wheezes.  Abdomen
soft, nontender.  Extremities with one plus bilateral lower
extremity edema up to the mid-shin.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white count 6.5, hematocrit 33.7,
platelets 202, with a differential of 59% neutrophils, 22%
lymphocytes, 6% basophils, 16% monocytes.  Sodium 133,
potassium 3.9, chloride 96, bicarbonate 29, BUN 9, creatinine
0.6, glucose 82.

Chest x-ray was clear.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted directly to the
Intensive Care Unit for continuous Albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizer treatments and observation.  Hospital course by
organ systems:
1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient denied any chest pain on
admission, however, was noted to have T wave inversions in V1
through V4 on her admission EKG.  She did not have an old EKG
here available for comparison.  The patient was therefore
ruled out for myocardial infarction as a cause of her
shortness of breath.  On the night of admission, the patient
ruled out by serial enzymes.

For her hypertension, the patient was continued on her
Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q. day.  The patient was not given Inderal
as an in-patient, however, this will be continued upon
discharge.  Her blood pressure was under good control
throughout her hospital stay.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit for around-the-clock Albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizer therapy and observation.  The patient was
also started on intravenous Solu-Medrol.  The patient's
breathing gradually improved and the patient was able to go
to the Regular Medical Floor the day after admission.  She
was then switched to p.o. Prednisone 60 mg p.o. q. day and
started on a Prednisone taper.  The patient was continued on
around-the-clock nebulizers until [**2-12**], and at that time
was switched over to Metered-Dose Inhalers.

On Friday, [**2-12**], the patient began ambulating and was
able to do so without becoming excessively dyspneic.  In
order to improve compliance with her Metered-Dose Inhalers,
we changed her regimen to Flovent two puffs twice a day,
Serevent two puffs twice a day and Combivent two puffs four
times a day p.r.n.  The patient also is a smoker.  She did
not smoke throughout her hospital stay and was maintained on
a nicotine patch.  The patient requested to have a
prescription for nicotine patch as an outpatient and this was
provided to her.  Of note, the patient's peak flows were
followed, however, the patient is unable to use the
spirometer correctly and it was felt that her peak flows were
not accurate in measuring her progress.

3.  Infectious Disease:  The patient reported a three week
history of cough productive of yellow sputum.  The patient
had no fever or chills but in general felt under the weather
from this cough.  A sputum was sent which showed four plus
Gram negative rods, as well as one plus Gram positive cocci
in pairs and clusters.  The final culture revealed
Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase positive, Oxicillin
sensitive, beta Streptococcus and Hemophilus influenzae.  The
patient was treated with a seven day course of Levaquin.  Her
cough gradually improved and was no longer productive of
purulent sputum.  By the time she was discharged home, repeat
chest x-ray was again clear.

4.  Neuro/Psych:  The patient has a history of
schizo-affective disorder.  She was without acute symptoms on
admission and denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation, and
also denied hearing any voices in her head or having any
visual or auditory hallucinations.  She stated that she was
happy with her current psychiatric care and felt there were
no issues which required in-house assessment by the
Psychiatry Service here.  She was continued on her Prolixin,
Zyprexa, Depakote, Neurontin and Cogentin.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was put on Protonix while
on her steroids.  She will be instructed to continue to take
her usual Prevacid at home while taking steroids.

6.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:   The patient was
euvolemic upon transfer to the floor.  Her electrolytes were
within normal limits.  She was maintained on a regular diet.
