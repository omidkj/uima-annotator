Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo woman with severe COPD presents with dyspnea from nursing
home.  Hospital course by problem:
.
# Respiratory distress - This was thought likely secondary to
pneumonia +/- COPD exacerbation. Patient with history of ESBL
and MRSA so she was initially covered with meropenem and vanco.
Her sputum grew out 3+ gram positive rods, 2+ gram positive
cocci, and 1+ gram negative rods (with good sample).  Further
identification pending upon discharge.  We also monitored her in
the ICU and treated her with a BiPAP.  She was treated with
standing nebs, chest PT, singulair, advair and [**Doctor First Name 130**].  Her
respiratory status significantly improved with these measures.
We also treated with steroids for a COPD exacerbation (initially
with IV solumedrol on [**1-8**] with transition to prednisone 60mg PO
daily by [**1-9**]). She will need to complete a 10 day course of
vancomycin starting on [**1-6**]. Her troughs were therapeutic.
.
# UTI - Patient with gram negative rods in urine culture from
[**1-6**].  Sensitivites indicate that she has largely resistent
klebsiella which is sensitive to meropenem.  We started this on
[**1-6**] and suggest treating for a 10 day course.
.
# Altered mental status: On evening of [**1-8**], the patient
developed altered mental status and garbled speech.  This came
on suddenly and improved within 15 minutes.  A neuro exam at the
time indicated a right facial droop (which has been previously
documented).  She also was alert and oriented to person, place,
date, month, time, and situation (10 min after the change in
mental status was first appreciated).  An ABG at the time showed
good oxygenation and no evidence of hypercarbia.  Blood glucose
was 400.  A head CT preliminarily read as no hemorrhage or
territorial lesion.  Her ms improved.
.
# Anemia - below baseline but stable at 22.  We transfused her
one unit of pRBC prior to discharge.
.
# ARF - labs were initially c/w dehydration.  500cc boluses were
given for hypotension and poor urine output.  This resulted in
improvement in her UOP and stabilization of her blood pressure.
.
# MAT - EKG appears regular.  We were cautious with the
verapamil initially given her hypotension but added it back on.
Her HR was well controlled in the 100-110 range. She was placed
on her home verapamil and had good control of her heart rates.
.
# Steroid Induced DM - Continued a RISS but also added glargine
6u qhs.  This may be titrated in the future as needed.
.
# HTN - continued verapamil as above.
.
# Diastolic CHF - continued HR and BP control
.
# Hilar Mass - work up once stable as outpt
.
# Decubitus and stasis ulcer - wound care per routine
.
# h/o post herpetic neuralgia - we held her neurontin while
decreased MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  This was then restarted prior to
dispo.

# PPx - hep SC, PPI, bowel reg

# FEN - Tube feeds
