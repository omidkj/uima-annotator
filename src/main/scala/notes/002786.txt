HISTORY: 60-year-old male with emphysema/restrictive lung
disease with
leukocytosis and fever.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2194-1-16**].

FINDINGS: The nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach;
the distal tip is directed cephalad. The lungs are clear.
Relative mediastinal prominence may be due to low lung volumes
and magnification on frontal view. No airspace consolidation is
identified to suggest pneumonia. Interstitial prominence is
similar to [**2194-1-14**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Endoscopy
-Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
-Stomach:
Contents: Bilious fluid was seen in the stomach body. There was
no red blood or melena in the stomach or duodenum.
Mucosa: Scattered erosions with erythema and congestion of the
mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the antrum, stomach body
and fundus. These findings are compatible with erosive
gastritis.
Excavated Lesions Two cratered non-bleeding ulcers ranging in
size from 4mm to 10mm were found in the antrum. In addition,
there was an area of nodular mucosa with erythema and congestion
adjacent to the 1 cm ulcer that is likely due to inflammation.
-Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
-Impression: Erosion, erythema and congestion in the antrum,
stomach body and fundus compatible with erosive gastritis
Ulcers in the antrum
Retained fluids in stomach
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum




Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
The patient was admitted with melena, NG lavage positive for
coffee ground emesis, hypotension to 80s, and hematocrit drip
from 40s to 20s. He was transfused 3 units with improvement in
hematocrit to 28.5 and started on IV PPI. He underwent upper
endoscopy, which showed 2 non-bleeding ulcers in the gastric
antrum and gastritis. His blood pressure remained stable and
patient was transferred to the floor to continue with
transfusion of one more unit PRBCs for goal hematocrit of > 30.
The patient was also noted to have leukocytosis of 12.5. Blood
cultures were sent and were pending at the time of transfer. He
was also complaining of new right-sided chest discomfort, but
EKGs were stable and cardiac enzymes were negative.

Floor course:
On arrival to the floor pt was starting his 4th unit of red
blood cells. His blood pressures remained stable initially,then
increased and before discharge was restarted on his blood
pressure medications. His hematocrit was monitored, and was 29.9
after the transfusion. He was started on clears, but complained
of some abdominal discomfort. He was monitored for bleeding for
an additiona
