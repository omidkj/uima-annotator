Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
abd pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
n/a

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 84 y/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4746**] w/ a PMH of severe MR, HTN, and a recent
diagnosis of cryptogenic PNA who was transferred to the ICU in
the setting of abdominal pain and elevated lactate/wbc.  He was
originally admitted following a lung bx (diagnosing COP) when he
presented with dyspnea and hemoptysis.  He was managed on the
floor for these complaints with supplemental oxygen and steroid
therapy.  In the setting of this therapy, the patient became
tachypneic and tachycardic.  His CXR showed worsening
infiltrates and he was started on empiric antibiotics
(levo/flagyl/vanco).  On this regimen he remained tachycardic
and mildly hypotensive but his fever curve trended down and his
CXR improved.
On the AM of consult, the patient noted [**8-31**] diffuse abdominal
pain most intense in the epigastric area.  He denied any
diarrhea (had been constipated x3d) but did endorse nausea w/out
emesis.  He received laxatives w/ temporary relief of his pain
but it recurred later in the day and into the night.  He
described the pain as occuring constant throughout the day but
denies radiation of the pain into the back or groin.  He denies
any dysuria currently and denies any change in the pain with
eating, passing gas, or medications.  He was evaluated by the
floor team and found to have a lactate of 5.6 and a dirty UA.
He developed a worsening anion gap and was evaluated by surgery
who suggested an upright CXR to exclude free air (negative) and
a CT abdomen w/ oral contrast to eval the bowel (pending).  They
wished to follow the patient clinically for the time being
pending the results of the CT scan.


Past Medical History:
HTN
4+ MR
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia


Social History:
He is married for 62 years. He has two children who live nearby.
He is a retired orthotist.
.


Family History:
no family history of pulmonary disease.

Physical Exam:
Gen: Elderly [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] lying in bed appearing uncomfortable and mildly
tachypneic
HEENT: EOMI, MMM, OP clear
Lungs: crackles RLL, decreased breath sounds and dullness to
percussion LUL and RLL
CV: RRR, III/VI SEM
Abd: Non-distended, soft, moderate tenderness to palpation in
the epigastric area, no rebound/guarding, mild BS, guaiac
negative
Extrem: No c/c/e

[**8-19**] CT chest:
1. Worsening multifocal pneumonia, not hemorrhagic. Multifocal
interstitial abnormalities are either progression of organizing
pneumonia or edema.
2. New bilateral pleural effusions, larger in the left side.
.
[**8-27**] renal u/s:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. Left pleural effusion.
.
[**8-28**] CT abd:
No evidence of any ischemic bowel given that this is a
non-contrast CT.
Multiple lesions in the liver which are unchanged.
Some minimal presacral fluid and some minimal fluid in the
pelvis of unknown etiology.
Sigmoid diverticula.
Scarring right base and bilateral effusions.
.
[**8-28**] CXR:
There is no evidence of free air on the supine views. The bowel
gas pattern is nonspecific, with air seen within non-dilated
loops of small bowel and throughout the colon to the rectum. No
evidence of obstruction. There are surgical clips in the right
upper quadrant, likely related to cholecystectomy.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 84 y/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4746**] with h/o HTN, severe MR, and [**Hospital **] transferred to
the ICU for abdominal pain and rising lactate/wbc.  Please HPI
for details of admission prior to ICU:
.
1. Abdominal pain- on transfer,  ddx includes perforated viscus
and mesenteric ischemia.  recent CTA showed no evidence of AAA.
possible gastritis/ulcer dz w/ high dose steroids and
hospitalization.  surgery following and KUB w/out evidence of
colonic obstruction or free air. lactate continued to rise
following ICU transfer, despite elevated CVP and lack of
respiratory variation, both indicative of volume repletion.
patient continued to have minimal abdominal pain but did have
other signs of poor cardiac output including a mixed venous sat
of 42%.  on the day of the patient's demise, his lactate was
8.6.
.
.
2. crpytogenic organizing pna- seen on prior needle biopsy and
some improvementon high dose steroids (radiographic). O2 sats
stable on NC but significant desaturation with any activity.  on
[**8-29**] in the process of being rolled, the patient became acutely
SOB and subsequently became apneic.  per his family's documented
request, a Code was not called.   he subsequently expired.
.
3. [**Name (NI) 10271**] pt /w baseline creatinine of ~1.4 but elevated to 2.7 on
micu admission.    renal ultrasound today w/out evidence of
obstruction/hydronephrosis.  continued to worsen in the setting
of poor cardiac output.
.
4. Severe MR: pt in the process of preparing for a MVR prior to
this admission.  major contributor to the patient's poor forward
flow.
.
5. Coagulopathy: Initially likely [**1-23**] poor nutritional status
but now concern for DIC in setting of mesenteric ischemia
