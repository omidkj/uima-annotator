UPRIGHT AP CHEST: There is no short interval change in the
appearance of the chest, or lung parenchyma in particular. There
is no evidence of edema or other new opacities. Cardiac and
mediastinal contours are stable. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. The right PIC tip overlies the cavoatrial
junction. Calcifications in the abdomen are noted related to
chronic pancreatitis.

IMPRESSION: No short interval change in the appearance of the
chest.

MRI brain: IMPRESSION: Signal abnormality in the right temporal
lobe now demonstrates peripheral enhancement. In addition, a
small punctate area of enhancement is identified along the
midline in left posterior frontal lobe. Given the presence of
two lesions, metastatic disease is suspected. No mass or
hydrocephalus seen.

Transfusion History:
Three non-reactive transfusion at [**Hospital1 18**] (unit from [**2182-9-29**] was
[**Doctor Last Name **]-negative)
One non-reactive plasma transfusion

DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a new

diagnosis of Anti-K antibody. K-antigen is a member of the [**Doctor Last Name **]
blood
group systems. Anti-K antibody is clinically significant and
capable of
causing hemolytic transfusion reactions. The unit of blood Mr.
[**Known lastname **]
received on [**2182-9-29**] was K-antigen negative; thus there is no
special
concern for delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction due to a
K-antibody
interaction with that unit. Approximately 91% of ABO compatible
blood
will be K-antigen negative. A wallet card and a letter stating
the
above will be sent to the patient.

DIAGNOSIS:

FNA, 8th rib lesion: The tumor cells are positive for
cytokeratin, consistent with epithelial phenotype.  Please see
cytology report (C-[**Numeric Identifier 56567**]) for diagnosis.

Clinical: 62 year old male with history of lung ca with
pathologic rib fracture.
