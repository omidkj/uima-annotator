Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p vfib arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubation
2. Mechanical Ventilation
3. Femoral line
4. Cardiac catheterization with stenting to LAD
5. Right radial arterial line

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3694**] is a 57 year old male with history of mild
hyperlipidemia who presents s/p VF arrest. Pt was playing
basketball, and his legs buckled, and he fell to the ground, and
hit his head. CPR was started at the scene until the EMS
arrived, ~7-10mins per report. When EMS arrived, CPR was
continued, and he was shocked x3, subsequent asystole, and then
into PEA. CPR was continued until he arrived at the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. In
the ED, she was given Epi, Atropine, and Bicarb with return of
pulse. ECG demonstrated STE in V2-V3, aVL...
Placed on arctic sun after CT head negative for ICH and sent to
cath lab. Urine tox positive for opioids, but negative
otherwise. Serum tox negative.
.
In the cardiac cath lab, he was found to have a mid-LAD
completely occluded, with DES x1 placed, with return of good
flow. LCx was without disease, and RCA with 40-50% disease. He
required Levophed on low dose continued during the cath. He was
loaded with Prasugrel in the lab, and continued on Integrillin
for 1 hr.
.
Unable to obtain complete ROS given pt intubated and sedated.
Per his wife, prior to this, he was in his usual state of
health. She denied him reporting and chest pressure, pain, or
SOB. His only recent complaints were a mild knee injury.
Otherwise he had been feeling well. He is quite active and uses
an arc trainer at home. He also plays with his 6 year old son.

STUDIES:
CARDIAC CATH [**2180-3-14**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrated severe single vessel disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent disease.  The LAD had an eccentric 50%

proximal stenosis followed by a mid-occlusion after the 1st
setpal and
diagonal.  The 1st diagonal had 50% origin and mid stenoses.
The LCx
was a large, dominant vessel without angiographic CAD.   The RCA
was
non-dominant and had a 50% mid-stenosis.
2. Limited hemodynamics revealed a central aortic pressure of
117/82
mmHg while the patient was on 0.03 mcg/kg/min of Levophed.
3. Successful Export Thrombectomy and direct stenting of mid LAD
with
3.0 X 18 mm ENDEAVOR DES at 12 atms, post dilated with 3.0 mm NC
balloon
at 16 atms. Final angiogram showed 0% residual stensosis, no
dissection
and normal flow.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe one vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Coma post cardiac arrest.
3. Cardiogenic shock.
4. Successful [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAD

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe one vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Coma post cardiac arrest.
3. Cardiogenic shock.

CT HEAD W/O [**2180-3-14**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process; specifically no
intracranial
hemorrhage.
.
CXR [**2180-3-14**]:
IMPRESSION: Limited study. Probable retrocardiac atelectasis.
ETT in standard position.
.
CXR [**2180-3-15**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
endotracheal tube might have been minimally advanced. Otherwise,
the radiograph is unchanged, with borderline size of the cardiac
silhouette, partial right upper lobe atelectasis and bilateral
perihilar opacities suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.

.
EEG: IMPRESSION: This prolonged continuous EEG showed an
extremely
suppressed background rhythm early on [**2180-3-15**] during
hypothermia treatment. Over the day, the background improved in
voltage
and frequency. By the end, it showed an encephalopathic pattern
with
slow frequencies in all areas. There were no prominent focal
abnormalities. There were no clearly epileptiform features.
.
TTE [**2180-3-15**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid
to distal septal, anterior, distal/apical akinesis. The basal
lateral wall moves best. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
MRI [**2180-3-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
Diffusion abnormalities in the biparietal cortex, predominantly
in the medial parietal lobes, compatible with ischemic injury or
post-ictal state.
.
MRI [**2180-3-25**]:
IMPRESSION: Bilateral parietal cortical and subcortical
diffusion
abnormalities are noted which indicate progression to white
matter of the
previously noted ischemic lesions secondary to hypoxic injury.
Bilateral
globus pallidi lesions are also noted. No hemorrhage, mass
effect or
hydrocephalus.

.
CTAP [**2180-3-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. 5.8 x 3.2 cm hematoma within the right pelvis may be related
to recent
catheterization procedure. Bilateral fat stranding within the
groins
compatible with instrumentation.
2. Areas of hypodensity and hyperdensity within the left iliacus
and psoas
muscles bilaterally and expansion of the left iliacus. The
increased density suggests this is atleast mostly hemorrhage,
however, given multifocal findings, septic emboli/abscesses are
a consideration.
3. New hyperdense foreign body within the stomach. In a patient
intubated
with feeding tube, foreign body from dental origin is a
possibility.
