History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 12731**] is an 83 year old man with a past medical
history of multiple medical problems including ESRD on HD, CAD
s/p MI, GIBs, Afib not on anticoagulation, multiple previous [**Known lastname 12916**]
(MRSA, ESBL E. coli, VSE) s/p fall with C2 fracture [**4-28**]. He
ultimately required admission for surgical repair for
progressive collapse s/p ORIF C2 and posterior instrumentation
C1-C5 and left iliac crest bone graft placement [**7-31**]. He was
recently readmitted ([**Date range (3) 12950**]) for treament of iliac
crest bone graft site infection and discharged to rehab on a six
week course of ertapenem. He presents today from dialysis with
reports of intermittent confusion and drowsiness at HD followed
by a short episode of tremor/shaking with decreased
responsiveness. Patient's family and rehab reportedly endorsed a
history of intermittent confusion over the last few days.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.6, BP 127/70, HR 80, RR 16,
O2 sat 98% 2L. CT head, CXR, EKG were unrevealing. Labs were
notable for troponin 0.04 (baseline), WBC 6.4, HCT 38 (above
baseline), Cr 1.8, and LFTs within normal limits. His exam
revealed no new focal neurologic deficits and no evidence of
confusion. He received no interventions prior to admission to
the medicine service.
.
On arrival to the floor patient denies any specific health
complaints. He states he fell asleep at HD and was told that he
was shaking so they brought him to the hospital. He states that
they told him his words were garbled. He denies feeling any
confusion now and is oriented x 3. He denies any changes in his
health since his recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**]. He denies chest
pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark or bloody stools,
constipation, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of
breath, cough, headache, rash, dysuria, pelvic pain. He is
unaware of any recent changes in his medications. He does not
believe he missed any dialysis sessions. He denies any falls or
traumas. He reports his pain is well controlled. He reports the
only recent change has been his decreased sleep. He states that
a few days ago he got a new roommate at rehab who requires alot
of assistance and keep him awake all hours of the night. He
thinks its been three days since he's gotten any significant
sleep.
