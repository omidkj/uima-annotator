CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from an outside hospital with
abdominal pain and small pockets of free air on CT scan.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] is a very pleasant 83-year-
old woman with multiple medical problems, history of breast
and bladder cancer who approximately 1 year prior to this
presentation had an aortic aneurysm repaired at our facility.
The patient presented to an outside institution with 2 days
of right lower quadrant pain that progressed to diffuse
abdominal distention and lower abdominal pain.  She stopped
having bowel movements although she did have flatus. She
reported some reflux without dysphagia. She presented to an
outside hospital with these complaints with CT scan that
showed pockets of free air in the pelvis but a difficult to
interpret CT in the setting of bilateral total hip
replacement. The patient was transferred to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] because of her previous operation at
this institution on [**2188-1-23**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, breast
cancer, bladder cancer, hypertension, COPD, gastroesophageal
reflux, hypercholesterolemia and osteoarthritis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Right total hip replacement, aortic
aneurysm repair in [**2187-3-29**], left mastectomy, cystoscopy
with bladder biopsies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Zocor.
2.  Atenolol.
3.  Multivitamins.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denies alcohol. She is a long time
smoker and was smoking [**12-30**] pack per day prior to admission.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for aortic aneurysms.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature was 97.6, heart rate
113, blood pressure 115/70, respiratory rate 24, and she was
saturating 96% on 3 liters. She appeared cachectic, pale but
alert. Sclerae were nonicteric. Mucous membranes were dry.
Her neck was supple. Heart was tachycardic but regular. Chest
with diminished breath sounds bilaterally with scattered
rhonchi. Her abdomen was distended. She had right lower
quadrant tenderness to palpation. She had hepatomegaly with
no splenomegaly. She had firm stool in her vault without
masses. She was guaiac positive. There was no tenderness.
Extremities were warm with palpable pedal pulses. She could
move all extremities.

Her white blood cell count was 16,000, her hematocrit was 34,
platelet count 210. She had BUN and creatinine of 22, and
1.2. Her potassium was 3.2. She had an AST of 58 and total
bilirubin of 2.5 and alkaline phosphatase of 162, amylase of
100 and albumin of 3.3. Her coag profile was normal.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 9858**] was
admitted to the surgical service with lower abdominal pain
and trace of free air on CAT scan. She was given intravenous
antibiotics and made NPO. A repeat CAT scan showed less free
air than on previous CAT scan and a chest CT was suggestive
of lung cancer with suggestion of metastases with replacement
of her liver. Given her underlying malignancy and diffuse
metastatic disease, nonoperative management was attempted for
this abdominal process which was thought to be
diverticulitis. She was started on parenteral nutrition and
fluid resuscitation was initiated. Discussion with the family
regarding her finding of probable lung cancer was
entertained. With broad-spectrum antibiotics and serial
exams, her condition stabilized although her abdominal
examination continued to worsen. Repeat CT scan of the
abdomen and pelvis was performed on [**2188-1-27**], which
showed worsening small bowel obstruction. Given the CT
findings and her increase in white blood cell count, risks
and benefits of an operative procedure were discussed. The
family wanted to proceed with surgical intervention.
Therefore on [**2188-1-28**], the patient was taken to the
operating room for exploratory laparotomy with drainage of
phlegmon and lysis of adhesions. Drains were placed in the
pelvis and the patient was returned to the ICU for close
monitoring.

Her postoperative course was remarkable for worsening
hepatorenal failure secondary to her replaced liver with
tumor. Her respiratory status deteriorated. She did not want
to be intubated. Supportive therapy was initiated with BiPAP
and other measures. Her ventilatory status initially mildly
improved and then further deteriorated with worsening renal
failure and mental status.

After discussing the patient's condition with her two sons,
she was made comfort measures only and no further
interventions were implemented. She subsequently expired on
[**2188-1-31**], with no resuscitation initiated secondary
to the patient's and family's wishes. She was declared
expired on [**2188-1-31**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Deceased.
