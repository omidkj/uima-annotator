Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2104-1-15**] PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-12**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-12**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results before surgical incision.
POST-BYPASS: Preserved biventricular systolic function. LVEF
55%. Intact thoracic aorta. The aortic bioprosthesis is stable,
functioning well with peak 18 and meann 9 mm of Hg. Mild MR.

[**2105-1-18**] CXR: Post-sternotomy wires and replaced aortic valve are
unremarkable. There is overall improvement in the aeration of
both lungs with still present opacities seen in right upper,
right lower, and left lower lung. There is small amount of
bilateral pleural effusion still present. There is no evidence
of pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62 year old male with known aortic stenosis and
coronary artery disease who was a same day admission into the
operating room for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass
grafting with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Please see the operative report for
details, in summary he had Aortic valve replacement and Coronary
artery bypass grafting x 2. His bypass time was 121 minutes,
with a cross clamp time of 101 minutes. He tolerated the
operation well and post-operatively was transferred to the
cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition on Neo-Synephrine to
support his blood pressure. In the immediate post-op period he
remained hemodynamically stable, anesthesia was reversed-he woke
neurologically intact and was extubated. On post-op day one he
was started on diuretics and beta-blockers and transferred to
the stepdown floor for continued recovery. All tubes, lines, and
drips were removed per cardiac surgery protocol. Once on the
floor he worked with nursing and physical therapy to advance his
activity and endurance. The remainder of his hospital course was
uneventful. He was discharged to Lifecare of [**Location (un) 2199**] with
visiting nurses on post-op day six. He is to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] in 1 month.
