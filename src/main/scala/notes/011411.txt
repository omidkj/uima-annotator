Chief Complaint:
hypotension, AMS

History of Present Illness:
62-year-old male with
intractable cancer pain secondary to hepatocellular carcinoma,
anasarca related to cirrhosis, ESRD on hemodialysis, diabetes
with nephropathy, retinopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and
neuropathy who presents with altered mental status.  Per the
HCP, the patient had had some increased respiratory distress
recently with increased wheezing which responded to nebs.
Today, he was noted to be more somnolent and altered, not
responding as he usually does so he was brought to the ED.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.6 91 87/55 17 100% RA.  He was
initially hypotensive and bradypneic and was given narcan with
good response in resp status.  Per report, family was [**First Name3 (LF) 653**]
and wished for everything to be done for him.  Labs showed
leukocytosis to 13.5, H&H 10.0/31.2, lactate of 2.9.  UA showed
many bacteria, > 192 WBC, +leuk.  He had a LIJ CVL placed and
was given vanco 1gm and ceftriaxone 2gm IV.  On transfer, vitals
were: 114, 132/100, 18-22, 99%2L.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS: 91 11 99% 3L.  He is
somnolent, but does open his eyes to name and attempts to answer
simple questions.

IMAGING
[**6-10**] CXR
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:
A right-sided tunneled line terminates at the upper right
atrium, unchanged in position since [**2112-12-13**]. An
overlying EKG lead along the left neck limits evaluation of line
placement in this region. The heart size is normal.
The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
There is no
pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural effusion. The
right
costophrenic angle is excluded from the study.
IMPRESSION: A new central access line tip in addition to a known
tunneled
line could not be visualized. A repeat study could be performed
with improved EKG lead placement and better patient positioning.

.
[**6-17**] EEG
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: The background consists of a low voltage,
disorganized,
delta frequency rhythm seen throughout the recording without any
clear
state changes.
BACKGROUND: Same as Abnormality #1.
HYPERVENTILATION: Not performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Not performed.
SLEEP: No clear state changes are seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: A single EKG channel shows a regular
tachycardia.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a low

voltage, disorganized, slow background, mostly in the delta
frequency
range without state changes. These findings suggest the presence
of a
severe diffuse encephalopathy which indicates widespread
cerebral
dysfunction but is non-specific as to etiology. There
