History of Present Illness:
This 74 year old male has a history of aortic stenosis and
atrial fibrillation, and he has been followed by his
cardiologist.  He has been having occasional chest pain twinges
which last for a few seconds and are non exertional.  He decided
to proceed with an aortic valve replacement and underwent
cardiac cath at [**Hospital6 3105**] today which revealed
non obstructive placque of the LAD, dominant LCX, and minor
diffuse placque of the RCA.  His [**Location (un) 109**] was 0.4 cm2 and he has 1+AI
with a mean gradient of 50mmHg and 2+MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] is now transferred
for AVR/MAZE.

Carotid Bruit- none

Pertinent Results:
[**2151-3-19**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA no stenosis. Left ICA no stenosis.


[**2151-3-22**] Echo: Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is
present in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-13**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**12-13**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
Post Bypass: The patient is now s/p a [**Company 1543**] 27 bioprosthetic
porcine valve replacement. The patient is on a neosynephrine
drip at 1mcg/kg/min. The Cardiac index is 2.1. There is now a
well seated bioprosthetic aortic valve with no paravalvular
leaks and a mean gradient of 4mmhg. The LV function is preserved
and is similar to prebypass. The aorta is intact post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 7280**] was transferred from outside
hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical management. Upon admission he
underwent surgical work-up while receiving medical management
(including Heparin bridge for atrial fibrillation). Work-up
included dental clearance. On [**2151-3-22**] he was ready for surgery
and was brought to the operating room where he underwent an
aortic valve replacement and MAZE procedure including LAA
ligation. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented.  Lasix
drip was initiated for pulmonary edema resulting in hypoxia.
This resolved and he was transitioned to PO Lasix.  The patient
was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned
from inotropic and vasopressor support by POD 3.  Beta blocker
was initiated as well as amiodarone and coumadin for chronic
atrial fibrillation.  Diamox was given for contraction
alkalosis.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor
for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  He was evaluated by thoracic
surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a pulmonary nodule.  He will
follow up in clinic as an outpatient.  The patient was evaluated
by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 10 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
