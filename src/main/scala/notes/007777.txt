CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Congestive heart failure

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2646**] is an 81-year-old
man who presented to [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department on
[**2166-8-4**] in congestive heart failure.  He had complained of
increasing dyspnea on exertion times 3 weeks worsening with
some chest pressure on the day of presentation.  An echo at
that time revealed an anterior wall motion abnormality.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
cardiac catheterization.

The cardiac catheterization done on the day of transfer
revealed left main and 3-vessel coronary artery disease with
a small infrarenal triple A and LVEDP of 30 and an index of
1.56.  He was then referred for coronary artery bypass
grafting  plus/minus mitral valve replacement.  An intra-
aortic balloon pump was placed at the time of cardiac
catheterization and the patient was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for remote history of
tuberculosis per the patient.  Treatment is unclear.  Denies
any other medical problems.  [**Name (NI) **] not seen a physician in over
50 years.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  An occasional aspirin.  No other
medications.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM [**Location (un) **]:
1. Lasix
2. Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d.
3. Aspirin
4. Potassium chloride
5. Zestril 2.5 once daily
6. Zocor 40 once daily


SOCIAL HISTORY:  Not a smoker.  Rare alcohol use; 1 to 2
drinks per year.  Walks greater than 2 miles per day until 2
to 3 weeks ago, at which time he became increasingly
dyspneic.  Lives with his girlfriend, and sister also lives
in the area.  He has children who live in [**State 4565**].

LABORATORY DATA ON THE DAY OF ADMISSION:  White count 7.4,
hematocrit 36.5, platelets 193, INR 1.3, PTT 33.3, sodium
137, potassium 4.1, chloride 100, CO2 26, BUN 34, creatinine
1.4, glucose 127.  LFTs were normal.  Alkaline phosphatase
75, AST 54, ALT 35, LDH 138, HDL 24, BNP 1550, troponin 0.06,
CK of 49.

EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 125 with PVCs, normal axis,
left bundle branch versus anterior Q waves.

The patient spent the next several days in the Coronary Care
Unit while he was trying to decide whether or not he wished
to pursue coronary artery bypass grafting.  During this
period he was followed by the Medical team.  Ultimately, the
patient agreed to coronary artery bypass grafting, and on
[**2166-8-11**] he was brought to the Operating Room.  Please see
the OR report for full details.

In summary, the patient had a CABG times 3 with LIMA to the
LAD, saphenous vein graft to the PDA, saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal, and mitral valve repair with a No. 30
annuloplasty ring, St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**].  His bypass time was 113 minutes
with a cross-clamp time of 91 minutes.  He tolerated the
operation well and was transferred from the Operating Room to
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of
transfer the patient was in a sinus rhythm at 93 beats per
minute.  His mean arterial pressure was 60 with a CVP of 8.
He had Milranone at 0.25 mcg/kg/minute, Neo-Synephrine at 2
mcg/kg/minute, epinephrine at 0.02 mcg/kg/minute, and
propofol at 20 mcg/kg/minute.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period,
although he did have significant coagulopathy.  He was given
blood products to correct this coagulopathy following which
he was kept sedated and intubated throughout the day of
surgery.  On postoperative day 1 patient continued to do
well.  He was hemodynamically stable.  His intra-aortic
balloon pump was weaned and ultimately discontinued.
However, following the patient's intra-aortic balloon pump
removal his pulses went intermittent, his foot was cool, and
Vascular Surgery Service was consulted and their
recommendation was made to begin heparin to prevent any
further deterioration.  The patient was also seen by
Interventional Cardiology, who considered attempting an
angioplasty.  Ultimately, a decision was made to follow a
surgical approach if intervention was required.

On postoperative day 2 patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  He was weaned from his ventilator and successfully
extubated.  An angiogram was done that showed a large
thrombus in the common femoral artery, and preparations were
made to bring the patient back to the Operating Room for a
right femoral thrombectomy with patch angioplasty.  Patient
tolerated this surgery well and returned to Cardiothoracic
ICU following this repair, at which time the patient had
Dopplerable dorsalis pedis as well as posterior tibial
signals.  His foot, which had been cool below the level of
the knee, was now cool only below the level of the ankle and,
within several hours, the patient's foot was no longer cool.

Patient stayed in the Cardiothoracic ICU for an additional
day, following which he was transferred to the floor for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
[**Hospital **] hospital course on the floor was uneventful.  His
activity level was increased with the assistance of the
nursing staff as well as the Physical Therapy staff and, on
[**2166-8-18**] it was decided that the patient was stable and
ready to be transferred to rehabilitation.  At that time the
patient's physical exam is as follows:  Vital signs:  97.5,
heart rate 74, blood pressure 120/74, respiratory rate 20, O2
sat 95 percent on room air (preoperatively 83.5 kg at
discharge, 85.8 kg).

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.9, hematocrit 31.3, platelets
221, sodium 135, potassium 4.0, chloride 102, CO2 27, BUN 35,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 112, PT 18.4, PTT 41.9, INR 2.1.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Neuro:  Alert and oriented times
three; moves all extremities; follows commands.  Respiratory:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm; S1, S2.  Sternum was stable; incision with
Steri-Strips; open to air; clean and dry.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended, with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm with 1 plus edema.  Left saphenous vein
graft site with Steri-Strips; open to air; clean and dry.
Right groin thrombectomy site with staples; clean and dry.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post coronary artery bypass
grafting times 3 with a left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal, saphenous vein graft to PDA.
