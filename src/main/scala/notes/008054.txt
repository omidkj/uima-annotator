Chief Complaint:
Asymptomatic with positive nuclear perfusion study


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2173-9-21**]
Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery x 2 Left internal mammory
artery
-> Left anterior descending and Reverse Saphenous vein graft ->
Obtuse marginal


History of Present Illness:
67 year old man with a history of coronary artery disease. Was
found to have 50% left main in [**2169**] and decided on medical
management. He currently is asymptomatic but recently underwent
an nuclear perfusion study which
demonstrated anteroapical ischemia with an ejection fraction of
57%. Therefore he was brought for a cardiac cath which now
showed 60-70% left main distal stenosis. He presents for
evaluation for surgical revascularization.
Cardiac Catheterization: Date: [**2173-8-12**]  Place: [**Hospital3 **]
60-70% distal left main, LAD with minor luminal irregularities,
LCx dominant vessel with minor luminal irregularities, RCA small
and normal, EF 76%


Past Medical History:
CVA [**2162**] -- no residual losses
S/P RCEA
COPD
HTN
Obesity
Hyperlipidemia

Social History:
Pt quit smoking 12 y/a smoked 1 day for many, many years.
Occassional ETOH, approx 2 beers every 2 weeks.
Pt works in sales and marketing.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Pertinent Results:
[**2173-9-21**]
LEFT ATRIUM: Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the body of the RA or RAA. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Mild symmetric LVH. Normal
LV cavity size. Doppler parameters are most consistent with
Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Physiologic
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.
Conclusions
PREBYPASS:
1.No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body
of the right atrium or the right atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The
left ventricular cavity size is normal.
4. Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild)
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
5. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
6.There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
7.There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
8. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
9.There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.
POSTBYPASS:
The patient is mainained on low dose phenylephrine infusion &
V-paced.
Biventricular function is maintained. There are no new wall
motion abnormalities.
The aorta remains intact.
Valve structure & function remain unchanged

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2173-9-21**] where the patient underwent Coronary
Artery Bypass Graft Surgery x 2. Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably. The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Beta blocker was initiated and titrated up and the patient was
gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. CPAP for known
obstructive sleep apnea was initiated with his home settings.
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD #4 he was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  Mr.[**Known lastname 1250**]
was discharged to [**Doctor First Name 391**] [**Hospital **] Rehab in good condition with
follow up instructions advised.
