Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH with chest pain for consideration of cardiac
catheterization.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Drug eluting stent to RCA
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
79 yoF PMH CAD s/p CABG [**12/2172**]
(SVG->LAD, SVG->OM, SVG->RCA), HTN, DM II, COPD, presented to an
OSH ED after falling off of her chair at home.  Her husband
called EMS and she complained of having chest pain for the prior
four days, described as substernal chest pressure, rated [**9-8**].
She denied SOB, LH, or palpitation.  She did endorse some nausea
and lower extremity edema recently.
.
At the OSH she wsa noted to have ST elevations in I and L and
new Q waves in the same.  He Trop I was 10.6 (unknown lab
standard) with normal CK-MB fraction.  Four hours later repeat
Trop was 14.  She was given SL NTG for relief of her CP with
intermittant success.
.
She was given ASA 325, plavix 400 mg times one, Integrellin 1
mg/kg, Heparin gtt, lipitor 80, lopressor 75 tid.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for cardiac catheterization.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for 4/10 chest pain on
arrival which resolved spontaneously; she denies dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope. She has some lt. ankle edema.

ECG Study Date of [**2180-4-20**]  11:24:08 PM
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Frequent atrial ectopy.
Prior anterior wall myocardial infarction. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2173-1-21**] there is new T wave inversion in
leads V4-V6 and associated ST segment depression which may
represent an active lateral ischemic process. Frequent atrial
ectopy has appeared, while the intrinsic rate has slowed. Rule
out infarction. Followup and clinical correlation are suggested.

Cardiac catheterization report:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
a 50%
stenosis at its origin.  The LAD had diffuse disease to 100% in
the mid
vessel.  The LCx had diffuse disease to 80% in the mid vessel.
The LCx
obtuse marginal branch had a 95% stenosis.  The RCA had difuse
disease
distally to 80% and give rise to R->L collaterals that supplied
the OM.
2. Vein graft angiography revealed a totally occluded SVG-OM and

SVG-RCA.  The SVG-LAD was patent with luminal irregularities to
40%.
3. Central aortic pressure was normal at 116/51
(systolic/diastolic in
mmHg).
4. [**Name (NI) 9927**] PTCA and stenting of the Right coronary artery with
a 3.00
Cypher DES. The final angiogram demonstrated no residual
stenosis with
no angiographic evidence of dissection, embolization or
perforation with
TIMI III flow in the distal vessel.  (See PTCA comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. PTCA to the RCA.

.
CXR [**2180-4-21**]
Moderate cardiomegaly more pronounced, particularly due to left
atrial enlargement. Pulmonary vasculature engorgement is present
but there is no edema or pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
.
ECHO [**2180-4-21**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection
fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the
anterior free wall, lateral wall, and posterior wall, with
extensive apical akinesis; the basal and midventricular segments
of the inferior free wall contract best. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse.  Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year-old female with known CAD s/p CABG who presented to OSH
after fall at home complaining of 4 days of CP found to have
STEMI by new ST elevations transitioning to Q waves in I and AVL
prior to transfer and positive Troponin I suggestive of subacute
ST elevation MI.  Hospital course is as follows:
.
#. Coronary artery disease: Patient status post CABG in [**2172**] and
now DES to RCA on this admission for subacute STEMI. The patient
was initially maintained on heparin, integrilin, and
nitroglycerin drips for control of chest pain in addition to
aspirin, plavix, beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor, and high-dose
statin. No further evidence of active ischemia. The patient's
outpatient regimen is unknown, but prior to discharge, she was
instructed multiple times to be sure to take her Plavix given
her stent placement. She stated that she understood the risks of
not taking and will be comp
