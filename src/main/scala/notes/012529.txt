Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] M with history of Afib, dCHF EF 55%, CAD s/p 3V-CABG, HTN,
DMII, PVD, HL presents from PCP office for severe fatigue and
cough over the last 2 weeks.  He has a long standing (>2 year)
dry cough that became productive 2 weeks ago after grandkids,
who were sick with URI type symptoms, visited.  He became more
drowsy, and had more DOE.  He is able to cooks simple meals for
himself, but was becoming tired walking to bathroom for the past
few days.  He also reported developing left side chest pain
yesterday- pleuritic, non-radiating.  He reports having calf
pain, which has been going on for years.

In clinic, he was noted to be very drowsy, bradycardic, and
hypotensive so was referred to the ED.  Baseline BP usually in
110-130s.

In the ED, initial vitals were 96.9 37 68/31 16 98%.  He was
given 500cc bolus of IVF with marginal response in hemodynamics
to BP of 75/40.  Peripheral dopamine was started with a good
increase in his HR and BP.  CVL was subsequently placed.
Dopamine dosing was as high as 15, but was weaned to 5 by the
time he was transferred to the floor.  Given his cough, he was
initially given a dose of levofloxacin and clindmycin.  CXR was
a poor study.

He had recently been undergoing aggressive diuresis for leg
edema as an outpatient.  His primary cardiologist had been
worried about primary bradycardia (was in 40-50's) and had
ordered an event monitor, which does not appear to have been
performed yet.  At the time, there was also concern for TIA, so
MRI head was obtained which showed no vascular occlusion,
stenosis, or an aneurysm >3 mm.

Vitals prior to transfer were: 90, 130/60, 15, 98% 2-3L

On cardiac review of systems, he denies chest pain, dyspnea,
orthopnea, PND, syncope, presyncope, and palpitations.  No other
pertinent positives on general review of systems

TTE [**2137-3-20**]:
Imaging:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the basal inferior and infero-lateral walls. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55%). The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen.There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the prior study dated [**2136-10-29**] (images
reviewed), the wall motion abnormalities described above were
present but not reported on the prior echocardiogram.
