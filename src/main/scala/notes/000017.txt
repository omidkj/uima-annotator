Right pneumothorax post surgery with three chest tubes in place

[**9-7**] CXR
Interval removal of the right basilar chest tube.  There
continues to be
some subcutaneous emphysema within the right lateral chest wall
soft tissues.  Post-surgical changes of the right hemithorax and
lung are stable.  Stable right lateral pleural thickening and
right basilar pleural thickening could be post-operative or
represent some pleural fluid.  However, the appearance is
stable.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The left lung remains well
inflated and clear.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
stable.  Clips in the right upper quadrant are consistent with
cholecystectomy.  No pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**2126-8-30**] to the thoracic surgery service
for a planned right thoracotomy, right lower lobe wedge
resection with decortication. She tolerated the procedure well,
was extubated and recovered in the PACU prior to being
transferred to the ICU in stable condition. For full details
please see the operative report. Three chest tubes were placed
during the procedure and a postoperative chest x-ray showed
expected right pneumothorax post surgery with three chest tubes
in place. Pathology revealed a 1.8 cm poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma with negative margins and no positive nodes. She
was started on a clear liquid diet, her pain was controlled with
an epidural and she was started on her home medications. On POD
1 her diet was advanced to regular and she was transferred to
the surgical floor from the ICU. On POD 2 she was noted to have
increased somnolence which was thought to be related to her pain
medications so her epidural was turned down and narcotics for
breakthrough pain were discontinued. She was given a unit of
PRBC for a Hct of 20.3 with an appropriate increase to 24.4 and
improved somnolence. On POD 3 metoprolol was started because of
elevated systolic blood pressures. She continued to have an air
leak from all three chest tubes. Her epidural was discontinued
and her foley catheter was removed. She was started on oxycodone
and tramadol for pain. By POD 4 the air leak had stopped in the
anterior chest tube so it was removed. The posterior chest tube
was removed on POD 6. On POD 7 she noted that she felt dizzy
when she was getting out of bed and was found to be in atrial
fibrillation with RVR. She was given metoprolol once without
effect and was then given IV diltiazem once with return to sinus
rhythm. Cardiac enzymes were negative and she was monitored with
telemetry without recurrence. On POD 8 the air leak had resolved
in the basilar chest tube so it was removed. A post pull chest
xray showed no PTX. Because her pain was well controlled, she
was tolerating her diet and was ambulating without assistance,
she was discharged to home on POD 9 with instructions to follow
up in Dr.[**Name (NI) 5067**] clinic with a chest x-ray.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for surgery on your lung. You
have done well after the procedure and may return home to
continue your recovery.
There is a dressing over the site of your chest tube- this may
be removed in 24 hours. You can leave the incision open to air
after that. You may shower with the dressing in place.
Please take the prescribed pain medication as needed.
Constipation can be a problem with narcotic use, therefore drink
plenty of fluid to stay well hydrated and use a stool softener
while taking narcotics. Do NOT drive while taking narcotic pain
medications.

While in the hospital, you were noticed to have a heart rhythm
called atrial fibrillation. We were able to convert the rhythm
back to normal using medication; please ask your primary care
doctor if you need further tests or treatment. We also started
you on a new medication called Metoprolol for your high blood
pressure and new dysrhythmia, please ask your primary care
doctor if you need to continue it.
If you develop any chest pain, shortness of breath or any other
symptoms that concern you, please call your surgeon or go to the
nearest Emergency Room.
