Chief Complaint:
fever.

pericardiocentesis
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo f with PMH CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, severe alzheimer's
dementia presents with fever. Pt was evaluated at NH by visiting
for a reported fever of 101,wheezing, SOB, CP. Visiting RN noted
pt to have low grade temp 99.4. She was noted to have O2 89-91%
at rest and 88% on ambulation, with respir rate 40. Tachycardic
to 110. Pt was noted to be confused, not at baseline. Pt has not
had flu vaccine (family refused). CXR on [**2-23**] - negative.
.
Here, pt is aggitated and unable to provide accurate history.
However, she denies recent fever,chills, cough, CP, SOB, n/v/abd
pain, diarrhea, urinary sx
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was given ceftriaxone and azithro, ativan.

Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:
.
[**2135-3-2**] TTE:
Conclusions:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal with grossly preserved systolic function.
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a small
pericardial effusion which is somewhat echo dense consistent
with
organization. The pericardium is probably thickened. There are
no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-3-1**],
there is no
significant change.
.
[**2135-3-1**] Righ heart cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Hemodynamic assessment revealed equalization of pericardial,
right
atrial and wedge pressures at 17 mm Hg. X and Y descents were
blunted.
Cardiac index was preserved at 3.5. Pulsus was 23 mm Hg.
2. Pericardial space was cannulated and 700 cc of bloody fluid
was
drained with pericardial pressure dropping from 17 to 3 mm Hg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate pericardial tamponade.
.
[**2135-3-1**] TTE:
Conclusions:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right atrial or
right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2135-2-28**], the pericardial effusion is much smaller.
.
[**2135-2-28**] TTE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure
could not be determined. There is a moderate to large
circumferential
pericardial effusion with evidence for right atrial diastolic
collapse. No
right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-large circumferential pericardial
effusion with
evidence of increased pericardial pressure. Mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic
function.

IMPRESSION: Massive cardiomegaly, suggestive of pericardial
effusion.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2135-2-25**] 6:25 PM
