Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath/Fatigue


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2182-2-13**] 1. Left thoracotomy and placement of epicardial left
    ventricular pacing lead.
2. Repositioning automatic implantable cardioverter
    defibrillator/biventricular pacer generator.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a very ill appearing 63 year old gentleman with a
relevant past medical history notable for cardiomyopathy and
ventricular tachycardia. He underwent placement of an AICD/PPM
in [**2175**] and subsequent LV lead placement in [**2178**] for
biventricular pacing for heart failure. He developed a pocket
infection and the superficial portion of the LV leads were
extracted along with the ICD/PPM in [**2180**]. He later underwent
reimplantation of his AICD/PPM in [**8-29**] but now requires an LV
lead for biventricular pacing to help reduce his heart failure
symptoms. Over the past 1.5 months he has become profoundly
dyspneic with minimal activity and has severe peripheral edema.
Given the worsening of
his heart failure symptoms, he has been referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]
for LV lead placement for biventricular pacing.

Past Medical History:
1.  Nonischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic systolic heart failure.
2.  Mitral regurgitation with pulmonary hypertension.
3.  Ventricular tachycardia s/p ICD implantation [**2175**]
4.  COPD.
5.  Morbid obesity.
6.  Spinal stenosis.
7.  Right malignant renal tumor, s/p right nephrectomy
8.  Stage 4 chronic renal failure.
9.  Hypertension.
10. Leg ulcers.
11. Gout

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  20% to 25%  >= 55%
TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP):  *30 to 32 mm Hg  <= 25 mm Hg
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severely dilated LV cavity. Severely depressed
LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Markedly dilated RV cavity. Severe global RV
free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate [2+]
TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
