Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
obstructive cholangitis, need for ERCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2139-9-12**] ERCP with sphincterotomy
[**2139-9-14**] PICC placement 55cm


History of Present Illness:
HPI: [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMhx of severe aortic stenosis, diverticular
disease and hypothyroid presented to an OSH on [**9-11**] with vague
complaints of crampy abdominal pain and nausea for 2-3 days.
Per OSH records, pt denied F/C/V/D.  Pt is a difficult historian
and was mildly disoriented on presentation per family and OSH
records.  OSH Labs were notable for a Alk Phos 184, Tbili 2.2,
SGOT 986, SGPT 467 and normal amylase/lipase.  Pt underwent CT
that showed gallstones, otherwise normal. RUQ u/s showed sludge
and probably small stones in GB, no thickening of GB wall, all
hepatic ducts normal size.  (?  Repeat WBC ct elevated at 14
with left shift.  Blood Cx reportedly positive for gram neg
rods.  There was a question about Mobitz type II heart block and
cardiology was asked to evaluate, but pt was discussed with GI
at [**Hospital1 18**] and it was felt that transfer for ERCP was urgent,
cardiology consult was deferred.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]: the patient's vital signs were T 100.1, VS
117/40, HR 70, RR 24, Sats 97% on 4L.  Pt denied abd pain but
did c/o some nausea.  EKGs & telemetry strips were obtained and
faxed to cardiology who felt that the tracings were consistent
with first degree AV block.  Pt received Zosyn and GI/ERCP
fellow came to evaluate and plan for ERCP in am.  Upon sleeping,
pt developped Wenkebach 2nd degree heart block, SBPs dipped down
into 70s briefly while she was sleeping and responded to 250cc
bolus.

ECG: NSR with LVH, no acute ST-T wave changes as compared to
prior tracings.
.
CXR: increased pulm vascular congestion, no overt pulm edema
.
Telemetry: episodes of wenckebach when sleeping, progressive
prolongation of PR followed by a dropped beat

Imaging:
========
CXR [**9-14**]:
Tip of the new left PIC line is between 4 and 5 cm beyond the
superior
cavoatrial junction in the right atrium. Mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly is
chronic. Today's study shows mild pulmonary vascular congestion
though no
pulmonary edema or mediastinal venous engorgement is present nor
is there any indication of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

ERCP [**9-12**]:
Normal intrahepatic ducts. Mildly dilated common bile duct.
Cystic duct not visualized.
Biliary sphincterotomy
Pus drainage post sphincterotomy and sweeping of the common bile
duct with balloon catheter.
Occlusion cholangiography did not reveal any stones or
stricture.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of severe AS now presenting with obstructive
cholangitis, blood Cx positive for GNRs and pulm edema.
.
# Ascending Cholangitis: Transaminitis, CT Abd withgallstones,
and  RUQ U/s showing sludge and probable small stones in GB, no
thickening of the wall, and CBD dilation to 11mm in the setting
of abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and transaminitis were
concerning for biliary sepsis. Blood Cx were positive for GNRs
(E coli pan sensitive) and pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
emergent ERCP which showed pus drainage post sphincterotomy, no
stent, occlusion cholangiography did not reveal any stones or
stricture.
-She was transfered to the MICU where patient was continued on
Zosyn 2.25mg IV q 8hr.
-Her BP remained within normal limits, LFTs trended down, and
her diet was advanced to clears then regular. She tolerated this
well.
-Her antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone to complete a two
week course. PICC line placed [**9-14**].
- She remained afebrile once on floor.
- Gastroenterology did recommend cholycysectomy but patient did
not want to pursue. Monitor lfts over next couple days.
- tolerating regular diet at r=discharge
.
# Pulm Edema/critical AS: CXR shows mild vascular engorgement.
ECHO report from [**Hospital1 2025**] showed severe AS with valve area of 0.4cm
and LVEF of 60%. Pt has clearly expressed wishes for DNR/DNI
status and has declined surgical intervention
- she weaned off O2 on [**9-14**] with RA sats in mid 90s. Did not
require any lasix.

# E coli Bacteremia [**2-28**] presumed bowel flora: blood cx sent both
here and at OSH.
- antibiotics narrowed to ceftriaxone and will complete two week
course of IV antibiotics. Surveillance cultures from [**Hospital1 18**] are
NGTD.

# ARF: [**2-28**] possible sepsis, with admission Creatinin 0.9 rising
to 1.6 at OSH and decreasing to normal levels with IVFs (1.1).
-Patient maintained good UOP (>30cc/hr) and tolerated PO well.
- foley was d/c'd on [**9-14**] and was voiding well without
difficulty. Cr 0.9 at discharge.
.
# Hypothyroidism: restarted Levothyroxine 150mcg once taking PO
(
.
# Code:  DNR/DNI confirmed with pt & HCP
