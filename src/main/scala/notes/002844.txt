Fall, Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Surgiseal closure of head laceration


History of Present Illness:
87yM with hx of COPD, dCHF, heart block s/p PPM, DM, and CKD who
presented after a fall at nursing home. Patient was found down
on bathroom floor with copious bleeding from head and staff
called EMS. Patient denied LOC.

Recently hospitalized at [**Location 1268**] VA when found fallen in
the stairwell after an OP appointment at the VA. Discharged 4
days prior to current presentation with diagnosis of pneumonia.

leukocytosis to 10.1, lactate to 2.4, Hct 28.5. SBP dropped to
80s which responded to 2L. Head CT, Abdomen/Pelvis CT, and FAST
negative for bleeding. Forehead laceration from fall bled
profusely and sealed with gel foam. On floor he received
ceftriaxone and flagyl for presumed pneumonia. Was then found to
be hypotensive to 80s despite numerous fluid boluses. Hct
dropped to 23.8.

Studies:
[**2112-4-1**] CXR
REASON FOR EXAM: Heart failure, received fluids.
Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day in
the morning.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Small bilateral
pleural effusions associated with adjacent atelectasis, left
greater than right, are minimally increased from prior. Pacer
leads remain in place, as is the right PICC. There is no
pulmonary edema.
.
[**2112-4-1**] R hand xray
FINDINGS: There is a comminuted fracture of the fifth proximal
phalanx.
.
[**2112-3-31**] Abd/pelvis CT
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
2. Stable 5.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm sac,
status post
endovascular repair.
3. Slightly increased small bilateral pleural effusions and
slight increased free fluid in the pelvis.
4. Cholelithiasis.
.
[**2112-3-31**] Transthoracic Echo
The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %) with mid to distal septal and distal
inferior hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. The
RV appears dilated with preserved systolic function.The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-8-19**],
regional LV systolic dysfunction is now present and the severity
of TR has increased.
.
[**2112-3-29**] CT Head
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Left frontal scalp laceration and subgaleal hematoma without
underlying
fracture.
3. Bilateral sinus disease with air-fluid levels may indicate
acute
sinusitis. Clinical correlation recommended.
.
[**2112-3-29**] CT spine
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture or malalignment.
2. Multilevel degenerative change with mild-to-moderate canal
narrowing at
C3-4 and C4-5 as above may predispose the patient to cord injury
in the
setting of trauma. If there is clinical concern for cord injury
and there is no contraindication, MRI is recommended for further
evaluation.
3. Unchanged mild compression deformity of C7.


Brief Hospital Course:
87 M with MMP, presents s/p fall and hypovolemia admitted to the
ICU for hypotension.
.
# Hypotension: Dropped to 80s in setting of elevated Cr, Lactate
and compressable IVC. After 2L of NS in ED his blood pressure
increased to the 110s.  [**Last Name (un) **] Stim was normal, so unlikely
adrenal insufficiency. No fever or leukocytosis so unlikely
sepsis/infection. TSH was normal so not hypothyroidism. Patient
had ECHO with worsening EF (45-50%) and LV systolic dysfunction
new since [**7-/2111**] so it was felt that his hypotension was likely
due to hypovolemia and poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
Acute MI was ruled out with CE flat x3 (though troponin 0.14
0.12 in setting of ARF)  He was not given any further fluid but
transfused 3 units of PRBCs.  His blood pressure meds were held
and he remained normotensive in the ICU.  Back on the floor his
pressures were stable but he was kept off of all
anti-hypertensives on discharge.
.
# Head laceration: Head lac not actively bleeding and surgiseal
was applied in the ED.  General surgery was consulted in the ICU
and said that no further intervention is needed.  The laceration
will heal and the surgiseal slough off.
.
# R 5th digit fracture - he was elgvaulated by hand surgery and
placed in a splint. Advised to keep RUE elevated. Has hand
clinic followup on [**2112-4-12**]. To continue PT and OT in rehab.
.
# Macrocytic Anemia: HCT 28
