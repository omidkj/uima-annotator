Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, bloody diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and extubation
central line placement and removal
arterial line placement and removal


History of Present Illness:
70M h/o ulcerative colitis, coronary disease s/p MI and CABG,
CVA, CRI, Afib on coumadin, recent diagnosis cirrhosis c/b
esophageal varices presents with 2 days decreased PO intake,
vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. Of note, he was recently d/c'd
from [**Hospital1 18**] [**2190-11-4**] after being admitted for 1 month of melena,
loose stools, and fatigue and found to have UC flare and
diagnosed with hepatic cirrhosis of unclear etiology (?PSC
planned for outpatient ERCP to evaluate). He was discharged on
hydrocortisone enemas and asacol for UC and ursodiol for ?PSC.

The patient is currently unable to answer many medical questions
due to altered mental status, although he can respond yes/no.
Per the family, he saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] [**2190-11-11**] and was doing well
except for diarrhea that was improving after Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] started
him on prednisone 50mg daily 2 days earlier with plans to taper
by 10mg qweek. He travelled to Montreal in [**Country 6607**] with his wife.
On [**11-17**] became more lethargic and confused and was admitted to
[**Hospital3 672**] hospital for encephalopathy that resolved with
lactulose. The family knows of no infectious source isolated. He
was discharged 1 week later off prednisone, asacol, or the
hydrocort enemas; family was told to give him lactulose prn and
therefore had not been giving many doses.

Post-discharge he was improved mentally but overall weak. For
the past two days, he has had decreased PO intake as well as
nausea and fatigue. The patient's daughter and wife also noticed
bloody diarrhea, characterized as loose brown stools with bright
red blood and some clots, up to 5 times per day which is at his
recent baseline. He was returning from [**Country 6607**] yesterday to be
seen by his hepatologist, Dr. [**Name (STitle) 23173**], and vomitied x1
(NBNB) and developed increased lethargy/confusion. Presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation.

In the ED, he was hypotensive to 80/60 that improved to SBP 90
with IVFs. Otherwise vitals were afebrile with RR 18-22 and
O2sats 98% RA. Labs notable for HCT stable at 38, INR 2.0,
normal WBC, Cre 3.9 (baseline 2.0), mild transaminitis, ammonia
109, lactate 3.9, AG 16. U/A negative. CXR not performed. Exam
without asterixis, distended abdomen but nontender, G+ brown
stool. Hepatology was consulted. He was given lactulose 30ml,
ciprofloxacin 400mg IV, and decadron 10mg IV. Admitted to ICU.

ROS: Per wife no fevers, chills, dysuria, abdominal pain. Only
recent complaint was mild low back pain. Patient denies pain but
otherwise unable to assess due to mental status. ?increased
abdominal distention per daughter. According to prior notes,
anorexia has been a problem for the patient over the past 2
months and there has been a reported [**11-29**] pound weight loss.

TTE [**2190-12-6**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated w
ith an apical left ventricular aneurysm. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral
walls and distal septum, anterior and apical walls. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 25-30 %). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(area 1.2 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
.
BLE US:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the right or
left lower
.
Chest CT [**2190-12-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral multifocal peri-bronchovascular consolidation,
likely due to
multifocal infection, or hemorrhage, very less likely pulmonary
edema.
2. Minimal bilateral pleural effusion.
3. Left pacemaker. Prior sternotomy for CABG. Cardiomegaly. Left

ventricular apical myocardial calcification, likely due to left
ventricular aneurysm.
4. Signs of anemia.
5. Enlargement of main pulmonary artery, suggesting pulmonary
hypertension.
6. Biliary sludge and gallstone, ascites, and signs of
cirrhosis. Dense
liver, could be due to repeated transfusions, less likely
hemochromatosis.
7. Aortic, aortic valvular and coronary artery calcifications.
8. Bilateral gynecomastia.


Brief Hospital Course:

70M h/o ulcerative colitis, coronary disease s/p MI and CABG,
CVA, CRI, Afib on coumadin, recent diagnosis cirrhosis c/b
esophageal varices presents with 2 days decreased PO intake,
vomiting, and bloody diarrhea admitted to ICU for hypotension
and ?GI bleed.

His altered mental status was felt to be due to hepatic
encephalopathy and improved on lactulose. His hypotension was
felt to be due to dehydration although infection was considered
and he was
