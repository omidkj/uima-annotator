Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfonamides / A.C.E Inhibitors / Protonix

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4365**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress, CHF exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M w CHF (EF 40%), CAD s/p CABG, CKD, DM2, CHB with
pacemaker who presents from his [**Hospital3 **] with increased
shortness of breath. His torsemide dose had recently been
increased from 10mg to 20mg daily over the weekend given weight
gain, poor urinary output and rales on exam per visiting
nursing. On [**10-9**] this dose was increased to 40mg daily,
however, without substantial benefit and pt was referred to ED
today for respiratory distress. According to his son, prior to
this time he had been doing well on the torsemide, however still
had very poor exercise tolerance and even the smallest task
(such as weighing himself) causes him to become dyspnea.
.
He has had multiple recents admissions for hypoxia and
respiratory distress secondary to CHF: [**Date range (1) 35209**], [**Date range (1) **]
(MICU stay), [**Date range (1) 35210**] (MICU stay/BiPAP). On discussions with
the patient and his family the decision was made to change his
code status to DNR/ but ok to intubate (for short time).
.
In ED, VS were T 97.1 HR 70 (paces ) 115/59, RR 32, O2 sat low
80s on 100% NRB. He was acutely SOB with increased work of
breathing and placed on BiPAP 10/5 (FiO2 100% - 40%). He had
some symptomatic improvement with this. His CXR was consistent
with pulmonary edema and given concern for possible underlying
pneumonia, he was treated with CTX and azithromycin in addition
to 100mg IV Lasix.
.
ROS: as above. Negative for fever, chills. +weight gain. +R hand
weakness (unchanged). + LE edema. No abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea or constipation

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with history of diastolic and
systolic CHF, CAD status post CABG, CKD, DM2 who presents with
respiratory distress likely secondary to CHF flare and pulmonary
edema initiated on BiPAP in the ED.
.
Plan:
# SOB/Dyspnea/Acute on chronic diastolic and systolic heart
failure: The patient presented with acute respiratory distress,
initially requiring bipap and ICU monitering.  He was initially
placed on a lasix drip, which was then converted to torsemide
30mg [**Hospital1 **], with stabilization of his respiratory status and
transfer to the regular medical floor.  On the medical floor,
his torsemide was weaned down to 20mg [**Hospital1 **], then to 20mg daily on
discharge to help with his rising kidney function, particularly
because his respiratory status remained stable.  He was also
started on valsartan 40mg daily to assist with afterload
reduction.  On discharge, he was breathing comfortabley on his
baseline 2 liters oxygen via nasal cannula, and will follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5717**] in clinic.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine has
been rising over past 6-8 months, which is attributed to his
poor forward flow from his congestive heart failure and
recurrent diuretic use with exacerbations.  His new baseline on
admission was 2.8-3.4, and patient had acute renal failure with
rise in his creatnine to 4.2 at time of discharge.  Renal
consult was obtained and his acute renal failure was attributed
to his diuretic use and addition of valsartan, although no
change in management was made as he required these medications
for his congestive heart failure.  He was started on sevelamer
TID with meals, and was discharged to start taking procrit
10,000 units every other week and iron supplements for his
kidney-disease related anemia.  It is unclear if he will
tolerate the procrit with his congestive heart failure.
Although his creatnine was still rising at time of discharge,
per discussion with the patient's primary care physician and the
nephrologists, we felt comfortable discharging him on a lower
dose of torsemide, 20mg daily, to be increased to [**Hospital1 **] as needed
for volume overload.  His electrolytes and creatnine will be
monitered by home nursing on discharge, and he will follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5717**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4090**] (from nephrology) in clinic.
.

# CAD status post remote CABG: The patient was maintained on his
outpatient aspirin, beta blocker.
.
# Anemia: The patient's recent baseline Hct has been approx 25.
His anemia is attributed to his renal failure and he was
discharged on iron supplements, and procrit if tolerated.
.
# BPH: Continued Flomax
.
# Diabetes mellitus type II: Held glipizide and treatd with
humalog ISS, restarted glipizide on discharge.
