Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsiveness and left-sided weakness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG tube insertion [**2199-5-17**]


History of Present Illness:
79RHF with paroxysmal atrial flutter/AF previously well
controlled on sotalol and on dabigatran for anticoagulation,
CAD,
mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, diastolic CHF, HTN, HLD,
CKD presents with unresponsiveness and left-sided weakness.

Patient was apparently at her usual state of health other than
feeling tired when her son spoke to her on the phone at 8pm on
[**5-3**]. No-one sw her in the interim on [**5-4**] and on [**5-5**] a son saw
her in bed at 10am, asked if she was ok and she did not respond
but he did not think much of it and attributed this to her being
tired. However, when her other son came to check on her at 19:00
today ([**5-5**]), he found her to be unresponsive, had been
incontinent of urine and had her right leg hanging onto the
floor
and the other leg in bed. Son gave her a small amount of water
and apparently managed this as she was motioning that she wanted
water and appeared dry. She was not moving her left side and was
very drowsy and not talking. EMS were called and she was noted
to
be in fast Aflutter in 150s and in the ambulance they
administered IV diltiazem which brought her HR to the low 100s.
BP was stable throughout and on arrival at the [**Hospital1 18**] ED BP was
120s-130s/70s and she had been incontinent of stool. There was
initial concern regarding whether she would need to be intubated
as she was obtunded and not opening her eyes. Her respiratory
status remained stable save requirement for suctioning and sats
maintained at 100s and RR ranged from 20s when unstimulated to
30s when stimulated. She had clear left hemiparesis and right
gaze deviation.

Patient does not feel in pain or shortness of breath but more
expanded ROS not possible due to difficulties communicating and
conscious level. Patient is oriented partially and does not
appear to be aphasic but is very dysarthric. Patient had
persistent tachycardia and had a further 10mg IV diltiazem prior
to transfer to the ICU. Patient thirsty and saying she wants
water.

Past Medical History:
PMH:
- Paroxysmal atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation previously well
controlled on sotalol and on dabigatran for anticoagulation s/p
failed TEE cardioversion [**3-/2198**]
