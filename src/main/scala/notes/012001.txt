Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Lisinopril / Celexa

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
34F, G3P1 8 days s/p C-section ([**2117-12-24**]) at 35 weeks gestation
for fetal distress/non-reassuring heart rate after induction for
oligohydramnios and low biophysical profile, now transfer from
OSH ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
.
Her pregnancy has been complicated by chronic type II DM,
hypertension, and asthma. [**Last Name (un) **] has followed her for DM. No
significant proteinuria. Patient was seen as an outpatient on
[**2117-12-22**] for followup. BPP was [**3-17**] and oligohydramnios was seen.
She was admitted for induction of labor. Received Cytotec and
Pitocin. She progressed slowly and had variable decelerations.
Had combined spinal-epidural for anesthesia. Csection was
uncomplicated. Baby went to NICU afterwards given prematurity.
Placenta was intact.
.
She was discharged home on [**2117-12-27**]. Post op/incision check on
[**12-29**]; BP at that time 168/88. Per notes she was short of breath
at her rest home x 2 days. Initially with walking and then with
rest as well. Also noted cough, unclear if productive. No
wheezing, fevers, chills, sick contacts. Reported increasing LE
edema. Reported pleuritic CP in ED. Per report she was sent for
an outpatient study (VQ or CTA; unclear who ordered this). She
was unable to lay flat and thus test cancelled. After she left
she developed worsening respiratory distress and went to the ED.
Had bilateral infiltrates on CXR. BNP 111. CTA did not show PE
but was somewhat poor study. Given solumedrol, ceftriaxone,
azithromycin. Flu swab was sent and was negative. She went to
the unit for respiratory distress for NIPPV. Bronch/BAL
performed, showed friable mucosa, no endobronchial lesions,
secretions or mucus. After bronch she developed worsening
respiratory distress. Plan was made to intubate. She was a
difficult intubation and required intubation over flex
bronchoscope. Also developed fever to 103. Antibiotics changed
to vanco, zosyn, and cipro. Sedation increased. Relative
hypotension to 90s. Given 2 L NS. Paralyzed with cisatra. After
paralysis was able to come down on FiO2 to 0.7 (peep still 15).
Decision was made for transport to [**Hospital1 18**] at that point.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient sedated but moving all extremities.
O2 sats 80% on arrival on 100% FiO2 and PEEP 15. Minimal
activity causing desats, but difficult to get O2 sats > 90%.

Brief Hospital Course:
34F with asthma, DM, HTN, G3P1 POD#8 from C-section, presenting
with hypoxemic respiratory failure.

# Hypoxic respiratory failure. With low P:F ratio, bilateral
infiltrates, and presumably normal L sided pressures (based on
today's OSH echo), patient met criteria for ARDS. She was
treated with vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxacin for possible
hospital acquired pnemonia.  She was treated with acyclovir for
possible varicella pneumonia.  She was initially treated with
oseltamivir for possible influenza, and treated was stopped once
her respiratory viral screen was negative. Myocardial infarction
was ruled out by electrocardiogram and serial serum biomarkers.
She was gradually weaned from the ventilator and extubated on
[**2118-1-4**].  She defervesced and all anti infective agents were
stopped.  Once on the floor, the patient had a normal pulmonary
exam, and required no supplemental oxygen.  A echocardiogram
demonstrated normal ejection fraction.  Given her rapid
recovery, it was suspected that hypertension may have
precipitated flash pulmonary edema, especially given her
relatively fluid overloaded state postpartum.

#. s/p c-section.  On hospital day two, fluid drained from her
c-section incision.  OB/GYN was consulted, and opend the
incision at the bedside.  A seroma was drained, but the fascial
closure was intact, and the was no sign of infection.  The wound
culture was sent for culture and was negative. A pelvic
ultrasound showed no evidence of retained products of
conception.  Dressing changes were performed twice daily.  Wond
care recommended a wound vac, but placement was not feasible
secondary to her pannus.

#. Blood Pressure.  On admission, patient's systolic blood
pressure was 100-110, which was lower than her baseline and
there was concern for sepsis.  Her blood pressure gradually
trended up to 200/100 by arterial line.  She was treated with IV
labetalol and hydralazine. She last was started on a labetolol
drip.  Her blood pressure then decreased to SBP of 80s and she
was given 1.5L NS bolus and her blood pressure increased to a
SBP of 120s.  He blood pressure stabilized and she was started
on chlorthalidone 25 mg PO daily, and labetalol 200mg PO qid.
.
# Fever, leukocytosis. At OSH, patient was noted to be febrile
to 103.0.  Hereher tempterature peaked at 102.5 on [**2118-1-2**]. She
was treated with antibiotics as noted above.  Blood, urine,
sputum, respiratory and wound cultures were all negative. On
[**2118-1-3**] she defervesced.  All antibiotics were stopped as the
patient's repiratory status improved.
.
# DM type II. Patient was covered with a humalog sliding scale.
On discharge she was restarted on her home dose of insulin NPH
15 units [**Hospital1 **], with 8 units of humalog tid with meals.
.
# Asthma. Patient was treated with nebulizers as needed.  She
with her home albuterol inhaler.
.
# Code: Full
