FINDINGS: There is a type III dense fracture which extends
through the body of C2 into the right lateral mass. There is a
fracture line that extends into the foramen transverse sarium on
the right side. The fracture fragments are minimally displaced.
There is no retropulsion into the cervical spinal canal. There
are prominent degenerative changes in the mid cervical spine
with degenerative disk disease of C3-C7. There is also prominent
facet arthropathy at these levels as well. There is high
attenuation in epidural space spanning from C1-C3. This
abormality is consistent with a small epidural hematoma. There
is CSF attenuation remaining surrounding the cervical spinal
cord.
There is pronounced arterial vascular calcification and
bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:
1. Type III dens fracture with extent into the lateral mass of
C2 and involves the right foramen transverse sarium. There is a
small epidural hematoma spanning from C1-C3.
2. Diffuse spondylytic changes in the mid to lower cervical
spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Nondisplaced fracture through the anterior superior end plate
of T2 and nondisplaced fracture of the left 8th rib.
2. No evidence of compression of the spinal cord in the thoracic
spine.

IMPRESSION:
1) Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. There is no
intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation identified. However, the
distal common bile duct and pancreas were not visualized due to
overlying bowel gas.
2) Small septated cyst and small granuloma in the left lobe of
the liver.
3) Small amount of fluid in the abdomen seen above the liver
dome.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2183-10-30**] transferred from an OSH with
the fractures described above. He was admitted to the trauma
SICU for stabilization and close monitoring. His CT head was
negative for acute intercranial injury. He received FFP and
vitamin K for his elevated INR (2.6). His scalp laceration was
repaired with staples. He remained hemodynamically and
neurologically stable in the SICU, and developed no new
neurologic deficits. His motor and sensory exam was normal and
remained so throughout his hospitalization.
On HD4 he was transferred to the floor. On the floor, he had
some episodes of agitation, mostly at night, that required
haloperidol prn. On HD6 he was found to be dyspneic with
decreased O2 sats to the low 90s. His chest xray showed slight
fluid overload. He was given lasix 20, and nebulizer treatments,
with an improvement in his respiratory status, to O2 sats in the
high 90s.
On HD7, he failed a swallow test, and on HD8 a PICC line was
placed to provide nutrition via TPN.
On HD8, he was found to be slightly jaundiced, and LFTs revealed
a hyperbilirubinemia (50% direct, 50% indirect). Liver fellow
was consulted. RUQ ultrasound showed cholelithiasis with no
evidence of cholecystitis, normal ducts. He was started on
ursodiol 300.
On HD10 he self d/c'd his PICC line. Re-evaluation by the
swallow consult showed that he passed for soft solids and
thickened liquids. He was restarted on PO feedings with
assistance.
Throughout his stay on the floor, he had occasional tachycardia
to the 140s, while in afib. these were treated with additional
doses of IV metoprolol. He had no such tachycardia the 2 days
prior to discharge, and required no additional beta-blocker.
On HD12 he was started on PO medications which he tolerated
well.
He was seen by PT/OT, which will be continued upon discharge.
He was transferred to rehab on HD 13 with follow-up with
neurosurgery, and a c-collar to stay on for 12 weeks.
