54 y/o M with PMH of IDDM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p R AKA and L 2nd
and 3rd finger amputation, transferred from [**Doctor First Name 8125**] ER for fever
and pus from HD catheter. His symptoms began the day of
admission when he developed altered mental status while at home.
Family reports he was doing pretty well at home, able to attend
a wedding two days prior to admission. They then noted he became
more confused, fell at home and hit his head on the television.
Denied LOC. He was unable to recognize family members and the
brought him to an OSH ED. He was also noted to have purulence
draining from his tunneled RIJ HD line two days prior to
admission at HD. At OSH ED, his T 103.2 BP stable at
105-176/50-89. He was given 1g Vancomycin and 1gm Ceftriaxone
X1. CT Head negative for bleed. Old R cerebellar infarct noted.
Blood cultures were sent from HD line and he was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 102.8 P 104 BP 106/53 O2 sat 100%
2L NC. Exam significant for obtundation. Labs revealed elevated
WBC count to 25 (93%PMN, no bands) and a normal lactate of 1.4.
CXR showed cardiomegaly with HD line in place and right hilar
fullness without obvious infiltrate. EKG showed 1 AVB, TWI
inferiorly, unchanged from prior. A CT abdomen/pelvis was
performed to evaluate for etiology of leukocytosis and showed a
question of spigelian hernia with small bowel, portion of
appendix and cecal tip
within it. No obstruction or signs of surrounding inflammation.
Surgery consult was obtained and felt hernia not likely cause of
infection. Repeat blood cultures were drawn, and he was given
zosyn in addition to his previous antibiotics. Transplant team
was made aware of catheter. Pt also evaluaed by nephrology team,
felt urgent HD not needed and recommended pulling HD line. Pt
received 1L NS and was admitted to the MICU for further care.

Brief Hospital Course:
54y/o M with PMH of ESRD on HD and PVD admitted with line
sepsis, now s/p removal of tunneled HD catheter.

# Line Sepsis: Tunneled line was removed [**9-6**] and had frank
pus.  Blood Cx from [**Hospital 8125**] hospital growing MRSA.  Initial blood
cx grew MRSA. He remained hemodynamically stable. Other source
of fever could potentially be gangrene in left hand although per
vascular does not appear infected. On Vancomycin, dosing by
levels and with HD although no HD yet while in MICU. He did not
have sepsis physiology and did not require pressors. He had 48
hour line holiday from [**9-7**] at 11am until [**9-9**].  TTE was
negative but since he had positive  cultures on [**2191-9-4**] we
performed a TEE, which showed mitral valve endocarditis.
Vancomycin course will be 6 week course on these grownds. Start
date [**2189-9-9**]. Cultures were NGTD on [**11-16**], and [**9-9**]. he
will need to have vanc levels checked and dosing at HD (M, W, F)

# Altered mental status: AMS most likley multifactorial. CT head
neg for bleed at OSH. MS improved with abx and holding sedating
meds. Oriented x 3 at time of transfer. on the floor he
continued to do well on this regard.

# PVD/CAD: Continued on plavix, statin and ASA. Vascular surgery
consulted and did not believe amputated digits were infected or
were cause of bacteremia. Plain films of hand were c/w possible
osteo L 4th digit. Vascular did not think that this was osteo as
pt did not have any symptoms.  L 4th digit was noticeable for
dry gangrene on physical exam pt pt did not want another
amputation.

# ESRD on HD: Renal following. After the line [**Last Name (un) **] (48 hrs)
pt had a new tunneled line placed controlateral to the infected
site. HD was started subsequently with decrease in Cre.
