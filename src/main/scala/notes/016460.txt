cm squared with a peak gradient of 40 mmHg and LVEDP of 22,

stenosis, and diffuse plaque in the LAD.  The patient was
referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an aortic valve replacement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2197-5-24**], one day prior to going
to the Operating Room for hemodynamic optimization.  The
patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2197-5-25**] with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve.  Please see the
operative note for full details.  Total cardiopulmonary
bypass time was 120 minutes, cross clamp time 81 minutes.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition.

At the end of the operation, the patient developed atrial
arrhythmias.  The patient was started on an Amiodarone drip.
The patient required low-dose Levophed for maintaining
adequate systolic blood pressure.  The patient's hematic
indices were good with good cardiac output.  The patient was
weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on his first
postoperative day.  The patient's pulmonary artery catheter
was removed on postoperative day number one.  On
postoperative day number two, the patient was found to have a
platelet count in the 70s.  Heparin antibody was sent which
was subsequently negative.  The patient was started on
Lopressor and continued on Amiodarone.  The patient's
hematocrit was 24.  The patient was transfused 1 unit of
packed red blood cells.

The evening of postoperative day number two and postoperative
day number three, the patient developed atrial fibrillation.
The patient was given additional IV Lopressor and he
converted to sinus rhythm.  The patient continued on his
Lasix and Lopressor, remained in sinus rhythm, started on a
heparin drip for anticoagulation.  [**Last Name (un) **] consulted on the
patient due to his diabetes, recommended continuing the
patient's Lantus.

On postoperative day number four, the patient was transferred
from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular part of the
hospital where he began working with Physical Therapy.  The
patient's epicardial pacing wires were removed without
incident.  The patient was started on Coumadin.  By
postoperative day number six, the patient was able to
ambulate 500 feet and climb one flight of stairs with
Physical Therapy.  Also, on postoperative day number six, in
the early morning, the patient's left peripheral IV which the
heparin infusion had been going had infiltrated.  The patient
was found to have an edematous arm.  The IV was removed and
the arm was elevated at that time.  The patient had normal
capillary refill with normal sensory and motor function, Over
the course of the day, the edema decreased.  The arm became
ecchymotic.  The heparin drip was discontinued.

By postoperative day number seven, the patient was cleared
for discharge to home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The temperature max was 98.8, pulse
80, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 109/41, respiratory rate 16,
room air, oxygen saturation 97 percent.  The laboratory data
revealed a white blood cell count 7.1, hematocrit 26.7,
platelet count 226,000, potassium 4.5, BUN 18, creatinine
1.1.  The patient's weight on [**2197-6-1**] was 112 kilograms.
The patient was 107 kilograms preoperatively.
Neurologically, the patient was awake, alert, and oriented

pitting edema.  The left upper extremity from the midforearm
to the midupper arm was ecchymotic in the medial and
posterior portion with three small blisters in the medial
portion of the arm.  The capillary refill was less than two
seconds.  The strength was equal to the right side and
sensation was intact.  The patient denied any pain.  There
was no warmth.

   checked on [**2197-6-2**] by the visiting nurse and the results
   will be called to the patient's cardiologist, Dr.[**Name (NI) 56122**],
   office with further INR checks and Coumadin dosing per Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **].
12.      Lantus and Humalog insulin per the sliding scale.


DISPOSITION:  The patient is to be discharged to home in
stable condition.

2. Status post aortic valve replacement.
3. Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
4. Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
