History of Present Illness:
80 year old female with PVD, bilateral carotid dz s/p bilateral

Pertinent Results:
Cath Results:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Mild single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
4. Severely elevated central aortic pressure.
5. Severe distal aortic disease.
6. Severe right external iliac disease.
7. Successful distal aortic reconstruction with stenting of the
origins
of the common iliac arteries bilaterally.
8. Successful stenting of the right external iliac artery.
COMMENTS:
1. Hemodynamic evaluation revealed mildly elevated right-sided
pressures (mean RA was 8 and RVEDP was 13 mmHg), moderate to
severely
elevated left sided pressures (mean PCW was 22 and LVEDP was 23
mmHg),
severely elevated pulmonary pressures (PA was 79/27 mmHg and the
PVR was
516 dynes-sec/cm-5), and a severely elevated central aortic
pressure
(264/103 mmHg) with a severely elevated systemic [**Year (4 digits) 1106**]
resistance
(4077 dynes-sec/cm-5). The cardiac index was borderline low at
2.0
L/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen consumption). There was no
gradient
across the aortic valve on pullback of the angled pigtail
catheter from
the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
2. Selective coronary arteriography revealed single vessel
disease.
The LMCA was calcified and had an ostial 30% stenosis. The LAD
was
calcified and had a 50% stenosis distally. The LCX was calcified
and
had mild luminal irregularities. The RCA was calcified and had
mild
luminal irregularities.
3. Abdominal aortography revealed severe diffuse disease with
evidence
of prior aortic reconstruction. The right renal artery was
single
without critical lesions. The left renal artery was also single
and
arose from the repaired segment of the abdominal aorta, it was
also
without critical lesions. The distal aorta had severe disease
extending
into the iliac arteries bilaterally.
4. Right lower extremity angiography revealed a 90% stenosis at
the
origin of the CIA with diffuse disease extending into the EIA
which also
had a 90% stenosis. The IIA was occluded. The CFA, SFA,
popliteal, AT,
PT, and PA were all without critical lesions.
5. Left lower extremity angiography revealed an 80% stenosis at
the
origin of the CIA wihtout critical lesions distally. The IIA was
patent
with an ostial stenosis. The CFA and proximal SFA were free of
angiographically significant disease.
6. Successful reconstruction of the distal aorta with
simultaneous
placement of a 7.0 x 58 mm Omnilink stent in the distal aorta
extending
into the right common iliac artery and a 7.0 x 38 mm Omnilink
stent
in the distal aorta extending into the left common iliac artery.
Both
stents were postdilated to 8.0 mm. Final angiography revealed no
residual stenosis, normal flow, and no demonstrable gradient
across
either iliac artery.
7. Successful stenting of the distal right common iliac artery
into the
right external iliac artery with an 8.0 x 56 mm Dynalink stent.
Final
angiograohy revealed no residual stenosi, no apparent
dissection, and
normal flow (see PTA comments).

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old female with bilateral carotid disease s/p bilateral
CEA's and [**Country **] stenting, htn, dyslipidemia, admitted for
elective cardiac cath.

1.  Hypertensive urgency/emergency:  Pt was admitted for
elective cardiac cath to evaluate coronaries as a potential
cause of recurrent pulmonary edema.  On day of admission, noted
to have BP 210's/100's without evidence of end-organ damage
(chest pain, ecg changes, HA, visual changes, back pain or
hematuria).  Given PO meds with improvement of BP to 140's/90's.
 During cath, found again to be hypertensive to 264/103, so
admitted to CCU.  There she was noted to be hallucinating,
likely [**2-26**] hypertensive encephalopathy.  Started on nipride drip
then transitioned back to stable outpt antihypertensive regimen.
 Currently BP stable around 140's/80's.  Will continue outpt
regimen of quinapril and nadolol.

2.  Elective Cardiac Cath:  Found to have 30% LMCA dz and 50%
distal LAD disease, with no intervention done to coronaries.
However, she was noted to have severe dz at both common iliacs
(90 and 80% stenoses or R & L), and 90% stenosis of right
external iliac artery, each of which were stented with BMS's.
Aspirin and ticlopidine (given plavix allergy) will be used for
life.

3.  CHF: Pt had depressed CO and increased left sided and
pulmonary pressures.  Etiology likely malignant hypertension
causing increased afterload, decreased cardiac output causing
increased L-sided filling pressures being transmitted to the
pulmonary vasculature.  Also, the pt was anemic 2/2 blood loss
from right groin during cath, so 1U PRBC given.  These 2
manuvers improved the pt's volume overloaded state.  She
required lasix IV X 2 and will be d/c'd on outpt dose of oral
lasix.

4.  Hx Left Subclavian Arterial Stenosis:  Noted during prior
catheterizations.  She does have occasional symptoms of
tingling, but her symptoms did not warrant intervention.  She
does not have steal syndrome and is not at risk of
limb-threatening ischemia.  If the pt were to need
LIMA-->coronary, her subclavian would then have needed to be
stented.

5.  Anemia:  [**2-26**] excessive blood loss from right groin during
cath and epistaxis from nasal canula.  Was transfused one unit
PRBC and is being discharged with stable hematocrit.

6.  PNA:  Pt with LLL infiltrate on CXR.  Afebrile, no
leukocytosis and no breathing problems.  [**Name (NI) **] be d/c'd on
levaquin to finish a 7 day course.
