Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Right and left central lines
Three arterial lines

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 17492**] is a 40 year-old female with a history of cirrhosis
secondary to hepatitis C with a possible contribution by
previous alcohol use and complicated by varices, COPD who
presented to an OSH ED with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and
question of melena (occured 1-2 weeks ago).

She was seen at the same OSH ED prior and felt to have mild
ileitis and discharged. Per hepatology note, she was having 3
weeks of diffuse abdominal pain which became acutely worse over
past two days. She noted a weight gain and loss of apetite.
Denied BRBPR, no hematemsis. Symptoms have been going on for
weeks to months although unclear per records. She also noted
left breast pain for 3 weeks. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] ED
for further care.

In the ED she was noted to be tachypnic. Her initial vitals were
99.6, 126, 111/47, 17-23, 99% 6L (83% RA). She was markedly
tachypnic, worse when lying down. A rash was noticed on her
abdomen and chest (including left breast) and thighs. She was
given vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl for broad coverage
(cellulitis, ascities, pneumonia, colitis).  She was noted to be
wheezy and was treated for a COPD exacerbation with steroids and
nebs.  Her respiratory status did not improve and she was
sedated and intubated to protect her airway.  CTA did not reveal
a PE.  After intubation her blood pressure dropped.  She was
started on phenylephrine and propofol and fentanyl.  A right IJ
was attempted but went into the axillary vein and a left IJ was
placed.  She was seen by transplant surgery who was not
concerned about her rash for a necrotizing fascitiis.  She was
admitted to the MICU for further care.  Further history was not
possible owing to sedation.

Review of systems:
Per Hepatology note (interview in ED prior to sedation and
intubation):
Positive for headache. No fever, no dizziness, no CP, no SOB, no
cough, no dysuria, no urgency, she had not noted the rash that
was obvious on physical exam. No muscle-joint pain, no numbness.
She had coarse voice for the past 4 months that has been
evaluated by ENT who recommend maxiam anti-reflux treatment and
videostroboscopy exam.

Past Medical History:
1. Seizure disorder
2. Cellulitis
3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), shown not to
have alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency.
4. Depression
5. DM Type 2 (per patient)
6. Smoking
7. Hepatitis C cirrhosis with type 1b
8. Esophageal varices

Social History:
Lives in [**Location 2251**] with roomates. On disability.
Tobacco: Smokes 1 pack every four days for past two years.
Formerly, smoked 1 pack/day since childhood.
EtOH: Former heavy drinker, denies current use.
Drugs: former IVDU (heroin), denies current use.


Family History:
Sister with COPD - is about 15 years older. Father - liver
failure [**1-24**] EtOH. Sister - liver failure [**1-24**] chronic hepatitis.

Physical Exam:
General: Intubated, sedated, withdraws to pain - GCS 5 with
sedation.
HEENT: Sclera mildly icteric, intubated.
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD.
Lungs: decreased lung sounds on right.  Left with rhochi and
occasional wheeze
CV: tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops
Abdomen:  Obese, distended, moderatly tense, +bowels sounds
GU: Foley catheter in place.
Ext: anasarca.
Skin: Rash on LLQ, multiple confluescent white 5-10mm papules on
an erythematous base, which are non blanching.  Diffuse
petechial rash on chest, non blanching.  Chronic venous stasus
changes on lower extremities b/l. Numerous tattoos with baudy
themes.
