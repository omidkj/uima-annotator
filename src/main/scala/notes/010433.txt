Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased lower extremity edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tunneled catheter placement
Hemodialysis x 3 sessions


History of Present Illness:
This is a 44 yo F h/o DMI, CKD, HTN who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED with anasarca, worsening LE swelling, malaise,fatigue and RUQ
abdominal pain. In the ED she was found to be hypertensive with
SBPs in the 200's. A nitro gtt was initiated and BP was reduced
quickly to 140, which resulted in patient experiencing
lightheadedness. Patient also found to have a Cr of 9.3, her
last OMR value was 3 in [**6-22**]. Patient received IV lasix in the
ED and was seen by renal who felt she would likely require
initiation of dialysis. Patient was admitted to the MICU for
management of her hypertension.

In the MICU, patient was weaned off her nitro gtt and restarted
on her outpatient regimen of labetolol and amlodipine. She was
also continued on IV lasix for diuresis goal of one to two
liters given her volume overload. She was followed by the renal
team who suggested tunnelled line for HD on Mon and lab
testing/vein mapping in anticipation of fistula placement.

At time of transfer to floor, patient had no complaints.

ECG [**2135-4-15**]:
Sinus rhythm. Poor R wave progression which is non-diagnostic.
Diffuse T wave changes which are non-specific. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2133-11-19**] no significant diagnostic change.

CXR [**2135-4-15**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

RENAL U/S [**2135-4-16**]:
1. Bilateral echogenic kidneys, similar in appearance.
2. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
3. Small amount of fluid between liver and right kidney and
spleen and left
kidney.

Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2135-4-18**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 44 year old female with history of DM1, CKD, HTN who
now presents with lower extremity edema and was found to have
significantly worsened renal function requiring initiation of
HD. Patient initially admitted to the medical ICU given
hypertension on admission and was then transferred to floor
medical service.

#. End Stage Renal Disease: On admission Cr noted to be 9.8 up
from 3 ([**5-23**]). Thi was felt to be advanced chronic kidney
disease rather than due to an acute process. Patient followed by
the renal consult team who recommended tunneled line placement
for initiation of dialysis. Patient tolerated her first three
dialysis sessions without any complications. She underwent
ultrasound vein mapping in anticipation of fistula surgery.
Patient seen by dialysis social worker who helped coordinate
outpatient dialysis. Patient discharged with prescriptions for
nephrocaps and sevelamer carbonate
.
#. HTN: In the emergency department patient found to be
hypertensive with SBPs to the 200's. She was started on a
nitroglycerin gtt and admitted to the MICU for management of her
hypertension. Nitro gtt was titrated off and patient was
restarted on her outpatient regimen of amlodipine and labetolol.
Patient had no further episodes of hypertension during this
hospital course. Prior to discharge she was started on
lisinopril 5 mg daily and amlodipine was reduced to 5mg daily
from 10 mg daily. She also remains on labetolol 300 mg daily.

# Volume overload: Prior to admission patient noticed increasing
lower extremity edema. On admission she did not have any
evidence of pulmonary edema or elevated jugular venous pressure.
Lower extremity edema improved slightly with intravenous lasix
and patient felt more comfortable ambulating prior to discharge.
Notably, a transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild LVH, severe
pulm HTN and 2+ mitral regurgitation.

# Pulmonary Hypertension: ECHO demonstrated severe pulmonary
hypertension. There were no studies for comparison. The etiology
of PH is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 227**] the patient does not have significant
left heart disease would suggest further work-up such as PFTs
and polysomnography. [**Month (only) 116**] also want to recheck ECHO within the
next fews weeks to assess whether improved hemodynamics in
setting of HD initiation has an effect.

#. Diabetes, type 1: Blood sugars remain well controlled.
Patient scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3617**] at [**Last Name (un) **].

#. Hyperlipidemia: Patient continued on simvastatin.

#. Anemia: Hematocrit slowly trended down over hospital course.
This was felt to be secondary to chronic kidney disease. Patient
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells prior to discharge.
She was also started on epogen and intravenous iron with HD.
