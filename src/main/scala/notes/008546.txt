catheter inserted via the left internal jugular vein and
projecting with its tip against the lateral wall of the superior
vena cava. The lung volumes are low, there is a small
retrocardiac atelectasis, but no evidence of focal parenchymal
opacity suggestive of pneumonia. No evidence of overhydration.

on previous culture data.  The patient remained afebrile and
blood pressures remained stable.  Blood cultures show no growth
to date.  Stool cultures sent and also show no growth to date.
C.diff was negative.  Urine culture showed yeast and foley was

bactermias and resistant organisms.  Linezolid and Meropenem
were continued for two days and then [**Known lastname 8910**] as no source
