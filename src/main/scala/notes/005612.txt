ECHO [**2175-1-6**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is asymmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a moderate resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Asymmetric LVH with hyperdynamic systolic function,
c/w hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Moderate resting LVOT
obstruction. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

CXR [**2175-1-11**] (PORTABLE): In comparison with the study of [**2173-10-8**],
there has been substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
with relatively mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
This discordancy raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy, with
pericardial effusion being less likely. There is increased
prominence of the superior mediastinum. It is difficult to
determine whether this represents a manifestation of vascular
congestion or merely a reflection of the size of the patient and
the AP portable technique. The ICD leads extend to the right
atrium and apex of the right ventricle.

CXR [**2175-1-12**] (PA/LAT): Pacemaker leads are in standard position
with tips in the right atrium and right ventricle. There is mild
cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There is mild vascular congestion.

ECHO [**2175-1-17**]: There is left ventricular hypertrophy with
prominent interventricular septum (at least 30 mm thick at its
base). (Parasternal views not obtained for standard wall
thickness measurements.

On baseline imaging, a resting left ventricular outflow gradient
of at least 26 mmHg was recorded. However the baseline survey
was limited, so this is likely an underestimate of the baseline
gradient.

With injections of Optison into the first septal perforator ,
there was enhancement of the basal septum including the most
prominent portion of the left ventricular outflow obstruction at
point of contact with the tip of the anterior mitral leaflet.

Enhancement of the same basal septal region was noted following
ethanol injection into the septal perforator (3 injections total
of 1cc each). The basal septum appeared enhanced and hypokinetic
following these injections and there was no signfiicant residual
left ventricular outflow gradient recorded (peak left
ventricular outflow velocity of 1 m/s).

Cardiac Cath [**2175-1-17**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Successful ethanol septal ablation of a large septal artery
with
complete resolution of the resting gradient across the left
ventricular
outflow tract (35 mm Hg --> 0 mm Hg).
2. Insignificant CAD (40% stenosis in the ramus)
3. Successful deployment of a 6 fr Angioseal closure device to
the
right common femoral artery.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal except for  a 40% stenosis in
the ramus
intermedius.
2. Successful ethanol septal ablation of a large septal branch
with abolition of gradient across the left ventricular outflow
tract.
3. Aspirin to continue indefinitely.
4. Hypertension control.
5. Continue verapamil and carvedilol. Incrwease carvedilol to 25
mg PO
BID.
6. CCU observation.

Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUE:
[ ] On cardiac cath, she was found to have normal coronary
arteries except for a 40% stenosis in the ramus intermedius.
Indefinite aspirin is recommended.
