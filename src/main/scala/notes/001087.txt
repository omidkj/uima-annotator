.
ECHO - [**2-16**] - The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal(LVEF 70%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with severe hypokinesis and
relative preservation of apical function c/w large pulmonary
embolism ([**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign). Mild to moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. There is mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension
(UNDERestimated based on TR jet velocity as RA pressures are
likely greater than 15-20 mm Hg). Normal regional and global
left ventricular systolic function.
.
LENI Bilateral LEs [**2-16**] -
1. Deep vein thrombosis: Occlusive thrombus demonstrated in the
left
popliteal vein extending to the left calf veins.
2. Occlusive thrombus in the left greater saphenous vein
extending to its'
junction with the common femoral vein.
3. Left [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.
No DVT of the left upper extremity.
.
LENI LUE [**2-16**] -
No DVT of the left upper extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo woman wtih bipolar disorder, hypertension, and recent
humeral fracture who presented with shortness of breath to
outside hospital, found to have saddle pulmonary embolus on CTA,
now s/p IVC filter placement and discharged on coumadin.
.
Hospital course by problem:
.
# Pulmonary embolism: The etiology of the patient's PE is
unclear though it is expected to be partially due to recent
fracture and possible decreased mobility.  Source was a large
left lower extremity DVT.  Hemodynamic instability at the
outside hospital that resolved with fluids was presumably due to
preload dependency due to right heart strain.  This was further
reenforced by formal echocardiogam here that showed severe right
ventricle hypokinesis.  Nevertheless, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable after transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  She had an IVC
filter placed given concern for further embolic events.  She was
maintained on heparin and transitioned to coumadin on the night
of [**2175-2-17**]. She became therapeutic on coumadin and was
discharged with VNA follow up of INR.
.
# Left humerus fracture: This was sustained on [**2-6**]. She was
maintained in her previously placed brace and followed by
orthopedics. She was discharged with follow up appointments with
orthopedic surgery.
.
# Leukocytosis: This was noted upon admission to ED and the
patient had a left shift.   Nevertheless, she was afebrile with
a negative UA and this was considered possibly just due to
stress in context of large PE.  She ws monitored and her
leukocytosis resolved. She then developed a new leukocytosis and
was noted to have a UTI on UA and was discharged on antibiotics
for the UTI.
.
# Anemia: Patient had normocytic anemia, newly developed since
last admission. HCT 32 at OSH ED. Could possibly be marrow
suppression due to inflammatory state s/p fracture, but also on
heparin gtt. No h/o GIB. Guaiac negative at OSH prior to Heparin
gtt start. The pt was discharged with plans for outpatient
follow up of her anemia.
.
# Nongap metabolic acidosis: Present on presentation probably
due to compensatory tachypnea and respiratory acidosis. No
history of diarrhea or other increased bicarbonate losses.  This
resolved over the course of her hospitalization.
.
# Bipolar disorder / Anxiety: The patient was stable on her home
psychiatric meds (lithium and trifluoperazine. )
.
# Hypertension: The patient was initially hypotensive on her
presentation to the outside hospital.  Nevertheless she became
hypertensive here and was eventually started back on her home
anti-hypertensive regim
