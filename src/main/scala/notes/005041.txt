25-OHD3 INDICATES BOTH ENDOGENOUS PRODUCTION AND
SUPPLEMENTATION. 25-OHD2 IS AN INDICATOR OF
EXOGENOUS SOURCES SUCH AS DIET OR SUPPLEMENTATION.
THERAPY IS BASED ON MEASUREMENT OF TOTAL 25-OHD,
WITH LEVELS <20 NG/ML INDICATIVE OF VITAMIN D
DEFICIENCY WHILE LEVELS BETWEEN 20 NG/ML AND 30
NG/ML SUGGEST INSUFFICIENCY. OPTIMAL LEVELS ARE

      REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6463**] [**2169-1-28**], 9:45AM.
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).

CXR: [**2169-1-27**]  No overt CHF or pneumonia.

LIVER-GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND: There are no comparisons. The
liver demonstrates normal echotexture. There is no intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation. The gallbladder contains
a shadowing 8-mm gallstone. There is, however, no evidence of
acute cholecystitis. The common bile duct measures 3 mm. The
right kidney measures 11.1 cm and is unremarkable without
evidence of hydronephrosis.

IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis

Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Since the
previous
tracing of [**2169-1-27**] the rate is slower and ST-T wave
abnormalities may be less.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: No hemorrhage, mass effect, hydrocephalus,
or shift of normally midline structures. No major vascular
territorial infarct is apparent. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The ventricles and sulci are
prominent reflecting age-related involutional change.
Subcortical periventricular white matter hypodensities are seen,
most consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
Calcification is seen within the cavernous carotids. Mild
mucosal thickening is seen within bilateral maxillary sinuses.
The remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells remain normally aerated.

CTA HEAD AND NECK: The brachiocephalic trunk and the left common
carotid originate from a common trunk off the aortic arch, in
what is termed a bovine arch configuration, a normal variant.

The right vertebral artery is diminutive compared to the left,
throughout its course. While this may be due to hypoplasia,
superimposed atherosclerotic stenosis cannot be excluded given
the
