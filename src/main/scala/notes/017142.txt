Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Cough
Reason for MICU transfer: Hypoxia and hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
54 year old male with endstage rectal neuroendocrine small cell
type presented to ED with shortness of breath.

On the day of admission family noticed labored breathing this
morning they initially debated wherther to call the hospice
nurse however eventually decided tro call. Son reported that he
had been having black tarry stools of several days duration.
Regarding his cancer history, Rectal neuroendocrine carcinoma
(small cell type)KRAS mutated metastasized to liver, lung and
bones with progression through carboplatin etoposide x 2 and
irinotecan weekly x 8. Liver metastasis resulted obstructive
jaundice with intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation and ERCP
placement of metal stent to R hepatic duct on [**2133-6-11**].

In the ED patient hypoxic to 70's, SBP in 70's placed on NRB
with sats in 100. He had a dirty femoral catheter placed. Labs
were remarkable for HCT: 14.8 HGB 4.1 WBC 33.2 INR 5.4 AST 265
ALT 109 tbili 16.0  K:7.1, Lactate:15.1 Showed ABG 6.83/28/248.
GUIAC positive, given 2 units PRBC and 1 unit platlets. CXR with
right infiltrate given vanc and zosyn for HCAP. EKG showed
peaked T waves on EKG. Given multiple doses of calcium
gluconate, albuterol, insulin, and bicarb.



On arrival to MICU:
Vitals T97.5 HR100 BP76/48 RR29 99% on 4L NC on 0.34 levophed
with blood and fluid hanging.
Patient was in pain, confused, not responding to commands, with
Kussmal breathing. Discussed goals of care with family and
verified patient's DNR/DNI status. Overall family wants
aggressive care but no further esclation of care.

hepatic
lesions consistent with progression of disease, increase in size
of perirectal and presacral lymph nodes, and stable-appearing
sclerotic density in L1.
- [**2133-4-10**] Dose 1 Irinotecan weekly
- [**2133-4-17**] Dose 2 Irinotecan weekly

- [**2133-5-25**] Dose 7 Irinotecan weekly
- [**2133-6-1**] Dose 8 Irinotecan weekly
- [**2133-6-8**] CT torso showed marked interval increase in
metastatic
disease burden within the liver causing intrahepatic biliary
ductal dilation. Increased size of primary rectosigmoid mass
with
conglomeration of pathologic lymph nodes. New spinal metastases
in T7, T8, T11, and new growth in L1. Cortex markedly thinned
but
intact. Pathologic fracture of right 5th rib and left pubic
ramus.
- [**2133-6-10**] Zoledronic acid
- [**2133-6-11**] ERCP with stent placement and sphincterotomy for
obstructive jaundice/cholangitis due to malignant stricture

Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo male with metastatic rectal neuroendocrine carcinoma
(small cell type) presents in shock and multiorgan failure
course complicated by upper gastrointestinal bleed, and
hypoxemic respiratory failure resulting in death.

# Hypovolemic Shock: Related to acute blood loss with possible
overlap with sepsis from a pulmonary source. Patient admitted
with HCT down to 14.8 from 28 and reports of black stools x 1
week prior to admission. NG lavage was performed which returned
frank blood. He was started on PPI drip and trnasfused 3 units
PRBC and 1 unit FFP. Abdomen was distended and he was not
stooling. He was acidemic with lactate of 15. Given tenouous
clinical status and goals of care to exclude intubation, EGD was
not persued as he would have decompensated during the procedure.
He was treated with agressive fluids and norepinephrine and
phenylephrine to maintain MAP >60 until he succame to his
illness.

# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was sent to the
hospital by family because of cough and lavbored breathing. He
was found to have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (though CXR
was limited by position). Given recent hospitalization, he was
staretd on vanc/zosyn for HCAP cioverage. He was also found to
be severe acidemic with kussmal's breathing on admission.
Respiratory status deteriorated, goals of care were addressed
and the decision to forgoe intubation was made based on the
wishes of the son and HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 18915**] [**Name (NI) **]. [**Name (NI) **] was given
morphine for comfort and pain. Breathing gradually became more
labored and he expired with family at the bedside.

# Goals of care: Patient had been on hospice 3 times prior to
admission and had been taken off hospice by the family after
decompensation. Patient was evaluated by his primary oncologist
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 45322**] in the ED with the ED staff and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 45322**]
recommended DNR/DNI. Following admissio
