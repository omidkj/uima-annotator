Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo lady presents from hospice with hypoxia, dyspnea, sepsis.
.
1. Hypotension/sepsis. The source of her septic episode was
likely pulmonary, with a small right hilar opacity seen on CXR.
She also had a UTI her urinalysis at her hospice. She was placed
on levofloxacin and clindamycin in the ED. She was intuibated in
the ED for respiratory distress. It was difficult to assess her
respiratory status originally because an ABG could not be drawn,
[**1-28**] her flexure contracture of her upper extremities. VBG
obtained 7.37/50/41, and patient was pan-cultured. Her sputum
cultures grew out 2+MRSA and proteus, and she was placed on
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, later switched to
vancomycin and ceftriaxone of which she completed 10 of a 14 day
course.
Her ventilator settings were weaned, gradually down to FiO2 0.40
and PEEP 5.
She was placed on norepinephrine for pressure support, and was
gradually weaned down, with intermittent fluid boluses. At the
time that the decision was made to make patient CMO, she was not
completely off her norepinephrine drip because she was unable to
keep her MAPs above 60.
Her cortisol stimulation test was normal, and her blood sugars
were well-controlled with ISS.

2. Hypernatremia. Patient originally had a free water deficit of
approximately 6.5 liters. She received IVF and free water
boluses with her tube feeds. Her hypernatremia resolved through
her hospital stay.

3. Comfort/sedation: She was placed on a fentanyl/versed drip,
and remained comfortable. She was transitioned to morphine and
ativan when CMO.

4. Access: Patient originally had a femoral line placed in the
ER. This was then replaced by a right subclavian.

5. Diarrhea. Patient was found to be C. difficile positive, and
was started on flagyl tid. She was on day 7 of abx when made
CMO.

6. Anemia. Patient had known iron deficiency anemia. She was
transfused prn to goal Hct>25.

7. FEN. Patient received tube feeds with free water flushes to
correct her hypernatremia. Her electrolytes were supplemented as
needed.

8. Code status: Multiple sites of documented hospice, dnr, dni,
do not hospitalize, all reversed by daughter night prior to
admission.  Day prior to pt's death, ethics and palliative care
consultants, in meeting with daughter, arranged for pt. to be
CMO (again). She was then extubated and started on a
morphine/ativan drip, and transferred out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the
floor.

9. Dispo: Patient expired on the floor.

10. PPx: Patient was placed on heparin sc 1000 tid, given
protonix 40 qd, and pneumoboots.
