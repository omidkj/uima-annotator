History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 63 yo M w/ h/o COPD, CAD MI [**58**] s/p cabg '[**66**]
admitted [**2177-4-15**] sof SOB x1 month after found to have an O2 sat
in the 70's at his PCP's office.  Patient reports that 1-2 years
ago he stopped taking all of his inhaler medications and that he
had been fine from a COPD perspective.  He denies having any
fevers, chills, PND or orthopnea prior to seeing his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
his PCP's office her was sent to the ED (on [**2177-4-15**]).
In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was afebrile, tachycardic and 99% on 4L O2.  He has
a CXR which showed a question of a retrocardiac opacity.  CTA
was negative for PE, but did show diffuse tree in [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities.
 Patient was given empiric vancomycin, ceftriazone,
azithromycin, tamiflu and solumedrol.  However, in the ED he
became agitated and a blood gas showed a pCO2 of >100, so he was
intubated and sent to the ICU.
In the ICU, he improved on the ventilator.  His antibiotics were
narrowed to just levo on [**4-16**].  In addition, his flu swab
returned negative and his tamiflu was stopped.  His sputum Cx is
still pending.  Patient's blood gas on morning of [**4-17**] was
7.37/66/121 on FIO2 40% 5/5, so he was then weaned to 5/0 for
several hrs prior to extubation which happened on morning of
[**4-17**].  On transfer to the floor he was on 2L NC and satting
91-93%.  Of note, his atenolol had been held in the ICU, and he
was also borderline tachycardic in the 90's at transfer.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, patient became tachycardic to the
140's, but was asymptomatic with BP stable in the 130's.  He was
given back his home PO dose of atenolol 50mg QD and aslo IV
metoprolol 5mg x1 and HR went back to low 100's.  He remained
asymptomatic throughout, and EKG at HR of 140's showed ?
aflutter, which resolved when pt's rate was better controlled.

MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2177-4-17**]):
      POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.

CTA Chest [**2177-4-15**] - 1. Widespread tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] nodular opacities
most compatible with a small airways infectious process.
Mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is likely
reactive. 2. No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.

Echo [**2177-4-16**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal hypokinesis of the basal inferior septum and
inferior/inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 45-50 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**1-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Preserved right ventricular function.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo man with history of COPD/emphysema and CAD who presented
with shortness of breath and hypoxemia and was admitted to the
ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure.

# Hypoxemic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Intubated in
the ED in setting of PCO2 > 100 and agitation.  He was then
admitted to the MICU for further management.  CT Chest showed
diffuse tree in [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 239**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 89881**] concerning for underlying infection
that likely triggered COPD exacerbation (not on medications > 1
year).  Patient was started on high dose IV steroids, Levoquin
for probable CAP, and Oseltamivir pending flu rule out.  Flu was
negative, and oseltamavir stopped.  Ventilation improved on vent
and Mr. [**Known lastname **] was extubated after less than 48 hours on
mechanical ventiliation.  He was transferred to floor for
further management where he was continued on levo for a 5 day
course, and trantitioned to an oral prednisone taper (60, 60,
40, 40, 20, 20, 10, 10 stop). He was continued on duonebs with
good effect.  His ambulatory O2 sat on RA was 87-94% during a
full loop of the hospital floor, and 96% at rest.  He was sent
home with an Rx for nebs, a neb machine, albuterol inhaler, the
rest of his levo course and the rest of his steroid taper.

# COPD exacerbation: pt with multiple tree in [**Male First Name (un) 239**] signs on CT
suggestive of small airways infectious process, likely causing
COPD exacerbation. Possible CAP, though no focal consolidation
noted.  Patient treated with ABx and steroids as above in
addition to nebs.  His O2 sat goal was 88-93% given likely
chronic
