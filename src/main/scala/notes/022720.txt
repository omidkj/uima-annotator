Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 25 yo woman w/ [**First Name3 (LF) **]'s syndrome (DM/DI, optic
nerve atrophy), asthma, presented to ED with cough, malaise and
fatigue x 7 days. She also endorsed mild dyspnea x 3 days along
with a nonproductive cough. She denied any fever, no chest pain.
It is similar to her PNA bout in [**1-16**] but not as severe.
Patient subsequently presented to the ED on [**2-12**] AM where she was
noted to be hypoxic to 88 on RA. Chest X-ray was consistent with
RML pneumonia and she was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. She was subsequently admitted to the medicine
floor. Of note, HR was in the 140s upon transfer, BP was 148/64.
The patient was subsequently triggered on arrival to the floor
with persistent tachycardia. She continued to require oxygen and
was placed on 4 L NC with O2 sats ranging 91-95. Oxygenation
improved to 100 with deep breating. She remained tachypneic. Her
tachycardia briefly worsened with rates to 150's. This was only
minimally responsive to fluids (1 L total given)
An ABG was done and was pH 7.37 pCO2 40 pO2 75 HCO3 24.
Antibiotic coverage was broadened with Zosyn and vancomycin and
pt was transferred to MICU given concern for sepsis, tacycardia,
and impending respiratory failure.

ROS: she reports normal appetite, no nausea/vomiting, no chest
pain, no wheezing, has been using her albulterol [**4-14**] x /24 hours
PTA, no sob at rest, more doe with minimal exertion, no
abdominal pain, no diarrhea, no dysuria/hematuria, no
myalgias/arthralgias, again endorsed fatigue and malaise for
last 7 days. Patient also reports higher FS last 2 weeks with a
value of 500s last week, no polyuria at home, but since she has
been getting IVFs. She also endorsed upper airway weezing x 2
days.


Past Medical History:
# [**1-16**] hospitalization for hypoxia - and presumed PNA with LLL
and RML infiltrates, likely atelectasis with left pleural;
culture was negative. Patient required aggresive chest PT with
subsequent RLL reinsuflation. She was treated with Azithro/CTX
and then cefpodoxime for 7 days. Patient was also started on
steroids for presumed asthma exacerbation.

IMAGING
CXR [**2-12**]: The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
normal. There is a new opacities within the right middle lobe
and likely the left lung base. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is detected. The osseous structure of thorax appear
normal.

CXR [**2-17**]: IMPRESSION: Worsening of bibasal consolidations, now
accompanied by atelectasis and pleural effusion.

CXR [**2-18**]: IMPRESSION: Likely multifocal pneumonia with
improvement in middle lobe. Persistent effusions, increased on
the left.

Renal US [**2111-2-14**]: The right kidney measures 10.9 cm. The left
kidney measures 11.2 cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis,
nephrolithiasis, or renal mass. The bladder is distended with a
thin wall. Pre-void bladder volume is 359 cc and post- void is
340 cc. The history provided in the prior study ([**2108**]) was of
neurogenic bladder.

CTU [**2-16**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No renal stones or masses identified. Mild dilation of the
ureters could relate to [**Month/Day (4) **]'s syndrome.
2. Right middle and left lower lobe pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 698**] is a 24 year old woman with history of [**Known firstname **]'s
Syndrome, history of severe PNA in past, who was briefly in the
MICU for tachycardia without signs of sepsis, who had a
prolonged hospital course for multilobar pneumonia and excessive
secretions with persistent O2 requirement. By discharge, the
patient's breathing was improved, other issues stable, and sent
home to complete 14 day course of PO antibiotics.

1. Multilobar pneumonia - Patient was initially admitted to the
medicine floor and started on CTX/azithromycin for RML PNA by
CXR. She has a history of prolonged hospital stay for PNA in
[**1-16**] a year prior due to her concurrent poor lung capacity and
mucous secretions. She was briefly put on additional vancomycin
and flagyl in the MICU but was weaned back to CTX/azithomycin
given her lack of fever and improvement. However, despite this
treatment, the patient had continued O2 requirement and an
episode of mucous plugging leading to acute respiratory distress
on [**2111-2-18**] initially requiring NRB but then weaned back to 4L by
NC, so her antibiotic coverage was broadened to
CTX/vancomycin/flagyl to cover for nosocomial PNA. Sputum
culture showed GPC in pairs and GNR but with culture only
consistent with oropharyngeal flora so vancomycin was
discontinued a few days later. She was slowly weaned to PO
antibiotics and continued to improve and be afebrile on
cefpodoxime/flagyl for the last several days of her hospital
course, with conjunctive treatment of her excessive mucous
secretions with mucomyst, guaifenesin, aggre
