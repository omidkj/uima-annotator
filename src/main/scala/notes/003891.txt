Chief Complaint:
AMS, intubated

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Extubation

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 66 yo F with a history of CVA, HTN, HLD who was
transferred from an OSH with altered mental status. Per report,
the patient had a fall 2 days ago after slipping on ice after
the snowstorm and falling on her right side. She was diagnosed
with R sided rib fractures during an urgent care visit at the
[**Hospital 6598**] [**Hospital **] Clinic the next day. She was prescribed vicodin
and asked to come back for CT scan. Family states the patient
took [**1-20**] a tablet of vicodin last night, but did not become
altered until this morning. When they came to see her at home,
they found she was more altered; she was lying on the couch,
more lethargic, not taking good POs or any of her medications,
and complaining of a headache. She was brought into the OSH
([**Hospital1 **]/[**Hospital1 6136**]) for further evaluation. There, the patient
was given Narcan without good effect. She was reportedly
intubated for a GCS of 6 and for airway protection in the
setting of vomiting. Labs at the OSH significant for Hct of
42.9, Plts 221, INR of 1.0, Na 139 K 3.9, Cre: 1.3, negative
EtOH, tylenol, and ASA levels . Pt was guaiac negative, and
gastric occult negative. Head CT at OSH was also negative for
acute new infarct. Received Zosyn 3.25 mg IV x1. She was placed
on propofol for sedation, but subsequently noted post-intubation
to become hypotensive, required 1 L IVFs and was started on
peripheral dopamine and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluaton.
.
In the ED, admission VS were 88 141/78 (dopa) 20 100% (PS [**10-28**]
PEEP of 5). Pt received a fentanyl boluses with midazolam gtt.
Her dopamine was quickly weaned with 2 L of IVFs. Labs sig for
Cre of 1.3, WBC of 15.8, Hct of 32.9, and urine toxicology
screen positive for benzos and methadone. Vancomycin 1 gram IV
x1 given. Patient noted to be interacting appropriately on
minimal sedation. Trauma series was performed (CT Head, CT
C-spine, CT Torso) which showed a LLL consolidation and rib
fractures but no obvious bleed or C-spine fractures. Head CT
negative for acute intracranial process but does show old
MCA-PCA watershed infarct. C-collar was placed. Trauma Surgery
was consulted and will be following for tertiary survey in AM
and clearance of C-spine in AM.
.
On the floor, patient was alert and interactive. Able to
indicate pain from her rib fractures.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Altered mental status: Patient was initially found to have
altered mental status after slip and fall on ice. She sustained
R sided rib fractures which were treated with vicodin. She was
found by family to be altered and brought to OSH where she was
intubated for GCS 6. She had also had a URI prior to OSH
presentation. Initial AMS was likely multifactorial due to
infection (pneumonia, likely acquired in setting of splinting
from rib pain [**2-20**] fractures), medication induced from narcotics
(received vicodin for pain control) but urine toxicology screen
also positive for methadone, and ABG showed an acute respiratory
acidosis concerning for respiratory depression. Toxicology
screen negative at OSH for EtOH, APAP, and ASA. No evidence of
new ICH or stroke on head CT. No evidence of UTI on urine
analysis. Cardiac etiology was ruled out with cardiac enzymes
negative x 2. Patient was extubated with good mental status but
subsequently became increasingly altered, thought to be
associated with morphine use for pain control. This delirium
resolved upon avoiding opioid medications such as morphine and
oxycodone.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Pt initially hypoxic with pna and
splinting from pain, intubated [**2-20**] altered mental status. The pt
was extubated after transfer from [**Hospital1 18**], with decreasing O2
requirement. She was found to have a pneumonia and was started
on Levaquin for presumed CAP. However, patient continued spiking
despite abx. Given sputum cx stained 2+ GPC in pairs and chains,
2+ [**Name (NI) **], pt was broadened to Vanc/Zosyn (pt is allergic to
penicillins but has tolerated zosyn in the past). Abx were
continued for an eight day course (last day [**2-9**]). She was also
encouraged to use incentive spirometer and pain was controlled
as below.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **], prerenal, hypovolemic: pt??????s cr increased from nadir 1.0
to 1.5. Cr improved with ivf hydration.  Cr was 1.2 by next day.
.
# normocytic anemia: Hct down to 32.9 from 42 at OSH. HCT slowly
trending down. No evidence of intra-abdominal bleed on CT scans.
Iron studies [**Location (un) 381**] levels, showing element of iron
deficiency, likely mixed with anemia of chronic disease.  no
