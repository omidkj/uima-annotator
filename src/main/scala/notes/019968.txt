History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 107322**] is an 89 year old Russian speaking female with a PMH
significant for atrial fibrillation, CRI, Type II DM and recent
pneumonia [**10-25**] who presents with respiratory distress starting
this [**Last Name (un) 44550**].  At her nursing home, the patient was noted to be
mildly short of breath yesterday with wheezes by report and was
started on 2 liters nasal cannula.  This morning she became
tachypneic with an 02 sat in the upper 80's on 2 liters NC and
improved to 95% on NRB.  She was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
further management and given nebulizers in route.  Per report,
the patient complained of transient chest pain as well.

In the ED, she got nebs, solumedrol, vanc/ceftriaxone/flagyl and
was placed on BiPAP.  A nitroglycerin drip and lasix was given
after her BNP came back at 40,000 and the chest x-ray showed an
large right effusion and findings consistent with CHF.  An EKG
was done which showed T wave inversions in the anteroseptal
leads. The patient was able to come off BiPAP after diuresis.
The patient gives a history of worsening SOB at night with
associated palpitations over the past few weeks.  She denies
fever, however, has had an occasional non-productive cough.  She
denied CP in ED but was confused per her son's assessment.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2172-2-28**]
1) Moderate right pleural effusion; small left pleural effusion.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
2) Mild cardiac failure.

Echo [**2172-3-3**]:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 year old Russian speaking female with a PMH significant for
atrial fibrillation, CRI, Type II DM and recent pneumonia [**10-25**]
who presents with respiratory distress.

In the ED she received nebs, Solu-Medrol,
vanc/ceftriaxone/Flagyl, nitroglycerin drip, Lasix, and was
placed on BiPAP. An EKG was done which showed T wave inversions
in the anteroseptal leads. The patient was able to come off
BiPAP after diuresis.

In the MICU the Nitro gtt was stopped and her Imdur and
Amlodipine were titrated up. She was diuresed 2.5 liters.
Ceftriaxone/Flagyl were d/c'ed, Vanco was continued for MRSA in
her urine. Her HCT dropped from 30 to 24 on [**2-29**] and she was
transfused one Unit of PRBC's. She was also noted to have an non
anion gap acidosis thought to be consistent with an RTA.

1) CHF exacerbation thought to be etiology of respiratory
distress. Her respiratory status was stable with prn diuresis (~
20 mg of po Lasix daily). She remained with O2 sats in the low
90%'s on RA. An echo revealed moderate global LV hypokinesis
with an EF of 30-35%. Her goal is even to 500 cc negative. On
day of discharge she appeared euvolemic. She was discharged on
10 mg of po Lasix. It was not increased further secondary to an
increase in her Cr from baseline (up to 1.7 on day of
discharge). She was started on Captopril which was converted to
5 mg of Lisinopril at discharge. Her Cr and K will be checked in
2 days and followed-up by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] at [**Hospital3 2558**].

2) CAD. Pt was found to have new T wave inversions and mildly
elevated troponin (likely secondary to CRI) which remained flat.
She was ruled out for MI with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes. As [**Name6 (MD) **]
the RN at [**Hospital3 2558**] she has a h/o angina requiring PRN SL
NTG. She was continued on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and Metop 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Her BP was well controlled on Imdur and amlodipine as well.

3) CRI: (baseline Cr of 1.2-1.5). Cr slightly elevated above
baseline thought to be secondary to addition of ACEI and Lasix.
She had good UO.

4) ANEMIA: HCT drop from 30 (baseline) to 24 on [**2-29**]. Appropriate
increase with one unit of PRBC's. Guaiac negative. Anemia may be
secondary to CRI. B12, folate, Fe studies WNL. HCT remained
stable throughout her stay.

5) UTI. Pt with chronic Foley at nursing home. Urine culture
initially grew MRSA, however it was thought that her urine was
colonized given chronic Foley. She was given 4 days of Vanco
d/c'ed on [**3-2**] (initial UA with >50 WBC's). Repeat UA negative.
She was discharged with a Foley catheter.

6) TYPE II DM: Pt is diet controlled at nursing home. She was
continued on a RISS while hospitalized.

7) NON-ANION GAP MET ACIDOSIS - resolved. Urinary anion gap c/w
RTA. As per renal recs no further management.

8) FEN: She was given a soft solid diet with thin liquids, all
her meds were crushed.

9) CODE: Full, confirmed with son

10) COMM: son - [**Name (NI) **]; MD [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] - [**Location (un) 4223**] (pager
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 107326**]); PCP-[**Name Initial (NameIs) 9449**]

11) dispo: She returned to [**Hospital3 2558**]. She will need to have
her fluid status monitored and diuretics given PRN.
