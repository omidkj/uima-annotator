There has been no change in the multiloculated right
hydropneumothorax, the largest component at the base, next
smaller anteriorly, smallest at the right apex. Subcutaneous
emphysema in the right chest wall is improving. Left lung is
clear. Heart size is normal. There is persistent edema and
atelectasis at the base of the residual right lung.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80151**] was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
[**2195-12-1**] for Right thoracotomy, right lower lobe sleeve
lobectomy, anastomosis of right middle lobe bronchus to bronchus
intermedius, intercostal muscle flap, therapeutic bronchoscopy,
and mediastinal lymph node dissection. He recovered in the ICU,
extubated POD 0, and had two remaining chest tubes, which were
placed on water seal. He was transfered to the floor on POD 1.
On [**2195-12-3**] he developed large amounts of subcutaneous
emphysema. He underwent bronch [**2195-12-7**] revealing sealed
anastomosis site. Right middle lobe secretions were aspirated.
The patient developed fevers, rigors, and tachycardia, but
maintained blood pressure. He was pancultured and vanco,zosyn
were started. He resolved this in one day. His chest tube was
discontinued on [**2195-12-9**], but he continued to have persistent
airleak out of the posterior chest tube. He developed afib with
RVR on [**2195-12-10**], treated with IV lopressor and eventually
diltiazem gtt. Cardiology was consulted.

On [**2195-12-11**] he had bronchoscopy for worsened airleak and
subcutaneous emphysema, revealing an anastomotic leak at 2oclock
position. He then went down to the OR for completion right
middle lobectomy. He was brought to the ICU where he recovered.
To note he had CT revealing air in mediastinum most likely
causing the atrial fibrillation. His atrial fibrillation stopped
after amiodarone drip and oral dosing. He stabilized in the ICU
and was transfered to the floor, where he then on [**2195-12-18**] was
found to have persistent air leak secondary to a pinhole opening
in the stoma. This was sealed with fibrin glue. On [**2195-12-20**] he
went to the OR for Flexible bronchoscopy, instillation of
surgical plug (Surgisis collagen matrix), instillation of fibrin
glue, and stent placement (Ultraflex covered 30 x 14 mm) from
the
right mainstem bronchus to the right upper lobe bronchus.

He recovered on the floor, then on [**2195-12-24**] required another trip
to the OR for re-do thoracotomy, lysis of adhesions, closure of
bronchopleural fistula and reinforcement of closure
withpericardium, thymic fat pad and intercostal muscle. The
patient did well after this last surgery, with two right sided
chest tubes remaining, last pulled on [**2195-12-29**], with PA and
Lateral CXR revealing normal fluid filling of the right lower
pleural space on [**2195-12-30**]. The patient had ID consultation and
completed vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole. Latest cultures
were all negative and antibiotics stopped [**2195-12-24**]. He developed
cdif which flagyl was started [**2195-12-25**] and clinically he
improved. He did have another 12 hour incident of atrial
fibrillation on [**2195-12-27**] which resolved after amiodarone IV
loading. After discussion with cardiology, it was determined his
[**Country **] score was low enough that he would be fine with just
aspirin 325mg, amiodarone taper and outpatient follow up with
cardiology.

The patient had complaints of dysphagia early on which revealed
air near the posterior wall of the pharynx, however this
resolved and was most likely related to his anastomotic leak. He
was cleared for regular diet and thin liquids by speech and
swallow, but with crushed pills. His complaints of tongue pain
were evaluated mid hospital course by ENT, however nothing was
found.
The patient was ambulating the halls, with controlled pain, and
good urine output without constipation. He was hemodynamically
stable without fever and stable xray. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] deemed the
patient stable for discharge home with home PT as recommended by
PT. The patient was instructed to follow up cdif after the
flagyl is complete with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] follow up with his
cardiologist regarding his hx of atrial fibrillation. His right
thoractomy site was intact and sutures removed [**2195-12-29**] with
steristrips placed for reinforcement on day of discharge.
