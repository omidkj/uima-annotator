Brief Hospital Course:
     81yo F underwent ascending aortic and proximal arch repair
with Gelweave graft on [**2192-4-24**]; see operative report for
details. Pt was brought post-operatively to the cardiac surgery
intensive care unit, intubated, with chest tubes, pacing wires,
and Foley catheter in place. She had moderate pressor
requirements overnight. On POD 1, she experienced a witnessed
grand mal seizure that self-terminated after 2 minutes. Dilantin
and Ativan were provided thereafter; a CT Head showed old
infarct but no new infarct, and no further seizure activity was
witnessed. Repeat Head CT 2 days later was limited by motion
artifact, and MRI showed subacute infarcts. EEG was negative for
seizure and Carotid duplex was negative for stenotic plaque.
     The hemodynamics improved over the next several days and
the pressor agents of epinephrine and neosynephrine were weaned
off.  Attempts to extubation were withheld due to patient's
inability to follow commands or orient to surroundings, precedex
was tried as well.  She also had residual LUE motor deficit.
Sedating meds were ceased.
     On POD 4, swelling of the L arm was evaluated with
Ultrasound Doppler which showed occlusive thrombus of the L
internal jugular vein and L basilic vein, but the subclavian and
cephalic veins were patent and anticoagulation was not given.
Around this time, the heart rate intermittently went into AFib
and AFlutter, controlled on lopressor and amiodarone, but the
combination of AFib and DVT prompted the decision to
anticoagulate with heparin drip (without bolus) on POD 6.  Upon
achieving therapeutic levels (which subsequently overshot), the
hematocrit dropped 9 points from 30 to 21, hemodynamics remained
stable, abdominal exam was soft, and stools were only trace
guaiac positive.  Heparin was held, CT torso showed a large left
retroperitoneal hematoma measuring 20x10x8cm.  Coagulopathy was
reversed with platelet transfusion (1unit), and ultimately she
consumed 7u PRBCs, 6u FFP. CT also showed mediastinal widening;
a Swan-Ganz catheter was re-placed, a TTE showed no significant
effusion or decreased ejection fraction, and renal ultrasound
showed no hydronephrosis.  In the context of this work-up, a HIT
was sent and resulted positive; but given the prior bleed the
decision was made not to actively anticoagulate to treat the
HIT+.  From this event, she did experience a bump in BUN/Cr and
LFTs from shock liver and pre-renal ATN, both of which resolved
over the next few days.
     She did vent wean to minimal support but remained
neurologically non-interactive.  An extubation attempt on POD 14
was unsuccessful and she was re-
