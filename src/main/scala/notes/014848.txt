Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R-PICC [**8-10**]--removed prior to sending to rehab
GJ Tube [**8-17**] via IR guidance-->sutures are to be removed in 10
days.


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 86 year-old man with afib, prostate CA, recent
non-traumatic SDH s/p Burr hole & left craniotomy [**2113-6-20**], who
presents with newly noted right sided weakness at rehab.
Pt was hospitalization one wk ago PTA ([**Date range (1) 51030**]) w/ CHF. He
underwent b/l thoracentesis, which showed transudative effusion.
He was discharged to rehab on PRN lasix. At rehab, he was
recently resumed on ASA and subcutaneous heparin. He was dx'd
with C.diff and VRE urinary tract infection, which are being
treated with PO vanco & linezolid respectively.
On the day of presentation, the pt was noted to have acute onset
of right-sided weaknessat ~12:40 pm while working with therapy
this afternoon at [**Hospital6 **]. He was noted to
have acute onset of right facial droop, pocketing food in the
right side of his mouth. He could no longer hold a cup in his
right hand, and could no longer feed himself. There was concern
that he might have "increased" right-sided neglect with the
possibility of non-specified right-sided vision loss. Vitals
there at 1 pm were: T 98, BP 124/60, P 80, RR 20, SaO2 95 RA.
The patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
In the ED, a code stroke was called by the ED at 2:06 pm;
however, the code stroke was called off shortly after, when the
recent hemorrhage was determined to exclude the possibility of
thrombolysis/intervention. Prelim read on Head CT showed slight
decrease in extent of SDH; however, there was e/o some acute
bleed.
.
Once he arrived on neurology wards, he was noted to be
tachypneic (RR 30s), 02 sat on 2L ~60% (per neuro resident). He
was placed on NRB w/ improvement to 100%. Pt was given 40mg IV
lasix b/c ? acute pulm edema. ABG was 7.34/39/205. CXR was
relatively unchanged from that done in [**Name (NI) **]. Pt transferred to
MICU for further eval & tx. Labs showed increase in trop from
below assay to 0.36, though ck not elevated. Pt developed anion
gap acidosis, lactate 1.8. WBC rising 10-->17.8. Na 131-->129.

Review of Systems: Pt nods head yes to SOB, but no to pain.
Unable to provide addn'l ROS due to severe dysarthria/resp
distress.

Social History:
Patient is a retired architectural engineer. He is currently
residing at [**Hospital6 **] following his SDH. Patient has a
10 pack year smoking history, but quit in [**2058**].


Family History:
Father had lung cancer at age 68.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 98.9 F BP 138/56 P 89 RR 28 SaO2 100% on NRB
General: thin elderly man, sl uncomfortable appearing laying in
bed
HEENT: left-sided healing craniotomy scar, sclerae anicteric,
dry MM, with thrush seen on roof of mouth
Neck: mildly limited passive ROM, but no nuchal rigidity, no
bruits
Lungs: occcasional wheezes with cough, decreased breath sounds
at bases
CV: regular rate and rhythm, no MMRG
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present
Ext: cool dry, no significant edema with stockings in place,
pedal pulses appreciated
Skin: no rashes
.
Neurologic Examination (per neuro note--agree w/ exam):
Mental Status:
Sleepy, inattentive, can occasionally respond appropriately to
some basic questions, though it is very difficult to understand,
given severe dysarthria, language is non-fluent and dysarthric,
following some commands appropriately cooperative with exam when
able, but appears to be neglecting right side of space
Cranial Nerves:
Optic disc margins sharp; may have homonymous hemianopsia on
right side of space, though difficult to tell. Pupils ~4 mm,
surgical, unreactive, and irregular bilaterally. Extraocular
intact vertically, but both eyes appear to be looking left, left
eye appears somewhat exotropic, both eyes crossed midline with
occulocephalics. Reports facial sensation intact bilaterally.
Has a right facial droop involving the lip and eye lid. Hearing
intact to finger rub bilaterally. Palate elevates midline.
Tongue protrudes midline, no fasciculations. Trapezii full
strength on left, 4-/5 on right.
Motor:
Normal bulk and reduced tone throughout. No tremor, no
asterixis. Cannot comply with formal testing, able to hold left
arm and leg anti-gravity for at least 10 sconds. Right arm and
leg immediately drifft down and to the right.
.
Sensation: Withdraws all 4 extremities symmetrically to noxious,
with grimace. Extinguishes right side on DSS.
.
Reflexes:
Normal reflexes on the left and brisk throughout on the right.
Right toe possibly upgoing, left toe downgoing.
.
Coordination: Left FNF without dysmetria, unable to do perform
on right. Unable to attend to make reasonable attempt to perform
HKS.


Pertinent Results:
EKG: initial ECG in ED V-paced accelerated idioventricular
rhythm, w/ stable concordant TWI in V3-6.
- Repeat ECG peri-resp distress: likely afib; more pronounced
TWI in V3-6, and inferior leads.
.
CT head, non-contrast:
No evidence of ischemia although MRI is more sensitive for acute
ischemia. Interval decrease in left subdural collection.
However, small amount of superimposed acute subdural bleeding
cannot be excluded, but there is no mass effect.
.
ECHO [**8-11**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50
%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-8-3**], RV
size is now normal and RV systolic function remains normal.
