Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catherization (Bare Metal Stent x 2 - LAD, LCx)
Swan Ganz catherter placement and subsequent removal

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old man with a past medical history
significant for hypertension who presents as a transfer from
[**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] with chest pain and concern for anterior STEMI.
The patient woke this morning and, while showering, developed
chest pain which felt like "someone sitting" on his chest; the
pain was initially mild but increased in intensity. He
experienced profuse diaphoresis and increasing shortness of
breath. He initially called his daughter, but as the symptoms
increased, he called EMS and was taken to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**]. There,
he received plavix 600 mg X 1, asa 325 mg, lopressor 5 mg,
heparin bolus & drip, nitroglycerin drip, integrillin bolus &
drip, and morphine. EKG showed ST elevations in V1-V5 and I,
hyperacute T waves throughout the precordium, and flipped T in
III, Q waves in V1-3. Initial CK 53. The patient was urgently
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab where angiography showed
subtotal thrombosis of the mid-LAD which was stented with a bare
metal stent; there was also evidence of L circumflex thrombus,
which was also stented with a bare metal stent.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient denies chest pain. He is
breathing comfortable but requiring non-rebreather to maintain
an oxygen saturation of 96%.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. The patient typically walks
up to [**1-1**] miles several times per week without any chest pain or
dyspnea. He also performs back exercises daily.


Past Medical History:
1) Hypertension
2) Prior esophageal ulcer several years ago (in setting of
taking aspirin for pain, 2 tabs Q4H)
3) Low back pain
4) s/p cholecystectomy complicated by pancreatitis
5) s/p coccyx removal


Social History:
No prior history of tobacco use; he drinks a glass of wine with
dinner several times per week. He is a retired medicinal
chemist.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death. [**Name (NI) **] mother had rheumatic heart disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, AS REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN MULTI
DISCIPLINARY ROUNDS
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old male with a history of hypertension
who was admitted with an anterior ST elevation myocardial
infarction s/p bare metal stenting to the left anterior
descending artery and left circumflex artery.
.
Anterior STEMI s/p stenting: The patient was taken to the
cardiac catheterization lab and bare metal stents (LAD, LCx)
were placed.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled with peak CK of 2223
and a peak CK-MB of 184.  Cardiac enzymes began to trend
downward on [**2180-6-11**].  A lipid panel was drawn and found to be
within normal limits.  The patient was placed on aspirin 325mg
(this will be lifelong), plavix 75mg (for at least one month, to
be discontinued at the discretion of the patient's primary
cardiologist), a heparin drip, and atorvastatin 80mg.  A beta
blocker and captopril were started and titrated to the patient's
blood pressure.  On discharge, the patient was on Toprol XL 75mg
PO daily and lisinopril 2.5mg PO Daily. The patient will be
re-evaluated as an outpatient with a repeat ECHO, exercise
stress test, and Holter monitor to better risk stratify his
prognosis. He has follow up set up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 171**] in two
weeks.
.
Congestive Heart Failure s/p anterior STEMI: Left ventricular
ejection fraction on ECHO ([**2180-6-10**]) was 30-35% with
hypokinesis/akinesis of the distal two-thirds of the anterior
sep
