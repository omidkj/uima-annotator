Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5868**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute Stroke, s/p IV t-PA


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV TPA

History of Present Illness:
74 year old man with hx of CAD (s/p MI, s/p CABG), HTN, Right
carotid stenosis (s/p carotid stent [**10-5**]), and arthritis who
presented to the ED on [**11-25**] complaining of left sided weakness.
 A code stroke was called and the stroke
fellow assessed the patient immediately (Please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 105059**]
note [**11-25**] for details of initial assessment).  He was initially
found to have an NIHSS of 9.  CT/CTA was done and was negative
for early signs of infarction, but did show a paucity of vessels
in the right MCA territory.  IV tPA was administered by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at 8:53am.

I arrived at 9:00AM and obtained the following history.  Pt was
feeling well when he went to bed last night, [**11-24**]. He awoke in
his USOH on the morning of admission at 5am, watched the news,
then started to read a book. At that time, he was able to use
both hands to hold the book and had no difficulty turning the
pages.  Around 6-6:30am, he got out of bed to go to the
bathroom.  His left leg "gave out" and he slid to the floor.  He
thought that there might be something wrong with his heart so he
reached for his nitroglycerine tablets.  He noticed that he was
unable to grip the bottle with his left hand.  He crawled back
into bed and called EMS.  He was brought to the ED where he
arrived shortly after 8AM.  He was noted to have a left visual
field cut, dysarthria, left sided inattention, left facial
droop, left hemiplegia (arm>leg) and left hemisensory deficit.
He was given IV-tPA.  NIHSS=8 (see exam below).

He denies fever/chills, CP, SOB, palpitations, nausea/vomiting,
or dysuria.  He denies having similar symptoms in the past.

Head CT [**11-25**] - Abrupt cut-off of the anterior division of the
right middle cerebral artery (M3), consistent with acute
occlusive thrombus or embolus. No intracranial hemorrhage or
mass effect.

Head CT [**11-26**] and [**12-3**] - Stable head CT with evidence of evolving
right middle cerebral artery territory infarct, without definite
hemorrhage.

MRI head [**11-25**] - Large area of restricted diffusion in the right
middle cerebral artery territory in the right frontal and
temporal lobes, consistent with acute infarct. MR [**First Name (Titles) 4058**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4579**]s significantly decreased flow in the right mid
cerebral artery branches

Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**11-26**] - Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).

Carotid ultrasound [**11-28**] - Minimal plaque on the right with a
less than 40% carotid stenosis. On the left, there is moderate
plaque with a 40-59% stenosis.

Neck MRA [**11-27**] - Patent right internal carotid artery stent but
with apparent slow flow. Signal irregularity and apparent
diminutive flow through the stent could be secondary to magnetic
susceptibility from the stent, intimal hyperplasia, or a small
amount of thrombus.

Preliminarily transesophageal echocardiogram:  simple atheroma
in descending aorta

Brief Hospital Course:
74 year old man with hx of CAD, HTN, high cholesterol, smoking,
s/p recent right carotid stent, and family hx of stroke who
presents with acute onset of left sided weakness.  He is s/p IV
tPA 2.5hrs after symptom onset. Initial exam notable for left
sided inattention, dysarthria, left facial, left sided weakness
(primarily in arm with cortical hand), left sided sensory
deficit to all modalities, left sided cortical sensory loss.
Deficits localize to the right fronto-parietal region.  He was
admitted to the neuro ICU after receiving tPA; MRI/A showed M2
or M3 occlusion, no recannulization.

Neuro - Stroke was most likely related to embolism from stent
thrombus. Serial head CTs stable, but more dense weakness
beginning on HD#2. Pt was continued on aspirin and plavix for
stent. Patient was started on low dose coumadin 2.5 mg a day
with no load given that he is already on two antiplatelets.  The
target is for low INR around 2. Plan for Coumadin for 3 months,
re-image stent, if patent, discontinue Coumadin. Exam remains
most notable for dysarthria, L hemiplegia and L extinction to
double simultaneous stimulation.

CV - Ruled out for MI upon admission. Blood pressure was
initially allowed to autoregulate. HTN now controlled on
Metoprolol. No events on telemetry. TEE performed on [**12-5**] prelim
read: simple atheroma in descending aorta, moderately thick
aortic valve, no ASD or PFO (final report pending). Should
follow up with his outpatient Cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2912**],
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 25832**] after discharge from rehab. Should continue Plavix
for at least 6 months after stent placement; duration of therapy
to be guided directly by Pt's cardiologist.

FEN/GI - Pt failed initial swallow evaluations, requiring tube
feeds through [**12-3**]. Cleared by video swallow evaluation for soft
solids and thin liquids on [**12-4**].

Heme - Should start Coumadin 2.5mg QHS on [**12-5**], g
