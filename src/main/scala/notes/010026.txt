Intubation

History of Present Illness:
78 year old female with PMHx HTN, dCHF, Diabetes, CKD, Atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, ischemic stroke, admitted after
presenting to cardiology clinic today with confusion and
Somnolence. Of note, she was recently discharged at the
beginning of [**2139-5-5**] after presyncope/falls. At that time,
lasix was stopped and atenolol was switched to metoprolol as
there was concern that blunting of tachycardia could be
contributing to falls. She was discharged to rehab (previously
living at home).

Per report from the ER, patient has had confusion at home x 3
weeks, though no family accompanies her to corroborate this
story, and patient denies this. The patient is not sure why she
is in the hospital. Per OMR, she saw her cardiologist today, who
referred her to the ER after she appeared to be dehydrated,
somnolent, and confused.

This morning, the patient denies headache, blurry Vision,
numbness, tingling or weakness. No CP. +SOB, worsening DOE. No
increae LE edema. No nausea, vomiting.


Past Medical History:
-- Hypertension
-- CHF with diastolic dysfunction
-- Diabetes diet controlled
-- Prior large pulmonary embolism in the setting of
gynecological surgery with RV dysfunction, which has since
resolved.
-- Atrial fibrillation acute ischemic stroke with homonymous
hemianopia [**3-/2138**]
-- osteoarthritis
-- chronic back pain h/o spinal stenosis on chronic opiates
-- obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP
-- hypercholesterolemia
-- stress incontinence
-- bilateral pulmonary embolism in [**5-/2136**]

CSF cytology results: ATYPICAL. Many lymphocytes, including
scattered larger atypical lymphoid cells. No carcinoma is seen.
CSF flow cytometry: Non-diagnostic study.  Clonality could not
be assessed in this case due to insufficient numbers of B cells.
 Cell marker analysis was attempted, but was non-diagnostic in
this case due to insufficient numbers of cells.  If clinically
indicated, we recommend a repeat specimen be submitted to the
flow cytometry laboratory.

Brain biopsy pathology results:
1. Brain, core biopsy #1 (A-B):
Glioblastoma, WHO Grade IV. See note.

2. Brain, core biopsy #2 (C):
Glioblastoma, WHO Grade IV. See note.

3. Brain, core biopsy #3 (D):
Glioblastoma, WHO Grade IV. See note.

Note: Sections show fibrillary tumor with necrosis. Tumor cells
are pleomorphic with irregular nuclei.

STUDIES:
[**6-2**] CT head: Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation within the
right thalamus and posterior limb of the internal capsule, with
mild mass effect, which is new compared with [**2138-3-4**], and may
represent a recent infarction.  If clinically indicated, this
could be better evaluated with MRI

[**6-2**] CT C spine: 1.  No acute fracture or new subluxation of the
cervical spine.
2.  Multilevel degenerative changes as described above.
3.  Thyroid goiter, which if clinically indicated could be
further evaluated with ultrasound if not already performed.

[**6-2**] CXR:  FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral chest radiographs
demonstrate low lung volumes, though clear lungs. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top
normal. The mediastinal contours are notable only for tortuosity
of the thoracic aorta. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.

[**6-4**] MRI: Multiple foci of abnormal signal in the corpus
callosum, the largest is centered in the left splenium.  These
lesions demonstrate bright T2 FLAIR signal as well as mild slow
diffusion and are hypodense on CT.  MRI with contrast is
suggested for further characterization. Differential diagnosis
includes a metastatic disease with high cellularity, or
lymphoma.  A demyelinating process is much less likely.
  2.  Very limited MRA examination demonstrating possible severe
narrowing of the distal right M1 segment

[**6-4**] MRI with add'l sequences:  Multiple enhancing lesions along
the corpus callosum as described above as well as in the
suprasellar region, pineal gland, and right thalamus.
Differential diagnosis involves metastatic disease or lymphoma

CT chest/abd/pelvis [**6-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Heterogenous thyroid gland, which may be further evaluated
with ultrasound if clinically warranted.
2.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystit
