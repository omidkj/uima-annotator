Admission Date:  [**2167-8-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-8-19**]

Date of Birth:   [**2098-10-30**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
woman with chronic congestive heart failure, who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] with increasing dyspnea for the last two to
three months and associated orthopnea and pedal edema.  The
patient also had paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  The patient
denied any frank chest pressure or pain.  She was noted at
the outside hospital to have a chronic right lower lobe
effusion/infiltrate.  At the outside hospital the patient was
diuresed eight pounds, but remained in congestive heart
failure, and also had hyponatremia, which was resolving upon
transfer.  Additionally, the patient had hyperkalemia at the
outside hospital, which was resolved and ruled out for
Addison disease by a cortisol level.  The patient also
developed herpes zoster on [**2167-7-29**].  A stress
MIBI performed at the outside hospital showed left
ventricular dilation at rest and post Persantine, a large
inferior, posterior, lateral infarct without ischemia and
global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 24%.  The
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for further diuresis and intervention.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
in [**2161**] with PTCA and stent of the RCA.  There is evidence of
a previous posterior myocardial infarction and a new anterior
MI with a ejection fraction of 35% at that time.
2.  Cerebrovascular accident in [**2167-5-18**] with right-sided
weakness.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with chronic right
lower lobe infiltrate.  The patient has been treated for
pneumonia twice without resolution of the infiltrate.
4.  Mitral stenosis secondary to rheumatic fever.
5.  Atrial fibrillation for which the patient is on Coumadin.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 3 mg PO q.d.
2.  Digoxin 0.25 mg PO q.d.
3.  Lopressor 12.5 mg PO b.i.d.
4.  Capoten 12.5 mg PO b.i.d.
5.  Lasix 80 mg PO q.d.
6.  Lipitor 10 mg PO q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to AMOXICILLIN, WHICH
CAUSES ITCHING AND NAUSEA.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  The patient is
widowed.  Her daughter lives next door.  The patient walks
with a cane at home and uses two liters of oxygen.  She is
only able to walk a few steps without shortness of breath.
The patient quit smoking tobacco in [**2161**].  She has a greater
than 50 pack per year smoking history.  The patient denies
alcohol or drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There is no history of coronary artery
disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  The patient is an elderly
female resting in no acute distress.  Temperature 96.4, blood

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
White count 4.8, hematocrit 40.8, platelet count 153,000,
sodium 131, potassium 4.2, chloride 92, bicarbonate 35, BUN
28, creatinine 1.0, glucose 74, calcium 8.8.  EKG:  Atrial
fibrillation with a left bundle branch block.  Ventricular
rate of 71 beats per minute.  Chest x-ray:  Study performed
on [**2167-7-21**], showed right lower lobe infiltrate,
cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary vascular redistribution, right
small effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

#1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Upon transfer to the [**Hospital1 346**], the patient was taken to the
Coronary Catheterization Laboratory, which revealed on left
ventriculography 3+ mitral regurgitation, left ventricular
ejection fraction 25% with inferobasilar akinesis, anterior
apical severe hypokinesis.  In addition, the patient had a
30% in-stent narrowing within the mid RCA.  It was thought
that the patient's severe left ventricular dysfunction was
related to her prior infarction with likely additional
nonischemic cardiomyopathy.  The patient had nonsignificant
coronary artery disease with severe mitral regurgitation and
moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis.  Echocardiogram performed
on [**2167-8-7**] showed an ejection fraction less than
20% with left atrial and left ventricular dilation.  There
was left ventricular anteroseptal apical and inferior
akinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere and in the right
ventricular free wall.  There was 1+ AR, 3+ MR, 2+ TR and
moderate pulmonary artery hypertension with a small
pericardial effusion.  Because the patient was markedly
volume overloaded, status post catheterization and had
evidence of severe systolic left ventricular dysfunction, the
patient was diuresed aggressively with Lasix and Natrecor
drips.  Maximal diuresis achieved while on the hospital floor
was 800 cc a day. however, the patient remained grossly
volume overloaded and required more aggressive diuresis,
which was achieved upon transfer to the coronary care unit on
[**2167-8-8**].  While in the coronary care unit the
patient was continued on a Lasix and Natrecor drips.  The
patient was also started on Zaroxolyn for diuresis.  The
patient was diuresed approximately 8.5 liters during her four
day coronary care unit stay.  She was transferred out of the
coronary care unit on [**2167-8-15**] in stable
condition without any signs and symptoms of congestive heart
failure.  The patient's Natrecor and Zaroxolyn were
discontinued once the patient arrived to the floor and the
patient's Lasix dose, which changed to 120 mg PO q.d.  In
addition, the patient was started on Aldactone 25 mg PO q.d.
The patient was maintained on her cardiac regimen including
aspirin, statin, Captopril 12.5 mg PO t.i.d.,
Digoxin  0.125 mg PO q.d.  Although upon initial admission it
was thought that the patient may benefit from mitral valve
replacement repeat echocardiogram revealed that the patient's
mitral stenosis was not significant.  It was thought that the
patient would rather benefit from the placement of
biventricular implantable cardiac defibrillator with pacing
ability to improve the patient's cardiac input.  A
transesophageal echocardiogram performed on [**8-17**],
prior to placement of the biventricular ICD device, however,
revealed the presence of a left atrial appendage thrombus,
which precluded the cardioversion prior to placement of the
ICD device.  In addition, the ICD device could not be tested
given the presence of the thrombus.  The patient will need
the ICD device tested after four weeks of anticoagulation.
There were no complications after placement of the
biventricular device.  The patient remained in atrial
fibrillation with ventricular packing at 85 beats per minute
upon discharge.

In addition, throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, the
patient required heparin anticoagulation for her atrial
fibrillation, as well as for her apical akinesis.

The patient was restarted on a new heparin algorithm once the
ICD device was placed and the patient's Coumadin was again
restarted.  The goal INR is 2.5 go 3.0.  The patient will
require heparin until the patient's INR is greater than 2.0.
The patient will need her INR checked every week until a
repeat transesophageal echocardiogram is performed in six to
seven weeks.

In addition, given the patient's severe left ventricular
dysfunction, it was thought that the patient would highly
benefit from starting a beta blocker.  The patient was placed
on Carvedilol 3.125 mg PO b.i.d. with food once her
biventricular ICD device was placed.

PULMONARY:  The patient's COPD remained stable during her
hospital stay.  She received Albuterol and Ipratropium
nebulizers as needed.  The patient's oxygenation remained
stable at 98% to 99% on two liters upon discharge.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a urinalysis, which
showed trace leukocyte esterase and trace blood with 11 to 30
RBCs and 11 to 20 WBCs and few bacteria.  However, urine
culture revealed mix
