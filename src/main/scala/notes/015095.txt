HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old female who
has known mitral valve prolapse since [**2158**] and has begun to
experience increasing fatigue and shortness of breath times 3
months.  The patient was seen by her cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 25833**] and had an echocardiogram which revealed 2 plus AI,
moderate mitral valve prolapse with a torn chorda and a flail
leaflet, 4 plus mitral regurgitation, and [**1-22**] plus tricuspid
regurgitation.  The patient had a cardiac catheterization on
[**3-13**] which showed severe mitral regurgitation, normal
left ventricular function, and no coronary artery disease.
The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for mitral valve
repair.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation.
2. Glaucoma.
3. Status post left total hip replacement in [**2161**].
4. Status post bilateral vein stripping in [**2124**].


PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1. Timolol eye drops.
2. Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg po qd
3. Multivitamin
4. Citracal.


ALLERGIES:  NKDA.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a carotid ultrasound
preoperatively which showed no significant carotid or
vertebral artery disease.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted [**2165-4-26**] and
taken to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for a mitral
valve repair with resection of flail segment of the posterior
leaflet and placement of a 28 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] annuloplasty band.
Please see operative note for full details.  Total
cardiopulmonary bypass time 65 minutes.  Cross clamp time 45
minutes.  The patient was transported to the intensive care
unit in stable condition.  Shortly after arrival in the
intensive care unit, the patient developed rapid atrial
fibrillation.  Cardioversion was attempted times 2
unsuccessfully.  The patient was loaded with amiodarone, and
again cardioverted to sinus bradycardia and was atrially
paced.  The patient's hemodynamics during this time were
stable.  The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical
ventilation on the first postoperative day with an adequate
cardiac index.

On postoperative day 1, the patient's hematocrit was 24.3.
She was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells.  On
postoperative day 2, the patient again developed atrial
fibrillation.  An electrophysiology consult was obtained.  As
the patient's atrial fibrillation was alternating with sinus
bradycardia and junctional rhythm, electrophysiology
recommended low-dose oral amiodarone and slow addition of low-
dose beta blocker.  As patient had had multiple episodes of
bradycardia, they recommended following patient closely.
There was also concern at the time as the patient had
developed some elevated filling pressures that the patient
might possibly have a pericardial effusion and therefore, an
echocardiogram was obtained which showed preserved left
ventricular ejection fraction, no mitral regurgitation, no
pericardial effusion.  The patient's chest tubes remained in
as they continued to have a high amount of output.

Also, on postoperative day 2, a chest x-ray showed that the
patient had right lower lobe atelectasis and collapse.  The
patient underwent aggressive chest physiotherapy with
subsequent chest x-ray showing significant improvement.  The
patient continued to have episodes of rapid atrial
fibrillation alternating with sinus bradycardia.  The patient
tolerated these episodes well.  On postoperative day 2, the
patient's chest tubes were removed without incident.  The
patient began working with physical therapy.

On[**Last Name (STitle) 14810**]perative day 5, the patient was transferred from the
intensive care unit to the regular part of the hospital.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient was in sinus
bradycardia, and evening of postoperative day 5 the patient
was noted to have sinus bradycardia to the 40s.  At this
time, the Lopressor and amiodarone were discontinued.
Electrophysiology was again consulted and recommended holding
both the Lopressor and the amiodarone.  Over the course of
the next day, the patient's heart rate increased into the 50s
and 60s at rest and increasing to the 80s with ambulation.  A
discussion was had with electrophysiology at this time.  The
decision was made to hold the amiodarone and the Lopressor,
and discharge the patient to home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts
monitor to monitor for any signs of atrial fibrillation.  The
patient had been started on Coumadin, and after 2 doses of
Coumadin the patient's INR had risen to 2.8.  This was
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], and as the patient had been
in sinus rhythm-sinus bradycardia for several days, the
decision was made to hold the anticoagulation with the [**Doctor Last Name **]
of Hearts monitor.  If the patient had any further atrial
fibrillation , the anticoagulation would be restarted.  The
patient's pacing wires had been removed without incident, and
the patient ambulated with physical therapy, and by
postoperative day 6, the patient had been cleared for
discharge to home.  The patient was discharged to home on
postoperative day 7.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  T-max 98.3, pulse 56, sinus
bradycardia, blood pressure 127/78, respiratory rate 16, room
air oxygen saturation 96%.  White blood cell count 9.0,
hematocrit 27.5, platelet count 215, potassium 4.7, BUN 18,
creatinine 0.8.  The patient's weight on [**5-3**] was 63.9 kg.
The patient weighed 60 kg preoperatively.  Chest x-ray on
[**5-2**] showed no CHF and a small right effusion and a mildly
elevated left hemidiaphragm.  Neurologically, the patient is
awake, alert, oriented x 3.  Cardiovascular - regular rate
and rhythm without rub or murmur.  Respiratory - breath
sounds are clear bilaterally.  GI - positive bowel sounds,
soft, nontender, nondistended, tolerating a regular diet.
Sternal incision - Steri-Strips are intact.  Incision is
clean and dry.  There is no erythema.  No drainage.
Extremities - trace edema.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Mitral valve prolapse/mitral regurgitation.
2. Status post mitral valve repair.
3. Postoperative atrial fibrillation .
4. Postoperative sinus bradycardia.

1. Lasix 20 mg po qd times 7 days.
2. Potassium chloride 20 mEq po qd times 7 days.
3. Colace 100 mg po bid.
4. Protonix 40 mg po qd.
5. Dilaudid 2 mg po q 6 h prn.

7. Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg po qd.


DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged to home in
