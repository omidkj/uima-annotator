Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital3 5173**] for diffuse alveolar damage
requiring intubation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation x 2
Bronchoscopy with BAL
Percutaneous tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
46 yo F with h/o asthma and tob use presents from OSH intubated
for progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. Pt is currently
paralyzed and sedated.
.
Pt initially presented to [**Hospital3 5173**] on [**2111-12-21**] with 5-6
days of fevers to 101, cough productive of bloody sputum,
wheezing, and progressive SOB refractory to her inhalers. She
initially received Rocephin, Azithromax, SoluMedrol, and Nebs.
An HIV test was obtained.
.
Per OSH pulmonologist, Dr. [**Name (NI) 8260**], pt has had progressive dsypnea
x5-6 months requiring multiple admissions. SOB has been
partially responsive to steroids. CXR's over the last several
months revealed progressive b/l infiltrates, initially mostly at
the bases. CT scan from [**11-8**] revealed enlarged medistinal LN's;
CT scan from 1 yr prior with minimal mediastinal LAD. PFT's
revealed normal spirometry with minimally decreased lung volumes
c/w obesity. Bronchoscopy 1 yr ago was unremarkable.
.
Pt underwent an open pulmonary bx ([**2111-12-25**]). Path revealed
diffuse alveolar damage. Cx from lung biopsy (AFB, Mycoplasma,
PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]) were all negative. She was extubated 2 days
post-op. Chest tube removed [**12-28**].
.
Her respiratory status further deteriorated BiPAP and
reintubation. Since  [**12-21**] she has had a leukocytosis (WBC ~20)
thought to be secondary to high dose steroids. She has been
afebrile. She became hypotensive prior to transfer requiring
dopamine. Her initial gas revealed an acidosis that improved
with  increasing tidal volume.

CT Chest [**1-1**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Nonspecific widespread predominantly ground-glass opacities
in both lungs could be consistent with the history of diffuse
alveolar damage. Acute interstitial pneumonia, hypersensitivity,
drug toxicity, pulmonary edema and infection are within the wide
differential for the above findings.
2. Mediastinal adenopathy.
3. Small right pleural effusion.

ECHO [**1-1**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.  There is no pericardial effusion.

.
ECHO [**1-11**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color  Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high
cardiac output. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-1-1**],
the degree of TR and pulmonary hypertension detected has
decreased. The LVEF and RVEF remain normal to hyperdynamic.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR: [**2112-1-11**]:
An endotracheal tube and central venous catheter remain in
satisfactory position. A nasogastric tube is coiled within the
stomach. Cardiac contours are obscured by adjacent alveolar
process, limiting assessment of heart size. There has been
interval worsening of a diffuse bilateral alveolar process,
which relatively spares the extreme lung apices. The worsening
is more pronounced on the left than the right. Underlying
bilateral pleural effusions are likely but difficult to quantify
in the setting of diffuse lung disease.
.
CXR: [**1-15**]:
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in supine position and comparison is made with a similar
previous examination of [**2112-1-11**]. Position of ETT, NG
tube and right subclavian approach central venous line is
unchanged. Same holds for the previously described extensive
left-sided and right-sided basal parenchymal densities. New is
now the presence of a pneumothorax along the lower right-sided
lateral chest wall with a maximal width of about 2 cm.
Thickening of the parietal pleura is noted. The pneumothorax
does not extend into the apical area. It is suspected that a
thoracocentesis has been performed during the interval unless
the pneumothorax is spontaneous. Clinical correlation is
essential.
.
CXR [**2112-1-19**]:
Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema has worsened.
Small-to-moderate right hydropneumothorax, largely fluid is
stable since [**1-17**], collecting more fluid compared to
[**1-16**]. Heart is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal widening
reflects vascular engorgement. Tip of the right central venous
line projects over the right atrium. Tracheostomy tube has a
standard appearance.
