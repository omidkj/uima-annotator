Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5134**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 81 year old male who does not recall how he hit his
head and unknown loss of consciousness. He states that he "must
have hit his head somehow". He is unaccompanied by family and
amnestic to the event. He presented to [**Hospital6 2561**] and
had a Head Ct which was consistent with 2 x 2 x 4 cm right
posterior parietal intracerebral hemorrhage compressing the
right lateral ventricle. He was subsequently admitted to
Neurology, but was found to have a RLL PNA. He was noted to be
increasingly tachypnic and a CXR showed the known right sided
infiltrate. ABG showed acute respiratory alkalosis. He was
subsequently transferered to the MICU in setting of tachypnea.
While there, he was never intubed, and was on 2-4LNC+face tent
for a few days. The MICU started him on vanc/zosyn, and had
inititally added Levoflocacin after his urine legionella came
back positive. However, given the patient's IC bleed and risk
for seizure, the patient was switched to vanc/zosyn/azithro. The
patient is on prophylaxis for seizure because of his new head
bleed, but he does not have a history of seizure. His dosing for
vanc/zosyn/azithro x10days, starting on [**9-4**]. Patient was noted
during ICU stay to have decreased urine output in addition to
slight hematuria. Subsequently the Foley was DC'ed and a large
clot was discovered which had been occluding the foley.
Subsequently the patient has been placed on a 3-way foley for
irrigation.
.
The patient's mental status during his hospital stay was notable
for waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, delirium at night,
hallucinating, though now has drastically improved - improved to
baseline by today.
.
Neuro wants MRI to evaluate for AVM vs amyloid that could make
him more likely to bleed because they feel that the position of
bleed may not be secondary to fall. There is some theory that he
could have had intra-parenchymal bleed first follow by the fall.
His vital signs in the ICU were afebrile since [**9-5**] afternoon,
HR 80s BP 110s-140s O2sat 92-98% on 3L NC.

Labs on Discharge:

Imaging:
CT HEAD: CT head performed earlier the same day at [**Hospital3 60734**]
was available for review prior to interpretation.

FINDINGS: Non-contrast head CT was performed. There is a right
temporoparietal intraparenchymal hematoma measuring
approximately 3.6 x 3.0 x 1.7 cm, with minimal surrounding
parenchymal edema. There is moderate amount of subarachnoid
blood seen in the right temporoparietal sulci as well. There is
no subdural or epidural hematoma identified, and no
intraventricular extension. Of note, there is no subarachnoid
blood seen in the basal cisterns or right sylvian fissure.
Elsewhere, the brain appears normal without further foci of
hemorrhage, and without mass effect or parenchymal edema. There
is no CT evidence of acute territorial infarction. There is some
mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle from the
aforementioned hematoma, but there is no significant shift of
midline structures, and the basal cisterns are preserved. There
is no hydrocephalus. There are no calvarial or skull base
fractures identified.  There is a mucus retention cyst seen
anteriorly within the right maxillary sinus, with some mild
mucosal thickening circumferentially, but there are no air-fluid
levels to suggest occult fractures. Mucosal thickening is also
seen in the ethmoid air cells. The mastoids are well aerated.
The extracranial soft tissues are notable for
contusion/laceration over the occiput, but otherwise
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with
associated
overlying subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right temporal and
parietal sulci. No subarachnoid hemorrhage is seen in the basal
cisterns or sylvian fissure. Given the history of trauma, this
is most likely post-traumatic.
2. Mild mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle, with no
shift of
midline structures or evidence of herniation.
3. No calvarial or skull base fractures are identified.

[**9-3**] CXR: Patchy consolidation within the right mid and right
lower lung has slightly worsened with less visibility of the
right hemidiaphragm. This may reflect an evolving aspiration
pneumonia considering the provided history of this diagnosis.
Review of recent CT of [**2170-9-2**], confirms extensive
consolidation throughout the right lower lobe. Remainder of
lungs are grossly clear. IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia.


CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2170-9-3**] 3:31 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged right temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage,
adjacent
subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage.
2. Bifrontal subdural hemorrhage has decreased in density
compared to the
prior.
3. Unchanged mild effacement of the right lateral ventricle. No
evidence of
herniation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2170-9-3**] 5:21 AM
IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia.
