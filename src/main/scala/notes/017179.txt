NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN: There is a large intraparenchymal
hemorrhage centered at the right putamen, which extends into the
right lateral ventricle and the third ventricle, with reflux
into the left lateral ventricle. The large intraparenchymal
hemorrhage produces mass effect on the right lateral ventricle,
with perhaps 1-2 mm of shift of the normally midline structures
right to left. There is hypodensity of the brain parenchyma
surrounding the hemorrhage. In addition, there is hypodensity
diffusely within the cerebral periventricular white matter,
consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation appears preserved. The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. Osseous and
soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Large right putaminal hemorrhage, extending into the
lateral ventricles, likely hypertensive. There is approximately
1-2 mm of shift of the normally midline structures.

Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23804**] in the emergency department
on the morning of [**2166-2-24**].

REPEAT HEAD CT [**2-25**]:

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Comparison with [**2166-2-24**]. Again seen
is an intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right basal
ganglia, with extension into the right frontal lobe, right
parietal lobe, and right temporal lobe. It has slightly
increased in size. Additionally, in addition to the blood
layering along the right lateral ventricle, there is extension
into the left lateral ventricle, with a small amount of layering
blood in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], and third ventricle. Cisterns
otherwise remain patent, and there is no interval change in the
size of the ventricles. This study is extremely limited by
motion, however, hypodensity surrounding the intraparenchymal
hemorrhage can be seen, representing edema, which exerts
unchanged mild mass effect shifting the septum pellucidum to the
left. Additionally, there is extensive hypodensity in the left
periventricular and subcortical white matter. Visualized sinuses
are clear. No fractures are identified. No definite subdural
blood is seen.

IMPRESSION: Slight interval increase in size of right-sided
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with new extension of blood into
the left lateral ventricle.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Neuro ICU with a right thalamic
bleed (estimated at 35cc) with extension into the lateral
ventricle.  He was seen by neurosurgery and neurology as a "code
stroke" (initial NIHSS score 16); for INR 2.3 he received
proplex and FFP.  He required more FFP later when his INR was
still found to be high.  In the ED, the patient's initial BP was
150/98, HR 108, afebrile.  Initial exam was significant for a
left neglect to visual and tactile stimulation, left homonomous
hemianopsia versus neglect, right gaze preference with rarely
crossing the midline, left arm weakness (proximal and distal
2-3/5) with full right arm strength, left leg weakness (also
2-3/5), brisk reflexes (absent at ankles), with bilaterally
upgoing toes.  The bleed was felt to be most likely related to
hypertension, though underlying mass, vascular anomaly were also
in differential.  Anticoagulation was held as were antiplatelet
agents.  Blood pressure was kept under 140 goal systolic, tight
blood glucose control was initiated with ISS for ICU level of
care, prophylaxis was initiated with pneumoboots and protonix.
The patient developed a cough and transient episodes of
tachypnea (which apparently happened at home as well); he had a
chest xray which revealed a right lower lobe pneumonia, mild
CHF, and left lower lobe atelectasis.  The patient remained
sleepy while in the ICU but arousable.  On [**2-26**], he was sleepier
than he had been and a head CT w
