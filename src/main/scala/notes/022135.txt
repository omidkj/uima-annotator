History of Present Illness:
History obtained from medical record and patient. 75 yo man with
history of CHF (EF 15%), afib on coumadin, CAD s/p MI, diabetes,
HTN, presented from rehab [**5-30**] with altered mental status after
recent [**Hospital1 18**] admit [**Date range (1) 20648**] for RLL pna. He had been
discharged to rehab on [**5-27**] ([**Hospital1 **] in [**Location (un) 701**]), to
complete a 7-day course of vanco/zosyn (last day was to be [**6-1**]).
He became increasingly combative and confused at rehab with
lethargy. Per Rehab records, patient was noted to have some
confusion on [**2112-5-28**]. On [**2112-5-29**] he had a new roommate in his
room, who per nursing report was confrontational with the
patient. Mr. [**Known lastname 20649**] lost a night of sleep and was noted to
subsequently have increasing agitation and confusion.
Unfortunately, he was given 2mg IV Ativan for his confusion, and
continued to be agitated- and became a verbal and physical
threat to the staff, requiring administration of a Posey. He was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-30**] for altered mental status. Per
report his daughter noted visual hallucinations for a few weeks
prior to admit on risperdal (new med).

In the ED to 101.8 rectal and was admitted to the ICU out of
concern for sepsis (given WBC 14.8) with altered mental status
and lactate of 2.3. Presumed source for infection was persistent
pneumonia. He was given meropenum x2 doses only then continued
on vanco/zosyn to complete the original course with the addition
of azithromycin. He defervesced after admit. Duloxetine and
risperdal were held on this admission given mental status
change. Currently he is confussed, but does know he is in [**Location (un) 86**]
in a hospital ([**Hospital1 756**]), not why he is in the hospital.  He
notes cough but no other complaints.

Review of his record reveals he was never restarted on an ace
inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **] after last discharge. Prior dose reportedly
10mg of diovan daily (?), prior noted to be 20mg.

Review of systems: He complains of cough and choking on food but
all other review of systems extensively (10 systems) negative.

Radiology
Head CT [**6-1**]: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
Mild-to-moderate chronic small vessel ischemic disease. If there
is a clinical suspicion for an acute infarction, then MRI would
be a more sensitive study.

CXR portable [**5-30**]: Continued improvement of right lower lobe
pneumonia.
CXR [**5-31**]: Moderate pulmonary edema.
[**2112-6-2**]   Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT)
General improvement of chest findings, marked improvement of
previously identified pulmonary congestion and central edema
pattern. Some
bilateral basal infiltrates persist and further followup is
recommended.

[**2112-6-2**] Bedside Swallow Evaluation
SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:
PO trials included ice chips, thin liquids via tsp/cup, nectar
thick liquids via tsp/cup, bites of puree. Oral phase was mildly
prolonged with no oral residue remaining. Laryngeal elevation
felt adequate to palpation. Wet vocal quality and immediate wet
breathing noted with thin liquids followed by coughing. Delayed
cough and audible wet breathing noted on all further trials of
nectar thick liquid and puree. Patient denied the sensation of
food or liquid stuck in his throat or going down the wrong way,
but did report several instances where he said he needed to
cough.

SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20649**] presents with lethargy, generalized weakness, and s/sx
of aspiration on all consistencies trialed at the bedside as
evidenced by wet vocal quality, wet breathing immediately after
swallow and immediate and delayed reflexive coughing. Recommend
patient remain NPO at this time. Team to monitor and decide on
tube feeds as indicated over the weekend. Recommend
