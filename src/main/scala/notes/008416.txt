History of Present Illness:
55 year old male h/o CAD, DM, HTN, CKD who presents to ER with
acute SOB. Patient states he was feeling his normal self until
approximately 6:00pm today when he began to experience nausea,
diaphoresis and SOB. His children were concerned and called 911.
The symptoms resolved in the ER. Patient denies any chest
discomfort or dizziness during the episode. Patient reports 4
weeks of sub-sternal "heart burn" with exertion, which he
thought could also be musculoskeletal related to climbing into
his new truck. He describes this pain as a band-like tightness
[**4-13**]. Of note patient discontinued all of his home medications
(other than insulin) because he felt they caused his weight
gain. Patient has baseline 2 pillow orthopnea and intermittent
lower extremity edema (not worsened recently). Denies PND,
syncope, pre-syncope.
.
On review of systems, denies stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were HR 121, BP 240/110, RR 38, 97%
RA. Patient continued to be hypertensive in ER and was started
on Nitro ggt. Glucose was 603, no ketones. Patient received ASA,
Lasix 40 mg IV, Nitro ggt, Lopressor 5mg IV, Ativan 1 mg and
Insulin 10 Units. Admitted to CCU.

Cardiac Cath [**2186-10-27**] 1. Coronary angiography of this right
dominant system revealed 3 vessel and left main disease
unsuitable for PCI. The LMCA had an 80% stenosis distally at the
bifurcation of the LAD and LCX. The LAD had mild disease in the
previously placed proximal stent and moderate mid-segment
disease. The LCX had an 80% ostial stenosis with an 80% stenosis
proximally in a high OM1. The RCA had a 50% stenosis in the
mid-segment and an 80% stenosis in the proximal right
posterolateral branch. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed
severely elevated systemic arterial pressure despite a
nitroglyercine IV drip with an SBP of 181 mm Hg. The LVEDP was
also elevated at 25 mm Hg suggestive of severe diastolic
dysfunction. There was no gradient suggestive of aortic stenosis
with pullback across the aortic valve. 3. Left ventriculography
given renal insufficiency.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

ECHO [**2186-10-27**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Prominent symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Dilated thoracic aorta.
These findings are c/w hypertensive heart.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of [**2179-6-22**], prominent left ventricular hypertrophy is now
identified.

[**2186-10-30**] ECHO
PRE BYPASS:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus
level. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST BYPASS:
Left and right ventricular function is preserved. The aorta is
intact. The study is unchanged.
