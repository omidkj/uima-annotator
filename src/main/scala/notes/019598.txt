Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Morphine / Penicillins / Clindamycin / Tricor / Ambien

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased lethargy, fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
89 yo female with PMH of dementia, HTN, CAD, COPD, PEx 4 on
chronic anticoagulation, CRI, and AAA s/p endovascular repair
one month ago who was transferred from her NH today w/ new onset
of lethargy. By report, patient had 3 wk h/o fevers, starting
[**2135-8-20**], with unclear source. Sacral decubitus ulcer debrided on
[**8-19**], and fevers began the following day. Was started on
macrobid for ? UTI on [**8-22**]. Urine cx on [**8-23**] found MRSA in urine
-> treated empirically with levaquin and macrobid. On
speciation, it was found to be MRSA and her abx were switched to
vancomycin. Fevers persisted and wound cx on [**8-27**] grew MRSA. Pt
began to have daily fevers at night (Tmax 101.6) accompanied by
altered mental status. Blood cultures from [**8-30**] and [**8-31**] were
negative, but on blood cx from [**9-1**] grew gram positive cocci.
.
On exam, the patient has no complaints other than her fevers.
She denies any SOB, CP, headaches, dizziness, feeling confused,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools, dark/tarry stools,
BRBPR, dysuria, hematuria, nuchal rigidity, or photophobia. +
for several episodes of "chills" at the NH.
.
In the ED, T was 103.9, BP 112/66, HR 88, RR 18 and sats were
94% on RA. She appeared somnolent, delerious and diaphoretic.
She was started on the sepsis protocol and a central line and
foley catheter were placed. Her BP began to drop, with a low of
62/26, and she was given 3L of NS but levophed was eventually
started to support her BP. Her UOP was also poor, with 10 cc/2
hours. A CXR was performed which showed no signs of infiltrate.
Urine and blood cultures were sent. She was given vanco,
ceftriaxone and flagyl for empiric coverage.
.
