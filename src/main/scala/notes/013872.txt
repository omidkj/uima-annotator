Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Elongated LA. No
spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA. No spontaneous
echo contrast in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. Dilated
coronary sinus (diameter >15mm).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Low normal LVEF. [Intrinsic LV
systolic function likely depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Moderately dilated
ascending aorta. Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal
aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. AR vena contracta is <0.3cm.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Torn
mitral chordae. MR vena contracta is >=0.7cm Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
No PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions

Pre Bypass: Tehcnical qulality is poor, especially limiting the
utility of transgastric images. The left atrium is moderately to
severely dilated and elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
The right atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The coronary sinus is dilated
(diameter >15mm), but infusion of agitated saline through left
arm results in normal flow pattern (no evidence for presistent
left SVC). There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
borderine moderately dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Multiple torn
mitral chordae are present. The anterior mitral leaflet has
partial prolapse around A2. The annulus is dilated (4.8cm on
average). The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is systolic flow
reversal in the left upper pulmonary vein.

Post bypass: Preserved biventricular function, LVEF 50%. Image
quality still limits ability to assses focal wall motion. There
is a bioprosthetic mitral valve insitu. Mean gradients are [**3-4**]
mm Hg. Initial tiny perivalvular leaks disappeared with
administration of protamine. Ultimately, no regurgitation or
perivalvular leaks were seen. AI is still mild, as is TR.
Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with
surgeons at the time of the exam.

NOTE: on review of ENCORE images, a large portion of the pre
bypass study images did not upload, including all of the
transgastric prebypass images.




Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on [**1-12**] where he underwent a
CABG x 4 and MVR. He was transferred to the ICU in critical but
stable condition. He was extubated later that same day. He was
transferred to the floor on POD #1. He remained in atrial
fibrillation.  Coumadin started / INR followed. On Dc 1.7 Ct
tubes removed POD # 2. Post X-Ray no sequela, POD # 3 PW removed
no sequela. Continued with PT. Pt clears for home. Pt stable

Coumadin to be follwed as outpt with primary care physician
