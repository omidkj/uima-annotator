Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress, PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Cardiac Catherization

History of Present Illness:
75 year old male with past medical history of HTN, HLD, CAD,
DMII and COPD who became progressively dyspneic and fatigued
starting last night.  This morning the patient was gasping for
air and his wife called 911. [**Name2 (NI) **] was transported to [**Hospital 6451**] Medical Center.  On arrival to ED at OSH patient was
in respiratory distress and intubated. Patient was found to have
PEA, received epinephrine and converted to SVT, and received
lidocaine. He was then noted to be in AF with RVR in the 150s
and was cardioverted with 200 J x 1 biphasic sync shock. The
patient's EKG revealed q waves and ST elevation in III and aVF
with widespread ST depression.

Patient was taken for an emergent catherization. Catherization
showed LAD 80% mid lesion, occluded posterior lateral, 70-80%
occulsion of the PDA, and 50% OM1. No intervention was performed
in outside cath lab and patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for
definitive treatment of CABG vs. PCI.

Imaging:

Echo [**10-9**] (Please see chart for further details)
The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to severe
hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls with inferobasal
and posterobasal ANEURYSM.

MRI: [**2121-10-11**]
Findings indicative of diffuse hypoxic injury to the brain along

with several foci of acute infarcts involving both cerebellum
and right
periatrial region. No hemorrhage is seen.

Studies: [**2121-10-13**]
This is an abnormal continuous EEG continuous low voltage
suppressed background. This record is worse compared to the
previous
tracing due to the disappearance of GPED activity and severe
diffuse
background attenuation. While there is no definite evidence of
cerebral
activity, this study was not performed according to ACNS
guidelines for
electrocerebral inactivity and, therefore, cannot be used as a
confirmatory test for the determination of brain death.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old man with respiratory distress requiring intubation
at OSH s/p PEA arrest, SVT, and AF with RVR now in Sinus rhythm
who underwent cooling protocol.
.
In brief, the patient initially presented to an OSH with
respiratory distress resulting in respiratory distress requiring
intubation.  At the time he developed PEA arrest necessitating
medications and DC cardioversion.  His ECG demonstrated ST
depressions and elevations necessitating emergent
catheterization.  Cauterization showed LAD 80% mid lesion,
occluded posterior lateral, 70-80% occlusion of the PDA, and 50%
OM1. No intervention was performed in outside cath lab and
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for definitive treatment of CABG
vs. PCI.  He was then cooled per the artic sun protocol.
.
His hospital course was complicated by hypotension, seizure
activity, and acute on chronic renal failure secondary to ATN.
An MRI demonstrated diffuse anoxic brain injury and his neuro
exam suggestive minimal function above brainstem activity.  His
goals of care was discussed with his wife, and [**Name2 (NI) **] measures
were initiated  after the endotracheal tube was pulled.  The
patient expired several hours after extubation on a morphine
drip.
