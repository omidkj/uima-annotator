**NOTE - this discharge summary reflects only the medical care
that this pt. recieved while under the care of the Hospitalist
Attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from [**4-19**] through discharge on [**4-21**]**

85 F h/o HTN, dCHF (EF=55-60%), [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
surgical treatment of mass at splenic flexure discovered on
sigmoidoscopy after small LGIB, likely adenoca.  Upon arrival,
pt underwent colonoscopy [**4-11**], biopsy showed adenocarcinoma.
Plan made for resection, pt seen by med/[**Female First Name (un) **] service pre-op, who
noted rales bilaterally, 2L O2 requirement, treated with
perioperative BB, taken to OR on [**3-/2112**] for hemicolectomy which
was completed succesfully (EBL= , pt received 600cc IVF).  Pt
also seen by heme-onc for leukopenia, felt [**3-19**] infection and
likely malignancy.
.
Post-operatively, she was extubated, however, ABG=6.84/193/157,
c/w hypercarbic respiratory failure, felt [**3-19**] sedation.  She was
reintubated, and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after failing to extubate.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was awake and alert, and was
extubated.
.
.
Of note, pt recently hospitalized at OSH [**Date range (1) 56895**] for UTI, PNA,
course c/b hypotension, bradycardia thought to be due to
dehydration/sepsis.  Pt's diuretics and BB were d/c'd due to
hypotension/bradycardia, which resolved.  She also developed
pancytopenia which was presumed related to medication
related(zosyn/levoflox) vs. myelosuprression from her underlying
infection. She was switched to azithromycin, completed 6 day
course. Her counts improved.  She received 1UPRBC for anemia,
HCT 32 at time of discharge, her Aspirin was held and was placed
on lovenox for DVT ppx.  Pt was also noted to be significantly
malnourished, albumin 2.2 and was started on TPN.
.
Pt was subsequently sent to rehab where she had an episode of
bloody BM, readmitted to OSH where simoidoscopy noted
circumferential mass, bx was c/w Adenoca as detailed above.  pt
therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

The review of the history up to this point is obtained from
review of the medical record.

For further detail of the hospital course from admission [**4-8**]

Hospital course

Complicated eldelry woman with a history of underlying
hypertension, cognitive impairment and newly diagnosed colonic
adenocarcinoma, s/p hemicoloectomy with primary anastamosis on
[**3-/2112**].  Her post-op course was complicated initially by
hypercarbic respiratory failure attributed to
hypoventilation/CO2 narcosis, necessitating a short ICU course
where she was successfully extubated and sent to 12 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**].
Since arrival to the floor, there have been problems with her
urine output bringing about some isotonic volume boluses
resulting in total body overload.

Medicine was consulted for oligouria and found the patient to
clinically have significant left-sided heart failure with use of
her accessory muscles and hypoxemia (low 90's on 2L).  Chest
X-ray confirms this. Upon review of her EKGs, it appears she has
also had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation likely accounting in
part for her decompensation.

She is thus transferred to the Medicine service for ongoing
treatment and evaluation.

## Diastolic Heart Failure with Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation
--Rate controlled with beta blockade
--12 lead EKG and troponin without evidence of ischemia or
atrial fibrillation
--diuresed approximately 3 litres [**Date range (1) 9238**] with clinical
improvement (RR down, wheezing diminished, pt. no longer
complaining of sob)
--hydralazine 10 mg IV q6 hrs and isordil 10 mg po tid
--discussed anticoagulation with pt.s daughter, re: atrial
fibrillation.  Decided jointly to resume aspirin only and not to
anticoagulate given fall risk and risk of bleeding given recent
surgery.  81 mg asa re-initiated after discussing with surgery
team, who agreed this was safe.

# Colonic Adenocarcinoma s/p succesful distal-transverse
colectomy - lymph nodes negative for involvement in pathology.
In discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**], she will see pt. in follow up to
discuss with pt. and family if they want to pursue surveillance
for recurrence, which is unclear given pt.s age.
.
-- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] would like to see pt. in follow up within one
month.
.
# UTI -s/p treatment with ampicillin for enterococcal UTI [**4-9**]
--repeat UA negative.  Foley d/c'd and pt. voided.
.
# h/o TIA
--ASA resumed as above
.
# dementia - mental status at baseline at time of d/c
