History of Present Illness:
HPI:   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with h/o CHF, a. fib,
s/p MIx2, s/p MVAs, h/o TIAs, fell at home after slipping and
falling on her right hip in the kitchen.  Taken to [**Hospital1 **] noted to have right femur fracture and was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for ORIF.  In the ambulance given morphine became
hypotensive Upon arrival to the ED, she was given 3 LNS.  Her
INR was found to be 3.4, so she was given 2 units FFP and
Vitamin K.  She was hypotensive and unresponsive and there was
concern for septic shock versus hemorrhagic shock (due to hip
fracture).  She was given one dose os vanco/ceftriaxone and 3L
IVF.  He received narcan 0.4mg..  She later got dilaudid and
toradol for pain control.
.
She was admitted to the TICU ahd her course is outlined below.
#  Respiratory failure - She was initially intubated on [**9-18**] for
airway protection and started on fentanyl/versed drip.  After
going to the OR on [**9-20**], the drips were stopped.  She remained
minimally responsive until receiving flumazenil on ? with
improvement.  After discussion with family planned for
extubation and no reintubation.  Underwent succesful extubation
on [**9-23**] at 11AM.
.
# Hypotension.  She required pressors (phenylephrine) during icu
course until [**9-21**], likely due to blood loss as a result of the
surgery in addition to lasix drip and beta blocker use for A.
Fib rate control.
.
# A. Fib. Patient initially in A. Fib with RVR.  She was given
metoprolol PRN but this contributed to hypotension, so was given
IV Digoxin.  Currently not on digoxin due to ?elevated digoxin
levels and is on standing metoprolol 25 tid at time of transfer.
.
# Right femur fracture.  On [**9-18**], she underwent traction pin.
On  [**9-19**], R femur CMN. On [**9-23**], the wound was found to have a
large amount of [**Last Name (LF) 74594**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] it was sutured with 2 nylons.
.
Upon arrival to the floor from the ICU on [**9-28**], patient is
minimally interactive and so unable to elicit further history.

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam:
Vitals: Tm 98.1 Tc96.1, 116/50 (100-142/50-80), HR 81 (70-98),
RR 24, O2 94%3L
General: lying in bed sleeping, NGT present
HEENT: temporal wasting, dry mucous membranes
Pulm: CTA anteriorly, no wheezes or crackles
CV: RRR, normal S1, S1, no murmurs/rubs/gallops
Abd: soft, NT, ND, bowel sounds present
ext: no LE edema
Neuro: minimally responsive


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**9-24**].  Severe cardiomegaly with particular left atrial
enlargement is longstanding.  Consolidation in the right mid
lung which arose between [**9-20**] and 23 has improved
consistent with clearing pneumonia.  Mild generalized
interstitial abnormality and low lung volumes are longstanding.
Pulmonary edema if present is minimal and not appreciably
changed recently.
.
Echo [**9-24**].  IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with preserved systolic function.  These findings
are suggestive of a primary pulmonary process (chronic or acute
on chronic; COPD, pulmonary embolism, bronchospasm, etc.).
.
Right Hip Films [**9-18**].  Acute, comminuted, spiral fracture of the

proximal right femoral shaft, with varus angulation.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with CAD, HTN, s/p CVAs,
A.Fib, dementia s/p Right femur fracture whose post-op course
was complicated by prolonged intubation secondary to altered
mental status.
.
Hip Fracutre.  Patient underwent intramedullary nailing of right
hip on [**9-19**].  She remained intubated for several days following
surgery, likely due to accumulation of benzodiazepines after
being on a Versed drip for several days and pulmonary edema due
to fluid overload.  She improved with diuresis and flumazenil
and was eventually extubated.  Her staples at Right hip will
need to be removed on post-op day 14 ([**2109-10-4**]).
.
Altered Mental status.  Patient was intially minimally
responsive only to sternal rub, however, she improved with
flumazenil.  She may be have an infection (?Aspiration
pneumonia) which may have contributed to her mental status.  She
was put on standing tylenol (rather than opioids) for pain
control.  Upon discharge, she was speaking intermittently and
more alert.
.
Possible aspiration pneumonia.  Patient is unable to clear her
oral secretions well.  Her WBC was rising and her oxygen
requirements were increasing.  She was started on Zosyn/ Vanco
for presumed aspiration pneumonia.  Course is scheduled to be
completed on [**10-3**], however these were stopped because the
decision was made to make her comfort measures only care.

Nutrition.  Patient is malnurished with most recent albumin of
2.1.   Was seen by speech and swallow on [**9-24**] and again on [**9-30**]
who recommended NPO with NG tube and tube feeding.  Tube feeds
were continued until [**10-2**], when the decision was made to make
patient hospice care.
.
DNR/DNI.  The family decided to send patient to hospice.  Would
recommend that patient get Roxonal and sublingual ativan for
shortness of breath or discomfort.
