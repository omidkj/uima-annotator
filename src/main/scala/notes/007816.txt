Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4057**]
Chief Complaint:
LLQ pain, presented for chemotherapy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
Intra aortic ballon pump
Bare metal stent placement (x 2)
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 73 y.o male with h.o NHL, CHF with EF 30%, AS, ESRD on
HD MWF, afib, DM2, hypogammuloglobulinema who presents with LLQ
abdominal pain. Per patient he has been doing okay since his
discharge to rehab earlier this month but over this past weekend
felt overall unwell. He developed LLQ pain that radiates around
left side to back, similar in nature to the pain he had during
his last admission that was felt to be d/t mesenteric/RP
lymphadenopathy and responded well to chemotherapy. Pain can be
[**10-24**] at times, but responds to oxycodone. No other abdominal
pain, nausea, emesis, melena, hematochezia, diarrhea, or
constipation. Also feels completely worn out, fatigued, with a
decreased appetite and feels like 'my whole body is exploding'.
Concerned that his cancer is progressing and was sent from rehab
for evaluation and chemotherapy.
.
Recently admitted [**Date range (1) 101001**] for chest pain and was found to
have unstable angina with stenosis of LAD and PDA at cath, s/p
BMS. He also had enlarging supraclavicular and cervical lymph
nodes and back pain and had evidence of rapidly progressive
lymphoma on CT with concern for high grade transformation. He
received IV dexamethasone, Oncovin ([**12-3**]) and Bendamustine
([**12-3**]), and Rituximab ([**12-4**]). His chemotherapy was complicated
by pancytopenia for which he was started on neupogen, tumor
lysis for which he received allopurinol and rasburicase, and
febrile neutropenia of unknown etiology treated with vanc/zosyn.

.
In ED, SBPs 80-90s (one [**Location (un) 1131**] in 70s), HR 102, 19, 97% 3L NC.
Received 250 mL fluid, although upon arrival to floor 1L bag
hanging at 250cc/hr and nearly finished. CXR showed resolving
CHF.

Past Medical History:
1. Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, slowly progressive (follicular
low-grade B-cell NHL grade I, diagnosed in [**2142**]), on
Bendemustine with partial response, has had recurrence on other

meds, over past month or so palpable lymphadenopathy seems to
have returned
2. Congestive heart failure likely secondary to combination of
moderate aortic stenosis and adriamycin cardiomyopathy EF 30%;
EFs have been improving recently, have been as low as 25% in
past
3. Aortic Stenosis (moderate)
4. End-stage kidney disease on HD MWF (secondary to diabetic
nephropathy; has had trauma to one kidney in childhood)
5. Atrial fibrillation, recently diagnosed
6. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (on glipizide)
7. Gout
8. Meningioma
9. Spinal stenosis- s/p surgery [**51**] yrs ago
10. Osteoarthritis of the hips s/p b/l THR
11. hypogammaglobulinemia (gets monthly IVIG)

EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Intraventricular
conduction delay. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous
tracing of [**2150-12-8**] the P-R interval is shorter. Differences in
precordial R wave progression may be related to lead position,
seen better on the present study.
.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm, rate 99, with first degree A-V block.
Left axis
deviation. Intraventricular conduction delay of left
bundle-branch block type.
Cannot exclude anteroseptal and/or inferior myocardial
infarction of
indeterminate age. Borderline left atrial abnormality. Compared
to the
previous tracing of [**2150-12-16**] R waves are markedly diminished
across the
anterior precordium consistent with possible interval anterior
myocardial
infarction. Clinical correlation is suggested. Also, first
degree A-V block
is new.
.
CXR PA/LAT [**1-5**]
No evidence of new infiltrates.
.
CXR [**1-11**]
1. Increased left basilar consolidation. Elevated left
hemidiaphragm with
probable elevated stomach bubble beneath. However, gas in the
pleural space cannot be excluded on this single-view exam. If
there is clinical concern for empyema or other cause of gas in
the pleural space, further evaluation with PA and lateral
radiographs or with chest CT would be recommended.
2. Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 year-old gentleman with history of ESRD on HD, chronic sCHF
(EF 30%), moderate to severe AS (valve area 0.9), CAD with BMS
to RCA on [**2150-11-27**], recent NSTEMI on [**2150-12-7**], and B-cell
lymphoma with recent chemotherapy with vincritine and rituximab
c/b tumor-lysis syndrome presents for chemo with symptoms of LLQ
pain consistent with prior lymphoma symptoms.
.
Patient presented with LLQ pain thought [**2-16**] progressive
lymphoma.  This pain was improved with chemotherapy, but after 1
day of chemo his course was complicated by hospital-acquired
pneumonia, as well as cardiac pain found to be an anterior STEMI
requiring IABP placement and multiple stents to the LAD.
Although at baseline the patient had low SBP (100s-110s),
following his cardiac intervention and CCU stay his SBPs began
to gradually deteriorate over the course of the next week.
Initially this resulted in no changes in mental status and did
not interfere with HD, but eventually once his SBPs began to dip
into the high 60s, Nephrology felt that they could not proceed
with HD and the patient began to have transient episodes of
confusion.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient's oncologist, agreed with
this assessment and felt that there was no other medical
treatment for his NHL that could be offered in his present
state.  Discussion was held with family that [**Hospital 228**] medical
condition was rapidly deteriorating.  After discussion, pt was
made DNR/DNI.  The patient expired in the early hours on [**1-20**], [**2151**].
