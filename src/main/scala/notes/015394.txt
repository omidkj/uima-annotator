Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy [**2109-10-5**]. Intubation [**2109-10-5**]. Triple lumen central
venous catheter [**2109-10-5**].


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 48 year-old female with PMHx of DMII, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, restrictive lung pattern, hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, who presents with 3 day history of progressive
shortness of breath, PND, and orthopnea. Pt says that for the
past week, she has noticed an increasing dyspnea on exertion,
now even at rest. Her stable [**4-19**] pillow orthopnea has increased,
though pt unable to say by how much. She is usually able to walk
10 feet without getting SOB, now gets SOB with minimal exertion.
No fever except for today. +cough x 1 day productive of clear
[**Month/Day (3) **]. +nausea x 1 day, no vomiting. + right sided rib pain
which is worse when coughing. No CP. No PND. Of note, pt says
that her weight has increased to 199 lbs in the past few weeks
from a normal documented dry weight of 183 lbs. Also, with
increasing ankle edema this week. ADmits to dietary
non-compliance and eating high salt foods.

In the ambulance VS were: RR 44, O2 Sat 82% on RA. She received
60 IV lasix, 4 ntg sprays, and aspirin and was placed on oxygen.
In the ED, her oxygen sat was 87% on 10 L face mask, BP 167/72
so NTG gtt was started. EKG was notable for sinus 92 bpm with
occ PACs, ST elevations in V1-V2, and new TWI V4-V6. She was
given one dose of levaquin for probable pneumonia in the setting
of an increased lactate to 4.1, WBC to 19.6 with a left shift.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 48 year-old woman with obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes
mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, asthma
who presented with community acquired pneumonia and developed
ARDS requiring intubation.

1. Dyspnea/respiratory failure:
Initially thought to be secondary to CHF, however then became
apparent that patient had bilateral atypical community acquired
pneumonia. Patient required BIPAP with occasional desaturations
with movement. Patient began to produce rusty [**Month/Day/Year **] and was
intubated on [**2109-10-5**] due to hypoxic respiratory failure. Patient
was temporarily on pressor support. She had diffuse bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates with CVP of 2 consistent with ARDS. She
developed a ventilator associated pneumonia as evidenced by a
worsening CXR with possible right infiltrate, worsening
respiratory status, elevated wbc, low grade temperature and pink
secretions. Vancomycin and zosyn were started for VAP. She was
difficult to wean due to hypotension. She responded to albumin
for volume rescusitation. Patient improved and was extubated on
[**2109-10-13**].

3. Pneumonia: Patient was started on ceftriaxone and levaquin
for treatment of community acquired pneumonia. Bactrim and
steroids were added for empiric coverage of PCP when the patient
did not improve. Bactrim was discontinued when bronchscopy
[**Date Range **] culture showed no PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] culture was negative for
bacterial organisms. Prednisone was continued for lung injury
due to ARDS? thought it isn't entirerly clear why steroids were
continued upon [**Location (un) 1131**] the MICU notes.  Vancomycin and zosyn
were started for VAP due to increased [**Location (un) **] production on [**10-12**].
Vancomycin and zosyn were discontinued as patient was improving
on [**10-17**] and there was no clear infiltrate on CXR. On [**10-17**] the
patient had low grade fevers with elevated wbc. She was
re-started on levaquin as she had only received atypical
coverage with levoquin for 7 days during this course. Therefore,
she likely did not receive adequate treatment for atypical CAP.
The thinking was that if this really was an atypical pneumonia
with organisms then patient would require at least 2 weeks of
atypical coverage for which vancomycin and zosyn were not
covering.  Plan to continue until [**2109-10-30**]. Prednisone was weaned
and discontinued on [**10-21**] as patient had improved.

2. Hypotension: With administration of sedatives and paralytics,
patient became hypotensive requiring aggressive fluids and
dopamine. She was difficult to wean off the dopamine likely due
to intravascular depletion. She was found to have a CVP of 2 and
was given albumin for fluid resusictation. FeNa was 0.2% After
extubation the patient developed hypertension. She was diuresed
aggressively and started on antihypertensive medications.

3. Hypertension: Nifedipine was discontinued and the patient was
maintained on toprol xl and lisinopril.

4. Renal Failure: This was in the setting of stopping the
dopamine and was likley due to poor renal perfusion from
intravascular volume depletion. FENa of 0.2% consistent with
pre-renal etiology. Creatinine improved to baseline early in
hospital course. Baseline serum creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL

5. CHF exacerbation - On presentation, patient was fluid
overloaded on physical exam and CXR showing b/l infiltrates that
likely were thought to be due to CHF exacerbation vs. bilateral
pneumonia. Pt has a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with
diastolic dysfunction and clinically presenting with signs and
symptoms of CHF. However, patient did not respond to diuresis
and developed ARDS. Post extubation she was fluid overloaded and
was diuresed with good success. Her dry weight was noted to be
183 in clinic notes, however, on the day of discharge her weight
was 188.6 lbs on standing scale and she appeared nearly
euvolemic.

6. Diabetes: patient was maintained on an insulin drip in the
ICU. She was transitioned back to her outpatient diabetes
medications once out of the ICU. Her blood sugars were mildly
elevated off prednisone and her metformin was increased to 500
[**Hospital1 **] from 750 daily.

7. [**Name (NI) 9520**] Pt with history of a flutter s/p cardioversion now in
sinus. She is being anti-coagulated w
