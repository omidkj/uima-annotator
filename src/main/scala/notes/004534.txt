Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted to the hospital [**2132-1-25**] under the care of
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 363**].  She was informed and consented for
stabilization of her progressive kyphoscolosis, risks and
benefits were explained and she agreed to proceed with the
surgery.  Please see Operative Note for procedure in detail.
Post-operatively she was taken to the PACU and [**Hospital 56339**]
transfered to the floor in stable condtion.  A medicine consult
was obtained for volume overload due to intraoperative fluid.
Lasix X 2 was ordered and she diuresed appropriately. She was
stable on the floor before taking her back to the OR on [**2132-1-28**]
for completion of her anterior stabilization.  Please see
operative note for procedure in detail.  Post-operatively her
hematocrit was noticed to be low and she was transfused 2 units
PRBC.  Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] did well after her second surgery and was taken
back for her third on [**2-1**].  Please see operative note for
procedure in detail.  In the PACU, her oxygen saturation acutely
dropped to the low 80's.  A spiral chest CT was obtained which
showed multiple bilateral PE's.  A heparin drip was ordered as
well as q2 hour neuro checks.  She was transfered to the SICU
for further management.  Hematocrits q6h were obtained.  She was
placed on tube feeds.
An MR of the T- and L- spine as well as a CT of the abdomen were
obtained which showed status post extensive surgery as
previously documented. New
abnormality in the posterior spinal canal space from T1 through
T5 most likely
representing hematoma. Incomplete visualization at L3 which in
this clinical
setting may also represent hematoma compressing the thecal sac.
Possible
paraspinous hematomas or abscess collections especially in the
thoracolumbar
region.  She was taken back to the OR [**2-4**] for evacuation of
hematoma and posterior completion.  Heparin was stopped at
midnight prior to going to surgery.  Please see operative note
for proced
