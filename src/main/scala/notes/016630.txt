Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Cardiac Catheterization
Mitral Valve Annuloplasty
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
**As obtained from patient, patient's son and [**Name (NI) **] records**
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with past history of aortic stenosis, CAD s/p CABG x3
(LIMA to LAD, SVG to RCA, SVG to OM) and s/p LMCA and PCxA
stent, CHF, bronchiectasis, obstructive sleep apnea, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, who presents with progressive dyspnea following
discharge from this hospital on [**2123-8-14**]. She was on room air
upon discharge and saturations were ~92%; however, she reports
that she has been on oxygen "day and night" and presented to the
ED with 3L nasal cannula for supplemental O2. Patient reports
that she has been dyspneic with any movement in the last few
days. Only [**Doctor Last Name **] she is perfectly still will she breath
comfortably. Patient reports that her sputum production had
changed from white sputum early in the week to dark brown sputum
later in the week with some episodes of hemoptysis. Her son
reports several days of low grade fevers. She reports being very
fatigued currently as in such state has a hard time relaying the
history in the past week. She feels that her memory has suffered
during her recent illness. [**Name (NI) **] son states that during an
office visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] yesterday they had discussed
valvuloplatsy and percutaneous aortic valves. When I asked the
son about patient's weight gain since leaving the [**Last Name (STitle) **], she
had only gained 0.4 pounds since discharge on [**2123-8-14**].


In the ED, the patient was afebrile with vitals prior to
transfer of T 97.9, BP 121/63, HR 71, RR 18, O2sat 95% 3L NC.
Had a chest xray in the ED that was consistent with pulmonary
edema; however, underlying pneumonia could not be ruled out.
Patient was subsequently given Levofloxacin 750 mg IV. Patient
also received 20 mg IV lasix while in the ED, but there is no
documentation of a response in urine output to that dose. Was
guaiac negative in the ED.

Pertinent Results:
<b>2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM</b> ([**2123-8-11**]):
[**Location (un) 109**] by plannimetry 0.7cm2. The left atrium is moderately
dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
40-45 %) with inferior akinesis. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
