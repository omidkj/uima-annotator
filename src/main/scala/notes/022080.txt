Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Crestor / Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 88-year-old gentleman with a history of CAD s/p LAD
stent, heart block s/p PPM, Parkinson's who presents with
shortness of breath, cough.

Dr. [**Known lastname **] states that 3 days PTA he noted the onset of sore
throat, rhinorrhea, productive cough with yellow/green
expectorant.  He went to see his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] who diagnosed
him with bronchitis and prescribed a course of Amoxicillin given
his allergy to Fluoroquinolones.  Unfortunately he noted an
increase in cough and SOB.  As such, he presented to the ED.
Patient denies any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, sick
contacts. [**Name (NI) **] received the influenza vaccine but not the H1N1. He
has had decreased PO intake over the past few days secondary to
not feeling well. Dr. [**Known lastname **] denies history of aspiration and eats
a normal diet.

Patient was taken to the ED where his initial vitals were noted
to be T97.7, HR 81, BP 143/62, RR 26, Sat 100% on 5L facemask.
He was triggered in the ED for a RR in the 40s and documented to
have a fever of 102.1 [**Name8 (MD) **] MD note.  Tachypnea seemed to improve
with nebulizer treatment.

Labs were notable for a WBC of 9.6 with a left shift. Creatinine
of 1.4 (prior Creatinine 1.0-1.4). A chest x-ray was obtained
which showed only minimal left basilar atelectasis. Given the
level of his respiratory distress and unremarkable CXR he
underwent a CTA, which showed no evidence of PE but did show
small bilateral pleural effusions small on left and trace on
right.  Possible atelectasis vs infection on left base.  He
received some symptomatic relief with Combivent, he was also
started on Zosyn and Vanc for CAP.

Prior to transfer vital signs were HR 74, 114/67, RR 25, Sat
100% on NRB. In the ICU he was noted to be mildly tachypneic in
the 20s, saturating 99% on 3 LPM nasal cannula.

nasal cannula.

GENERAL: Elderly Caucasian Male with intention tremors sitting
up in bed with mild tachypnea.
HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, mucous membranes tacky.
CARDIAC: Regular rhythm, normal rate. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs,
rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
LUNGS: Crackles noted in the LLL otherwise CTA. noted to be
mildly tachypneic (20s), no accessory muscle use.
ABDOMEN: NABS. Soft, NT, ND. No HSM
Back: No CV tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ pitting edema b/l to knees.
SKIN: No rashes/lesions, ecchymoses.
NEURO: A&Ox3. CN II-[**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 81**], XII intact on examination. Tremors
with tongue protrusion. Intentions tremors noted in upper
extremities.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**11-17**]:
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Left side dual-chamber pacemaker
leads
terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle is again
demonstrated.  The cardiac silhouette is unchanged in size and
within normal limits. The aortic knob is calcified. While there
is mild prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings, no overt
pulmonary edema is noted. There is minimal linear atelectasis
within the left lung base. Otherwise, the lungs are clear
without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No acute skeletal abnormalities are visualized.
IMPRESSION: Minimal left basilar atelectasis. No acute
cardiopulmonary
abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Summary:
This is an 88-year-old gentleman with CAD s/p stent to LAD, h.o.
Wenkebach s/p PPM, Parkinson's disease who presents with cough
suggestive of bronchitis vs. PNA.
.
##. DYSPNEA: Patient with cough, small effusions on CT of chest.
 This was felt to be pneumonia, and he produced sputum at time,
but improved with antibiotics.  Patient has no history of
hospitalization, no aspiration history (denies), and did receive
influenza vaccine this year.  Flu swab and urine legionella are
both negative.  CXR and physical exam did not suggestive of
volume overload.  As such, we felt it appropriate to treat as a
community acquired pneumonia.  Patient received one dose of
zosyn/vanc in ED, but this was switched to ceftriaxone on the
floor.  (Antibiotic choices are limited due to floroquinolone
allegy; moreover, pharmacy warned about the concurrent
administration of azithromycin and amiodarone).  Patient was
given albuterol/ipratropium nebs as needed.  He developed a rash
which went away despite continuation of the antibiotic. He
continued to improved from respiratory standpoint and Oxygen was
weaned.  He will complete 7 day course Ceftriaxone on [**2167-11-25**].
.
##. ELEVATED TROPONINS: Pt noted to have increased Troponin of
0.02, CK 199 with negative CKMBs in the setting of renal
failure. EKG shows no gross ST segment changes but difficult to
interpret [**12-22**] paced rhythm.  Suspect elevated troponins are due
to renal failure.  Second set of cardiac enzymes show CK down to
163 with MB of 4.  An ECHO showed no depressed EF.

##. ELEVATED CREATININE: Pt noted to have borderline pre-renal
azotemia with BUN/Creatinine of 26/1.4. Unfortunately pt has no
recent lab data for an accurate baseline, in the past he has had
Creatinine of 1.3-1.8 (though in the setting of treatment for
prostate cancer).  Mr
