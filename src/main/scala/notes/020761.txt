PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's vitals on admission were a
temperature of 96.8 F, heart rate 70, blood pressure 90/60,
respiratory rate of 15.  Patient was saturating 96% on three
liters, 89% on room air.  Generally he was elderly and
cachectic.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Notable for
anicteric sclerae.  Pupils were equal, round and reactive to
light.  Neck showed no jugular venous pressure.  Chest was
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart was regular rate
with no murmurs.  Abdomen was soft with no tenderness.  Bowel
sounds were present and patient had guaiac positive brown
stool.  Neuro exam was notable for asterixis.  Patient was
somewhat disoriented to follow commands adequately.  Cranial
nerves were grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Notable for a hematocrit of
29, INR of 1.6, white count of 5.9 and platelets 105.
Patient had a BUN of 55 and creatinine of 2.7.  He had a
sodium of 130, potassium 5.9, bicarbonate 14 and chloride of
105.  Patient's liver function tests were notable for ammonia
of 245, ALT 45, AST of 59, alkaline phosphatase 120, amylase
102, lipase 107, total bilirubin of 2.1 and albumin of 2.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short this is a 59-year-old male with
hepatitis C cirrhosis admitted with mental status changes and
guaiac positive stool as well as acute renal failure.
Patient was found to have a creatinine of 25.9 on admission.
Patient had serial blood hematocrit over the next 12 hours
secondary to his guaiac positive stool.  Patient's hematocrit
reached a nadir of 19.7 over the first day of admission.  The
patient was transfused with three units of packed red blood
cells and transferred to the unit.

The patient underwent endoscopy while in the unit and was
noted to have grade I varices in the lower third of the
esophagus that were not bleeding.  Clotted blood was visible
in the fundus and gastric mucosa was thought to be consistent
with stigmata of recent bleeding.  These were thought to be
secondary to portal gastropathy.

The patient was treated with Octreotide for five days
intravenously and patient's hematocrit stabilized after
approximately five units of packed red blood cells.  The
patient did have increased confusion and encephalopathy in
the setting of his GI bleed.  Patient was treated with Flagyl
and Lactulose with return of his mental status back to
baseline which is alert and oriented times three.

The patient began to complain of belly pain during his
admission and had only small ascites on exam, however his
ascitic fluid was tapped and found to have greater than 3000
white blood cells.  This is consistent with spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis, thus patient was started on
Ceftriaxone 2 grams IV q. day.  The patient had improvement
in his abdominal pain.

The patient underwent discussions between himself, his family
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] during which time the patient decided to be
DNR, DNI.  The patient's acute renal failure resolved with
hydration with his creatinine trending back down towards
baseline.  However, patient had markedly increased need for
oxygen during the course of his hospitalization requiring up
to 15 liters face mask to maintain saturations over 90%.
Patient had somewhat diminished oxygen requirements at the
time of discharge and was able to saturate above 90% on five
liters nasal cannula.

Patient, unfortunately, despite stabilization of his GI
bleeding, began to develop increasing bilirubin and
increasing INR for reasons that could not be pin pointed.
The patient's bilirubin reached a high of 30 on the day prior
to discharge.  At this time, the patient and his family
decided to go home with Hospice care.

The patient was discharged on [**2189-1-20**] home to Hospice care
in fair condition.  Patient was discharged home with adequate
Ativan, Morphine and a Scopolamine patch for palliative care.
