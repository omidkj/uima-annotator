Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Called by Emergency Department to evaluate
Thalamic Hemorrhage


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23220**] is a very [**Last Name (un) 1425**] 70 year-old right-handed male
smoker with a past medical history including HTN, HLD, and afib
for which he is on coumadin who presents from [**Hospital3 3583**]
with a left thalamic hemorrhage.

The patient is able to confirm the history as shared by the ED
team and family; he was in his usual state of health until about
4:30 this morning when he was driving independently.  He
apparently experienced the sudden onset of numbness on the right
aspect of his face, right arm, and right leg.  He was first
evaluated at [**Hospital3 3583**], where a non-contrast CT of the
head
was thought to show a left thalamic hemorrhage measuring
approximately 2.9 by 2.2 cm with extension into the left lateral
and third ventricles.  To reverse an INR of 1.9, the patient was
reportedly given 2-4 units of FFP and vitamin k 10 mg IV x 1
before transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.

Mr. [**Known lastname 23220**] indicates that he has since developed difficulty
expressing himself verbally, although he maintians he can
understand what is being said.  He denies prior strokes and
coagulopathies.  He denies current headache.

In the ED he was given profilnine and a non-contrast CT of the
head was repeated to evaluate for hemorrhagic expansion.

unable to name high (watch) and low frequency objects
(knuckles).


Cranial Nerves:

* II: PERRL 3 to 2mm and slightly sluggish.  Visual fields
difficult to formally test but patient seems to attend to all
aspects of visual fields.
* III, IV, VI: EOMI with limited upgaze.
* V: Difficult to formally assess facial sensation in the V1,
V2,
V3 distributions (pt says "I don't know" when asked if the right
and left sides feel roughly the same).
* VII: Flattening of right nasolabial fold.
* VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
* IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
* [**Doctor First Name 81**]: 5/5 strength in trapezii on left. 0/5 on right.
* XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

Motor:
* Bulk: No evidence of atrophy.
* Tone: Flaccid in right extremities.
* Drift: No pronator drift on left.
* Adventitious Movements: slight postural tremor with left arm
outstretched.

Strength:
* Left Upper Extremity:  5 throughout Delt, Biceps, Triceps,
Wrist Ext, Wrist Flex, Finger Ext, Finger Flex
* Right Upper Extremity: 0 throughout Delt, Biceps, Triceps,
Wrist Ext, Wrist Flex, Finger Ext, Finger Flex
* Left Lower Extremity:  5 throughout Iliopsoas, Quad, Ham, Tib
Ant, Gastroc, Ext Hollucis Longis
* Right Lower Extremity: 0 throughout Iliopsoas, Quad, Ham, Tib
Ant, Gastroc, Ext Hollucis Longis

Reflexes:
* Babinski: flexor left, extensor right
- triple flexion with noxious stimulation of right lower
extremity

Sensation:
* Light Touch: intact bilaterally in left lower extremities,
upper extremities, trunk, face; difficult to asses right-sided
sensation

Coordination
* Pt seemed to perform activities (eg reaching for the arm of a
loved one) with acuity

Gait:
* not evaluated

Imaging:

CXR [**2194-12-24**]:
Mild edema at the base of the left lung has worsened. More
severe
consolidation in the right lower lung has also progressed and
could be either
asymmetric edema or edema and new aspiration or developing
pneumonia. Heart
size top normal, is unchanged and mediastinal vascular caliber
is upper limits
of normal. Nasogastric tube passes as far as the distal
esophagus but the tip
is indistinct. No pneumothorax.

CXR [**2195-11-22**]:
Exam is technically limited by respiratory motion artifact.
Cardiac
silhouette appears enlarged but pulmonary vascularity is within
normal limits
for technique. The lungs are grossly clear except for an
apparent right
retrocardiac opacity which could be due to either atelectasis or
infectious
pneumonia. Standard PA and lateral chest radiograph would be
helpful to more
fully evaluate this region when the patient's condition allows.

Ct head [**2194-12-20**]:
The left thalamic hemorrhage is again noted and allowing for
expected evolution, not significantly changed from prior. The
hyperdense
focus measures 2.7 x 2.3 cm compared to 3.2 x 2.0 cm,
previously. There is a similar amount of surrounding vasogenic
edema. There is persistent mass
effect on the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle but
no evidence of ventriculomegaly. There is unchanged hyperdense
material in the left lateral ventricle. Small amount of
hyperdense material in the right ventricle is also unchanged.
There is no shift of the normally midline structures. The
basilar cisterns are preserved. There is no new hemorrhage or
acute major vascular territory infarction. The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. No
osseous abnormality is identified.

IMPRESSION: No significant change in the left thalamic
parenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension. No new
intracranial hemorrhage or other acute abnormality.
