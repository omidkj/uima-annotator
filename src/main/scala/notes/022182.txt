Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation with sedation

History of Present Illness:
89 year old Russian speaking male with CAD s/p CABG in [**2169**],
medically managed NSTEMI [**9-/2182**], Afib (not on coumadin),
tachy/brady syndrome s/p dual chamber PPM [**2175**], DM, CHF (EF
45-50%), and PVD who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with progressive
SOB over the last 3 days. He was recenrlt discharged from rehab,
and had not been taking any coreg or diuretic. His appetite in
rehab was poor, and once he returned home he started eating more
food with high salt content. He had gained some weight recently
(unclear how much), buit the family thinks this was in the
setting of his increased appetite. He did not have any
significant edema, and it was unclear if he had any orthopnea or
PND.
On arrival to the ED his VS were T:98.6, HR:74, BP:195/86,
O2:88% on RA -> 98% on 100% NRB. CXR revealed bilateral fluffy
infiltrates c/w pulmonary edema or a diffuse infectious
process/ARDS. Due to increased respiratory distress the patient
was intubated. He was given CTX/azithromycin for possible CAP,
and about 1.3L of IVF total. Initial labs were notable for
mildly increased BUN/Cr (Cr 1.1 up minimally from baseline if
0.9-1.0), a normal CKMB of 3, a Tn of 0.01, WBC of 10.1, stable
HCT/plts, and a lactate of 1.3. ECG revealed V-pacing without
significant ischemic changes. The patient was transfered to the
MICU for further monitoring. He was given broad spectrum abx for
possible HCAP, and given lasix and nitroglycerine for possible
CHF. Cardiology was consulted for assistance in managing the
patient's possible heart failure.
The patient is unable to provide information on his review of
systems

IMAGING
[**2183-8-25**] CHEST X-RAY
IMPRESSION:  Severe pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural
effusions.

[**2183-8-26**] CHEST X-RAY
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an
increase in
extent of the pre-existing bilateral pleural effusions.  The
signs of moderate
pulmonary edema are unchanged.  Increasing extent of the
pre-existing basilar
areas of atelectasis.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
 Unchanged
monitoring and support devices.

[**2183-8-27**] CHEST X-RAY
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**8-26**], 2:52 a.m.

Following extubation, lung volumes are slightly lower,
exaggerating volume of
the already moderate-to-large left pleural effusion.  Slightly
smaller right
pleural effusion has decreased.  Previous mild pulmonary edema
in the upper
lungs has improved, but atelectasis at the left lung base has
worsened.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
Transvenous
right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are continuous
from the left
axillary pacer.

[**2183-8-28**] CHEST X-RAY
IMPRESSION:  Extensive pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural
effusions, left
greater than right.  Partial left lower lobe collapse secondary
to effusion.

[**2183-8-29**] CHEST X-RAY
In comparison with the study of [**8-28**], there is continued
substantial pulmonary edema with bilateral effusions and
compressive
atelectasis in a patient with previous CABG and dual-channel
pacemaker device
in place.

[**2183-8-28**] UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND
No evidence of DVT within the left upper extremity.

[**2183-8-26**] TRANSTHORACIC ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis and apical
hypokinesis/akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent
fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-10-18**],
apical hypokinesis/akinesis appears to be new. Comparison with
prior study is limited by suboptimal views.


Brief Hospital Course:
88M history of AF with tachy/brady syndrome s/p PPM in [**2175**] not
on AC, DMII, CAD s/p CABG and recent NSTEMI, sCHF with EF45-50%
and orthostatic hypotension who presents with increased work of
breathing per the wife.

# Respiratory Failure: DDx originally included infectious versus
cardiovascular. Sepsis is felt to be unlikely given normal
lactate, no bandemia, and negative U/A. Infectious source could
possibly be lungs, with history of SOB, although collateral
history is somewhat vague, per ED the patient did not have any
fevers at home.

Was felt to most likely be secondary to a cardiogenic source,
given patent was hypertensive on arrival, with SBP in the 200s,
as well as a history of HF with an EF <45% with CXR consistnent
with pulmonary edema. In addition, BNP is elevated from prior
admission. ECHO showed a new decrease in EF to 30% with FWM
abnormalities. The patient was treated with a nitro gtt as well
as daily diuresis
