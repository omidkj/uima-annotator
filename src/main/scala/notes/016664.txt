History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86426**] is a 79 year old male with extensive medical
history, including known aortic stenosis, who presented to OSH

[**2101-1-21**] Chest CT Scan:
1. Heavy calcification of the aortic valve, with calcifications
seen along the left lateral wall of the ascending aorta.
Remainder of the aorta beyond  the aortic arch is more heavily
calcified. Coronary artery calcifications.
2. Multiple tiny peripheral and subpleural lung nodules, some
calcified, all measuring less than 4 mm. These may represent
noncalcified as well as
calcified granulomas, however, if the patient is at high risk
for
intrathoracic malignancy, followup CT chest would be recommended
in 12 months' time, otherwise no further followup would be
recommended by the [**Last Name (un) 8773**] society guidelines.
3. Small areas of consolidation, in the right upper and left
lower lobes, most probably infectious or inflammatory in
etiology, however, followup CT may  be considered to document
resolution and to exclude underlying malignancy, particularly in
the right upper lobe.
4. Prominent lymph nodes, particularly in the retroperitoneum.
Clinical significance of these is indeterminate, and followup CT
would be recommended  to evaluate stability of mediastinal and
retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
5. Cholelithiasis.
[**2101-1-25**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
[**2101-1-25**] Carotid Ultrasound:
There is less than 40% stenosis within the internal carotid
arteries bilaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86426**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service. Given
atrial fibrillation, he was maintained on intravenous Heparin.
He otherwise remained stable on medical therapy and underwent
extensive preoperative evaluation by the vascular, renal and
dental services. Given his declining renal function, a temporary
tunnelled catheter was placed for dialysis on [**1-24**].
Vascular surgery saw the patient for dry gangrene of the left
toes.  He was eventually cleared by the Vascular service and
required teeth extraction prior to cardiac surgical
intervention. Preoperative course was also notable for a
positive urine analysis which was treated with a three day
course of Ciprofloxacin.  On [**2101-1-28**] he was taken to the
operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x1
(saphenous vein grafted to the right coronary artery)/Aortic
Valve Replacement (#21mm CE Magna tissue valve). Please refer to
Dr.[**Name (NI) 10342**] operative report for further details. Cardiopulmonary
bypass time=115 minutes.  Cross clamp time=83minutes. Mr.[**Known lastname 86426**]
was intubated and sedated, transferred to the CVICU in stable
but critical condition, requiring Epinephrine to optimize
cardiac function. In the first twenty four hours he was weaned
from sedation, awoke, and was extubated.  He underwent
hemodialysis on post operative day one and pressors were weaned
as tolerated.  Hematology was consulted due to arterial clots
noted intraoperative, see TEE report, and was worked up for DIC
but was felt to be vitamin K deficient.  Coumadin had been
started on post operative day one and held when INR > 2.5,
restarted [**2-3**] with 1 mg, as required anticoagulation for atrial
fibri
