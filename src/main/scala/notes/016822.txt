Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 69-year-old gentleman with
known history of coronary artery disease who is status post a
left anterior descending coronary artery stent and status
post an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, presented to
[**Hospital3 4527**] with left chest pain and pressure radiating
down his left arm.  He took some Tums and some aspirin at
home and came into [**Hospital3 4527**].  He was severely
hypertensive with a blood pressure of 220/120 with EKG
showing sinus tachycardia and ST depressions.  His
cross-clamp showed a questionable widened mediastinum.  He
was started on a nitroglycerin drip.  His chest pain resolved
and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**].  He was also given Lasix at [**Hospital3 4527**].  He was
also in the middle of a five-day course of amoxicillin and
prednisone for question of bronchitis.  He had had shortness
of breath and productive cough with green sputum x one week.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Coronary artery disease with left
anterior descending coronary artery stent.  2. Status post
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.  3. Status post myocardial
infarction.  4. Hypertension.  5. Bladder carcinoma with
prior chemotherapy course.  6. Question chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  7. Status post appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Metoprolol.  2. Aspirin.  3.
Univasc.  4. Amoxicillin.  5. Prednisone.  6. Welchol
tablets.  7. Guaifenesin.  8. Nortriptyline.

He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 131, K 4.3, chloride 93, CO2 23, BUN
13, creatinine 1.0, glucose 310, platelet count 279,000.
White count 10.6, hematocrit 46.9.  His INR was 1.4 on
admission with a PTT of 48.9 on heparin.  Chest x-ray did
show a poor study with the patient rotated and probable
congestive heart failure with a question of a widened
mediastinum.  His chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 190**] did not show congestive heart failure or
mediastinal widening.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]
service of cardiology who planned to have him catheterized.
He did have enzyme elevations in the setting of his
hypertension and known coronary artery disease.  There was
also a question of whether or not the patient had hepatitis.
His liver function tests were elevated with an alkaline
phosphatase of 166, ALT 101, AST 77, total bilirubin 0.58.
His INR had been elevated as previously mentioned.  It was
confirmed that he did have unstable angina and on the 14th he
was catheterized.  This showed 80% left main disease.  He was
seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 71**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 72**], cardiothoracic surgery fellow, who
noted his history.  His blood pressure at the time of
examination was 126/59 with a heart rate sinus in the 90s.
His neck had no bruits.  His heart was regular rate and
rhythm, no murmur.  His lungs had some rhonchi and wheezes
and he continued to cough during the examination.  His
abdomen was soft and nontender with some hepatomegaly.  His
extremities had good peripheral pulses and no varicosities.
The plan was to schedule him for bypass surgery once his
lungs cleared.

He was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] who noted that the need for
working up his liver function tests and INR was required
before surgery, and in addition to clearing his cough.  The
patient also noted to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] that he complained of a
persistent bleeding problem periodically, and he asked for
hematology consultation.  The patient was seen by hematology
who also noted that he had had hematuria post cystoscopy for
his bladder cancer and had been on aspirin.  Their
recommendations were discussed with cardiology.  The patient
continued to have an upper respiratory infection and over the
course of the next several days the patient also received a
GI consultation for working up his elevated liver enzymes.
The ultrasound of his right upper quadrant showed that the
left lobe of the liver had bulbous contour in sections 2 and
3, no definite mass, a simple cyst with normal flow.
Pancreas and spleen were unremarkable.  Please refer to the
GI report.  Their impression was that there was no clear
etiology and a question of whether this was alcohol induced.
There was no ascites on examination or splenomegaly but they
could not rule out significant fibrosis.  They recommended
getting a liver biopsy but that would require stopping his
anticoagulation so they recommended multiple laboratory tests
for a noninvasive approach first and possible MRI of the
liver to evaluate the hepatic vasculature.

Two days later his liver enzymes dropped to ALT of 62 and AST
of 70, total bilirubin 1.2 with an alkaline phosphatase of
116.  He was off nitroglycerin at that time secondary to a
headache and remained chest pain free.  He continued on his
Lopressor and aspirin and Welchol.  The mixing study from
hematology showed a factor deficiency.  The patient was given
vitamin K repletion with recommendations to give some fresh
frozen plasma preoperatively.  The GI service said possible
MRV.  His chronic obstructive pulmonary disease appeared to
be related to his bronchitis.  His lungs slowly started to
clear.  He continued on amoxicillin.

He was also seen by case management very early in his
hospitalization, on the 18th.

He had hepatomegaly with mildly elevated liver function
tests.  There was a question of cirrhosis versus metastatic
disease.  The plan was to try to get an MRI and MRV on the
19th.  He continued to receive vitamin K p.o.  He had a
little bit of hyponatremia with a sodium of 134.  He
continued to ambulate well on his own.  He had no complaints.
He was not having any chest pain at the time.

The MRI of his abdomen showed that the liver had a nodular
contour and enhanced heterogeneously.  He had a peripheral
area of increased arterial enhancement posteriorly in segment
6, which was nonspecific.  He had a few tiny cysts.  These
findings were consistent with cirrhosis and they have
recommended further follow up prior to his surgery.

The day prior to his operation he had a little bit of basilar
crackles but no wheezes.  He had no extremity edema.  His
white count was 8.8.  He had no chest pain.  He remained on a
heparin drip.  He also had some right lung base atelectasis.
Chest x-ray showed no pneumonia but a possible small pleural
effusion.  On the day prior to surgery he had completed seven
days of a seven-day course of amoxicillin.  His hyponatremia
resolved the following day.

On the 21st the patient underwent an off-pump coronary artery
bypass grafting x 4 by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary
artery, a vein graft to the diagonal, vein graft to obtuse
marginal and vein graft to the posterior descending coronary
artery.  It was determined by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] that this was probably
a Child A class cirrhosis with a question of a factor
deficiency.  His ejection fraction was approximately 60% at
the time of operation.

On postoperative day one he was on an insulin drip at 1, a
Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.7 and propofol.  He received one
unit of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen
plasma overnight and his Plavix was started on postoperative
day one.  He remained intubated and sedated.  Postoperatively
he had a K of 4.5, BUN of 16, creatinine 0.6, a white count
of 10.4, hematocrit of 26.6 and a platelet count of 119,000.
He remained intubated and sedated.  He did wake up though.
He was on Neo-Synephrine.  His urine output was good.  He had
no other issues and all of his monitoring remained in place
as he stayed in the intensive care unit.

On postoperative day two he was awake and alert.  His heart
was regular rate and rhythm.  He started his Lopressor.
Plavix and aspirin continued.  His lungs were clear.  His
wounds w
