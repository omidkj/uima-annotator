History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 57 year old female who has previously received care at
[**Hospital3 **] and [**Hospital1 2025**], pmhx significant for obesity, a-fib, htn, CHF
w/ likely diastolic dysfunction, who presented to ED by EMS and
found to be in VF, pulseless and apneic.  Per patient's husband,
they had been running errands in the car, when he noticed her
shaking and "eyes rolled back", unresponsive.  He pulled over

110-120, BP 220/palp.  Dopamine discontinued, lidocaine drip
continued.  Noted to be hypokalemic to 2.8, lactate 9.7.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Neuro- The patient was admitted to the CCU following
resuscitation from a v-fib cardiac arrest, after being
unresponsive for an undetermined amount of time.  At the time of
admission, the patient was intubated with profound neurological
deficits including an absent corneal reflex, absent pupillary
reflex, absent gag reflex, no spontaneous movement in her
extremities, and did not show any response to painful stimuli.
Neurology was consulted on the evening of admission, and the
patient underwent a head CT which was negative for acute
hemorrhage.  An EEG was performed the following day which showed
bursts of theta/delta activity and suppressive bursts are all
compatible with a post-anoxic encephalopathy of moderate degree.
There was no sustained seizure activity or clear epileptiform
activity.  The patient underwent a repeat EEG a few days
following admission, which showed no EEG rhythms seen, this
tracing shows worsening compared to the prior EEG and is
suggestive of a poor prognosis. No focal,lateralizing, or
epileptiform features were seen.
2. Cardiac- In terms of her cardiac disease, the patient
underwent an echocardiogram which showed the left atrium to be
moderately dilated, the right atrium is moderately  dilated, the
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Anterior, septal and
apical  hypokinesis to akinesis is present. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. An exact
EF cannot be determined.  The patient was initially placed on
afterload reduction, but was later discontinued on all blood
pressure medications as she became hypotensive.  The patient was
initially made DNR/DNI by her husband, but this was reversed and
the patient was resuscitated again after an asystole cardiac
arrest on the second day of admission.  The patient was
monitored on telemetry and found to be persistently in atrial
fibrillation, was subsequently loaded and started on IV
amiodarone, resulting in effective rate control.  Her
electrolytes were carefully monitored and replaced to avoid
precipitating further arrhythmias.  The patient's blood pressure
remained stable without further intervention.
3. Pulmonary- The patient remained intubated throughout her
hospitalization for respiratory failure thought to be secondary
to cardiac arrest which resulted in ARDS versus aspiration
pneumonia.  The patient was found to have a left-sided
pneumothorax that resolved with chest tube placement.  The
patient was treated with a ten day course of antibiotics and
blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures were all
negative for any significant growth.  After being intubated for
over one week, the patient was evaluated by surgery for trach
placement, which was thought to be likely difficult and
associated with high risk.
4. Renal- the patient's creatinine at the time of admission was
2.1 and rose to 4.0, at which point the patient also became
oliguric, likely secondary to ATN.  The patient's urine output
eventually improved and creatinine trended down to baseline.
5. Endocrine- the patient had a history of hypothyroidism with a
prominent goiter and insulin dependent diabetes.  The patient
was placed on an insulin drip for tight blood glucose control.
Thyroid studies were sent and returned normal.
6. The patient was started on tube feeds for nutrition, and was
maintained on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  In
addition, she was monitored for pain with pain medications
administered as needed.
As her neurological exam remained unchanged throughout her
hospitalization, a number of conversations were had with her
husband and family about goals of care and prognosis.  A
palliative care consult was placed and a family meeting was
arranged which included social work and ethics in addition to
the primary team and palliative care.  It was explained to the
family that further resuscitation would be medically futile and
that the patient would not regain any meaningful quality of
life.  The husband, who was the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy,
decided to extubate the patient and make her comfort measures
only.  The patient was extubated and placed on standing pain
medications and anxiolytics for comfort.  The patient expired
within ten minutes of extubation with her family present at her
bedside.
