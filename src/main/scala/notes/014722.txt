Admission Date:  [**2118-2-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2118-2-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**2056-9-19**]       Sex:  F

Service: Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
woman with a past medical history of a left MCA stroke
secondary to paradoxical embolus from a hypercoagulable state
and a PFO.  She presents with a two day history of nausea,
vomiting, vertigo and a one day history of double vision.  On
Wednesday, prior to admission, she developed flu-like
symptoms which consisted of diarrhea or nausea.  On the day
of admission, she became unsteady and dizzy and complained of
double vision.  She also noticed an occipital headache that
was mild.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  PFO positive for deep venous thrombosis and
anticardiolipin antibody
2.  Left MCA stroke in [**2114**] with aphasia, right hemiparesis
and speech difficulty

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Her blood pressure was 170/90, heart rate 101,
respiratory rate 13, saturations 99%.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur or
bruits.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  She was awake, alert and oriented x3 with mild
dysarthria.  Language normal.  Right pupil was 4 mm; left was
2 mm, sluggish reacting.  Her visual fields were full.  Her
EOMs were full bilaterally.  She had a right facial droop and
a decreased right corneal on the right side.  Her tongue and
palate were symmetric.  Shoulders rose symmetrically.  She
had no drift.

IMAGING:  MRI of the brain showed a 3 x 4 x 3 cm right
cerebellar hemorrhage.

The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
for close observation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2118-2-12**], the patient's mental status
deteriorated.  She became lethargic and unresponsive.  She
was taken emergently to the Operating Room for evacuation of
cerebellar hematoma.  She had a right suboccipital craniotomy
for excision of this hematoma and there were no
intraoperative complications.  Postoperative, the patient was
again monitored in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  She was
intubated.  She was sleepy, but arousable, opened her eyes to
command, followed some commands, moved all four extremities.

She had a vent drain placed intraoperatively.  She was seen
by the hematology oncology service secondary to
anticardiolipin antibody.  They recommended IVC filter and
possible corrective surgery for the PFO.  Cardiology was also
consulted regarding the PFO who also recommended surgical
repair of the PFO, but due to the fact that the patient
needed to be anticoagulated, this was decided to be delayed
secondary to her bleeding in her brain and done at a later
time.  The patient developed right lower lobe pneumonia and
she was started on Levaquin for gram negative rods in her
sputum.  She was extubated on [**2117-2-14**] breathing
spontaneously.  Sputum grew out haemophilus and she was
continued on Levaquin for a 10 day course.  A repeat head CT
on [**2118-2-18**] showed no change, good evacuation of the
hematoma.  Drain was clamped on [**2118-2-20**].  Drain was
discontinued on [**2118-2-21**] and the patient was transferred to
the regular floor.  She was seen by physical therapy and
occupational therapy and found to require rehabilitation
prior to discharge home.

Neurologically, she was awake, alert and oriented x3 with no
drift moving all extremities strongly.  Her incision was
clean, dry and intact.  Her staples were removed on [**2118-2-23**]
and her incision was clean and dry.  She had suffered some
trauma to her urethra secondary to Foley catheter placement.
Urology service was consulted and they recommended leaving
the Foley catheter in for one week to allow decrease in
ecchymosis and edema of the urethra.  The patient was seen by
the cardiology service and the hematology service and will
require repair of the PFO at a later time and then most
likely IVC filter placement after repair of the PFO.  The
patient will be discharged to rehabilitation and then brought
back for repair of the PFO at a later date.
