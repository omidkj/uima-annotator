Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 710**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, Fever and Cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
76-year-old W with DM2, CRI (last GFR 23), Obesity, HTN, and IBS
who presents to ED after ~ 7d of cough, fever, nasal congestion,
worsening SOB in setting of 1.5yrs of DOE, fatigue, and black
stools.
.
Pt. reports 1.5 yrs of worsening fatigue/lack of energy since a
RT at that time.  Since the infection, she reports she has never
recovered.  She has noted progressively worsening DOE and nasal
congestion, productive of green purulent sputum with fevers
Q2-3months and blood tinged sputum.  These would resolve on
their own, however, would recur regularly.
.
[**Known firstname **] was in USOH (as above) until ~ 7d ago, when she noted
worsening nasal congestion, subjective fever, anorexia and NP[**MD Number(3) 23674**].  Her DOE worsened to the point where she was unable to
ambulate from living room to kitchen and noted severe HAs along
with sinus tenderness.  In addition, describes central CP with
exertion, w/o diaphoresis/n/v or radiation. Her fatigue cough
have gotten worse to the pt. that she did not take anything PO x
3-4 days.  Objective temp maxed out at 103F, w/ chills.  She has
been taking up to 650mg QID for fevere and pain.  Her sister
made her go to the [**Name (NI) **].
.
Over the past year she has noted black stools w/o wt. loss,
abdominal discomfort with food intake, progressively worsening
exercise tolerance, recurrent skin rashes and recently oral
ulcers.  She reported recurrent orthopne and PND.
.
Per Admission note, "upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], vitals were: T 97,
BP 183/52, HR 103, RR 18, SaO2 74% RA. The patient was triggered
for hypoxemia. Her SaO2 responded to 6L FM and her breathing
became more comfortable. She had a chest x-ray which the EW
reported as early pneumonia. She was given IVFs, ceftriaxone 1g
IV and azithromycin 500mg PO. Her oxygen status continued to
improve and she is comfortable on 4L NC. She was admitted to
medicine for further evaluation and management."
.
At time of interview, she reported feeling much improved, but
cont. to have SOB.  She did not have other active complaints w/
exeption of fatigue.
.

Imaging/Studies:
.
ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.
Abnormal LVOT systolic flow contour without frank obstruction.
Diastolic dysfunction. No significant valvular abnormality.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
CXR on admission:
IMPRESSION: Subtle nodular opacities in the left mid lung, for
which CT is
recommended to more clearly assess. Vague increased opacities in
the lower
lungs bilaterally which could reflect crowding of
bronchovasculature though early pneumonia cannot be entirely
excluded. Recommend repeat with more optimized technique with a
dedicated PA and lateral view.
.
VQ scan: [**10-13**]
.
IMPRESSION: 1. Triple matched (ventilation, perfusion, and chest
radiograph) abnormality in the left upper lung of unclear
significance. Correlation with chest CT is recommended. 2.
Central clumping and decreased peripheral distribution of tracer
on ventilation images, consistent with airways disease. 3. Low
likelihood ratio for pulmonary embolism.
.
CT chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal peribronchovascular consolidative foci.
Differential includes bacterial infection, though atypical
organisms could also cause this appearance. Nocardia is a
possibility. Septic emboli are not excluded, but the
ill-marginated appearance and air-bronchograms make this less
likely. Multifocal bronchoalveolar neoplasm is not excluded, so
radiographic follow-up to assess for resolution following
treatment is recommended
2. Basal atelectas
