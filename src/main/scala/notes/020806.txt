Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with a past medical history significant for
coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension on Plavix
presenting after being found down. She was last seen in her
normal state of health last evening, but was found this morning
lying near the bathtub. Patient was unable to characterize the
fall or explain exactly how it happened. Per the EMS when
presenting to the ED, she had significant trauma with his left
arm trapped under her body, with bruising and dried blood on her
face, left arm, and left leg. On ROS, her family reports 2 days
of increased urinary frequency and foul smelling urine.
.
After a discussion with her sister, [**Name (NI) **], it appears that
her symptoms are all acute.  Her sister talks with her twice a
day and reports that she did not have any slurred speech until
the day of admission.  Sister found her at 1pm on the bathroom
floor.  Also, she was quite functional at home, going up and
down the stairs daily.  She had been having global wekaness for
about 2-3 weeks but absolutely did not have left > right
weakness or difficulty moving.  She does not even use a walker
or cane prior, last fall was 3-4 years ago.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 96.7, 107, 163/79, 18 and 93% on RA.
 Exam was notable for an initial GCS of 7 that quickly improved
to 14 as the ED team was preparing to intubate (later found out
that she was DNR/DNI). Her left arm had diffuse erythema but was
soft and had strong distal pulses, without concern for
compartment syndrome.  She was noted to have decreased strength
in the left arm, with positive babinski on the left.  Labs were
notable for a troponin elevation to 0.17 (unknown baseline) with
mildly elevated CKs to 1101, trending up from 1015 and a WBC of
11.9 with no bandemia and mild left shift.  EKG showed
irregularly irregular rhythm at ~92bpm with LAD, Q waves in II,
III, as well as diffuse TWIs in II, III, aVF, V4-V6 and poor
R-wave progression.  She was treated with ceftriaxone for a
presumed UTI with U/A showing 17 WBCs and few bacteria with
small leuk esterase.  Imaging was remarkable for a CT head
showing an acute/subacute right MCA territory stroke and CT neck
with an old dens fx that is s/p surgical repair.  CT torso with
bilateral pleural effusions, R>L.
.
Trauma cleared patient and Neuro noted dysarthria and mixed
aphasia (fluent non-sense speech, follows some simple commands,
but only intermittently), and extensive upper motor neuron signs
on the left.  They planned to follow-up with further recs and
recommended goal SBPs 120-160.  She received 2L NS in total and
was sent to the ICU.
.
Vitals on transfer: 97.7, 97, 157/71, 16 and 96% on 2L
.
On arrival to the MICU, she was lying in bed and still with
dysarthria but following simple commands.  She did not move her
left side.
