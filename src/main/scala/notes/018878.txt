noted to be in worse condition compared to his previous
office visit in [**2122-7-26**].  The patient has also had

respiratory rate of 20.  On head and neck examination, the
patient's mucous membranes were moist, and his oropharynx was
clear.  His pupils were equal and reactive to light.  On
cardiovascular examination, the patient's jugular venous
pressure was noted to be at 14 cm above the sternal angle.
He had a normal S1 and S2, and he had an audible S3 and S4.
He also had a 2/6 systolic murmur at his left sternal border
radiating to his right second intercostal space and to his
apex.  On respiratory examination, the patient had a few
scattered inspiratory crackles at the bases.  His abdominal

abdominal distention or pain on palpation.  His liver was
palpable 4 cm below the costal margin.  On musculoskeletal
examination, the patient was noted to have a slight amount of
edema in his ankles at 1+.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  The patient's electrocardiogram showed
him to be AV-paced at a rate of 70.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  The patient's Chem-7 revealed
a sodium of 129, potassium of 5.2, chloride 92,
bicarbonate 26, BUN 65, and creatinine of 2.5; in comparison
to [**9-15**], where his BUN was 58 and creatinine was 2.5.
His complete blood count showed a white blood cell count

PT was 14.5, PTT of 29.2, and INR of 1.4.  His urinalysis was
negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit and was initiated on a milrinone infusion with a
50-mcg/kg bolus, followed by a 0.28-mg/kg/min. infusion.  He
was also given an intravenous dose of Lasix 40 mg.  The
patient remained on his baseline medications and continued
with the milrinone until the day before discharge.  He was
completely stable during his hospital course.

He was transferred to the floor on [**2122-10-5**].  His
milrinone infusion was continued for a total duration of four
days.  During that time, the patient's net total body fluid
balance was minus approximately 4 liters.  The patient was
restarted on his p.o. Lasix dose on [**10-5**] and was
diuresing well following the discontinuation of his milrinone
infusion.  Symptomatically, the patient was improved and felt
less short of breath.  He was able to go for short walks
without any difficulty.

The patient was discharged to home on [**10-6**].  He was
given a dose of Epogen 10,000 units subcutaneous times one to
save him an additional trip to get Epogen tomorrow.  He also
