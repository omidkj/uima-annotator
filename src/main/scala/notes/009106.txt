CTA [**7-19**]
CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is
no central,
segmental, large subsegmental pulmonary embolism. Thoracic
aortic and arch
calcifications are noted without aneurysms, dissection or
stenosis. Coronary
artery calcifications as well as mitral annulus calcifications
are evident.
There is no pericardial effusion. The heart size is normal.
Multiple
calcified lymph nodes are evident.

Lung windows demonstrate mild bibasilar atelectasis. There is
linear scarring at the right lower lobe. There is no pleural
effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidations. Right lower
lobe nodular focus is unchanged measuring 5 mm (3:51). Linear
scarring is also noted at the left lower lobe, unchanged.
Evaluation of parenchymal detail is obscured due to respiratory
motion.

There is a benign appearing posterior midline soft tissue low
attenuation
focus, could represent a sebaceous cyst.

Limited evaluation of imaged upper abdomen demonstrates small
amount of
perihepatic free fluid. Gallbladder calcification is partially
visualized and could represent gallbladder stones. The
visualized portions of the spleen, intraabdominal bowel loops is
unremarkable. There is a sclerotic focus in the posterior lower
thoracic vertebral body, which could likely represent a bone
island. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are
noted. Striated appearance of lower thoracic vertebral bodies
could represent hemangiomas.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.

2. Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes suggesting old
granulomatous disease.


The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
.
CXR [**7-19**]
FINDINGS: Portable AP chest radiograph is reviewed and compared
to [**2113-5-5**].
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Lungs are clear.
Pulmonary
vascularity is normal. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 F with history of HTN, pulmonary HTN, admitted with chest
pain then later developing diarrhea/abdominal pain and diagnosed
with C.diff, transfer to MICU [**7-23**] with hypotension.

She presented to ED on [**2113-7-19**] with chest pain x 2 weeks with
recent worsening, and fatigue.  Had CTA in ED to rule out PE,
aortic dissection.  Cardiac enzymes negative x 3 sets.  WBCs
17.9 on admission.  Also thought to have ?cellulitis and so
clindamycin started (received 3 doses); also s/p 10 day course
of clinda one month ago for cellulitis.  The following day
([**7-20**]) she also complained of abdominal pain, also developed
watery diarrhea.  Empiric C.diff coverage (flagyl PO) started on
[**7-20**] afternoon, stool studies returned positive.  On [**7-22**] PM, in
light of worsening white count, renal function her regimen was
changed to PO vanc and IV flagyl.  Was also treated with IV
vanco for [**12-28**] positive blood cultures which later returned coag
neg staph, so IV vanco not continued.
.
BPs in 140s at baseline per clinic notes.  On heavy antiHTN
regimen including lisinopril 80, clonidine 0.3, nifedepine 60.
Upon admission, these meds continued through [**7-21**] AM (generally
running in 100-110s range following admission).  No anti-HTN
meds [**7-22**] due to low BPs.  SBP in low 90s [**7-21**] overnight, then
[**7-22**] SBP 72 by doppler.
.
# Hypotension.  Likely combination of sepsis from C.diff,
hypovolemia from inadequate PO plus diarrhea.  Pt hypotension
