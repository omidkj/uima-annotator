History of Present Illness:
61 M w/ h/o aortobifem in [**2132**], presents to the ED w/ new chest
and LLE pain. The patient states that he has had ~12 hrs of
chest pain w/ no radiation as well as worsening LLE pain. He has
noticed that his left foot is cooler than his right, although is
unsure how for how long this has been present. He states that he
has not had previous difficulty with his LLE. He has been seen
in the ED previously with similar chest pain, and report of LLE
pain at that time. The patient states he can only walk [**8-12**]
steps before he has to stop because of pain. He has had one
episode of emesis, no fevers or chills. He was
taking plavix and aspirin for a drug eluding stent, but stopped
because of difficulty obtaining the medication.

CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis with b/l LE runoff [**2140-5-31**]

1.  Severe atherosclerotic disease of the distal aorta and iliac
system, with complete occlusion of the left limb of an
aortobifem graft.  The left superficial and deep femoral
arteries are reconstituted by collateral flow near the level of
the distal graft touchdown.  There is a three-vessel runoff in
the left calf, however, the anterior tibial and peroneal
branches become attenuated at the mid calf due to delayed bolus
arrival.

2.  Patent right aortofemoral graft, which is moderately
narrowed.  There is two-vessel runoff in the right calf, noting
the anterior tibial artery becomes occluded just dital to its
origin.

3.  Thyroid isthmus nodule; recommend correlation with prior
thyroid imaging, and if indicated further evaluation with
thyroid ultrasound if not done
elsewhere.

4.  Moderate pulmonary emphysema.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the vascular surgical service after
undergoing a CTA of his torso with run off that showed an
occlusion of his prior aorto-bifemoral bypass graft.  His
original complaint of chest pain resolved prior to his admision
and his cardiac enzymes remained within normal limits without
EKG changes.  A heparin drip was initiated and PTT optimized at
a goal of 60-80.  A cardiology consult was obtained (see
inclosed) for his history of chest pain and to evaluate for
preoperative cardiac clearance.  Medical opitimization was
recommended without further cardiac studies.

An axillo-bifemoral graft (a repeat aorto-bifem was deferred in
favor of the axillobifem due to his cardiac disease) was
undertaken [**2140-6-2**].  The operative note can be requested if
needed but is currently in dictation.  He tolerated the
procedure well.  The origin of the graft was the right proximal
axillary artery and propaten graft was used.  The distal limbs
were anastamosed to the right SFA and the left profunda
arteries.  The flow intraoperatively was excellent.
Postoperatively he was resumed on a heparin gtt but initially
started at 500units/hr then increased to 700units the following
morning.  A graft pulse was palpable however it was noted to be
weaker on POD1 and an ultrasound was planned which the patient
refused.  A venous signal only was dopplerable in the patient's
left foot postoperatively as he had preop.  He continued to have
pain in his left lower extremity and a consideration of a future
left femoral to above knee popliteal graft will need to be made.

He was monitored overnight on POD 1 with an arterial line
without issue and removed on POD1.  A central line that was
placed [**2140-6-2**] in the operating room was left in place for
access.  His foley catheter was placed [**2140-6-2**] and was removed
POD1 due to patient request.
