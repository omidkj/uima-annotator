History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34808**] is a 74 yoM w/ a h/o htn, hypercholesterolemia,
PVD, ESRD on HD, AS s/p AVR who is transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for chest pain and SOB. Patient reports being in his
usual state of health until 2 weeks ago after having skin
resections for skin cancer. The following day, patient went to
HD and following HD felt extremely fatigued and generally
unwell. Over the next 2 weeks, he has had DOE w/ 1 flight of
stairs and half a mile. Prior to 2 weeks ago, he was able to do
stairs and walk a couple of miles w/o SOB. He has been spending
a significant amount of time in bed due to fatigue and SOB over
the last two weeks and also endorses 2 pillow orthopnea which is
also new.
.
Approximately 3 days ago, he developed episodes of chest pain
while at rest at work. This pain was associated with pain under
his arms as well as SOB but no nausea, diaphoresis, or
lightheadedness. The episodes lasted 1-1.5 hours and resolved
spontaneously. Over the last 3 days he has had ~ 5 episodes.
Then yesterday evening, he was awoken from sleep with 10/10
chest pain again ass. w/ pain under the arms and SOB. His wife
called 911 and he was brought to OSH ED. He received 3 SL NTG in
transport and by the time of arrival to the ED, his CP had
resolved. Patient estimates ~1 hr of chest pain. Per pt's
friend, he may have been complaining of chest pain >1 week ago
although he did not report to his family.
.
In the OSH ED, patient was chest pain free. By report, although
not available, ECG showed NSR w/ nonspecific ST-TW changes,
inferior QWs. CKs were negative but troponins were mildly
elevated at 0.16. He was evaluated by Cardiology, started on
heparin and NTG gtt for possible unstable angina/ACS. CXR showed
moderate CHF and he was dialyzed w/ 2 kgs removed. He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Upon arrival, patient appears comfortable. He denies any further
chest pain since his last episode was relieved w/ SL NTG prior
to arrival at [**Hospital3 **]. He reports his breathing improved
since his dialysis. He is otherwise without complaint. On review
of symptoms, he denies any fevers, chills, nightsweats,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, or urinary complaints.
As above, he does note DOE and orthopnea. He denies any recent
LE swelling, syncope, or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
.
ECG [**2158-3-11**]: NSR @ 70. LAD. QWs in II, III, aVF, V1-3. TWI aVL.
J point elevation V3. < [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V6. Compared to
prior ECG [**2156-1-9**], nonspecific STTW changes are new.
.
[**2155-6-20**] Echo: Abnormal study c/w mild to moderate calcific AS
with mild AI and mild LVH. Mitral and tricuspid valves appear
normal.
.
[**2155-6-4**] ETT: Patient exercised for 10:51 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
protocol to an APHR of 94%. No EKG changes. No chest pain.
Images revealed normal regional wall motion. LVEF 67%.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2155-12-29**] demonstrated:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
patient revealed no angiographically significant coronary artery

disease. The LMCA had a mild distal 20% taper. The LAD was
normal.
The LCX had mild luminal irregularities. The RCA also had mild
luminal irregularities.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevation of left sided filling

pressures with a LVEDP of 20mmHG and a PCWP of 15mmHG. There was
mild pulmonary hypertension with a mean PA pressure of 25mmHG.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.72l/m2/min
3. There was a severe aortic stenosis gradient with mean
gradient of 41mmHG and calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of .79cm2. The aortic
valve appeared calcified on fluoroscopy.

CXR-portable AP ([**2158-3-11**]) - Cardiac size is top normal.  The
mediastinal contours are unchanged.  The patient is post median
sternotomy.  There are low lung volumes.  There is mild
interstitial pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
are greater in the right side.  Left upper lobe opacity abutting
the pleural surface with loss of volume is grossly unchanged.
IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Chronic changes
in the left upper lobe.
.
ECHO-TTE ([**2158-3-14**]) - The left atrium is mildly dilated. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is higher than
expected for this type of prosthesis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
