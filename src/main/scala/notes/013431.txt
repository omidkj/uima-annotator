Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain with abnormal cardiac stress test transferred for
cardiac cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with PCI to distal LAD with bare metal
stent

History of Present Illness:
67 M with a history of spina bifida complicated by paraplegia,
hydrocephalus with a VP shunt, colitis s/p colostomy, stage III
decub on the buttocks, barrett's esophagus, 2 prior cardiac
caths with normal coronaries (last in [**2182**]), who presents from
an OSH for cardiac catheterization after an abnormal stress
test. The patient presented to his PCP's office with chest pain
on [**2187-8-30**]. The patient was sent to [**Hospital3 7569**]. His pain
resolved with SL NTG. He was ruled out for an MI negative
cardiac enzymes. A stress test completed on [**2187-8-31**] revealed a
reversible anteroseptal apical wall defect and a fixed
inferolateral wall defect with an EF of 32%. He was placed on a
nitroglycerin drip (2cc/hr, 12mcg/min), clopidogrel 75mg QD
(started on [**2187-9-1**] without loading dose) held in the morning
prior to cath, and aspirin.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath that revealed 60% distal
LAD lesion, OM2 w/ 50% lesion, and no obstructive disease in
LMCA and RCA. The LAD lesion was stented with a BMS. The cath
was notable for difficult access in the right groin and
eventually the left groin was used. He was admitted from the
cath lab to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3, but shortly after
arriving to the floor he developed a large hematoma in the right
groin. His BP was noted to have dropped from 140s systolic on
arrival to the floor to 100s. HR was stable in the 60s-70s.
Pressure was held for more than 1 hour. An central line in the
left groin was placed. The arterial sheath in the left groin was
left in for a-line readings. A stat Hct from the a-line was 29;
last Hct from OSH was 33.8. The pt was given 1U PRBC and
transferred to the CCU for further monitoring.

Pertinent Results:
.
CARDIAC CATH [**2187-9-3**]:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated a one vessel and a branch vessel CAD.  The LMCA had
no flow
limiting lesions.  The LAD had a 60% distal stenosis.  The LCx
had no
obstructive disease in the main vessel but had a 50% stenosis in
the OM2
branch.  The RCA was free of angiographically apparent
epicardial
disease.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Successful PCI of the distal LAD with a 2.0x12mm bare metal
stent
deployed at 14 atm with excellent final results.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel and a branch vessel CAD.
2. Successful PCI of the distal LAD with a bare metal stent
.
ECHO [**2187-9-4**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Basal systolic
function appears good. The more distal segments could not be
visualized (no apical or subcostal windows). A mid-ventricular
lateral wall motion abnormality is suggested in some views, but
could not be confirmed. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2181-9-14**], symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy is suggested, and a regional wall motion abnormality
cannot be excluded.
.
If clinically indicated, a RVG/MUGA scan or cardiac MRI
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9559**]) would be better able to assess regional and
global left ventricular systolic function.
