Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital1 **] for pericardiocentesis with pigtail
catheter placement.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization
Pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement [**2153-1-1**]
Right thoracentesis [**2153-1-3**]
Left thoracentesis [**2153-1-5**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old male with history of hyperlipidemia
and GERD, who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 **] for
urgent pericardiocentesis with drain placement.  His symptoms
began 1 week prior to admission, when he awoke with malaise,
cough, and sore throat.  His malaise became worse through the
week, and he complained of fevers/chills, as well as n/v/d the
day before presentation to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2152-12-30**].  + anorexia.

At [**Location (un) 620**] he was noted to be tachycardic to 110 bpm, and
hypoxic at 92% on RA, though afebrile.  A CXR revealed RLL and
RUL infiltrates, and his wbc count was 13.2 with mild L shift.
Rapid influenza was negative, and he was started on levaquin,
later changed to ceftriaxone and zithromax.  He was additionally
noted to be in ARF with creatinine 1.8.  Clinically he worsened
rapidly; on the second day of admission he was noted to be
dyspneic, cyanotic, with ABG 7.45/19/65, and patient intubated
with serosanguinous secretions.  An echo done later that night
showed a large pericardial effusion, and decision was made to
transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for pericardiocentesis and pigtail
catheter placement.

On [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] patient's family, he was in his usual state of
health prior to this illness.  They deny that he complained of
any previous cough, no previous n/v/d, no anorexia or weight
loss.  He did have hematochezia approximately 3 weeks ago,
however attributed it to a hemorrhoid, and it resolved.  Last
colonoscopy 1 year ago, normal per wife.  Unsure if he has ever
had a PPD test.  Smoked 2 PPD x 30 years, but quit 13 years ago.


Past Medical History:
Hyperlipidemia, on lipitor.
GERD, on a PPI or H2 blocker - unsure.

Social History:
"Heavy" smoker until 13 years ago - smoked 2 PPD x 30 years.
Also used to be an alcoholic, but quit 20 years ago.  Uncertain
PPD status.  Last colonoscopy 1 year ago, normal.

Married to his second wife, 2 children.

Family History:
Did not elicit.

IMAGING:

Cardiac cath [**2152-12-31**]:  COMMENTS:
  1. Baseline right atrial pressure was markedly elevated with a
mean
pressure of 30 mmHg.  Upon entry into the pericardial space, the

pericardial pressure was entrained with the RA pressure tracing
(mean of
30 mmHg).  A promenent pulsus paradoxus was noted in the femoral

arterial tracing, all signs consistent with pericardial
tamponade.
  2. Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of
approximately 800 cc
of grossly bloody fluid.  The last 200 cc of fluid were bright
red, with
a saturation of 95%.
  3. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated minimal luminal

irregularities, with no obstructive lesions in the LMCA, LAD,
LCX, or
RCA.
  4. Left ventriculography demonstrated normal ventricular
systolic
function.
  5. Post-pericardiocentesis hemodynamics demonstrated marked
respiratory variation in the intracardiac pressure tracings,
with
pericardial pressure of 10mmHg, and RA pressure remaining
elevated.  The
PCWP was elevated at 18mmHg, and the cardiac index was
low-normal.  The
patient's blood pressure was markedly improved at the end of the

procedure.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are angiographically normal.
2. Normal LV wall motion
3. Cardiogenic shock
4. Severe pericardial tamponade, successfully
drained by pericardiocentesis
5. Effusive constrictive syndrome.

Chest Portable [**2153-1-1**]:  IMPRESSION: Widened mediastinum and
rounded enlargement of the right hilar contours, concerning for
lymphadenopathy from a neoplastic process. TB is also a
possibility. Correlative contrast enhanced chest CT may be
helpful for better assessment if warranted clinically, as
communicated to the clinical house staff caring for the patient.

Multifocal pulmonary opacities most prominent in the right upper
lobe and retrocardiac portions of the lower lobes, which may be
due to the history of pneumonia.
