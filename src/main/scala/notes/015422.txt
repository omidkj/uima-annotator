Brief Hospital Course:
1) Hypertensive Urgency:
Likely due to his inability to take medications because of n/v.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be withrawing from Klonopin or methadone but no clear
evidence of this. No blood in U/A.  Pt admitted to ICU and
placed on nitro drip.  His outpt labetalol was increased to 400
[**Hospital1 **] with some improvement.  Nitro gtt was weaned off.  As BP
remained high, hydralazine was initially added.  He was
continued on clonidine and ACEI.  Hydralazine was not working
very well so switched to nifedipine (low dose).  With this
regimen of labetalol, nifedipine, clonidine, and lisinopril his
overall BP was well controlled.  He continued to have some
excursions of SBP up to 160s particularly in AM prior to meds.
It is likely anxiety was contributing as well.
Pt should have complete workup for secondary HTN as outpt as
many of the labs are sendouts.  Some of this ie MRA kidneys has
already been done.
.
2) N/V/Diarrhea:
Likely viral gastroenteritis, although time course appears
prolonged.  CT abd negative for other acute process.  He had a
low grade temperature (<101) to go along with viral infection.
Pt did not provide stool sample.  But diarrhea and vomiting
resolved and he was tolerating POs.  He did have some mild
nausea remaining.
.
3) Chest Pain:
Negative cardiac enzymes and no EKG changes made cardiac
ischemia very unlikely. Reproducible with palpation.
.
4) Anemia:
Stable microcytic anemia. Iron studies, B12, folate wnl.  Hct
was stable so no further workup done as inpatient.
.
5) h/o Substance abuse:
He is on methadone 130 mg daily. He gets his methadone from
outpatient methadone maintenance clinic [**Street Address(1) 10972**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10971**]. He is also on klonopin 2mg TID.
