History of Present Illness:
27-year-old male with a history of CLL status post allogeneic
transplant in early [**2111**] complicated by graft-versus-host

presenting in septic shock from OSH.  The patient was seen on

with 6% bands, Hct of 24.2, Cr of 1.2 (up from 0.7 on [**8-10**]) and

found by his VNA to be lethargic, hypotensive, and febrile.  He
was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where he was hypotensive to the
70s, febrile to 103.2 and hypoxic to 91% on NRB.  He got IVF
boluses and started on levophed.  CXR showed bilateral lower
lobe opacities.  Labs showed WBC of 0.8, H/H [**5-17**] and 16.2.  He
got vanco, cefepime, hydrocort 100mg IV, 2 units PRBC, was
intubated, and Med flighted to [**Hospital1 18**].
