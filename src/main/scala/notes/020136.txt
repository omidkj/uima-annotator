Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2120-8-2**] - Removal of right atrial clot, Removal of pacemaker,
Closure of PFO, Placement of epicardial right ventricular leads
x2 with permenant pacemeaker,

History of Present Illness:
79 yo M with h/o RUE DVT, AFib on coumadin, PCM with h/o
infection, was brought to ED at [**Location (un) 11248**] [**Hospital3 **] in
NH on [**7-26**] after having passed out at shopping mall. Was found
bradycardic and hypotensive. CTA showed bilateral pulmonary
embolism with a large embolus in the L main stem PA. INR on
admission was 2.6, Cr 1.6, WBC 20.7 with 66.7%PMNs. LENI's were
negative but B upper ext U/S's revealed a 90% R subclavian vein
stenosis associated with pacer lead. The L subclavian/axillary
was patent with atretic with thickened calcified wall c/w
post-phlebitic changes. There appeared to be good collateral
flow around both subclavian systems, suggesting mostly chronic
condition. The vascular service at the OSH felt that the R
subclavian likely had the acute DVT which traveled to the
pulmonary artery. Echo showed large RA thrombus occupying approx
2/3rds of the RA.
    At the OSH he initially required Bipap to keep O2sats up and
was given Solumedrol. He was started on Vancomycin empirically
for leukocytosis with concern for infection of PCM leads. This
was later changed to Linezolid given concern that vanc had
caused renal failure? He was started on IV heparin and given
coumadin, aspirin 81, and plavix 75. Cr was seen to rise to 4.0.
Moxifloxacin was added on [**7-28**]. Troponin was initially 0.03 and
rose to 0.37. He is now admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

[**2120-8-2**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrial appendage
emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s).
2. The right atrium is markedly dilated. A mass/thrombus
associated with a catheter/pacing wire is seen in the right
atrium.
3. The right atrial appendage ejection velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s).
4. A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is seen
at rest. A
small secundum atrial septal defect is present.
5. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
6. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
7. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
8. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
9. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
10.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: Pt is in SVT at a rate of 110, Pt is receiving and
infusion of Phenylephrine and Epinephrine.
1. The Thrombus and the pacing wire in the RA are no longer
seen.
2. RV function is severely depressed. LV function appears
hyperdynamics and LV appears underfilled.

[**2120-7-31**] Abdominal Ultrasound
1. Splenomegaly.
2. Trace ascites.
3. Poor visualization of the pancreas secondary to overlying
bowel gas.

[**2120-7-30**] Radiology
Successful placement of a temporary right femoral vein 3 port
hemodialysis catheter, with the tip positioned in the IVC. The
catheter is ready to use.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 55086**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of
his right atrial clot and pulmonary embolism. Heparin and plavix
were continued for anticoagulation despite being therapeutic on
coumadin. Steroids and nebulizer treatments were given to
improve his hypoxia with good results. Given the nature of his
clot in relation to his pacemaker, the cardiac surgical service
was consulted for surgical removal of his pacer lead and atrial
clot. Mr. [**Known lastname 55086**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner
and despite being such high risk, it was elected to proceed. The
electrophysiology service was consulted for interrogation of his
pacemaker and to make adjustments to assist with his
hypotension. Given his acute renal failure, the renal service
was consulted. A temporary line was placed for hemodialysis by
the radiology service. As a hypercoagulable state was suspected,
appropriate studies were sent per the hematology service. On
[**2120-8-2**], Mr. [**Known lastname 55086**] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent removal of a right atrial clot, closure of PFO,
placement of pacer leads and placement of a new pacemaker.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. An emergency echocardiogram was
obtained for deteriorating hemodynamics. No significant
pericardial effusion was seen however mobile thrombus was seen
in the right atrium. His sternum was opened at the bedside and
CPR was initiated with success. His family was made aware of the
grave situation and supportive care was withdrawn. Mr. [**Known lastname 55086**] [**Last Name (Titles) 69415**]d shortly thereafter on [**2120-8-3**].
