Admission Date:  [**2164-12-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2164-12-29**]

Date of Birth:   [**2118-1-6**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  New myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46 year old Caucasian
female with a past medical history of coronary artery
disease, three vessel disease with a recent myocardial
infarction in [**2164-10-16**], and an echocardiogram revealing
questionable mural thrombus who presented to [**Hospital6 3426**] on [**2164-12-22**], with left sided chest pain and
dizziness.  She was found by her mother the morning of
presentation and brought to [**Hospital6 33**] for further
evaluation.

At [**Hospital6 33**], the patient was noted to have a
blood sugar of 1200 and laboratories consistent with diabetic
ketoacidosis, acute renal failure with creatinine of 2.4,
baseline creatinine of 1.5.  Her electrocardiogram was
notable for new right bundle branch block, inferior ST
depression, anterior T wave changes, new as compared to
recent electrocardiogram.

She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit there where she
was treated for diabetic ketoacidosis with intravenous fluids
and insulin drips.  She was treated for the new non ST
elevation myocardial infarction with Aspirin but no beta
blocker secondary to her low blood pressure.

At that point, the hospital course was complicated for new
altered mental status. She has chronic anticoagulation with
Coumadin and CT of the head was conducted to rule out
intracerebral hemorrhage.  The first CT had questionable
changes along the tentorium cerebelli and thus the Heparin
was held until [**2164-12-23**], when repeat head CT was negative.
Lumbar puncture and electroencephalogram were not done.
Neurology was consulted and they suggested that the altered
mental status was secondary to toxic metabolic causes.

Of note, the patient's peak CK was 498, MB 86 and troponin
3.16 at the outside hospital and repeat electrocardiogram
showed resolution of the inferior depressions.  Of note also
at the outside hospital, she was on intravenous Vancomycin
and Tequin for questionable infection of her outer ear as a
cause of her diabetic ketoacidosis.

1.  Coronary artery disease, three vessel, myocardial
infarction in [**2163-11-17**], and [**2164-10-16**].

2.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, the patient had a chest x-ray
that showed poor inspiration, small bilateral effusions.  She
had a head CT at the outside hospital which showed bilateral
symmetric postthalamic calcifications but no hemorrhage.

She had the following laboratories apparently on admission to
[**Hospital1 69**]:  Sodium 124, potassium
4.7, chloride 93, bicarbonate 21, blood urea nitrogen 47,
creatinine 1.7, glucose 193, calcium 8.4, phosphorus 4.6.
She had an AST of 26, ALT 22, alkaline phosphatase 165, total
bilirubin 0.2.  CK on admission was 381, MB 57, albumin 3.1,
troponin 3.16.  Prothrombin time was 31.3, partial
thromboplastin time 45.4 and INR 4.4.  Her white blood cell
count was 12.1, hematocrit 33.7, platelet count 310,000.

She had an echocardiogram in [**2164-9-16**], which showed
severe regional wall left ventricular dysfunction with an
akinetic distal one half septum, distal one third of anterior
inferior wall.  The apex is akinetic.  There was question for
small mural thrombus, 1+ mitral regurgitation, and ejection
fraction of 25%.

Electrocardiogram on [**2164-12-22**], which showed normal sinus
rhythm at 76 beats per minute, normal PR interval, QRS
greater than 120, right bundle branch block, right axis
deviation, T wave inversion V1 through V3, questionable ST
depressions in V4 through V6.  Compared with [**2164-10-6**], she
had new right bundle branch block, T wave inversions and ST
depressions and new right axis deviation.

The patient had other studies of significance including the
following:  Repeat echocardiogram on [**2164-12-26**], showed no
mural thrombus.  The echocardiogram also demonstrated left
ventricular ejection fraction of 20 to 25%, basically
unchanged from [**2164-10-16**], and without further akinesis or
hypokinesis.

In addition, the patient underwent an x-ray of her left lower
leg which demonstrated a continuous nonhealing fracture of
the tibia and fibula.

Two days prior to discharge, the patient had the following
laboratory values:  White blood cell count 8.6, hematocrit
32.9.  Chem7 revealed sodium 132, potassium 4.7, chloride 95,
bicarbonate 23, blood urea nitrogen 24, creatinine 1.0,
glucose 236, calcium 9.0, magnesium 2.1, phosphorus 5.7 and
the day of discharge she had an INR of 1.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular - The patient was treated conservatively
with beta blockers, ace inhibitors, Heparin and Aspirin and
remained chest pain free the majority of her remaining
hospital stay.  As mentioned previously, her repeat
echocardiogram showed no change in her cardiac function and
demonstrated no mural thrombus.  She gradually became volume
overloaded through the course of her hospital course and
required diuresis for the last three hospital days.

2.  Endocrine - The patient presented to the outside hospital
with blood sugar in the 1200 range.  She was treated
conservatively with intravenous fluids and insulin drip and
her blood sugar gradually came into the 200 to 300 range the
remainder of her hospital stay.  Her blood sugar is extremely
brittle and very difficult to control but she had no further
complications from the diabetes through the hospital stay.

3.  Hematology - The patient had previously been
anticoagulated for akinesis related to her previous
myocardial infarction and she remained stable through the
course of her hospital stay.  Per cardiology, she had a
target INR of 1.8 for three months following discharge and
then a goal of 1.5 following those three months.  In
addition, she has a chronic anemia likely secondary to iron
deficiency and chronic renal insufficiency.  She is to be
treated with Ironist 2.5 mg injections once a week.

4.  Dermatology - The patient has a history of dermatitis
herpetiformis recently controlled with Niacinamide and
Minocycline and Ultravate cream.  She was treated with these
medications during her hospital stay and the rash remained
stable.  The patient also had a lesion on her right anthelix
which was biopsied and showed subcellular atypia and needs to
be rescheduled for biopsy by dermatology as an outpatient.

5.  Renal - The patient has a baseline renal insufficiency
with a creatinine of roughly 1.5.  She was hydrated through
the course of her hospital stay and her creatinine was at
baseline the day of discharge.  She had intermittent rise in
her creatinine during the hospital stay presumed due to a
prerenal state as it corrected with volume repletion.  She
also has chronic hyponatremia and her sodium remained around
130s through her hospital stay.

6.  Gastroenterology - The patient has a history of
gastroparesis and irritable bowel syndrome.  She tolerated
p.o. through her full stay in the hospit
