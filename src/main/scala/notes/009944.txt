Allergies:
Iodine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 317**]
Chief Complaint:
shakiness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
87 F with PMH breast ca s/p bilateral mastectomy with chronic
sternal wound x 25 years who came into ED because she felt her
heart racing this am and felt weak at the same time. She states
that she laid down, but that she did not feel better, so she
came to ED. Of note, she was seen over weekend on [**4-29**] for ?
allergic reaction to food product treated with benadryl. At that
time, the ED doctors also started the patient on dicloxacillin
for a ? of sternal wound infection. Per patient, the wound looks
unchanged from baseline.  She has chronic erythema of wound and
cleans it daily and covers it with silver sulfadizene and gauze.
Her caregiver did comment on ? odor coming from wound.

In ED, CXR concerning for pneumonia. Felt patient needed to be
admitted for RLL pneumonia. However, recent CT scan notable for
scarring secondary to radiation changes that correspond to the
same area in right lung. In addition, pt was given Lopressor 5
IV, levaquin 500 mg, asa, heparin gtt, sl ntg and morphine.

ROS: no cp, sob, doe, cough, f/c/ dysuria, BRBPR, black stool. +
abd pain, midepigastric. normal BM.

Stress [**1-21**]: P-MIBI:
vague left arm tightness post infusion. 1-3 mm of ST segment
depression noted in V1-V3 which is difficult to interpret due to
RBBB. MIBI windows with:
1) Moderate, partially reversible defect involving the
inferolateral wall.
2) Moderate, fixed defect involving the inferior wall.
3) Normal left ventricular cavity size. Inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis.  Ejection fraction 47%.
.
CXR ([**2180-5-2**]):diffuse hazy  opacity  involving  the  right  lung
 mostly  the upper  zone per radiology, but entire lobe per my
read.  Osteopenia  of  the  surrounding  osseous  structures  is
 present. small left sided pleural effusion versus haziness.
.
CT chest([**2180-5-10**]): Small bilateral pleural effusions, left
greater than right. Minimal  interval  increase  in  the  linear
 scarring  along  the  medial  right lung,  which  may  relate
to  prior  radiation  changes  in  this  region.
There is an unchanged mixed lucent-sclerotic pattern of the
bilateral clavicles and sternum.

PROCEDURE DATE: [**2180-5-5**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease, Canadian Heart Class IV, unstable.
Prior q
wave inferior MI, [**2180-1-20**]. Prior PTCA [**2178-2-2**]. Positive stress
test.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderated diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Right IABP placed.
4. Successful PCI of the LMCA/LAD/LCX with kissing drug-eluting
stents.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a left dominant
system with
three vessel coronary artery disease. The short, large diameter
LMCA had
no angiographically apparent flow limiting lesions. The LAD had
a 90%
origin lesion prior to the stent. The LCX had a 95% lesion prior
to the
stent. The RCA was nondominant.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderately elevated
left
sided pressures (LVEDP 23 mmHg) with a 10 mm gradient across the
aortic
valve.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. A 7 French 30cc intraaortic balloon pump was placed via the
right
femoral artery.
5. Successful PCI of the LMCA into the LAD and LCX with kissing
3.0 x
18 mm Cypher DES (LAD) and 3.5 x 18 mm Cypher DES (LCX).

Brief Hospital Course:
1) CAD: Patient presented with NSTEMI.  Cath demonstrated in
stent re-stenosis of bare metal stents.  2 kissing Cypher stents
to LAD and LCx were placed and the patient was transferred to
the CCU on IABP.  Her CCU course was uneventful, the IABP was
DCed and she was transferred to the floor.  Meds as below were
titrated:\
- carvedilol 12.5 po BID
- lisinopril 5mg PO QD
- heparin gtt
- ASA 81 initially given concern of GIB; per attending, 325 on
discharge, plavix 75
.
2) CHF, EF 30-47%
- Maintained on digoxin, coreg, lasix.
- daily weights were obtained to help tailor diuresis
- 2 g NaCL diet was maintained
.
3) Rhythm: NSR without major events on tele.
.
4) Valves: AS, valve area 1.7.
.
5) Recent GIB: [**12-22**] esophageal ulcer was felt to be [**12-22**] fosamax
and angioectasias, not fully visualized because of bleedind
during urgent endoscopy in [**3-23**]. Not cauterized.
- ASA 325 and plavix 75 w/caution.
