Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5301**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
61 yo M with severe COPD ([**3-11**] FEV1 14% FVC 39%) on 4L NC at
home, [**Month/Year (2) 1291**], trachomalacia, HTN, h/o HIT, who now presents with
worsening shortness of breath.  Patient reports many weeks of
difficulty breathing and productive cough.  Also has been
coughing up flecks of blood 2-3 times a day x weeks.
.
Last saw Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] (pulmonologist) 2 weeks ago who placed him on
increased prednisone 10mg qday + Z-pak.  Patient did not improve
and refused to come into the hospital.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] increased his
prednisone to 40mg qday with good effect.  He began a steroid
taper [**2139-3-19**] and a course of biaxin.
.
In the ED the patient was found to have a sat of 99% on neb.  He
was given methylpred 125mg x 1 and nebs with temporary releif of
symptoms.  Switched to BiPAP with good effect and transferred to
MICU.
.
On arrival to the floor the patient was satting 95 % on neb.
However he quickly became air hungry with sats dropping to the
high 80's.  BiPAP was initiated.
.
The patient denied fevers, chills, BP, abd pain, N/V, diarrhea,
HA, change in vision/hearing, confusion, dysuria, hematuria.

Family History:

Physical Exam:
VS - 96.8 (ax)  140/83  112  20  95% @ neb
Gen - a+ox3, dyspneic
HEENT - OP clear, EOMI
Neck - supple, no LAD
Cor - RRR, [**3-10**] sys murmur LUSB
Chest - extremely poor air movement, almost no breath sounds
Abd - s/nt/nd +BS
Ext - w/wp, no c/c/e


Pertinent Results:
[**3-24**] CT chest: IMPRESSION: Peribronchial multifocal interstitial
abnormality progressing since [**2138-12-3**], was not present in
[**2138-5-3**], is consistent with developing interstitial lung
disease/interstitial pneumonitis
.
Moderate to severe emphysema.
.
Enlarging left adrenal mass, concerning for neoplasm.
.
Simple left renal cyst.
.
[**3-27**] Echo: Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed. There is no ventricular septal defect. There
is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic
aortic valve leaflets are thickened. The transaortic gradient is
higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**2-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-12-30**],
the patient is now in rapid atrial fibrillation. The LVEF now
appears depressed and the severity of aortic valve prosthesis
stenosis has slightly increased. A repeat study after HR control
or cardioversion is suggested to better quantify LVEF. A TEE may
better characterize intrinsic aortic prosthetic valve stenosis.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 61 yo M with severe COPD ([**3-11**] FEV1 14% FVC 39%) on 4L NC at
home, [**Month/Year (2) 1291**], trachomalacia, HTN, h/o HIT, who now presents with
worsening shortness of breath.
.
# Dyspnea
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient with exacerbation of already severe
emphysema. Trigger of exacerbation thought most likely secondary
to a URI or tapering of steroids. Patient was initially
maintained on BiPap and was eventually weaned from that. Patient
was then transferred to the floor where he remained stable on
4.5L with scheduled nebs and PO steroids. Patient also
maintained on spiriva, advair, [**Last Name (LF) 8895**], [**First Name3 (LF) 130**].
Patient also completed doxycycline (avoid macrolide [**3-6**] QT; PCN
allergic).
.
# Leukocytosis
Patient with elevated WBC, most likely secondary to steroids.
Patient was without signs of infection. Patient also had 3
induced sputums which demonstrated negative PCP and acid fast
staining. Patient was maintained on doxycycline for treatment of
possible pneumonia.
.
# Elevated Troponin
Chronically elevated trop for unclear reasons.  No symptoms of
ischemia.  EKG only with mild ST dep II/III.  CK/MB flat.
.
# Afib - Patient was initially in sinus rhythym being maintained
on procainamide. However, while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was in
atrial fibrillation with RVR and was initially transferred from
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 for starting dofetilide with cardioversion
with the last procainamide dose 2/23 at 10am. However, after
discussion with attending, family and EP fellow, decided against
initiation of dofetilide [**3-6**] risk of Torsades, need to reverse
DNR status and low success rate. Goal now is to achieve rate
control with diltiazem and digoxin. With consultation with
Electrophysiology, patient was then started on norpace. He was
monitored for 48 hours for evaluation of QT prolongation, which
demonstrated no significant QT prolongation.  Patient was not
maintained on anticoagulation given GI bleed.
.
# HTN - Patient was maintained on PO diltiazem with good control
of hypertension.
.
# h/o HIT - avoid all heparin products during the admission
.
# BPH: Patient was maintained on detrol.
