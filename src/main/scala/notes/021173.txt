Chief Complaint:
intermittant abdominal and back pain for 10 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm S/p repair [**2170-6-14**]


History of Present Illness:
83 yo M s/p EVAR in [**7-/2163**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18835**] for an infrarenal
AAA. He has been lost to follow up since that time. He has been
c/o intermittant abdominal and back pain for the last 10 days,
with an acute increase in pain at around 6PM this evening. He
was
seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**6-11**] and a NC CT was obtained, showing
enlargement of the AAA from ~ 5x5 to ~ 7x7. His symptoms were
thought to be due to constipation and he was sent home
recommendations to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22426**] in [**Hospital **] clinic ASAP.
A
repeat NC CT was done this evening, due to his CRI, which showed
the enlarged AAA with extravasation of high-density fluid
anteriorly. The AAA also appears to now involve the renal
arteries B. He arrived in the ED hypertensive with SBP >200. We
have since given him Labetalol and he is now on a Nitro gtt for
BP control, goal SBP <100. He is currently mentating. We have
discussed the gravity of this situation and he wishes us to
proceed with an attempt at operative repair.

Abd./Pelvis CT: New stranding and high-attenuation fluid
surrounding large abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is slightly
increased in size since very recent exam of [**2170-6-11**]. Of note,
the stent endograft has migrated significantly inferiorly since
previous contrast-enhanced scan of [**2167-2-25**]. While no evidence of
intramural hemorrhage, active endoleak or extravasation of
contrast is seen, these findings are concerning, and may
represent impending leak or rupture. Alternatively, the
inflammation surrounding the aortic aneurysm could represent a
process such as aortitis (though no evidence of such was seen as
recently as three days before).
