Imaging:
CXR [**3-29**]:  Mild CHF with right fissural fluid and left pleural
effusion, similar to prior study.
CXR [**4-1**]: 1. New mild pulmonary edema. Stable small pleural
effusions and mild cardiomegaly.
2. No evidence of pneumonia.
CXR [**4-3**]: Mild pulmonary edema is worsened on the right,
improved slightly on the left, moderate right and small left
pleural effusions have substantially increased, particularly the
right. Moderate cardiac enlargement is longstanding. The patient
has prior mitral and aortic valve replacement, congenital right
aortic arch. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular
pacer leads are unchanged in standard placements. No
pneumothorax.
.
Liver/GB U/S [**4-3**]: 1. Simple cholelithiasis without acute
cholecystitis.
2. Unchanged dilated CBD measure up to 12 mm.
3. Unchanged dilated hepatic veins.
4. Small amount of ascites and bilateral pleural effusions.
.
Pelvic U/S [**4-7**]: 1. 6.5 cm left adnexal cystic lesion only
minimally increased in size compared to [**2130**] with no concerning
features
2. Trace free pelvic fluid.
.
Humerus Xray [**4-10**]: Again noted is a supracondylar fracture with
increased resorption at the fracture site. There is no
radiographic finding to suggest [**Hospital1 **] at this time. There is
approximately 7-mm gap at the medial fracture on the external
rotation view.
.
KUB [**4-10**]: Four total images are submitted. These are somewhat
limited on the basis of technique and patient positioning, but
are the best images are available, given these limitations.
Dual-lead pacemaker and valvular prosthesis again identified.
There is a large amount of stool throughout the colon. No
discrete obstruction is identified. Air-filled small bowel is
also identified, but this does not appear to be pathologically
dilated at this time.
.
EKGs:
[**3-29**]: A-V sequential pacing. Since the previous tracing of
[**2134-3-13**] changes in early precordial QRS voltage is of uncertain
significance. Clinical correlation is suggested.
[**4-2**]: A-V sequentially paced rhythm and intermittent ventricular
pacing. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2134-3-31**] atrial
pacemaker activiy is now recorded.
[**4-6**]:Probably both sinus and atrial pacing with at least one
atrial premature beat. There is ventricular pacing throughout.
Since the previous tracing of [**2134-4-2**] the atrial rate is faster.
Clinical correlation is suggested.
[**4-8**]: Sinus rhythm competing with atrial pacing with ventricular
pacing. Compared to the previous tracing there is no significant
change.
