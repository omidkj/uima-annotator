History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11135**] is a 80 yo man with known CAD s/p anterior MI [**2184**],
who has resisted cardiac catheterization in the past and has
been medically managed for some time. He was in his usual state
of health until the morning of admission where he reported chest
pain that woke him from sleep. He took Aspirin without relief
and called EMS. Found to have EKG changes and was treated with
the STEMI protocol including Heparin, Integrilin, Aspirin,
Plavix, Nitro and beta blockade with improvement in symptoms. He
was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization.

[**2190-8-5**] Cardiac Catheterization: 1. Coronary angiography in
this right dominant system demonstarted three vessel coronary
artery disease. The LMCA had a 40% distal stenosis. The LAD had
severe diffuse stenosis proxiamlly, the mid LAD is totally
occluded after the septal branch. The distal LAD fills with left
to right collaterals. The LCx has a 90% proximal stenosis, the
distal LCx has a subtotal occlusion supplying 2 PL branches. The
OM1 had an 80% stenosis. The RCA had a proximal 90% stenosis. 2.
LEFT VENTRICULOGRAPHY: LV end diastolic volume index 44.54(nl
50-90 ml/m2). LV end systolic volume index 27.23 (nl 15-30
ml/m2). LV stroke volume index 17.31 (nl 35-75 ml/m2). LV
ejection fraction 39% (nl 50%-80%). 3. Other findings: Mitral
valve was normal. Aortic valve was normal.
[**2190-8-6**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20 %). 2. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated.
3. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending
thoracic aorta is  mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. 4. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral  regurgitation is seen. 6. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened.
POST-BYPASS:
Pt off CPB on levophed and milrinone gtt.
1. Maintained biventricular function EF 20-25%.
2. Minimal improvement in septal and anterior septal wall
performance.
3. Mitral regurgiation unchanged.
4. Aortic contours are intact.
5. An IABP was passed over a wire with TEE guidance.
Well-positioned and
functional.
[**2190-8-11**] Brain MRI: A single small focus of T2/FLAIR
hyperintensity seen in the right cerebellum corresponding to an
area of bright signal on the diffusion-weighted images, but
without corresponding dark high or low signal on the ADC map,
most likely indicating a subacute infarction. Several foci of T2
and FLAIR prolongation in the corona radiata and periventricular
white matter of both cerebral hemispheres probably indicates
chronic microvascular change. The appearance of the ventricles
and sulci are normal. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation is
preserved.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11135**] was admitted and underwent urgent cardiac
catheterization which revealed severe three vessel disease and
severe diastolic left ventricular dysfunction. (Please see
result section for more detail). Given his critical coronary
anatomy and poor ventricular function, he was brought to the
operating room the following day and underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Operative course was notable for
cardiogenic shock which required placement of an IABP. For
additional surgical details, please see seperate dictated
operative note. Following the operation, he was brought to the
CSRU for invasive monitoring. He initially required multiple
inotropes to maintain hemodynamics. Given his critical
condition, he required prolong ventilation and sedation. Tube
feedings were eventually started to maintain nutritional
support. Over several days, his hemodynamics gradually improved
and pressor support was weaned. The IABP was removed on
postoperative day four without complication. Transaminases and
bilirubin were elevated which was attributed to shock liver
secondary to intraoperative hypotension. Abdominal ultrasound
was obtained which showed normal-appearing liver and biliary
tree. Platelet count also dropped as low as 32K but HIT assays
remained negative. Despite wean from sedation, he initially
remained relatively lethargic and unresponsive. The stroke
service was therefore consulted and MRI was obtained. MRI was
notable for a small focus of signal abnormality in the right
cerebellum, which likely corresponded to an infarction of
subacute age. Despite the above findings, the stroke s
