History of Present Illness:
This is a 49 yo M w/ h/o DVT x2 and hypertension who was
transferred from [**Hospital3 1280**] for bilateral PE with hemodynamic
instability.
.
Patient was walking upstair on AM of admission when he suddenly
syncopized. He was witnessed to fall to the ground after walking
up a flight of stairs and was unconscious and unresponsive for
approximately 2 to 3 minutes. He did not have any seizure
activity. He then woke up confused and diaphoretic. He denies
chest pain/SOB at that time. He was sent to [**Hospital1 **]. He was
hypoxic at 91% on RA and has BP of 80 over palp. Blood pressure
had been fluid responsive. CT chest revealed multiple large
bilateral PE (large proximal right mainstem thrombus and distal
left main thrombus, paucity of vessels R>L). Heparin was then
started. EKG showed S1Q3T3. HE also became hypotensive and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible thrombolysis. His initial VS
were T 96.3 P 79 BP 133/102 93% on RA.
.
According to him, he had right DVT 2 years ago in the setting of
multiple baseball injury to the same place. He could not recall
what medication he was on or how long he was on it. He again
have another DVT, this time on the left side discovered on
[**2115-9-7**] on the day that he was suppose to go for Archilles
tendon surgery. He went for the surgery and was on lovenox for 2
weeks after that (qd dosed). Reports a brother who "is
anticoagulated because he clots."  Female members of his family

Imaging:
ECHO [**2115-10-7**]:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation present.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Impression and plan:
49yo man with a history of 2 previous DVTs presented with
hemodynamically unstable bilateral pulmonary embolism,
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible tPA.
.
1.) Bilateral PE:  Pt was initially tranferred to [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital for ?tPA administration as was hemodynamically unstable
at previous hospital.  On presentation, the patient was volume
rescusitated and never became hemodynamically unstable -
therefore tPA was not administered.  Pt was started on heparin
drip to achieve therapeutic PTT of 60-100. Throughout hospital
course, the heparin drip ranged from 1000-1300units/hr.  Patient
was also started on Coumadin at 5mg PO qhs to goal INR [**3-14**].
Patient was discharge with INR = 2.0 with plans to continue
current Coumadin dose (5mg qhs) and will get 1 dose Lovenox 80mg
SC tonight, with plans to follow up in his [**Hospital 6435**] clinic on [**10-11**]
to recheck INR and adjust Coumadin dose as needed.  It is likely
that he will need anticoagulation for at least 1 year given that
this episode was in setting of trauma (clot was present prior to
OR for achilles repair; likely [**3-13**] trauma from the baseball), if
not life-long anticoagulation given that patient developed DVT
under the circumstances.  Our final recommendation to him was
for life long anticoagulation. He will follow up with hematology
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for re-check of hypercoaguable labs in a couple
months, again given the fact that the patient developed this
clot and ?family history of a brother with some clotting
disorder.
.
2.) Hypertension: Hypertension meds held during hospitalization
as presented with ?hemodynamic instability.  Pt advised to
restart all outpatient medications on discharge. .
