Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
 Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year-old man with CAD, chronic systolic CHF,
CKD, who p/w DOE and chest "burning" on exertion. For the last
several weeks the patient has been complaining of increased
fatigue. Prior to this the patient could walk about 1 walk, but
now becomes dyspnic w/ minimal exertion. He has PND and 2 pillow
orthopnea. No syncope, dizziness, URI symptoms. The patient also
has right sided chest pain that is best described as a "burning"
that starts in his back and radiates to his right chest. It is
worse w/ exertion and relieved w/ nitro. His SOB is also
relieved w/ rest and nitro.
.
Of note the patient was recently addmitted on [**11/2125**] for CHF
exacerbation and found to have new onset A. flutter. The patient
was diuresed and put on coumadin. He had a GI bleed and was
taken off of coumadin. He decided not to undergo GI evaluation
because the GI bleed stopped and he could not tolerate the prep.



Past Medical History:
CAD- as above
HTN
DM 2
Hypercholesterolemia
Peripheral vascular disease-aorto fem bypass in early 90s.
Carotid stenosis 60-69% right ICA stenosis, 70-79% left ICA
stenosis in [**7-/2125**]
Mixed sleep disorder
.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: +Diabetes, +Dyslipidemia, +Hypertension
.
CARDIAC HISTORY:
CAD history:
-Emergent CABG in [**2109**], with SVGs to OM1/2.
-Repeat CABG [**2117**] with LIMA-->LAD and SVG-->distal LAD. SVG-OM1

patent SVG om2 60% stenosis.
-Cath [**3-13**] stent to SVG-->OM.
-Repeat cath [**10-13**] in stent restenosis of vein graft stent rxd
with brachytherapy.
-Cath [**1-14**] 90% stenosis prior to stents in SVG-OM and 70% stent

stenosis. Repeat cyphering done.
-Repeat cath for CP in [**9-14**]. SVG-->OM2 occluded. PTCA/stent to

distal LMCA and LCx treating a 70% ostial lesion. 70% proximal
RCA stented.
-Repeat cath [**9-15**]- restenting of LMCA-->LCx (80%)
-Cath [**11-16**]- patent stent in the LMCA. The LAD had an 80% ostial

lesion, but the vessel filled well via LIMA graft. The LCX had a

70% focal instent restenosis at the LCX ostium; the OM1 had <50%

disease after insertion of the SVG; there was no other
significant disease in the LCX system. The RCA had 60% disease
in the acute marginal branch; there were 60% long lesions in the

mid and distal RCA. The 80% lesion in the LAD was dilated with a

3.0 x 8 High sail balloon. The lesion in the LCx was then
dilated with a 3.5 x 13 High sail balloon upto 29 ATM when the
*balloon ruptured*. It was decided not to proceed with stent
placement due to 2 layers of previously placed BMS and DES.
Final angiography demonstrated 10-20% residual stenosis and no
angiographic evidence of dissection, thrombus or perforation
with TIMI III flow in the distal vessel.

Echo: [**2126-3-12**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with infero-septal, inferior and
infero-lateral hypokinesis to akinesis. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-11-21**],
pulmonary hypertension is now detected.
.
[**2126-3-12**] CXR:
Moderate cardiomegaly has not changed since [**2125-11-21**].
The
heterogeneous consolidative abnormality in the right lower lung
is minimally improved, but persistence in light of diuresis
suggests it is not edema alone. Differential diagnosis includes
pulmonary hemorrhage and pneumonia. Pleural effusions if any are
small. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2126-3-11**] CXR:
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Haziness of the hila
bilaterally and
bilateral mainly lower lobe opacities associated with small
bilateral pleural effusions, are consistent with moderate
pulmonary edema. Sternal wires are aligned with unchanged
disruption of the most distal wires.
.
CT chest w/o: [**2126-3-14**]
1. Recurrent or progressive widespread, multifocal airspace
abnormality.
Differential includes pulmonary hemorrhage, drug reaction,
hypersensitivity pneumonitis . Clinical correlation is
recommended.
2. Mild mediastinal adenopathy is minimally worse, likely
reactive.
3. Coronary and aortic arch calcifications.
4. Mild vocal cord asymmetry with nodular prominence of the
right, warrants direct examination.




Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo M w/ CAD, s/p 2 CABGS, CKD, HTN, CHF, p/w DOE and atypical
CP
.
# CORONARIES:  Patient has known 3 vessel disease and numerous
CAD risk factors. HgBA1C is 7.4. Lipids panel normal. Patient
had increase in troponins, but not in CKMB. This like likly [**2-12**]
demand and decreased clearance from CKD. No indication for
cardiac catherization this admission. Patient told to continue
his ASA, Plavix, Statin, beta blocker, ACE-I.
.
# PUMP: Echo repeated and showed EF of 30%. Patinet was
initially fluid overloaded and diuresed with lasix gtt. However,
at one point patient was likely overly diuresed and had
hypotension. He was sent to the CCU overnight for monitoring,
but quickly regained his baseline blood pressures and
transferred back to the floor. He was started on levaquin for
possible CAP given that he had a low grade temp of 100.4 the
night prior. He will finish his course of levaquin. Initially
patient was on 5-10L face tent but was discharged on RA. Patient
to continue on lisinopril, Isosorbide mononitrate, metoprolol,
nifedipine, HCTZ, and home dose of lasix.
.
# RHYTHM:  Atrial flutter seen on EKG. Patient has known atrial
flutter but did not tolerate coumadin [**2-12**] bleeding. Normal TSH.
