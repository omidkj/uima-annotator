Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Iodine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, CVA tenderness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77 yo man with h/o Parkinson's, sickle trait,
diet controlled DM, hyperlipidemia, who presents from [**Hospital 7137**] with a two day history of fever, tachycardia, and
hypotension. Of note, the patient has been admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
twice since [**2144-5-1**]. On the first admission, he was found to
have a CK elevated to the 4000s, pancytopenia, and fevers to
102. This was thought to be secondary to a viral infection, and
he was discharged to a rehab facility. Three days later, the
patient was admitted with a Hct drop from 28 to 23. His stools
were guaiac negative, and since he is a Jehovah's witness, the
patient did not receive a blood transfusion. His Hct remained
stable throughout the hospitalization, and he was again
discharged back to [**Hospital3 2558**].
.
For the past two days, the patient has again spiked fevers to
102 and has been tachycardic to the 130s-150s. He has a large
ecchymoses and two regions of soft tissue swelling on his left
upper extremity. He notes abdominal distension and states that
he has been having left lower back pain that has worsened over
the past two days. Given the patient's pancytopenia and recent
fevers, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further workup and
evaluation.
.
In the ED, the patient's VS were T 100.7, BP 100/64, P 108, R
18, O2 95% on RA. He was given 500 cc NS and Tylenol, and his VS
on transfer were T 103, P 78, BP 133/78, R 20, O2 96% on RA. He
had a CXR, which did not show any evidence of PNA, and a LUE
U/S, which did not show any evidence of DVT or abscess in the
extremity. He was started empirically on Vanc/Zosyn, and his U/A
in the ED was borderline for UTI. By the time of transfer, his
VS were T 103, 78, 133/78, 20, 96% on RA
.
On ROS, the patient denies dysphagia, chest pain, shortness of
breath, diarrhea, constipation, lower extremity edema, rashes,
and confusion. He endorses a headache, which began two weeks
ago.

LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND DATED [**2144-5-12**].
FINDINGS: Duplex ultrasound examination of the left upper
extremity was
performed. The left internal jugular vein, subclavian vein,
axillary vein,
brachial vein, and forearm veins demonstrate normal color
Doppler flow and
response to compression and augmentation without evidence of
deep venous
thrombosis. Evaluation of the indurated area within the left
upper extremity demonstrates soft tissue edema with no focal
fluid collection identified.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis or abscess within the left
upper
extremity.

[**5-12**] RENAL U/S
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis or obstructing calculi.
2. 9-mm exophytic echogenic focus off the upper pole of the
right kidney
which is not seen on prior CT or ultrasound and may represent a
small AML. A repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis on a non
emergent basis may be obtained to further evaluate this finding.


[**5-13**] LIVER U/S
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased hepatic echogenicity, with scattered hypoechoic
regions seen,
which are somewhat ill-defined and not clearly present on prior
examinations. While the findings may represent fatty liver with
regions of focal sparing, the appearance is not classic and
further evaluation with dedicated hepatic MRI is recommended.
2. Gallbladder sludge.
3. Splenomegaly.
4. Trace free fluid.

[**5-15**] CT C/A/P
IMPRESSION:
1. Ascites and pleural effusions, likely related to
third-spacing of fluid. This may also explain the appearance of
the gallbladder wall. Nevertheless, cholecystitis is not
excluded here and concern should be weighed agains laboratory
and clinical findings. A HIDA scan may clarify this possibility.

2. Bibasilar atelectasis with hazy right lower lobe opacity
which is
equivocal and may represent infection.
3. Cirrhotic liver with periportal prominent lymph nodes, which,
together
with a rising [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest hepatitis. Hepatic
hypodensities
likely represent fatty infiltration.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 77 year old man with history of Parkinson's, sickle
trait, diet controlled DM, presented on [**2144-5-12**] from [**Hospital 7137**] with 2 day history of fever, tachycardia and hypotension,
with subsequent complicated hospital course including
fevers/pancytopenia, bone marrow biopsy consistent with
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, transient ICU stay.
.
# Pancytopenia/New Diagnosis of Hemophagocytic Syndrome: Patient
presented with pancytopenia, and hematology/oncology were
consulted.  A bone marrow biopsy was performed that demonstrated
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.  There was initial concern
for tumor lysis and the patient was started on continuous IVFs
and allopurinol.  He also was found to be in chronic DIC an
