History of Present Illness:
-- per admitting resident --
Pt is a 82 yo female with multiple medical problems incl CHF,
COPD (FEV1/FVC ratio of 49%), h/o PE  and a recent
hospitalization for MRSA/E coli pneumonia 1 month ago s/p tx
with Vanc/CTX, now admitted for fever (temp up to 100.3),
worsening SOB for 5 days. Pt admits to a chronic cough, but
states it hasn't been any worse recently.  States it is
occasionally productive, with whitish sputum.  Denies
hemoptysis.  Of note, pt has had multiple admissions for COPD
flare/pneumonias in the past, incl once in the ICU and
intubated.  Pt is not on home oxygen.  Denies URI symptoms
recently such as congestion, sore throat. Denies sick contacts.
Denies smoking or anyone around her smoking.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS T 99 HR 52 BP 100/58 RR 18 O2 sat
99%2L nc. Pt was given Solumedrol 125 as well as abx incl CTX,
Azithro and Levoquin.  Pt was also given frequent nebs. EKG was
without changes. CXR showed bibasilar opacities that could
represent pneumonia. Pt's BP transiently dropped to systolics in
80s, thus was given 500 cc bolus and SBPs recovered to 95-105.

Upon transfer to the floor, pt doing well, states her breathing
is good.  Denies cough currently.  Denies chest pain.

CT CHEST [**7-12**]:
1)Multifocal consolidation which has improved in the left lower
lobe and is slightly worse in the right lower and upper lobes
since recent conventional CXRs.
2)Moderately severe diffuse centrilobular emphysema
3)Diffuse atherosclerotic calcification in the coronary
arteries, aorta, in the mitral annulus and aortic valve.
4)New intraabdominal ascites and new small right pleural
effusion.

CXR [**7-14**]:
Single portable chest radiograph is compared to the prior study
from
[**2142-7-12**]. A right IJ catheter terminates in superior vena cava.
There is a small left-sided pleural effusion with left lower
lobe atelectasis. There is mild atelectasis at the right lung
base. Heart and mediastinum are probably within normal limits.
Upper lung zones are clear. Very little change from the prior
study.

CTA CHEST [**7-16**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Stable bilateral lower lobe consolidation.
3. Increasing right greater than left bilateral pleural
effusions.
4. Moderate ascites.

KUB [**7-18**]:
No evidence of obstruction. Mild colonic wall thickening
particularly in the right hemicolon is noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Pneumonia - On admission, pneumonia was felt less likely given
lack of clear evidence on chest x-ray and low grade temperature.
 Treated for COPD exacerbation with Levaquin and high dose pulse
steroids with plan for quick taper.  Shortness of breath
remained at baseline for 48 hours after admission.  On hospitaly
day 2, repeat chest x-ray obtained in setting of hypotension
showed worsening RLL opacity and Vancomycin and Cefepime were
started due to history of MRSA and Pseudomonnal pneumonia.  On
hospital day 3, patient complained of increased dyspnea, was not
hypoxic.  She was also persistently hypotensive unresponsive to
fluids and was transferred to the ICU for further management.
In the ICU a central line was placed and CVP monitoring revealed
low values indicative of hypovolemia.  She was resuscitated with
IV fluids and her blood pressure was initially responsive.  She
was continued on IV Vancomycin, IV Cefepime and IV Levofloxacin
for double coverage given her recent hospitalization and history
of Pseudomonal pneumonia, and she completed an eight day course
of these antibiotics.  Her respiratory status improved slowly
with decreased work of breathing.  She required only minimal
oxygen supplemenation intermittently.

# Sepsis - Likely secondary to pneumonia and C. diff diagnosed
on hospital day 1.  Initially normotensive on admission, Mrs.
[**Known lastname 9483**] was hypotensive to SBP 80's on hospital day 2 with
adequate response to 2L fluid bolus.  Anti-hypertensives held.
On hospital day 3, patient became hypotensive to 70-80's with
little improvement after 3.5L bolus.  Due to persistant
hypotension, transferred to ICU and continued Vancomycin and
Cefepime for pneumonia as well as PO Vancomycin for C. Diff.  In
the ICU a central line was placed and CVP monitoring revealed
low values indicative of hypovolemia.  She was resuscitated with
IV fluids and her blood pressure was initially responsive.
Presumedly she was hypovolemic due to massive GI losses from
C.diff.  She was continued on IV boluses PRN.  Although he blood
pressure did not improve greatly and she remained modestly
hypotensive with SBP 90s, on [**7-15**] gentle diuresis was started
given her history of diastolic CHF as well as anasarca from
worsened hypoalbuminemia.  She tolerated this well without
worsening of her blood pressures.  After completing an eight day
course of antibiotics for pneumonia, the plan is to complete an
additional 6 week taper of PO vancomycin for recurrent C. di
