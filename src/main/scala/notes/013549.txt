Pertinent Results:
Echo [**6-5**]: Pre-CPB: The left atrium is elongated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed. There is mild global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The prosthetic mitral valve
leaflets are thickened. The gradients are higher than expected
for this type of prosthesis. There is severe mitral stenosis.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Mitral annulus
measures 3.8 cm. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. Tricuspid annulus diameter is 3.7 cm. Post-CPB: A
well-seated and functioning Mitral prosthesis is seen. Gradient
= 5. Area = 2.8. A well-seated and functioning tricuspid ring is
seen, with no residual TR. Good biventricular systolic function
(patient is on low dose Epi+ NTG).
CXR [**6-7**]: Small left-sided pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with increasing
DOE s/p MV repair in [**2133**] followed by tissue MVR in [**2138**].
Following her pre-operative work-up and surgical consent, she
was directly admitted and brought to the operating room where
she underwent a Mitral Valve Replacement and Tricuspid Valve
Repair. Please see operative report for surgical details. She
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Immediately
post-operatively she required multiple transfusions (PRBCs,
platelets, FFP) for bleeding, low HCT and decreased svo2. She
also required several more blood transfusions during
post-operative course. The last being on [**6-8**], where she
received 2 units or PRBCs for a HCT of 21.9. HCT at time of
discharge was 28.1. On post-operative day 1 she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. She was
weaned off all pressors by post-op day two and started on
beta-blockers and diuretics. She was gently diuresed towards her
pre-op weight. Chest tubes were removed on post-op day two. She
was transferred to the cardiac surgery step-down unit on post-op
day three. Epicardial pacing wires removed on post-op day four.
Physical therapy followed patient during entire post-op course
for strength and mobility. On post-op day five she appeared to
be doing well. Her labs and vital signs were stable and
captopril was added. She was discharged to home with VNA
services and the appropriate follow-up appointments.
