ADMISSION TO THE MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT ON [**2175-2-8**].

ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hypotension.
2.  Anemia.
3.  Clotted AV fistula.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient, when he arrived to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit, was an 83 year old male with
a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an
ejection fraction of 20%, and end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis.  He presented to the Emergency Room with a
clotted AV fistula and a ten point hematocrit drop from 32 to
22 and guaiac positive stools.

The patient was on hemodialysis where the upper portion of
his AV fistula was noted to be occluded and the patient was
unable to be dialyzed.  According to the transfer note, while
at rehabilitation, the patient's hematocrit was noted to
gradually drop.  On [**2175-1-27**], it was 36.3; on [**2-6**] it was
25.0.  The patient was also noted to be guaiac positive with
one out of two stool samples at rehabilitation and was noted
to suffer from failure to thrive from upper chest pain, with
swallowing both liquids and solids.

On arrival to the Emergency Department, the patient's
systolic blood pressures were in the 90s with a temperature
of 100.8 F., and O2 saturations were 100% on two liters.  The
patient's blood pressure then fell to 70/30 and the patient
was given a fluid bolus with blood pressures increasing to
86/36.  The patient was transfused one unit of packed red
blood cells in the Emergency Department and with the recent
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia on
[**2175-1-28**], the patient was given Vancomycin one gram
intravenously times one.

The patient was noted to be persistently hypotensive with
blood pressures falling systolic to the 70s and not
responding to gentle intravenous fluid boluses given
congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of greater
than 25 to 30%.  The patient was started on Dopamine through
his peripheral intravenous with transient increasing systolic
blood pressures to the 80s until a right internal jugular
line was placed.  The patient was then switched to Levophed
as a preferred choice and was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  From the Medical Intensive Care Unit
resident note:  Temperature of 100.8 F.; blood pressure
100/40; heart rate of 85; respiratory rate of 18; O2
saturation of 98% on two liters.  In general, the patient is
an elderly male lying in bed, ill appearing, in no apparent
distress.  HEENT:   Extraocular motions
intact.  Pupils equally round and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Sclerae anicteric.  Oropharynx clear.
Cardiovascular with regular rate; plus II/VI systolic
ejection murmur.  Chest with decreased breath sounds at
bilateral bases; otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities with left arm AV fistula palpable with
thrill.  Bilateral below the knee amputation without
swelling, warm and well perfused.  Neurologic is awake and
oriented to person and place.  Strength is four out of five
bilaterally upper and lower extremities.

LABORATORY:  Pertinent labs on admission showed lactate noted
to be 2.4, hematocrit was 22.1.  White blood cell count 10.6,
potassium 6.2, creatinine 9.0.

EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 74 beats per minute with
LAD and T wave inversions in V2 through V3.

Chest x-ray showed collapse consolidation of both lung bases
with moderate right pleural effusion which is partially
loculated.  Probable left pleural effusion with stable
appearance from [**2175-1-25**].

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  ISCHEMIC LEFT HAND FISTULA CLOT:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
Transplant Surgeon, was following during this admission.  The
patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2-10**] as his left
hand was noted to be ischemic with dark blue fingers.  The
patient's fistula was removed and hand was re-vascularized.
A Port-A-Cath was placed on the left side for hemodialysis
usage at that time.

The patient had a biphasic signal after his repair with no
palpable pulses, however, the patient's hand turned pink in
color with increasing warmth.

2.  ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA:  The patient continued to be
hypoxic during this admission and remained on approximately
four liters of nasal cannula.  The patient's swallow study to
evaluate risk for aspiration showed that the patient will
chronically aspirate for life unless a PEG tube is placed.
The patient denied wanting an NG tube or a PEG tube during
this admission.  In the past hospitalizations, the patient
has also refused other modes of feeding.  Noting that the
patient will be chronically aspirating, the patient is
expected to be on oxygen the remainder of his life.

The patient will be treated during this admission for 14 days
of Levofloxacin and Flagyl.

3.  HYPOTENSION:  Most likely etiology of hypotension was the
septic physiology from his aspiration pneumonia.  Other
possible etiologies would be his new beta blocker.  The
patient was given Dopamine and Levophed for a short period of
time.  The patient's blood pressure then remained stable off
of pressors for several days.

A beta blocker was started and the patient again became
hypotensive, responding to intravenous fluid.  The patient's
blood pressure again rose to systolic around 100 with good
mentation.  Again, the patient's possible sources included
aspiration pneumonia and his sacral decubitus ulcer.  The
patient was treated with Levofloxacin and Flagyl for a 14 day
course.

4.  SACRAL DECUBITUS ULCER STAGE III:  The patient had
debridement done on [**2-13**] with Plastics following
during this admission.  A multivitamin was added to his
regimen.

5.  ANEMIA:  The patient with guaiac positive stools and was
transfused one unit during this hospitalization.
Gastrointestinal was consulted and recommended work-up as an
outpatient when the patient was more stable from a cardiac
standpoint and view.

6.  NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  The patient had
a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit hospitalization course.  The etiology of
this was unclear but it occurred secondary to his anemia.
His EKG was showing only a picture of demand and MB index of
35%.  The patient was not able to tolerate a beta blocker or
ACE inhibitor with his low systolic blood pressures, however,
was maintained on an aspirin and statin.

7.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  An echocardiogram on [**2-9**] had
increased tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary
hypertension with apical anterior akinesis and an ejection
fraction of 25% which has not changed.  The patient meets the
criteria for anti-coagulation however, due to fall risk, the
patient will not be started on any anti-coagulation.  The
patient also has dilated right atrium and had an episode of
atrial fibrillation controlled with Diltiazem in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit on [**2-11**].  However, the patient again
will be held off anti-coagulation; this was discussed with
out attending.

8.  END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE:  The patient is on hemodialysis
every Monday, Wednesday and Frid
