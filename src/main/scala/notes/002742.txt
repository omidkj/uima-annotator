.
Radiologic Data:
[**2166-3-27**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema and
moderate bilateral effusions and atelectasis.
.
[**2166-3-28**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2158-11-8**], the left
ventricular ejection fraction is reduced.
.
IMPRESSION: moderately reduced left ventricular contractile
function; heavy calcification of mitral annulus and support
structures

MICRO:
[**3-27**] BCx: P x 2
[**3-29**] UCx: P

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 86F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
hypothyroidism presenting with cough and fatigue, found to be in
pAF with new systolic heart failure.
.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Patient was admitted with AF in
rate of 130s in ED, but had spontaneous conversion to NSR. This
was the first documented episode of afib for this patient.
Infectious w/u negative. TSH was WNL. There was no e/o acute MI,
with negative cardiac enzymes x 2 and no acute ST-T changes
consistent with ischemia on EKG.  She remained in NSR during
much of her hospital course; however, she did have several
recurrent episodes of AF requiring IV medications for rate
control. On [**3-30**], the patient was transferred to the CCU for
altered mental status and AF with RVR to 140s despite IV BB and
CCB.  She was started on an amiodarone load with amiodarone 400
[**Hospital1 **].  She should be continued on amiodarone 400 [**Hospital1 **] for a 7 day
course ([**Date range (1) 13500**]), followed by 200 [**Hospital1 **] x 7 days, then 200 daily
for maintenance dose.  She was also started on a BB which she
tolerated well.  Her CHADS2 score was 3; however, after
discussion of risks and benefits with the patient and her family
they declined anticoagulation given her high fall risk. She was
continued on ASA 325mg. She was scheduled a follow up
appointment with Cardiology clinic prior to discharge.
.
CHF:  She was noted to have a new global hypokinesis with EF
30-40% on this admission.  As above, there was no e/o acute MI
on admission given negative cardiac enzymes and no acute ST-T
changes consistent with ischemia on EKG.  Echo showed no WMA.
She was diursed to euvolemia during this hospitalization.  She
should have a repeat ECHO in [**1-27**] months to reassess with her
LVEF.
.
Chronic renal failure: Likely due to long-standing HTN.  Renal
function stable.
.
Hypertension: Continued on BB and ACEI.
.
Hyperlipidemia: Continued on home dose of simvastatin.
