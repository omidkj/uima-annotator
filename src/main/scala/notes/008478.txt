Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- EGD
- TIPS Angioplasty and Embolization of Varices


History of Present Illness:
46 yo F w/ ETOH/HCV cirrhosis, grade 1 varices and portal
gastropathy who presented to the ED yesterday with 1 episode of
hematemesis on [**7-30**], which the patient describes as "dark
clots...just old blood". She subsequently left AMA and returned
the next day with melena x 1. Of note, pt was recently admitted
in [**5-14**] with hematemesis and melena and admitted to the MICU due
to hypotension to SBP 70s. At that time she was treated with NG
lavage, FFP, vitamin K, Levofloxacin 500, Octreotide, PPI and
fluid resucitation along large volume blood transfusions (9
units). Her course was complicated by hypoxia and fluid
overload. She is s/p TIPS in [**6-18**] and since that time has been
doing relatively well. The patient denies the use of NSAIDs,
anti-coagulants, iron supplementation or pepto bismol.

Past Medical History:

symptoms according to patient
-Chronic LE neuropathy
-Diastolic CHF

Pertinent Results:

INR 1.9

RECENT IMAGING:
EKG [**7-31**]:
SR at 93 bpm, nl axis, QTc slightly prolonged at 450 ms, TWI
V1-3

[**7-30**] U/S:
Patent TIPS stent with no significant change in velocities of
flow compared to [**2176-6-8**].

EGD [**6-18**]:
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus
Erythema and congestion in the stomach body and fundus
compatible with moderate portal gastropathy
Varices at the second part of the duodenum
No gastric varices

[**2176-6-18**]
TIPS
1. Successful placement of a transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt using three 10-mm bare metallic Wallstents
extending from a right portal vein to the right hepatic vein.
2. Slightly unusual hepatic venous anatomy identified with two
separate right hepatic veins which were small in caliber.
3. Gradient between the portal vein and IVC pre-TIPS placement
was 13 mmHg. Post- TIPS placement the gradient was 9 mmHg.
[**6-4**] EGD:
Grade I varices at the lower third of the esophagus
Grade 1 esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction
Portal gastropathy
Duodenitis in the proximal bulb
Large duodenal varix


Brief Hospital Course:
Blood loss anemia/GI bleeding:

Pt was transferred from floor to MICU after an episode of
hematemesis and melena.  After transfer to MICU, patient was
followed closely by transplant hepatology.  Pt was s/p TIPS
placement by IR on [**2176-6-18**] - pt now returns with duodenal
bleeding and had an EGD with cauterization.  Hepatic venogram
performed on [**2176-8-1**] revealed a probable umbilical varix, which
was embolized with multiple coils. Pressure gradients across the
TIPS were about 10 mmHg before and after angioplasty of proximal
portion.

Pt's blood count remained stable and patient was discharged to
home from the MICU.
