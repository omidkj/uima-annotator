History of Present Illness:
81 year old man with DM2, Parkinson's Disease, CAD with recent
medically managed NSTEMI [**3-9**] but also s/p multiple PCAs most
recent w/ POBA to mid-RCA [**1-4**], and RCC s/p nephrectomy
presented to ED with altered mental status on [**2186-4-9**]. Per his
wife who is his main care-giver and [**Name Initial (MD) **] retired RN, he has not
been himself for the last 4 days. Four days ago he started to
drop things, including his coffee mug. He was lethargic, and
slightly bradycardic at home to the 40s. He denies fever,
diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, dysuria, or frequency. The
only other positive on review of systems is that he had one
episode on the night before admission of waking up breathing
very fast. He did not complain of chest pain at the time and it
quickly resolved.
.
Of note, he has had a similar episodes of delirium every time he
is sick and was hospitalized from [**Date range (3) 22139**] at [**Hospital1 18**]
during which he was treated for a MRSA UTI with a 10 day course
of vancomycin. After this he also had a VRE UTI. He also had an
NSTEMI that was felt to be demand ischemia from hypotesion
related to sepsis from his urinary tract infection. Moreover, he
has had hypercarbic respiratory failure from CHF with PCO2 in
the 60s and very non-responsive. He was put on bipap in the unit
and did get better at that time.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 95.5 54 137/64 16 100% 2L . He
was AAOx3, somnolent, his heart rate was 22. Labs and imaging
significant for Trop 0.29, Na 149, K 4.2, Creatinine 1.3
(baseline 1.0-1.2), positive U/A. EKG showed SB, LAD, QRS
prolonged at 136 (previous EKG with QRS 144), no ischemic
changes. CT head was negative for acute process. Patient given
Calcium Gluconate 1g IV, Atropine Sulfate 1mg IV x1, Insulin
Regular 10 units IV x1 with Dextrose 50% 50mL due to concern for
hyperkalemia on EKG for prolonged QRS although K returned wnl.
He was also given Aspirin 600mg PR, Ceftriaxone 1g IV x1, and
Carbidopa-Levodopa CR 50-200 mg PO x1. Vitals on transfer were
98.5 46 108/56 18 96% on 2L.
.
On the floor, patient was sleepy was but arousable. He was not
able to answer any questions. Cardiac biomarkers were trended
with a peak to 0.36, which was felt to be secondary to demand in
the setting of possible urosepsis, with urine growing Ecoli. He
was initally treated with vancomyin and zosyn, which were later
switched to ciprofloxacin. Patient was ordered for aspirin,
plavix and statin, but due to his mental status he was not able
to take these medications. Given goals of care and DNR status,
no further intervention was pursued. Delirium was felt to be due
to infection, and workup included negative head imaging and a
normal TSH. Patient had an oxygen requirement of [**1-29**] L, which
was felt to be due to sepsis and aspiration. SBP was never below
98 on the floor and HR remained in the 40s to 70s. Yesterday an
ABG showed a pO2 of 52, but peripheral sats in the 90s. Patient
was started on a NRB, and became more lethargic, with a rise in
CO2 on ABG to 52, and an improvement in O2 to 211. Mental status
gradually cleared with no intervention, and patient was
downtitrated to 2L oxygen.
.
This morning, the patient became suddenly bradycardic to 35,
hypotensive with SBP of 66, and hypoxic to 76 on a NRB with 10L.
Urgent MICU consult was requested. Peripheral dopamine was
started and SBP improved to 70s. After agressive suctioning,
oxygen saturation improved to 90. He was transferred to the ICU
for further care. After transfer, dopamine was stopped and
patient was downtitrated to 6 L oxygen via NC. An ABG during the
event showed 7.13/81/71 on NRB, and improved marginally to
7.18/71/71 on 6L after deep suctioning.
