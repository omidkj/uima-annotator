Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intra-aortic balloon pump placement
2. Cardiac catheterization with left main coronary artery bare
metal stent placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with history of prior CVA,
hypertension, cirrhosis and prior NSTEMI which was treated
medically in [**2136-10-24**] who presents now as a transfer from OSH with a new NSTEMI.
He has been complaining of epigastric pain and "heart burn" for
5 days leading up to this admission. He had associated chest
pain radiating to his jaw and bilateral arms for several days,
almost continuously but waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] in intensity. He
states that he felt better with burping, and his pain worsened
after eating food. He denies any shortness of breath, chills, or
sweats. The patient presented to OSH and was found to have
elevated Troponins to 2.0 with CK of 103. CXR showing mild
pulmonary edema. The patient was treated as an NSTEMI protocol
with heparin, [**Doctor Last Name **], [**Doctor Last Name 4532**] load and he was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Aditional review of his EKG at
[**Hospital1 18**] revealed normal sinus rhythm but prominent ST segment
depressions in I, II, aVL, V5-V6
and ST segment elevations in leads aVR and V1. After admission,
the patient was observed on telemetry in preparation for a
cardiac catheterization. He was given ongoing therapy with
[**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Statin, beta-blocker, and IV heparin. Overnight, he
triggered for hypotension and was given fluid bolus of 500cc x2.
He remained chest pain free initially but had recurrent chest
pain in the early morning hours requiring IV morphine.

In the cardiac cath lab, a right heart catheterization
demonstrated RA Pressure of 19 mmHg,RVEDP 21 mm Hg, PASP 51 with
a mean of 39 mm Hg and PCWP 34 mm Hg. Fluids were discontinued
and Mr. [**Known lastname **] was given 40mg IV lasix. On left heart
catheterization, the LMCA had a distal 90% stenosis at the
trifurcation of the ramus intermedius, LAD, and LCX. The LAD had
mild diffuse disease with a large D1. The LCX had an OM1 with
diffuse 90% proximal stenosis. The RCA was totally occluded
proximally with faint left-right collaterals. Resting
hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left-sided filling
pressures consistent with cardiogenic shock. The cardiac output
was 4.2 l/min with an index of 2.0 l/min/m2 and left
ventriculography was deferred with plan to stabilize patient
with IABP and consider stent or  CABG at later time. Ultimately,
the patient underwent stent placement on [**2136-11-2**] with stent
placed across LAD to distal left main coronary artery. Outcome
showed an improvement to 30% obstruction at trifurcation vs.
prior 90% blockage, with a  TIMI 3 result.
.
On arrival to CCU, patient was chest pain free and had no
shortness of breath. He was lying flat in bed on 4L NC. He
denied any back, groin pain, LE pain.  On review of systems, he
denied any prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denied
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

Pertinent Results:
[**2136-11-1**] Admission EKG: sinus rhythm with nml axis, nml
intervals, ST depressions in V4-V6, I, AVL and ST elevation in
AVR. Borderline ST elevation in V1.

[**2136-11-2**] Cardiac Cath Report: 1. Successful PTCA and placement
of a 3.0x15mm Vision stent in the distal LMCA and origin LAD
were performed.  The stent was postdilated proximally using a
4.5x8mm Quantum Maverick balloon and distally using a 3.5x12mm
Quantum Maverick balloon.  Final angiography showed normal flow,
no apparent dissection, and a 30% residual stenosis at the
trifurcation site.  (See PTCA comments.)
2. Left femoral arteriotomy closure was performed using an 8
French
Angioseal VIP. FINAL DIAGNOSIS:PTCA and placement of a
bare-metal stent in the distal LMCA to origin LAD.
.
[**2136-11-3**] ECHO :
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There
is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
pressure. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
