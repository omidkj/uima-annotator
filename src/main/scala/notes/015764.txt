History of Present Illness:
This 77 year-old patient who has had previous bypass grafts in
[**2143**] with vein grafts to diagonal,obtuse marginal and posterior
descending artery and left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery
presented with increasing symptoms of dyspnea on exertion. He
was investigated and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
with preserved left ventricular function and patent coronary
grafts. His aortic valve was severely calcified with very
significant calcification in the region of the sinotubular
junction. He is also on Coumadin for preoperative atrial
fibrillation. He was electively admitted
for aortic valve replacement.

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT [**2-16**]: 1. Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications
involving all portions of the thoracic aorta, but with greater
involvement of the descending aorta and arch than the ascending
aorta. 2. Congestive failure with interstitial edema and small
right pleural effusion.

Echo [**2-17**]: No change in LV function LV EF 50-55%. RV with mild
to moderate hypokinesis, improved from intial moderate
hypokinesis immediately post bypass. MR remains high mild to
moderate range, TR remains mild to moderate. Mechanical #23
Aortic valve prosthesis in situ. No AI, No perivalvular leaks.
Peak gradient 10 mm Hg, Mean gradient 5 mm Hg, but views for cw

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, patient was electively admitted
pre-operatively secondary to his h/o Atrial Fibrillation and
being on Coumadin. Coumadin was discontinued and he was started
on Heparin. His INR was followed and awaited it to come down to
under 1.3 prior to surgery. Also prior to surgery he underwent a
chest CT to evaluate his calcified aortic valve/aorta (please
see pertinent results). He received Vit K and was eventually
brought to the operating room on [**2-17**]. He underwent a
Redo-Sternotomy, Aortic Valve Replacement with a Mechanical
Valve. Please see operative note for surgical details. He was
transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on Epi, Levo, and
Neo. Patient remained intubated until post-operative day two
when Propofol was weaned and patient awoke neurologically
intact. Warfarin therapy was resumed. Mechanical ventilation was
then weaned and he was extubated. Chest tubes were removed
post-op day two.  Patient also remained on multiple
Inotropes/Pressors through post-operative day three. Patient
continued to have improving hemodynamics and drips were slowly
weaned. Foley catheter and Swan were removed on post-op day
three and he was transferred to the cardiac step-down unit. He
was started on Heparin for a subtherapeutic prothrombin time. He
required several large doses of Warfarin before becoming
therapeutic. Given his history of atrial fibrillation and
mechanical valve, Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR between 2.0
- 3.0. Heparin was eventually discontinued on postoperative day
*****. He underwent a speech and swallow evaluation on
postoperative day four for a questionable episode of aspiration.
He experienced coughing and difficulty breathing. Evaluation
revealed no signs of aspiration but based on his history, there
was concern for laryngospasm of his vocal cords secondary to
regurgitation. He had no diet restrictions and tolerated a
regular diet for the rest of his hospital stay without further
difficulty. Over several days, he clinically improved with
diuresis and continued to make steady progress with physical
therapy. His INR slowly progressed towards a therapeutic range.
Medical therapy was optimized and he was cleared for discharge
on postoperative day ten. At discharge, his BP was  124/80 with
a HR of 84 atrial fibrillation. All surgical wounds were clean,
dry and intact. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], his
cardiologist and his primary care physician as an outpatient.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26033**] will manage his coumadin dosing for a target INR of
2.5-3.5. His first blood draw PT/INR will be [**2158-2-28**] at 10:30AM.
His INR on discharge was 2.6 and he was discharged with 5mg
tablets.
