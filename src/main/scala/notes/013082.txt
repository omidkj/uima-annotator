Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
severe headache; difficulty ambulating


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt with stage 1 root canal performed on Friday [**2118-3-4**].
Complains of not feeling well over the weekend, but was able to
work two 12 hour shifts as a nurse over the weekend.  Tuesday
noc she was awakened from sleep with a severe headache ("felt
like a rubber band around my head").  On [**2118-3-11**] (following
friday) the patient had stage 2 of her root canal performed.
She states that she continued to feel worse afterwards with
continued headaches and "difficulty negotiating" around her
house.  Pt has bruise to left hip from bumping into doorway and
c/o stubbing her toe multiple times lately.  Due to these
symptoms pt went to see her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1262**].  Her BP at that time
was 190's/100's.  She was
started on lisinopril and scheduled for a carotid duplex today.
Pt was accompanied by her friend to appointment and was "unable
to get out of car" at that time, also had some transient right
arm numbness/tingling.  Pt to emergency room  for further eval.
To [**Hospital **] Hospital where CXR showed mass.  Head CT was
performed which showed mult lesions including cerebellar lesion
with edema as well as basilar tip aneurysm.  Transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further eval.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST [**2118-3-15**]

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
R/O Multiple metastises
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: No axillary,
mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy is seen. Emphysematous
changes are seen predominantly at the lung apices.

A large mass is seen in the left upper lobe measuring 5.4 cm in
maximal diameter. No other lung masses or nodules are seen.
There are mild atelectatic changes at the left lung base. No
pleural effusions are seen. The heart is normal in size, there
is no pericardial effusion. The aorta and great vessels appear
unremarkable except atherosclerotic calcifications.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: There is a
subcentimeter hypoattenuating lesion in the left lobe of the
liver, which most likely represents a cyst but malignancy cannot
be excluded, and MRI would be recommended if further evaluation
is indicated. The liver is otherwise unremarkable. Liver,
gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, and left kidney are within
normal limits. The right kidney contains two hypoenhancing
lesions that are too small to characterize, but most likely
represent renal cysts. Metastatic lesions, however, cannot be
excluded; an ultrasound opr MRI may be helpful for clarification
if indicated. The pancreas, stomach, and opacified loops of
large and small bowel appear unremarkable. No mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is seen. The abdominal aorta and
its tributaries appear patent. There are atherosclerotic
calcifications of the abdominal aorta and iliac vessels. No
ascites or free air is seen.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is sigmoid
diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. Bladder,
uterus, and rectum appear within normal limits. No free fluid is
seen within the pelvis. No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is
detected.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large lung mass in the left upper lobe consistent with lung
cancer.
2. Subcentimeter hypoattenuating lesion in the left lobe of the
liver too small to accurately characterize. This most likely
represents a cyst; however, if clinically indicated, an MRI for
further assessment would be helpful.
3. Two subcentimeter hypoattenuating lesions in the right
kidney, most likely representing cysts. Ultrasounds or MRI would
be recommended if further assessment is indicated.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
5. Emphysematous changes predominantly at the lung apices.
MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2118-3-16**] 3:34 PM

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST

Reason: R/O abcess vs met and assess anuerysm. MRI +/-gado plus
mra
Contrast: MAGNEVIST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old woman with large cystic lesions on head CT, large
lung tumor recent hx of root canal. R/O abcess vs metatsis; Also
has basilar tip aneurysm
Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were
obtained without and with intravenous gadolinium administration.
Correlation is made to a CT examination dated [**2118-3-15**].

There are several large cystic lesions of increased T1 and T2
signal involving the left cerebellar hemisphere, the right
parietal lobe posteriorly, and the right frontal lobes. The
lesions demonstrate increased T1 signal probably related to the
presence of high content of protein. There is slight enhancement
seen peripherally following intravenous gadolinium
administration. The largest of these lesions is seen within the
right posterior occipitoparietal region and measures 5.2 x 3.6
cm. There is mild surrounding vasogenic edema. These are most
likely consistent with metastatic lesions probably related to
the patient's underlying lung mass. There is mass effect
involving the left pontomedullary junction due to the presence
of a large left cerebellar lesion and slight compression of the
fourth ventricle inferiorly. No hydrocephalus is seen. There is
slight midline shift to the left by 3 mm. Mild downward
displacement of the left cerebellar tonsil is seen probably
related to the large cerebellar lesion and there is partial
effacement of the left posterior quadrigeminal cistern. No
pathologic meningeal enhancement seen following intravenous
gadolinium administration. There are no acute territorial
infarcts noted on diffusion image.

IMPRESSION: Several large lesions of incr
