History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5320**] is a 72 y/o female with a history of HCV, metastatic
HCC that is not amenable to treatment, who initially presented
to the ER with altered mental status since last night. Her
daughters say that starting yesterday she was much more sleepy,
not wanting to get up, they also said that she had been coughing
and having nasal congestion. She was not eating or drinking
much, only a few small sips of water. This morning she was not
really waking up much, so they called 911. A BLS ambulance
arrived and her fingerstick was 27, they attempted to give her
oral glucose while awaiting an ACLS ambulance, after the oral
glucose her repeat blood sugar was 17. After the ACLS ambulance
arrived, she was given 1 amp of D50 and brought her into the
[**Hospital1 18**] ER.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97, 83/41, 22. She was given 2LNS,
but remained hypotensive so a right IJ was placed and she was
started on levophed. A bedside ultrasound was done that showed a
small amount of ascites, a paracentesis was attempted twice but
failed, a CXR was concerning for possible pneumonia so she was
given vancomycin, ceftriaxone and flagyl. Labs were notable for
a WBC of 2.1 with 25bands, lactate of 6.7, INR of 2.6, U/A with
19 white cells, Cr of 2.5 from a baseline of 1.0. VS on
transfer: 124/97 on 0.03 of levo, 77, 22, 95-100% on RA.
.
On arrival to the MICU, her initial VS: 98.8, 118, 124/64, 20,
94% on 3LNC. Using her daughters to translate, she denied any
pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting or
abdominal pain.

CT head:
 No acute intracranial process.  No large mass or significant
edema to suggest metastatic disease, but MRI is more sensitive.

CXR:
1.  Moderate pulmonary edema.
2.  Possible lung metastases for which further evaluation is
recommended with chest CT.

CT abd/pelvis:
1.  Multiple pulmonary nodules with ill-defined, incompletely
imaged,
consolidation in the right middle and left lower lung lobe as
also some
atelectasis in the right lower lung lobe.  Trace bilateral
pleural effusions.
2.  Cirrhotic liver with portal hypertension, numerous
ill-defined hypodense
liver masses consistent with the patient's multifocal HCC.  Mild
amount of
ascites.
3.  Diffuse anasarca.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5320**] is a 72 y/o female with metastatic HCC, who
presented to the hospital with altered mental status, found to
be hypoglycemic and hypotensive, found to have Klebsiella
bacteriemia thought to be from an abdominal source.

Patient was initially treated with IVF for resuscitation for
hypotension, lactic acidosis and low urine output. However given
lack of response to IVF she was additionally treated with
crystalloid and eventually requiring levophed for pressor
support.  She was empirically treated with ceftriaxone and
levofloxacin given lack of initial source of infection.  Lactic
acidosis and blood sugars were followed closely.  Concern for
lack of clearance given underlying hepatic dysfunction.  Patient
did require IV glucose to maintain sugars in the normal range.

Family meeting took place early in her hospitalization to
discuss status and poor prognosis.  Family decided to continue
single pressor with no further escalation of care. Over the
following days urine output continued to be poor, despite
maintaining adequate blood pressures.  Ultimately patient became
anuric on [**3-12**].

Palliative care was consulted to assist the family in end of
life discussion and for assistance with pain control as there
were qualms from patients family about the use of narcotic
medication for pain control.  Patient was given very low doses
of oxycodone in addition to tylenol for pain control.  As
patient clinically worsened, and respiratory status
decompensated as a result of volume overload, use of prn
morphine for comfort was addressed.  Family was in the process
of discussing goals and discontinuation of pressors.  However
prior to any intervention, patient was noted to become
bradycardic and go into PEA arrest.  No intervention was made
per goals of care.

Patient passed away peacefully with daughters at bedside.
Autopsy was declined.
