ct scan: . Large right hydropneumothorax with right lower lobe
atelectasis. A traumatic cystic lesion is seen within the right
lower lobe. There is a suggestion of possible bronchopulmonary
fistula.
2. Nasogastric tube with tip at the gastroesophageal junction,
and should be advanced.
3. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema within the chest wall.
4. Moderate sized left pleural effusion and compressive
atelectasis.
5. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver without evidence of
focal hepatic masses.
6. Wedge compression deformity of the T12 vertebral body, age
indeterminate.

echo: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is mild aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review)
of [**2138-11-10**], the degree of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary
hypertension
detected have increased.
