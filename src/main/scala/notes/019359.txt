History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12412**] is a 78 year-old woman with known coronary disease
who presents with worsening fatigue and exertional shortness of

Findings
A careful OG suction was done prior to the easy TEE insertion
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Focal calcifications in ascending
aorta. No atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. Focal calcifications in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Critical AS (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. No
MVP. Moderate mitral annular calcification. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.


TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:

The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.

The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results on Ms[**Known lastname 12412**] before surgicial incision..



Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2141-10-12**] Ms. [**Known lastname 12412**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a coronary artery bypass
grafting times four (LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and OM, SVG to
RCA) and aortic valve replacement (19mm [**Doctor Last Name 41833**] pericardial
valve), performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Please see the
operative note for details.  She tolerated this procedure well
and was tranferred in critical but stable condition to the
surgical intensive care unit.  She was extubated and weaned from
her pressors.  Her chest tubes were removed and pacing wires
were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.  She was transferred
to the step down floor.  She was aggressively diuresed and her
lopressor was uptitrated as tolerated.  She failed to void with
foley initally removed.  Her foley was reinserted, flomax was
started and she voided after foley was removed again.  Flomax
was discontined with a good void
