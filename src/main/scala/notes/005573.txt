Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2891**]
Chief Complaint:
Back pain; Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F w/ CAD (s/p PCI [**2165**]), CHF (EF 40%), HTN, DMII, CKD stage
IV, and h/o distant breast cancer who presented to the ED with
worsening lower back pain.
Patient states she has chronic back pain which has gotten
significantly worse the last 3 days, reported refractory to
tylenol but pt says she doesn't take pain meds much at home (at
most one tylenol a day). Patient denies fever, chills, numbness,
weakness. She denies urinary retention or bowel incontinence.
She states she otherwise feels well. She's been using icy hot
patches to control the back pain. She denies abdominal pain or
diarrhea, but reports some constipation. She initially thought
her back pain was due to this, but it didn't resolve when she
had a large BM this AM. She denies dysuria or difficulty
urinating.

In the ER, she also reported worsening shortness of breath that
began earlier today. Denied chest pain. Shortness of breath was
for approximately 2 hours earlier today. Now improved with nasal
cannula per ER report. On further questioning about this, she
says she is mildly short of breath at baseline going on walks or
rushing to bathroom at night. When pressed she says this has
actually worsened somewhat over last month and became acutely
worse today. However, this was not the reason she came to the
ER. She also reports a productive [**Year (4 digits) **] for roughly one month
with whitish sputum. She thought maybe she had bronchitis
because she gets bronchitis every year but hasn't had it yet
this year.

In the ED, initial VS: 99.6 74 162/88 26 99% 2L Nasal Cannula.
Trop was 0.02 (have been higher in past) and Cr 2.1. Due to SOB
D-dimer drawn and was elevated at 906. Lactate 1.2. CXR was
clear. CT torso showed -> question of early PNA with Right lower
lobe ground glass opacities so she was given CTX/Azithro after
blood cultures drawn. Given [**Year (4 digits) **]/Tylenol for back pain and or
ACS. Pt was admitted from the ER for V/Q scan due to concern for
PE in pt with elevated Cr. Back pain was considered
musculoskeletal in nature. VS on admission 98.7 ??????F (37.1 ??????C),
Pulse: 63, RR: 19, BP: 135/56, O2 sat 98% on 1L NC

Currently, pt feels much better than earlier today. She says the
main thing that has changed is that her back pain is better with
the meds she got in the ER (325mg [**Year (4 digits) **] and 325mg Tylenol).

[**2167-4-22**]:
ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Borderline prolongation of the P-R interval. Left
atrial
abnormality. Left axis deviation. Left bundle-branch block.

[**2167-4-22**]:
CXR:
1. Confluent right lung base opacity, increased in conspicuity
since
[**2167-3-6**] exam, which may represent atelectasis, assymetric
edema or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
2. Moderate cardiomegaly and perihilar vascular congestion,
unchanged.

[**2167-4-22**]:
CT torso w/o contrast:
1. Centrilobular ground-glass opacities, predominantly in basal
segments of
the right lower lobe, new since [**2164**] exam, suggestive of an
infectious or
inflammatory etiology. Punctate opacities in the left upper lobe
are also new since prior and may represent same underlying
infectious/inflammatory process.
2. Extensive calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and
its branches without associated aneurysmal changes. Assessment
for dissection is limited, given lack of intravenous contrast.
High-grade stenosis of the
intra-abdominal aorta is likely given calcification pattern,
which is largely unchanged since [**2166-12-31**] exam.
3. Small hiatal hernia.
4. Marked atrophy of the right kidney, unchanged. Left renal
cyst.
5. Scattered sigmoid colon diverticula. No associated
inflammatory changes.

[**2167-4-25**]:
CXR:
1. Centrilobular ground-glass opacities, predominantly in basal
segments of
the right lower lobe, new since [**2164**] exam, suggestive of an
infectious or
inflammatory etiology. Punctate opacities in the left upper lobe
are also new since prior and may represent same underlying
infectious/inflammatory process.
2. Extensive calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and
