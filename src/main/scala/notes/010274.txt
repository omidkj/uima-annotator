imaging
CXR
UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The patient is
status post left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker with leads
terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, in
unchanged positions.  There is moderate cardiomegaly which is
stable.  The aorta is tortuous.  The pulmonary vascularity is
normal without edema.  Calcified bilateral pleural plaques are
redemonstrated.  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Degenerative
changes of the right glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint
are noted, with narrowing of the right subacromial space
compatible with underlying rotator cuff disease.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Bilateral
calcified
pleural plaques.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 72 yo M history of CHF (EF 20%), DM, CAD s/p PTCA, and
protein S deficiency with multiple PE's s/p IVC filter on
Coumadin now admitted for fever, likely [**2-18**] cellulitis.
.
# Hypotension:  Patient found to be hypotensive with systolics
in the 80s-90s in the emergency department however not
tachycardic. Differential included sepsis in setting of active
infection vs cardiac etiology, given h/o CHF.  On review of
prior outpatient records, patient does appear to have lowish BPs
so this could be his baseline. Patient had no signs of bleed. On
arrival to the MICU, his were in normal range. He was continued
on the vanc/ceftaz started in the ED for cellulitis. His home
antihypertensives were held. Blood pressures fell into the 70s
for a period of time which improved without intervention into
the 80s-90s and then 100s overnight.  His baseline SBPs range in
the mid 90s. He remained asymptomatic and otherwise
hemodynamically stable. Metoprolol was restarted prior to
discharge.

# Fever/RLE cellulitis:  Patient was started on vancomycin and
ceftaz in the ED which were continued during his MICU stay. He
completed a 7 day course of antibiotics on the floor and his
erythema and warmth in the RLE resolved.

# Gout: continued Allopurinol

# Hypothyroidism: continued Levothyroxine

# HTN/CAD: continued Simvastatin, ASA. His metoprolol and
lisinopril were initially held in the setting of hypotension and
concern for possible sepsis.

# Chronic systolic CHF (EF 20%): The pt arrived to the hospital
significantly above his dry wt after going a significant period
of time as an out patient without diuretic meds. We initially
diuresed this pt with 40mg of IV lasix daily to which his UOP
responded appropriately. He was then transitioned to 20mg of PO
torsemide as an outpt and a follow up appointment was arranged
with the heart failure clinic. His creating was mildly elevated
from his baseline on discharge and we held his lisinopril until
his kidney function was rechecked at follow up appointments.

# DMII: HbA1C 8.0 on [**2140-5-21**]. He was continued on his home lantus
and insulin sliding scale while in house.

# h/o VT: continued home Amiodarone

# Insomnia: continued home Amitriptyline, Diazepam

# Protein S deficiency: On arrival to the ED his INR was sub
therapeutic. He was started on heparin gtt for anticoagulation
while his warfarin dose was up titrated. On discharge his INR
was 1.7. He was started on Enoxaparin [**Hospital1 **] until his INR reached
a therapeutic range. Pt was also instructed to continue to
overlap enoxaparin with warfarin for 24 hrs after reaching a
therapeutic INR.

#Transitional:
1. Lisinopril was held at discharge to be restarted once kidney
function is back to baseline
2. repeat INR should be followed up and LMWH should be
discontinued 24
