History of Present Illness:
50 yo male with history of HIV ([**2-26**] - CD4 908, VL < 50 copies)
and previous episode of PCP was admitted with 2-3 days of
fevers, myalgias, and malaise.
.
Patient reports that 2-3 days ago, he developed sudden onset of
increased fatigue, malaise, and muscle aches in his legs
bilaterally. Additional ROS was notable for the following:
- vomiting after trying to drink water
- decreased PO intake
- sick contacts including multiple co-workers sick with fatigue,
fevers, and cough
- loose stools - 2 loose, watery stools per day
- fevers and chills to 104 at home
- bitemporal headache pain which is now slightly improved
- reported abdominal pain in the ED but denies upon arrival to
the floor
.
He otherwise denies productive cough, facial pain, postnasal
drip, nasal congestion, sore throat, abdominal pain, dysuria,
hematuria, melena, or shortness of breath at home. Denies any
recent travel or antibiotic use. Did not receive the flu shot.
Patient has only tried tylenol at home for relief.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, temp 100.6, HR 118 (98-130), BP 144/78
(119-144/59-79), RR 36, and O2 sat 93% on 4L. While in the ED,
his temperature peaked to 101.3, O2 requirement increased to 97%
on 100% NRB. CXR was notable for a right lower lobe infiltrate.
RUQ US and Head CT were unremarkable. He received motrin 800mg x
1, zosyn 4.5g x 1, levofloxacin 750mg x 1, combivent, and
tylenol 1g x 1. He received 3-4L NS in the ED.

ADMISSION STUDIES:
- ECG [**2106-4-23**] - Sinus tachycardia
- Portable CXR - [**2106-4-23**] -  New right hilar opacity and vague
opacity in the left lung which likely represent pneumonia.
Dedicated PA and lateral films may be helpful Suggest followup
to resolution.
- RUQ US - [**2106-4-23**] - No evidence of cholelithiasis, gallbladder
wall thickening, or edema.
- CT Head w/o contrast - [**2106-4-23**] - No acute hemorrhage or mass
effect.

MRI [**5-17**]
FINDINGS: There is marked FLAIR hyperintensity within the
bilateral posterior parietal and occipital subcortical white
matter and milder FLAIR abnormality within the bilateral
cerebellar hemispheres, suggestive of posterior reversible
encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). No diffusion abnormality is seen
in these areas, also consistent with PRES. Tiny scattered
punctate areas of restricted diffusion are seen within the left
frontal and right parietal lobes, suggesting tiny embolic
infarcts. There is no evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect. The
ventricles are normal in size and configuration. Fluid is seen
in the mastoid air cells and nasopharynx, likely related to
prolonged intubation. On post-contrast images, there is a small
amount of enhancement within the right occipital cortex, also
likely related to PRES and breakdown of the blood -brain
barrier.
MRA OF THE HEAD AND NECK: The MRA is normal, with normal caliber
of the
carotid and vertebral arteries and their intracranial branches.
No evidence of stenosis or aneurysm.
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked edema within the posterior parietal, occipital, and
cerebellar
hemispheres without diffusion abnormality, suggestive of PRES
(posterior
reversible encephalopathy syndrome).
3. Small punctate foci of restricted diffusion within the left
frontal and
right parietal lobes, likely small embolic infarcts.
.
CT HEAD [**2106-5-20**]
Dramatically progressed subcortical hypodensities in bilateral
cerebral hemispheres with early left uncal herniation. The
differential in the context of HIV is broad and includes
vascular etiologies (posterior reversible encephalopathy
syndrome), infectious etiologies, PML, metabolic
encephalopathy, and less likely HIV encephalopathy.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course by problem:
.
Respiratory failure: Legionella positive (matching clinical sx
of (1) diarrhea, (2) hyponatremia, (3) office coworkers ill en
masse).  Underlying contribution from COPD; question of PCP
given no outpatient ppx.  The patient was intubated shortly
after admission for hypoxia/respiratory failure.  He was
ventilated per ARDSnet protocol, though very difficult to
oxygenate.  He initially required proning to improve
oxygenation.  He continued to have difficulty with ventilation
eventually requiring paralysis with cisatracurium, and a
pentobarbital induced coma.  He was eventually taken off the
proning bed, and eventually was weaned off paralysis and was
maintained on pressure control.  He was switched to assist
control, and eventually as his oxygenation improved, he was
switched to pressure support.  He had a tracheostomy placed on
[**2106-5-14**] as well as a PEG tube.  He continued to improve from a
respiratory standpoint.  During his course, he was noted to have
a pleural effusion, which was difficult to perform a
thoracentesis because of his positioning and difficulty with
dysynchronus breathing.  He developed a pneumothorax which
required chest tube placement by thoracic surgery.  He was
eventually weaned off of respiratory support fully and his chest
tube was removed.
.
Sepsis:  Source likely legionella.  He was initially started on
vancomycin, levofloxacin, cefepime, and oseltamivir which was
stopped once when the influenza test was negative.  He was
maintained on the levofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin and
because of his poor respiratory status, azithromycin was added
for double coverage of legionella.  He continued to spike very
high temperatures (>103) despite antibiotics and despite
negative cultures.  Eventually, it was thought that he was
having a drug fever, so all of his antibiotics were stopped, but
he did complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin.  Despite being
off antibiotics, he continued to spike fevers.  His cultures
(sputum, blood, stool, urine) all remained negative.  He had
viral studies sent which were also negative.  He was never
hypotensive requiring pressors, though at one point during his
hospitalization, he was transiently hypotensive with MAPs in the
50s-60s which responded to IVFs.  He developed acute kidney
injury secondary to his sepsis, and he also developed DIC.  He
was given a 96 hr course of activated protein C when he
developed these multiple organ failures.  Dur
