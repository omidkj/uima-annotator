Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Core Valve

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CoreValve/TAVR

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 81yo caucasian male with known aortic stenosis,
CAD s/p CABG x 3([**2088**]) and PCI-[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 11641**] ([**4-8**]), ischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF20-25%),PPM/ICD, GI bleed (duodenal AVM), htn
who was undergoing evaluation for aortic valve replacement.
Serial echocardiograms demonstrated progressive aortic stenosis
with ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.0cm2, mean gradient 27mmHG, reduced EF 23%). He
reports shortness of breath walking less than 100feet, periods
of shortness of breath at rest. He is able to go up six stairs
before stopping due to shortness of breath. His daily activities
have been greatly reduced. He denies light headedness or
dizziness. He admits to occasional chest pressure, last episode
this am. He was evaluated for aortic valve replacement and he
was deemed not a surgical candidate for conventional AVR due to
heavily calcified aorta. He was referred for TAVR evaluation. He
met all inclusion criteria and did not meet any exclusion
criteria. After informed consent, he was screened and accepted
for the Corevalve/TAVR procedure.

STUDIES:
([**10-21**]) CXR: Pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and right
ventricle.  Cardiomegaly is moderate.  Mediastinal position is
stable.  Diffuse interstitial opacities are unchanged since the
prior study.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

([**10-22**]) CXR:  Successful Core-Valve device placement without
evidence of
increasing pulmonary congestion or pneumothorax.

[**2115-10-27**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis and regional
thinning/akinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall,
antero-septum, distal LV and apex. No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. An aortic CoreValve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-10-23**], no
major change.

([**10-23**]) ECHO:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20-25%) secondary to dyskinesis of the distal septum and
apex, akinesis of the basal-mid anterior septum and distal
anterior wall and mild-moderate hypokinesis of the remaining
segments. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
mitral regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-4-10**],
there is a well seated aortic CoreValve prosthesis with normal
transvalvular gradients and trace aortic regurgitation. The
degree of mitral regurgitation has decreased. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension is now appreciated (pulmonary
pressures could not be determined on the prior study).

[**10-22**] Echo

Pre valve Implant

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
20 %). with mild global RV free wall hypokinesis. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Moderate
