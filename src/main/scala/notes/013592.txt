.
CXR#1:  Increased airspace opacity involving the bilateral lung
bases. Diagnostic considerations include pneumonia. Equivocal,
small, left-sided pleural effusion.
.
CXR #2: Interval mild-to-moderate worsening of the bibasilar
airspace opacities, now associated with retrocardiac
consolidation. Also, worsening in bibasilar pleural effusions as
compared to three days ago.
.
CXR#3: Small bilateral pleural effusions greater in the right
side have decreased in amount. Mild pulmonary edema is resolved.
Cardiac size is normal. The aorta is unfolded. There is no
pneumothorax.
.
TEE
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular systolic function is normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate/severe
bileaflet mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Impression: Bileaflet mitral valve prolapse with moderate mitral

regurgitation. No echo evidence of endocarditis.
.
RUQ U/S: Findings equivocal for acute cholecystitis. If this
remains a clinical concern HIDA scan could be performed.
.
CT chest/abd/pelvis:
1. Distended gallbladder with intraluminal stones and debris.
Cholecystitis cannot be excluded from this study and if clinical
concern, recommend ultrasound for further evaluation.

2. Bibasilar consolidation consistent with pneumonia and a small
right-sided effusion.

3. Ventral and left inguinal hernias. No evidence of bowel
obstruction.

4. Air within the bladder and anterior bladder diverticulum,
please clinically correlate (? recent Foley placement).
.
TTE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).

Brief Hospital Course:
#s/p Fall:  though patient unable to give much history, no focal
neuro findings; serial CE negative.  Head CT without ICH or CVA.
.
#MSSA Bacteremia/PNA:  bacteremia likely from underlying PNA.
Given lower lobe PNA, ? if patient aspirated after he fell.
Regardless, initially treated with Levaquin, but then switched
to IV Nafcillin per ID recommendations.  Will complete a total
of a 3 week course from last negative culture.  TEE negative for
endocarditis. Repeat TTE also negative for endocarditis.
.
#ileus:On [**3-1**] pt. developed n/v and abd distention worrisome for
a bowel obx. An NGT was placed which drained ~1L fluid after
placement c/w obstruction. However, CT abdomen did not show
bowel obx. It revealed a dilated GB with some stones. A follow
up RUQ U/S showed a dilated GB with stones, no wall thickening
and negative son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name (NI) **] sign. Given no clinical signs of
cholecystitis a HIDA scan was not persued. ID was consulted
however given that
