Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4643**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2163-3-17**] for an elective left
total knee replacement. Pre-operatively, she was consented,
prepped, and brought to the operating room. Intra-operatively,
she was closely monitored and remained hemodynamically stable.
She tolerated the procedure well without any difficulty or
complication. Post-operatively, she was transferred to the PACU
and floor for further recovery. On POD #1, oxygen saturation was
low (high 80's). Additional oxygen was given with some
improvement. Her urine output was low and several boluses of
fluids and 2 doses of Lasix were given. She became hypotensive
and her Creatinine was elevated to 1.3. A chest x-ray was
negative for any new pulmonary issues. She was transferred to
the SICU for medical management and monitoring. Her hematocrit
dropped to 24.5. She was transfused 2 units of PRBC for
postoperative anemia. She then remained hemodynamically stable.
A repeat chest x-ray showed a questionable left lower lobe
infiltrate. She was started on Levofloxacin for pneumonia
prophylaxis. Her pain was controlled. A chest CT ruled out a
pulmonary embolus. Her urine output, creatinine, and blood
pressure have all resolved. On POD #5, she was transferred back
to the step-down unit for further management. She worked with
physical therapy to improve her strength and mobility. She
continued to make steady progress without further incident. She
was discharged to a rehabilitation facility in stable condition.
