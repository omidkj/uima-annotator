Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Cold foot

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Angiography/stent left Superficial Femoral Artery


History of Present Illness:
86 y/o male with a hx of 3V CAD, CHF - EF 35%, chronic afib,
DM2, PVD s/p bypass L [**Doctor Last Name **]-->DP in [**2168**], recent dx of colon CA
s/p R colectomy on [**2173-8-19**] at [**Hospital1 336**] with post-op complications
including confusion, MS changes that resolved with time. Patient
was sent to rehab post-op where he had a fall on L leg, with ?
trauma to L leg. Pt was noticed to have a cold L foot, and he
was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for continued evaluation on [**9-3**].
Pt had angiography on HD 1 which showed 1. Total occlusion of
the left SFA, Total occlusion of the left SFA to DP graft, 3.
Successful stenting of the left SFA, 4. Failed intervention on
the SFA to DP graft, 5. Successful Angioseal. Pt with successful
stent placement, and post-procedure, pt had warm foot to
palpation. On HD3, per notes, patient was noted to be
"pleasantly confused, not oriented to place" with low UOP that
responded to fluid boluses. Pt was also noted to be in mild CHF,
with 2+ edema noted. Over the next 2 days, pt with decreased
appetite, poor PO intake, and continued confusion, with
decreased spontaneous movement, requiring restraints to prevent
removal of Foley.
On HD 6, gerontology was consulted for delirium, noting cause
likely multifactorial from environment, stress post-procedure,
and med effect. Recommended zyprexa prn, trazadone 25mg qhs,
d/cing cipro, haldol and foley. Patient continued to have waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] changes in his MS, with occasional clearing of
sensorium. Patient was being diuresed for his CHF, when on
HD10-12, was noted to have worsening somnolence, lack of
spontaneous movement, poor PO intake, and depression. Pt was
transferred to the medicine for continued care so that he may be
transferred to a [**Hospital1 1501**] for continued rehab.
Currently, denies any complaints of CP, SOB, DOE, or orthopnea.
Does have a wet cough that has persisted over the past 2 weeks

admits to decreased appetite, but denies any deconditioning or
generalized weakness, saying PT never comes on his schedule.
Otherwise no complaints today.

C cath-- FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Total occlusion of the left SFA,
2. Total occlusion of the left SFA to DP graft.
3. Successful stenting of the left SFA.
4. Failed intervention on the SFA to DP graft.
5. Successful Angioseal.

ART DUP EXT LO UNI;F/U: IMPRESSION: Patent bypass graft left
lower extremity. The increased velocity in the native vessel
distal to the graft could indicate some arterial disease in the
native vessel.

Noncontrast head CT: IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes and left parietal
infarct.

EKG: [**9-3**]
Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities - cannot rule out myocardial
ischemia. Low QRS voltage in the limb leads. No previous.

CXR [**9-10**]
1. Slight improvement in patchy bibasilar opacities, which could
be due to improving atelectasis or aspiration. Underlying
infectious pneumonia not fully excluded in the appropriate
clinical setting.
2. Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 86 y/o male with a hx of 3V CAD, CHF - EF 35%, chronic

including confusion, MS changes that resolved with time, s/p
angiography and stent for cold L foot, with post-procedure
confusion, waxing MS.
1. Mental status change:
Patient with decreased memory with intact attentiveness. His
orientation waxed and waned throughout the day since he was
transfered to the medicine team. Aparently patient had a post op
delerium since his colon resection. It was felt that there was
also an elemtne of dementia present that coupled with
environment and meds lead to confusion. All psychoactive meds
were held. Patient was given Ziprexa as needed for agitation
episodes. Mental status partially improved.

2. CHF
Patient with decreased systolic fxn, last EF 35%. On transfer to
medicine team, patient had continued symptoms of poorly
controlled CHF with stable/normal vitals. Patient was gently
diuresed and he was make euvolemic. Creatinine remained stable.
Patient was continued on BB blocker, ace inhibitor and laxis.

3. A-fib
Patient with chronic a-fib. Patient was continued on coumadin to
maintained INR around 2.0 (prevent bleeding). On day of
discharged INR was 2.0. Patient ventricular rate was well
controlled during hospital stay.

4. Peripheral vascular disease
Patient had angioplasty/stent to SFA during hospitalization.
Favorable course. Patient was folled by the vascular surgery
team during his stay on medicine team. NO complications. Good
pulses and [**Last Name (un) 5355**] was warm. Patient was continued on plavix and
aspirin

5. DM2 - Patient was controlled with insulin sliding scale
during hospital stay
-Cont Insulin SS.

6. ID
Patient had a U/A with WBCs, mod bacteria on urine, but negative
urine cx x2. Since patient remained afebrile, WBC stable and no
symptoms abx were held. Subsequent U/A was sent and was negative
for leuks or nitrates.

7. F/E/N
Patient with decreased PO intake during hospital stayed.
Nutrition recomendations were followed. Electrolytes were
repleated PRN.

8. Mechanical Fall: In the morning on day of discharged patient
was found on the floor. Neurological exam did not show any focal
deifict. CT scan done- negative for acute intracraneal pathology
