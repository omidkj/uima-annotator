Chief Complaint:
Dynamic Chest CT


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
77F with emphysema predominant COPD being transferred from
[**Hospital1 **] following her third COPD exacerbation in three months.
Her episodes are characterized by lots of coughing and wheezing
worsened by anxiety, and in between her exacerbations she
continues to wheeze.  The coughing episodes are so severe that
she would likely trigger or code on the floor for respiratory
faillure, however when she calms down and the symptoms stop.  Of
note Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4507**] was able to obtain an ABG in the setting of one
of these event which was 7.39 38 58 on 2L.
.
Her most recent admission was initially for fever and concern
for pneumonia sepsis.  In the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] she received broad
specturm abx, and a femoral line was placed through which she
briefly received levophed.   She came off of the pressors easily
after 5-6 L IVF and she was felt to be dehydrated from poor POs
and diarrhea. The following morning her hospitalist narrowed her
abx to levaquin, for lack of sirs criteria.  C. Diff was sent x1
and is pending and her stool culture revealed many staph aureus.
 DFA was negative for flu, BCX has been negative x 2, U/A was
bland and UCX was not sent.
.
At the time of transfer she was on solumderol 60mg q8h.  She
often refuses bipap however today she went on bipap 14/10 with
continued expiratory wheezes.  ENT scoped her to the larynx at
[**Hospital1 **] which was quite unremarkable.
.
The decision was made to transfer her to the [**Hospital1 **] for a dynamic CT
chest for differentiation of TBM vs bad emphysema.   In general
it has been felt that these episodes are quite steroid
resistant.
.
She recently made herself DNR/DNI.
.
On arrival to the floor, she is audibly wheezy but otherwise in
no distress.  She states she is happy to be here.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
77F with PMH of COPD/[**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for more
aggressive work-up of recurrent and recalcitrant COPD flares
after presenting with dyspnea and hypotension secondary to
hypovolemia vs sepsis. Has moderately severe
tracheobronchomalacia but not interested in invasive
interventions so managing COPD medically, on bronchodilators and
steroids.

# COPD/tracheobronchomalacia: Patient has had multiple
hospitalizations over the last several months for COPD
exacerbations.  She was admitted to an outside hospital with
dyspnea and hypotension with concern for sepsis.  She stabilized
with IVFs, steroids, and broad spectrum antibiotics (received
vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin) at the outside hospital but
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because of concern for
tracheobronchomalacia as a significant contributor to her
dyspnea.  After being admitted to MICU, she had a CT that
demonstrated moderately severe tracheobronchomalacia but she
refused bronchoscopy/stent
