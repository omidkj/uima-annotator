History of Present Illness:
History dervied from report from floor team and patient's wife
as patient unable to provide much at time of transfer. Briefly,
this is a 76 yo male with h/o HTN, RAS, thoracic dissection s/p
stent and abdominal AAA repair who intially presented to the ED
on [**9-11**] after experiencing a syncopal episode on [**9-10**].  He was
at the pharmacy and had a witnessed syncopal event. At that time
had no CP, N/V, SOB, diaphoresis. He awoke and felt weak but
otherwise okay and elected to go to the ED on [**9-10**]. He came in
for evaluation on [**9-11**] as he was feeling generally fatigued. Per
wife, he has been very fatigeud and sleepy for the past few
days.
.
In the ED --> was hypertensive with SBP ~ 200. He was given IV
and PO lopressor, followed by hydralazine IV, and was ultimately
transferred on a nitroglycerin gtt. CXR showed postoperative
changes, low lung volumes, no obvious infiltrate. His head CT
was negative for ICH. Given intermittent hypoxia while in the
ED, underwent V/Q scan --> low prob for PE.
.
On arrival to floor, patient still on nitro gtt. When floor team
evaluated the patient they noted him to be very somnolent but
able to answer questions when asked.  They also noted him to be
intermittent hypoxic with sats 85-100% on face mask. ABG with pH
7.18/ pCO2 106/pO2 82. Patient was given lasix 40 mg IV x 1. EKG
was unremarkable. CE sent. ECHO with LVEF > 55%, pulmonary HTN.
Given hypercarbia, patient was transferred to the ICU for closer
monitoring.
.
On transfer to ICU patient started on CPAP, which he did not
tolerate. He was then intubated. Following intubation, BP
dropped with SBP 70-90 and patient was briefly on dopamine. This
was weaned off and patient was again hypertensive and nitro gtt
restarted.

Past Medical History:
- hypertension - per patient, SBPs 120-130 with home cuff
- ? CAD
- elevated cholesterol
- PAF (in setting of bleed / surgery)
- s/p endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm ([**2191-4-25**])
complicated by hemothorax / VATS
- s/p ballooning of thoracic stent in [**6-22**] to manage type I
endoleak
- s/p infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
- chronic renal insufficiency - baseline Cr 1.6, renal scan in
6/0 shows no visible blood flow to right kidney - left kidney
appears to be performing 90 % of the total renal function and
the right kidney performing  10%
- right hydronephrosis - s/p ureteral stent in [**6-23**]
- Obesity

Renal ultrasound
[**2192-9-13**]
Bilateral kidney demonstrate echogenic cortex which may be
associated with a variety of diffuse parenchymal renal diseases.
There is no evidence of obstruction, hydronephrosis or calculi.
Technically limited Doppler evaluation however no definitive
evidence of renal artery stenosis was seen
.
CTA [**9-13**]
1. Post endovascular repair of the thoracic aortic aneurysm,
there is persistent significant endoleak with slight increase in
the size of the thoracic aortic aneurysm as described above.

2. Stable aortic dissection with the left main renal artery
supplied by the false lumen, the celiac artery, superior
mesenteric artery, right renal artery and accessory left renal
artery supplied by the true lumen.

3. Stable appearance to the excluded right common iliac artery
aneurysm with retrograde filling. Stable right external iliac
artery aneurysm.

4. Cardiomegaly with bibasilar effusions and passive atelectasis
of the lower lobes likely suggestive of CCF.

5. JJ stent in a decompressed atrophic right kidney and stable
renal hypodensities, likely cysts.

6. Stable left adrenal myelolipoma.
.
V/Q scan [**9-11**]
1. Low likelihood ratio for acute pulmonary embolism. 2.
Findings consistent with a tortuous thoracic aorta, as seen on
CXR, as well as central tracer pooling suggestive of airways
disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo male who presents after a syncopal episodes two days ago,
now with hypertensive urgency and marked fatigue. On the floor
noted to be increasingly somnolent and found to have an elevated
CO2.
.
#Syncope
Patient initially presented for syncope work-up.  Although soon
after admission he required mechanical ventilation for
hypercarbic respiratory failure, many etiologies of syncope were
inadvertently evaluated during admission.  Telemetry showed many
PVC's but no malignant arrhythmias.  Echocardiogram revealed
moderate concentric LVH, mild AS, grade I diastolic dysfunction,
and moderate pulmonary hypertension.  EKG and subsequent cardiac
enzymes ruled him out for a myocardial infarction.  CTA of the
chest showed increased size of thoracic aneurysm, however
without rupture.  The most likely sources of syncope include
hypercarbia or vaso-vagal syncope.  He will require follow up
with his PCP in two weeks (appointment scheduled).
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure
During initiation of hospitalization patient experienced sudden
hypercarbic respiratory failure which required mechanical
ventiliation and itubation.  Patient has extensive smoking
history as well as history of CPAP use at night.  In conjunction
with chronically elevated bicarbonate, provision dx of COPD and
OSA are likely contributors to his respiratory failure.  He was
initially ruled out for pneumonia and pulmonary embolus.
Treatment for pneumonia included vancomycin / piperacillin -
tazobactam x 5 days for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia,
however subsequent BAL showed no evidence of this.  Patient also
has a history of diastolic dysfunction, which may have
contributed to impaired ventilation; CXR showed evidence of
pulmonary congestion and patient was diuresed as well.  Patient
was extubated on hospital day eight and transferred to the
floor.  Diuresis and nebulization w/ albuterol / atrovent were
continued and incentive spirometry was started.  PT was
consulted and recommended home with PT.  At discharge the
patient required 2L of oxygen by nasal cannula to keep his O2
sats > 91%.  The new O2 requirement was thought to be secondary
to his not-fully diagnosed COPD and OSA.  We recommended that he
follow up with his PCP for likely [**Name9 (PRE) 1570**]'s in the future.  Home VNA
and PT was also established.  Lastly, he was also continued on
albuterol / atrovent until further workup with his PCP.
