Chief Complaint:
right lower lobe mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2170-2-5**]
Exploratory right thoracoscopy, right thoracotomy
and right lower lobectomy, pleural tenting, intercostal

lavage.


History of Present Illness:
70 year old female who had an incidentally discovered
abnormality on CXR performed in [**Month (only) 216**] with CT of the chest
demonstrating a peripherally located, broad-based right lower
lobe lesion. Initial pathology on brushings/washings
[**2169-11-4**] were initially thought positive for malignancy but
after review the pathology report was ammended to "suspicious
for well differentiated adenocarcinoma" and it was recommended
to obtain more tissue. She was seen in the clinic on [**2169-11-7**]
and CT-guided core needle biopsy was recommended at that time.
Unfortunately the patient fell ill with a severe pneumonia prior
to this being accomplished and resulted in hospitalization
during the end of [**Month (only) **]/beginning of [**Month (only) 1096**] and treatment
with a course of Meropenem. Of note her pneumonia involved the
region of the lung containing the lesion of interest.

CXR ([**2170-2-9**]): FINDINGS: Following removal of two right-sided
chest tubes, there has probably not been a substantial change in
the appearance of several loculated hydropneumothoraces in the
right hemithorax allowing for technical differences between the
studies. Subcutaneous emphysema in right chest wall also appears
similar. Postoperative volume loss is again demonstrated in the
right hemithorax consistent with recent lobectomy procedure.
Slight worsening in atelectasis at right base. Left lung and
pleural surfaces are clear.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery service after
elective operation. Her hospital course was as follows by
system.

Neuro: An epidural was placed pre-operatively however she
continued to have increased pain and this was then split. On POD
2 the epidural was removed and she was transitioned to PO pain
medications with good effect.

CV: Her vital signs were routinely monitored. On POD 1 she was
startedon Neo for low blood pressures and this was weaned off
later that day. She remained hemodynacmally stable for the
remainder of the hospitalization.

Pulmonary:  The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored.  Good pulmonary toilet,
early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged
throughout this hospitalization. Her chest tubes remained on
suction. On POD 3 after clamping trial the apical tube was
removed oand the anterior tube was removed on POD 4. Post-pull
CXR did not demonstrate pneumothorax.

GI/GU/FEN:

Post operatively, the patient was made NPO with IVF.

The patient's diet was advanced to regular diet on POD2, which
was tolerated well.

The patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IVF
were adjusted when necessary.  The patient's electrolytes were
routinely followed during this hospitalization, and repleted
when necessary.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection.

Endocrine:  The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
this stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology:  The patient received 6 units of blood intraop. The
patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no
transfusions were required during the remainder of her stay.

Prophylaxis:  The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled. She will follow up in clinic and will have a follow
up chest xray prior to her appointment.
