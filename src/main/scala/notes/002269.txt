Troponins remained negative.
Chest xray showed mild congestive heart failure and underlying
consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxic respiratory distress:
Patient arrived in respiratory distress. Initially felt to be
CHF by ED staff, and given sub-lingual nitroglycerin, especially
given chest pain, hypertension, and CXR findings. Had elevated
CK to 500s; normalized during hospital course. Cardiac fractions
were never elevated. Negative troponins, no EKG changes noted.
Given fever in ED and CXR appearance, ICU staff felt the patient
more had community-acquired pneumonia and she was started on
ceftrixone and azithromycin.  Patient improved on antibx
treatment (improved leukocystosis, afebrile).
.
# Hypotension:
Differential includes medication-related secondary to
nitroglycerin versus sepsis from pulmonary process. Developed
pressure as low as 87/50 on the unit and her home
anti-hypertensive medications were held. Lactate also trended
down (4.0->2.5).  Patient responded well to IVF hydration alone.
 UOP, which had dipped down to 10cc/hr, improved with hydration.
.
# Chest pain:
Patient complained of chest pain in the ED.  At the time,
differential included coronary artery disease (no known history,
though has known vascular disease including CVA in past) and
pneumonia, among other causes.  Troponins were consistently
negative.  No EKG changes suggestive of ischemia. CK was
elevated but normalized; MB fraction was not elevated.  Daily
ASA was started and continued.
.
# History of hyperlipidemia/TIA: Continued statin and aggrenox.
