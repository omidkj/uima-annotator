Admission Date:  [**2114-2-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2114-3-13**]

Date of Birth:   [**2082-3-28**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer for hypercapneic respiratory
failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a morbidly obese
31 year old female with a history of asthma (recent admission
to outside hospital, no history of intubations), who was in
her usual state of health until approximately two weeks prior
to admission when she began experiencing increasing shortness
of breath at home, not improving with her outpatient asthma
medications.  She began using her father's home oxygen.

She was admitted to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital on [**2114-2-8**].
Arterial blood gases on admission revealed pH 7.19, pCO2 of
108 and pO2 of 119.  Her bicarbonate level at that time was
37.  She was treated with BIPAP, [**Last Name (un) **]-Dur, Solu-Medrol which
was switched to Prednisone.  Chest x-ray reportedly was
unremarkable at that time.  She improved with treatment and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 34648**].

Admitted to [**Hospital1 34648**] on [**2114-2-14**], with arterial blood gases of
pH of 7.41, pCO2 of 86 and pO2 of 84 on 40% FIO2 face mask.
She was aggressively diuresed and plan was for rehabilitation
with subsequent follow-up at [**Hospital 34649**] Clinic.  She began to do
poorly, however, with increasing shortness of breath and
occasional nonproductive cough.  Arterial blood gases showed
pH of 7.31, pCO2 of 131 and pO2 of 63 on 90%.  She was placed
on BIPAP and unable to be weaned off.

Over that time, she denied fever, chills, chest pain,
light-headedness, confusion, calf pain.  She was treated with
Enoxaparin prophylactically.  She did describe some nasal
stuffiness.  She was started on Augmentin for suspected
sinusitis and Levaquin was added on [**2114-2-23**], for possible
pneumonia when her chest x-ray showed white out of the right
lung.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] at that time for likely tracheostomy.

ALLERGIES:  Vicodin and Percocet.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her parents.  No history of
tobacco or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, in general, morbidly
obese female with marked respiratory distress speaking in
complete sentences and mentally alert.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat anicteric sclera.  The pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  No sinus tenderness.  Mucous membranes
are moist with no oral lesions.  The heart is regular rate
and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with a II/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the left upper sternal border radiating to the
carotids.  Lungs - bilateral crackles two thirds of the way
up on the right, half way up on the left.  The abdomen is
morbidly obese, soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm, 2+ distal pulses bilaterally, no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Arterial blood gases revealed a pH of 7.33,
pCO2 116, pO2 70 on 90% FIO2.  Chest x-ray showed white out
of the right hemithorax and one half of the way up on the
left.  White count 5.8, hematocrit 33.9, platelets 259,000,
Sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 84, bicarbonate 53, blood
urea nitrogen 10, creatinine 0.4, glucose 93.  Prothrombin
time 13.4, partial thromboplastin time 26.5, INR 1.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and initially she was alternated between
100% nonrebreather and BIPAP at 18/8. She was continued on
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers, Flovent meter dose inhaler
and Levofloxacin for a seven day course of empiric treatment
for pneumonia.  Over the next two days, her breathing did not
improve significantly despite the above measures and in the
a.m. of [**2114-2-26**], her pCO2 had climbed to 132, and she was
less mentally responsive.  She was then intubated and over
the next few hours, she was unable to wean down from 100%
FIO2 and was changed to pressure control ventilation for
better oxygenation.  She was subsequently weaned down to 50%
FIO2.

Bronchoscopy on [**2114-2-26**], revealed edematous airways that
were collapsible on expiration, however, there was no visible
plugging or secretions.  She was evaluated for tracheostomy
at the bedside by Doctor [**Last Name (Titles) **], but was felt to be a poor
candidate for the bedside procedure secondary to her obesity
and high PEEP.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 20042**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and she was
scheduled for tracheostomy to be performed in the operating
room. In the meantime, she made gradual improvement in her
respiratory function with lower driving pressure requirements
on pressure control ventilation. She was changed back to
assist control on the morning of [**2114-2-28**].

The patient was unable to be transported to the operating
room due to her size.  The tracheostomy was changed to a
bedside procedure performed by CT Surgery which was done on
[**2114-3-6**].  Complication was only moderate amount of blood
loss.  She tolerated the procedure well.  She was taken off
all sedatives and began to wake up at that time.  She was
then turned to pressure support ventilation and continued at
a PEEP of 20.  The PEEP was unable to be weaned down
secondary to her overall size and relative supine position.

The second issue is her infectious disease issue.  She had
intermittent temperature spikes to 101.  She completed an
initial course of Levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia which
had been started on admission to the [**Hospital1 190**].  Blood cultures drawn on [**2114-3-2**], began to
grow gram positive cocci that was later identified as
staphylococcus epidermidis.  She had subsequent positive
blood cultures with the same organism from her central line.
Her left IJ line was switched to a right IJ which also began
to grow gram positive cocci.

Eventually all central lines were removed and peripheral
access was obtained.  She was continued on Vancomycin.  Given
the multiple positive blood cultures and high grade
bacteremia, a Transesophageal Echocardiogram was performed
that showed no evidence of valvular vegetation and a normal
ejection fraction. It was planned that she would complete a
four week course of Vancomycin for her high grade bacteremia
and possible endovascular source.

She continued to spike fever despite treatment with
Vancomycin and a subsequent respiratory culture began to grow
pseudomonas.  She was started on Levofloxacin and Ceftazidime
for treatment to complete a ten day course of these.  Her
white count has trended down and she has been afebrile since
started on these antibiotics and is stable from an infectious
disease standpoint.

Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition - She was started on tube
feeds via nasogastric tube.  The plan is for her to take p.o.
intake at a later time.  Her goal for her tube feeds is 80 cc
per hour with replete with fiber.  She has required
occasional fluid boluses for decreased urine output at times.


Prophylaxis - She has been treated with subcutaneous Heparin
t.i.d. as well as p.o. Zantac.

Access - The patient is to be evaluated for a PICC line prior
to transfer to [**Hospital1 34648**].

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be transferred to [**Hospital1 34648**] when
a bed is available.  She is a full code.  Her family is very
supportive and have been present regularly throughout her
hospitalization.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Morbid obesity with obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
2.  Asthma.
3.  Anxiety/depression.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ceftazidime one gram intravenously q8hours to comple
