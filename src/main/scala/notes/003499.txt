ADDENDUM.

The patient was admitted on [**2162-7-5**] for preop optimization and
IVIG infusion and taken to the operating room by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] where the patient underwent R TKA. The procedure was well
tolerated and there were no complications. Please see the
separately
dictated operative report for details regarding the surgery. The
patient was subsequently transferred to the post-anesthesia care
unit
in stable condition and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] later that day
for observation of her airway given he hx of angioedema and
complicated medical hx.
Overnight, the patient was placed on a PCA for pain control w/
ketamin drip as per the pain service. IV
antibiotics were continued for 24 hours postoperatively as per
routine. Lovenox was started the morning of postop day 1 for DVT
prophylaxis. The patient was placed in a CPM machine with range
of
motion set at 0-45 degrees of flexion up to 90 degrees as
tolerated.
The drain was removed without incident. The patient was weaned
off of
the PCA and ketamin onto oral pain medications. The Foley
catheter was removed
without incident. The surgical dressing was also removed, and
the
surgical incision was found to be clean, dry, and intact without
erythema nor purulent drainage.

During the hospital course the patient was seen daily by
physical
therapy. Labs were checked both post-operatively and throughout
the
hospital course and repleted accordingly. The patient was
tolerating
regular diet and otherwise feeling well. Prior to discharge the
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. Hematocrit was
stable
and pain was adequately controlled on a PO regimen. The
operative
extremity was neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.
The
patient was discharged to home with service or rehabilitation in
