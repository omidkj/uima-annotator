Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2162-4-28**] 9:35 PM
IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study. Left lower lobe atelectasis
likely although an early developing pneumonia cannot be entirely
excluded. If clinically feasible, consider further evaluation
with PA and lateral view.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2162-4-29**] 3:20 PM
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe infiltrate
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2162-4-29**] 9:02 AM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of overt edema. Retrocardiac opacity
likely represents atelectasis; however, early infectious process
cannot be entirely excluded.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-4-29**] 2:04 AM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage.
.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT  [**2162-4-29**] 1:29 AM
IMPRESSION: Extensive, acute-appearing occlusive thrombus within
the left internal jugular, left subclavian, and left axillary
veins. These findings were phoned immediately to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
.
ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  [**2162-5-4**] 9:07 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No intrinsic hepatic or biliary pathology is identified.
Passive hepatic congestion is most likely cause for the elevated
transaminase level.
2. Mild splenomegaly.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-5-5**] 9:03 AM
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology, including no sign
of intracranial hemorrhage.
.
RENAL U.S.  [**2162-5-7**] 10:38 AM
IMPRESSION:
1.Increased echogenicity of the liver consistent with fatty
liver. However, other forms of liver disease and more advanced
liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis
cannot be excluded. Passive hepatic congestion is a likely cause
in this patient.
2) No hydronephrosis is detected. Non-obstructive stone of the
mid pole of the left kidney measures 7 mm in greatest dimension.

3) Ascites and bilateral pleural effusion are present
.
C.CATH Study Date of [**2162-5-7**]
COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right and
left heart
pressures with a mean RA of 22mmHg and mean PCWP of 27mmHg.
There was
moderate pulmonary artery hypertension with a PASP of 57mmHg.
The
cardiac index was severely depressed at 1.2l/min/m2.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
2. Markedly reduced cardiac index.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2162-5-8**] 9:38 AM
IMPRESSION: Feeding tube placement as described
.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2162-5-8**] 7:56 AM
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
Swan- Ganz catheter tip is in the right pulmonary artery. The
heart remains enlarged but stable. Left pacemaker leads
terminate in standard position. Compared to prior study dated
[**2162-4-29**] there has been interval increase in right
small-to- moderate pleural effusion. There is mild interstitial
pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
