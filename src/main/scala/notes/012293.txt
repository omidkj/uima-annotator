Allergies:
Klonopin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
75 year-old woman with h/o tracheobronchomalacia and COPD
complicated by vocal chord dysfunction and uses home O2 3L at
night who presented to OSH with increased SOB over past 3 days
and hypoxia. Pt reports that she progressed from dyspnea on
exertion to dyspnea at rest. She has been using frequent nebs
with minimal relief. Was here 1 m ago with similar presentation.
She recieved solumedrol and azithromycin at OSH prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. She was transfered for increased work of
breathing and need for BiPAP. Vitals on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED were
T 97.4, HR 94, BP 129/68, RR 38, sat 96% on 10L. In the ED here,
she was immediately placed on BiPAP and required 1mg Ativan for
anxiety.  Pt reported feeling better with BiPAP. Abx were
broadended with levofloxacin 750mg, CTX 1g, and vanco 1g. CXR
showed a LLL PNA. Exam was remarkable for poor air movement.
Labs in ED remarkable for bicarb of 16, lactate 4.3, and WBC 6.9
with 92% PMNs.

Her last admission was [**Date range (1) 18230**] for presumed COPD flare
and also included a 24 hour stay in the ICU for BiPAP. Of note,
she has had > 6 admissions to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital over the past 6
months for similar symptoms. She continues to smoke and last
admission reported that she only takes spiriva and pulmicort on
a prn basis. Pt says today that she uses her albuterol and
"rescue" inhalers as needed.  Bronch last admission showed only
10,000-100,000 yeast.

On arrival to floor, pt continues to feel short of breath on
non-rebreather. She was unable to tolerate BiPAP 2/2
claustraphobia. She has a poor appetite, but denies N/V. She
denies singificant cough or fevers. C/o intermittent right ear
pain. She has chronic arthritic pains which are typical pains
for her. Otherwise, ROS is unremarkable.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2184-1-3**]**

   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2184-1-1**]):
      <10 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
      QUALITY OF SPECIMEN CANNOT BE ASSESSED.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2184-1-3**]):
      SPARSE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
.
PFT's [**8-/2182**]
FEV1/FVC 73%
TLC 95% predicted
DSB 39% predicted
Mechanics: The FVC and FEV1 are moderately reduced. The FEV1/FVC

ratio is normal. There was no significant change following
inhaled bronchodilator. Flow-Volume Loop: Moderate expiratory
coving with a moderately reduced volume excursion and an early
termination of exhalation. Lung Volumes: The TLC and FRC are
normal. The RV and RV/TLC ratio are elevated. DLCO: The Dsb
corrected for hemoglobin is moderately to markedly reduced.
Impression:
Moderate obstructive ventilatory defect with a moderate to
marked gas exchange defect. The FVC may be underestimated due to
early termination of exhalation. There are no prior studies
available for comparison.
.
CXR: Limited study due to apical lordotic positioning of the
patient and lack of visualization of the left costophrenic
angle. Emphysema with no definite evidence of acute superimposed
process. If clinically feasible, consider PA and lateral views
in the radiology suite, if indicated.
.
CT trachea w/ forced expiratory maneuver [**2183-11-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Distal tracheal narrowing of 53% is borderline for
tracheomalacia.
2. No evidence of bronchomalacia.
3. Diffuse severe emphysema.
$. New bilateral lower lobe bronchial wall thickening suggestive

of small airways disease. New lower lobe mucous plugging with
and
subsegmental atelectasis at both lung bases.
5. Chronic but not previously seen bilateral rib fractures
.
EKG: sinus tach, no ST changes
.
[**2183-12-30**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal study, pulmonary pressures not obtainable
because of technically-inadequate tricuspid regurgitation jet.
Grossly preserved biventricular systolic function.
