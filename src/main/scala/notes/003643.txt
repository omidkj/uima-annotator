History of Present Illness:
This is 41 year old male with history of cirrhosis secondary to
EtOH and hepatitis C virus, obstructive sleep apnea and
hypothyroidism, with recurrent episodes of severe
enceophalopathy and ascites.

Mr. [**Known lastname 19420**] was re-admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**1-9**] for worsening
encephalopathy. The patient has multiple admits for
encephalopathy (5 since [**8-27**]). He has had 10 MICU
admissions/floor transfers and at least 6 intubations since
[**2147-10-21**] as a result of his encephalopathy. He was
hospitalized from [**Date range (2) 77415**], during which time he had
recurrent episodes of encephalopathy requiring MICU admissions,
w/ one of them to be secondary to possible aspiration with
poorly-fitting CPAP mask. He was most recently hospitalized
again this month with discharge [**1-8**]. During this most recent
admission, he likewise required MICU level care for
encephalopathy and respiratory compromise when even a single
Lactulose dose was delayed. He has demonstrated that he is
exquisitely sensitive to any decrease in frequency of lactulose
administration, and the results of delayed or missed doses lead
to severe obtundation.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 42 year old gentleman with a history of cirrhosis
secondary to EtOH + HCV,  history of spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis, who has had multiple hospitalizations for
encephalopathy who presented with mental status changes again
consistent with  encephalopathy.

# Encephalopathy: The patient was admitted for mental status
change secondary to encephalopathy. Within 24 hours of admission
patient was transferred to the medical ICU for worsening
encephalopathy and witnessed vomiting/aspiration while on CPAP.
He was intubated & sedated for airway protection with an NG tube
placed for gastric decompression and medicine administration.
His chest x-ray and vital signs did not indicated any lung
damage. He was extubated approximately 24 hours later. The
patient's mental status cleared, he tolerated food and was
returned to the Liver-Kidney service.

The patient was transferred to the MICU again approximately 24
hours later for repeat altered mental status and
unresponsiveness without witnessed aspiration or known cause.
He was given lactulose, rifaximin and acidophilus and his mental
status cleared within 12 hours.  He was kept for 60 hours for
monitoring wherein he developed an additional episode of
somnolence that resolved with continued lactulose
administration.  He was again returned to the floor.

Patient's encephalopathy remained stable on the floor for nearly
1 week until he became acutely obtunded. He was witnessed
vomiting a small amount with subsequent aspiration. He was
transferred to the MICU for treatment and intubated again for
airway protection. Again lactulose and rifaximin were continued.
Patient was again extubated and called out to the liver service.

Close attention paid to patient receiving all scheduled
lactulose doses while on the floor. In addition patient started
on Zinc. He was also switched to a vegetarian diet so as to
reduce his intake of animal proteins. This combination of
treatments resulted in the patient's encephalopathy remaining
stable until discharge.

# Aspiration: Two of patient's transfers to the MICU were
related to concern for aspitation. Patient felt to develop an
aspiration pneumonitis  versus pneumonia. Sputum gram stain
showed gram positive cocci in clusters, chains and pairs. Cx
growing only oropharyngeal flora. Patient was treated with a 7
day course of vancomycin and cefepime. Patient was maintained on
aspiration precautions and was evaluated by speech and swallow
who recommended thin liquids and
ground consistency solids, Pills whole with thin liquids.

# Attempt at Spleno-renal Embolization: Patient underwent IR
guided spleno-renal embolization in an attempt to embolize
shunts in his liver which could be contributing to his
encephalopathy. Unfortunately, these shunts could not be
embolized during the procedure given team unable to pass into
the shunt from
the renal vein.

# End Stage Liver Disease: Secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
Patient required two therapeutic paracentesis which yielded
4liters and 3.5 liters respectively. Patien
