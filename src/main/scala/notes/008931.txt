History of Present Illness:
This is a 47 year old white male transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] SICU B
from [**Hospital6 1597**] for Right SDH with Right frontal IPH.
By OSH attending report and transfer paperwor review - this is a
47 year old homelss gentleman who stepped out of his car this am
to urinate and had sudden onset of substernal chest pain. He
collapsed but was able to get up to walk across the street to a
[**Company 2486**] where he collapsed again and was incontinent of
stool.  He crawled inside the store and asked someone to call
911.  He was brought to [**Last Name (un) 1724**] where workup revealed a massive PE
/saddle PE.  He was treated with t-PA from 715-915 the am of
admit.  At 11:15 am the intensivist noticed that the pt had
increased right periorbital ecchymosis. Shortly thereafter the
pt had deteriorated mental status requiring intubation.  He was
brought for CT brain which showed acute right sdh with 1.2cm of
MLS as well as a 5cm x 5 cm right frontal IPH with subfalcine
herniation per the [**Last Name (un) 1724**] radiologist (this examiner spoke with the
radiologist directly.) He arrived here at [**Hospital1 18**] at approximately
5pm - his exam was done on arrival with light sedation
(propofol) running.

Exam on Discharge:

sensation intact, right pronator drift potentially secondary to
right upper extremity weakness.

Pertinent Results:
CT Head [**2128-4-17**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right frontal lobar hemorrhage, compatible with a
hemorrhagic
contusion. However, this could also represent a hemorrhage
secondary to a
vascular lesion or mass, which could have caused a trauma,
resulting in the other posttraumatic findings. Detailed
correlation with the clinical course of events is recommended.

2. Extensive cerebral swelling, right greater than left, with
right
subfalcine and uncal herniation.

3. Large right subdural hematoma.

4. Large right frontal subgaleal hematoma and periorbital
hematoma, but no evidence of a fracture. The facial bones are
not fully imaged.

CT Head [**2128-4-17**]:
IMPRESSION: S/p evacuation of right subdural and right frontal
lobar
hematomas. Little change in right subfalcine and uncal
herniation, basal
cistern effacement, and ventricular compression.

CT Head [**2128-4-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased acute hemorrhage within the extraaxial, likely
epidural
collection in the right craniectomy site.
2. Improving right subfalcine herniation, which is now 8 mm
compared to prior 11 mm. Improved right uncal herniation.
Decreased compression of basal cisterns. Decreased compression
of the right lateral ventricle.

LENIS [**2128-4-18**]:
No DVTs noted

CT Orbital [**2128-4-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of intraorbital hematoma or globe injury. No
fracture. Please
refer to concurrent head CT report for findings related to the
brain and the scalp.

ECHO [**2128-4-19**]:
Normal. EF 55-60%

Head CT [**2128-4-22**]:
Improved right frontal extra-axial hyperdense collection with
less mass
effect upon the right frontal lobe. Midline shift has resolved.
Decreased size of right frontal hypodensity containing
intra-axial blood
products.

Head CT [**2128-4-24**]:
Unchanged from [**4-22**]

Head CT [**2128-4-26**]:
1. Subdural hypodense fluid collection at the left hemisphere
has doubled in size compared to [**2128-4-24**] and has extended to
the subdural space anterior to the right frontal lobe and to the
right interhemispheric fissure.
2. Significant increase of mass effect with new midline shift to
the right by about 1 cm and transgaleal herniation of the right
frontal lobe through the right frontal craniectomy site into the
subgaleal soft tissues.
3. Increase of the primarily left uncal herniation and beginning
early
entrapment of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
4. Unchanged ill-defined hypodensities in the left temporal,
occipital lobe and left anterior thalamus as well as the right
parietooccipital lobe
consistent with bilateral PCA infarctions.
5. No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage or new areas of
infarction.

Head CT [**2128-4-27**]:
Little change from one day prior, including transgaleal
herniation of the right frontal lobe through the craniectomy
site, left uncal herniation, 8 mm rightward shift of midline
structures, left greater than right subdural hygromas, right
frontal parenchymal hemorrhage, and multiple bilateral
hemispheric hypodensities consistent with infarcts. No new
intracranial hemorrhage.

LENIS [**2128-4-27**]:
Extensive deep vein thrombosis in the right common femoral,
superficial femoral and right popliteal veins. No deep vein
thrombosis is
seen in the left leg.

Chest Xray [**2128-4-27**]:
In comparison with the study of [**4-23**], there is improved aeration
at
the left base, though there is persistent bilateral pleural
fluid and
atelectasis. Upper lung zones are clear. The tip of the Dobbhoff
tube is not seen, though it appears to extend to at least the
second portion of the duodenum.

CT head [**2128-5-1**]:
No new intracranial hemorrhage seen. Continued evolution of
multiple abnormalities including decreasing density of both
intra- and extra- cranial hematomas, decreasing density of
multifocal infarcts, and decreasing mass effect with resolution
of right frontal transgaleal herniation and now reversal of
shift of the normally midline structures, currently towards the
left. Subdural hygromas remain, now increased on the right but
decreased on the left.

CT head [**2128-5-3**]:
Little interval changes from [**5-1**], with expected evolution of
the known
abnormalities. No new foci of intracranial hemorhage. Persistent
mild
leftward midline shift, now 4mm. Unchanged effacement of the R
lateral
ventricle. Unchange asymmetric temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. No hydrocephalus.
Small
bifrontal hydromas, unchanged in the R, and minimally decreased
on
