History of Present Illness:
HPI:
75 y.o. M presents from [**Hospital3 **] intubated, s/p fall from
standing on [**2187-12-6**] 9:00 pm. Fall was not witnessed, and
patient
refused to go to ED immediately post-fall. on [**2187-12-7**] at 3:45
am
he was transported via ambulance to [**Hospital3 **] due to
increase in pain, where he was intubated due to declining
respiratory status. He was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, and trauma
services consulted us at 14:15 pm. Thoracic CT done here shows
severe kyphosis & ankylosing spondylitis with fracture through
T11-12 anterior and middle columns. as well as narrowing of
space
at T11-12 spinal processes.


Past Medical History:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
2. Ankylosing spondylitis
3. Congestive heart failure
4. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
5. Peripheral vascular disease
6. Hypercholesterolemia
7. Obstructive sleep apnea

Pertinent Results:
CT T spine
1) Severe kyphosis & ankylosing spondylitis with fracture
through
T11-12 anterior and middle columns.  In inferoposterior corner
of
T11, T11-12 left facet joint and right T12 pars.  There is
anterior splaying of the T11-12 disc space, with 2.3cm
separation
anteriorl; associated closing of space between
T11-12 spinal processes.
2) Atelectasis.  Interstitial pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural
effusion consistent with CHF. Calcific pleural plaques, likely
related to old asbestos exposure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 3583**].  Pt arrives
intubated.  Pt with CT findings compatible with "bamboo spine"
likely secondary to ankylosing spondylitis with acute fracture
at T11-12. Syndesmophyte disruption along the anterior and
posterior longitudinal ligaments with T11 inferior endplate
fracture and fracture involving both inferior facet joints.
Acute lordotic angulation at T11-12 and marked widening of the
disc space also was noted. Follow up MRI revealed ankylosis of
the cervical and thoracic spine. Fracture through T11-12 disc
with disruption of the anterior and posterior longitudinal
ligaments. Mild trauma to the interspinous region without
definite evidence of disruption of the ligamentum flavum. No
intraspinal hematoma or extrinsic spinal cord compression. No
evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities.  Pt also
noted to have large left-sided pleural effusion on CT of the
chest.  Initially, fall was thought be related to a coronary
event.

Pt was seen by cardiology, but given pt's negative CE, EKG, and
echo, it was felt that the patient did not fit the profile of an
acute ischemic event as the precipitant of his fall.

Pt was brought to the OR with neurosurgery on [**2187-12-9**].  Pt had
Laminectomy T10-L2,  Pedicle screw insertion, segmental, T10-L3,
 Local autograft, Posterolateral arthrodesis T10-L3, and
fracture reduction, open, T10-L3.

In the immediate post op period, the patient was unable to be
weaned from his vent.  Lasix was administered to decrease
pulmonary edema.  Pt was noted to have thick secretions
requiring frequent suctioning.  Repeat chest CT on [**12-13**]
demonstrated a  large simple left pleural effusion with partial
loculation anteromedially, nodular pleural thickening in right
hemithorax, highly suspicious for malignant mesothelioma in the
setting of asbestos-related pleural plaques. Further evaluation
with PET/CT was requested when patient stabilized.    In
addition, Pt had left chest tube placed with one liter of
effusion removed and sent for cytology.  Cytology was negative
for malignant cells.

Urology was briefly consulted for hematuria in setting of
indwelling foley x ~7 days.  They recommended urine cytology, CT
urogram, and follow up in [**3-23**] weeks.

On [**2187-12-21**], pt was brought to OR for trach/PEG/filter.  He has
failed multiple attempts at extubation due to ventilatory
failure and CO2 retention. The patient is
expected to need long-term ventilatory support. The patient also
is not capable of eating and is not expected to be able to eat
normally with the tracheostomy in place for prolonged period. He
is also at high risk for venous thrombo-embolic
disease and has problems with heparinization due to hematuria.
He is therefore considered an appropriate candidate for IVC
filtration.

Patient deemed suitable for vented rehabilatation placement on
[**2187-12-24**].
