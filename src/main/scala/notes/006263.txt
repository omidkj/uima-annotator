Pertinent Results:
[**2133-1-7**] ECHO
Pre-bypass:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. The right atrium is markedly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque
to 40 cm from the incisors. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
myxomatous with posterior leaflet prolapse and partial flail. An
eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2133-1-7**] for surgical
management of his mitral and tricuspid valve disease. He was
taken directly to the Operating Room where he underwent mitral
and tricuspid valve repair. Please see operative note for
details. He weaned from bypass on low dose Epinephrine and Neo
Synephrine and Propofol infusions. Postoperatively he was taken
to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the next several
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated.
Pressors were weaned as he became hypertensive.

On postoperative day one, he was transferred to the step down
unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The Physical Therapy service was consulted
for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. He
developed rate controlled atrial flutter in the 50s and
amiodarone and lopressor were discontinued.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued.  Follow up CXR revealed small
apical pneumothorax on the left.  Coumadin was started for
atrial flutter.  The patient became increasingly bradycardic
into the 40s and EP was consulted.  Anticoagulation was
continued and the patient will be discharged on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts
monitor with plans to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.Arrangements for Coumadin/INR follow up were made
with Dr[**Doctor Last Name **] nurse, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13470**]. POD# 7 Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] cleared
Mr.[**Known lastname **] for discharge to home.
