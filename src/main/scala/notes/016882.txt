Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]M with history of hyperlipidemia with 3 days of chest pain
radiating down the left arm and to the back. Pain always present
but varied in severity.  At its worst pain was [**7-28**]. He denies
associated shortness of breath, palpiations, nausea, vomiting or
diaphoresis.  He states that he initially attributed the pain to
heartburn however as pain persisted he reported to [**Location (un) **] the
day of admission where  EKG showed a STEMI with ST elevations in
leads V1-V4.  He was given ASA, Plavix, Heparin, NTG drip and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  In the ED his NTG was turned off and his
CP returned so it was restarted. He was also continued on a
heparin drip.  Of note patient accidentally got a heparin bolus
x 2.

In the ED he was also noted to have an elevated troponin to
2.79. Cardiology evaluated the patient and decided that given
the infarct likely occurred a few days ago and the age of the
patient the risks of emergent cardiac catherization at this time
outweigh the benefits.  Therefore the patient was admitted to
the CCU for medical management. On arrival to the CCU he denied
Chest pain or shortness of breath.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain as above,
negative for dyspnea on exertion,- paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
-orthopnea, -ankle edema, - syncope or presyncope. Patient does
note occasional palpitations and has an unclear history of
tachycardia in the past but did not experience these symptoms
while having chest pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with a history of HL who presented to an OSH for an
anteriorseptal STEMI likely occurring a few days ago now being
medically managed.

# CAD: Patient is s/p STEMI.  Given his age and age of infarct
emergent cath was not indicated.  Patient was medically managed
with aspirin, plavix and heparin drip.  He was started on
metoprolol, ace inhibitor, and atorvastatin.  He was initially
on a nitroglycerin drip which was weaned on HD1.  Chest pain was
managed with IV morphine as needed.  EKGs were checked daily and
remained stable. He has not had further chest pain in the last
48 hours and has been stable on his current medicines.

# Post-myocardial infarction pericarditis:  On HD1, patient
complained of "indigestion" on the left side of his chest worse
with inspiration and relieved when sitting forward.  On exam,
patient had developed a new rub, consistent with pericarditis.
EKG was unchanged.  Patient's symptoms were managed with IV
morphine as needed, as NSAIDs and steroids were contraindicated
in the post-MI state.  High dose aspirin was considered, but not
given as patient at high risk for GI bleed. Pt was treated
symptomatically with IV morphine.  Rub resolved on HD 2.

# CHF: Per echocardiogram on arrival, patient has mild diastolic
dysfunction and mild systolic dysfunction.  There were no signs
of volume overload on exam. Echo showed moderate to severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF 30%) with mid
to distal septal, anterior and distal LV/apical akinesis.
Warfarin therapy was considered for the apical akinesis but
given advanced age and dual antiplatelet therapy, this was
deferred. Lisinopril was started at 5mg daily and chem-7 will be
checked by VNA on Driday [**8-6**].
.
# Atrial Fibrillation-Pt was noted to be in afib with RVR
throughout the course of his hospitalization beginning on HD 2.
Pt was already anticoagulated on a heparin gtt for his STEMI.
His metoprolol was increased to 25 mg TID and changed to
metoprolol succinate at discharge. Amiodarone load was started,
total of 5800mg. He should decrease dose to 200 mg daily on [**8-9**]
and consider stopping the medicine entirely after 30-40 days as
AF likely related to ischemia. Warfarin deferred as noted above.

.
#Glaucoma: Patient continued home eye drops during admission.

#Transitional issues:
- Patient was DNR/DNI throughout admission
- Will need Chem-7 and CBC on Friday [**8-6**] by VNA with results to
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1258**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 69336**] NP and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8362**].
- Check LFT's at 6 weeks and 3 months with new statin.
- Pt will have VNA and home PT
- Stop amiodarone at 30-40 days and assess for reoccurance of AF
with a holter study.
- Recheck ECHO for systolic function at 30 days.
