Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, PE


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 83 year old female with PMHx sig HTN, HLD, CAD, stage IV
CKD
(HD MWF), COPD, dCHF (EF >55%) with multiple admissions for CHF
exacerbations, and a with recent thrombosis of her left upper
extremity AV [**First Name3 (LF) **] treated with thrombectomy on [**2187-12-21**].
Notably, during her last admission, she had been seen by
cardiology due to hypotension during dialysis, and was started
on midodrine for use during dialysis.  Today, she presents from
dialysis with acute onset chest pain with dyspnea, tachycardia,
and hypotension. She was given a 1100mL bolus and dialysis
stopped prematurely, with a total yield of 2000mL off. She was
given ASA 325mg at dialysis. From the field, she was noted to
have a systolic BP in the 90s and an oxygen saturation in the
80s.
.
On arrival to the ED, her initial vitals were BP 98/62 HR 118,
Sao2: 82% on 4L NC, RR 33. The patient's O2 saturation increased
to 100% on NRB.  She was initially tachycardic with systolic BP
in the 90s, but improvemed after 250cc fluids were given. Her
JVP was noted to be elevated. Her examination was otherwise
notable for moderate TTP throughout her abdomen. A CXR
demonstrated vascular congestion worsened from prior.  Bedside
ultrasound did not show signs of RV strain. A CTPA showed a
subsegmental PE.  She was started on a heparin drip, but since
she had a reduction of tachycardia and her SBP returned to the
100s, thrombolytics were subsequently deferred. Cardiology was
consulted who suggested that the patient is likely preload
dependent with AS, as she improved with IVF. Blood cultures were
taken.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient's vitals were p101 bp 111/57
r 20, Sao2 99% on 4LNC. She states that she feels much more
comfortable than she had been previously, but that she continues
to feel pain in her left shoulder. Reports some continued
dyspnea. No nausea or vomiting.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old female with PMHx sig for HTN, HLD, CAD, stage IV CKD
(HD MWF), COPD, dCHF (EF >55%) with multiple admissions for CHF
exacerbations, and recent thrombosis of her left upper extremity
AV [**Year (4 digits) **], presents with brief episode of hypotension and
dyspnea, and with evidence of appendicitis on CT.
.
# Hypotension:  The patient has previously been noted to be
hypotensive during episodes of dialysis. She now takes midodrine
prior to her dialysis sessions to help guard against this. Her
episode of hypotension after HD was likely related to a relative
hypovolemia and not due to the PE, as there was no evidence of R
heart strain on bedside echo. Her hypotension resolved with
IVFs. She did not show signs of infection and her hypotension
was not felt to be secondary to sepsis.  Patient underwent
another round of dialysis without event.
.
# URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  A UA was sent as part of the
patient's hypotension work up and came back with a large number
of epithelial cells, Urine Cx grew a pan-sensitive Kle
