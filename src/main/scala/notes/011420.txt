Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Flexible Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 53 yo F with a past medical history significant
for HTN, breast ca (s/p XRT, in remission since [**2139**]) who was
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] after presenting to that
hospital with hemoptysis while eating Pringles. The patient
noted 1 tablespoon of bright red blood, and "gurgling in the
chest". She denied SOB or CP, no abdominal pain. OSH
Laryngoscopy showed no bleeding of posterior OP but clots below
vocal cords. She admits to having a history of pleurisy,
possibly associated with her XRT but does not have these
symptoms at this time. She has never had hemoptysis before. On
further questioning, she denies any recent travel,
immobilization, or surgery. No recent TB contact. [**Name (NI) **] PPD was
placed few years ago.
.
In the ED initial vitals were T afebrile BP 147/100 AR 112 RR 16
O2 sat 97% RA. She underwent a CT chest which suggestive of an
infectious or inflammatory process in the left upper lobe. She
was then transferred to the MICU for further monitoring and
bronchoscopy by IP.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo F with history of breast ca and HTN p/w hemoptysis of
unclear etiology.

1) Type II Diabetes:  The patient was diagnosed with diabetes
during this hospitalization.  Her fasting glucose was elevated
on several occasions.  The patient was educated on diabetic diet
and given information on the disease.  She was also provided
with a prescription for Metformin to be started after discharge
once the dye from her radiologic study had cleared from her
kidneys.  She was also set up with an appointment for diabetes
nurse education at [**Hospital3 **].

2) Hemoptysis: The original differential included bronchitis,
bronchogenic carcinoma, and bronchiectasis as the most common
etiologies. She had no evidence of bronchiectasis on imaging.
Other possibilities include foreign body/airway trauma,
infection (TB, pneumonia, lung abscess), immune
disorders/vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis, Goodpasture's
syndrome, but the patient is a bit old for these initial
diagnoses). Other possibilities include PE, but would expect
some hypoxia, shortness of breath and even hemodynamic
instability if PE was severe enough to cause hemoptysis, or AVM.
The chest CT is suspicious for infection, however focal alveolar
hemorrhage cannot be ruled out. She denies any history of TB
exposure. Malignancy is also a possibility given history of
breast cancer. She was admitted to the ICU where she underwent a
bronchoscopy which showed a blood clot in the left upper lobe
that could not be dislodged. Other area of the lung appeared
normal. She was started on levofloxacin for a 5 day course. She
was then called out of the MICU to the medical floors as she
remained hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit. A
repeat bronchoscopy the following day revealed a dislodged clot
with abnormal appearing airways in the LUL suspicious for either
an inflammatory or possibly malignant process. A endobronchial
biopsy was performed as well as a BAL, brushings, and washings.
She also had an ANCA and anti-GBM checked while in the hospital
that were pending at the time of discharge. She was discharged
with a 5 day course of levoquin and will have the results of her
biopsy and BAL followed up on within 1 week. She will follow-up
with IP in clinic within 1 month for a repeat CT chest and
repeat flex bronch.

3) Hypertension: The patient was continued on her outpatient
regimen of Diovan.  She will likely need uptitration of her
blood pressure medications as an outpatient for improved blood
pressure control.

4) Depression: The patient was continued on Effexor 150 mg PO
QAM and 75 mg PO QPM while in the hospital.

5) h/o Breast Ca: Patient states that she is in remission.
Question whether she has lung metastases which could cause
hemoptysis. Based on CT scan it is unlikely but should still be
part of differential

Primary:
Hemoptysis
DM type 2

HTN


Discharge Condition:
Vitals stable, NAD


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after several episodes of
coughing up blood.  You had a bronchoscopy which initially
showed a blood clot and a repeat bronchoscopy that showed
slightly abnormal lining of the airway which was biopsied.  This
may just be a reflection of some inflammation, and you will need
to have your biopsy results followed up. We will contact you in
regards to the results within 1 week.

You were treated with an antiobiotic called levofloxacin for a
possible bronchitis or other lung infection while in the
hospital. You will take the antibiotics for a total of 5 days,
and have 2 more days remaining in your course.

While you were in the hospital, you were diagnosed with Type II
Diabetes.  We are starting you on a new medication named
Metformin.  Please start this medication Thursday, [**2148-5-30**].


Please check your fingerstick one time a day and record the
value.  Please bring this with you when you see both your
primary care physician and the diabetes nurse educator.

If you experience any further bleeding or bright red blood after
coughing, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or any other
concerning symptoms, please call your PCP or go to the emergency
room.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 20585**]
