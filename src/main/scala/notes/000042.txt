Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-28**] for
pre-operative evaluation. She was started on IV heparin for her
coronary disease.  She was taken to the operating room on [**12-2**]
and was induced with general anesthesia.  It was then noted that
she had purulent drainage from her lower extremeties in the area
of the venous stasis.  The surgery was canceled and she was
transferred to the ICU to allow to awaken and she was started on
antibiotics.  A vascular surgery and infectious disease consult
was obtained and patient underwent ultrasound studies of her LE
which did not show any significant reflux and no arterial
occlusion.  With the antibiotics, the erythema and drainage
improved and with continued Lasix the edema improved and patient
was taken to the operating room on [**12-7**] for a redo sternotomy,
CABGx1-SVG-PDA, and AVR with a 21 mm pericardial valve.  The
patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.  She was
weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on [**12-7**]
without difficulty.  She had episodes of nausea and was started
on Reglan and an antiemetic with some relief.  Her chest tubes
and pacing wires were removed without incident.  She was started
on lo dose Lopressor which she tolerated well, and had
escalating doses of Lasix to achieve adequate diuresis.  She was
transferred from the ICU to the regular floor on POD#5.  In the
early morning of POD 6, she developed atrial fibrillation which
was rate controlled.  She had some thrombocytopenia
postoperatively and a heparin antibody test was found to be
positive.  A hematology consult was obtained and it was
recommended that she be started on argatroban for
anticoagulation.  This was started as well as Coumadin and the
argatroban was turned off when her INR became therapeutic.  She
underwent an ultrasound of her R arm due to swelling which did
not show any venous clot or obstruction. During her
postoperative course, she continued to be nauseaus, a KUB showed
a lot of stool and she had an aggressive bowel regime.  During
this time, her PO intake was poor.  A GI consult was obtained
and it was recommended to continue the current therapy and by
POD#13 the nausea was improving.  On POD#12 it was noted that
she was having some periods of bradycardia with the atrial
fibrillation and it was decided to discontinue the Lopressor,
after which there were no further pauses.
