HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year old
male transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] to [**Hospital1 346**] for permanent pacemaker placement.
The patient presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] with three days of
shortness of breath, pedal edema on [**2131-3-25**], and on
electrocardiogram there, the patient was found to be in
complete heart block with escape rhythm in the 30s.  The
patient was also in congestive heart failure.  He has chronic
renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
approximately 2.3.  Last night electrocardiogram showed
normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute, first degree AV
block, right bundle branch block, left axis deviation.
Temporary pacemaker wires were placed on [**2131-3-25**], with 70%
capture noted as per discharge summary.  The patient was
noted to have four beat run of ventricular tachycardia prior
to wire placement as well.  Given both pacing needs and
history of ventricular tachycardia, the patient was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
pacer defibrillator placement.  Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 346**], it was noted that the patient's
pacer was capturing only 30% of the time at bedside.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3321**] was called urgently for bedside wire evaluation with
fluoroscopy.  It was noted that the wires were noted to be in
the right ventricular outflow tract and they were
repositioned in the right ventricular apex. The patient was
stable and capturing with threshold of 1.5 mV of current.

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11679**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 70 beats per minute paced,
blood pressure 102/60, oxygen saturation 98%, respiratory
rate 23,  Moist mucous membranes.  Jugular venous pressure
elevated to 10.  The pacing wires were in place.  Lungs -
Expiratory wheezes with poor air flow.  Heart - regular rate
and rhythm, S1 and S2.  The abdomen was soft and nontender.
Extremities - +1 lower extremity edema bilaterally.
Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented times
three.

LABORATORY DATA:  On presentation, Digoxin level was 2.13.
Hematocrit was 39.7.  White blood cell count 5.2, platelet
count 195,000.  Creatinine 2.2, blood urea nitrogen 83.
Sodium 138, chloride 93, bicarbonate 27, potassium 4.0,
magnesium 2.6, CK 124, troponin 0.061.

Electrocardiogram showed bigeminy.  Old electrocardiogram
from [**Hospital3 3583**], complete heart block, right bundle
branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 73 year old male with
complete heart block and history of ventricular tachycardia
transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] with temporary pacing wires
for permanent pacemaker/possible AICD placement.  On the
night of admission the patien developed progressive respiratory
distress due to pulmonary edema, and was intubated and sedated.
Chest x-ray confirmed pulmonary edema.  Right heart
catheterization showed cardiac output of 5.1 and cardiac index of
2.75.  The patient had initially been started on Dopamine and
Neo-Synephrine for hypotension status post the intubation. Pacing
wire remained functional in the 70s.  On [**2131-3-27**], the Dopamine
was weaned off.  On [**2131-3-28**], Neo-Synephrine was weaned off. The
patient went to the Electrophysiology Laboratory and had a
biventricular permanent pacemaker placed with no complications.
Discussions had been made with the patient (prior to
intubation) and the family regarding the possible placement of
an ICD. Both the patient and family felt that this was not
compatible with the patient's wishes.  On [**2131-3-29**], the patient
was weaned from the ventilator successfully being alert and in
good spirits.  He had been placed on a Lasix drip prior to being
extubated with a diuresis of 3.5 liters.  During this period, the
patient also had an echocardiogram on [**2131-3-27**].  The patient was
found to have a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%, TR
gradient of 45, left atrium elongated, right atrium was mildly
dilated. Catheter pacing wire was seen in the right ventricle
and/or right atrium, left ventricle wall thickness normal, cavity
was mildly dilated, several global left ventricular
hypokinesis, no mass or thrombi seen in the left ventricle,
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated, right ventricular
systolic function appeared depressed, [**12-7**]+ mitral
regurgitation, moderate 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient is a 73 year old male who presents with an
ejection fraction of 20%, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, with complete heart block, status post permanent
pacemaker, also history of ventricular tachycardia, but the
patient's family wanted him to be do not [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not
resuscitate.  As a result, he did not have an AICD placed.

Rhythm - Complete heart block - He is status post permanent
pacemaker placement with no events.  The patient has a
follow-up appointment on [**2131-4-5**], at 10:30 a.m. at Device
Clinic, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 33449**].  The patient was noted to have brief
episodes of atrial fibrillation, however the decision was made
not to initiate coumadin at this time due to risk of falling
and anemia and the relatively short periods of time that the
patient has been in atrial fibrillation.  This will be
readdressed in the future.

Coronary artery disease - Aspirin, statin, low dose Zestril
for congestive heart failure.  The patient was on 0.125 mg
Digoxin once daily.  The patient should have a Digoxin level
checked on Monday, [**2131-4-2**].  The patient will be discharged
on a dose of Lasix p.o.  If the patient should have any
weight gain, his primary care physician should be [**Name (NI) 653**].
The patient should be followed up and have his Coreg started
as an outpatient in the outpatient cardiology setting if his
blood pressure tolerates it for his heart failure.

Pulmonary - The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and has received Atrovent nebulizers here and is on
Singulair as well and uses a Combivent inhaler.

Renal - The patient's creatinine was 1.3 on the day of
discharge.  It seemed to be relatively stable throughout his
stay.  He actually presented with a higher creatinine of 2.2
at the time of admission.

Infectious disease - The patient received Vancomycin
peripacemaker wire adjustment and pacemaker placement.  He
then will be on Keflex for seven days postprocedure until
[**2131-4-5**].
