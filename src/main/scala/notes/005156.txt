History of Present Illness:
This is an 87-year-old woman with an extensive PMH including CAD
3 vessel, HTN, CHF, mod-severe AS who presented with acute
respiratory distress requiring intubation.  Ms. [**Known lastname 4602**]
developed increasing dyspnea at home since yesterday with
elevated blood pressure last evening (SBP > 200).  No history of
fever, chills, cough, increased sputum or chest pain.  Her
daughter found her this morning in acute respiratory distress
and consequently called EMS.  At the time she was ambulating to

Cardiac Echo [**2172-3-9**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-7-16**], the
severity of aortic stenosis has progressed.
.
CXR [**2172-3-11**]
Lung volumes are maintained following tracheal extubation.
Extensive
bilateral pulmonary consolidation is heterogeneous and also has
varied in
radiodensity to different degrees in separate areas over the
past two days. I suspect much of the abnormality is edema, but
pulmonary hemorrhage and pneumonia could be making a
contribution. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable and small
bilateral pleural effusions have developed since the earliest
studies on [**3-9**]. Transvenous right atrial and right
ventricular pacer leads in standard placements. No pneumothorax.

.
EKG [**2172-3-12**]:
A-V sequentially paced rhythm with intrinsic A-V conduction and
right
bundle-branch block configuration. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2172-3-9**] there is no diagnostic interim change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4602**] is a pleasant 87-year-old woman with CAD, CHF,
HTN, sick sinus syndrome s/p pacer, moderate-severe AS who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2172-3-9**] with acute respiratory distress.
Due to her poor respiratory status she was intubated in the
emergency department and admitted to the medical intensive care
unit. On [**2172-3-10**], her respiratory status had improved and she was
successfully extubated. On [**2172-3-11**], she was transferred to the
cardiology service. Her brief hospital course was notable for:
.
# ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS:  Acute pulmonary edema was
suspected as the most likely etiology of the patient's acute
respiratory distress, in setting of diastolic dysfunction and
moderate-severe AS.  Initially, there was concern for myocardial
infarction however, she was ultimately ruled out with three sets
of negative cardiac enzymes. There was also concern for
pneumonia and initially Ms. [**Known lastname 4602**] was put on antibiotics.
However, due to lack of fever, leukocytosis, and marked clinical
improvement, antibiotics were discontinued on [**2172-3-11**].  In the
MICU, Ms. [**Known lastname 4602**] was diuresed with 60 IV lasix x 1, and on
[**2172-3-11**] was restarted on her home regimen of 80 mg PO lasix. An
arterial line was placed on [**2172-3-9**] without incident, for close
BP observation, and this was discontinued on [**2172-3-11**], prior to
transfer to the floor. She was successfully extubated on [**2172-3-11**].
.
Upon arrival on medicine floor, Ms. [**Known lastname 4602**] was started on
Torsemide (eventually uptitrated to 40mg [**Hospital1 **]) with good urine
output and diminishment of rales on lung exam.  (Patient was
diuresed with caution in light of mod-severe AS).  SP02
continued to be 92-95% on 2L nasal cannula.  She was also
started on Lisinopril 20mg QD for better BP control and
afterload reduction.  Better BP control will help with pulmonary
edema, but without valvular repair, this issue cannot be
entirely corrected.  Both the family and the patient are aware
of this.
.
# HYPERTENSION: During her hospitalization, the patient was
noted to have labile blood pressures ranging from hypo to
hypertensive. Hypotensive episodes occured in the setting of
getting propofol for sedation while intubated, and hypertensive
episodes occured primarily in the settings of anxiety, and after
extubation.
