Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
ascites and LE edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2123-10-5**]  MV repair/TV repair/ right atrial thrombectomy with RAA
ligation (28 mm [**Company 1543**] CG Future Mitral ring/ 34 mm CE MC3
tricuspid ring)

History of Present Illness:
62 yo female initially seen in early [**Month (only) 216**] for evaluation of
MR/TR in the setting of LE edema and ascites. Echo in [**2123-6-25**]
revealed 4+ MR, 3+ TR, 1+ AI, and dilated main PA and RA.
Referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] for surgery. This was delayed pending
preoperative workup as well as the pt's concerns regarding
probable need for blood transfusions.Preop workup complete
during an admission in late [**Month (only) 216**] that included cath, PICC
placement for IV access,as well as treatment for a UTI. Her INR
did not ever completely normalize given continuing hepatic
issues. PICC was removed prior to this admission. Returns now
for surgery.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2123-9-23**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. Normal
IVC diameter (1.5-2.5cm) with <50% decrease during respiration
(estimated RAP 11-15mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). [Intrinsic LV
systolic function likely depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Normal RV
systolic function. [Intrinsic RV systolic function likely more
depressed given the severity of TR]. Abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with RV volume overload.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Eccentric
MR jet. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Tricuspid leaflets do not fully coapt. Severe [4+] TR. Normal PA
systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Ascites.
Conclusions
The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%) [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of mitral regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size is moderately increased with normal free wall motion.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There
is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with
right ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened and fail to fully coapt. Severe
[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-9-23**],
the findings are similar (TR was also severe on the prior
study).

RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2123-10-23**] 7:25 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: placement of dophoff tube confirmation

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old woman s/p MV repair/TV repair now s/p tracheostomy
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
placement of dophoff tube confirmation
HISTORY: Dobbhoff tube placement.

Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates no change
in the support lines when compared with [**2123-10-21**]. Right-sided
pleural effusion persists and is unchanged. There may be slight
interval improvement in the previously seen left-sided pleural
effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis persists. No pneumothorax is
identified. Trachea is midline. Cardiomediastinal contours are
unchanged.

IMPRESSION:

Slight interval improvement in left-sided pleural effusion,
otherwise no change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**10-4**] and underwent surgery on [**10-5**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**].
Please refer to the operative note for details. Transferred to
the CVICU on epinephrine, propofol and nitroglycerin drips.
Epinephrine weaned off due to VTach. Extubated that night, but
reintubated the following afternoon for increasing acidosis and
mental status changes. Renal consult also done for decreasing
urine output.Echo also done with no significant findings. EP
