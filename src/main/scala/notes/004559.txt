Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4963**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
74 yoM w/ a PMHx significant for CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM,
alzheimer's dementia, ischemic systolic CHF (EF 40%) presented
s/p syncopal events presenting after a recent syncopal event on
[**9-18**] in which he suffered head trauma and subdural and
subarachnoid hemorrhages, with no subsequent neurosurgical
intervention and resolving hemorrhages by CT.  He has an altered
mental status from his baseline per his family (worse confusion)
however per staff has been improving over the past 3 days in his
ability to interact.  Syncopal event is thought to be due to
sinus pauses up to 5 seconds (noted in trauma ICU) for which a
pacemaker has been planned.  Has recently developed fevers
thought to be due to pneumonia/aspiration pneumonia vs
pneumonitis seen on CXR.  Given his current infection his
pacemaker plcmnt has been postponed and he has been transferred
to the medicine service.

CXR PA / Lat: [**2190-9-22**]: Bibasilar consolidation, right greater
than left, which may be due to aspiration or evolving aspiration
pneumonia.

Head CT [**2190-9-23**]: Stable subdural heterogeneous hemorrhages
bilaterally.  Slight decrease in the largest of the
intraparenchymal hemorrhages as described above with surrounding
edema.  Evolution of the bilateral subarachnoid blood.

Head CT [**2190-10-1**]: Continued evolution of bilateral subdural,
subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages.  No new
hemorrhage is visualized.

EKG [**2190-9-18**]: sinus bradycardia, rate 52, nl axis, 1st degree AV
block, LAE

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW:  This exam was performed in
conjunction with the speech pathologist.  Various consistencies
of barium were administered.  The oral and pharyngeal phases
were normal with good epiglottic deflection and laryngeal valve
closure.  There was no residue in the valleculae or piriform
sinuses.  There was no penetration or aspiration with any
consistency.
IMPRESSION:  Normal swallow study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Sudural hematoma- due to syncope likely related to sinus pauses
of up to 5 seconds found on telemetry.  Patient has had multiple
falls in the past, unfortunately the most recent fall led to SDH
and SAH.  These have been stable over time on repeat CT scans
and per neurosurgery he is okay to start anti-platelet agents
and subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  His mental status
is stable and he is AOx0, occasionally he is able to state his
first name if provided with his last name.  He is interactive
and does follow commands but is unable to hold a appropriate or
intelligent conversation.  His SDH / SAH must be followed by
neurosurgery at the appointment that has been made for him.  At
this time he will also have a repeat head CT scan.  He is on
dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and must have his levels
checked once per week, his discharge dilantin level was 11.7
([**9-28**]), and an albumin of 3.5.  Goal dilantin level is [**10-16**].
He has been restarted on plavix for his drug eluting stents and
aspirin has currently been held.  This can be restarted per
neurosurgery upon discharge however we held it as we hoped to
introduce the anti-platelet agents singly rather than together.


Sinus Pauses- Patient had sinus pauses 3-5 seconds while
monitored on telemetry in the trauma ICU. He was evaluated by EP
cardiology as an inpatient and they thought given his sinus
pauses of up to 5 seconds he would need to have a pacemaker for
the indication of symptomatic sick sinus syndrome.  The initial
plan was to have this pacer placed inpatient however the patient
became febrile likely due to aspiration pneumonia.  He was on IV
antibiotics for this and pacer placement was deferred until
outpatient.  He should have this pacer placed before returning
home and should be considered a fall risk at least until
placement of pacer. Of note, while on the medicine service, the
patient did not have prolonged pauses on telemetry.  The rehab
should coordinate his pacer placement to be timed appropriately-
Prior to discharging the patient to his home or long term living
facility.  He has a follow up appointment with his outpatient
cardiologist to help coordinate this.

Aspiration Pneumonia- febrile with signs of aspiration
pneumonia.  Treated with Unasyn, last dose on of [**2190-9-30**] for a
total 8 day course.  Seen by ID inpatient for antibiotic choice.
 Afebrile for at least 96 hours pre discharge and blood cultures
were negative. video swallow study revealed normal swallowing so
patient was discharged on a normal consistency diet.

DM- relatively well controlled as inpatient, see discharge
regimen and adjust accordingly.
