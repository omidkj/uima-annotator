[**2157-9-5**] Carotid Duplex U/S
Mild atherosclerotic changes bilaterally with less than 40%
stenosis of the internal carotid arteries on both sides. This is
a baseline examination at the [**Hospital1 18**].

[**2157-9-3**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. Tissue velocity imaging
E/e' is
elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling
pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include thinned and aneurysmal basal inferior/inferolateral
wall, mid inferior
hypokinesis/akinesis, akinetic mid to distal septum, and apical

akinesis/hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior
pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.

[**2157-9-15**] ECHO
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
3. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
5. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet
motion and transvalvular gradients.
6. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-9-6**],
the mitral prosthetic valve is new.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2157-9-2**] for further
management of his coronary artery disease. He was worked-up in
the usual preoperative manner by the cardiac surgical service.
Heparin was continued for anticoagulation. A carotid duplex
ultrasound was performed which showed mild atherosclerotic
changes bilaterally with less than 40% stenosis of the internal
carotid arteries bilaterally. An echocardiogram was performed
which showed his ejection fraction to be 25%, no mitral valve
regurgitation and an inferior basal aneurysm. The cardiology
service was consulted for assistance with the management of his
ischemic [**Date Range **]. Carvedilol, aspirin, ace inhibition and
statin therapy were started. As Mr. [**Known lastname 16643**] hematocrit fell, a
cause of his anemia was explored. A tagged red blood cell scan
was negative for an active bleed. The gastrointestinal service
was consulted. A colonoscopy was notable for only diverticula
and hemorrhoids. An esophageal duodenoscopy was notable for
angioectasia which was cauterized and gastritis. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
subsequently cleared for surgery. On [**2157-9-6**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to four vessels and a mitral valve replacement
using a 31mm mosaic porcine valve. Please see operative note for
details. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed for poor
hemodynamics. An initial attempt was made to place the balloon
in the left groin which failed. The left groin thus needed to be
explored with repairs made to the femoral artery. The balloon
was then placed in the right groin. Postoperatively he was taken
to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. He
required multiple pressors and blood products for postoperative
bleeding. Amiodarone was started for ectopy. Over the next
several days, Mr. [**Known lastname **] slowly weaned from pressors, the
balloon pump and sedation. On [**2157-9-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
successfully extubated. He developed atrial fibrillation which
was treated with amiodarone and beta blockade. He initially had
some confusion however cleared appropriately. He was gently
diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative
strength and mobility. On postoperative day seven, Mr. [**Known lastname **]
was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He
remained in normal sinus rhythm. A repeat echocardiogram showed
his ejection fraction to be 20%. Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to make
steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative day
ten. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**], his cardiologist and
his primary care physician as an outpatient.
