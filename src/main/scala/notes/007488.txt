Pertinent Results:
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2156-6-30**] 12:48 AM
1) Multiple, bilateral, ill defined, peripheral pulmonary
nodules, some of which appear to cavitating. Findings are most
consistent with septic emboli. If the patient is
immunocompromised, fungal infection is also considered. The
radiographic differential also includes vasculitis.
2) Right middle lobe bronchiectasis with patchy opacity present,
which may represent atelectasis and/or infection.
------------
ECHO Study Date of [**2156-6-30**]
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal
(LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 5.The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.

   WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2156-7-2**]):
      ENTEROBACTER AEROGENES.    >15 colonies.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

Brief Hospital Course:
49M with Crohn's disease/short gut, TPN-dependent here with
sepsis likely due to portacath infection.

Given hypotension on presentation, patient was initially
admitted to intensive care unit and pressor support continued.
Indwelling line (portacath) was removed on hospital day one in
the operating room due to high suspicion of line infection.
Catheter tip culture revealed Enterobacter aerogenes in addition
to Escherichia coli and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] cultured from blood two days
prior to admission.  Nonetheless, following continued antibiotic
therapy and removal of infected line, patient's blood pressure
and fevers improved, and patient was weaned of pressors at the
end of hospital day one.

On hospital day two, patient was felt to be stable for transfer
to floor, and TPN was reinitiated through central line.
Surveillance blood cultures were drawn on hospital day three
prior to placement of a new peripheral intravenous central
catheter as patient had been afebrile for 48 hours at that
point.  Patient's antibiotic regimen was tailored to
levofloxacin alone as both gram negative rods were sensitive to
this antibiotic.  Patient was initiated on fluconazole for
treatment of candidemia.

Patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable and afebrile
and was discharged on hospital day four.  Patient was instructed
to continue antibiotics for a full course, and to follow up with
primary care physician within two weeks of discharge.
