shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
hpi:86 yo female with non-ischemic CM, EF 10-20%, severe MR,
asthma who was admitted [**8-20**] with right facial droop. CT and MRI
negative for CVA. On hospital day#2 developed acute onset soba
dn increased rr and hr. Lasix had been held in the am due to low
bp. Denied CP, though was not mentating well and unable to
answer questions reliably. Stat cxr showed worsening chf. ABG
showed 7.25/46/235 on nrb. Pt received 80 and then 40 mg IV
lasix with no response. 1 mg IV morphine given. EKG showed ST
with baseline LBBB. Pt transferred to CCU for presumed CHF
exacerbation.

86 yo F with EF 10-20%, 4+ MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] to the CCU with acute
tachy/hypoxia.

1) Respiratory distress--Ddx: CHF +/- aspiration PNA. By CXR,
history, CHF likely a component. However, pt showed no response
to another lasix 120 mg IV as well as lasix drip. Also, per
nursing staff, pt had not been mentating well and had had
difficulty taking PO and may have aspirated. O/N pt developed a
fever over empiric levo/flagyl. Though the pt satted well and
had improved abg's on NRB and then high flow mask, the
underlying pathophysiology--her CHF and likely pna--did not
appear improved.
2) Poor cardiac output--The has had a hx of declining mentation
over the past few weeks that has fallen precipitously leading to
this admit. Also, during this admit, the pt's Cr has elevated
significantly and her urine output has fallen. This is likely
due to worsening cardiac out-put. It is unclear what the
precipitating event was that led to the acute decompensation of
her cardiac output. O/N her CO was unresponsive to dobutamine
and her BP was worsening by its effects.
3) Low [**Name (NI) 49810**] pt's BP worsening with the dobutamine. During the
administration of the dopamine, she was found to have a temp to
103. The pt's BP did not recover despite the dobutamine being
stopped and levophed being administered and escalated to the
maximum dose. The pt was felt to be septic.
4) Code status: [**Name (NI) 49811**] pt's cardiogenic shock exacerbated by
an apparent underlying septic shock was discussed with the
family. The pt's family had been updated as to Ms. [**Known lastname 49812**]
condition throughout the night. With no improvement in pt's MAPs
despite escalating doses of levophed, the felt including son
(hcp) felt goals of care should be to make pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: The pt is an 86 yo F with EF 10-20%, 4+ MR transferred to
the CCU with acute tachycardia/hypoxia.

1) Respiratory distress??????On admission the pt??????s differential
diagnosis was: CHF +/- aspiration PNA. By CXR, and the patient??????s
history, CHF was a likely a component to her presentation.
However, the pt showed no response to a bolus of lasix IV as
well as lasix drip. Also, per nursing staff, the pt had not been
mentating well and had had difficulty taking PO and may have
aspirated. O/N pt developed a fever over empiric levo/flagyl.
Though the pt satted well and had improved abg's on NRB, then
high flow mask, the underlying pathophysiology--her CHF and low
cardiac output as well as her likely pna--did not appear
improved.  By [**2165-8-21**] the pt had made little urine out-put and ,
thus, appeared to remain volume overloaded pulmonary-wise. Per
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the cardiology fellow, low dose peripheral
dobutamine was atarted in hopes of improving cardiac output.
However, the urine output remained low and the pt??????s BP dropped
to around 60/30. The pt??????s temp spiked as well to around 103 F.
Thus, the picture was complicated by sepsis.

2) Poor cardiac output??????Before admission the pt had a hx of
declining mentation over the past few weeks that has fallen
precipitously leading to this admit. Also, during this admit,
the pt's Cr has elevated significantly and her urine output has
fallen. This was likely due to worsening cardiac out-put. It is
unclear what the precipitating event was that led to the acute
decompensation of her cardiac output. On [**8-21**] her CO was
unresponsive to dobutamine and her BP was worsening by its
effects. This likely led to the pulmonary effects described
above.

3) Low [**Name (NI) 49810**] pt's BP worsened with the dobutamine. During the
administration of the dopamine, she was found to have a temp to
103. The pt's BP did not recover despite the dobutamine being
stopped and levophed being administered and escalated to the
maximum dose. Eventually  levophed was added with minimal
effect. The pt was deemed to be septic.

4) Code status: [**Name (NI) 49811**] pt's cardiogenic shock exacerbated by
an apparent underlying septic shock was discussed with the
family. The pt's family was updated as to her condition
throughout her admission. With no improvement in the pt's MAPs
despite escalating doses of levophed, the pt??????s son, Dr. [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) **] (hcp) felt the goals of care should be to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].
 Eventually, the patient died on [**2165-8-22**] and was declared dead
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2808**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1726**].
