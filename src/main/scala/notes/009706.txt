was found to be 0.25%.  A head CT showed subdural, subarachnoid,
and intraparenchymal hemorrhage. She was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**]
where a repeat head CT showed the same, and she was ultimately
intubated for airway protection in the emergency room.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with subdural hematoma, subarachnoid
hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrage.  A repeat CT scan
demonstrated an increase in the intraparenchymal bleed. She was
admitted to the ICU for close observation and neuro checks.  She
required a neosynephrine drip to keep her MAPs > 60.  She was
started on mannitol.  She was given DDAVP for presumed platelet
dysfunction.  She then had refractory hypertension, which
required hydralazine and labetolol to control.  Dilantin was
started.  On [**12-27**], she was started on tube feeds.  Repeat head
CT on [**12-27**] was stable.  An additional head CT on [**12-28**] was
stable.  On [**12-29**], a head CT was again stable.  Pt was started on
levofloxacin for sinusitis.  She also developed a UTI and
presumed pneumonia, for which levofloxacin was indicated.  On
[**12-30**], pt had blood loss anemia and required 2uPRBCs.  Mannitol
was discontinued.  An attempt was made to extubate the patient,
but it failed.  Although she had been opening her eyes on
admission and had been somewhat responsive, she began being
unresponsive about 2 days into her admission.  On [**12-31**], she was
seen by neurology, who believed she may be suffering from
sympathetic storm, as she was having intermittent posturing and
tremor.  They suggested getting an EEG which suggested a
widespread encephalopathy.  No cause for this encephalopathy was
found.  They also suggested starting clonidine for the presumed
sympathetic storm, and this was thus begun.  A head CT was done
on [**1-4**] which showed resolving hemorrhage.  On [**1-5**], the patient
got a tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy tube.  She began
to experience some dyspnea and tachypnea, so she underwent a CT
angio to rule out pulmonary embolism on [**2134-1-8**] as well as lower
extremity ultrasound, and both were negative for DVT and PE.  On
[**1-10**], she had a bronchoscopy which did not show any significant
plugging.  Her respiratory status improved with nebs, and at the
time of discharge her respiratory status was okay with a trach
mask at 50%.  Her exam slightly improved during her hospital
stay in that she moved all four extremities, but she still did
not follow commands.  She was started on tube feeding and is
tolerating well.  The patient started to develop some distention
of her abdomen, and there was a question of free air under the
diaphragm, but this was discussed with the radiologist and felt
to represent curvilinear atelectasis above the diaphragm.  She
was treated with flagyl for presumtive c-difficile, but this was
found to be negative.  Hematology saw her in consultation for
thrombocytosis and felt it was reactive, given her CRP and ESR
were elevated, rather than essential thrombocytosis (she had a
normal platelet count upon admission).  The only treatment they
recommended was aspirin, and periodically checking platelet
counts.
