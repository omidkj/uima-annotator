History of Present Illness:
86 yo RHM who presented initially to
[**Hospital1 2436**] this morning on [**2171-11-14**] after he awoke and had
visual
changes and a headache. He states that when he awoke he looked
at
his alarm clock and felt that he could not read the numbers. He
usually has dry eyes in the morning and thought it may have been
related to this, but then he used some drops and still could not
see them. He said he saw the images, but could not interpret
them. He also described that he was having a headache mostly on
the right side of his head. This he described as a tightness
over
the temporal aspect of his head. He became worried at this time
and called 911. He was transported to [**Hospital3 **] and a
noncontrast CT revealed a right parieto-occipital hemorrhage and
he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive care.

Radiology:
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2171-11-14**] 7:53 PM
FINDINGS: There is an extensive right parieto-occipitotemporal
hematoma, measuring 26 x 93 mm in its largest axial diameter.
The hematoma displays fluid-fluid level, is hypointense on T1
and heterogeneously hyperintense on T2, suggesting hyperacute
state with the signal predominantly related to oxyhemoglobin. A
rim of high signal on diffusion imaging along the medial aspect
of the medial aspect of the hematoma may be related to blood
products or indicate underlying infarction. Thus, this might be
a hemorrhagic infarction.

There is significant perilesional edema and mass effect on the
right atrium with CSF trapping in the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Faint linear enhancement within and along the margins of the
hemorrhage is likely vascular in nature; there
