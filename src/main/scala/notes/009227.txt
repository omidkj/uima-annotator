Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization ([**2112-1-24**])

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year-old woman with a history of refractory
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, former tobacco abuse, h/o ovarian
cancer, s/p Left AKA who presents for evaluation of chest pain.
The chest pain occurred after exertion, walking down stairs and
to car after a birthday party at 9:15pm. It was substernal,
nonradiating, [**7-18**] in severity heaviness, associated with nausea
and vomiting, lightheadedness and SOB. It lasted approximately
1-2 hours and has been intermittent since last night. Symptoms
worsened with minimal exertion. She denies h/o PND, orthopnea,
DOE, weight gain, syncope, presyncope, or palpitations. Symptoms
improved with nitro gtt and NTG SL. She had similar pain
previously in [**2090**] when diagnosed with iron deficiency. Denies
h/o CAD and reports she had normal echo and stress test at that
time.

At OSH, she had CTA that was negative for dissection, but showed
penetrating ulcers in thrombus of descending aorta, also
hypodenisties/hyperdensities in both kidneys. She was started on
heparin gtt, nitro gtt for elevated BP 200/100. She was given
Zofran, Lopressor, morphine 4 mg x 2, Reglan 10 ,g IV, NS bolus
1 liter. Given elevated troponin (although values are not in
chart/record), she was transferred for catheterization and
further management.

In the ED, initial vitals were HR 75 BP 125/85 RR 16 O2Sat 99%
on 3 L/min NC. Patient received [**Year (4 digits) **] 600 mg, Zofran, Lasix 20
mg IV, continued on heparin gtt and nitro gtt and was admitted
for further evaluation and management.

On arrival to floor, she reported [**12-19**] substernal chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. Denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems is notable for
absence of ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Hypercholesterolemia
s/p ovarian CA and TAH-BSO [**2096**]
s/p Left AKA [**2096**] for chemorelated blood clot, decreased
circulation?

CAD Risk Factors: -Diabetes, +Dyslipidemia, +Hypertension

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. Patient quit smoking in [**2103**] after ~55 pack years. There is
no history of alcohol abuse.

or sudden death. Mother with MI in her 80s.

[**2112-1-24**] ECG
Sinus rhythm at 76 bpm. Prominent limb lead QRS voltages
suggests left ventricular hypertrophy delayed R wave progression
raises the consideration of prior anterior myocardial infarction
Modest low amplitude precordial lead/anterior T wave changes are
nonspecific

[**2112-1-24**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed two vessel disease. The LMCA had mild disease. The LAD
had slow flow and was ectactic. A diagonal artery had an 80%
stenosis at the origin. The LCX system had a small occluded
obtuse marginal artery but otherwise no angiographically
apparent flow limiting disease. The RCA was ectatic with no
angiographically apparent flow limiting disease.
2. Abdominal aortic and renal artery angiography revealed severe
aortic tortuosity, and the left renal artery was ulcerated with
aneurysmal outpouchings and 80-90% stenosis. There was a small
accessory left renal artery. The right renal artery was without
angiographically apparent flow limiting disease.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated severely elevated
left sided filling pressures with LVEDP 35 mm Hg. The systemic
pressure was elevated with central aortic pressure 174/95 mm Hg.
Careful pullback across the aortic valve demonstrated no
significant gradient.

[**2112-1-24**] CXR:
There are no old films available for comparison. The heart is
upper limits of normal in size. The aorta is tortuous. There are
increased interstitial markings bilaterally with bilateral
pleural effusions vs. pleural thickening. It is unclear how much
of this appearance is due to chronic lung disease. There may be
some superimposed CHF and an underlying infectious infiltrate
cannot be totally excluded.
