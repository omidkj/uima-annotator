History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient unable to give good history on his own; hx per
daughter.
Daughter found pt. when she returned home in evening [**8-20**] lying
on the ground, awake; lying there approx. 4 hrs per pt report.
Pt states he had "passed out" and couldn't rise.  Positive
mental status changes at the time and was not able to answer his
daughter's questions appropriately. He had not been incontinent
of stool or urine. She called her mother and the ambulance and
the patient was then brought in to the ED.
.
The daughter says the patient had not been feeling well the
previous day. He was complaining of not feeling well, but could
not specify symptoms. Prior to admission, complained of
intermittent nausea and insomnia.

At baseline, the patient has L sided weakness, both UE and LE,
from a previous stroke. He also has speech difficulties from his
most recent strokes in [**12-24**]. He understands some English.  He is
able to ambulate around their house with a cane.
.
ED: L IJ catheter placed. Concern for ischemia (EKG ? ST change
in V6 -> cards felt LVH not acute MI, received ASA and lopressor
IV), meningitis (LP done) or other infection (given tylenol,
vanc, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and gentamicin). He was
transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 and begun on dialysis for a Ca of 12.
.
On floor, pt. underwent HD; renal eval - AVF site warm and
swollen, not tender.  [**8-21**] evening, pt had episode hypotension -
txf to unit for evaluation - pt tx'd for bacteremia, pt bp
stabilized, tx'd with genta/vanco.
.
ROS: daughter denies any fevers, URI sx, diarrhea, chest pain or
SOB; thinks that the patient did have some vomiting yesterday
(day PTA).

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
1. Bacteremia - Given hypotension, pt. in septic shock.
Etiology of bacteremia includes possible AV fistula infxn vs.
endocarditis.  Pt has hx MSSA bacteremia c possible cardiac
emboli involvement (d/c summ [**2-21**]) - at this time, no clinical
signs of endocarditis, all ECHOs neg for vegetations.  LP
results look like viral meningitis (WBC persist to 4th tube,
high protein, neg gram stain). Could be UTI but patient is
virtually anuric. He was sent to the MICU for a brief period
because of hypotension likely secondary to septic shock, adrenal
insufficiency was considered but cosyntropin stimulatory test
was normal.  He also became normotensive with hydration, and did
not require pressors.  His chest xrays show left sided pleural
effusions but no indications of pneumonia.  He Received
gentamicin and vancomycin while the blood cultures were pending
to cover for endocarditis, the vancomycin was changed to
oxacillin when cultures grew MSSA.  A TTE did no show
vegetations and no indications of endocarditis, a followup TEE
also indicated no evidence of endocarditis, thus he was treated
for bacteremia with a five day course of gentamicin and a ten
day course of oxacillin.  He remained afebrile for at least the
last week of his hospital course, with no evidence of infection.

.
2. ESRD - Secondary to hypertenson on hemodialysis. During his
hospital course HD was unable to access HD, a LUE ultrasound
showed patent brachial artery and vein, but very narrowed flow
in AVF, a fistulagram was ordered to followed up. His AVF was
ballooned during the fistulagram and was functioning.  His
electrolytes remained unchanged during the delay in his
hemodialysis, although he developed a slight decline of mental
status from his baseline, which was attributed to uremia, as the
patient was two days past his scheduled dialysis.  He was never
clinically fluid overloaded on exam.  He received HD and his
mental status dramatically improved.  He continued on sensipar
60 mg po qd dinner and his medications were renally dose meds
.
3. Mental status changes were likely due to uremia.  He received
a lumbar puncture which did not show indications of infection,
his viral cultures were negative.  His bacteremia may have
caused presentation of his prior strokes.  Hypercalcemia may
have also contributed to his mental status changes.  During his
hospital course he waxed/waned in mental status, with
correlation to his dialysis status.  He was noted to have
improvements after hemodialysis.
.
4. PAF-He was maintained on ASA and rate controlled with a beta
blocker, but kept off coumadin secondary to a
