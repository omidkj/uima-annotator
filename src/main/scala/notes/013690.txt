Conclusions
PRE CPB The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with apical, distal anterior, distal septal, distal
anterolateral, and distal anteroseptal akinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
very mild anterior leaflet prolapse which combined with some
posterior leaflet retraction results in at least moderate mitral
regurgitation. The mitral regurgitation may actually be slightly
worse as it is an eccentic and posteriorly directed jet. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results in the operating room at the
time of the study.

POST CPB The patient is receiving epinephrine by infusion. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The left ventricle
displays the same regional wall motion abnormalities noted in
the pre bypass study. The mitral regurgitation appears to be
slightly worse - now likely moderate to severe. The thoracic
aorta appears intact. No other significant changes.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Reason: ? ptx after CT removal

Provisional Findings Impression: DLnc WED [**2138-9-17**] 11:25 AM
Stable appearance of post-operative chest. Removal of tubes and
lines as
described. No increase in left pneumothorax after
discontinuation of left
chest tube.

Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after removal of
the chest
tube.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to the prior study
obtained on
[**2138-9-15**].
The patient was extubated in the meantime interval and the
Swan-Ganz catheter was removed. The left chest tube as well as
two mediastinal drains have been also removed in the interim.
The cardiomediastinal contour is stable including
post-sternotomy wires and surgical clips projecting over the mid
sternum. There is no appreciable pneumothorax. There is no
increase in pleural effusion. There is no failure. No change in
the appearance of the right upper lobe bulla is demonstrated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**9-12**] for IV heparin bridge while off coumadin pre-op.
PAT completed over the weekend and underwent surgery with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**9-15**] at which time he had CABGx3 with LIMA-LAD,
SVG-PDA, Lft Rad Artery-Ramus.Please see OR report for details.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition. He did well in the immediate post-op period
and extubated later that afternoon.
He remained hemodynamically stable and on POD1 was transferred
to the step down floor for continued care and recovery. Once on
the floor, he was transfused, his activity level was advanced,
his medications were titrated and on POD6 he was discharged home
with visiting nurses.
