84 yo F with h/o dementia, schizophrenia, CHF, COPD presented to
the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] ED with shortness of breath from her nursing
home.

At her nursing home she was noted to be short of breath, and
found to have an O2 sat in the 70s and a temperature of 100.6.
There she was given nebs and put on 6L and her sat improved to
91%.  transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) **].  At [**Location (un) 620**] she had a chest

Blood Cultures ([**1-28**]): no growth
Urine Culture ([**1-27**]): no growth
.
EKG ([**2138-1-27**]):
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Frequent atrial ectopy.
Diffuse
non-specific ST-T wave flattening. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2131-11-25**] frequent atrial ectopy and increase in rate
have appeared. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
EKG ([**2138-1-28**]):
Sinus rhythm. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave flattening and
slowing of the rate as compared to the previous tracing of
[**2138-1-27**]. Atrial ectopy is no longer recorded.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2138-1-28**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears grossly normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2138-1-31**]:
Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with
preserved global biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The right-sided PICC line is seen
coursing into the right internal jugular vein. There is no
pneumothorax. Bilateral lower lobe opacities are
similar-appearing compared to most recent prior.
IMPRESSION: Right PICC line coursing into the right internal
jugular vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo F with a h/o dementia, schizophrenia, CHF & COPD who
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] ED with shortness of breath from
her nursing home and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as no ICU beds
were available at [**Location (un) 620**]. CXR was consistent with LLL PNA and
volume overload. Patient was initially treated with Azithromycin
and Ceftriaxone and Lasix at [**Location (un) 620**] prior to transfer. At
[**Hospital1 18**], patient was put on a NTG drip and placed on BiPAP. She
was started on IV steroids out of concern for an additional COPD
exacerbation. Antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and
Cefepime. Speech and swallow were consulted regarding concern
for aspiration risk and recommended a dysphagia dieet and
pre-thickened (honey-thick) liquids. The patient's guardian was
[**Name (NI) 653**] during her ICU stay and after transfer to the floor.
It was decided that a G-tube would not be pursued as this was
not within the patient's wishes. All oral medications were
briefly converted to IV formulations but were switched back to
oral prior to discharge. The guardian was [**Name (NI) 653**] following an
additional aspiration event on the medicine floor. It was
decided that antibiotics and steroids should be discontinued and
that goals of care should be directed towards comfort measures
only. The patient was made NPO prior to discharge. The ability
of the patient to take foods by mouth will need to be
readdressed upon return to the [**Hospital 228**] nursing home as future
aspiration events are likely to continue. At the time of
discharge, the patient's guardian was considering making the
patient Do Not Hospitalize.

By Problem:
.
1) Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
Multifactoral from COPD exacerbation, healthcare associated vs
aspiration pneumonia, and acute on chronic diastolic heart
failure. Patient was originally admitted to MICU and initially
had a high supplemental O2 requirement, needing high flow oxygen
via face tent as well as nasal cannula. Through ICU course, was
diuresed with LOS fluid balance of -1.7 L prior to transfer to
medical floor. Treated COPD with standing nebulizers as well as
high dose steroids (first IV solumedrol 50 mg daily and then
prednisone 60 daily) planned for 5 days total. Her pneumonia
(likely aspiration) was treated in MICU with Vancomycin,
Cefepime, and Azithromycin. She completed her course of azithro
prior to transfer to the medical floor and continued on a full
eight day course of Vanc and Cefepime. A PICC line was placed
prior to transfer to medical floor so that patient could
complete her 8 day antibiotic course given that there were no
sputum cultur
