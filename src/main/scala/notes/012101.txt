History of Present Illness:

postoperative course was complicated
by an anastomotic leak and on [**3-4**], he was taken back to the OR
for a reversal of his coloproctostomy and creation of a
diverting colostomy. Subsequent to that, he developed a wound
infection that was opened at the bedside and packed. He was
discharged home on [**3-14**], but coughed on the way home and noted a
gush of fluid at that time from the abdomen. He called his PCP's
office and when examined there, he was found to have a rupture
of a small bowel.  On [**3-14**], he underwent a small bowel resection
and primary closure of the wound. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
late on [**2182-3-16**].

Brief Hospital Course:
46 male s/p lap sigmoid resection complicated by anastomotic
leak, s/p ex-lap with anastomotic resection and end colostomy
complicated by wound dehiscence and bowel perforation, s/p
ex-lap with [**Hospital 80929**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] SICU from [**Hospital **] hospital
early on [**2182-3-17**].  He was made NPO, an NGT was placed, and TPN
via a (L) subclavian CVL  and IV Zosyn and Fluconazole
continued. He was placed on a Dilaudid PCA, and given toladol
and tylenol for pain control with good effect. A VAC dressing
was placed to the adbominal wound. The patient remained
hemodynamically stable during the SICU stay. On [**2182-3-18**], the
patient was transferred to the floor NPO, with the NG tube in
place, continued of IV fluids, same IV antibiotics, and TPN. A
foley catheter was placed. Pain Service was consulted to augment
the patient's pain control regimen; adjustment to the patient's
Dilaudid PCA in addition to the use of Toradol resulted in
improved pain control. On [**2182-3-19**], the NGT and foley were
discontinued. Patient was started on clear liquids, which he
tolerated well. Pain remianed well controlled. He remained
stable. On [**2182-3-20**], flatus was present in ostomy; his diet was
further advanced to regular with continued good tolerability.
He was weaned off the TPN. VAC dressing was changed with noted
improvement of the wound. He was placed on Diludid PO with
round-the-clock tylenol for pain control with excellent effect.
On [**2182-3-21**], the patient complained of mild lower extremity
non-pitting edema with faint, diffuse patchy erythema. Swelling
symmetrical; no knots or calf pain. Negative [**Last Name (un) 5813**] sign. Sent
for bilateral lower extremity duplex venous U/S study, which did
not reveal a DVT. Ambulated frequently. On [**2182-3-22**], IV
antibiotics and the CVL were discontinued. VAC dressing was
taken down with a wet-to-dry dressing placed for discharge home.
Local [**Date Range 269**] will then replace VAC dressing for continued wound
care. He remained stable during his stay on the floor.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable viral signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  Local [**Date Range 269**] will manage the patient's VAC dressing at
home. The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 80930**] and his PCP
