Admission Date:  [**2178-11-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2178-11-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**2120-6-4**]     Sex:  M


CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Shortness of breath times two days.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old
gentleman with end-stage renal disease, usually on
dialyzed two days prior to admission secondary to the
[**Holiday **] holiday, who has a history of bigeminy, on
amiodarone, history of restrictive lung disease, status post
recent admission in [**Month (only) 205**] and [**Month (only) 359**] for hypercarbia with
shortness of breath; now admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for congestive heart failure, hyperkalemia, and
status post wide complex tachycardia responsive to DC

The patient was in his usual state of health until two days
prior to admission when he had the insidious onset of
increased shortness of breath.  The patient then developed
rapid onset of worsening shortness of breath and palpitations
in the evening on the day of admission.  This shortness of
breath progressed, and despite taking an extra half dose of
amiodarone the shortness of breath worsened.  The patient
also noted on the day of admission decreased appetite, chest
pressure, and nausea.  He called emergency medical
technicians who found him to have vague chest discomfort but
a respiratory rate of 36, a saturation of 90%, and bilateral
crackles three quarters of the way up on examination.  The
electrocardiogram by the emergency medical technicians showed
a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of about 180.  He was
given 2 mg of Versed, 100 mg intravenous lidocaine, and 2-mg
per minute drip, and DC cardioversion at 100 joules resulting
in a sinus tachycardia with a left bundle.

The patient was brought to [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department, still in congestive heart
failure, but in sinus rhythm.  His laboratories revealed a
potassium of 6.7.  He was given calcium gluconate 2 g, 1 amp
of D-50, 8 units of regular insulin, a nitroglycerin drip,
and started on BiPAP.  The patient was then admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management including
hemodialysis.

ALLERGIES:  THORAZINE leads to anaphylaxis, H2 BLOCKERS lead
to thrombocytopenia; HALDOL, CLINDAMYCIN, CODEINE lead to
rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  History of
intravenous drug use, on methadone since [**2162**], history of
ethanol, history of tobacco for 20 years times two packs per
day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Per the wife, the patient is not
compliant with his diet.  He has no current chest pain and
some mild shortness of breath.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On initial admission
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit revealed heart rate
was 98, blood pressure 130/54, respiratory rate 17,
temperature 96.9.  In general, the patient was awake,
slightly lethargic, and conversant on BiPAP.  Head, ears,
nose, eyes and throat revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
BiPAP mask was in place.  Neck was supple.  Cardiovascular
revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a [**1-27**] holosystolic
murmur heard best at the apex.  Lungs had bibasilar crackles
one-half of the way up.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.
Extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Radial
pulses 2+, but nonpalpable dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibialis pulses, but lower extremities were warm and well
perfused.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On admission white blood
cell count of 7.9, hematocrit 43.9, platelets 143.  PT 30.4,
INR 6.4, PTT 58.3.  Sodium 137, potassium 6.5, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 24, blood urea nitrogen of 41, creatinine 7.3,
glucose of 138.  Creatine kinase #1 was 29, troponin of less
than 0.3.  Calcium 8.5, magnesium 2.4, phosphate 9.4.  Free
calcium of 1.24.  Arterial blood gas was 7.05 for pH, PO2 93,
and O2 of 423 on FIO2 of 100%, with positive end-airway
pressure of 5, and tidal volume of 750 on BiPAP.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray revealed mild congestive
heart failure.

Electrocardiogram in the field showed wide complex
tachycardia of 180 with a right bundle branch morphology.

Electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department showed sinus
tachycardia at 109, left axis deviation, questionable left
anterior fascicular block, nonspecific ST-T wave
abnormalities, no peaked T waves.  No significant changes
from electrocardiogram of [**2178-9-21**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit then transferred to the floor
after he was stable.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had an episode of wide
complex tachycardia, unclear if it was ventricular
tachycardia, responded to cardioversion in the field.  [**Month (only) 116**]
have been due to the setting of hyperkalemia, but the patient
also has human immunodeficiency virus cardiomyopathy.  The
patient also has a history of atrial flutter with aberrancy.
His amiodarone was continued.  His hyperkalemia was treated.
Cardiology did not recommend an implanted defibrillator.
They recommended continuing his medications as he was doing.

The patient had emergent dialysis, and his potassium was
followed closely.  The patient's volume status was monitored
per the Renal team at dialysis.  The patient had no episodes
on telemetry during the remainder of his hospital stay.

(b)  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient's volume status
was followed per Renal, and volume was removed during
hemodialysis.

2.  PULMONARY:  The patient with respiratory acidosis and
hypercarbia with PCO2 in the 90s which was higher than his
baseline.  On repeat blood gas on [**11-20**], the patient's
pH was 7.22, and his PCO2 was 65, PO2 was 74 on 21%.  The
patient's hypercarbia was thought to likely be secondary to
over narcotic use.  The patient's morphine and oxycodone were
discontinued.  His Duragesic patch was decreased to 50.  He
continued on his methadone.  His saturations remained stable.

3.  RENAL:  The patient was emergency dialyzed when he first
arrived for hyperkalemia.  His last dialysis prior to
discharge was on [**2178-11-23**], and he was due for
dialysis on [**11-26**].  He was continued on his medications
as previously, and his other medications were renally dosed.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was continued on his
antiretroviral and his Bactrim prophylaxis.

5.  HEMATOLOGY:   The patient had an elevated INR.  Coumadin
was held until INR returned to a normal range in the 1.5 to
1.8 range, and the patient was restarted on his Coumadin on
the day of discharge.
