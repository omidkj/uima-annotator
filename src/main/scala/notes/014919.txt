Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
CHB s/p RCA occlusion and stenting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker explant
Central Line placement
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
82yoM w/ PMH DM II, HTN, HL, [**Hospital 2091**] transferred from [**Hospital3 12748**] after admission with CHB s/p RCA occlusion and
stenting and c/b hypotension requiring IABP. He was initially
admitted on [**2165-6-20**] with weakness/dizziness and Vfib arrested in
the ED there. He required 1 shock, epinephrine, and amiodarone.
He subsequently had a temporary pacemaker placed after he was
found to have complete heart block, and he was intubated. This
was replaced with a single chamber cardiac pacemaker ([**Company 1543**]
bipolar pacing lead, Model 4092-58CM) under fluoro on [**2165-6-20**].
He was successfully extubated at 10am on [**2165-6-21**] with no
complications, and was mentating well afterwards. He continued
to have intermittent hypotension to SBP's 70's and continued to
require dopamine.
.
Febrile to 101.4 on [**6-20**]. Sputum on [**6-21**] showed 4+ GN
coccobacilli, 2+ GP cocci, 1+ GNR, 1+ GPR. Treated for
aspiration PNA with IV levaquin and flagyl. Received three doses
of ancef post-procedure.
.
This AM, patient began complaining of chest pain with a bump in
his troponin (54-->93.94). He had ECG changes, he was taken
emergently to the cath lab where his RCA was found to have 99%
stenosis. Right and left heart cath was done and showed PCWP 7,
left main normal, left circ normal, LAD with 70% proximal
lesion, RCA with 99% mid and 80% distal disease s/p placement of
two bare metal stents and post-dilation with good results. Due
to hypotension, Intraortic balloon pump was subsequently placed
and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On the [**Location (un) 7622**] ride over to [**Hospital1 18**], patient had received 100mcg
of fentanyl for [**9-17**] chest/back pain. Per EMS report, this
improved his pain and he was talking/smiling/interactive. Then,
20 minutes later, he became unresponsive and had left-deviated
gaze with no tracking. He had no arrhythmia and VSS during this
time as per EMS report. After 5 minutes of unresponsiveness, he
was intubated (given another 150mcg fentanyl and also given
etomidate). On arrival to the CCU, MAPs are in mid-50's. He was
initially quite somnolent, but opened his eyes on request (in
[**Month/Year (2) 8003**]). Approximately 30 min later, he is following all
commands.
.
Review of systems could not be obtained as patient is intubated.

Labs at discharge:

.
Abdominal ultrasound [**6-27**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderately distended gallbladder containing sludge, but no
specific
findings of acute cholecystitis.
2. Right pleural effusion.
.
EKG: [**6-26**]
Sinus rhythm and marked A-V conduction delay with atrial
bigeminy. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2165-6-26**] no diagnostic interim change.
Clinical
correlation is suggested.
.
ECHO [**6-23**]:
The left atrium is normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior, and
inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract well (LVEF=
30-35%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left and right ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w CAD (proximal RCA distribution involving RV and
PDA territories).


Brief Hospital Course:
82yoM w/ PMH IDDM, HTN, HL presents s/p RCA occlusion and BMS x
2 c/b complete heart block, hypotension w/ intraaortic balloon
pump in place, and also w/ episode unresponsiveness during
transport today.
.
# Cardiogenic Shock: Transferred from OSH with intraaortic
balloon pump (IABP) felt likely secondary to RV infarct given
low PCWP and high right-sided pressures. Patient remained
intubated while IABP used due to concerns with position. He was
weaned off of the IABP and dopamine drip, then subsequently
successfully extubated.
.
# Hospital Acquired Pneumonia: Patient had been treated for
aspiration PNA at OSH with levo/flagyl.  On admission here, he
was broadened to vanc/cefepime/flagyl for possibility of HAP.
Blood cultures grew coag negative staph in one out of four
bottles, thought to be a contaminant.  Patient was transitioned
back to PO levo/flagyl for total of 8 day course, with the last
day being [**6-29**].
.
# Coronary Artery Disease: Status bare metal stent x 2 to
mid-RCA at outside hospital prior to transfer.  Upon arrival, he
was continued on ASA, plavix, lipitor and integrillin gtt.  Beta
blocker and ACE-inhibitor were initially held given hypotension
and use of pressors, and continue to be held because of AV nodal
block and resolving ARF. Pt was on Carvediolol and Lisinopril
prior to admission and should be restarted in the future.
.
# Cholecystitis: The patient developed intermittent right upper
quadrant abdominal pain on [**2165-6-27**] that on exam initially was
mild without [**Doctor Last Name **] sign. A RUQ ultrasound showed biliary sludge
but no stones or signs of obstruction. The following day his RUQ
became more tender, now with positive [**Doctor Last Name **] sign and worsening
leukocyt
