female with severe aortic stenosis who was straining on the
toilet yesterday for several hours.  She had some chest
discomfort, took a Nitroglycerin and later was found by her
home health aide passed out on the toilet.  The patient was
brought to [**Hospital1 69**] after
regaining consciousness.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was found with
melanotic stool by the resident, taken by GI for EGD, which
showed gastritis but no reason for bleed.  Also had some
melanotic stool in the GI Suite.

She has chronic abdominal pain; has had constipation for the
past week without bowel movement.

2.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  Osteoporosis.
5.  Bilateral cataracts.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives at home with a Home Health Aide.  No

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 97.4 F.;
heart rate 76; blood pressure 114/40; respiratory rate 25; O2
saturation 100% on two liters nasal cannula.  In general, she
was in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Unremarkable.  Chest clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Coronary:  III/VI systolic
ejection murmur.  Abdomen had decreased bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, melanotic stool on rectal examination.
Extremities two plus bilateral lower extremity edema.
Neurologic was nonfocal.

LABORATORY:  On admission included a white count of 24.8,
hematocrit of 29.3, down from 37.5 on initial admission to
the Emergency Department.  Platelets are 446.  Chem-7:
Sodium 138, potassium 4.8, chloride 99, bicarbonate 29, BUN
42, creatinine 1.4, glucose 293.

Head CT scan in the Emergency Room showed no hemorrhage, no
acute changes.

Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiac or pulmonary process.

Abdominal x-ray showed that the patient was status post left
open reduction and internal fixation.  No acute changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Floor for
management of presumed lower GI bleed given the negative EGD.
1.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was initially transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where she was transfused a
total of four units during the course of her first 48 hours
in-house.  The plan was to get the patient prepped for a
colonoscopy but this proved to be difficult as the patient
refused the prep on the first day.  On the second day, she
agreed to it but only with magnesium citrate.  She was
finally prepped by hospital day three and taken to the GI
Suite.

When colonoscopy was ultimately done, it revealed blood in
the entire colon, diverticulosis in the entire colon and the
entire colon was visualized except the cecal cap but no
evidence for source of the GI bleed could be found.  As such,
a bleeding scan was recommended.

The patient was approached with these results and told that
she needed a bleeding scan, however, the patient refused this
test.  Therefore, she was watched overnight.  The night
following her colonoscopy, her hematocrit had dropped
approximately a point.  She then agreed to the bleeding scan
at that time.  She was taken for a bleeding scan on hospital
day four, which showed no acute evidence of bleeding.

Following this, the recommendation of the GI Team was to have
a small bowel follow through to rule out significant small
bowel pathology.  The patient, however, flat out refused this
test.  Because of this, we simply monitored her hematocrit
for the remaining time in-house.

Her hematocrit remained essentially stable although it had
drifted down approximately a half to one point a day, down to
28.5 on the day of discharge.  Because of this, she was given
one final unit of blood and will be discharged out with
instructions to see her primary care physician regularly, to
have her hematocrit checked, and to watch her stools for
evidence of melena, given the fact that no source of this
bleed was ever found.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient's initial syncopal event was
almost certainly due to the fact that she took a
Nitroglycerin with a stenotic aortic valve area of 0.6.
In-house we wrote strict orders for the patient to have no
Nitroglycerin if she developed chest pain.  She had no
further evidence of syncope or lightheadedness.

3.  Infectious Disease:  In the hospital, her urine came back
dirty, with evidence for a urinary tract infection.  She was
started on Ciprofloxacin for seven days.

4.  Hypokalemia:  The patient's potassium was low at several
points during her hospital stay.  It was repleted.  The day
of discharge, it had been stable for several days.

5.  DISPOSITION:  The patient was safe for discharge [**Last Name (LF) 2974**],
[**5-8**], however, she refused to leave saying that there was
no one at home.  Her attending approached her regarding this
and the house staff approached her and the nursing staff.
She simple flat out refused.  It was decided to allow her to
stay until Monday when she said her home health aide would be
available at home.  She also was seen by Physical Therapy and
they recommended a short course of rehabilitation but she
refused to go to any rehabilitation facility.

As such, we are discharging her on Monday, the 13th, to home.
She will have [**Hospital6 407**] follow-up and home
Physical Therapy evaluation.
