[**2130-9-12**]:  EKG:

Sinus tachycardia. Minor ST-T wave abnormalities. No previous
tracing available for comparison

[**2130-9-12**]: Chest x-ray and pelvis:

 IMPRESSION: Fractures of the left superior and inferior pubic
rami. No chest pathology identified, although wide mediastinum
is noted. While likely due to tortuosity and possibly
lipomatosis, mediastinal vascular injury cannot be excluded in
the setting of trauma. Correlate with cross-sectional imaging

[**2130-9-12**]: cat scan of abdomen/chest:

 Acute left inferior pubic ramus fracture.
2. Left thigh hematoma with potential areas of active
extravasation noted
within the gluteal musculature. Findings discussed with surgical
resident
consultant at the time of attending review.
3. 6-mm right lung nodule should have followup CT in 12 months
to document
stability

[**2130-9-12**]:  Cat scan of head:

IMPRESSION: Right subgaleal hematoma but no acute intracranial
process





Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] was brought to the Emergency Department and admitted
to the Acute Care Service on [**2130-9-12**] after being struck
by a motor vehicle traveling at 25 mph.  In the ED, the left
gluteal hematoma appeared to have extravasation with a
concomittant systolic blood pressure drop into the 80s.
Therefore, the patient was transfused with 1 unit of PRBCs and
given fluid resuscitation with adequate response and SBP to
120s. Interventional radiology was consulted and the patient
underwent an aortogram and left iliac angiogram without
identification of aneurysm or extravasation.  The patient
remained hemodynamically stable in the recovery room.

The patient was initially managed in the surgical intensive care
unit post-procedure and was transferred to the surgical [**Hospital1 **] on
hospital day #2.  Hematocrit levels were monitored and he
continued to have a decrease in his hematocrit.  His current
hematocrit has stablized at 25.0.  His foley catheter has been
discontinued.  He has been evaluated by physical therapy and has
been cleared to go home with VNA services

His vital signs are stable.  He did have an elevation in his
blood pressure and heart this morning when he got out of bed,
but vital signs returned to [**Location 213**] when he returned to bed.  He
is tolerating a regular diet and has not had any problems with
voiding.

He is preparing for discharge today and will follow up 2-3 weeks
with his Primary Care Provider and in 4 weeks with Orthopedic
Nurse Practitioner, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
