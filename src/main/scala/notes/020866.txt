Service:  CCU

This is an interval summary that will cover the period
[**2137-5-6**], through [**2137-5-17**].

HOSPITAL COURSE: (continued)
Ischemia - On [**2137-5-6**], the patient underwent repeat
catheterization with stents placed in the saphenous vein
graft to right coronary artery as well as to the left
subclavian arteries.  The patient tolerated this procedure
well without complication and the patient was transferred
back to the CCU intubated on Levophed as well as Nordinone
pressors for blood pressure support.

Status post intervention, the patient's CK enzymes were
repeatedly cycled and did not show an elevation from a high
of 378 on [**2137-5-2**].  Postprocedure on [**2137-5-6**], the patient
had a CK of 196 which was not significantly changed over the
ensuing four days.

Status post procedure, the patient was continued on Aspirin
as well as Plavix.  Plavix had been begun on [**2137-5-6**], at 300
mg and was then continued at 75 mg OGT q.d.  There were no
further significant changes in the patient's ischemic heart
disease to this date from [**2137-5-6**], through the current date.

Pump - The patient was initially transferred from the
catheterization laboratory with a Swan catheter in place with
systolic blood pressure on the day after intervention ranging
between 99 and 104 and diastolic blood pressure ranging
between 54 and 61 with a MAP of 67 to 74.  Pulmonary artery
pressure ranged between 57/61 to 31/34 with a central venous
pressure of 12 to 14 and a cardiac output of 4.7 with a
systemic vascular resistance of 936.

The patient was continued on Nordinone as well as Levophed
for blood pressure maintenance and did not require an
intra-aortic balloon pump status post procedure.  The patient
was rapidly tapered off Nordinone and Levophed drips which
were both discontinued by [**2137-5-9**].  The patient for the
remainder of the dictated time period had systolic blood
pressure generally ranging in the mid 80 to mid 90 range.

The patient's Swan catheter was discontinued on or about
[**2137-5-9**], secondary to concerns surrounding possibility of
line sepsis.  Swan numbers on [**2137-5-9**], with a blood pressure
of 88/52 and MAP of 64 showed a pulmonary artery pressure of
59/33 with a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 42 and a
central venous pressure of 12.  Cardiac output was 4.1,
cardiac index 1.94, systemic vascular resistance of 976.
While the first dictated numbers were taken on Levophed and
Nordinone, the last dictated numbers were off these pressors.

The patient was known to have an ejection fraction of between
10 and 20% by echocardiography on [**2137-5-2**], and at the time
that this dictation covers initially the patient was noted to
be quite significantly volume overloaded with pitting edema
to or past the knees bilaterally and length of stay fluid
balance of between five and six liters positive.

The patient was aggressively diuresed with Lasix drip until
the night of [**2137-5-16**], when hypotension with systolic blood
pressure in the mid 70s necessitated stopping this Lasix drip
noting that the patient had become length of stay volume
status negative in the ensuing time.  It was felt that the
patient on [**2137-5-17**], was essentially somewhat volume depleted
and, in fact, chest x-ray demonstrated resolving congestive
heart failure.

Rhythm - The patient has been in normal sinus rhythm for the
majority of this dictated time period.  However, a thirty
beat run of ventricular tachycardia was noted at 4:00 a.m. on
[**2137-5-7**].  With the exception of one further eight beat run
of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia at 2200 hours on
[**2137-5-12**], no further significant runs of abnormal rhythms
were noted, though sparse ectopy was evident on telemetry,
decreasing during the course of this admission.

Please note that the most recent eight beat run of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurred in the setting
of abnormal electrolytes which were later repleted.  If the
patient affects a substantial recovery from his current state
might be considered for electrophysiology study should such
arrhythmias occur and at this time we are continuing to
monitor for them using telemetry.

Pulmonary - Congestive heart failure - As noted in greater
detail in the pump section of cardiovascular above, the
patient was initially on [**2137-5-6**], noted to be in significant
congestive heart failure with a chest x-ray read as follows:
congestive heart failure without evidence of pneumonia.
Later chest CT on [**2137-5-12**], did demonstrate continuing
congestive heart failure, however, by the chest x-ray of
[**2137-5-15**], [**2137-5-16**], and [**2137-5-17**], the congestive heart
failure was noted to be significantly improved.  The patient
has not had difficulties with oxygenation during this
interval.

Pneumonia - As noted in the prior discharge summary for this
patient, the patient was originally admitted with a several
week history of cough and had been placed on antibiosis
including Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Flagyl for possible
aspiration pneumonia.  A chest CT performed on [**2137-5-12**],
demonstrated right paratracheal and precarinal
lymphadenopathy with the largest node in the prevascular
space measuring approximately 12 millimeters in short axis.
Additionally, bilateral air space opacities most prominent in
the lung apices and in the region of the left upper lobe and
lingula were noted concerning for multifocal pneumonia.

The patient was at that time and has continued to be febrile
and at the suggestion of infectious disease was begun on
Estrianam and Vancomycin for possibility of ventilator
acquired pneumonia.  A sputum from [**2137-5-17**], is pending at
this time.  One from [**2137-5-11**], showed greater than 25 PMNs
and less than 10 epithelial cells with no micro-organisms.
There was also noted to be gram negative rods on sputum gram
stain which was not later confirmed on culture.  The patient
for this finding of gram negative rod on gram stain was
transiently covered for gram negative pneumonia with Ceptaz
added to the patient's regimen to cover for the possibility
of pseudomonal pneumonia.  This was later discontinued when
culture failed to reveal pseudomonas or other gram negative
agents.

Pulmonary emboli - Again on the CT scan of [**2137-5-12**], the
patient was noted to have small bilateral lower lobe filling
defects consistent with small pulmonary emboli and the
patient was begun on Heparin shortly thereafter on which he
continues to this point with appropriate checks of partial
thromboplastin time and other coagulation studies.  The
Heparin will be held for procedures such as tracheostomy
placement scheduled for [**2137-5-17**].

Ventilator status - The patient has been on endotracheal
intubation since [**2137-5-1**], and continues through the time of
this interval dictation summary with the plan for
tracheostomy today, [**2137-5-17**].  Repeated attempts have been
made to wean the patient off initial settings of assist
control with 650 by 14 with 40% FIO2 and 5 of PEEP.  Over the
past week, attempts have been made to change the patient's
CPAP of pressure support with periods of resting on assist
control overnight to increase the strength of the patient's
respiratory muscles.

The patient at this time has not tolerated well attempts to
wean pressure support responding with tachypnea and
tachycardia to these efforts when pressure support is
decreased, however, he has been able to sustain a prolonged
period of CPAP plus pressure support on 10 and 5 with periods
of resting and the hope is that he will continue to move
towards weaning from the ventilation.

Pulmonology was consulted to assist in weaning this gentleman
from the ventilator and suggested a slow wean with attempts
to switch to pressure support ventilation and keep tidal
volume greater than 400 and respiratory rate less than 30
with a normal pH.  They suggest weaning pressure support
level by greater than or equal to 2 centimeters per day.

Infectious disease - The patient has had multiple blood
cultures including blood cultures of fungal isola
