Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy, blood transfusions, platelets
EGD


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is [**Age over 90 **] yo female with a h/o MDS, pulmonary fibrosis,
UGIB
and HTN who presents with LGIB.

She had been at home in her usual state of health. Got up to go
to the bathroom this am, had what she thought was diarrhea, then
called EMS today as she felt too weak to get off toilet. On
their arrival, they found gross blood/clots in toilet in
addition to bloody stool all over apartment. The pt syncopized
when helped off toilet x 1 minute.

Upon arrival to ED, temp was 96.6, HR 96, BP 108/53, RR 17, and
pulse ox 100% on room air. She was tachycardic and in atrial
fibrillation. NG lavage was performed and was negative. Labs
were notable for elevated creatinine 2.6 (baseline 1 year ago
~2.0), anemic with hct to 17 (baseline 1 year ago ~ 30), trop
0.02, CK 18, INR was 1.6, not anticoagulated. She was ordered
for 4 units PRBCs and 4 units FFP, had received 2 units pRBCs
and 3 units FFP prior to transfer. She was transiently
hypotensive 67-80/33-42, improved to >100 after 2L NS and above
products. GI was consulted in ED, recommended monitoring at
present as pt not prepped with consideration of tagged red blood
cell scan if pt continues to bleed briskly. The general surgical
service was also consulted given the degree of hematocrit drop,
will see her in ICU. At time of transfer to the ICU the
patient's VS: 97.3 95 (AF) 111/50 14 NRB 100% (96% on NC
initially). She has 2 large bore PIVs in place, was alert and
oriented x 3. Is accompanied by her son. Confirmed to be full
code in ED.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt is stable, resting comfortably. Only
complaint is slight back ache after laying down all day. Denies
having diarrhea prior to this morning, denies noting BRBPR or
melena recently. No abd pain. Did have one episode of emesis
this morning, did not notice if there was blood/coffee grounds.
No chest pain, no palpitations. Notes that she usually has
shortness of breath for which she will use supplemental 02 at
home, but this is no worse than baseline. No dizziness. Has
noted increase LE edema for the past 10 days or so which she has
noted has started to weep. ROS was otherwise essentially
negative.

[**2197-5-17**] Echo - The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-2-3**], RV
dilation and dysfunction are now seen.

[**2197-5-16**] EGD -
Normal mucosa in the stomach
Ulceration in the duodenum (injection, endoclip, thermal
therapy)
Abnormal mucosa in the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

[**2197-5-17**] CXR
There is a bilateral fluid marking of the interstitium. The
right
costophrenic sinus is obliterated, potentially by a small
pleural effusion.  The pulmonary vessels show a moderate
increase in caliber. Overall, the signs must be interpreted as
moderate overhydration. Otherwise, no relevant changes. Severe
scoliosis with resulting asymmetry of the rib cage. Moderate
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No focal parenchymal opacity
suggestive of pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yo female with history of bleeding gastric ulcers,
myelodysplasia, pulmonary fibrosis, and hypertension was
admitted with anemia and GI bleed.

1. GI Bleed
Patient had a negative NG lavage in the Emergency Department.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient underwent an upper EGD which
revealed a duodenal ulcer. The ulcer was clipped. She received a
total of 4 units packed RBCs and her hematocrit improved from 17
to ~26 and has remained stable since her transfusions. We would
recommend that you check an H. pylori serology when she arrives
at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.

2. Coagulopathy
Patient had an elevated INR of 1.6 on admission. This was
thought related to a nutritional deficiency in the setting of
diarrhea in the days prior to admission. This improved with
Vitamin K and FFP to 1.2.

3. Atrial Fibrillation
Patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation in the Emergency
Department. It is unclear if this is an old or new diagnosis as
patient reports having been told that she has an abnormal rhythm
by her visiting nurse. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8675**] was slightly elevated at 5.6. She
is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to her GI bleed. She
remained under adequate control with heart rates of 90-100 while
off of her beta blocker. Please restart her beta blocker as her
blood pressure improves.

4. Myelodysplasia
She has a history of myelodysplasia and was followed by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2539**] in hematology clinic at [**Hospital1 18**]. During a recent
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2539**] in [**3-6**], her WBC was noted to be
rising, concerning for development of a malignant process. Given
her age and the limited benefit of aggressive therapy for this
patient, further treatment was not pursued by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2539**] at that
time.

5. Pulmonary Fibrosis:
Patient has a history of pulmonary fibrosis and is on 2L of home
oxygen. Her O2 requirement was stable.

6. Hypertension
She has a history of hypertension and is on metoprolol,
amlodipine, and HCTZ-triamterene. These medicat
