Brief Hospital Course:
40 year old female admitted via ED after pressumed struck by a
car vs s/p assault, intubated at OSH. A CT scan revealed
bilateral frontoparietal hemorrhages, skull base fracture, and
diffuse cerebral edema. The patient was administered Dilantin,
Decadron and mannitol. A bolt was placed on the right side on
[**2194-1-10**] to monitor ICP. Started kefzol while bolt in place.
Intial ICP is ~50, despite mannitol administration ICP's
remained high therefore patient placed on pentabarb coma on [**1-10**]
and discontinued on [**2194-1-12**].

The patient was taken to the OR on [**2194-1-11**] for a right
hemicraniotomy and temporal lobectomy for increased vasogenic
edema surrounding the bilateral frontal and temporal lobe
hemorrhagic contusions and ICP's continued to be high . A
post-op CT scan showed no new hemorrhages or mass effect. The
right side bolt was removed on the same day of surgery.

Patient started on tube feeds however patient unable to
tolarete, therefore placed on a total parenteral nutrition.
Patient has been febrile since admission. Initial blood cultures
and urine culture was negative fo growth but sputum cultures
from [**2194-1-10**] grew H. influenzae and yeast, Ampicillin is
(sensetive to H. flu)started, she received a 10 day course per
ID and did not need any further antibiotics.

On [**1-11**] there was questionable seizure activity which was left
sided shakiness and twitching on the face. EEG revealed [**1-11**]
encephlopathy repeat on [**1-18**] no seizure activity.

After discontinuing the pentabarb, the patient opened her eyes
and moved all four extremities in response to pain. A CTA of the
head and neck obtained on [**2194-1-13**] was negative for dissection.
A repeat CT head [**1-13**] showed a slight increase of edema in the
left temporal lobe. Restarted her methadone as she was dose to
half her home dosage. Urine culture [**1-14**] grew enterococcus
sensetive to ampicillin as well.

On [**2194-1-17**] and [**1-20**] LP preformed  to rule meningitis for
ongoing fever. Gram stain of CSF was negative for any infectious
process.

Patient neurologically improwed slowly and gradually, able  to
extubate approximately on [**1-19**] and was transferred to the
neurostep down on [**1-21**]

While in stepdown unit her antibiotic course was completed and
no further antibiotics were needed per ID.  Her tube feedings
were at goal.  She was fitted for a helmet in order to begin
ambulation.  She had survelliance LENIs on [**1-20**] which were
negative for an DVT.  Neurologically she was awake, alert,
followed simple commmands, attempted to speak with a weak voice.
 Her head incision was noted to have some breakdown near where
the helmet ended, a wound care consult was obtained and patient
was started on Keflex.
On the afternoon of [**2194-1-25**] she was noted to be tachypnic,
tachycardic, and hypotensive.  The house officer was called and
responded (see HO note).  Pt deteriorated quickly and a code was
called several minutes after the HO had begun assessing the pt.
The code ran for over 40 min but the pt was never in a stable
perfusing rythym.  Pt was declared dead and the medical examiner
has elected to perform the post-mortem.
