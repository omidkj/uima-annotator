Allergies:
Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4111**]
Chief Complaint:
enterocutaneous fistula

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
On [**2104-1-3**] he was taken to the operating room for (1)
Exploratory laparotomy, (2)lysis of adhesions (3.5 hours), (3)
Enterectomy, (4) enteroenterostomy, (5)colostomy, (6) closure of
2 enterotomies, (7) feeding jejunostomy, (8) component
separation and (9) placement of Vicryl mesh to reinforce the
closure.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 82 male who underwent a large bowel resection [**4-25**]
for a sigmoid vulvulous at the [**Hospital6 6689**].  His
course was complciated by an enterocutaneous fistula and MRSA
wound infection.  On [**2103-8-16**] he was taken back to the operating
room for lysis of adhesions, takedown of the enterocutaneous
fistula, and a small bowel resction. Post-operatively he had a
wound dehisence. On [**2103-8-21**] the patient returned to the OR for
an abdominal exploration with debridement of abdominal wound and
fascia and wound closure with insertion of Sergisis.  The
exterocutaneous fistula evidentally recurred.  On [**2103-11-27**] he was
taken to the OR for STSG of the abdominal wound.  The fistula
was closed with a chromic stitch with fibrin glue.  A full
thickness skin graft was laid over this. Postoperatively the
patient continued to have problems with drainage of the inferior
protion of the wound in the location of the fistula.  A fistula
again developed.  He was transfered to the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**]
at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2103-12-6**] for definitive care of this fistula.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25699**] was admited to the general surgery service under Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 957**].  He was made NPO and TPN was started.  His wound
was dressed by the surgical team with the ostomy nurse. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
was used to keep the fistula contents away from the skin. From
[**12-5**] through [**1-2**] this same routine was continued.  His
nutritional status was improved, and PT worked with him to
improve his strength. However, given his deconditioning, he was
not able to ambulate prior to surgery.

On [**2104-1-3**] he was taken to the operating room for (1)
Exploratory laparotomy, (2)lysis of adhesions (3.5 hours), (3)
Enterectomy, (4) enteroenterostomy, (5)colostomy, (6) closure of
2 enterotomies, (7) feeding jejunostomy, (8) component
separation and (9) placement of Vicryl mesh to reinforce the
closure.  There were no complications but he was transfered to
the SICU from the OR for close monitoring.  He was extubated
prior to transfer.  On POD 1 his respiratory status declined
likely secondary to fluid shifts; he was re-intubated.  He was
able to be weaned from the vent the following day and was
extubated [**1-7**] with success.  TF were started at 10cc on POD 1.
Over the next week his tube feeds were advanced daily, he was
diuresed as needed, and he was placed on agressive pulmonary
toliet.  His TPN was decreased as TF were slowly advanced.  On
[**2104-1-6**] he proved to be positive for heparin-dependent
antiboties; he was diagnosed with heparin induced
throbocytopenia thus all heparin products were discontinued and
prophylaxis was continued with venodynes on at all times.  On
[**2104-1-6**] he also spiked a temperature.  Blood cx later showed
Vancomycin resistant enterococcus. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed
MRSA. On [**2107-1-10**] he tested positive for Cdiff and he was given
appropriate antibiotics to treat all of these infections.
Gastrograffin study on [**1-13**] demonstrated passage through small
intestine and into colon easily, and the patient was begun on
soft mechanical diet. He demonstrated questionable ability to
eat without coughing and a swallow study was obtained that
demonstrated overt aspiration signs with all consistencies.
Nutrition was therefore continued with TPN and tube feeds alone.


[**1-18**] the patient suddenly became confused with slurred speech
while resting comfortably in bed moments before. While examining
the patient he spiked temperature to 102, became tachycardic to
120s and was not able to follow commands. EKG showed no acute
changes, stat head CT was normal and he proved to have blood
cultures positive for pan-sensitive enterococcus for which he
was appropriately treated and his clinical picture quickly
improved. He remained stable for the next week before he
developed some mild abdominal distension and serial abdominal
plain films showed a persistent dilated loop of bowel in the
LUQ. Tube feeds were held and on [**1-28**] a gatrograffin enema was
obtained that showed no colonic stricture/obstruction however
was not quite normal due to apparent mucosal and anastamotic
abnormalities. Tube feeds were re-initiated and a video swallow
showed evidence that patient could tolerate thin liquids and
pureed diet without significant aspiration risk. He tolerated
this diet for several days with 1:1 feedings, however on [**2-3**] he
had an aspiration event and was transferred back to the
intensive care unit after emergent intubation for respiratory
distress. On [**2-6**] his sputum grew ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII
sensitive to gent, imipenem and tobramycin and he was started on
imipenem.

He was weaned from the ventilator over several days and
extubated on [**2-7**]. However he was electively re-intubated later
the same day for hypercarbia. Antibiotics, TPN and tube feeds
were continued and the patient was very gently diuresed over the
next week. By [**2-12**] he was felt to be euvolemic and he
successfully extubated on [**2-13**]. His family requested his
transfer to a facility closer to home, and now that he is stable
post-extubation this request can be more safely honored. He is
being transferred afebrile, tolerating tube feeds (half strength
impact with fiber at 40cc/hour) and has completed a 14 day
course of imipenem for an acinetobacter pneumonia. He has a
small open part of his abdominal incision that is nearly
completely granulated but will continue to need wet to dry
dressings until completely healed. He was transferred to
[**Hospital **] Hospital in stable condition and with instructions to
remain NPO with TF for nutrition. Instructions were given to
continue pulmonary toilet with nebulizer treatments.
