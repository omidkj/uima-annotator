History of Present Illness:
60 y.o. M with hx of ESRD s/p cadaveric renal tx in [**2155**], on
immunosuppressants, Hep C, HTN, [**Year (4 digits) 2320**], PVD presents from home
with  fever to 105.8.  Patient says he was in his usual state of
health as recently as Weds, when he saw his cardiologist in
preparation for hernia repair surgery early next week.  Some of
his usual medications including his prophylactic bactrim were
held and he stayed home from work trying to avoid sick contacts
pre-operatively.  On Thursday afternoon he started to feel some
malaise and his temperature started to rise.  He took some
tylenol and his fever appeared initially to abate, but returned
[**Year (4 digits) 2974**] with nausea and vomiting, constant shivering, shoulder
aches, headaches, and three episodes of loose stools.  Denies
any urinary symptoms (no changes in color, consistency, dysuria,
frequency, urgency), abd pain, neck stiffness, cough or cold
symptoms.  No sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] recent travel.  He was last
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**4-23**] to [**5-2**] for new diagnosis of atrial
flutter, acute on chronic renal failure and HAP.
.
In the ED, patient had labs which showed and elevated white
count with a 10% bandemia.  He had a CXR which was negative for
any acute process.  A R IJ line was placed and he was started on
Vancomycin and Gentamycin for presumptive endocarditis.  UA,
urine culture, and blood cultures were sent.  No recent invasive
dental work.  No recent IVDU.

Pertinent Results:
CXR: Limited study, no evidence of PNA
.
ECHO ([**2159-4-30**]):
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The interatrial septum is aneurysmal. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets appear normal The
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. A paravalvular aortic valve leak is present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-6-16**], the
aortic prosthesis gradient is significantly elevated. Preserved
systolic function with elevated filling pressures is similar.
.
CT Torso: [**5-29**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Decreased volume of air within the collecting system of the
transplant kidney. There is no significant perinephric stranding
about the transplant or about the transplant ureter. This
suggests possibility that this air may have been related to
Foley catheter insertion.
2. New ascites is seen within the peritoneal cavity which
extends into the patient's left inguinal hernia.
3. Increasing bilateral airspace opacities with infectious
etiologies as a differential consideration. Recommend clinical
correlation.
.
[**5-31**]: LENI:
IMPRESSION: No DVT in both lower extremities.
.
[**6-3**]: CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-1**] and 17:
Mild pulmonary edema, seen best in perihilar left lung has
worsened slightly since [**6-2**], accompanied by persistent
increase in caliber of mediastinal veins. Right lung base is
elevated, and atelectasis may explain consolidation in the right
lower lung, but I am more concerned this is pneumonia. Mild
cardiomegaly stable. Anatomic detail in the upper lungs is
obscured by radiographic technique. No pneumothorax is present.
Pleural effusion if any is minimal, on the right. Moderate
cardiomegaly unchanged. Right jugular line ends in the SVC.
.
[**2159-6-5**]: NC Head CT: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or large
[**Month/Day/Year 1106**] territory infarction; if suspicion for infarct is
present, MRI would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation.
2. Air-fluid levels in paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
may relate in part to recent intubation and recently removed NG
tube.
.
[**2159-6-5**]: RU Noninvasive: IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of
deep venous thrombosis in the right upper extremity. Right
cephalic vein was not visualized in the present exam.
.
[**2159-6-6**]: MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**]: FINDINGS: There is diffuse low signal
visualized in the vertebral bodies which could be due to marrow
hyperplasia or infiltration and clinical correlation
recommended. There is no evidence of ligamentous disruption seen
on limited evaluation on the sagittal inversion recovery images.
From C2-3 to C4-5 no significant disc bulge, herniation, spinal
stenosis or foraminal narrowing seen.
At C5-6 there is posterior ridging and bulging with mild spinal
stenosis and minimal extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord.
Mild bilateral foraminal narrowing seen.
At C6-7 there is mild disc bulging and left-sided foraminal
narrowing seen.
At C7-T1 and T1-2 no significant abnormaliti
