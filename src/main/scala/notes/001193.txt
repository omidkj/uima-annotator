History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 496**] is a 61 M with a medical history notable for
celiac disease. Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**2103-9-10**] to [**2103-9-19**] for worsening GI symptoms thought to be
related to his difficult-to-control celiac disease. He was
started on budesonide, loperamide, and TPN. An endoscopy
performed during that admission revealed duodenitis.

He reports feeling well at dischcarge on the TPN and was even
able to travel on [**Hospital3 **]. However, approximately 3 weeks ago
he noted marked fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. He is currently
very weak and unable to perform basic activities around his
house. His abominal cramping has also increased and his diarrhea
has returned. His bowel movements are "muddy" with rare bright
red blood (usually with straining), but no melena. No NSIADs or
recent alcohol use.

Since discharge he was started on prednisone and started on
mercaptopurine on [**11-5**]. He was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic on [**11-5**].
After his routine laboratory studies returned with worsening
anemia he was referred to the ED.

Vital signs on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED: T 98.2, P 100, BP 129/76,
100% RA. His evaluation in the ED was notable for a HCT of 22.5,
guaiac positive stool, and a negative gastric lavage. In the ED
he received pantoprazole 40mg IV, morphine, 1 unit of packed red
blood cells, and IV fluids.

On [**2103-11-7**] he underwent EGD showing friable duodenal mucosa
with contact bleeding. Since the procedure he has had worsening
abdominal pain, and was found to have copious free air on CXR
and KUB. We were contact[**Name (NI) **] to evaluate him for possible
perforation.

Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Celiac disease diagnosed in [**2097**] after work-up for osteoporosis

Social History:
Patient lives with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] is a retired history teacher. He
has two children. Patient reports smoking a pipe occassionally
and previously drank wine on occasions but none recently.

Family History:
He is adopted and has no family history of sprue of which he is
aware. Has two healthy children.

Physical Exam:
Vital Signs: T 99.3, P 83, BP 132/83, 96% on RA. Current pain
[**4-23**].

Physical examination prior to EGD by GI on [**2103-11-7**]:
- Gen: Thin male, appears chronically ill.
- HEENT: Pale conjunctiva. Oropharynx clear w/out lesions.
- Chest: Normal respirations and breathing comfortably on room
air. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
- CV: Regular rhythm. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs or gallops. JVP
<5 cm.
- Abdomen: Normal bowel sounds. He is diffusely tender
throughout his abdomen with no rebound or guarding.
- Extremities: 1+ ankle edema to the knees bilaterally.
- Skin: No lesions, bruises, rashes.
- Neuro: Alert, oriented x3. Good fund of knowledge. Able to
discuss current events and memory is intact. CN 2-12 intact.
Speech and language are normal.
- Psych: Appearance, behavior, and affect all normal.

Upon surgical evaluation after the EGD:
96.8 127 128/74 22 99% 2L
uncomfortable, anxious
no respiratory distress
abdomen distended, tympanytic +rebound +guarding
no scars, no hernias

CXR [**2103-11-7**]: In comparison with the study of [**11-6**], there is a
substantial amount of free intraperitoneal gas beneath the
hemidiaphragms. Atelectatic change with possible effusion again
seen at the right base.

CTAP [**2103-11-8**]: 1. Extraluminal oral contrast seen adjacent to a
loop of mid jejunum in the lower mid abdomen, presumably
representing a site of small bowel perforation with resultant
pneumoperitoneum and fluid in the abdomen. 2. Small bowel mural
thickening, presumably related to known diagnosis of celiac
sprue. 3. Large area of mesenteric adenopathy and 'mistiness'.
This finding is unchanged since [**2103-9-11**] and though it
may be related to reactive changes from the known celiac
disease, lymphoma is another consideration and ongoing followup
is recommended as per the previous study. 4. Distended
gallbladder

PATHOLOGY SMALL BOWEL RESECTION [**2103-11-8**]: 1) Small bowel, at 110
cm, resection (A-B, Q-AB): Small bowel segment with multiple
perforations and associated full thickness ulceration, exudative
inflammation and extensive granulation tissue. Adjacent intact
mucosa with extensive villous blunting with increased
intraepithelial lymphocytes consistent with prior history of
refractory celiac disease. Atypical lymphoid infiltrate, refer
to part 2 for further characterization. 2) Small bowel,
resection (C-P, AC-AJ): Small bowel segment with multiple
perforations and associated full thickness ulceration, exudative
inflammation and extensive granulation tissue. Adjacent intact
mucosa with extensive villous blunting with increased
intraepithelial lymphocytes consistent with prior history of
refractory celiac disease. Atypical lymphoid infiltrate, see
note.

PATHOLOGY SMALL BOWEL RESECTION [**2103-11-17**]: Small bowel, resection:
1.  Small intestinal segment with acute and chronic
inflammation, patchy ulceration, focal anastomotic site mucosal
necrosis, prominent submucosal edema, and extensive serositis;
no definitive perforation identified. 2.  Viable margins with
marked edema, focal mucosal ulceration and mild active
inflammation. 3.  Increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, villous
shortening, and crypt hyperplasia, consistent with involvement
by patient's known celiac disease; Paneth cells do not appear
overall decreased in viable mucosal areas.  See hemepath note.
4.  One unremarkable lymph node.

CT Torso [**2103-11-27**]: 1. Bilateral pleural effusions, increased
compared with previous study. 2. Diffuse anasarca and diffusely
abnormal small and large bowel wall thickening consistent with
mucosal edema. Given the diffuse involvement this likely
represents third spacing. 3. Diffuse mesenteric fat stranding
and mesenteric lymphadenopathy. 4. Moderate amount of free fluid
in the pelvis and both paracolic gutters. No discrete localized
fluid collection seen however infection cannot be excluded. 5.
Interval formation of bilateral stomas. 6. Lower abdominal wound
dehiscence. 7. Distended gallbladder. 8. Left inguinal hernia
containing fluid.

CT guided percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement [**2103-11-29**]:
Technically successful percutaneous cholecystostomy tube
placement. Sample sent for microbiology analysis. A total of 200
cc of dark green turbid bile were aspirated.

CT guided percutaneous abdominal fluid collection drainage
[**2103-11-29**]: Technically successful aspiration and drainage
catheter placement right upper quadrant ascitic fluid pocket as
above. 200 cc clear straw-colored fluid were aspirated to bag.

CT Torso [**2103-12-5**]: 1. Stable bilateral pleural effusions. 2. New
diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities, infectious vs.
aspiration. 3. Thickened small and large bowel with surrounding
mesenteric stranding and fluid, relatively unchanged from prior.
4. Stable midline wound with interval resolution of associated
free air and contrast extravasation. Interval resolution of
anterior abdominal fluid collection in the right upper quadrant,
with interv
