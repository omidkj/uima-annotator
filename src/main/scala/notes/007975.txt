Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 87  year-old man with a past medical history of
a.fib (does not currently appear to be on Coumadin), HTN who was
found down near his car and sent from an OSH with a large right
sided intraparenchymal bleed.

All information is obtained solely from EMS and OSH notes as
patient is not responsive and no contact is currently available.

The patient was reported to the police as missing at
3:44 this morning.  He was staying with his sister in [**Name (NI) 8117**],
but
apparently lives somewhere else.  He was found not far from the
house on the ground about 50-75 feet from his car (not clear if
he was driving or this was near the driveway).  Police noted
that
he was supine, was moving his right side, slurring his
speech and saying incoherent things, and not following commands.

In the field he was noted the be very cold ~90-[**Age over 90 **]F, BP was
160/103.    The patient was brought to nearby [**Hospital3 **]
where a CT scan was done that showed a IPH, however no report
was
sent and the CD could not be opened.  The patient was noted to
continue to be cold (one recorded temp in the vitals chart lists
90.9).  At some point he was intubated for "airway protection."
He was then med flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

Here neurosurgery was called and then neurology was called.  The
patient remains intubated and was given a number of fentanyl
boluses for sedation, and his temp was noted to be 94.3 and a
warming blanket was placed on the patient.

On neuro ROS, general ROS not currently available


Past Medical History:
- HTN
- A.fib (was noted in [**2132**] to be on Coumadin at LGH but normal
INR today)
- Rheumatic fever as a child
- b/l inguinal hernia repair 20 years prior


Social History:
Apparently was visiting his sister in [**Name (NI) 8117**].  Is a
Jehovah's Witness and would not want blood transfusions,
otherwise social history an unknown

fentanyl)

spontaneously but less than right.  Does not move left arm to
noxious stimulation

other arm to stim on left arm

Pertinent Results:
EEG [**3-5**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and
disorganization of the background rhythm consistent with a
moderate to
severe encephalopathy. There were sharp waves, at times occuring

periodically at 0.5 to 1 Hz and in short runs, and well as focal
slowing
in the left frontal region indicative of cortical and
subcortical
dysfunction in this region; although no clear clinical correlate
was
demonstrated, some of the sharp waves were noted to be
associated with
movement of the right foot. These findings are consistent with
patient's history of a left frontal hemorrhage. No
electrographic
seizures were seen in this recording. Note is made of an
irregularly
irregular cardiac rhythm with occasional wide complex ectopic
beats.

CT (head) [**3-4**]
Large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated
areas of
vasogenic edema with minimal improvement of leftward shift of
midline
structures. There is small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage and
right
frontal subdural hematoma, essentially unchanged from prior
exam.

CXR: [**3-8**]
Moderately severe pulmonary edema continues to worsen since
[**3-4**]
accompanied by moderate left and small right pleural effusion,
also
increasing, and obscuring cardiac silhouette, probably
moderately enlarged and unchanged. No pneumothorax. Tracheostomy
tube abuts the right tracheal wall and should be evaluated
clinically to see if it is appropriately positioned.  Left
subclavian line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax


Brief Hospital Course:
Right frontal hemorrhage
The patient was admitted after being found down beside his car.
He was initially hypothermic (94 F), but was warmed in the ED.
His exam was notable for minimal responsiveness, no eye opening,
intact brainstem reflexes and some spontaneous movement of the
right arm. He was intubated for airway protection. On HD 2 he
was noted to be following some commands with his right arm.
Family was present and made the decision that they would like to
go forward with care, even if that involved a trach and PEG. The
patient had a tracheostomy and PEG tube placed by the ICU team
and was able to come off of ventilator support to humidified O2
with q4 hour suctioning. During his hospital course he did not
open his eyes to voice or sternal rub.

Seizures
While the patient was in the ED he was noted to have shaking
movements of his right arm. He was loaded with Dilantin - which
was eventually changed over to Keppra at 750 mg [**Hospital1 **]. He had 2
routine bedside EEGs performed which showed moderate
encephalopathy and slowing over the right frontal region in the
region of the IPH.

MSSA pneumonia
The patient had coag + staph aureus that was pan-sensitive
cultured from his sputum on [**2134-3-3**]. He was initially treated
with Vancomycin and Zosyn (on [**2134-3-4**]) and then transitioned to
Nafcillin when sensitivities returned. Total course should be 14
days (end date [**2134-3-18**]).

Nutrition
Patient had a PEG tube placed and was started on tube feeds.

Code Status
Discussion was had with his 2 sisters who made him DNR - but
felt that ventilator assistance would be OK so long as it was
not prolonged.

The patient will be discharged to LTAC. He needs telemetry and
will be transported by ALS.
