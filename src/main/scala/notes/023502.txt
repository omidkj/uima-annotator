DATE OF DEATH:  [**2131-9-5**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 8026**] was a pleasant
80-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery
disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and hypogammaglobinemia, and
liver and brain metastases with unknown primary, who was
initially admitted with a brain metastatic bleed and
resulting seizure disorder.

He was once admitted to the MICU from [**8-16**] to [**8-17**] for acute
respiratory distress which was thought to be secondary to
aspiration pneumonia and he was started on BIPAP and then
weaned to face mask.  He was ruled in also for an MI with a
peak troponin of greater than 50.  We were unable to treat
him due to his metastatic bleed in his brain, so he was given
aspirin and Lopressor.  His aspiration pneumonia was treated
with Zosyn, vancomycin, and Flagyl.

He went to the floor on [**8-17**] and was started on hemodialysis.
However, the next day, he developed peripheral eosinophilia
and urine eosinophilia which was thought to be secondary to
his Zosyn and so he was changed to levofloxacin for one dose.
He also had his Quinton catheter pulled out which he was
using for his hemodialysis on [**8-19**] because an AV fistula was
formed and there was a big left groin hematoma with a drop in
blood pressure.

He also had a likely aspiration event on [**8-20**] with possible
sepsis and the blood loss in his groin hematoma caused him to
become hypotensive.  He was also hypoxic and was found to be
88% on room air.

He was sent to the MICU and he was started on BIPAP, but
intubated on [**8-20**] for airway protection.  He was continued on
levofloxacin, Flagyl, and vancomycin for the presumed line
sepsis and the aspiration pneumonia.  A lot of secretions
were being suctioned out.  A CT angiogram was also done to
rule out for PE, but that time, bilateral pleural effusions
were found.  CT of the abdomen was unremarkable, except for
polycystic kidney disease and liver metastasis.

The patient's sputum grew MRSA and Serratia.  He was being
covered with vancomycin, Bactrim, and Ceptaz, but it was
believed that his eosinophilia was secondary to his multiple
drug interactions.  The patient also developed a drug rash in
his axillary area which was also thought to be secondary to
drug reaction.  In addition, the patient was still spiking
temperatures and, at that time, it was concluded that it
could be secondary to a drug fever due to the use of
ceftriaxone.

Allergy and Immunology were consulted who recommended that
all his antibiotics be stopped and the patient was started on
tobramycin.  The patient was also receiving hemodialysis
three times a week.

Despite all these multiple attempts for medical treatment,
the patient did not show any signs of improvement.  The
patient's blood pressure was volatile/fluctuating up and down
and the patient was repeatedly spiking temperatures.  At that
time, a very detailed family meeting was held between the
attending, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the resident, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8516**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], social worker, and the daughter of Mr. [**Known lastname 8026**],
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 8026**], who was actively involved in his care.

During the family meeting, it was decided that the patient
will be made comfort measures only.  He will remain trached
and we are going to continue some of his medications at this
time and his tube feed and try to make him as comfortable as
possible.  This was decided on [**2131-9-3**].

On [**2131-9-4**], it was decided that we could start slowly weaning
off his medications, except for medications that would keep
him comfortable.  All of his medications, including
Lopressor, aspirin, and other medications he was on, were all
discharged and the patient was kept on an Ativan drip,
Fentanyl drip, and his valproic acid to prevent him from
developing any seizures.  In addition, the antibiotics were
also stopped because, on the family meeting of [**9-3**], it was
decided that the patient will not undergo any more
hemodialysis and, since tobramycin was cleared by the kidney,
all antibiotics were stopped.  The patient's tube feeds were
still continued, but they were decreased from 60 cc per hour
to 10 cc per hour.

On [**2131-9-5**], in the morning, it was decided that we could
slowly start weaning off his trach and moving to pressure
support of 5, PEEP of 5, FIO2 of 21%, in a BIPAP mode and
continue his tube feeds at 10 cc per hour and titrate up the
Fentanyl and the Ativan as needed to make him more
comfortable.  In addition, we can add a morphine drip and
titrate that up, as well, as needed for comfort level.

On [**2131-9-5**] at 7:45 p.m., the patient passed away.  The
patient did not respond to sternal rub or any pain sensation.
Pupils were fixed and dilated and did not respond to any
light.  No breath sounds were heard.  No heart sounds were
heard.

At that time, the attending, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], was notified
regarding the death of Mr. [**Known lastname 8026**].  In addition, his primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14069**], was also notified about his
expiration.

In addition, his daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 8026**], who was actively
involved in his medical care, was also notified regarding her
father's death.  She refused any autopsy.
