History of Present Illness:
This patient is an 88 year old male with a remote history of
atrial fibrillation and cardiac risk factors including
hypertension and dyslipidemia.  He was referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7756**] by
his primary care provider for evaluation of recent squeezing
exertional chest pain radiating down his left arm. He denied
palpitations, shortness of breath, or peripheral edema.

A stress test by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7756**] was inconclusive so the patient was
sent for a nuclear study on [**2125-2-9**] which was positive for
inferior ischemia per Dr.[**Last Name (un) **] note of [**2125-2-12**]. A
cardiac catheterization revealed multi-vessel disease and he was
referred for surgery.

[**3-3**]:
PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in
comparison to [**3-2**], [**2124**].

Heart size and mediastinum are enlarged, unchanged. The lungs
are essentially
clear. Minimal bilateral pleural effusions are noted. Anterior
loculated
pneumothorax is better appreciated on the lateral view, minimal.
Loculations
of pleural effusion along the left chest wall are demonstrated,
reflecting
post-surgical changes.

TEE:[**2-27**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There
is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Post bypass
The patient is s/p 2 Vessel bypass [**Doctor Last Name **] partial mitral
annuloplasty
The patient is on a neosynephrine drip
The ejection fraction is preserved at >55%
A well seated annuloplasty ring is seen with no
peri/paravalvular leaks
The mean gradient across the valve is 3mmhg
All the other valves are similar to prebypass with no change

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91826**] was a same day admit and on [**2-27**] he was brought to
the Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
graft x 3 and mitral valve repair. Please see operative report
for surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to
the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated.
On post-op day one he was started on beta-blockers and
diuretics. Later that day he was transferred to the floor for
further care. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol. Physical Therapy worked with patient for
strength and mobility. Post-op he complained of some numbness on
the left side of his tongue associated with hoarseness. He was
seen by ENT. Patinet was noted to have left TVC immobility and
left base of tongue edema/ecchymosis. The patient's airway was
widely patent, he had a large glottic gap.  The etiology of this
vocal cord immobility is unclear at this time and could be due
to tension placed on the RLN intraoperatively, subluxation of
the arytenoid during intubation. The patient's tongue discomfort
and difficulty lateralizing to the left was likely due to the
prominent area of ecchymosis and edema at the BOT. Diet
modifions were made to accommodate his slight swallowing
problems. [**Name (NI) **] will need to f/u with ENT in [**12-11**] weeks. He
developed postoperative a-fib not well rate controlled and his
betablocker was titrated as tolerated. Coumadin was initiated
and his INR was therapeutic at discharge. He was seen by the
physical therapy department and at the time of discharge on POD
#8 he was deemed safe for discharge to home with VNA services.
Discharge instructions and f/u appointments arranged.
