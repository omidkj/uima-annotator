[**2156-4-27**] BCx: No growth as of [**2156-5-2**]
[**2156-4-27**] UCx: <10,000 organisms/mL
[**2156-4-28**] MRSA Screen: Negative

ECG [**2156-4-27**]: Sinus tachycardia and frequent ventricular ectopy

CXR [**2156-4-27**]: Left basilar opacity concerning for pneumonia.
Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure
interval resolution.

CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST [**2156-4-28**]:
CHEST:
- There is almost complete consolidation of the left lower lobe
with an
associated small simple left parapneumonic effusion. The
superior segment
bronchus of the left lower lobe is minimally narrowed between an
area of
periaortic atelectasis and the upper segment pulmonary artery
(2:24).
- There is no evidence of a hilar mass causing this narrowing.
- No evidence of pulmonary or pleural abscess formation. The
remainder of the lungs appears clear.
- There are multiple lower paratracheal enlarged lymph nodes,
measuring up to 12 cm in short axis (2:19). There is a
subcarinal lymph node, measuring 11 mm in short axis (2:25) and
a 10 mm aortopulmonary window lymph node.
- There is no hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.
- There is no pericardial effusion. Moderate calcification of
the aortic arch and the aortic valve.
- The pulmonary artery is enlarged, measuring 3.4 cm at the
bifurcation
consistent with pulmonary hypertension.

PARTIALLY VISUALIZED ABDOMEN: There are multiple hypoattenuating
lesions in
the right and left liver lobe, the largest measuring 10 mm at
the liver dome, too small to charactize.

BONES: There is a compression fracture of the T7 thoracic
vertebral body, of indeterminate age, and a small bone island at
the T10 vertebral body. There is diffuse osteopenia of the bony
structure of the thorax.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe consolidation, consistent with infectious
pneumonia in the setting of acute fever and cough. Small
parapneumonic effusion. No evidence of abscess formation. Follow
up CXR in four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy is
recommended.
2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is likely reactive in nature.
3. Compression fracture of the T7 vertebral body is of
indeterminate age.
4. Multiple hypoattenuating liver lesions are too small to
characterize size, but statistically most likely represent cysts
or hemangiomas.
5. Enlarged pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old woman presents with high fever with 3wks of cough
unresponsive to Cipro, CXR with LLL infiltrates, CT Chest with
LLL PNA and small parapneumonic effusion.  Pt has associated
left pleuritic chest pain from the PNA.  CT Chest with contrast
without evidence for PE.  Pt initially admitted to the ICU for
relative hypotension, but responded very well to IV fluids and
antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn/Levaquin).  The patient was transferred
to the floor in good condition.  Antibiotics were quickly weaned
down to Levofloxacin alone.  Her condition incrementally
improved over the next few days with decreasing symptoms.  She
was ambulating with a cane and her left pleuritic CP was much
decreased on the day of discharge.

PROBLEM LIST:
1. [**Name2 (NI) **] with small paraneumonic effusion: Pt will finish
Levofloxacin to complete a total of 8 days of antibiotics.
Tylenol and Guaifenesin prescribed as needed for symptoms.
Blood cx without growth to date on the day of discharge.  Sputum
and Viral cultures were inconclusive [**1-6**] poor sample quality.
In any case, the patient's symptoms did respond well to
treatment.  Recommend follow up CXR in [**3-9**] weeks to ensure full
resolution of PNA.

2. HYPERTENSION, BENIGN:  When BP improved, restarted home
amlodipine.

3. GERD:  Continue prevacid

4. OSTEOPOROSIS w/ COMPRESSION FRACTURE:  Noted on CT scan. Have
recommended f/u with PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) 4565**] to consider
bisphosophonate therapy.
