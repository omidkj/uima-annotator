Allergies:
Lactose

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
cough, SOB, fevers


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement of right IJ central line

History of Present Illness:
75 year old woman with mixed connective tissue disease with
features of scleroderma (on chronic prednisone), ILD, trigeminal
neuralgia, esophageal dysmotility, HTN, and diastolic CHF, who
presents with 2 days of fatigue, non-productive cough, and
subjective fevers. Has also been feeling more SOB. Denies
headache, neck pain, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, or dysuria.
.
In the ED initial VS were 102.8, 138, 141/60, 30, 93% on RA.
Exam notable for bibasilar rales, benign abdominal exam. Labs
notable for WBC 18.9 (90% PMNs), lactate 6.1, trop 0.12 -> 0.14,
UA neg. EKG with STD laterally, though resolved with decreasing
HR. CXR showed small right pleural effusion, mild pulmonary
edema, possible pneumonia. Patient was given vanc/zosyn for
suspected pneumonia, ASA 325mg, hydrocortisone 100mg, and 1L NS
and repeat lactate was 2.6. She remained borderline hypotensive
with MAPs 55-60 so a right IJ was placed and patient was started
on levophed. She received a total of 2.5L NS. CT abd/pelvis was
performed and patient was transferred to the MICU for further
evaluation.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is comfortable and states
that her breathing is improved and she is feeling more
comfortable.

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2122-6-20**] BLOOD CULTURE X 2: Pending
[**2122-6-20**] URINE CULTURE:  Negative
.
IMAGING:
CXR PORTABLE AP [**2122-6-20**] 11:00:  Mild pulmonary vascular
congestion and small right pleural effusion, possibly
exaggerated by low lung volumes or slightly worse compared to
[**2122-1-2**].  Right base consolidation/ infection cannot be
excluded.
.
CXR PORTABLE AP [**2122-6-20**] 14:43:  There are low lung volumes due
to poor inspiratory effort.  There is prominence of the
pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of pulmonary edema.
There is also a right-sided pleural effusion and a developing
left retrocardiac opacity.  Heart size is upper limits of normal
but stable.  No pneumothoraces are seen.
.
CXR PORTABLE AP [**2122-6-20**] 16:25:
There is a right IJ central line with distal lead tip at the
cavoatrial junction.  Heart size is again seen enlarged.  There
is prominence of the pulmonary vascular marking suggestive of
moderate pulmonary edema.  There is a right-sided pleural
effusion.  There is a wide vascular pedicle.  No pneumothoraces
are seen.
.
CT CHEST [**2122-6-20**]:
1.  Superimposed consolidation within the lower lobes
bilaterally on a background of pulmonary fibrotic changes.  This
may represent superimposed pneumonia or aspiration.
2.  Bilateral atelectasis within the dependent portions of the
upper lobes which along with the lower lobe consolidation limits
identification of previously noted bilateral pulmonary nodules.
3.  Stable enlarged left supraclavicular lymph nodes.
4.  Coronary artery calcifications.
5.  Patulous esophagus with fluid within the upper esophagus
which places the patient at risk for aspiration.
6.  Bilateral hypodense thyroid nodules which could be further
evaluated with thyroid ultrasound on a nonurgent basis if not
previously performed.
.
VIDEO SWALLOW [**2122-6-22**]:  Essentially normal pharyngeal swallow
with one episode of penetration with thin liquids.




Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old woman with mixed connective tissue disease with
features of scleroderma (on chronic prednisone), ILD, HTN, and
diastolic CHF, admitted with bilateral pneumonia complicated by
hypotension, now improving.
.
# Pneumonia/Sepsis:  Patient with bilateral infiltrates on CT,
dyspnea and hypoxia on admission.  She was found to be in sepsis
on admission, and was briefly placed on levophed.  With
initiation of vancomycin and zosyn, respiratory symptoms
improved and hypotension resolved.  She was narrowed to
ceftriaxone/azithro, and continued to have stable vital signs
and breath comfortably.  She was transferred to the medical
floor.
