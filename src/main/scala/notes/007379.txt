Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter placement

History of Present Illness:
80M HTN, Dementia, recent diagnosis of suspected metastatic
disease (unknown primary), 5 weeks diarrhea, hx of facial
melanoma presents to the ED following a liver biopsy.
.
The patient presented to his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 74756**] (Atrius) in
early [**2196-7-10**] with complaints of intermittent diarrhea,
nausea and vomitting. The patient was suspected to be suffering
from diverticulitis given LLQ discomfort and he was given 1 week
of abx. With no resolution of symptoms from the antibiotics the
patient underwent a CT abdomen that revelaed multiple nodules
within his liver as well as an IPMN of his pancreas which was
confirmed on MRI.
The patient re-presented to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2196-8-8**] where he was
found to be orthostatic and was given 2L of D5NS which resolved
his orthostasis. Na noted to be 129.  He was noted to have
normal LFTs (ALT 28, AST 21) and hypoalbuminemia 3.1). At that
time a plan for outpatient liver bx was performed.
.
At 9:30 this morning the patient underwent an ultrasound guided
liver biopsy. Per report there were no complications. 5 minutes
post procedure the pt reported chest pain [**7-19**] substernal chest
pain with radiation to the back. This pain was not reponsive
either oxycodone or dilaudid.
.
In the ED, initial vs 97 56 160/70 16 100. Initial exam notable
for right basilar crackles, distended non tender abdomen.
Initial labs notable for Hct 36.9, Na 130, Plts 207, INR 1.1.
The patient continued to complain of chest pain. At 11:30am he
was noted to have an SBP of 145. He recieved 4 of IV Morphine at
12:40. The patient continued to note pain and was given SL Nitro
at 12:43 at which time he was triggered for SBP in 60s in both
arms. The patient received a total of 2.5L while in the ED and
then underwent CXR, CTA Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis. CT Head did not
reveal large mass. The pt was found to have bilateral PEs and
started on a Heparin gtt, but then the patient had a drop in
hematocrit.
.
After discussion with the vascular and general surgery teams,
the heparin gtt was discontinued and an IVC filter was placed by
general surgery, the heparin gtt was not restarted, with the
thought of waiting 48 hours post procedure to reduce the risk of
bleeding. His blood pressure improved overnight and he received
2 units PRBC's and then his hematocrit remained stable so he was
called out to the floor. Prior to be transferred to the floor he
flipped into A.fib with a rate in the 120's to 130's, which was
new for him, he received 5mg IV metoprolol with an improvement
in her HR to 100's, with a stable BP.
.
Upon arrival to the floor initial VS were: 116/60, 115, 17, 96%
on 2LNC. He continues to complain of shoulder pain, and has
abdominal pain with movement. Denies any chest pain, pleuritic
pain or fever/chills.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, Denies headache, sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough, shortness of
breath, or wheezing. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes

Vitals: T: BP: P: R: 18 O2:
General: AOX3, Squinting in pain with turning. Otherwise NAD

Lungs: bilateal dry crackles at bases but otherwise clear
without focal rales, wheezes or rhonchi,
CV: Brady, RRR, S1 + S2, No appreciable loud P2 or RV heave.
Otherwise cannot appreciate murmurs, rubs, gallops
Abdomen: soft, distended, tender, worse in RUQ, bowel sounds
present.
GU: + Foley
Ext: warm, no appreciable cord. LLE with ecchymosis along medial
aspect of leg. Trace bilateral pedal edema.

Pertinent Results:
LENIs [**2196-8-17**]
1.Thrombosis within the right popliteal (partially occlusive),
as well as
the right tibial and peroneal veins.
2.Thrombosis of the left peroneal veins.
.
CT head [**2196-8-17**]
1. No evidence of intracranial metastasis on this non-contrast
study. If
there is clinical concern for intracranial metastatic disease,
an MRI of the brain with and without intravenous contrast is
recommended.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: Incidentally noted are
degenerative changes of the cervical spine with anterolisthesis
of C2 on C3 and C4 on C5, with retrolisthesis of C3 on C4.
.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2196-8-17**]
1. Right pulmonary emboli and possibly left pulmonary embolism,
as above.
Concern for early right heart strain. Suggest correlation with
echocardiogram.
2. No evidence of acute aortic dissection. Eccentric mural
thrombus with
possible small focus of ulcerated plaque at the aortic arch.
3. Extensive marked mediastinal lymphadenopathy(lymph nodes
measure up to 5 cm),left pulmonary nodularity, as above, and
associated left pleural effusion raise high concern for
metastasis.
4. Small amount of slightly high density perisplenic fluid,
which tracks into the pelvis with trace pelvic fluid, most
likely relates to patient's recent liver biopsy. Ill-defined
hypodensity within the liver, not well assessed, but new since
the prior study, may relate to biopsy with possible intrahepatic
hemorrhage. No active extravasation seen.
5. Lucency in T11 vertebral body of indeterminate age, given
history of
metastatic melanoma, metastasis is not excluded. If further
evaluation
warranted, consider bone scan.
6. Mild compression of the superior endplate of T12 vertebral
body of
indeterminate age.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course: 80M with HTN, Dementia presenting with chest pain
following liver biopsy and found to have bilateral PEs on exam
and hypotension.
.
# Hypotension: occured secondary to receiving nitroglycerin and
IV morphine for treatment of chest pain. He was bolused with 2.5
liters of normal saline. The patient also likely bled into the
liver biopsy site after being started on anticoagulation (see
above CT abdomen report). His hematocrit dropped from 36.9 to
29.3. He was trasnfused one unit of PRBCs and demonstrated an
appropriate response.
.
# Submassive Bilateral Pulmonary Embolism: After a non-cont
