Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from OSH with bilateral SDH for neurosurgical
evaluation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
79 yo M with largely unknown PMH presents from [**Location (un) **] ED with
bilateral SDH and midline shift for neurosurgical evaluation. He
presented to [**Location (un) **] ED following a mechanical fall at home in
his bedroom this am. EMS was called and found him lethargic and
bradycardic. He was taken to [**Location (un) **] ED where he was noted to
have worsening mental status and was intubated for airway
protection without sedation needed. CT scan of his head was
performed which reportedly demonstrated bilateral SDH with
midline shift and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for neurosurg
eval. Prior to transfer, he did receive 0.5mg atropine for
bradycardia.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T: 98.8 BP: 140/60 HR: 60 RR: 14
O2 sat: 99% on Vent settings: 500/14/5/1.00. GCS was 3T, pupils
fixed and dilated. Repeat head CT large right subdural hematoma
with marked mass effect and 17 mm subfalcine herniation, small
left posterior parietal subdural hematoma, and uncal herniation
with deformity of the brainstem. Neurosurgery was consulted and
upon review of his images, recommended, "no neurosurgical
intervention indicated at this time, findings are incompatible
with life." He received 0.5mg atropine for bradycardia, but it
is not clearly documented how low his HR dropped. His wife would
like their sons to be able to see their father and they will be
traveling from [**State 7080**] and [**State 531**].
.
Of note, wife reports he was recently admitted to [**Hospital 11373**] for "delirium" and black stool at which time he was
found to have UGIB requiring 7 Units prbcs. During that
admission, wife reports patient had a "heart attack" and was
started on several new medications for "congestive heart
failure". She also notes increased confusion over the past [**2-12**]
months and trouble word finding. He had a fall nearly 1 month
ago at which time he hit the back of his head, but was
discharged home from the ED at that time; it is unclear if he
had imaging then. He has had no additional falls since then
until this am.
.
Additionally, his wife reports a recent diagnosis of "aplastic
anemia" (although one piece of medical information she has
reports myelodysplasia) for which he was undergoing chemo under
the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He had been requiring frequent prbc
transfusions throughout.

Social History:
Lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 60509**], [**Name (NI) **]. Quit smoking years ago, but
previously smoked "heavily". Also used to "like his beer"
although unclear amount consumed; has not been drinking in
years. No h/o illicits. One son lives in [**Name (NI) 7080**] and one
son lives in upstate NY.

[**2116-11-13**] CT HEAD - FINDINGS: There is a 13 x 3.6 cm subdural
hematoma abutting the left frontal
and parietal and into the left temporal regions inferiorly.
There is 17mm
subfalcine herniation. There is marked vasogenic edema, with
mass effect on
the frontal, lateral and temporal horns of the left lateral
ventricle. There
is blood within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral
ventricle. There is
also small right posterior parietal sub-dural hematoma. There
are no
fractures. The right maxillary sinus shows marked mucosal
thickening. There
are vascular calcifications.

IMPRESSION: Large right subdural hematoma with marked mass
effect and 17 mm
subfalcine herniation. Small left posterior parietal subdural
hematoma.There
is uncal herniation with deformity of the brainstem. Findings
posted to the ED
dashboard at the time of the study.



Brief Hospital Course:
79yo M with h/o myelodysplasia, recent UGIB, s/p recent MI
presents following mechanical fall with SDH and herniation s/p
intubation at OSH.
.
# The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical
evaluation of a large left subdural hematoma. He was evaluated
by neurosurgery in the emergency room and was found to be
unresponsive with GCS 3T and pupils fixed and dilated. Repeat CT
head demonstrated a large left subdural hematoma with uncal and
subfalacine herniation. His findings were felt to be unamenable
to surgical intervention and incompatible with life. After
extensive discussion with the patient's wife, he was admitted to
the MICU. Although she was not yet ready to extubate the
patient, she wished only to make her husband comfortable. She
was understanding that despite keeping him ventilated, he could
experience arrhythmia or bradycardia due to his intracranial
process that could be life threatening. The evening of admission
the patient sustained a cardiac arrest and expired.
