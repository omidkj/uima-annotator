Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Slurred speech

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2173-3-18**]: Mid-line placed R arm

History of Present Illness:
87yoF with multiple medical problems including atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin, dCHF (EF >70%), DM, CRI (Stage III)
who presented to OSH with slurred speech, found to have right
occipital and right cerebellar infarcts with hemorrhagic
transformation of both infarcts.  The pt had normal speech on
[**3-10**] at 3 a.m. when she spoke to her husband when he got up to
the bathroom.  When her husband woke her at 8 a.m., her speech
was slurred, as if she were drunk. EMS was called and she was
taken to [**Location (un) 16843**].
.
At [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital, she was judged as somnolent.  Laboratory
data was significant for WBC 11.6, INR 1.36, creatinine 1.35,
A1c 6.9, cholesterol 160, triglycerides 107 and LDL 102, digoxin
1.1. Chest x-ray with mild pulmonary edema, BNP 316.  TSH
described as normal range. EKG showed t-wave inversion
laterally and in leads II and III with flat cardiac enzymes.
.
Given concern for CVA, an aspirin was given, Neurology
consulted, and MRI planned for the afternoon of [**3-11**], Coumadin
was restarted. Of note, Digoxin level was 1.1 and she was noted
to be in afib with adequate rate control. BNP increased to 838
on [**3-11**]. She was hypertensive and was treated with metoprolol
and increased amlodipine. At about 14:30 on [**3-11**] she was noted
to be unresponsive per nursing notes. Stat non-contrast head CT
was ordered and Coumadin held at ~ 5:30 p.m. She was found to
have the right occipital and right cerebellar infarcts with
hemorrhagic transformation and the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further managment.

      Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.

Studies:
CT head [**3-12**]: No interval change from [**2173-3-11**] of a right
occipital and cerebellar infarction with associated hemorrhagic
components.
.
CXR PA/LAT [**3-13**]:
There are bilateral pleural effusions, which are moderate in
size, right side worse than left. Left retrocardiac opacity is
again seen. There is also prominence of the pulmonary
interstitial markings, which is stable. Calcification in
thoracic aorta is present.
.
.
CTA Chest [**3-16**]:
1. No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Prominent central pulmonary arteries are suggestive of
pulmonary
hypertension.
3. Marked coronary artery disease and atherosclerotic plaques
along the aorta.
4. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right worse than left,
with adjacent atelectasis.
5. Ground-glass opacities compatible with fluid overload, but
also suspicious for superimposed infection.
.
Portable CXR [**3-19**]:
Large right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has
worsened. This intensifies the severity of edema in the right
lung and may account for apparent upper lobe consolidation but
followup is recommended to exclude right upper lobe pneumonia.
Large heart is substantially obscured by leural fluid, but no
better than it was on [**3-16**]. Mediastinal veins and the hila
are still dilated. No pneumothorax.
.
AP/Lat CXR [**3-23**]:
Improvement of pleural effusion and marked pulmonary congestion
on this followup examination. Both lung fields can now be
identified and do not show any acute local infiltrates.
.
Cards:
[**3-12**] ECG:
Atrial fibrillation. Left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary
repolarization abnormalities. Q waves in the anteroseptal leads
could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy, although old
anteroseptal myocardial infarction cannot be excluded. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

[**3-20**] ECG:
Atrial fibrillation. Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction of
indeterminate age. Inferior and lateral ST-T wave changes may be
due to myocardial infarction or left ventricular hypertrophy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2173-3-15**] the findings are
similar.
.
[**2173-3-12**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is mild functional mitral stenosis
(mean gradient 4mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.


Brief Hospital Course:
87yoF with multiple medical problems including atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin, dCHF, DM, CRI who presented to OSH
with slurred speech, found to have right PCA embolic stroke with
hemorrhagic transformation.  The [**Hospital **] hospital course was
complicated by worsening dCHF, persistent hypoxia and R  >>> L
pleural effusions. Clinical status improved with aggresive
diuresis.
.
#) CVA
The patient underwent CT head for her slurred speech and was
found to have the right occipital and right cerebellar infarcts
with small hemorrhagic transformation of both infarcts. The
infarcts are believed to be cardioembolic secondary to atrial
fibrillation, as her INR was found to be sub-therapeutic at 1.36
at [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital where she first presented [**3-10**]. Given
concern for CVA, an a
