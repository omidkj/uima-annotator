Hypoglycemia, change in mental status

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4049**] [**Known lastname 102494**] is a 71 year old morbidly obese male with a PMH
of multiple cardiovascular risk factors including HTN, HL, DM2
on insulin, ongoing cocaine use, with known [**Known lastname **] s/p stents to
LAD and RCA, prior stroke with residual right sided weakness,
and multiple pulmonary co-morbidities including COPD, OSA,
chronic diastolic and systolic CHF (EF 50%), and pulmonary
hypertension who was found down in apartment today by family. On
EMS arrival, his blood sugar and it was 61. No IV access able to
be obtained in the field, so he got 2mg of IM glucagon en route.
Also reportedly had some respiratory distress so got nebulizers
as well.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.3 70 121/73 26 90%RA. On exam, he
was agitated and in extremis, then very lethargic, but quickly
improved with BiPAP, much more communicative. No ABG was
obtained. Fingerstick was notable for hypoglycemia to 64. He was
given 1 amp d50, on re-check was FSG 67, so received 2nd amp.
Mental status improved with these interventions. Labs showed WBC
count of 4.9, normal creatinine 1.0, CK 86, Tn 0.02. U/A was
dirty. Urine tox positive for cocaine. EKG showed NSR with 1st
degree block with prolonged [**Known lastname 5937**], TWI in I,aVL, and precordial
leads, all stable from prior tracings. CT head was not performed
due to rapid improvement in mental status with the other
interventions. CXR showed possible vascular congestion, no focal
consolidation. Blood and urine cultures were sent, and he was
given 20mg lasix for congested CXR, and 750mg levofloxacin "for
UTI", and was admitted to the ICU given ongoing use of BiPAP.
Access is 2 PIVs, 20g and 18g.

On arrival to the floor, he is not on BiPAP but rather on O2 via
nasal cannula. The patient's FSG is 46, but he is alert and
oriented
x3, appropriate. The patient is somewhat unclear on what
happened but he does report poor PO intake for 1 week with some
diarrhea last week. He has been using his long acting insulin
consistently. No fevers or chills, but he endorses a cough for
the last month and some dysuria and occasional hematuria. He
denies chest pain but states that he is short of breath with
minimal exertion, which is his baseline. He notes LE edema "on
and off." Has been using his baseline 2 pillows. No dietary
indiscretions or medication nonadherence. He admits to cocaine
use at a party over the weekend.

Of note the patient was admitted in [**2-/2148**] for AMS and
hypoglycemia. He has also had multiple ER visits for
hypoglycemia, usually improved with juice and crackers. He had a
similar admission [**2-13**] for lethargy and AMS that was improved
after hypoglycemia resolved.

CT head
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or
major vascular territory infarction. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. Confluent areas of bilateral
hypodensity in the subcortical and periventricular white matter
likely represents sequelae of small vessel
ischemic disease. Prominence of the ventricles and sulci
represents a mild
degree of generalized atrophy. There are calcifications of the
bilateral
carotid siphons.

As compared to the prior examination, fluid within the left
maxillary sinus
appears new. There is mild ethmoid air cell mucosal thickening.
No
concerning osseous lesion is seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells and fluid within
the left
maxillary sinus could represent acute sinusitis.

[**5-6**]
CXR
PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The study is limited by
respiratory motion and patient's inability to lift his head for
the radiograph, thus obscuring the lung apices and the thoracic
inlet.

The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged, unchanged. The
thoracic aortic contour remains tortuous. No overt pulmonary
edema is seen. Ill-defined airspace opacity in the right lung
base was present previously. No definite large pneumothorax or
pleural effusion seen. No displaced fracture noted.
Gas is seen within a relatively distended stomach.

IMPRESSIONS: Little change since [**2148-2-6**] with ill-defined opacity
in the right lung base, which could represent infection,
aspiration, or atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old male with h/o DM2 on insulin and multiple
presentations for hypoglycemia and AMS, also with [**Month/Day/Year **], OSA,
COPD, found down in his house with hypoglycemia and altered
mental status, +coccaine, initially admitted to
