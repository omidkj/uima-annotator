Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was not  responsive to verbal or noxious stimuli.
There is no spontaneous movements. His pupils are asymmetric and
unreactive bilaterally. He does have gag but no other brainstem
function found. There is no movement even to noxious stim.
There is biceps and [**Last Name (un) **] reflexes with down going toes.
Patient had repeat head CT that shows worsened SDH with
subfalcine herniation,transtentorial and uncal herniation. Given
 the hemorrhage, most likely traumatic exacerbated by
anticoagulation. Given the severity of the hemorrhage with his
mass effect/herniation and poor exam, prognosis grim and
surgical and medical intervention appear futile at this point.
Outcomes was discussed with the family and given patient's
wishes, goal of care is to maximize comfort. Patient also
cleared per trauma while in ED. He was admitted to the
neurosurgery service, he was extubated and quickly passed away.
