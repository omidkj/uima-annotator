Date of Birth:  [**2057-6-27**]        Sex:  F

Service:  Neurosurgery


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
woman with the sudden onset of a headache who then fell to
the ground.  She was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where she
was awake, alert and oriented times three.  At 1:00 p.m. her
mental status declined, and she was intubated.  A head
computer tomography showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage.  She
was given Mannitol, vecuronium, Versed, and labetalol and
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, arthritis, myocardial
infarction, and congestive heart failure. .

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had
corneal, gag, and localized to pain in the right side greater
than the left, and withdrew her lower extremities.  Her toes
were downgoing bilaterally.  She was afebrile, her pulse was
69, her blood pressure was 165/117, her respiratory rate was
25, and her saturations were 100 percent.  Her eyes were
closed.  The neck was supple.  She had no carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  Her chest x-ray showed no
infiltrate.

Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with ST
elevations.

A noncontrast head computer tomography showed a subarachnoid
hemorrhage (right greater than left) with blood in the basal
cisterns.

A computer tomography showed a left middle  cerebral artery
aneurysm next to the clip site.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Neurologically, her eyes were
closed.  Her pupils were 6 mm down to 4 mm and reactive.  She
had positive doll's eyes.  Her face was symmetric.  She had
corneal and gag.  She localized in the left upper extremity
at 3/5 and on the right [**2-23**].  Sensation was intact to light
touch.  Her reflexes were [**3-22**] throughout.  The toes were
upgoing.

On [**2136-5-27**] the patient opened her eyes to voice.  The
pupils were 3 mm down to 2 mm and reactive.  She was
localizing to pain in all four extremities.  She was
following commands.  Squeezing right greater than left.  On
[**5-27**], she underwent an angiogram which showed a left
internal carotid artery aneurysm with an occlusion of the
right internal carotid artery.  The patient had an occluded
right internal carotid artery, occluded left subclavian with
subclavian seal syndrome, and poor collateral circulation.

On [**5-28**], the patient underwent an angiographic stent and
coiling.  However, it was not possible to deploy the stent
due to the patient's tortuous vessels and aneurysm morphology.

Vascular Surgery was consulted on [**2136-5-30**] as the patient
had lost both pulses in her lower extremities.  She was taken
emergently to the Operating Room for a thrombectomy and
postoperatively had dopplerable dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibial pulses bilaterally.  The patient had good pulses in
her lower extremities on postoperative day one, however, the
patient did drop her pressure and then lost the pulses in her
lower extremities.

The family approached the physicians in the Intensive Care
Unit regarding making the patient comfortable given the
patient's poor prognosis.  The patient was extubated, and the
patient passed away on [**2136-5-31**].
