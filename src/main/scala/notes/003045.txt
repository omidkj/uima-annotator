Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
groin hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with 2 Cypher stents to RCA and LAD


History of Present Illness:
75F with HTN, ex smoker who developed substernal chest pressure
and discomfort and burping. Patient went to [**Hospital3 **]
hospital where an EKG noted TWI on EKG, serial Troponins of
0.05, 0.43, 0.28, and ECHO showed an EF of 40%. Patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization for symptoms of
unstable angina & MI.
.
Patient underwent catheterization this am with the following
intervention: Cypher stent to the RCA and Cypher stent to the
LAD.
.
Post cath the patient felt nauseous, lightheaded, was found to
have SBP in 70's. Patient was bleeding from the groin, pressure
was held for 45 minutes. Hct @ 11:00 am was 28, baseline Hct is
34.


Past Medical History:
Other Past History:
HTN
Dyslipidemia
Rheumatoid Arthritis
s/p CCY
s/p cataract removal
Osteoporosis


Social History:

Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse. .


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 108/48 mm Hg while seated. Pulse was 79
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and
time. The patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma, there were pale conjunctiva. There was
no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple
with JVP of 1cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed large R-sided groin hematoma extending proximally
to the umbilical ligamet and distally to the upper thigh. There
was no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 1 PT 1

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2155-4-25**] 1:39 PM
IMPRESSION: Extensive superficial soft tissue stranding
consistent with blood dissecting around the fat planes and
muscles in the right inguinal region extending mid way down the
right thigh without discrete collection identified. No
retroperitoneum hematoma.
.
FEMORAL VASCULAR US  [**2155-4-25**] 1:37 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Infiltration of the subcutaneous soft tissues of the right
groin consistent with hematoma formation.
2. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula.
.
 C.CATH Study Date of [**2155-4-25**]
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 2
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA and LCx had no
angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.  The LAD had a
90%
eccentric stenosis after S1.  The RCA had a subtotal occlusion
of the
mid-vessel.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressure with a BP of 121/65 mmHg.
3. Successful PCI/stent to mid LAD with a 2.5x13mm Cypher stent
deployed
to 14atms. Normal flow and no residual stenosis.
4. Successful PCI/stent to mid RCA with a 2.5x13mm Cypher stent
postdilated with a 2.5mm Quantum Maverick balloon. Normal flow
with no
residual stenosis.
5. Delayed failure of Angioseal closure device with development
of large
groin haematoma which was stabilized with manual compression.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI/stent to mid LAD with a Cypher stent.
3. Successful PCI/stent to mid RCA with a Cypher stent.
4. Delayed failure of Angioseal closure device stablized with
manual
compression.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2155-4-26**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity  size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction  with hypokinesis of the mid-
and distal anterior septum (in the distribution  of the LAD).
The apex is probably hypokinetic, but is not fully visualized.
The other segments contract normally. Right ventricular chamber
size and free  wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but  aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral  valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic  hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
consistent  with coronary artery disease. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
75F with NSTEMI at OSH, admitted to CCU with R groin hematoma
with hypotension s/p catheterization.
.
#. Right Groin Hematoma - Patient with groin hematoma not
susceptible to compression.  Patient also hypotensive, thus was
started on Dopamine gtt and given a total of 3U of pRBC for
intravascular support.  Patient remained on the dopamine for <24
hours as her BP stabilized.  With imaging, (official results
above) patient did not have an RP bleed, or
pseudoaneurysm/fistulazation femoral vessels.  Vascular Surgery
assessed the patient and with the imaging, was not deemed to be
a surgical candidate.  Clinically the patient stabilized quickly
and her Hct remained stable upon discharge.
.
#. CAD - Patient was continue plavix/ASA, and a statin was
started.  cardiac enzymes were cycled and objectively the
patient did not have myocardial ischemia.
#. Pump - Patient was restarted on  Atenolol 50' prior to
discharge without event.
#. Rhythm - Patient monitored on telemetry without event.
.
#. Rheumatoid Arthritis - Patient restarted on Prednisone 2.5'
prior to discharge.
.
.
After discussion with the patient and the medical staff, all
were in agreement that [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] was a suitable candidate
for discharge.
