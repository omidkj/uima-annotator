Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracenteses x2
Pleurex catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
60 y/o female with recently dx metastatic breast presents with
fatige and SOB. Last chemo was 3 days ago (paclitaxel. Sudden
onset of SOB over 1.5 days prior to admission. No F/C, no cough,
no chest or abd pain. No sick contacts. + orthopnea. She has not
had further thoracentesis or paracentesis performed since
discharge.
.
She was originally sent to [**Hospital3 **] where labs were
collected and she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] without intervention. Her BP
was 100s/70s, HR 100s and 96% on 3.5 L.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED T 98.2, HR 118, BP 102/67, 15, 98% on
4L NC. After arrival she desated to 64% on RA. Her oxygen
requirement increased to non-rebreather. On exam she has
decreased BL BS and dullness to purcussion. CXR showed L > R
pleural effision and possible RLL PNA. EKG showed sinus tach and
RBBB of unclear chronicity. Labs significant for WBC of .6 with
ANC of 420. She was started on Vanco and Cefepime. She had
transient hypotension to 92/55. She received 2L of NS. VS prior
to transfer HR 107, BP 105/67, R 14, 100% Non Re-breather. ED
talked with pt regaurding code status and confirmed that pt is
DNR/DNI but that she would be ok with non-invasive ventilation.
Pt with exsisting double lumen port for access.
.
She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 **] from [**1-1**] to [**2137-1-18**] after
presenting to on OSH with abd pain and a right adnexal mass with
ascites. Gastric bx confirmed dx of metastatic breast ca and she
was started on paclitaxel. She developed BL pleural effusions
which required thoracentesis x 2 (lasat [**2137-1-15**] for 1200cc).
Cytology confirmed it is a malignant effusion. She was empiric
treated for SBP at the OSH although para later in the [**Hospital1 **] course
was not consistent with infection.
.
On arrival to the floor she is drowsy but arousable and
oriented.

.
Stool C-diff negative x 3
.
Blood, urine, and pleural fluid cultures: negative
.
Left Pleural Fluid for cell block; C11-3953A
DIAGNOSIS:
Left pleural fluid, cell block:
  Positive for malignant cells, consistent with metastatic
adenocarcinoma.
.
Cardiac Echo Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 60%). A sessile 12 by 16 mm globular apical mass is
seen in the left ventricle. The mass enhances during Definity
contrast infusion suggesting a vascularized tissue mass rather
than thrombus. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY IMPRESSION:
1. New subsegmental right and left lower lobe pulmonary arterial
filling
defect consistent with acute pulmonary embolism.
2. Interval decrease in size of left pleural effusion and new
extensive left lower lobe consolidation.
3. Stable moderately large right pleural effusion with
associated compressive atelectasis.
4. Apparent filling defect in the right internal jugular vein
may represent thrombus or a flow artifact and could be further
evalutaed with ultrasound, if clinically appropriate.
5. New left ventricular apical filling defect, most likely
represents a
thrombus as it was not present on the CTA of [**2137-1-2**] but a
cardiac metastasis could also have this appearance.
6. Multiple stable lytic bone metastases, the involvement of the
right T6
pedicle raises the possibility of impingement of the right
transverse foramen and thecal sac, this would be better
evaluated with MRI, if clinically appropriate.
.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2137-2-12**]
IMPRESSION: Possible focus of abnormal enhancement identified in
the right
frontal lobe, involving the right straight gyrus, measuring
approximately 2.8 x 3.3 mm in size, with no evidence of mass
effect or shifting of the adjacent structures. Given the
clinical history, the possibility of a metastatic lesion is a
strong consideration; however, dural enhancement or vascular
enhancement cannot be completely ruled out, correlation with a
dedicated MRI of the orbits and frontal lobe with
high-resolution and gadolinium is recommended.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2137-2-17**]  FINDINGS: Catheters
overlie both hemithoraces. The left pleural effusion is
decreased in size compared to prior. The right effusion is
slightly larger.  There is some residual volume loss/infiltrate
in the left lower lobe. There is also some volume
loss/infiltrate in the right lung. Right Port-A-Cath is still
present. Compared to the prior study, the upper lung aeration is
similar. It is difficult to compare the lower lobes secondary
due to change in size of the effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
60 y/o female with metastatic breast cancer presents with
hypoxia and fatigue.
.
1. Hypoxia / hypercarbia: She initially required a
non-rebreather to keep her O2 sats >90%.
