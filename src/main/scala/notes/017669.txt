Brief Hospital Course:
42 year old man with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21344**] Lindau disease (with
non-functioning pheo s/p right adrenalectomy, pancreatic tail
tumor, retinal hemangiomas, multiple spine hemangiomas),
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (to lungs, scalp and brain)on
sorafenib trial who presented with altered mental status,
hyponatremia, and right lobar PNA.
.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
.
#Severe Hyponatremia-p/w Na 112 at OSH,trending down since
[**Month (only) 359**] (acute on chronic). Possible causes considered were:
adrenal insufficiency (could be primary as he has h/o pheo, or
secondary as he has had surgery on his pituitary gland, but this
was not evidenced by his presentation or vital signs) as he has
had labile BP recently, especially in the setting of
hyperkalemia, or more likely volume depletion secondary to
infection as his exam was consistent with volume depletion.
Other possible cause was SIADH as he has intracranial processes
as well as pneumonia. Also, hypothyroidism could be a cause, but
his thyroid function tests were all normal.  He received 3% NaCl
to correct his sodium and was started on intravenous
antibiotics.  His sodium improved with these interventions.
.
#Change in Mental Status-unclear if from hyponatremia or
infection, more worrisome would be intracranial hemorrhage or
stroke as he has history of this, however he improved with
antibiotic therapy.
.
#right middle lobe pneumonia- sputum culture not obtained, but
empirically placed on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin IV.  His
oxygenation remained adequate on room air and he was largely
asymptomatic.  Blood cx remained  negative. Influenza was
negative. He will finish a 2 week course of antibiotics
.
#?[**Name (NI) 12007**] pt has r nephrostomy tube, u/a concerning for UTI and pt
placed on ceftriaxone also for dual coverage of PNA.  Cultures
were however inconclusive ("mixed urogenital flora").
.
#VHL-stable, hemangiomas of retina, spine
.
#Renal Cell Ca- on chemotherapy (sorafenib) per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
currently on hold
.
#DM-continue home dose of lantus 5 qam and sliding scale
.
#Chronic Pain-home doses of Morphine 15 mg po q.8h p.r.n.
.
#Hypothyroidism-continue levothyroxine, held briefly during
hospitalization
.
#GERD-protonix
