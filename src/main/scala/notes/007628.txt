Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the operating room emergently on [**10-26**] where she
underwent endovascular stent placement of descending thoracic
aorta vioa a retroperitoneal approach. She was extubated the
morning of POD #1 but was reintubated one hour later for
respiratory distress and stridor. Her left subclavian was coiled
for endoleak. She was given stress dose steroids. She was seen
by thoracic surgery for widened mediatinum and small left
pleural effusion post op. Bronchoscopy on [**10-29**] showed narrowing
of distal trachea and B/L mainstem bronchi from compression from
mediatinal hematoma. On [**10-30**] she underwent right thoracentesis
for 450 cc, rigid bronch/flexible bronchoscopy and Y stent
placement with IP on [**10-30**]. She was again extubated and
reintubated for respiratory distress on [**10-30**]. She was seen by
infectious diseases for 2-3 days of fevers. She grew gram +
cocci in blood cultures and proteus in her urine and was started
on vanocmycin and aztreonam and will need to complete a four
week course. On [**11-2**] she was bronched and extubated again, but
was reintubated shortly after for respiratory distress. On [**11-4**]
she underwent tracheostomy. Her health care proxy refused
placement of PEG. She was difficult to sedate and was tried on
Remifentanil, then thorazine with no resolution. Neurology and
psychistry was consulted.  Recommendations were to continue
Thorazine,  in combination with low dose Haldol 2mg TID.  All
other sedation was discontinued.  Weaned off ventilator to
trach-mask on [**11-10**].  Pt tolerated this well.  Heparin drip
continued as INR did not become therapeutic.  Vancomycin trough
was low at 12 on [**11-11**] and so dose was increased to 1250 [**Hospital1 **].
She was ready for discharge for rehab on [**11-11**] and placement was
secured.

Discharge Instructions:
Call with fever, redness or drainage from incision or weight
gain more than 2 pounds in one day or five in one week.

IMPORTANT:  REGARDING COUMADIN: patient has a mechanical valve
and therefore needs to be anticoagulated with heparin drip until
therapeutic INR acheived between 2.5 - 3.0.  Dosing should be
given in response to daily levels and adjusted accordingly.
Dosing as dicated on discharge medication section should
therefore serve as a guideline and not a strict dosage.
