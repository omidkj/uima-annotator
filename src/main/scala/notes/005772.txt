Center for continued management of recently diagnosed renal cell
cancer. During admission, patient had respiratory failure in

atelectasis. Patient exhibited some altered mental status during
her hospitalization and required intubation ([**2158-11-4**]) for
impending respiratory failure. She underwent bronchoscopy which
revealed large amounts of mucus plugging. Cultures grew
S.pneumonia and was treated with Vancomycin and Aztreonam (7 day
course). She was also given fluconazole for potential fungal
source, with pending cultures. While at OSH, she required
multiple bronchoscopies and mucous clearing which were all
unsuccessful. Patient failed to wean from her ventilator and

PATHOLOGY # [**-9/3864**]
LEFT MAIN BRONCHO STEM.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the ICU intubated on [**2158-11-12**]. Bronch was done
which revealed copious mucous plugs. Taken to the OR for rigid
bronchoscopy for tumor debridement w/ cryo. Extubated w/o
difficulty. Left thoracentesis done for 300cc exudative. BNP
1864- diuresed.

Seen by ENT/ Neuro eval for drainage from left ear which pt
reports as ongoing x 1-6 months. Thought to be chrondritis at
OSH but now ENT/Neuro think that this is more likely [**Last Name (un) 80348**] Hunt.
Started on acyclovir in addition to cipro and dexamethasone
gtts. MRI to be done today to eval for CNS involvement. After
MRI will consider steriods 60mg prednisone for 2 weeks and then
taper over one week. Will need ongoing ENT/Neuro follow up.
Cultures and pathology pending at this time.
