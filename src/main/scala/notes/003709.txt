Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest discomfort, dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2157-10-14**] Three Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing
the left internal mammary to left anterior descending, vein
grafts to obtuse marginal and right coronary artery.


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 18252**] presented to outside hospital with seven day history
of exertional chest pain associated with dyspnea. On the morning
of admission, she awoke with chest pain. EKG on admission showed
new lateral T wave abnormalities. She ruled for myocardial
infarction with positive troponin. Stress MIBI revealed anterior
apical defect consistent with ischemic heart disease. Subsequent
cardiac catheterization showed severe three vessel coronary
artery disease including an 80% ostial left main lesion. Given
her critical coronary anatomy, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
for surgical intervention.

Sinus rhythm. Findings are as previously described on the
tracing of [**2157-10-14**]
and are probably without change, although baseline artifact
makes comparison
difficult.

normal LVEF
(>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.

Conclusions:
Prebypass

1.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2.Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.


Post Bypass

1. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.

2. Mild mitral regurgitation persists.

3. Aorta intact post decannulation

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 18252**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and
underwent routine preoperative evaluation. She remained pain
free on intraveous therapy. Workup was unremarkable and she was
cleared for surgery. On [**10-14**], she underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. For surgical details,
please see seperate dicatated operative note. Following the
operation, she was brought to the the CSRU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without incident. Due to hypertension, she
initially required Nitro drip. Over several days, medical
therapy was titrated accordingly and she transferred to the SDU
for further care and recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were
removed without complication. She had several episodes of
agitation and confusion after receiving dilaudid and IV ativan,
the confusion resolved after discontinuing the medications.
However On POD # 5 was seen by psychiatry for disorientation and
agitation after receing ambien for sleep. She was given Haldol
and she improved over a few hours.  She was pleasant and
cooperative in the afternoon and interacting with visitors.  She
was ready for d
