CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain.

Briefly, patient was admitted on [**2147-2-24**] with abdominal pain
and guaiac-positive stool.  Patient had elevated white count
with bandemia and elevated lactate, which was concerning for
small bowel obstruction, ileus, or ischemic colitis.  Patient
also had evidence of pneumatosis on CT.  Patient was seen by
Surgery, who recommended conservative management.  Patient
also had UTI with left lower lobe pneumonia and acute renal
failure with creatinine jumping from 0.07 to 1.7.

Patient was felt to have mesenteric ischemia from low flow
state.  Patient had an exploratory laparotomy performed on
[**2147-2-24**] and at that time was on amp, levo, and Flagyl, which
he was on from [**2-24**] to [**2-27**], and patient was taken to the
SICU on [**2-24**] after exploratory laparotomy and rigid
sigmoidoscopy was performed, and did not reveal ischemic
bowel.  Right IJ was placed on [**2-25**] and [**2-26**], and patient
had hypoglycemic episodes in the setting of poor p.o. intake.
Patient also went into diabetic ketoacidosis and was
maintained on an insulin drip.  His course was further
complicated by an elevated INR unclear source.  The patient
received vitamin K with good response.

On [**3-2**], the patient's blood sugar decreased to 17.  Patient
was maintained on D50 and then D10 drip.  Patient was
somnolent and there is question of worsening facial droop.
Head CT was negative and MRI was not performed, and question
of facial droop subsequently resolved.  Patient also
desaturated to 88% on room air and got Lasix with good
response.

Active issues when patient was transferred to the Medicine
service were hypothermia, UTI, coagulopathy, acute renal
failure, hypertension, CHF, diabetes type 1 complicated by
hypoglycemia, pneumonia, colitis, and altered mental status.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes mellitus.
2. Peripheral vascular disease.
3. Status post CVA.
4. History of right ......... MRSA.
5. History of CHF with an EF of 40-45%.
6. History of VRE.
7. History of COPD.
8. Hypertension.
9. Glaucoma.
10. CRI.
11. Peripheral vascular disease.
12. Duodenal ulcer.
13. History of anemia of chronic disease.
14. Esophageal dysmotility.
15. History of VRE UTI.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature was 95.4, blood pressure was
100/40, pulse of 61, respiratory rate was 14.  Patient was
saturating at 88% on room air and then 100% on 3 liters of
oxygen.  Fingersticks was ranging from 32-207.  Generally:
He was alert and oriented times three in no acute distress,
somnolent, but arousable.  HEENT examination is
normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular movements are intact.
Moist mucous membranes.  No JVD.  Heart is regular rate and
rhythm with no murmurs, clicks, or gallops.  Right IJ is
clean, dry, and intact.  Pulmonary:  Positive bibasilar
crackles at bases.  Abdomen had good bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, and nondistended with midline surgical scar clean,
dry, and intact.  Extremities are free of any clubbing or
cyanosis with 3+ bilateral pitting edema.  Neurologic
examination is alert and oriented times two, somnolent, but
arousable.  Difficult to examine, but nonfocal examination
overall.  Cranial nerves are intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Acute altered mental status:  This is felt secondary to
hypoglycemia as well as UTI.  Patient was treated for both
conditions and his mental status returned to baseline.

2. ID:  Patient had UTI and was treated with levofloxacin for
a total of 14 days, which he is to continue a course once
discharged from the hospital.  Patient also had a urine sent,
which was significant for greater than 100,000 yeast.  It was
felt that given his tenuous condition, that patient should be
treated with fluconazole.  Hence, he received a three-day
treatment for the yeast in his urine.

3. Colitis:  Again, patient's colitis was felt to be
secondary to ischemia.  Conservative management was
recommended.  Patient was hence, maintained on levo and
Flagyl to complete a 14-day course.  GI was following the
patient initially, and felt that repeat scopes were currently
not indicated.  Patient did have guaiac-positive stools, but
his hematocrit remained stable.  In total, patient received 1
unit of packed red blood cells with good response.  His
hematocrits ranged in the 30s.

4. Hypothermia:  Again felt likely secondary to infected
state.  Patient's temperatures returned to [**Location 213**] by time of
discharge.

5. Acute renal failure:  Felt secondary to ATN in the setting
of CT scan.  Patient was maintained on fluid restriction
actually and prn diuresis for a goal of negative 1 liter
until euvolemia was achieved.  Patient's creatinine returned
to baseline by the time of discharge.  Patient maintained
good urine output without complications.  Patient was changed
to 40 mg of Lasix one p.o. q.d. by time of discharge.

6. Hypoglycemia:  Again, the patient is a very frail
diabetic.  Initially hypoglycemia was secondary to poor p.o.
intake.  By the time of discharge, the patient was changed to
5 units of Lantus q.h.s. and a liberal regular
insulin-sliding scale, which should be attached with
discharge paperwork.  The patient's fingersticks were checked
q.4h.  His glucoses generally ranged from 80s-380s.  Patient
did have intermittent hypoglycemic episodes into the 40s in
the setting of poor p.o. intake.

7. CHF with EF of 40-45%.  Patient was maintained on 1000 cc
a day fluid restriction.  He is maintained on a low salt
diabetic diet, that is 2-gram sodium diet.  Patient's strict
I's and O's were followed, and patient diuresed very nicely.
His chest x-rays revealed that patient had decreasing
pulmonary edema as well as decreasing size of pleural
effusion.  Patient was eventually changed to 40 mg dose of
p.o. Lasix by the time of discharge.

8. Hypertension:  Patient was initially maintained on
Lopressor and hydralazine to maintain a systolic blood
pressure lower than 130.  By time of discharge, he was
changed from hydralazine to captopril, which can be titrated
up once the patient is discharged.

9. Peripheral vascular disease:  Patient was restarted on his
Plavix.

10. FEN:  Patient was initially maintained on clears.  His
diet was then advanced to a 2-gram sodium and diabetic diet.
Patient had a speech and swallow evaluation and a video
swallow, which the patient passed with no evidence of gross
aspiration.

11. Colitis:  Again felt secondary to ischemia likely.
Conservative management was recommended.  Lactates were
followed initially and remained within normal limits.  Stool
was mildly guaiac positive.  Hematocrits were stable.
Patient did receive 1 unit of packed red blood cells with
good response.

12. Coagulopathy:  Patient had an elevated INR in the setting
of low albumin likely felt secondary to poor nutritional
state.  Once patient started eating better, it was noted that
his INR stabilized to 1.1 to 1.2.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Furosemide 40 mg one p.o. q.d.
2. Captopril 6.25 mg one p.o. t.i.d.
3. Insulin-sliding scale to be attached to discharge summary.
4. Mirtazapine 15 mg one p.o. q.h.s.
5. Lantus 5 mg subq q.h.s.
6. Albuterol MDI prn.
7. Atrovent MDIs prn.
8. Metoprolol 75 mg p.o. one p.o. t.i.d.
9. Calcium carbonate 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Metoclopramide 5 mg one p.o. q.i.d. a.c./h.s.
11. Famotidine 20 mg one p.o. q.d.
12. Metronidazole 500 mg one p.o. q.8h. for a total of six
days.
13. Levofloxacin 250 mg one p.o. q.24h. for a total of six
days.
14. Plavix 75 mg one p.o. q.d.
15. Aspirin 325 mg one p.o. q.d.
16. Nystatin oral suspension 5 mL one p.o. q.i.d.
17. Fluticasone 110 mcg two puffs b.i.d.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair to stable.  He is stable on room
air.  Is alert and oriented times three.  He is able to
tolerate a 2-gram diabetic diet without evidence of
aspiration.  He is no longer in overt CHF.  His creatinine
has stabilized.  Patient's hypoglycemia episodes have been
controlled, and patient is afebrile and
