.
Of note, the patient has expressive aphasia has difficult giving
a reliable and clear history. The patient currently reports he
has been experiencing stable dyspnea on exertion and stable 2
pillow orthopnea. He does report feeling lightheaded at rest
intermittently over the past 1-3 weeks which lasts 5-20 minutes
and resolves sponatenously. These episodes are associated with
nausea and he has also been experiencing generalized myalgiase
and a non-productive occasional cough. The patient denies chest

Imaging:
=========
CXR [**2-4**]: Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Mild
bibasilar atelectasis with chronic elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm.
.
TTE [**2-7**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal ak/dyskinesis of the
septum and moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF
= 25-30 %). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] At
least moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Symmetric left
ventricular
