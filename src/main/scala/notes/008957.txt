History of Present Illness:
77-year-old female who was involved in a motor vehicle crash;
restrained front-seat passenger. She was at first taken to a
area hospital where she was noted to be hypotensive; CT abdomen
showed some fluid in her abdomen with an
injured spleen. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for furhter
trauma care. In the trauma bay, she was noted to be hypotensive
and tachycardiac; she was then takne to the operating room for
exploratory laparotomy.

SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: SPLEEN AND SMALL BOWEL (1).

DIAGNOSIS:

Spleen and small bowel (A):

1.  Splenic laceration with parenchymal and hilar hemorrhage.



2.  Segment of small bowel with a focal defect of the muscularis
propria and acute appearing hemorrhage without an associated
inflammatory response.

Clinical:    Ruptured spleen; enterotomy with segment of small
bowel resection.
Gross:



The specimen is received fresh labeled with "[**Known lastname 68291**]" and
the medical record number and "spleen and small bowel" and
consists of a spleen, a fragment of small bowel and multiple
fragments of blood clot.  There is a separate blood clot present
which measures 15 x 10 x 1.5 cm. The color is dark in
appearance.  The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal
unremarkable dark red surfaces with a small fragment of blood
clot which is slightly firmer to touch.  This ara is sectioned
to reveal a beefy internal consistency. This area measures 9 x 2
x 1.5 cm.  Representative sections of this area are submitted in
A.



A portion of unoriented small bowel is present and measures 13
cm in length.  The average diameter of the small bowel is
approximately 1.4 cm.  There is an attached section of
mesenteric fat. The margins measure 2.4 cm and 2.6 cm .The
external surface of the segment of small bowel is pink tan in
appearance and grossly appears unremarkable. No masses can be
felt. Representative section of one resection margin is
submitted in B.  Representative section of the other resection
margin is submitted in C.   The small bowel is longitudinally
cut along its anti-mesenteric surface to reveal relatively
unremarkable appearing mucosal folds with a thick layer of
overlying green/tan mucus.  No erosions or mass lesions are
seen.  The thickness of the small bowel wall approximates 0.2
cm. On the serosal surface a suture is in place and this
corresponds to an area of dimpling on the mucosal surface. The
area is submitted in D.  Representative sections of the small
bowel are submitted in E.



The spleen measures 12.0 x 7.5 x 2.8 cm. It weighs 201 grams. At
the superior pole there is a defect in the capsule and a focal
area of hemorrhage which measures approximately 4.5 x 3.5 cm.
There is a surgical stapled resection margin about the hilum
which measures 9 cm. There is additionally a focal area of
hemorrhage about the hilum which measures approximately 3.5 x
1.4 cm. At the posterior/inferior pole, of the spleen there is
an area where the splenic capsule is absent and this measures
5.0 x 3.5 cm. On the anterior surface of the spleen there is
also an additional area where the capsule is absent and this
measures 4.5 x 3.0 cm. Representative sections of the hilum
resection margin is submitted in F.  The spleen is sectioned in
transverse manner to reveal focal areas of hemorrhage about the
superior third of the spleen. The hemorrhages are scattered in a
multi-focal distribution and extend to a depth of approximately
3.0 cm to the body of the spleen.  No masses are noted. The
remainder of the splenic parenchyma is beefy red in appearance
and unremarkable.  Representative sections of the spleen are
submitted as follows; Representative sections of subcapsular and
intraparenchymal hemorrhages are submitted in G, appearing
spleen are in H.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function. No resting
LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta. No 2D or
Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. No
MVP.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%), without
regional wall
motion abnormalitiesl. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated
anterior
pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mildly
dilated ascending aorta.
