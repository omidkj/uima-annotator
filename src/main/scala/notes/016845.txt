Date of Birth:   [**2168-10-6**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 33-year-old
female with type 1 diabetes with complications of
gastroparesis who presented to the Emergency Department on
[**8-11**] with 10/10 chest pain.

In the Emergency Department, she had no electrocardiogram
changes compared to previous electrocardiograms, and cardiac
enzymes drawn were negative times two.

She also complained of nausea and vomiting for which she
received Zofran with some relief.  Her initial fingersticks
in the Emergency Department were 280.  She was treated with
subcutaneous Humalog insulin.  Her initial anion gap was 19.
Her fingerstick blood sugar decreased to 131.  She was
started on normal saline at 150 cc per hour.  She was
admitted to the floor with an anion gap of 15 and a
fingerstick that had risen to 389 at 7 p.m. on [**8-11**].
Humalog 10 units subcutaneously were given on the floor, and
she was started on D-5 half normal saline with 20 mEq of
potassium at 150 cc per hour.  She was also started on a
regular insulin drip on the floor.  Her urinalysis showed
positive ketones and glucose, and she had moderate acetones
in her serum.  Her arterial blood gas on the floor revealed a
pH of 7.38, PCO2 of 37, and a PO2 of 170 on 2 liters to 3
liters of nasal cannula oxygen.  Over the next few hours,
intravenous access was lost, so the insulin drip was off.
Her fingerstick blood sugar increased to the 400s at 9:30
p.m. and the gap increased to 20.  She was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for every one hour fingersticks.

In addition to her diabetic ketoacidosis, and chest pain, and
nausea, and vomiting, the patient also had a complaint of a
persistent vaginal cyst which had previously been drained on
a prior admission one week before.

what type of cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed
she had a temperature of 98 degrees Fahrenheit, her blood
pressure was 110/50, her heart rate was 88, her respiratory
rate was 18, and her oxygen saturation was 99% on 3 liters
nasal cannula.  In general, the patient was a young
African-American female who appeared mildly ill.  She was
anicteric.  She had moist mucous membranes without any
lesions.  Cardiovascular examination revealed she was
tachycardic with normal first heart sounds and second heart
sounds.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Her lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Her abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  She had
a firm 3-cm to 4-cm nodule located at about 11 o'clock on the
right mons pubis.  He extremities were without cyanosis,
clubbing, or edema.  She had a 3-cm X 1-cm ulceration on the
dorsum of her right base with a clean base.  No erythema.
Her dorsalis pedis pulses were 1+ bilaterally.  Neurologic
examination revealed she was alert and oriented times three.
Her neurologic examination a grossly nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed her white blood cell count was 8.8, her
hematocrit was 28.9, and her platelet count was 735.  Her
Chemistry-7 revealed her sodium was 138, potassium was 4.8,
chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 21, blood urea nitrogen was
48, creatinine was 2.2, and blood glucose was 378.  She had a
urine culture drawn which eventually grew Klebsiella.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  She had a chest x-ray which was
normal; without any evidence of acute processes.

Her electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department had a rate
of 104, normal axis and normal intervals.  Poor baseline but
without any ST-T wave changes or T wave inversions.  She had
borderline left ventricular hypertrophy compared with a
previous electrocardiogram on [**2202-8-4**].

On the series of electrocardiograms she had in the Emergency
Department, she had no changes.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient is a 33-year-old woman who was admitted for chest
pain, diabetic ketoacidosis, nausea, vomiting, and groin pain
due to a cyst that she has there.

1.  DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS ISSUES:  The patient was initially
admitted to the floor; however, because of loosing her
intravenous access, her drip was stopped.  Her fingersticks
and anion gap become uncontrolled, and she was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for every one hour
fingersticks and an insulin drip administration.

Over the course of the next 24 hours, her fingersticks
decreased while on the insulin drip.  The insulin drip was
titrated down, and subcutaneous insulin was started.  After
her anion gap closed, the insulin drip was stopped.  She was
continued on subcutaneous Humalog insulin, and it was
adjusted according to her fingersticks in house.

At the time of discharge, her fingerstick blood sugars were
in the high 100s.  Her Humalog was adjusted to control her
fingerstick blood sugars.  We increased her Lantus to 20
units subcutaneously q.h.s. to cover for the amount of
Humalog insulin she was requiring during the day.  She will
need to be seen by her primary care physician within the next
week to review her insulin requirements and make appropriate
changes.

2.  URINARY TRACT INFECTION ISSUES:  The patient was treated
for her urinary tract infection with levofloxacin with an
initial dose of 500 mg and subsequent doses of 250 mg, and
she had completed her course while hospitalized.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  Ruled out for a myocardial
infarction.   The patient had chest pain on admission without
significant electrocardiogram changes in the Emergency
Department, and no changes in her cardiac enzymes.  While in
the Medical Intensive Care Unit, she also had one additional
episode of chest pain that was relieved with two sublingual
nitroglycerin tablets; also without electrocardiogram changes
or elevated cardiac enzymes.

The patient had a recent stress test in [**2198**] which did not
show any ischemia; however, the patient only lasted six
minutes on the treadmill.  She had a recent echocardiogram in
[**Month (only) 547**] of this year which showed left ventricular hypertrophy.
We tried have the patient complete a Persantine stress test
while in house; however, she refused the examination.

4.  CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  Initially, her creatinine
had bumped to 2.2, and 2.4, and 2.6.  With hydration, her
creatinine returned to baseline at 2.  Initially, her ACE
inhibitors were held; however, when her creatinine was at
baseline she was restarted on captopril with increasing
doses.  At the time of discharge, she was changed back to her
home medication of lisinopril.

4.  PAIN ISSUES:  Initially, when the patient was admitted,
she had severe pain secondary to the cyst in her groin.  She
was given as needed morphine and Tylenol for the pain.

5.  GROIN CYST ISSUES:  The patient was seen by Gynecology
for incision and drainage of the cyst.  Wound cultures at the
time of discharge were pending.  She was noted to have
vaginal candidiasis and received one dose of fluconazole 150
mg intravenously.  The patient was to follow up with
Gynecology in one week
