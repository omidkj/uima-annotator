--Cardiac cath [**2119-9-25**] showed 3 vessel disease.  LAD was 100%
occluded, LCX had patent Cypher stent with new 99% stenosis post
stent and 100% occlusion of bare metal stent in OM1. RCA was
100% occluded. LIMA was patent but SVG graft was 100% occluded.
She underwent repeat stenting of the OM1 lesion with a Cypher
stent and 20% residual stenosis.
3. Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%.

.
CXR [**9-30**]
The lungs are hyperinflated, and the diaphragms are flattened,
together with parenchymal scarring, all consistent with COPD.
The patient is status post sternotomy, with mediastinal clips.
There is moderate cardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified and
unfolded.  There is a minimal blunting of the left costophrenic
angle consistent with a small effusion, new compared with
[**2119-9-22**].  There is associated patchy opacity - this likely
represents atelectasis, though an early infiltrate would be
difficult to exclude. Minimal new opacity is seen at the right
base peripherally, with slight blunting of the right
costophrenic angle.  There is upper zone re-distribution,
probably with mild CHF.  Some atelectasis is seen in the right
mid zone, together with some thickening of the minor fissure.
Clips are noted over the right
shoulder/axilla.
IMPRESSION:  Probable very mild CHF, worse compared with
[**2119-9-22**].  Small left and right pleural effusions, more
pronounced than on [**2119-9-22**].  Bibasilar atelectasis.  It would be
difficult to exclude the earliest findings of infiltrate at the
left base.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's elevated
creatinine in the setting of recent cardiac catheterization most
likely represented contrast nephropathy. Her creatinine improved
with time, but was still above baseline (1.7) at time of
discharge. Her ACEI and digoxin were held. Her creatinine will
need to be rechecked in the next week as an outpatient.
.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium in the emergency
department was 5.6, with no peaked T waves on EKG. She received
kayexalate once with return of her potassium to the normal
range. Her ACEI and spironolactone were held.
.
3. Dyspnea, CAD, CHF: The patient developed chest discomfort on
the floor and was subsequently transferred to the CCU for
further evaluation. EKG obtained the morning of transfer to the
CCU showed pseudonormalization of T waves laterally. Due to her
elevated creatinine, the decision was made to manage her
medically rather than proceed to cardiac catheterization. Upon
arrival in the CCU, her primary complaint was dyspnea. Her
symptoms improved following a nitroglycerin drip and lasix
diuresis. Her troponins were mildly elevated (peaking at 0.22,
but CK's remained flat) consistent with a NSTEMI. She did become
tachycardic in the setting of her respiratory distress so there
was likely a component of demand ischemia to her troponin leak.
She will continue on imdur at home for additional control of her
angina. She will continue on her aspirin, plavix, statin,
beta-blocker, and lasix. Her ACEI and digoxin will be resumed
following further recovery of her renal function.
.
4. Urinary tract infection: The patient had a foley in hospital,
and subsequently developed a urinary tract infection due to
pan-sensitive E. coli. She will complete a 7 day course of
ciprofloxacin.
.
5. Atrial fibrillation: She continued rate control with
metoprolol. She is not on anticoagulation at home.
.
6. Diabetes: The patient's glyburide was held initially and her
sugars were controlled with a sliding scale. Her glyburide was
subsequently restarted prior to discharge.
.
7. Anemia, chronic: The patient was seen by the
hematology-oncology service on the floor who felt that the
patient's chronic anemia was most likely due to her chronic
renal insufficiency. She will start on epoetin per their
recommendations. She has had some heme+ stools in hospital, in
the setting of hemorrhoids, and her iron studies did not
indicate significant iron deficiency.
