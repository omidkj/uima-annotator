Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 year old gentleman with a history of CAD s/p MI
and pacer who presented to an outside hospital today after being
found down at home.  The patient is a very poor historian and
unable to give much history.  Per outside records and report he
was found down in his house today by his daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] had
obvious facial contusions and had no memory of how he had fallen
or what had happened.  The patient doenn't actually remember
events in this way and thinks he fell at a hospital.  He doesn't
remember falling or anything that happened this morning.  He
reports falling occasionally before but reports these were
typically mechanical falls, like falling over a rug.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.7, P 93, BP 104/56, RR 18, O2
96% on RA.  Labs were notable for elevated Cr, borderline
troponin elevations, and an EKG with signs of old MI.  Trauma
was consulted and deferred to neurosurgery.  Neurosurgery  was
concerned about the possibiility of a primary etiology of
syncope and recommended admission to medicne.

Currenly, he endorses mild headache on questioning.  Otherwise
no current issues.

.
[**2162-8-23**] CT HEAD (most recent)- IMPRESSION:
1. Slight interval increase in size of left temporo-parietal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with slightly increased amount of
blood layering dependently in the lateral ventricles.
2. No new areas of hemorrhage.
3. No herniation or midline shift.
.
[**2162-8-20**] Admit CT HEAD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple foci of bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, with
interval
worsening compared to prior scan, now also involving dependent
portions of bilateral posterior ventricular horns. New right
temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and possible left tentorial
subdural hematoma.
3. Left preseptal soft tissue swelling. Bilateral subcutaneous
gas in the lateral temporal soft tissues, with no definite
underlying fracture. If clinical concern for fracture, dedicated
maxillofacial CT scan suggested.
.
TTE [**2162-8-21**] :
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
15-20 %). The anterior wall and septum have slightly better
function than the other segments. There is a conduit from the
left ventricular apex that probably connects to the descending
aorta. It appears widely patent with substantial flow. A left
ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is
present (not quantified). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe global LV hypokinesis. The anterior wall and
septum have relatively better function. Severely thickened and
calcified aortic leaflets. There is a conduit seen from the left
ventricular apex. This probably connects to the descending aorta
and is designed to "bypass" the stenotic aortic valve. At least
mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
87 year old male with known multiple medical problems (though
unclear chronicity and level of debility) as well as on chronic
anticoagulation for AF presenting after a fall at home with
subarachnoid hemorage.  Initially, the patient remained
neurologically intact and underwent syncope evaluation which was
unrevealing. His INR was reversed with vitamin K and FFP. On
[**8-25**] he was found to be more somnolent, responding
intermittently to sternal rub with [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] respirations in
the setting of new coagulopathy and hepatitis. In discussion
with his daughter, goals of care were transitioned to comfort
measures and his AICD was turned off.

During his stay, the following issues were addressed:
1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage:  Neuro checks were done Q2;  mental
status was responsive and oriented to person but not place or
time on presentation and he had no focal neurological deficits.
Head CT showed an intraparencyhmal hemorrhage in the right
temperoparietal region that was stable on repeat head CTs.
Dilantin was started for seizure prophylaxis; levels were within
normal limits.  Coumadin was held given bleed; was actively
reversed with FFP.  On the day of discharge, mental status
acutely changed and patient was transitioned to comfort measures
only with IM ativan as needed for seizure activity.

2) Coagulopathy:  Coumadin was held given bleed.
Anticoagulation has been for hx of atrial fibrillation and also
has a graft connecting his left ventricle to descending aorta
placed at [**Hospital1 2025**]; cardiology was consulted and they felt that given
his low CHADS2 score and after reviewing the graft, they felt
that holding coumadin in setting of bleed was appropriate.  They
noted that watching for ischemia/clots/emboli in the lower
extremities was important, as emboli from the graft would be
predisposed to going there.  During his hospital course, despite
further vitamin K and FFP, he became more hypercoagulable in the
setting of acute hepatitis and absence of clear DIC.

3) Syncope: Unclear what caused patient's fall.  Ultimately, may
not have been syncopal episode and think patient'
