Imaging:

[**2176-11-15**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**2175-8-3**], there is
little change.
Specifically, there is no convincing evidence of aspiration at
this time.
[**2176-11-17**] CXR: 1. Status post surgery with volume loss on the
right. Bibasilar atelectasis and background COPD. Possible
background pulmonary hypertension. 2. No new patchy opacities to
confirm the presence of aspiration pneumonitis.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the thoracic surgery service on
[**2176-11-15**] following his scheduled LLL wedge resection, which was
not performed due to an aspiration event in the OR upon
induction. Instead, he had a broncheoalveolar lavage and
bronchoscopy for his aspiration. He was initially admitted to
the SICU for close monitoring of his pulmonary status with
concern for aspiration pneumonitis. He was NPO and on IVFs. His
O2 sats remained stable throughout his ICU course and he was
transferred to the floor the next day. CXR on [**2176-11-16**] did not
show radiologic evidence of pneumonitis, but his O2 saturation
decreased to the 80s upon ambulation. Thus, it was decided not
to take him to the OR on Sunday to perform the previously
scheduled wedge resection. He was stable on 2L NC overnight on
the floor and had no symptomatic complaints and no shortness of
breath. He was started on a full liquid diet and advanced
quickly to a diabetic diet. His home medications were restarted
and his IVF stopped when he started PO. He ambulated without
difficulty and his pain was well controlled on minimal pain
medication. He was ready for discharge from the hospital on
[**2176-11-17**] to home with the plan to return in a couple weeks for
completion of his wedge resection at a future date.
