Pertinent Results:
[**2189-5-8**]

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: Study performed in conjunction with
the speech and swallow division. Varying consistencies of barium
were given and video fluoroscopy was performed during all phases
of swallowing. The patient had significant difficulty initiating
the oropharyngeal phase of the swallow. No penetration or
aspiration was identified, however, significant barium was
retained within the valleculae, which could not be cleared with
coughing. During the exam the patient continued to regurgitate
barium and the esophagus was noted to be markedly dilated,
tapering at the lower esophageal sphincter. A 13 mm barium
tablet was administered, which became lodged within the
valleculae, and could not be cleared. Several attempts to pass
the tablet were unsuccessful. Eventually, the patient vomited
the residual barium and the tablet, upon which the exam was
terminated.

IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of aspiration or penetration; however,
significant difficulty initiating the oropharyngeal swallow with
barium and barium tablet retained within the vallecula. See
speech pathologist report.
2) Significantly dilated esophagus tapering distally, suggesting
the lower esophageal sphincter spasm. Correlate clinically.

ECHO

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV cavity.
Overall normal

LVEF (>55%). [Intrinsic LV systolic function depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic root. Moderately dilated
ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mild AS. Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Severe [4+]
TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.The right atrium is markedly dilated.
3.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]
4.The aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated.
5.There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8. There is no pericardial effusion.
9. There is an echogenic density in the right ventricle
consistent with a
pacemaker lead.

RENAL U.S. PORT

FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 12.4 cm. There is a 6 x 6.1
x 5.5 simple cyst at the upper pole. The right renal artery and
vein are patent. Doppler exam is technically limited, blood flow
is detected at the upper pole, interpolar region, and lower
pole. The left kidney measures 12.1 cm. Limited Doppler exam
demonstrates blood flow throughout the kidney, but adequate
waveforms could not be obtained due to respiratory motion. There
are no stones in either kidney or evidence of hydronephrosis.
The bladder is mildly distended with urine.

IMPRESSION: Technically limited exam with blood flow detected in
both kidneys. No evidence of hydronephrosis.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:

89 year old man with questionable SBO / incarcerated hernia

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

SBO Incarcerated inguinal hernis; patient cannot get po contrast
-- with achalasihernia

ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There are calcifications within the
coronary arteries. Calcified bilateral pleural plaques are
consistent with asbestos exposure. There is a small right
pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis. Fine detail within
the lung bases is limited by respiratory motion. Within the
limits of this unenhanced scan, multiple calcifications are seen
within the liver and spleen, consistent with previous
granulomatous disease. The pancreas is atrophic. Several
calcified gallstones are present within an otherwise
unremarkable appearing gallbladder. There is no change in the
appearance of multiple bilateral renal cysts, incompletely
evaluated on this exam without intravenous contrast. The bowel
is not well assessed without oral contrast material. A large
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm is noted measuring 6.7 x
8.0 cm, which is slightly larger than on the prior exam. The
aneurysm sac contains mixed density material and some
calcification. There is a 9 mm nonobstructing stone at the lower
pole of the left kidney.

PELVIS WITH LIMITED ORAL CONTRAST: The bladder is distended.
Detail within the deep pelvis is limited by streak artifact from
the patient's left metallic hip prosthesis. There is a wide
based protrusion of abdominal contents into the right inguinal
canal, but no evidence of bowel obstruction. Similarly, within
the lower left abdominal wall, there is a soft tissue density
superficial to the musculature, which may or may not be
connected to bowel, and is difficult to assess on this exam
without oral contrast. This may represent a subcutaneous process
or a [**Doctor Last Name **] hernia containing small bowel.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions. Multiplanar reformatted images redemonstrate the above
findings and are of grade 4.

IMPRESSION:

1) Difficult exam due to the lack of oral contrast. Probable
right inguinal hernia and
