Admission Date:  [**2106-8-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2106-8-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2056-8-6**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old male with
poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia with atrial
fibrillation refractory to cardioversion.  The patient has
been cardioverted every few months since [**2103-5-3**], but
unfortunately remains in normal sinus rhythm for a few weeks
after cardioversion.  A radiofrequency ablation was attempted
in [**2106-5-3**] but was aborted due to an episode of
hypotension in the catheterization laboratory.

He was admitted on [**2106-8-2**] and underwent an elective
radiofrequency ablation which was complicated by septal
perforation and cardiac tamponade with hypotension.  A
pericardial drain was placed and drained for a few hours.  It
was pulled after a repeat echocardiogram demonstrated no
re-accumulation of fluid.

He was then discharged home on [**2106-8-4**] and was without
complaints until three days prior to the current admission
when he noticed increased shortness of breath, chest pain,
and presyncopal symptoms.  He followed up with his primary
care physician who sent him in for a transthoracic
echocardiogram which showed re-accumulation of pericardial
fluid.

He was brought to the catheterization laboratory at [**Hospital1 1444**] where he was found to have
equalization of pressures (right atrial was 17, right
ventricular was 40/25, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
was 22, pulmonary artery pressure was 42/25).  A
pericardicentesis was performed in which 350 cc of bloody
fluid was withdrawn.  He was then admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for hemodynamic monitoring and treatment with the
pericardial drain in place.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Asthma.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
4.  Gout.
5.  Atrial fibrillation.
6.  Spinal cord injury, status post motor vehicle accident.
7.  Peptic ulcer disease without symptoms for the last 20
years.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Outpatient medications included
Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., Losartan 100 mg p.o. q.d.,
atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d., Rythmol 225 mg b.i.d.,
probenecid 500 mg p.o. b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  ZESTORETIC causes gastrointestinal upset.
PENICILLIN (allergic reaction during childhood).  ALLOPURINOL
causes facial swelling.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Neck surgery secondary to motor vehicle accident.
2.  Laryngeal polyps which were removed as a teenager.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He denies any tobacco use, occasional
alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
on admission to the Coronary Care Unit revealed a temperature
of 100.1, blood pressure was 134/89, heart rate was 79 in
normal sinus rhythm, respiratory rate was 25, oxygen
saturation was 97% on room air.  Swan numbers were pulmonary
artery pressure of 19/13, a CPP of 8.  In general, the
patient was in no apparent distress.  He was mildly obese and
was in moderate pain.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
revealed the oropharynx was clear.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  There were no carotid bruits, and he had anicteric
sclerae.  His chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The pericardial drain was in place without any hematoma.
Cardiovascular examination revealed he was a regular rate.
He had a normal first heart sound and second heart sound.
There were murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdominal examination
revealed his abdomen on examination was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Normal active bowel sounds.  There was no
hepatosplenomegaly.  His extremities demonstrated no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  His right femoral sheath was in
place; there was no hematoma or bruit.  There were 2+
dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibialis pulse
bilaterally.  His skin was warm and dry.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
revealed a white blood cell count of 12.5, hemoglobin
was 12.3, hematocrit was 35.9, platelets were 410.  Chemistry
revealed sodium was 135, potassium was 3.8, chloride was 103,
bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 16, creatinine
was 0.9, blood glucose was 102.  PT was 13.9, INR was 1.4.
Pericardial fluid revealed total protein of 5.3, LDH was 585,
glucose was 101, amylase was 38, albumin was 3.2.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 49-year-old male with recurrent atrial
fibrillation refractory to medications and cardioversion.
Radiofrequency ablation performed earlier this month was
complicated by septal perforation and tamponade.  He returns
now with re-accumulation of fluid and cardiac tamponage
physiology, status post pericardiocentesis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit with a pericardial drain in place which had
previously drained 350 cc in the catheterization laboratory.

About 50 cc were drained overnight, and a repeat
echocardiogram was done in the morning which showed a trivial
effusion.  Therefore, the drain was pulled on [**2106-8-24**]
without complications.

The patient was started on his outpatient drug regimen and
started on a prednisone taper in order to decrease
pericardial inflammation.  He was transferred to the floor on
the evening of [**2106-8-24**] in stable and improved
condition.

A follow-up echocardiogram was done on the day of discharge
which showed a normal ejection fraction, a decrease in size
of the effusion, with a thickened pericardium demonstrating
early constrictive physiology.  The patient was asymptomatic
throughout his hospital course, denying any shortness of
breath or syncopal symptoms while out of bed.

Given his history of atrial fibrillation, he was monitored
closely on telemetry and demonstrated no arrhythmias.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable
and improved.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Atrial fibrillation, status post radiofrequency ablation.
2.  Cardiac tamponade.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Gout.
6.  Asthma.
7.  Remote history of peptic ulcer disease.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Probenecid 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Rythmol 225 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Prednisone taper 50/50, 40/40, 30/30, 20/20, [**11-11**], [**6-6**].

The patient was to discontinue Losartan until follow-up
appointment.  The patient was to discontinue aspirin for the
next 30 days.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was scheduled for a transthoracic
echocardiogram on [**2106-9-7**] at 11 a.m.
2.  The patient was to schedule a follow-up appointment with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two to four weeks after discharge.
