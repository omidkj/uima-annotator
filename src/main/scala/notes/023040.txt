Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 69048**] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization.
Results revealed a right dominant system and demonstrated severe
three vessel coronary disease.  The left main had no
angiographically apparent disease. A long segment of the mid LAD
was subtotally occluded. It supplied collaterals to the
subtotally occluded RCA.  The circumflex had a 50% discrete
lesion in the OM1. The OM2 was sutotally occluded and filled in
late via collaterals. The proximal RCA had a complex lesion and
was subtotally occluded. Left ventriculography was not
performed. Based on the above results, cardiac surgery was
consulted and further preoperative evaluation was performed. An
echocardiogram showed mild depressed LV function and inferior
akinesis. The LVEF was estimated at 45%. The was no aortic
insufficiency and only mild mitral regurgitation. His ascending
aorta was mildly dilated, measuring 3.8 centimeters.
Preoperative workup was otherwise unremarkable and he was
cleared for surgery. Surgery was delayed several days as he was
given a 600mg Plavix load at time of cardiac catheterization. On
[**8-13**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting. For further surgical details, please see separate
dictated operative note. Following the operation, he was brought
to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident.
Initially hypertensive, beta blockade was resumed while
Hydralazine was used prn. His CSRU course was otherwise
uneventful and he transferred to the SDU on postoperative day
two. Given his body habitus and immobility, SQ Heparin was
utilized for PE prophylaxis. Over several several days, beta
blockade was advanced as tolerated and his preoperative
calcium-channel blocker was resumed. He continued to make
clinical imrovements with diuresis and was medically cleared for
discharge home on [**2142-8-20**].  He is to follow up here, on [**Hospital Ward Name 7717**]
for a wound assessment on Friday, [**8-24**].
