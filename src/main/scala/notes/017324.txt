History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 60y/o F with PMH of COPD (O2 dependent) who was
admitted to OSH on [**5-18**] with dyspnea and chest discomfort. She
has a recent admission [**4-20**] for resp distress and was treated w/
ceftazidime for Pseudomonas URI. She was then admitted on [**5-18**]
with SOB, CP and abdominal pain. She was treated for a COPD
exacerbation and is currently on a steroid taper. Additionally,
she developed C. diff and was started on IV flagyl and Po
vancomycin on the day of admission. During this hospitalization,
she also underwent a laproscopic CCY given her abdominal pain.
Her abdominal pain did not resolve, so she the thought was she
had a bile leak. Therefore, a HIDA scan was performed which per
reports suggested a bile leak, and she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for an
ERCP. On ERCP was performed and did not show eveidence of bile
leak but a stent was placed. The procedure was uncomplicated and
she received a total of 2 L IVF during this time. She was
tachypneic before the procedure by nursing reports, but after
the procedure was increasingly tachypneic with increasing O2
requirement with sats eventually in high 90s on 6L FM at the
time of evaluation. She repots that she feel more SOB than her
baseline, Denies CP, abdominal pain, fevers, chills. She does
complain of some nause which was improved with zofran in the
ERCP holding area.

CXR: Bilateral flattening of diaphragms with ? anterior bleb. No
PNA or pulmonary edema

Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo female with COPD on home O2, pulmonary HTN, recent lap CCY
and recently diagnosed C. diff transferred from [**Hospital 1263**] hospital
for ERCP with worseing SOB and tachypnea

# SOB/tachypnea: Most likely COPD exacerbation given recent
steroid taper, poor air movement, and relatively unremarkable
CXR. Also, consider aspiration peri-procedure, but less likely
as no overt signs on CXR. This could be pulmonary edema as well
given she received fluids during the procedure, but she does not
appear to be volume overloaded on exam. Also, consider PE, but
has been on DVT prophylaxis and no evidence of DVT. She was
given albuterol and atrovent nebulizers, prednisone 60 mg POx1
and her O2 was weaned to 3 L NC with O2 sats in the low 90s and
RR in mid 20s. She was continued on prednisone 60 mg po QDAY x3
days on transfer back to [**Hospital 1263**] hospital.

# Abdominal pain s/p ERCP: Recent CCY. Sent here for ERCP.
Uncomplicated procedure. Stent was placed.  Was kept NPO
overnight, diet advanced at tolerated in AM. She was strted on
ciprofloxacin in addition to flagyl for a 7 day course. She
should have stent removal in 1 month.

# Nausea/vomiting: Per her report this has been going on for
some time. Could be secondary to pain meds, C. diff. She was
continued on antiemetics.

# Elevated WBC: Most likley secondary to C. diff. Currently
afebrile and HD stable. Other possible sources are UTI or PNA,
but CXR is unremarkable and UA only with pyuria.  She did have
an abdominal procedure, but abdominal exam is benign. Also,
consider steroids, but unlikely to raise WBC this high. She was
continued on  Po vancomycin, IV flagyl, ciprofloxacin given
instrumentation of biliary tree. Urine culture and final
radiology read of CXR is pending at discharge.

# C. diff: Her WBC were extremely elevated to 46 on admission,
then down to 35 the following day woth a HCO3 of 15.  She was
continued on Po vanco and IV flagyl given a 500 cc bolus plus NS
at 150 cc/hr with UOP of 40-60 cc/hr.

# HTN: Her antihypertensives were held overnight and can be
restarted pending clnical stability.

# FEN: She was NPO overnight. Now ADAT

# PPX: PPI, SC heparin
