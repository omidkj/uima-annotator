History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 107101**] is a 49-year-old gravida 0 woman who reports a long
history of worsening irregular menstrual cycles.  She reports
that her cycles became quite
irregular with heavy bleeding at times.  This led to a pelvic
ultrasound, which revealed an irregularity concerning for the
possibility of a polyp or irregularity within the endometrial
cavity.  The irregular bleeding continued and she delayed care
it looks like for five or six months.  An attempt had at an
endometrial biopsy in the past was associated with severe pain
and so she was somewhat concerned about doing this.  A biopsy
was eventually obtained by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and a grade I
endometrioid adenocarcinoma was identified.  The uterus measured
back in [**Month (only) 1096**] was 8.3 x 3.5 x 4.6 cm.  The endometrial biopsy
was
obtained on [**2126-7-1**]. The decision was made to proceed with
TAH/BSO.

abuse, sleep apnea, morbid obesity, and now the endometrial
cancer.

CXR [**8-13**]
The ET tube tip is 3.3 cm above the carina. The low lung volumes
exaggerate
the size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette which appears to be
slightly
enlarged compared to the prior study. The patient is in mild
volume overload with bilateral pleural effusions demonstrated,
right most likely more than left. No pneumothorax is seen.
.
CXR [**8-15**]
There is increased lower lobe atelectasis and slightly worsened
right middle lobe atelectasis. The mediastinal contour is
obscured by the lung
abnormality. Left lower lobe atelectasis is persistent, if any,
there are
small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CXR [**8-16**]
Since yesterday, aeration in both bases improved. Bilateral
pleural
effusion, if present, are tiny. There are no signs of pulmonary
edema or new focal area of consolidation. Heart size is still
enlarged, could be in part due to patient position and AP
technique. No other change.
.
ECG [**8-16**]
Sinus arrhythmia. Non-specific T wave change in leads III and
aVF.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2126-8-5**] the P wave is less
peaked

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 107101**] is a 49yo presented for planned TAH/BSO for
endometrial cancer. In the preop holding area, the anesthesia
team evaluated the pt and noted that her oxygen saturation at
baseline was 90%.  She had audible wheezes throughout the room.
By her own admission, she has been smoking more than she has in
the past.  She denies any fever.  Incentive spirometry was given
to the patient, but despite this, her oxygen saturation remained
low.  There was a concern for the possibility of an inability to
wean the ventilator upon completion of surgery and again the
possibility of pulmonary issues postoperatively. Because of this
concern, her planned surgery was cancelled. As it was not
initially clear when the procedure could be rescheduled, the
patient was consented for and underwent placement of a Mirena
IUD. The Mirena IUD has been shown to be somewhat effective in
treating some endometrial cancers, but in this case, it is more
of a temporizing [**Doctor Last Name 360**] given her significant vaginal bleeding.
.
The decision was then made to admit the patient for optimization
of her pulmonary status. One main goal of this hospitalization
was to prevent the patient from smoking as much as she had been.
She was given a nicotine patch and a pulmonology consultation
was obtained. Her medications were optimized, with the addition
of a course of steroids and 7 days of levoquin, which she
completed. On HD#2, her case was discussed with the attending
anesthesiologist who had initially assessed her. He agreed that
after 4-5 days of steroids, antibiotics, oxygen therapy, and not
smoking, she would likely be more stable to complete the
initially planned procedure. It was thus scheduled for HD#6.
.
As her glucose fingersticks were extremely high, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
consult was obtained for optimization of diabetes medications.
Actos was discontinued and lantus was added, along with a more
aggressive insulin sliding scale. Her FS were subsequently much
improved.
.
On HD#6, Ms. [**Known lastname 107101**] was taken to the operating room, where
TAH/BSO was performed. Please see the operative note for full
details on this uncomplicated procedure. Postoperatively,
extubation was not attempted secondary to her poor respiratory
status and she w
