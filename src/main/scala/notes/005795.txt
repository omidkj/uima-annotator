Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5119**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
History and physical is as per admitting ICU resident, Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 6133**]

This is a 49 year-old male with a history of achondroplasia,
HTN, diastolic CHF, chronic lymphedema, obstructive sleep apnea,
who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after treatment
hypercapneic respiratory failure, pneumonia and cellulitis now
presents with fevers and hypotension. While at [**Hospital1 49145**], patient was noted to be febrile and found to have
blood pressure with systolic in 70s. He was transferred to
[**Hospital 1263**] hospital where he was noted to have acute renal failure
with creatinine of 1.9 (baseline 0.5-0.7) and he received [**3-8**]
litres IV fluids for presumed dehydration, with improvement in
the blood pressure to systolic 90s. He was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] per request of the family, given his recent treatment
here.
.
During his last admission, patient [**Last Name (un) 19692**] intubated in ED for
hypercarbic respiratory failure. Due to copious secretions after
intubation, patient was treated with Vancomycin, levofloxacin,
metronidazole from [**Date range (1) 79435**] and completed an 8-day course for
presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia. There was also a
question of cellulitis that was presumably also covered by above
antibiotics.
.
Also of note, patient's anti-hypertensive regimen was
dramatically uptitrated while he was intubated. His original
regimen consisted only of metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]. While he was
intubated, he was hypertensive on his home regimen, so captopril
was added, initially at a dose of 12.5mg TID, then continually
uptitrated to 37.5mg TID. He was then changed to lisinopril 40mg
daily prior to discharge. He was also started on terazosin on
the previous admission, and had been changed to doxazosin at [**Hospital1 15454**].

Brief Hospital Course:
While  in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient management/plan was as follows:

The patient is a 49 year-old male with a history of diastolic
CHF, obstructive sleep apnea and recent treatment for pneumonia
and cellulitis who was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for fevers and
hypotension.

# Hypotension - Likely secondary to dehydration.  Pt responded
appropriately to IVF hydration.  The differential also included
sepsis, given history of fever to 102.  However, patient did not
have a leukocytosis on presentation to OSH, his chest x-ray was
also not markedly different from prior film, and his urinalysis
was negative.  This makes sepsis much less likely. While in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
his temps were monitored and IVFs given to keep MAP > 65, and
his metoprolol, lisinopril and doxazosin were temporarily held.
After hydration the patient became hypertensive with systolic
blood pressures in the 160s.  His blood pressure medications
were gradually reintroduced at lower doses.  His BP medication
should be montitored and gradually adjusted as an outpatient.

# Fevers - Unclear etiology.  No leukocytosis.  Patient does
complain of cough and diarrhea.  Appears that cough is chronic
based on medical reports in system. Patient treated with
Vanc/Levo for question of possible hosptial-acquired PNA.  Based
on [**9-6**] 2 view CXR and history of temps, decision made to
continue antibiotics for a 8 day total course of vancomycin and
5 day course of levaquin.  Treated cough symptoms with
benzonatate and guaifenesin/dextramethorphan, and albuterol PRN.
 Pt had PICC line placed [**2133-9-7**] so that he couldcomplete his
antibiotic course at rehab.  The line should be removed as soon
as the course is completed.  Flagyl was initally started in the
ICU while c. diff studies were pending (and the etiology of
fever was unclear).  The patient did not have diarrhea and c
diff cultures were negative so Flagyl was stopped.
.
# Skin breakdown:  Skin breakdown was noted on the patients
back.  Pt has been receiving Sarna lotion and Miconazole powder
to affected areas.  The pt was given a pressure-relief mattress.
 the patient should continue to be followed by wound care at his
extended care facility.
.
# Acute Renal Failure-Resolved with IVF hydration.
.
# OSA/OHS - Pt likely has OSA/OHS based on pt desatuarting
during nighttime.  Pt will need sleep study as outpatient for
formal diagnosis.
.
# BPH - Patient was restarted on doxazosin when blood pressure
was stable.
.
# Deconditioning - the pt will be disharged to inpatient rehab
to work on his deconditioned state.
.
#F/E/N:  Cardiac heart healthy diet was given.
.
#Prophylaxis:  Heparin given for DVT prevention
.
#Code:  Full code
