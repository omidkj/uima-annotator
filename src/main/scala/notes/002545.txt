Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope

-Central Venous Line Placement
-Dialysis Line Placement


History of Present Illness:
61M transferred from [**Hospital3 26615**] hospital with CAD s/p 3V CABG
and AVR @ [**Hospital3 2358**] [**4-/2121**] (90% distal left main extending to
LAD and ostium of LCX with 80% mid-RCA) for NSTEMI, s/p DDD
pacer implant for intermittent complete heart block @ [**Hospital1 3343**] [**9-/2122**] transferred from OSH for evaluation and
management of VT with HD instability requiring shocks x 1. He
was admitted to OSH after being started back on metoprolol which
caused him symptoms of light-headedness, lethargy, and mental
slowing (which he had previously experienced leading him to stop
taking metoprolol and lisinopril). He stopped the medication
himself and began to feel better but became extremely SOB when
walking up stairs and ended up lying on the floor due to his
inability to catch his breath which prompted him to call 911 and
present to OSH. He was assessed has possibly having ACS and
underwent ROMI with trops <0.03 -> 0.16 -> 0.12, negative MB's
throughout and EKG with pacer rhythm and 100% capture. He was
started on ASA 325, given lovenox 1mg/kg SQ.
.
Then rapid response was called at 3am today at OSH for VT with
HR to 280 with pt found to be diaphoretic and dyspneic but then
uresponsive for 5 seconds. VT self-teriminated after 2 minutes
and pt started on amiodarone drip @ 3:30AM, crit found to be 26
(stable from admission)and rec'd 1u pRBCs and trop drawn and
found to be 0.14.  Later went into monomorphic VT with rate in
the 250's @ 11:45AM, shocked x 1 with return to paced rate of 88
and was apparently neurologically intact and AOx3 following. He
was transferred to the ICU and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and treatment.
.
On the floor he describes shaking chills occasionally over the
past 3 weeks after having his pacemaker placed although he
denies frank fevers. He also denies pain, redness, or drainage
from the site of his pacemaker. He also describes having a cough
over the past week but states it is non-productive.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for dyspnea on exertion,
negative for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, negative for
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.

ECHO [**2122-11-2**]
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Two
pacemaker leads are seen entering the right atrium from the SVC,
without definite associated vegetations. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. A mechanical
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The anterior attachment of
the prosthesis is normal. The posterior half of the prosthesis
appears hypermobile/partial dehiscence extending nearly [**12-14**] way
around the prosthesis (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). An echolucent space is seen
posteriorly with systolic flow into this space which is then
contiguous with the right atrium with continus flow (aorta to
right atrial fistula). There are mobile echodensities (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **],
84) seen at the posterior attachment site of the prosthesis c/w
tissue, sutures and/or vegetations. No aortic regurgitation is
seen through this area. There is trivial valvular aortic
regurgitation (normal for this prosthesis). The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

IMPRESSION: Partially posterior aortic valve prosthesis
dehiscence with flow from the aorta into the right atrium.
Vegetations vs. suture vs. tissue in the area.Moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation.
.
RUQ US [**2122-11-2**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Mildly coarsened hepatic echotexture. No frank biliary
dilatation.
2. A few peripheral echogenic foci in the liver likely represent
small portal branches; however, portal venous gas cannot be
entirely excluded. If there is clinical concern for ischemic
bowel, further assessment should be performed with CT.
3. Diffuse gallbladder wall thickening.
4. Splenomegaly to 15 cm.
.
KUB [**2122-11-1**]
FINDINGS: Two supine and one left lateral decubitus image show
no evidence of free air. There are air-filled loops of
nondilated small bowel. There is air and stool seen within the
colon extending into the sigmoid and rectum. There is no
evidence of obstruction or ileus. Patient is status post a total
left hip arthroplasty with no evidence of loosening. There are
degenerative changes of L4 and L5 in the right hip. The bases of
the lungs are clear.  Sternotomy wires and pacemaker wires are
seen within the chest.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction or ileus.
.
KUB [**2122-11-2**]
FINDINGS: Three supine frontal images of the abdomen show newly
dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 3.4 cm in the left
upper quadrant. Given history of recent arrest, the dilation may
be secondary to ischemia. Could also consider the possibility of
an early or partial small-bowel obstruction. There is no obvious
free air, although exam is somewhat limited due to supine
positioning. There has been interval placement of a femoral line
on the right groin. A catheter overlies the left upper quadrant,
and is likely external to the patient. Again noted is dense
calcification of the aorta and iliac vessels. A left total hip
arthroplasty is unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
Interval increasing dilation of air-filled loops of small bowel
loops raises concern for ischemia.
