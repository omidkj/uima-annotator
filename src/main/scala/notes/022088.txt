Admission Date:  [**2134-7-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2134-8-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2062-5-6**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDTHORAC

The patient is a postoperative admission.  She was first seen
by the Vascular Surgery Service followed by Cardiothoracic
Surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient underwent a cardiac
catheterization on [**2134-4-26**], for angioplasty and stenting
of the right coronary artery which was unsuccessful.  During
that admission her course was complicated by a
retroperitoneal bleed for which she underwent an emergent
left femoral endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty
after an iliac stent was placed for acute leg ischemia
followed by a large left retroperitoneal hematoma.  The
patient was advised following cardiac catheterization that
her significant coronary artery disease was not amenable to
angioplasty and she was advised to have coronary bypass.  She
was also known at that time to have left carotid stenosis of
80-99% with no symptoms of transient ischemia or stroke.  She
is to be admitted at this time for right carotid
endarterectomy followed by coronary artery bypass grafting.
In the preoperative admission testing area her physical
examination is as follows:

Vital signs:  Heart rate 71, blood pressure 177/74,
respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
Height is 5'2", weight is 215 pounds.  General:  A pleasant
woman in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Sclerae
anicteric.  No lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to
auscultation.  Cardiac:  Normal S1, S2.  No murmurs or rubs.
Abdomen is round, soft, non-tender.  No masses, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities with no edema.  Positive
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  Well-healed scar of the
left groin.  Firm nodular left groin.  Neuro:  Cranial nerves
II through XII grossly intact.  Muscle strength in the upper
extremities [**4-26**] bilaterally.  Lower extremities [**4-26**]
bilaterally.  Sensation is intact.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus,
asthma, dyspepsia, arthritis, emphysema, carotid stenosis on
the left 80-99% and on the right 30-80%.  Cardiac
catheterization on [**4-24**] showed severe three vessel disease
with an ejection fraction of 55%.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Include:
1.  Aspirin 81 q. day.
2.  Synthroid 112 mcg q. day.
3.  Lopressor 150 mg b.i.d.
4.  Zestril 20 mg q. day.
5.  Combivent two puffs b.i.d.
6.  Flovent two puffs b.i.d.
7.  Plavix 75 q. day.
8.  Lescol 80 q. day.
9.  Naprosyn 500 p.r.n.
10. Miacalcin nasal spray.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was a direct admission to the
Operating Room on [**2134-7-27**], at which time she underwent
a right carotid endarterectomy.  Please see the Operating
Room for full details.  In summary, the patient had a right
carotid endarterectomy with shunt Dacron patch done by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  She tolerated the operation well and was
transferred to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit.  She did
well in the immediate postoperative period.  She remained
hemodynamically stable with a grossly normal neurological
examination.  She remained in the Vascular Intensive Care
Unit for two days and on postoperative day two she was
transferred from the Vascular Intensive Care Unit to the
floor for continuing postoperative care.  Also on
postoperative day two the patient was seen and assessed by
Cardiothoracic Surgery and scheduled for coronary artery
bypass grafting.  On [**7-30**] the patient was taken to the
Operating Room by Cardiothoracic Surgery at which time she
underwent an off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting times
two.  Please see the OR report for full details.  In summary,
the patient had an off-pump CABG times two with the left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary
artery.  She tolerated the operation well and was transferred
from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit.  At the time of transfer the patient was in normal
sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute with a CVP of 6 and a
mean arterial pressure of 45.  She had propofol at 20
mcg/kg/min and Neo-Synephrine at 0.4 mcg/kg/min.  The patient
did well in the immediate postoperative period.  Her
anesthesia was reversed.  She was successfully extubated.
She remained hemodynamically stable throughout the day of
surgery by remained in the Intensive Care Unit because
intravenous nitroglycerin was required to control her blood
pressure.  On postoperative day two the patient continued to
have requirement for intravenous nitroglycerin.  On
postoperative day three the patient was brought to the
Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for planned stenting of
her ramus stenosis.  Please see the Catheterization
Laboratory report for full details.  In summary, the patient
had a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
successful stenting of a ramus stenosis.  Following cardiac
catheterization, the patient was transferred back to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  The patient remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the rest of the day and the
following morning the patient was transferred to the floor
for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Over the next two days with the assistance of the nursing
staff and Physical Therapy, the patient's activity level was
increased and on postoperative day six from her cardiac
surgery and nine from her vascular surgery, it was decided
that the patient was stable and ready to be transferred to
rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care.  At the
time of transfer the patient's physical examination was as
follows:

Vital signs:  Temperature 97.6, heart rate 72, blood pressure
128/64, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 94% on room
air.  Weight preoperatively 98.1 kilograms, at discharge
101.3 kilograms.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 11, hematocrit 29, platelet
count 235,000.  Sodium 136, potassium 3.9, chloride 102, CO2
