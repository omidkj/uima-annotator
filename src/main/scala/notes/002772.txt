Echo: [**2189-8-13**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-8-4**],
the LV walls are better seen. The inferolateral wall thickness
is normal. There is discrete upper septal hypertrophy - coupled
with the hyperdynamic LV systolic function, there is functional
LVOT obstruction with a small gradient. Hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy cannot be excluded. The degree of mitral
regurgitation has increased slightly. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressures have increased.

CXR: [**2189-8-13**]

COMPARISON: [**2189-8-12**].

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis, unchanged right
suprabasal
atelectasis. Unchanged mild enlargement of the right hilar
structures,
presumably due to vascular crowding. No newly appeared focal
parenchymal
opacity, no evidence of overhydration, no pneumothorax.

RUQ US [**2189-8-3**] : IMPRESSION:
1. The sum of son[**Name (NI) 493**] and CT findings are concerning for
acute
cholecystitis. No biliary dilatation.
2. Pancreas not visualized

[**2189-8-3**] Abd CT :IMPRESSIONS:
1. Together with same-day son[**Name (NI) 493**] findings, CT findings are
concerning for acute cholecystitis.
2. Pancreatic cyst and vague hypodense area are likely
incidental findings.
These are incompletely evaluated and may be further assessed
with IV contrast
after resolution of acute symptoms.
2. Small hiatal hernia. Bilateral fat-containing inguinal
hernias.
3. Atherosclerotic disease with coronary artery disease.

[**2189-8-3**] ERCP : Impression: Stone and sludge in biliary tree on
cholangiography.
Successful biliary sphincterotomy performed.
One stone and sludge with a small amount of pus was retrieved
from the biliary tree using a 12mm balloon
(sphincterotomy, stone extraction)
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

[**2189-8-4**] Cardiac echo: Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**8-5**] /09 Abdominal CT: IMPRESSION:

1. Mild pancreatitis with likely beginning pseudocyst formation
posterior to
the body of the pancreas

2. Cystic lesions in the head of the pancreas are likely
incidental and may represent IPMN. Follow- up in 6 months is
recommended to ensure stability.
this could be performed with MRI.

3. Acute cholecystitis with hyperemia of the adjacent liver
parenchyma



Brief Hospital Course:
1. Gallstone pancreatitis and Choledocholithiasis: Patient
initially transferred from OSH with symptoms of biliary
obstruction (elevated LFTs and total bilirubin of 9.4) and
pancreatitis.  Patient was placed on Unasyn, made NPO and
hydrated with IVF.  Patient underwent ERCP with spincterectomy
and extraction of multiple stones on [**8-3**].  Abdominal pain
improved and patient placed on clear diet which he tolerated
well.  WBC count decreased from 21.4 on admission to 12.9
following ERCP.  On [**8-9**], patient was taken back to the
operating room for laproscopic cholecystectomy.  Surgery was
reportedly technically difficult and significant venous oozing
of the liver bed was observed.  He was transferred back to the
general surgery floor [**8-11**].  Postoperative course with numberous
complications including acute on chronic renal failure, acute
anemia, acute respiratory distress and rising WBC count (all
outlined below).  By time of discharge, biliary obstruction had
subjectively and objectively improved.  LFTs had trended down,
total bilirubin was 1.4 and patient was tolerating oral intake.
His port sites were dry and healing well.

Of note, on his initial abdominal CT a pancreatic cyst/mass was
noted at the junction of the head and the body thus prompting a
repeat abdominal CT with pancreatic protocol.  His repeat CT
scan noted that the cyst was an incidenental finding and should
be followed in 6 months with a repeat scan or MRI.

2. Labile HTN: Throughout hospital course, patient had labile
HTN with systolic BP rising to as high as 180s- 200s, prompting
multiple changes in BP management.  Initially, patient was
continued on his home verapamil SR 240mg daily although his ACEI
was held secondary to creatinine of 2.1 (see below). Labetolol
was added temporarily prior to lap cholecystectomy.
Postoperatively, patient was on verapamil only and had markedly
elevated blood pressure to 170-180s on [**8-12**].  At this point,
patient developed acute respiratory distress most likely
