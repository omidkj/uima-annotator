History of Present Illness:
HPI:

78yo woman with history of HTN, DM2, GI bleeding,
and spinal stenosis presented to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital
with nausea/vomiting/diarrhea for 3 days. On admit to Caritas
ED, her vitals were 97.3, 65, 20, 134/51, and 100% on RA.
There, she underwent CT of abdomen with oral contrast, which
was read as significant for the following: small hiatal hernia,
markedly distended stomach with distal gastric wall thickening
(inflammation vs. infectious process), small amount of ascites,
s/p cholecystectomy, moderate amt of stool in colon, apparent
thickning of rectal wall, "possible thickening of the large
bowel wall, but not certain due to lack of oral contrast".  She
was also diagnosed with
urinary tract infection. At Caritas ED, she was given volume
resuscitation with NS 2L, levaquin 500mg, Dilaudid 0.5mg  x 2,
reglan, pepcid, and ativan. She had WBC count of 23.9, UA with
mod blood, 30 prot, Lg LE, numerous WBC.
.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was afebrile, hemodynamically
stable
and a/o x 3.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she quickly was noted to be apneic,
with right facial droop, and slumping over to right side.
She was apneic and cyanotic. She was intubated. Given
3L NS for hypotension. Given Vancomycin 1g, levaquin 500mg IV,
and flagyl 500mg IV.  She was given 3amps of bicarbonate. Given
Insulin,
D50, kayexalate, HCO3 for hyperkalemia.
.
Abdominal CT reviewed by Surgery and Radiology, who both
feel that the CT clearly reveals some mucosal thickening, which
could be consistent with C. Diff colitis.
.
Discussion with her family reveals that she has been in and out
of [**Hospital **] hospital and Rehab for significant GI bleed from UGI
ulcer one month ago, has had CHF, and has had C. diff colitis;
has
completed 8 day course of flagyl.  She had returned to home
from rehab and was doing well, but then complained of mild
nausea/vomiting/diarrhea for past 3 days.

Brief Hospital Course:
78yo woman with complicated medical history presented from
outside
hospital with sepsis, and likely lactic acidosis from bowel
ischemia.
She was aggressively managed with volume resuscitation,
pressors,
broad spectrum antibiotics, and mechanical ventilaiton in the
intensive care unit.
.
Over her course, she had worsening hypotension and increasing
pressor requirements. Ultimately, family meeting was held,
and it was decided to make her comfort measures only. She
thereafter
passed away. A post-mortem examination will be performed per
the family's request.
