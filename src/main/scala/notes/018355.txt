TUNNELED LEFT FEMORAL LINE PLACEMENT


History of Present Illness:
51 year old female with history of Insulin dependent DM s/p
Kidney Transplant x3, Pancreas transplant x2, orthostatic
hypotension, CIDP on IVIG, severe PVD with tunneled femoral line
presented via EMS after calling out for help to the janitor in
her building who then called 911. The patient had been in her
usual state of health (per the husband) although complained of
some sinus congestion over the past few weeks. She does not
remember the events today other then calling for help. When EMS
arrived she was mentating fine but hypotensive to 90s, HR 150s
and fever 100.3. On arrival to ED has had normal mental status
but moaning, rigoring and uncomfortable. Vitals on admission to
ED were T100.3 HR 136 BP 127/85 RR 21 98%RA. Labs notable for
WBC 3.6, Lactate 3.0 CK 18. She received 3L IVF, Imipenem; and
125mg Methylprednisolone. CT abdomen/pelvis negative, CT
Head/neck notable for maxillary sinusitis, renal transplant
ultrasound neg, U/A negative, blood cultures were sent.
.
After fluid rescucitation pts BP improved initially to SBP 130s
but drifted back to 110s; HR improved from 150->109 O2 sat
97%RA. She was subsequently admitted to the MICU for further
management.
.
Currently, the patient [**First Name3 (LF) **] any pain. She does not remember
any of the events that occured today. She [**First Name3 (LF) **] any
lightheadedness, palpitations prior to the event. She does
report sinus congestion which has required use of nasal steroids
over past few days. She reports purulent drainage from ostomy
that has been seen by her ostomy nurse. [**First Name (Titles) 4273**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5162**]/chills.
She [**Last Name (Titles) **] any CP, SOB, abdominal pain, urinary frequency, does
report large volume stools unchanged from the past few months.
Reports normal appetite.

CT HEAD: (PRELIM READ)
No intracranial hemorrhage or edema. No fracture. Bilateral
maxillary sinus disease concerning for acute sinusitis.

CT CSPINE: (PRELIM READ)
1. No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
2. Multilevel degenerative disc disease, particularly at C4-5
and C5-6,
similar to MRI [**2134-5-24**].

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS:
1. Cholelithiasis.
2. Suboptimal evaluation of bowel just proximal to the left
lower quadrant
ostomy due to the lack of oral contrast and post-operative
anatomy; therefore, infection is impossible to exclude.

RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT US:
Normal resistive indices and waveforms with no evidence of
hydronephrosis.

Somewhat limited exam and main renal artery could not be
assessed.

TTE: Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.

An 3.7 cm long echogenic mass is present in the inferior vena
cava extending past the orifice of the cava, approximately 1 cm
into the right atrium. This most likely represents thrombus

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2135-1-19**], the mass present in the right atrium is
significantly reduced in size, and is now seen to be contiguous
with mass in the inferior vena cava, most likely representing
thrombus.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo female s/p renal tx X3 (most recent CRT [**9-29**]) and panc X2
(most recent [**2-27**]), severe PVD, HTN presents with rigors/[**Month/Year (2) 5162**]
and mental status changes.

# Sepsis / GPC Bactermia: Patient presented with fever,
tachycardia and hypotension. initial evaluation with CXR
negative, CT abdomen unrevealing, U/A negative, Renal Ultrasound
unrevealing, Lactate 2.0, LFTs unremarkable. Patient does have
history of VRE Peritonitis as well as an indwelling tunneled
femoral line which was suspected as most likely source; CT did
show maxillary sinusitis and pt did have recent complain of a
persistant "head cold" per her husband. On day #1 patients blood
cultures grew GPCs later speciated to CoNS,
methicillin-resistant.  She was treated initially with
Vancomycin and Imipenem but this was subsequently narrowed to
vancomycin only.  Her tunneled line was removed and a new left
femoral line was placed.  Ideally, we would have had a line-free
period in which her blood cultures would clear, but owing to
very difficult IV access the left femoral line was replaced the
same day as the prior line.  Blood cultures promptly cleared the
day that the old femoral line was pulled.  In addition, a TTE
was done which showed a thrombus in her right atrium.  She will
continue vancomycin for a four week course and follow up with ID
in transplant clinic.
.
# Mental Status change- Patient with acute MS changes although
events not clear at this time. Per her husband, pt has altered
MS every time her BP drops. BP was low on EMS arrival. Pt does
have labile BPs and takes both BB and fludrocortisone prn to
manage her pressures. It is possible that infection
precipitation hypotension causing the MS changes. CT head was
negative. MS improved upon arrial to ICU with control of BP.
.
# Right Atrial thrombus - Pt had TTE done given positive blood
cultures; thrombus in RA and IVD found; started on heparin,
