History of Present Illness:
This is a 29-year-old woman who is an active IV drug user, s/p
tricuspid valve replacement(29mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic), mitral valve
repair (P2 resection,26mm CG Future Ring) for MSSA endocarditis
on [**1-/2188**] (course complicated by septic emboli to the brain and
lungs) who presents with relapse of drug abuse and septic shock.
.
The patient was reportedly last heard normal on [**2188-7-23**] when
talking to her mother on the phone.  She lives with her
boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] and on [**2188-7-25**] he noticed "odd behavior"
described as combative and aggressive thus called the
paramedics.  It is unclear when she restarted using IV drugs
after admission this [**Month (only) 404**], likely since [**Month (only) 958**]. Per MICU note,
she had been using cocaine and heroin on [**2188-7-24**]. When EMS
arrived, the patient's HR was 150 and SBP 100, and she was given
ativan x2 without effect.
.
Upon arrivival at [**Hospital6 3105**] ED, her BP was 89/73
with HR 118 (lowest recorded BP was 54/40). Labs were remarkable
for creatinine of 5.2. WBC 2.4, Hct 38.2, Plt 32. Troponin I was
0.135, INR 3.9. She was given 1mg narcan, 750mg levaquin, 1g
vancomycin, geodon 20mg and 25mg diphenhydramine and 100mg
hydrocortisone. She was started on a levophed drip.  Prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], a right femoral central line was placed. She
had a beside TTE that showed no pericardial effusion, intact
TVR, no MR. ECG shows ventricular pacing at 104.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, the patient was reported to be
quite agitated. Vitals were HR 122, BP 104/89, T 97.6, satting
99% RA on 0.12mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine. She was confused and
thought that every person who entered the room was her boyfriend
[**Name (NI) **] and was unable to answer any other questions.
.
During her stay in the MICU, she was continued on norepinephrine
drip, bolused with fluids, and treated with vanc/cefepime
initially then switched to gent/nafcillin for septic shock
(blood cultures from OSH grew staph aureus, suspecitble to
oxacillin, resistant to penicillin G.) TEE showed vegetation on
tricuspid valve, normal valve otherwise, no vegetations on
pacemaker, no abnormalities on mitral valve. She was seen by
cardiothoracic surgery who did not think there was indication
for surgical intervention. Given low urine output at OSH
concerning for septic emboli (vs. pre-renal --> ATN), renal
ultrasound was obtained (without Doppler) which was normal.
Renal was consulted and thought etiology was likely ATN and
recommended PRN lasix for volume overload. She had a stat head
CT given AMS which showed possible new hypodensities in R
parietal and L cerebellar areas (patient can't get MRI due to
pacemaker).  INR was 5 on admission thus [**Name (NI) **] was stopped
and patient was given PO vitamin K 2.5 mg to reverse INR to try
to prevent septic emboli bleeding in brain.  She was intubated
on [**7-26**], extubated on [**7-27**] without complications. Following
extubation, she had [**10-22**] full-body pain and was put on [**Doctor Last Name **]
scale with Librium.  Speech and swallow cleared her for regular
diet.  Prior to transfer, mental status was near baseline and
patient was hemodynamically stable (BPs 90s/60s).


Past Medical History:

A. Tricuspid valve replacement with a size #29-mm [**Company 1543**]
Mosaic tissue valve.
B. Mitral valve repair with resection of P2 and repair with
size #26 CG Future band.
-completed 6wk course of nafcillin on [**3-5**] at [**Hospital1 **], post-op
course c/b septic emboli to lungs and brain for which she was
anticoagulated.
2. 3rd degree heart block: s/p pacemaker placement on [**2188-3-27**]
with [**Company 2267**] Altrua model S606 dual-chamber pacemaker
3. Anxiety
4. Asthma


Social History:
patient lives with fiance [**Doctor Last Name **] (arrested on outstanding warrant
