Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**]
Chief Complaint:
Left-sided weakness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 36756**] is an 81 year-old right-handed cigarette
smoker with a longstanding history of HTN, HL and CKD III-IV,
who
presents with acute-onset Left-sided weakness while using the
toilet this morning around *7:45am*. He said while on the
toilet,
he had nausea and dry heaves, which he has been experiencing
every morning for several weeks now (his son thinks this is
secondary to a recent increase in the dose of one of his
medications, but not sure which one). He "slid" off the toilet
before he could wipe, and called his son to help him back up
because he realized "everything wasn't workin" meaning that his
left arm and leg were paralyzed. After finishing his business on
the toilet, he asked his son to call EMS, who took him to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED. No HA at any time. No sensory changes or paresthesias.
No dysarthria or altered level of arousal at any time. No
fever/sweats/chills. No diarrhea. No CP or SOB. ROS +for nausea
and vomiting, as noted above.

He arrived via ambulance and a code stroke was called at 8:37am.
We rapidly assessed the patient and he was found to have left
arm
and shoulder weakness (trap/delt/[**Hospital1 **]/tri) with preserved grip
strength as well as left leg weakness with complete paralysis of
all LLE muscles except hamstrings, which were 2-3/5. There was
no
sensory loss on my exam at the CT scanner.

Physical Exam:
Mental Status exam:

Awake and alert spontaneously. Oriented to person, year, month,
date, day of week, season, city, location, reason for treatment.
Able to relate history without difficulty. Attentive. Speech
sounded dysarthric vs. raspy from smoking Hx (patient and son
insist this is how he normally sounds). Repetition was intact.
Language is fluent with intact repetition and comprehension,
normal prosody, and normal affect. There were no paraphasic
errors. Able to read and write without difficulty. Naming is
intact to low and medium frequency objects, impaired to
high-frequency objects. Memory - registers 3 objects and recalls
[**1-20**] at 5 minutes. There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect or
ideomotor apraxia; the patient was able to reproduce and
recognize hammering a nail and brushing teeth with both hands.
There was no evidence of left-right confusion as the patient was
able to accurrately follow the instruction to tough left ear
with
right hand. Calculation was intact (answers seven quarters in
$1.75).

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL, 3 to 2mm and brisk. Visual fields are full.
III, IV, VI: EOMs full. No nystagmus. No saccadic intrusion
during smooth pursuits. Normal saccades.
V: Facial sensation intact and subjectively symmetric to light
touch V1-V2-V3.
VII: Slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold. No ptosis.
Brow elevation is symmetric. Eye closure is strong and
symmetric.
Mild left NLF depresion with smile, otherwise symmetric facial
elevation.
VIII: Hearing intact and subjectively equal to finger-rub
bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: 0/5 LEFT trapezius (right is full).
XII: Tongue protrusion is midline.

-Motor:
Flaccid right arm. No tremor or faciculations were observed. No
asterixis.

Normal muscle bulk. Flaccid LUE/LLE except for Left hand.

No hypertonicity or spasticity.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular
territorial infarction
detected. If there is continued clinical concern, an MRI with
diffusion-weighted imaging can be performed.
2. Moderate-to-severe chronic microangiopathic ischemic disease.


MRI/MRA BRAIN
1. Acute/subacute infarction involving the right precentral
gyrus and
paramedian right frontal gyrus without significant surrounding
edema or mass effect.
2. Periventricular and subcortical white matter disease likely
representing the sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic
disease. There is also cortical and central atrophy.
Encephalomalacia involving the bilateral occipital lobes is
likely present, possibly representing sequela of previous
infarction.
3. A midline superior posterior scalp lipoma is present.
4. The MRA of the head and neck is significantly limited due to
motion and
technical factors. No gross flow-limiting stenoses identified.

ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). A mild mid-cavity gradient is
identified. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline
normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened, and
display somewhat reduced systolic excursion, but frank aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
regu
