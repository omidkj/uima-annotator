Micros:

BAL [**2138-9-14**] no growth

CXR:
[**2138-9-20**]:  Again seen is a small- to moderate-sized right
effusion with
underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Chain sutures and
surgical clips at the right base. Previously described right
apical and right medial base
pneumothoraces are likely still present. Diffusely increased
interstitial
markings in the left lung are again seen, as is some increased
retrocardiac density.
[**2138-9-18**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has been
extubated. The nasogastric tube remains in place, constant
position of the
other monitoring and support devices, including the two
right-sided chest
tubes. The extent of the diffuse left parenchymal opacity and
the right lung changes. Unchanged size of the cardiac
silhouette.

CCT [**2138-9-14**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of PE.
2. Moderate right pleural effusion, right pneumothorax (chest
tube in place) and moderate right chest wall subcutaneous
emphysema.
3. Diffuse left lower and upper lobe ground-glass opacities with
interlobular septal thickening and multifocal opacities.
Differential diagnosis includes multifocal pneumonia, pulmonary
hemorrhage, and/or asymmetric edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 46214**] was admitted for Right thoracotomy and right middle
lobe/right
lower lobe [**Hospital1 **] lobectomy with bronchoplastic closure; mediastinal
lymph node dissection; intercostal muscle flap buttress.  She
was extubated in the operating room, monitored in the PACU
overnight for hypovolemia manifested by hypotension requiring
low dose pressors for support.  She was transferred to the SICU
for further monitoring.  Over the next 24 hrs she titrated off
pressors with blood pressures in the 90-100's. She transferred
to the floor on [**2138-9-12**]. She did well until [**2138-9-14**] when she
developed respiratory failure transferred to the SICU for
intubation and bronchoscopy with BAL.  CCT was done and revealed
left-sided pneumonia.  She was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics, Vancomycin, cefepime and Cipro.  Again she was
hypotensive requiring pressors, albumin and IV fluids.  Her
volume status improved over the next 24 hrs and she wean off
pressors.  She slowly improved and was transfer to the floor on
[**2138-9-21**].

Respiratory: extubated [**2138-9-17**].  With aggressive pulmonary
toilet, nebs, incentive spirometer her oxygenation improved 94%
on 3-4L nasal cannula.  She de sats to 88-90% with activity and
would benefit from intensive pulmonary rehab.  Recent spirometry
preoperative FEV1 68% predicted, FEV1/FVC 93% predicted.

Chest-tube: anterior apical and a posterior basilar [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain.
 On [**2129-9-11**] the chest film showed residual right fluid
collection for which a chest tube was placed and drained 260 cc
of serosanguinous fluid then removed on [**2138-9-12**].  The anterior
apical and posterior [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains were placed to bulb suction
and once drainage declined were removed on [**2138-9-19**].

Chest films: she was followed by serial chest films which showed
slowly improving left pulmonary alveolar opacity.  (see above
reports)

Cardiac: she remained in sinus rhythm 90-100.  Once the
hypotension resolved she remained hemodynamically stable with
blood pressures of 110-140's.

GI: PPI and bowel regime.

Nutrition: Doboff was placed on [**2138-9-16**] and tube feeds were
started.  Speech was consulted and on [**2138-9-18**] recommended
Continue with Dobbhoff as primary means of nutrition,hydration,
and medication, small volumes of thin liquids and pureed or
ground solids for comfort/pleasure and 1:1 supervision for all
PO intake until her mental status improved. Speech re-evaluated
her on [**2138-9-22**] and recommended a regular diet with thin liquid
and aspiration precautions. Head of the bed elevated 30 degrees
at all times and up to chair for all meals.  She was seen by
nutrition on [**2138-9-22**] who recommended ensure plus with meals and
encouragement.

Renal: Foley was removed on [**2138-9-22**]. good urine output with
normal renal function.  Her electrolytes were replete as needed.


ID: 7 day course of Vancomycin, Cefepime and Cipro were
completed.  She was pan cultured which were all negative.

Pain: Epidural Bupivacaine and Dilaudid managed by the acute
pain service was removed on [**2138-9-14**].  She was converted to IV
pain medication transition to PO with good control.

Neurologic: She was slow to recover from sedation following
extubation but returned to baseline.  Awake, alert and oriented
with no deficits.

Disposition: she was seen by physical therapy.  She was
discharged to [**Hospital 5503**] [**Hospital **] Hospital [**Telephone/Fax (1) 86783**].
