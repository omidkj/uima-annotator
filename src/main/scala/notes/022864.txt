1.6L NS, 1gm IV ceftriaxone, 5mg IV lopressor x 3, guaifenesin
w/ codeine, and 650mg po tylenol. He was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further monitoring given his labored breathing and abnormal
vital signs. CTA c/w atypical pneumonia. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] his course
consisted of albuterol nebulizer, azithromycin and ceftriaxone
for pneumonia and vancomycin for ankle cellulitis.
.
On ROS, he denies chest/arm/jaw pain, palpitations, LE edema,
orthopnea, or PND. He does report some nausea and decreased po

CTA ([**2185-3-28**])
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.

2. Centrilobular opacities in the right lung most notable in the
superior segment of the right lower lobe and posterior segment
of the right upper lobe with underlying emphysema. Bilateral
peribronchial wall thickening. Differential diagnosis includes
atypical mycobacterium infection versus bronchopneumonia.

3. Hypodense lesion within segment IV of the liver is
incompletely characterized on this examination. Recommend
multiphase liver MRI for further evaluation.

4. Tubular soft tissue density in the region of the left adrenal
gland possibly representing adrenal hyperplasia.

5. Heterogeneous lesion within the left thyroid gland which may
be further evaluated with ultrasound.

6. Scattered mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, the largest of
which measures 1.1 cm in short axis.

CXR [**2185-3-29**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute pneumonia. No pleural effusions
or acute skeletal abnormalities are identified.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia@120BPM,L atrial abnormality, RBBB (new
relative to EKG [**2184-6-15**]) 1mm ST depressions V2-V3, frequent
PVC's.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 83yo M with DM and CAD, in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] 1 day for
respiratory distress due to pneumonia who was stable and
discharged from the floor.
Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Pneumonia: SOB, cough have improved, but are still present. He
has been afebrile since transfer from to the floor but his WBC
was still elevated until [**3-30**] when it was normal. Opacity on
chest CT c/w atypical pna. Also could represent viral
pneumonitis and aspiration. Speech and swallow team evaluated
and cleared for eating as pt has no apparent aspiration risk.
Sputum gram stain polymicrobial (2+GNR, 1+GPC, 1+GPR). CTA
negative for PE. Symptoms and imaging not c/w CHF. This is most
likely community aquired from his residence with multiple
elderly patients. Treated CAP with Azithromycin x 2 day course
(d1 [**3-29**]); CTX x 2d (d1 [**3-29**]). Transitioned to PO Levofloxacin
[**3-31**], will contiue Levo at rehab for 6 days.  Blood cultures,
urinary legionella antigen are pending. CXR [**3-31**] showed
atelectasis. PT evaluated and have recomended physical therapy
in rehabilitation center.
.
# Wheezing: pt w/ 25y h/o pipe smoking, stopped in [**2157**]'s.
Evidence of COPD on CT. Nebs improve breathing according to pt.
Albuterol/atrovent nebs administered in hospital, patient
discharged on albuterol and atrovent inhalers for home use.
.
# Skin lesion: the dry, scaly, mildly erythematous yellow/brown
skin on L ankle is less likely to be cellulitis as it is not
hot, tender or swollen. However, due to his residence at a
facility with many other elderly people MRSA contact is possible
and should be considered. He received three days of IV
Vancomycin and is being discharged with 1% hydrocortisone cream.

.
# Hypertension: pt w/ h/o HTN on amlodipine, lopressor, and
lisinopril, furosamide at home, hypertensive in ED to SBP 200.
Stable on floor w/ home regimen meds, lisinopril was increased
from 20mg to 40mg QD on [**3-30**] due to systolic pressures >135 on
[**3-30**]. Metoprolol also increased to 150mg [**Hospital1 **] for control of HR,
BP tolerating well on discharge.
.
# Tachycardia: Tachy resolved on night of [**3-28**] w/ 500cc NS,
lopressor PM dose, 0.5 mg ativan. Could
