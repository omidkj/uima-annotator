ADDENDUM:  Given the severity of the patient's chronic lung
disease, we were concerned about chronic pulmonary emboli as
a possible cause.  The patient underwent a CT angiogram of
her chest, which revealed extensive emphysematous disease,
but no pulmonary emboli.

There has been a change in the patient's discharge status.
The patient and her family have decided that she should be
discharged to home with VNA and physical therapy assistance
at home.
