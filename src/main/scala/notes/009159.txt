Physical Exam:
Physical Exam on Admission
Vital Signs: T 100.4 HR 143 BP 138/99 RR 24 O2Sat 97% on Vent
General: Intubated and Sedated
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm
Lung: Clear to ausculation bilaterally with decreased breath
sounds on the right lower bases, No crepitus
Abdomen: soft, nondistended, nontender
Injuries: Laceration to the chin, to the Right chest with
eccychomosis, Laceration to the Left forearm, bilateral shins

Pertinent Results:
CXR on [**2161-6-4**]:
1. Multiple right rib fractures, and small associated right
pneumothorax.
2. Widened mediastinum in this patient with significant chest
trauma raises
concern for vascular injury. Further evaluation with CTA is
recommended.
3. Endotracheal tube nearly reaches the right mainstem bronchus.
Recommend
withdrawing tube 2-3 cm for more optimal positioning
.
CT head on [**2161-6-4**]:No acute intracranial process. No evidence
of fracture. Mucosal thickening in paranasal sinuses.
.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis on [**2161-6-4**]:
1. Complex fractures of the pelvis likely unstable with multiple
potential sites of focal extravasation.  Multiple rib fractures.
No definite flail chest. Fracture at left L3 transverse proces,
with focus of likely active extravasation at left erector spine
muscle at L3 level.
2. Resolution effectively of right-sided pneumothorax with
possible traumatic pneumatocele and tip of right-sided chest
tube, which should be withdrawn somewhat. This was discussed at
the time with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3450**]. Bilateral consolidation at lung bases,
with bilateral pleural effusion. Mediastinal hematoma.
Subcutanous emphysema as decribed above.
3. Thickenning of obturator and piriformis muscle, more on
right, likely
traumatic hematoma. Blood in perivesical fat.
4. Choledocholythiasis, and gallstones, with mild intrahepatic
bilary duct
dilatation.
.
CT C-spine: No evidence of misalignment or fracture in the
cervical spine.
.
Left Forearm AP/Lateral film: Non-displaced fracture of the
diaphysis of the radius
.
[**2161-6-5**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve is not well seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2161-6-11**] CT chest:
1. Enlarging left pleural effusion, now moderate to large, still
layering
along the posterior wall but more heterogeneous, could be due to
blood.
Complete collapse of the left lower lobe. Partial collapse of
the left upper lobe with residual aeration of the anterior
segment.
2. Improving mediastinal hematoma.
3. Persistent very tiny right pneumothorax. Pneumoperitoneum.
Persistent
subcutaneous gas collections.
4. Multiple rib fractures.
5. Unchanged small right pleural effusion and adjacent
atelectasis.
6. Contusions along the old right chest tube tract and slightly
below it with no residual cavitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 82486**] was brought in by [**Location (un) **] from the scene at the
hair salon where the patient was sitting inside when a car hit
the hair salon causing the wall to collapse onto the patient.
He was intubated at the scene.  A right chest tube was placed on
the right due a right pneumothorax.  He went to interventional
radiology for bleeding pelvic fracture.  They were able to
emobilize [**2-17**] vessels.  On HD 2 because of the increasing
hemothorax and the fact that he recieved 15 units of PRBCs, 15
units of FFP, 2 units of platelets and 1 unit of Cryoprecipate
and Amicar drip it was decided to put in a posterior chest
