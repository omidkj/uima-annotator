ATTENDING:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 11362**]
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old female,
with a past medical history of severe COPD, home O2
dependent, Paget's disease of her left femur, recently
treated for a pneumonia who presents status post fall with
dyspnea.  The patient states that she was walking at home in
her kitchen when she tripped over the tail of her cat and
fell on her left side.  She denies any antecedent
palpitations, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, or other
symptoms, and states that the fall was mechanical in nature.
She had no loss of consciousness, and denies any tongue
biting or incontinence.  She denies any head trauma, but
states that she was unable to walk or bear weight on her left
side following the fall.  Her son initially helped her to her
feet, and the patient stayed home for some time after the
fall, but as she continued to experience leg pain and was
continuous unable to bear weight, she was brought to the
Emergency Room for further evaluation.

She denies any recent fever, pleuritic chest pain.  She was
on a course of azithromycin for upper respiratory tract
infection several weeks prior to the admission, and had a
cough productive of white sputum for approximately one week.
In the ED, she was noted to have an O2 saturation of 88% on
room air with blood pressures in the 80s-90s and was treated
with albuterol nebs, prednisone 60 mg, ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, aspirin, morphine and lasix.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her family.  She has
an 80 pack year history of smoking and now smokes only
several cigarettes per day.  No alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for a sister with cardiac disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 94.8, pulse
101, blood pressure 96/70, respiratory rate 27, O2 sat found
to be 90% on 40% Venturi mask.  The patient was cachectic,
though in no acute distress.  She was anicteric.
Conjunctivae noninjected.  Mucous membranes dry with no sores
or lesions in the oropharynx.  Neck with no JVD, no
lymphadenopathy and normal range of motion.  Thorax with poor
air movement, though mild expiratory wheezes.  She had a
tachycardic rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, positive
bowel sounds.  No HSM.  Extremities without edema, 1+ pulses.
Mental status exam normal.  Cranial nerves II through XII
intact.  Strength 5+ in the upper and lower extremities,
although the left leg exam was limited by pain.  Normal
sensory examination.  Normal cerebellar examination.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  The patient had a sodium of 135,
potassium 5.3, chloride 98, bicarb 21, BUN 43, creatinine
1.0, glucose 132, white count 19.8, hematocrit 45.7,
platelets 273, INR 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) HIP FRACTURE:  A film of the hip
demonstrates a left intertrochanteric femoral fracture.  The
distal fragment was slightly displaced medially and
superiorly.  There were no other signs of Paget's disease
identified in the visualized osseous structures, other than
slight trabecular thickening adjacent to the left lesser
trochanter.  The patient was felt to be not sufficiently
stable at the time of admission to undergo ORIF and was
intermittently in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
stabilization and treatment of pneumonia (see below).

The patient was taken for ORIF on the [**2-1**].  The
patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient underwent
internal fixation of the previously described
intertrochanteric femoral femur with dynamic screw.
Following hip repair, the patient has been increasingly able
to bear weight on the left, though still with pain on
weightbearing.  The patient was able to ambulate increasingly
with physical therapy, and on the day of discharge was able
to walk approximately 50' with minimal assistance from the
physical therapist.  Her ambulatory sats were in the mid-90%
on 2 liters of oxygen.

2) PULMONARY:  On admission, the patient was felt to have a
pneumonia, and in the ED her O2 sats were in the mid-80s.
Chest film demonstrated diffuse interstitial infiltrates, and
the patient was started on empiric antibiotics, as mentioned
above, for pneumonia/COPD flare, and was given nebs,
steroids, and lasix diuresis.  Her MICU course was notable
for ongoing hypoxia that improved with the empiric treatment.
The patient underwent a CT angiogram on the [**1-30**] that
demonstrated an interval development of a nodular lesion in
the inferior right hilum with associated prominent hilar
nodes that could represent either malignancy or reactive
changes in the setting of pneumonia.  There was no evidence
of pulmonary embolism, and there was extensive bilateral
emphysematous changes that were noted, as well as dependent
atelectasis, consolidation of the lower lobes, and an
abdominal aortic aneurysm that was 3.6 cm in size.

The patient's pulmonary status improved significantly over
the course of her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay, and the
patient continued to improve respiratory wise following
transfer to the medical floor, to the point that she appears
to be at her pulmonary baseline at the time of discharge with
oxygen saturations in the upper 90s on [**12-26**] liters of oxygen,
and as mentioned above with ambulation, sats on 2 liters of
oxygen that were 95% on the day of discharge.  The patient
was continued on azithromycin for 5 days and received 9 days
of ceftriaxone IV as well.

A consult from thoracic surgery was obtained for the nodular
lesion and reactive lymph nodes that were noted on the CT
angiogram.  It was felt that these changes most likely
represent reactive changes in response to infectious illness,
and the patient will follow-up in 6 weeks for repeat CAT scan
to look for interval change.  She will also consider a PET
scan at that time, depending on the results of the CT scan.

3) CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was noted to be hypotensive
on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  An
echocardiogram was obtained and demonstrated dilated right
ventricular cavity with left ventricular cavity size that was
normal.  Left ventricular systolic function appeared grossly
preserved.  There was severe global right ventricular free
wall hypokinesis.  There was also abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload.  There was also moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension, and no pericardial effusion was
seen.  The ejection fraction was not estimated on this study.
Overall, the echocardiographic findings were consistent with
cor pulmonale.

The patient was noted to have an elevated troponin-T on
admission of 0.31 which declined serially to 0.16 on the [**1-29**].  Her CK was 523 and over that time increased slightly
to a maximum of 662 and then declined to 569 with an MB that
decreased from 23 to 15 and MB index that changed from 4.4 to
2.6.  It is possible that the patient had an acute coronary
syndrome prior to admission, though the changes may also
represent stress ischemia and troponin leak rather than acute
coronary syndrome.  The patient initially received aspirin in
the ED, though aspirin was later held in preparation for her
hip repair.  Cardiac consultation was obtained, and the
decision was made not to initiate heparin, as it was felt
that the troponin leak was likely in response to stress
ischemia.  The patient's cardiovascular status improved over
the course of her hospitalization, and the patient was at
baseline at the time of discharge.

4) RENAL FAILURE:  On admission, the patient
