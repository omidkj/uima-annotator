Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE: On arrival to CCU, HD stable w/ SBP in
90s-100s, brady HR 50s, but enlarging L thigh hematoma; HCT 40
=> 34 post-cath on floor => 2 units then; to OR for evacuation
of 25x10 cm, closure. In OR, R DP A-line placed, Swan floated;
TEE w/ 30-35%, [**2-1**]+ MR, antero-apical hypokinesis. Received 5
units pRBC, 5 L LR, EBL 2 L in thigh hematoma => HCT 39.1;
intraoperative hypoTN (not documented) in assx with "SVT."
Transferred back to CCU intubated, sedated. Salvos of NSVT, now
resolved. On return, re-bleed in late PM [**10-8**], [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] seen,
recommended 2 additional U pRBC, 2 U FFP, 6x PLTs, 10 U cryo for
fibro 110 => 10 U cryo to 239. HCT dropped to 26 in early AM
[**10-9**]. Transfused 2 U PRBC, 4 L LR for low UOP and MAP 50s =>
MAPs 75. [**Month/Year (2) **] following, took back to OR [**10-9**] PM; EBL
100cc, evacuated hematoma. POD #1 w/ fever to 102, cultured up,
CXR w/ worsening effusions; hypotensive by A-line, but nl MAP on
cuff. Supported w/ NS 125 and bolus (off now), hydrocort bolus;
abx per [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] on V/L/F day 3 now. Lines d/c; self-limited
episode of AF-RVR to 180s w/ epigastric pain and SBP to 90s on
[**10-11**], treated with amio, back to NSR at 60s.
.
75 yo F with multiple risk factors, anterior STEMI, cath with
100% mid-LAD lesion, non-intervened. No HD or electrical
instability now. Hematoma s/p cordis removal, s/p surgical
closure and evacuation of hematoma.
.
CV: Rhythm:  Arrhythmias: Pt with Afib/Aflutt with RVR. [**Month/Year (2) **]
given dilt IVP, then started on Amio gtt, and  Pt could not get
betablocker given COPD. Discussed with EP re:
cardioversion/ablation of flutter.  TEE performed, no thrombi or
vegetations--cardioverted--remained in NSR since.  Per EP:--will
benefit from ablation, but cannot do as an inpatient due to
horrible access sites (groin hematomas). rec'ed scheduling as an
outpatient.  Pt refused to stay on amiodarone, and did not want
sotalol due to COPD. Discussed with EP, no anti-ar agents until
ablation as an outpatient. Well rate controlled.  Pt will have
an appt. with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as an ouptatient for the ablation.
 Was discharged on diltiazem and digoxin for rate control.
Patient was recommended, but refused to take a higher dose of
diltiazem for rate control.

.
#Ischemia: non-revascularized, s/p STEMI, 100% chronic total
mid-LAD.  intervention was not possible, so that medical
managment of patient's ischemia was recommended. Following the
hematomas, patient agreed to take ASA, but refused to take ASA,
plavix, and lipitor. Pt refused to take BB since she thought
this would aggravate her COPD.
.
Pump: LVEF 45%, 2+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 103777**] on clinical exam,
responded to IV Lasix during inpatient hospitalization.  Patient
continued to refuse ACEIs while in-house
.
#Respiratory distress - multifactorial--CHF, COPD, previously
[**1-31**] Arrythmia.  patient satting 93-100% on 2L NC while on the
floor.  Not on home O2, though recommeded numerous times in the
past.  Currenlty on Prednisone taper down to 5mg PO qd, which is
the patient's home dose for her COPD.

.
# Thigh hematoma: Hct now stable at 30-33. Still putting out
small amount of serosanguinous fluid to drain. 1JP still in,
draining small amount of serosang fluid. On Vanc for
prophylaxis. Vasc surgery still following the drain output.-
.
#. ID: pt has citrobacter freundii--[**Month/Day (2) **] sensitive. pt has been
afebrile, Bx negative. has been on vanco/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] vasc recs.
Now growing Klebsiella, so will treat with 5 day course of
ceftriaxone.
-[**First Name3 (LF) **] x 10 day for ?citrobacter PNA (day 9 now on [**10-18**])
-call vasc [**Doctor First Name **] regarding cont vanc once drains are out?--may be
d/c
ed tomorrow?
-Follow CBC, temp curve; culture for T >101 again.
-Tylenol prn.
.
8. PUD: on PPI
.
9. PPX: PPI, bowel regimen. Add dulcolax suppository prn. We
suggested SQ heparin and Ok'ed it with Dr. [**Name (NI) **], pt's
[**Name (NI) 1106**] surgeon..
