PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69 year-old gentleman who
presented with unstable angina, question myocardial
infarction, to the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2106-12-8**].  He
was transferred emergently to [**Hospital1 188**] where upon arrival he went to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory.  In the catheterization
laboratory the patient was found to have two vessel coronary
artery disease and moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction
and inferior and inferior basilar akinesis with mildly
reduced overall left systolic ventricular function.  While in
the catheterization laboratory he also had successful
placement of a radial stent in the left circumflex.  In
summary, the patient's catheterization results include a 30
percent stenosis of the left main coronary artery at its mid
portion, proximal 80 percent stenosis of the left circumflex,
virtual total occlusion of the right coronary with either
recanalization or good right to right bridging via
collaterals to the distal RCA system.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Height 5 foot, 9 inches, weight 90
kilograms, blood pressure 143/78, pulse 86.  General
appearance: not in any apparent distress.
Alert and oriented times three.  Neck full range of motion,
supple.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac:  S1, S2, no murmur appreciated.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.

PERTINENT LABORATORY AND X-RAY RESULTS:  Please refer to
History of Present Illness.

CO[**Last Name (STitle) 14945**]SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon admission to the
[**Hospital1 69**] patient went to the
catheterization laboratory.  Please see History of Present
Illness for catheterization laboratory results, and then was
transferred emergently to the operating room and Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] for coronary artery bypass graft.  Please see
previously dictated operative note for more details.  The
patient had a coronary artery bypass graft.  The left
internal mammary artery was anastomosed to the left anterior
descending artery.  Saphenous vein graft was used as a
conduit to the OM and saphenous vein graft was used as a
conduit to the PDA.  While in the operating room patient also
received an intra-aortic balloon pump.  Patient left the
operating room with mean arterial pressure of 79, CVP of 8,
PAD of 12, [**Doctor First Name 1052**] of 19, in normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per
minute.  The patient was on propofol and a proteinase drip on
leaving the operating room.

After leaving the operating room patient was transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit.  On postoperative day #1 the patient
was transferred to the patient care floor.  Postoperative day
#2 the patient's chest tubes were discontinued.

On postoperative day #2 the patient went into atrial
fibrillation with a ventricular rate ranging 120 to 130.
This was rectified by repleting electrolytes, giving one unit
of blood and giving patient Lopressor.

Patient's heart rate remained in control and the remainder of
his postoperative course was uneventful.  Pacing wires were
discontinued on postoperative day #3.  The patient went from
atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm and was started on
Coumadin for this.

On postoperative day #5 the patient was ambulating well with
physical therapy, tolerating p.o.s.  Pain was controlled with
p.o. pain medications and felt comfortable going home.
Patient was discharged home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Status post coronary artery bypass graft times three.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. times one
week, KayCiel 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. times one week, Colace 100
mg p.o. b.i.d. while on Percocet, ASA 81 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
ibuprofen 400 to 600 mg p.o. q. 6 hour p.r.n., Lipitor 10 mg
p.o. q.d., Zoloft 50 mg p.o. q.d., Asacol 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.,
Percocet 1 to 2 tabs p.o. q. 4 to 6 hours p.r.n., Lopressor
50 mg p.o. b.i.d., Coumadin dosing to be described.

Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], in three weeks.  In addition the patient will
also follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in three weeks.
