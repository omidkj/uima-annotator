Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
fever and cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p intubation and extubation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 95253**] is an 82 y.o. M with CAD, AAA, CKD, recent GIB
discharged from OSH 5 PTA who presented after he went to his PCP
complaining of subjective fever and productive cough and was
noted to be hypoxic to 90% on RA. He was referred in to the ED.
He also reportedly had some angina on the night prior to
admission which responded to 2 sublingual nitroglycerin.
.
In the ED: Tmax 101.5 HR 57 BP 108/40 RR24 O2 sat 100%4L/
EKG showed regular sinus rhythm @70bpm, diffuse ST twave
abnormalities, no change from prior, and frequent pvcs. Labs
showed a troponin of 0.22 (records show it to be chronically
elevated. He was guaiac negative and was given ASA 325 mg x 1.
CXR showed RLL infiltrate. Vancomycin/Levofloxacin were given.
He then had an episode of hypotension with SBP 80s. RIJ and
a-line were placed, he was started on levophed and he was given
a total of 4L NS. Levophed was weaned off at 4:00am. He was
transfused 2U PRBC for hematocrit 23, with post-transfusion hct
28.  He was then transferred to the floor.

Labs: see OMR
.
STUDIES:
CXR (PA & LATERAL) [**2103-1-8**] (prelim)
CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. The patient
is status post sternotomy and CABG. Mediastinal contours are
unchanged. There is chronic linear opacity at the left lung base
and chronic blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus, presumably
related to post-CABG scarring and pleural thickening. There is
new airspace opacity of the right cardiophrenic angle on the
frontal view, which obscures the right hemidiaphragm consistent
with right lower lobe pneumonia. There is a small right pleural
effusion. The bones are
demineralized. There is no evidence of congestive failure.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
3. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
.
CXR [**2103-1-9**]:
IMPRESSION: Increasing parenchymal density in right lower lobe,
new pneumonic infiltrate in right upper lobe. Probably mild
increased congestion but right-sided infiltrates most likely
infectious rather than atypical unilateral edema.
.
TEE [**2102-11-29**]
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). The right atrial
appendage ejection velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). A small
secundum atrial septal defect is present with left to right flow
at rest. LV systolic function appears depressed. There are
complex (>4mm) non-mobile atheroma in the aortic arch (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]
frame 68). There are diffuse simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta to 45cm beyond the incisors with some areas of
complex, nonmobile atheroma at 37cm (clips 82/83). The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

IMPRESSION: No intra-atrial thrombus identified. Depressed LV
function. Small secundum ASD with left-to-right flow. Simple
aortic atheroma as described above.
.
CARDIAC CATHERIZATION [**2102-10-20**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
was
performed. The LMCA was not injected because it was known to be

diffusely diseased. The LAD was totally occluded proximally.
Distal to the touch down of the LIMA there was mild disease. A
large OM was seen to fill via collaterals. The RCA had widely
patent stents and a distal 40% stenosis.
2. Venous conduit angiography was not performed because all of
the vein grafts were known to be occluded.
3. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a widely patent
LIMA-LAD. There was a 70% proximal subclavian stenosis with a >
20 mmHg gradient.
4. Successful stenting of left subclavian with a 6x24 Genesis
stent
post-dilated to 8mm distally and 9mm proximally. Final
angiography
without complications.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
3. Left subclavian stenosis proximal to takeoff of the LIMA.
4. Successful stenting of left subclavian.

Brief Hospital Course:
When pt arrived on the floor oxygenation was initially stable on
3L nc. However, he soon developed worsening SOB, tachypneia, and
rhonchi on exam. Due to concern for flash pulmonary edema he was
given 100mg IV lasix, but did not put out much urine and hypoxia
did not improve and he required a NRB, and he was transferred to
the MICU.
.
In the MICU he was imediately intubated.  Hypotension continued
despite fluid boluses so was put on levophed.  Vancomycin,
Cefepime, and Ciprofloxacin were given to treat sepsis [**12-16**] PNA.
Oxygenation and BP improved and [**2103-1-11**] he was weaned off
levophed and extubated yesterday.  He was ruled out for
influenza. Renal has been following for Acute on Chronic renal
failure, likely contrast induced.  Because of recent admission
to OSH for GIB Vascular surgery was consulted for concern about
aortoenteric fistula, who felt it unlikely given his stable hct
and guaiac negative.  Further supporting this is that during
admission to OSH 5 days PTA, pt had an EGD and colonoscopy which
were normal.  The vascular team initially recommended abd US to
rule out endo leak since pt was unable to have a contrast study
with his acute on chronic renal failure.  Radiology advised that
US would not be able to properly characterize an endoleak.  When
this was relayed to vascular surgery they felt that the index of
suspicion for aortoenteric fistula was low enough that further
imaging was not necessary. On [**2103-1-12**] he was called out the the
medicine floor.  Just before transfer his feet were noted to be
purple and cold.  Vascular re-evaluated, and noted that it was
dependent and therefore likely due to vascular insuf. and
ischemia was not a
