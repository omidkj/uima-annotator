Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, n/v

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 3175**] is an 85 yo female with history of atrial
fibrillation, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, who presents
with one week of progressive fatigue. She was feeling like her
usual self until [**5-31**] when she sustained a mechanical fall.
She was walking downstairs backwards carrying a meal tray and
slipped and fell when she miscalculated the number of steps. She
hit her head, R shoulder, and R hip. No loss of consciousness,
no LH or dizziness, no incontinence of stool or urine associated
with the fall. She was able to walk the next few days, but had
some pain in shoulder and hip that progressively worsened to
generalized pain all over. Starting on [**6-3**] she began to develop
progressive general fatigue and malaise. This progressed to the
point that yesterday pt was too tired to move out of bed. She
has also had decreased PO intake over this same time period.
This morning, after eating a bowl of cereal she developed nausea
and vomitted x1. She also notes some SOB and mild non-productive
cough that started today. Her husband and son were worried about
her and so brought her to the ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial vitals were: T 101.7, P 92, BP 134/60, RR 20,
O2 sat 88% on RA-->93% on 5L. Her blood pressure dropped as low
as the 80s systolic and she received a total of 2L NS with good
response. Labs were notable for WBC of 11.4 with 96%
neutrophils, lactate of 2.7 (improved to 1.2 after IVF), BNP of
2284, Hct of 26 (baseline low-mid 30s), Na of 128, and Cr 4.3
(from baseline 1.9). CXR showed a new right pleural effusion
along with a right-sided infiltrate. Xrays of the right shoulder
and bilateral hips were negative for fracture. CT head was
negative. Patient was given levofloxacin 750mg PO x 1 and
tylenol 650mg PO x 1. She is being admitted to the ICU for close
monitoring.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she notes feeling a bit shaky and has a
mild non-productive cough. She denies feeling short of breath.

Past Medical History:
Atrial fibrillation (not on anticoagulation)
Hypertension
Congestive Heart Failure
Renal cell carcinoma s/p nephrectomy and radiotherapy
Chronic kidney disease, baseline Cr 1.6-1.7
Rectal ca s/p low ant resection and colostomy

Social History:
Lives at home with her husband and her son. [**Name (NI) 6419**] the patient and
her husband are deaf, but she is able to read lips. Her son is
able to speak sign language. At baseline, she is independent of
all ADLs and overall high functioning. She formerly worked as a
seamstress for the original Filene's store. No history of

Urine legionella antigen: Positive

Culture data
Urine culture ([**2154-6-8**]): no growth
Blood culture: pending x5

Imaging:

Renal U/S of right kidney:
1. No hydronephrosis in the right kidney.
2. Evidence of RFA treated lesion within the right kidney, as
seen on prior MRI. Several small simple renal cysts in the right
kidney, as seen on prior MRI.

Echo ([**2154-6-10**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

AP portable CXR ([**2154-6-10**]): Bilateral pleural effusion, large on
the right and moderate on the left, has increased since [**6-8**].
Lung bases are largely obscured but pneumonia could be present.
Heart is at least mildly enlarged. Left upper lobe is clear.
Right upper lobe vasculature is engorged suggesting a
substantial component of cardiac decompensation.

Chest CT ([**2154-6-10**]): IMPRESSION: Extensive right lower lobe
consolidation and opacity, strongly suggesting pneumonia, with
an accompanying moderate reactive pleural effusion. Minimal
effusion on the left, with adjacent area of atelectasis.
     No evidence of hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, the
other parts of the lung are unremarkable, taking the multiple
motion artifacts into
consideration. No evidence of lymphadenopathy, coronary
calcifications, clips in the left upper abdomen.

U/S of lung to assess for diagnostic purposes: Small area of
fluid in left pleural cavity, not enough to tap.

B LENI:
1. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower
extremity.
2) Cystic lesion in the right groin, likely representing a
lymphocele, which appears stable from the prior CT scan
performed in [**2147**].

Cardiac Echo:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and region
