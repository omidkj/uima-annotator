Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
epigastric pain,vomitting


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 85 y/o F with Myelodysplastic syndrome/RAEB who
presented to an OSH ED with complaints of epigastric pain , N/V.
She was found to have leukocytosis to 28,000 and underwent a CT
abdomen. The CT revealed bilateral lower lobe pneumonia. She was
given 500mg Levaquin and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]. At [**Hospital1 18**], CXR
revealed multifocal air space opacities. She was given
Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin. She remained HD stable, requiring 3
L oxygen by N/C. Also noted to have a Troponin of .44 with a neg
CK and a lactate of 3.8. Currently, she complains of continued
epigastric pain, but denies SOB, cough, chest pain, fever,
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dysuria.

ROS: As mentioned above the patient had pain in abdomen since [**34**]
hours before admission. It was in right as well as left upper
quadrant, no radiation, moderately severe, did not change with
coughing. She did not have it now. However there is tenderness
to palpation on exam in right upper quadrant, more paraumbilical
than subcostal. She did not complain of any nausea (which she
had on admission), vomitting today. She gives h/o diarrhea.
The pt did not have any difficulty or pain in swallowing, no
sensation of food getting stuck in the food pipe.
No complaints of fever, chills, sore throat. She gives h/o mild
cough since last 7 days but no sputum production.
No h/o chest pain. H/o SOB since last 7 days.

CXR ([**2116-7-6**]): A left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads in
appropriate position. There is mild scoliosis. There is mild
cardiomegaly. There are multifocal patchy airspace opacities
predominantly in the right and left lower lobes. There is likely
a small left-sided pleural effusion.
.
ECG: NSR at 85, LAD, Incomplette RBBB, TWI II, III, F, V5, V6
(new), Qwave II, III, F (old),
.
CT ABD (OSH) ([**2116-7-5**]): Distal esophogeal diverticulum vs
ulcerated mass. Severe atheromatous disease in abdominal aorta.
Sigmoid Divericulosis. Bilateral lower lobe airspace disease.
.
Echo [**2116-7-6**]:
EF 30-35%, Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
inferior akinesis, inferolateral hypokinesis, and apical
hypokinesis. Grade III/IV (severe) left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction.



Brief Hospital Course:
85 y/o F with MDS/RAEB who p/w multifocal pneumonia.

* CHF vs. NSTEMI: Elevated Trop in setting of likely heart
failure, unclear whether this represents infarct vs. heart
failure. Peak troponin 0.54, this am down to 0.52. No CK
elevation. Echo this hospitalization reveals 30-35%, severe
diastolic dysfxn, Inf AK, ant apical HK. In comparison to echo
in [**7-15**], concerning for new ischemia, however, Echo in [**2112**],
also shows same WMA. PT was intially admitted to the MICU. SHe
was diuresed as needed. After transfer to the floor she had an
episode of hypotension, with normal EKG, that was thought to be
due to hypovolemia in the context of a Hct of 21. The pt was
given blood and fluids. BP normalized over the next days.
Valsartan was subsequently started at 20mg and then on
Metorpolol at 12.5mg.

* Pneumonia: The bil LL pneumonia was identified on CT abdomen
when pt initially presented at OSH with abdominal pain. The CXR
at [**Hospital1 **] revealed multifocal pneumonia. Urinary legonella
negativeShe was started on Vanc and Ceftriaxone. Vanc discont
after one day and azithro po added. Despite significant chest
xray findings, patient appears relatively stable on 2 liters O2
(earlier on 3 L). CXR ([**7-8**])shows improving consolidation in
right lower lobe, likely pneumonia. Improving edema and
improving left lower lobe atelectasis. F/u CXR in [**6-18**] wks
recomended to see resolution of findings.

* Abdominal pain: Has significant RUQ tenderness. Non-contrast
CT abdomen at OSH negative.  RUQ ultrasound here with sludge,
but no gallstones or dilatation to suggest cholecystitis. [**7-5**]
AST 28, ALT 34, Alk Phos 161, Total Bili 0.4, Alb 3.8, Amylase
61 and Lipase 27. Pain control with tylenol, and oxycodone prn.
Pain was attributed to pleural irritation in the context of PNA.

* Long QT syndrome: Pacemaker interrogated by [**7-6**] for ?
undersensing. Pacer adjusted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9673**] from EP.

* Hyperglycemia: no history of Diabetes. Most likely stress
response in the setting of an infection. Insulin drip initially
in the ICU for tight glucose control, discontinued 7 pm [**7-6**].
Then RISS initiated, but subsequently discontinued as the pt's
BG normalized.

* Anemia: HCT above baseline on admission. Anemia due to MDS.
Needs monthly transfusions. last transfusion pn [**2116-6-25**]. Hct
trending down during admission. Baseline in last 2 years appears
to be around 22-24. Pt also symptomatic with Hct 21. Transfused
1 unit blood. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] emailed abt the transfusion. Weekly CBC
and f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

* MDS:
- Follow up report on differential (44% 'other')
- Followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. MICU team discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. No
indication for further chemotherapy at this time.

* Possible esophogeal mass: Distal esophageal diverticulum
versus ulcerated mass seen at the distal third of esophagus on
CT abdomen/pelvis at [**Hospital 6136**] Hospital. Will need need
outpatient f/u. ? EGD versus barium swallow.

* Lung mass: Concern for RLL mass on CXR. Especially
