Chief Complaint:
Unstable angina/periop Myocardial Infarction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2169-5-11**] Coronary artery bypass grafting x5, left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending coronary artery; reverse
saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the first diagonal
coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein graft from the aorta to

vein single graft from the aorta to the third obtuse marginal

History of Present Illness:
67 year old male with a complicated medical history including
coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease,
obstructive sleep apnea, and diabetes mellitus who presented to
an OSH after a fall and concern for syncope.  Pt was found to
have critical carotid stenosis on the right and underwent CEA
without complication. On pod#2 he had chest pain at rest that
lasted approximately 45 minutes. Troponins were mildly elevated.
BNP>1000. A repeat echo revealed slight changes in wall motion
and ejection fraction. Cardiac cath was performed and revealed
multivessel coronary artery disease. Mr.[**Known lastname **] was transferred
to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac evaluation and possible
revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2169-5-11**] Echo: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Moderate spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=40-45
%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal
free wall contractility. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in
the distal aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is
seen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**2-5**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB: The right heart chamber has decreased in size to a
normal range. The LV systolic function remains mildly depressed,
estimated EF = 45%. The mobile atheroma in the distal arch
remains unchanged. There is no evidence of aortic dissection.

[**5-11**] Vein mapping: Patent left and right greater saphenous veins
from the ankle to the saphenofemoral junctions with the
measurements as indicated above.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
surgical management. Upon admission he received medical
management and underwent surgical work-up. He also awaited
Plavix wash-out prior to surgery.  Aortic Insufficiency was
noted on echo and dental consult was obtained in the event that
the valve would be replaced.  The patient had dental extractions
on [**2169-5-8**].
On [**5-11**] he was brought to the operating room where he underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft x 5. Please see operative report
for surgical details.  He did develop profound hypotension
following Protamine, and this will be listed as an allergy for
the future.  Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU
for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
The patient remained intubated, on vasopressor support for
several days in the CVICU.  He did develop post-op atrial
fibrillation and was started on amiodarone and coumadin.  He was
maintained on an insulin drip in the immediate post-op period
for his diabetes.  Lasix drip was initiated for diuresis.  He
converted to sinus rhythm prior to discharge and was maintained
on PO amio and anti-coagulated on coumadin.  INR became
supra-therapeutic, and coumadin was held.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Vasopressors were finally weaned off and Beta blocker was
initiated.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor
for further recovery.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By
the time of discharge on POD 13 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with
Tylenol.  The patient was discharged to [**Location (un) 89825**]Nursing and Rehab in [**Location (un) 5450**], NH in good conditi
