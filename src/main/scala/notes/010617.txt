Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 38277**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
87F with h/o asthma, recently dx dCHF, HTN and HLD presenting
with worsening dyspnea and LE swelling. She reports that he
symptoms have been long standing (months-years), but worsening
recently. Last week, she went to the ED for back pain, but had
also noted that she was more SOB and her ankles were starting to
swell. She has had DOE for 'a long while' but generally does not
feel her ankles swell up.
On Friday night (1 day prior to admission), the patient reports
that she began feeling 'breathless'. She denies CP, diaphoresis,
palpitations, N/V. She felt that she couldn't catch her breath
and was evening having trouble speaking in full sentances. This
extent of dyspnea has not happened before. Her daughter came to
visit and reports that she was almost gasping for air and very
unsteady on her feet. She recently went to her PCP reporting her
milder symptoms (DOE, LE swelling) and was told to stop taking
her HCTZ and start on furosemide 10 mg daily (which she started
on Thursday or Friday). She also reports stable orthopnea, but
denies nocturnal cough or PND.
As per EMS reports, the patient was found to be 89% on RA,
improving to 100% on a NRB in the ambulance. Upon arrival to the
ED, her initial vitals were 97.2 56 132/65 20 100% 10L. Her exam
revealed basilar crackles and 2+ pitting edema to the mid-shins.
Her oxygen saturation dropped to 90% on RA. Labs were
significant for HCO3 38, BNP 2986, and Trop 0.02. Her CXR was
read as central pulmonary vascular engorgement. A bedside TTE by
the ED staff was reportedly negative for pericardial fluid. She
received furosemide 40 mg IV x1 with reported UOP of 150 cc. She
was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for further management of a CHF
exacerbation. Vitals prior to tranfer: 53 135/70 28 94% 2L NC.

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports feeling that her
breathing is much improved. She continues to feel minimally SOB
and her breathing appears minimally labored. She denies CP,
palpitations, N/V, abd pain, D/C, or HA. She denies significant
changes in her salt intake recently. She endorses a [**2-27**] lb
weight gain over the summer.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
