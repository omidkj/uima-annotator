.
At [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **], pt was afebrile (T 97.7) and continued to have SBPs
80-90's despite Levophed. Cefepime 2g IV x 1 was given and

[**3-7**] Admission cxr: There is extensive bibasilar consolidation
with air bronchograms.  Right suprahilar opacity is also
evident.  There is blunting of both costophrenic angles
suggestive of small effusions.  No pneumothorax is evident.
.
[**3-7**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
