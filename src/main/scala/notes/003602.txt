for 3 days as well as productive cough with yellowish phlegm x2
weeks.  Patient reports that for the past few [**Last Name (un) 32460**] he has felt
increasingly lethargic.  He has been taking frequent naps which
is unusual for him.  He also noted progressively worsening
mobility due to pain/stiffness in his joints.  He has chronic
right hip and knee pain.  This morning, he was unable to change
positions from sitting to standing.  He remained in bed due to
weakness.  He denies worsening swelling or erythema in his lower
extremities.  He did have some mild pain in his left leg and
knee.  He developed chills around 7:15 am and came to the ER for
evaluation.  In addition, he reports 2.5 weeks of cough
productive of grey/yellow sputum.  He denies any chest pain or
shortness of breath associated with cough.  He notes that it has
improved in the last several days.
.
Of note, patient went to the podiatrist Tuesday and had his toe
nails clipped.  Left second toe was accidentally cut.  He did
not really notice that his left leg was erythematous until he
got to the ED.  Says that his left leg is usually more swollen
anyway since his ankle injury.
.
In the ED, initial VS were as follows: 99.6 86 137/71 18 95% RA.

blood pressure.  Was given IV fluids with return to normal sinus
rhythm.  Tmax in ED was [**Age over 90 **]F. He was noted to have erythema of
right leg. He was also noted to be soaked in urine and with
stage 1 ulcer overlying swelling of right posterior hip. He was
also noted to have a dressing on his left 2th toe that had
adhered to nailbed from his podiatry appointment on Wednesday;
dressing was removed with gauze in ED. He was given a dose of
vancomycin to treat cellulitis.  His hip was considered for
septic joint, however exam showed that his hip joint was
rangeable.  His CXR was not very concerning for pneumonia, but
given that he was producing sputum and having fever, was given
levofloxacin.
.
Vitals in ED at time of bed request were as follows: 99.6 86
137/71 18 95%RA. About half hour after getting a dose of
oxycodone, his blood pressures were 87/50s while asleep, blood
pressure responded to IV fluids.  Patient intermittently would
continue to dip down into the 80s, each time responsive to IV
fluids.  Received a total of 3 L NS.  Lactate improved from 2.7
to 1.1.  VS in ED prior to transfer were as follows: 82, 96/41,
17, 96% RA
.
On arrival to the ICU,  vital signs were T103.0 BP 119/51 HR 90
saturating on RA.  He was talkative and had no complaints of
pain.
