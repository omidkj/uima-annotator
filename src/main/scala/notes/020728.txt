STUDIES:
-[**5-10**] ECG: Artifact is present. Atrial fibrillation with a
controlled ventricular response. Right bundle-branch block.
There are non-diagnostic Q waves in the lateral leads.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
the rate is faster.
  Intervals Axes
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T

-[**5-10**] CXR: Massive cardiomegaly, stable from prior exam. No
overt failure
or infiltrate identified.
-[**5-16**] PATHOLOGY PARATHYROID: Pending at time of discharge
-[**5-17**] Portable CXR: 1. moderate pericardial effusion.
2. Mild pulmonary edema.
3. Left lower lobe consolidation which might represent
atelectasis or
pneumonia.Post-operative aspiration pneumonia is possible and
folow-up chest x-ray with short interval is recommended.
- [**5-18**] TTE:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to
hypokinesis of the inferior septum and inferior free wall. The
right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
mild-to-moderatepulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2187-1-19**], the findings are similar.
[**5-18**] Renal ultrasound:
CONCLUSION: Normal renal ultrasound.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Weakness: This was Ms. [**Known lastname **] main complaint at time of
admission and throughout her hospital stay. This was
mutlifactorial, initially due to hypercalcemia, with components
related to deconditioning and then post-operative state as
discussed below. At time of discharge, she reported that her
weakness had improved. She worked with physical therapy and will
continue to do so on an outpatient basis. Throughout her stay,
she had no focal complaints or deficits. B12 was normal, and an
RPR non-reactive.
.
# Hyperparathyroidism: Patient's hypercalcemia was initially
treated medically. Given her symptoms and social concerns, she
remained monitored in the hospital and underwent
parathyroidectomy on [**2187-5-16**] (details in operative report).
Endocrinology followed during her stay, with careful monitoring
of calcium/phosphorous levels post-operatively.
She was discharged on 1500 mg of calcium carbonate TID, 0.25 mg
of calcitriol, and 800 units of vitamin D daily, as well as her
home dose of furosemide. She will follow up with endocrinology
within one week of discharge.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of a pulmonary
embolism in [**12/2183**] as well as atrial fibrillation for which she
was on warfarin. Her INR was initially supratherapeutic. Her
warfarin was held for surgery and resumed post-operatively. She
will follow up with the [**Hospital3 **] at discharge. Her
digoxin and carvediolol were continued, however several days
after
