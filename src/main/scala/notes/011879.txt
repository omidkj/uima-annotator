Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**6-22**] cardiac catheterization s/p BMS to Left Anterior Descending
artery


History of Present Illness:
86 year old female who called EMS on [**2168-6-14**] for acute onset of
dyspnea. She was in her usual state of health until dinner when
she was too nauseous to eat and then became acutely short of
breath. Upon reflection she has had increasing fatigue in the
past few days as well as some slight increases in SOB. She
reports strict adherance to medications and diet restrictions
(no salt, no sugar, limits fluid intake). While being
transported she was placed on BiPAP and BP was noted to be
180/120. In the ED she taken off BiPAP and weaned down to 4L.
She continued to be dyspneic although her blood pressure did
improve slightly.
.
Of note she was recently admitted for weakness and malaise and
found to be hyperkalemic to 7.8 with ECG changes and a Cr of
3.7. This was thought to be related to either lisinopril or
Bactrim. Her cr then returned to baseline and her K has been
stable aroung 5.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 87, 157/45, 26, 94% RA
.
On the floor, she was increasingly short of breath and
tachypeniac. She was very anxious about her breathing. She notes
a 5 lbs weight gain over the past 5 days.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI , also with cough, occasional constipation.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, Denies headache, sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied chest pain or
tightness, palpitations. Denied vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal
pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial
infarction in [**2157**], which was treated with balloon angioplasty
of the RCA. This was complicated by an RCA dissection.
2. Recent cardiac catheterization in [**1-19**] secondary to
resting angina associated with positive troponin and anterior
lateral ST depression. Study noted a heavily calcified LAD with
diffuse disease throughout as well as a left circ with diffusely
diseased small OM1 and small OM2 with 50% stenosis at the origin
as well as diffuse disease through the AV groove into OM3 side
branch with 70% stenosis in the lower pole, all of which was
unfavorable to PCI.
3. Combined diastolic and systolic heart failure. Most recent
EF: 40% per cards note.
4. Peripheral arterial disease with a left superior femoral
artery angioplasty complicated by dissection requiring stent in
[**6-18**] as well as left common iliac and external iliac artery
stenting in [**Month (only) 547**] of 06.
5. Hypertension
6. Dyslipidemia
7. Diabetes
8. Baseline chronic kidney disease with a recent episode of
acute renal failure secondary to treatment with an ACE inhibitor
for which she was hospitalized in early [**Month (only) 547**].

Social History:
The patient currently lives in [**Location 745**] with her [**Age over 90 **] year old
husband. She has 1 son who lives in [**Name (NI) 701**]. At baseline she

No hydronephrosis and no renal stone or mass identified.
There is a discrepancy in the peak systolic velocities of the
main renal
artery bilaterally. The right main renal artery measures 85
cm/sec and the
left main renal artery measures about 50 cm/sec. Additionally,
minimal
diastolic to no diastolic flow is seen in the waveforms
bilaterally. These
findings are of uncertain clinical significance but a renal
artery stenosis
cannot be excluded. An MRA could be performed if clinically
indicated.


[**6-22**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:

Initial angiography revealed a heavily calcified 80% proximal
LAD
stenosis. We planned to perform PTCA and stenting. Heparin was
started
prophylactically. A 6 French XB LAD 3.5cm guiding catheter
provided good
support for the procedure. A Prowater wire crossed the stenosis
with
minimal difficulty however it was unable to be positioned
distally in
the LAD so it was advanced in a diagonal branch. The stenosis
was
dilated with a 2.5 x 8mm Quantum Maverick balloon at 12 ATM. A
2.5 x
12mm Mini Vision stent was deployed in the proximal LAD at 16
ATM. The
stent was postdilated with a 2.75 x 8mm Quantum Maverick balloon
at 14
ATM. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
angiographically apparent


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 86 year old lady with known CAD, CHF (EF
~40%), PAD, HTN, DM who presented with acute onset of shortness
of breath.

1. SOB/CHF Excerbation: Patient's presentation consistent with
worsening of chronic CHF. Her BNP is elevated. She has history
of weight gain. Her CXR is consistent with volume overload.
Unclear what has made her worse in the past few days. On arrival
to the floor, the patient was initially stable, but then became
more dyspneic. She was given another 80mg of IV lasix, low-dose
Morphine and seemed to stabilize, having put out 1.6 liters.
Her oxygen sats improved, but later she was found to be
unresponsive.  Repeat ABG showed a stable CO2, and she was
transferred to the CCU for further management. In the CCU, she
was placed on a lasix gtt for diuresis and nitro gtt for BP
control.  Repeat chest x-ray showed continued pulmonary edema
and LLL atelectasis vs. pneumonia. In the abscence of fever or
leukocytosis, antibiotics were not continued in the CCU.  Urine
output was not optimal on lasix gtt and diuresis was changed to
Lasix IV bolus and metolazone [**Hospital1 **].  Patient diuresed well with
improvement in her shortness of breath and oxygenation.  Repeat
echo showed stable EF 35-40% with hypokinesis of the inferior
wall, septal and apical segments (multivessel CAD). During her
acute CHF exacerbation, she had wheezing on exam that were
treated with nebulizer treatments and cough that was managed
symptommatically with anti-tussives.  Post-catheterization she
continued on her home dose of lasix 40mg daily and appeared
euvolemic to somewhat dry clinically. Thus her lasix dosage was
reduced to 20mg daily. She does not tolerate ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] because of
hyperkalemia so she was restarted on her home [**Last Name (un) 4319**] of
Hydralazine/Isordil.

documented diffuse disease from previous catheterization in
