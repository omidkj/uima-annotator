Endotracheal Intubation

History of Present Illness:
66 yo man with PMH HTN and recent admission for pna in [**Month (only) **]
who presents to ED after syncopal episode. Pt intubated and
sedated w/o family memeber in ICU so HPI by report and records
which is missing ED resident note. Pt presented after syncopal
episode with 5-6 minute of LOC with head trauma after he got up
from dinner to get to the bathroom. No other Sx compliant but
noted to be diaphoretic; no CP or SOB. ON arrival pale and
diaphoretic. HDS during EMS travel but tachycaric with tarnsient
RBBB. ECG w/ ? STE. Given ASA/BB/NTG and started on hep gtt. Pt
became more pale, diaphoretic and less responsive. Pt intubated
for airway protection as MS changed and Pt became hypotensive.
Post intubateion SBP 50's -> levophed. CVL placed. Bedside echo
obtained which showed evidence of right sided ventricular
dilation and hypokinesis. CTA demonstrated massive b/l PE While
in ED, became hypotensive with respiratory distress. Intubated.
Bedside echo showed evidence of right sided dilation and hypok.
CTA demonstrated massive b/l PE -> heparin restarted and then
administered TPA (15 mg IVP, 42mg/hr). Unable to place foley
prior to TPA. Pt transfered to MICU.

Significant Diagnostic Imaging Studies
.
[**2115-11-5**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated. Right ventricular systolic function
appears depressed. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2115-11-5**] CXR:
PORTABLE CHEST:  Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable.
 Pulmonary vasculature appears within normal limits.  Small
nodular densities are seen over the right mid lung.  No evidence
of focal consolidation or pleural effusions.  Likely bibasilar
atelectasis is seen.
.
[**2115-11-5**] CTA Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Massive burden of pulmonary embolism bilaterally extending
from the mid to distal right and left main pulmonary arteries
outward into nearly all branches of the pulmonary arterial
vasculature.
2.  Multiple pleural-based calcified plaques consistent with
prior asbestos exposure.
.
[**2115-11-5**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.  No
fractures.
2.  Soft tissue lesion on vertex of scalp.  Please correlate
with physical examination to confirm sebaceous cyst versus
neoplasm.
.
[**11-6**] U/S Bil LE:
Nonocclusive thrombus identified within the right popliteal
vein.
.
[**11-8**] CXR:
Mild edema has developed in the lower lungs.  Upper lungs are
clear, with
persistent vascular congestion on the left and diminished
vascularity
peripherally.
.
[**11-8**] f/u CXR:
Worsening patchy areas of opacity in both lower lobes.  This
could be due to aspiration, hemorrhage, or pneumonia.
.
[**11-9**] CXR:
Slight interval improvement in bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
.
[**11-10**] CXR:
Persistent bibasilar pulmonary infiltrates.  No significant
internal change.
.
[**11-11**] CXR:
Lung volumes are low, and mild cardiomegaly with mediastinal
vascular
engorgement are stable.  Atelectasis at the left lung base is
more pronounced. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
Lateral aspect of the left lower chest is excluded from the
examination.  Pleural effusion, if any, is on the left and
small; the other pleural surfaces are unremarkable.  No
pneumothorax.
.
[**11-12**] CXR:
Left lower lobe collapse has worsened, accompanied by increasing
small left pleural effusion.  Major interval change has been
significant increase in caliber of mediastinal vessels
suggesting marked elevation in central venous pressure, which
could be a reflection of either volume overload, cardiac
decompensation or right heart failure due to increase in
pulmonary vascular resistance from worsening pulmonary embolism.
 Left subclavian line tip projects over the left brachiocephalic
vein.  No pneumothorax.
.
[**11-13**] CXR:
Lung volumes are lower, mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has
developed.
Severe mediastinal widening suggests persistence of marked
increase in central venous pressure, exaggerated by lower lung
volumes.  Tip of the left subclavian line projects over the left
brachiocephalic vein.  Small left pleural effusion has
increased.  No pneumothorax.
.
[**11-13**] f/u CXR:
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2115-11-13**].  The
enlarged heart size is unchanged as well.  There is increased
width of the mediastinum, most likely was known to be due to fat
deposition.  The bilateral pleural effusions and left lung
consolidation are again noted.  Noted, right more than left.
The ET tube tip is 7.8 cm above the carina.  The left subclavian
line tip is in the mid portion of the left brachiocephalic vein.

.
[**11-13**] Echo:
Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2115-11-5**], the right  venticular cavity is smaller and free
wall motion is normal. Pulmonary artery  systolic hypertension
is now identified.
.
[**11-14**] CT-PA:
1.  Reduction in bulk of bilateral pulmonary embolus. The
largest amount
centrally is seen about the right upper lobe pulmonary artery
origin with
minimal opacification of right upper lobe pulmonary arteries. No
infarcts.
2.  Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis/consolidations.
.
[**11-14**] CT Head w/o Contrast:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Increasing sinus
opacification, likely related to intubation.
.
[**11-14**] CXR:
The ET tube tip is too high, 6.7 cm above the carina.  The
mediastinal width has been decreased with the decrease of
pulmonary edema.  The left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
.
[**11-15**] U/S RUQ:
1.  Extremely limited study.  No gallstones or biliary
dilatation.
2.  Right-sided pleural effusion.
.
[**11-18**] U/S Bil LE:
Persistent nonocclusive thrombus identified within the right
popliteal vein.  No evidence of DVT within the left lower
extremity.
.
[**11-20**] CT Head w/ Sinus Views
Study significantly degraded by patient motion artifact,
demonstrating
resolution of the hyperdense air/fluid level in the right
maxillary sinus, partial clearing of the left sphenoid sinus air
cell, and relatively stable, virtually complete opacification of
the right sphenoid sinus.  ENT consultation suggested, and
particularly if drainage is contemplated, a repeat study is
advised.
.
[**11-22**] CXR:
Stable left lower lobe atelectasis versus
