Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 78-year-old woman with a
history of multiple psychiatric admissions for bipolar
disorder as well as hypertension, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, diverticulosis, Barrett's esophagus who
was recently on ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection
for the past three days and was found on the floor by her
husband covered in brown feces and vomit.  She was noted to
then be vomiting dark brown material.  She reported abdominal
pain that was right-sided, crampy and nonradiating on the
night prior to admission also associated with vomiting and
diarrhea.  She also noted fatigue.  The husband called 911
and the patient was seen by Emergency Medical Services at the
scene with vital signs:  Heart rate 98, blood pressure
138/palp, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 96% on four
liters nasal cannula.

On arrival to the Emergency Department, her vital signs were
150/82, 92, 18, 100% on room air with a temperature of 96.2.
She vomited a small amount of coffee ground material times
two.  An NG tube was placed to suction and the patient
subsequently had bright red blood per rectum.  Two peripheral
IV's were placed.  Labs were notable for a WBC count of 26.5,
hematocrit of 47 and a BUN/creatinine of 35/1.4.  She
received two liters of normal saline, levofloxacin and Flagyl
as well.  CT of the abdomen was performed which demonstrated
diffuse colonic thickening.

Surgery was consulted who considered ischemic versus
infectious colitis.

scleral icterus.  Mucus membranes moist.  No lesion.  Neck
supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No bruits.  Jugular venous

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Colitis:  While in the MICU, the patient had spiked a
fever to 101.2 and had significant bandemia.  She had an
anion gap of 15 with a lactate of 4.1.  She continued to note
abdominal pain with diarrhea initially.  Was being treated
with vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl and received
aggressive intravenous fluid hydration.  Clostridium
difficile and stool cultures were sent and were all negative.
It was unclear whether or not the patient had infectious
colitis versus ischemic colitis with super infection from
transmutation of flora.  Gastroenterology was consulted who
could not provide a definitive diagnosis either.  Due to the
patient's cardiac issues the patient was not sent for scope.
Over the course of several days, the patient's fever went
down and her white count decreased.  She was taken off the
vancomycin and maintained on levofloxacin and Flagyl.  She
will continue a 14 day course of these medications.  She
should have an outpatient colonoscopy performed by
Gastroenterology.

No source of upper GI bleeding was noted.  It is possible
that this could have been from her lower GI sources.
Outpatient workup is indicated.  She was tolerating a regular
diet at the time of discharge.

2.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient's blood pressure
medications were held on admission due to concern over
gastrointestinal bleeding.  On the day after admission the
patient was noted to be atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response.  She was given Lopressor IV push that
resulted in a six second pause.  Given the patient's reported
history to beta blockers and calcium channel blockers,
Electrophysiology was consulted, especially with the concern
of AV nodal disease.  The patient was started on a verapamil
drip.  She was then changed to p.o. verapamil 80 mg p.o.
t.i.d.  The patient fluctuated between atrial fibrillation
and normal sinus rhythm with a well controlled rate.  The
verapamil was discontinued on hospital day three.  The
patient was transferred to the floor for additional workup of
her GI issues.  On the night she was sent to the floor the
patient again had atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response with a heart rate in the 150's to 170's
with a blood pressure in the 70's systolic.  She was brought
back to the MICU and placed on a verapamil drip with good
control of her blood pressure.  She was then changed to
verapamil 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. with good control of her
ventricular response.  She went back and forth between atrial
fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm.  Decision was made not
to anticoagulate given her gastrointestinal issues and recent
GI bleed.

Electrophysiology continued to consult and directed that if
her rate was not well controlled with the p.o. verapamil that
additional nodal blockade with amiodarone or other agents may
be necessary and might require a pacemaker.  They were not
willing to do this procedure at this time due to her stable
condition and GI issues.

3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  This patient was
maintained on her albuterol, Atrovent and Flovent inhalers.
She did not experience any COPD exacerbations.  She was
maintained on her home oxygen requirement and was discharged
on one liter of home oxygen.

4.  Hypertension:  The patient has likely poorly controlled
hypertension as an outpatient.  She had her antihypertensives
held and then restarted.  The patient was on Cozaar as an
outpatient and was placed on captopril
