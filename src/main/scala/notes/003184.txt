bronchoscopy with stenting to L main bronchus

History of Present Illness:
40 year old female with recent dx of metastatic esophageal
cancer with R main bronchus stent and esophageal stent,
transferred from OSH ED with resp failure since home O2 ran out
this AM.  Husband states that pt respiratory distress occured
acutely and did not improve with new O2 tanks.  He states that
she did not complain of any chest pain but he states that she
did have fevers and cough earlier that day. Intitially at OSH
patient was T 103, BP 99/35, HR 130s-170s (sinus)95% NRB. Pt was
intubated and given imimpenem, solumedrol.  Her ABG at OSH was
7.25/75/75 before intubation.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care. In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] patient afebrile [**Company 5249**] 99 rectal and CXR
showed stable RML/RLL collapse.

Past Medical History:
esophogeal cancer (poorly diff adenocarcinoma of distal
esophogas), s/p esophageal stent with mets to adrenal, pancreas
and T12 vertebrae
anxiety disorder,
HTN,
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
?Non small cell lung cancer with 80% stenosis of R main
bronchus, s/p stent.

.
Chest CT [**5-8**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) No pulmonary embolism.
2) Extensive tumor involving the mid and distal esophagus
invading into the right hilum and intimately associated with the
left atrium. This tumor narrows and encases the right-sided
pulmonary arteries and occludes the right middle and right lower
lobe bronchi.
3) Interval placement of an esophageal stent as well as an
apparent right- sided bronchial stent which is now located
within the fistulous tract connecting the residual esophageal
lumen and the right lower lobe bronchi. It is possible that this
stent has migrated from its intended location in the bronchus
intermedius.
4) Persisting total collapse of the right middle lobe and right
lower lobe.
5) Persisting fluid-filled cavitary lesion in the right middle
lobe, which may be superinfected.
6) Persisting ground glass and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the
right upper and left lower lobes, likely infectious.
7) Lytic lesion in the T12 vertebral body, likely metastasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 40 y/o F with PMHx significant for metastatic esophageal
CA, ? NSCLC s/p R bronchus and esophageal stents who presents
from OSH with fever and respiratory distress.
.
1. Respiratory Distress:
The intial suspicion was that the patient had developed a
pneumonia which led to a decompensation on the backgroudn of her
poor baseline with R lung atelectasis from her tumor. She was
treated empirically with Zosyn and vanco given recent
hospitalization. However, a bronch was performed to evaluate her
airways and the stent placement. This unfortunately showed very
severe anatomical defects caused by the urdelying cancer. There
was obstruction noted of both L and R mainstem bronchus. The
esophageal stent was noted to be eroding through the esophageal
wall into the R mainstem bronchus. The patient returned for
another bronch by interventional pulmonary with a plan to make
an aggressive attempt to treat the lesions as best as possible.
However, removal of the esophageal stent which was eroding into
the R bronchus was not possible. The L mainstem bronchus was
stented. Discussions were held with the family and with the
patient who remained awake, alert and fully aware of her
surroundings and able to communicate (non-verbally given that
she was intubated). It was explained to the patient and the
family that she would never be able to be safely extubated given
the severity of the disease and that her prognosis from the
aggressive cancer was one of terminal progression likely over
weeks to a few months. The patient ultimately elected for
comfort measures only. She was extubated on [**2198-5-10**] in the
company of her family. She soon passed away quietly and
comfortably with her friends and family present
