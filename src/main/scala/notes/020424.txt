Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo female with PXE, PVD s/p L and R SFA stent who underwent
revascularization by atherectomy and local tpa and replacement
of right stent on [**6-16**].  Post-op she was noticed to have a
decrease in her hematocrit from 32 to 25.  She also went into
A-fib with rapid ventricular respose at which point she was rate
controlled with Atenolol. A repeat hematocrit was 28.  She then
had en episode of BRBPR and melena.  Her vitals were stable.
She was transered to the CCU.  She was transfused one unit of
blood overnight and her hematocrit increased to 34.  She
continued to have some blood mixed in with her stool.  GI was
consulted and she went for a colonoscopy the next day ([**2160-6-18**])
which showed no active bleeding but there was a friable lesion
that was biopsed.  Biopsy results were pending at time of
discharge.  She remained stable and was transfered to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 for
observation.  Patient remained in A-fib.  Her hematocrit
decreased to 29.4, but she remained asymptomatic.  She was
discharged from the hospital on Ausust 1.  She will have her INR
and her hematocrit checked on [**6-22**].  She has follow up
appointments with her cardiologist, PCP and [**Name Initial (PRE) **] general sugeon for
possible rescection of bowel lesion.

Problems:
.
# CAD/Ischemia: Pt without Hx of CAD, but does have PVD s/p left
SFA stent in [**1-/2159**] and right atherectomy with right SFA stent
on [**2159-3-15**] and stent, thrombectomy and tpa on [**2160-6-16**] of R SFA.
- Primary prevention for CAD includes ASA, BB, ACEi.
- Plavix and ASA for stent placement.
.
# Heart Failure: Pt with Hx of diastolic heart failure. No
record of Echo. Pt with crackles on exam and B/L LE edema.
- Continue lasix
.
# Rhythm: Pt with Hx of a-fib and has been having episodes Rapid
A-fib.  She is rate controlled with atenolol.
- Continue atenolol for rate control.
- Coumadin stopped for revascularization.  Coumadin was
restarted after her colonoscopy.
.
# HTN: Hx of Hypertension. Patient was not hypertensive durring
her hospital stay.  She remained on her blood pressure
medication.
- C/w BP meds.
.
# GI BLEED: Pt. with BRBPR and melena after procedure. Pt. has
been on coumadin, ASA and plavix for long time. There was a
concern that some of the tpa that became systemic durring her
procedure had caused her GI bleed, however a friable lesion was
found on biopsy that was the most likely cause of the bleeding.
Her hematocrit initially dropped from 32 to 28 and increased to
34 with one unit of blood.  On discharge her hematocrit was
29.4. She remained without symptoms, and her vitals were stable.
 No further signs of bleeding. Colonoscopy done showing a
friable lesion in the ascending colon.
- Biopsies pending on discharge
- Continue with protonix
- Follow up with GI as out pt
.
