IMAGING:
[**2101-4-18**] ECHO Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
regional and mild global hypokinesis. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Compared with the report of the prior
study (images unavailable for review) of [**2096-12-13**], the severity
of aortic regurgitation has increased.
.
[**2101-4-18**] CT NECK W/CONTRAST : 1. No evidence of neck masses or
pathologic lymphadenopathy. Per discussion with the primary
team, palpable area of abnormality is consistent with a small
lymph node. 2. Severe atherosclerotic disease. 3. Significant
emphysema and calcified pleural plaques, better evaluated on
subsequent CT torso.
