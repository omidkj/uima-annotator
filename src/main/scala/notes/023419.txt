B/L LENIS
INDICATION: A 76-year-old female with hypoxic respiratory
failure and
hemoptysis, history of lower extremity DVT, evaluate for
interval clot
formation.

COMPARISON: Bilateral leg ultrasound [**2127-7-27**].

FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of
bilateral
common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and tibial veins.


Occlusive thrombus is again seen within the posterior tibial
veins of the left
calf. These veins do not compress and do not show vascular flow.
Note is
made that the left peroneal veins could not be identified.

Normal flow, compression, and augmentation is seen in the
remainder of the
deep veins of the left leg and all of the veins of the right
leg.

IMPRESSION: Persistent clot in the left posterior tibial veins.
No
progression of the clot is identified and the remainder of the
deep vessels
bilaterally demonstrate no DVT.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CT head
INDICATION: Question stroke with right facial droop; assess for
intracranial
hemorrhage.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
brain.

COMPARISONS: None available.

FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or
major vascular territorial infarction. THE [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation
is preserved. Mild ventricular and sulcal prominence is
compatible with
age-related atrophy. There is no shift of normally midline
structures. There
is extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the carotid
siphons.

There is no fracture. The imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells
demonstrate right-sided maxillary, sphenoid, and ethmoid air
cell mucosal
thickening.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process; note that MR is more sensitive
than CT for
assessing for acute ischemic infarction.
2. Bifrontal cortical atrophy and mild sequelae of chronic small
vessel
ischemic disease, as on the MR examination of [**2120-2-7**].

COMMENT: This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at 2:25
a.m. on
[**2127-7-30**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

TTE [**7-29**]
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD or PFO by 2D, color
Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Small LV cavity.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 1 iv
injection of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline at rest. Suboptimal
image quality as the patient was difficult to position.
Suboptimal image quality - ventilator.
Conclusions
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. The left
ventricular cavity is small. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated
