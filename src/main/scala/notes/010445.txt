percent in room air, weight 62.82 kilograms.  In general, the
patient is ill appearing and coughing.  He is alert and
oriented.  Skin - Face is flushed, and the patient has good
capillary refill.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat is

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent laboratory data showed sodium
134, potassium 3.4, chloride 92, bicarbonate 29, blood urea
nitrogen 36, creatinine 3.5, glucose 67.  White blood cell
count 2.9, hematocrit 28.8, glucose 609. Urine culture
demonstrates gram positive bacteria.  Rapamycin level from
[**2169-11-19**], is 3.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Transplant
Surgery service on [**2169-11-27**].  On the first night of his
admission, he became hypoxic and required four to ten liters
of oxygen to keep his oxygen saturation in the 90s.  He was
tachycardic to the 120s.  He was ill appearing and in mild
distress.  It was therefore decided to transfer him to the
Intensive Care Unit for close observation.  An arterial blood
gas done at this time demonstrated the pH 7.5, pCO2 38, paO2
64.  The patient's oxygen saturation increased to 96 percent
on ten liters of humidified oxygen delivered via face tent.
The patient also received Albuterol Ipratropium nebulizers
which seemed to improve his breathing.  The patient was
started on Vancomycin, Linezolid and Levofloxacin for general
coverage.  His condition was consistent with pneumonia and
sinusitis.  An ENT consultation was called and they agreed
with this diagnosis and recommended normal saline sprays to
the nose three times a day to help clear out his sinuses.
Infectious disease consultation was obtained and they helped
manage his treatment and recommended various studies while he
was in the hospital.  His head CT was positive for sinusitis,
and a chest CT was consistent with pneumonia.  His blood
cultures were all negative.  His viral cultures were
negative. His Legionella urinary antigen cultures were
negative.  His antibiotics were changed to Unasyn for
sinusitis and Azithromycin for atypical pneumonia and he was
treated with Fluconazole for yeast which was found on his
sputum culture.  He continued to improve in the Intensive
Care Unit throughout his stay and his oxygen was able to be
titrated down.  With hydration, his creatinine slowly
improved and decreased from 3.5 on admission to 2.3 at the
time of discharge.  While in the Intensive Care Unit, the
patient's hematocrit dropped to 23.0 and he required two
units of blood for blood loss anemia.  On [**2169-12-2**], the
patient was stable enough to be transferred to the floor.  He
had clinically improved in terms of his pneumonia and his
sinusitis.  On [**2169-12-3**], a decision was made to discharge
the patient to home.  The patient has hypertension at
baseline and experienced hypertension while in the hospital.
The renal attending recommended changing his Toprol to
Labetalol for better control since it is an alpha and beta
blocker.  The infectious disease team recommended sending him
home on four weeks of Augmentin for sinusitis, and ten days
of Azithromycin for atypical pneumonia.
