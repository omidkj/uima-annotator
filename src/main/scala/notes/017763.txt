IMAGING:
========
CT Head [**6-16**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or
mass effect.
.
ECHO [**2164-6-18**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is high normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
.
Left lower extremity ultrasound [**2164-6-18**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
.
CT CHEST [**2164-7-12**]:
Right PICC line tip is in the proximal right atrium. Aorta is
normal in
diameter. Main pulmonary artery is not enlarged, but right main
pulmonary rtery is 3 cm in diameter, might be reflecting
pulmonary hypertension.
Coronary calcifications are extensive. There is minimal amount
of pericardial effusion, grossly unchanged since the prior
study. Small but new bilateral pleural effusion is noted. Within
the axilla, there are multiple minimally enlarged lymph nodes.
There are no bone lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm.
Airways are patent till the level of subsegmental bronchi
bilaterally. Right upper lobe consolidation seen on the prior CT
and radiographs has significantly progressed since the prior
study, currently involving the apical posterior aspect of the
right upper lobe as well as superior aspect of right lower lobe.
There is lucency within the lateral aspect of the consolidation
in the right upper lobe, most likely representing still aerated
lung and unlikely to represent cavitation although should be
closely monitored. The left lung is clear except for basal
opacities that in part might represent atelectasis and unlikely
to represent infectious process.  The progression of the
consolidation has been also demonstrated on the chest radiograph
when compared to [**2164-7-8**], thus further followup of the
abnormality can be obtained with chest radiographs.  The
differential diagnosis would include rapidly progressing
bacterial pneumonia. The other options would be invasive
aspergillosis (less likely) as well as massive aspiration
(unlikely).
.
TTE [**2164-7-13**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). D
