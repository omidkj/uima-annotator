[**2161-6-20**] CXR:
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient after removal
of chest
tube.

PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in
comparison to [**2161-6-20**] study obtained at 09:34 a.m.

Current study demonstrates interval development of minimal
apical
pneumothorax. The left lung opacity is unchanged as well as
right basal
atelectasis. Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of
cavoatrial junction. Small pleural effusion cannot be excluded,
in particular on the left.

CXR [**2161-6-22**]: Improved left effusion, no appreciable PTX

Echo [**2161-6-19**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 61723**] was taken to the operating room on [**2161-6-18**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for VATS left upper lobectomy and left port-a-cath
placement and by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] for resection of left thigh mass.
She recovered in PACU and transfered to SICU overnight for
respiratory monitoring and Bipap. On POD 1 she transferred to
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9. Below is a systems review of her hospital course:

Pulmonary: Aggressive pulmonary toilet with nebulizers and chest
PT were initiated early on. A left Chest tube was discontinued
POD 2, with stable postpull film, with improved left effusion.
The patient saturated on room air 94% ambulating on day of
discharge.

CV: The patient initially was hypertensive and tachycardic-
eventually controlled with addition of metoprolol- which was
added to her discharge regime. She remained in SR 70-80's on
discharge. Her home antihypertensives were continued. She was
diuresed with lasix POD 1. Echo was done revealing normal heart
function.

Nutrition/GI: Her diet was advanced and tolerated.

GU: Her foley was discontinued POD 1, and she voided.
Electrolytes were watched and repleted.

Endo: She had blood glucose monitoring throughout with blood
sugars which remained 150-350, despite augmenting her regime.
She will followup with [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient next week.

Neurologic: The patient was given dilaudid IV postop then
successfully transitioned to po oxycodone and torodol for pain,
which was effective by date of discharge. She was slow to wake
up, but progressed over the first 24 hours in her stay. She was
seen by social work for depression and expressed SI, with a plan
but stated that she was not currently suicidal and if she
progressed in such thinking (per social work) she would talk
with her husband, psych and call 911.

PT: The patient was ambulating independently when PT came to
evaluate her, therefore they signed of.

Dispo: She was deemed stable and safe for home dc with husband
on [**2161-6-22**]. She will followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 30343**] and [**Last Name (un) **] early [**Month (only) **]. She will followup with
oncology for chemotherapy once surgically cleared. She will
followup with her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 16337**]. VNA will follow her.
