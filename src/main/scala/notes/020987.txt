[**4-6**] AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS AND FOUR VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FEMUR:
There is a comminuted intratrochanteric fracture of the right
femur with a separate lesser trochanteric fragment which is
roughly 1.1 cm medially displaced vis-?-vis the remainder of the
bone. The right femoral head articulates normally with the
acetabulum. No other fractures are identified. Extensive
vascular calcifications are noted, and there is a stent in the
distal aorta extending into the common iliac arteries. There is
a nonspecific nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.
IMPRESSION: Comminuted intratrochanteric fracture of the right
femur.
.
[**4-6**] CXR: 1. Right hilar asymmetry which is not completely
evaluated on this film. Comparison with old radiographs would be
useful. Alternatively, this can be evaluated with CT chest with
IV contrast.
2. Asbestos related pleural disease.
.
[**4-6**] Head CT
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture. Sinusitis.
.
[**4-6**] ABD/PELVIS CT
IMPRESSION: Mild decrease in size in the infrarenal abdominal
aortic sac aneurysm.
Cystic mass in the pancreatic [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] represent a cystadenoma
or cystadenocarcinoma. Further evaluation could be performed by
MRCP.
Diverticulosis.
Hiatal hernia.
Soft tissue mass within the bladder.
Findings were discussed with the staff member caring of the
patient.
Right femoral fracture.
.
BLADDER US
FINDINGS: Bladder is moderately distended, with a 4.7 x 2.9 x
2.1 cm heterogeneously hypoechoic lesion, arising from the lower
trigone of the bladder. That does not demonstrate vascular flow
on the color Doppler images. Patient is unable to void at the
time of the scan.
IMPRESSION: Possible 4.7 cm lesion arising from lower trigone of
the urinary bladder; does not demonstrate vascular flow on the
color Doppler images, differential diagnosis includes solid mass
versus hematoma. Kidney and bladder MR is recommended for
further evaluation.
.
URINE CYTOLOGY: ATYPICAL. Atypical urothelial cells present
singly and in clusters. Histiocytes, numerous neutrophils,
lymphocytes, crystals and red blood cells.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 85 M with COPD, AAA s/p endovascular repair,
initially admitted s/p unwitnessed fall at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with a R
hip fracture.  The following issues were addressed during his
hospitalization.

# Hip Fracture: He was found to have a right intertrochanteric
with lesser trochanter fracture and was taken to the operating
room for repair on [**2195-4-9**].  PT was consulted. He was started
on Calcium and Vitamin D.
.
# Hematuria: The patient developed gross hematuria from a
bladder mass (clot vs soft tissue mass seen on CT and US;
Cytology consistent with atypical urothelial cells)
necessitating transfusion of 3U pRBCs and continuous bladder
irrigation.   [**Year (4 digits) 159**] was consulted.  He was discharged on CBI
and will follow up with [**Year (4 digits) **] as an outpatient for cystoscopy.
 His SC Heparin was held (DVT prophylaxis) given ongoing
hematuria. Lupron will be continued.
.
# UTI: The patient was treated for a UTI with a 7 day course of
ciprofloxacin.
.
# Hemetemesis/Hypotension: The patient developed abdominal pain
and worsening abdominal distention on [**4-14**]; he then had an
episode of coffee ground emesis for which a nasogastric tube was
placed.  He was noted to be hypotensive with BP 70s/P.
Transferred to MICU for further management. 2 units of PRBC's
were transfused. NG tube was placed and he was started on [**Hospital1 **]
PPI IV. GI was consulted and an EGD was performed, which showed
severe esophagitis with friability and bleeding in the lower
third of the esophagus as well as a few erosions c/w NG tube
trauma in the stomach body. Vascular surgery was also consulted
given concern for AAA leak; a CT scan showed no evidence of
leak. His hypotension respo
