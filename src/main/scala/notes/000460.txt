History of Present Illness:
HPI: 76 yo woman with known h/o HTN, hypercholesterolemia, PVD,
B12 deficiency and recent diagnosis of positive anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibody
with cranial neuropathy and respiratory failure secondary to
paraneoplastic disorder related to a neuroendocrine tumor.
Patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for progressive
respiratory failure from progressive diaphragmatic weakness, and
returns from rehab 9 days after discharge with a new multifocal
pneumonia. Patient is sent here for further work-up of her PNA
and possible bronchoscopy.

Per daughter, patient was noted to have increased respiratory
effort over the last week and on CXR was found to have a
white-out of the left lung, thought to be secondary to pna.  She
also was with low grade temps to 100 and O2 desaturations
requiring ventilator adjustments and increased FiO2. Patient is
scheduled for chemo early next week at [**Hospital3 **] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**].

She is hard of hearing, but otherwise oriented and at baseline,
denies any pain or other complaints. Per daughter patient is
more comfortable today than yesterday. She also notes that she
has had increased secretions over last few days. ED nurse [**First Name (Titles) 8706**] [**Last Name (Titles) 58716**]a since admission as well, although was constipated last
week and started on bowel meds. She was started on Ceftaz on
[**3-14**] and then on amikacin on [**3-15**] for presumed double coverage
for pseudomonas. Of note on arrival from rehab she came on SIMV
450/18/7.5/80%

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 76 yo woman transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital **] rehab after
developing new multifocal pneumonia, leukocytosis and low grade
temps.
.
# Respiratory Failure: secondary to multifocal pneuomia, on top
of her underlying diaphragmatic weakness caused by the
paraneoplastic syndrome.  While in the hospital she was
maintained on a ventillator via her tracheostomy.  A
bronchoscopy was performed and showed normal airways.  Her
sputum grew out serratia and pseudomonas and she was treated
with zosyn.  The patient was initially also treated with
gentamycin for double pseudomonas coverage but her culture
showed gentamycin resistance.
.
# Leukocytosis: in addition to the pneumonia as a source of
infection, the patient had one blood culture positive for
klebsiella on [**2144-3-18**].  The klebsiella was also sensitive to
zosyn.  Her blood cultures from [**2144-3-19**] were negative.  The plan
for antibiotics was to continue zosyn for a total of 2 weeks.  A
PICC line was placed by IR on [**2144-3-23**].
.
# Paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to neuroendocrine tumor:
Discussed plan with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] who agreed that chemo therapy should
be held until after the patient completes her course of
treatment.
*
# HTN: The patient's ACEI was initially held given the
questionable history of bilateral renal artery stenosis, labile
BPs which were thought to be secondary to her autonomic
dysfunction from paraneoplastic source, and concern for
infection/sepsis.  Her ACEI was restarted while in hospital and
she maintained normal blood pressures.
.
# DVT in [**2143-11-25**]: The patient was continued on her home dose of
coumadin.  Her INR rose to 4.8 on [**2144-3-24**] and her coumadin was
held.  On [**2144-3-25**] her INR was 4.2.  The presumption was that the
increasing INR was secondary to antibiotics and decreased GI
flora.  No external signs of blood loss and hct stable at 27.
Patient was discharged to an acute care rehab where her coumadin
can be held and her INR can be rechecked in 2 days.  Plan to
hold coumadin for an INR > 3.5.  Goal INR [**2-27**].
