altered mental status/LFTs

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
80 y.o male with h/o CVA in [**12-4**], L4-L5 osteomyelitis,CHF,
atrial fibrillation, presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with altered
mental status, elevated LFTs and jaundice.  He has had
increasing delerium and a worsening gait disorder and word
finding difficulty since mid- [**Month (only) 956**]. His son recalls that it
got worse in the past two weeks. An EEG was scheduled for late
[**Month (only) 958**]. He had an MRI of the head on [**4-2**] which demonstrated an
old right cerebellar CVA which is unchanged. Wrt his
osteomyelitis he had an MRI done on [**4-2**] which demonstrated and
improvement and his ESR was 4 down from a high of 57 in [**2-4**] on
[**2153-3-30**]. His other labs at this time demonstrated elevated
total bili to 2.9, AST = 146, ALT = 209 with an elevated LDH =
348.  His protein C and protien S free and total were found t be
low at 48 (65-130_ and 56 (60-130) respectively.  His PT was
elevated to 3.2.  He was admitted for ? tylenol toxicity since
he had been on standing tylenol at his NH for back pain. Of note
he also recently developed a petechial rash which was biopsied
last week and the biopsy result is pending. In the ED he was
found to have a UTI and ?bibasilar PNA. His INR was elevated but
he was too agitated to have a head CT.  He had a temp of 99.6
and was tachy to 125. He was given levofloxacin, lactulose,
vancomycin after two sets of blood cultures drawn, ativan 0.5 mg
IV, ceftriaxone 2 mg IV, 5 mg haldol, 0.5 mg ativan and 500 mg
flagyl.

DIAGNOSIS
Skin, right lower leg, punch biopsy (A):
Epidermis with dyskeratotic keratinocytes, and subjacent dermis
with perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate and
extravasated red blood cells (see note).
Note:  No vasculitis is seen.  The differential diagnosis of the
histologic pattern seen in this specimen includes
'senile/itching' purpura, a purpuric drug or hypersensitivity
reaction, and a pigmented purpuric eruption.  Clinical
correlation is requested


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
80 y.o. M with htn, atrial fibrillation, CHF, history of
enterococcus bactermia presenting with acute on chronic
worsening of mental status.
.
Altered mental status:
On admission the differential in this gentleman was quite broad
including infection, seizure, cardiac ischemia, CVA, ICH given
elevated INR, malignancy, liver failure.   Possible etiologies
of his infection include UTI, mennigitis, encephalitis,
pneumonia,  The first U/A performed in the ED was a poor sample.
However, levofloxacin was initially administered. Other usual
cultures were sent. CT head showed chronic right cerebellar
hemisphere infarct. Further diagnostic work up was deferred as
the patient's code status changed. A discussion was held with
the patient's son and health care proxy, [**Name (NI) **]. His father
recently made a living will which clearly stated that he did not
want aggressive care in the event of being in his present
non-functional state. The patient's son felt that a code status
change to comfort measures only/do not hospitalize would be
consistent with his father's wishes in his present medical
condition. The patient is to be discharged to [**Hospital1 10151**] today.
.
Elevated coags:
The differential includes dic, coumadin toxicity, vitamin k
deficiency, factor VII deficiency, liver disease. No overt signs
of bleeding.  Will check dic panel. No overt signs of bleeding.
Guaiac negative in ED. As above, further work-up was not pursued
given change in code status.
.
Elevated LFTs; with elevated direct bili thus c/w cholystatic
picuture. Serum tox negative for tylenol. This was concerning
for cholecystitis/cholangitis, though abdomen non-tender on exam
and patient afebrile. Work-up was not pursued given change in
code status.
.
TCP: This was concerning for DIC from possible malignancy or
infection vs HIT. Work-up was not pursued given change in code
status.
.
Prophylaxis: Initially patient given PPI, [**Last Name (un) 12376**] regimen, not on
SQ heparin given elevated INR. Medications were discontinued
with the change in code status to comfort care.
.
