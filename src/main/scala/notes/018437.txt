History of Present Illness:
 Mr. [**Known lastname 13014**] is a 57-year-old man with a history of metastatic
EGFR positive NSCLC with mets to brain, kidney, liver, on
Erlotinib, with recent discharge for pneumonia, who presents
with worsening SOB, cough productive of greenish sputum,
low-grade fever, and fatigue. Per report, he has also had poor
po intake for the past 2 days. He completed course of meropenem
yesterday ([**7-28**]) for PNA. No F/C/sweats/CP/N/V. Sent from rehab
for WBC 24 today.  He has had normal bowel movements, no
diarrhea. He is unable to cough up any sputum.

In ED, initial vitals were: pain 5 T 97.7 HR 89 BP 98/67 RR 18
98%.
Exam was significant for cachectic appearing male, with lungs
clear with good air entry and dry cough.  Labs were significant
for WBC to 24 with 90% PMN's. CXR showed LUL consolidation
largely unchanged. Lactate reassuring at 1.5. Increasing
parenchymal opacification with volume loss on left, cavitation,
which may be associated with increased extent of infection.
Blood cultures were sent. He was given 1g IV Vancomycin x1 in
addition to nebs. Pt given tylenol as well for chronic back
pain.
Final vitals prior to transfer were 99.1 ??????F (37.3 ??????C), Pulse:
94, RR: 14, BP: 100/56, O2Sat: 97.

Imaging:
CXR [**2107-7-29**]:
Persistent extensive left upper lobe consolidation including a
large cavitary component.  Although a left-sided pleural
effusion is probably
reduced, there is increasing parenchymal opacification with
volume loss at the
left base, which may be associated with increased extent of
infection.
Clinical correlation is suggested.

CT Chest [**2107-7-30**]:
While there has been improvement in left-sided moderate pleural
effusion, there are now confluent opacities at the left lower
lobe suggestive of progression of multifocal pneumonia in this
region.  Otherwise, there is stable appearance of consolidation
involving the left upper lobe, left lower lobe, and lingula with
little change in the appearance of left upper lobe cavitary
lesion.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2107-8-3**]:
1.  Advancement of disease, marked by increased size of a
hepatic lesion and an increase in the lytic components of known
osseous disease.  No new
metastatic foci identified.
2.  Significant fecal load.
3.  Likely unchanged metastatic disease to the kidneys,
comparison is
difficult given contrast timing.
4.  Left lower lobe consolidation with volume loss consistent
with known
pneumonia.
