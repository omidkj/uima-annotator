History of Present Illness:
40 yo F with unresectable esophageal cancer who was recently
discharged from the hospital secondary to right neck pain. She
was then discharged on [**12-1**]. Notes indicate the patient
re-presented on [**12-4**] with the chief complaint of "strange
sounding airway" and dyspnea. She was found to have a soft
tissue infection lateral to the esophagus that likely represents
microperforation, for which she was started on abx, and she
required surgical tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction
caused by her esophageal cancer.
.
Additionally, her MICU course was remarkable for persistent
tachycardia and mild hypotension. Her heart rate remains 120s at
rest with brief episodes of rates as high as 150 when she is out
of bed, sinus tachycardia at all times. Her blood pressure has
ranged from 70s-90s systolic, which does not appear to be new,
as OMR notes document systolic blood pressures in the high
80s-low 90s at multiple visits. Evaluation as to the cause of
tachycardia has included TSH (low normal), with fT4 pending;
echo (nml LV and RV function, no echocardiographic signs of
hemodynamically significant PE); ABG 7.46/41/114 was with pt
breathing room air for 10 minutes, indicating that there is no
apparent A-a gradient; a random cortisol level was low, but
responded appropriately to cosyntropin. Since she appears well,
with good skin turgor and adequate urine output, despite the
tachycardia and hypotension, she was transferred out of the ICU.

Pertinent Results:
[**2130-12-4**] Neck CT:
1. No mass lesions are detected within the airway to explain
stridorous
breathing.
2. Fluid again noted within the esophagus in the region of the
thyroid gland. Also noted on prior study, possibly relating to
region of stricture.
3. Slight increase in cavitary lesion within the left lung apex.


NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a collection of air in
the right
neck, apparently just lateral to the esophagus, but possibly
within a dilated esophagus, best seen on images 34-37 of series
2. In this location it raises the possibility of an esophageal
perforation. Since it is difficult to determine the location of
the lateral margin of the esophagus, it is difficult to
distinguish an extraluminal collection from dilatation of the
organ. An MR examination may be helpful.

There is induration of the adjacent tissues, which could be a
consequence of local infection, but also could arise as a result
of prior radiation.
.
[**2130-12-4**] CT CHEST
1. Small pharyngeal or paralaryngeal abscess, phlegmon or
malignancy has
grown over two weeks. If the lesion is inflammatory it suggests
ulceration in the hypopharynx/upper esohagus. Please see report
of today's neck CT.
2. Slow growth of small left upper lobe lung cavity and a tiny
right lower
lobe lesion as well as a new left lower lobe lesion are
concerning for
multifocal metastases, or slow spread of an indolent infection.
Small growing
left pleural mass is more characteristic of metastasis.
.
[**2130-12-6**] MRI SOFT TISSUE NECK, W/O & W/CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 12 x 8 mm collection of air with small amount of
fluid just
anterior to the right aspect of the esophagus at the level of
the thyroid
gland which likely represents esophageal perforation and/or
abscess.
Additional considerations include esophageal diverticulum,
although less
likely.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2130-12-11**] at 2:38:57 PM
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-2-28**], no
change.
.
[**2130-12-12**] CTA CHEST
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. New left posterior pleural lesion. Although this would be an
atypical
location for an esophageal carcinoma meta
