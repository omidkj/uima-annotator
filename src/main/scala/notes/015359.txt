Brief Hospital Course:
AP: [**Age over 90 **] yo F w/h/o recent hospitalization for [**Age over 90 25730**] PNA p/w new RUL
PNA, ear pain, jaw pain and MS changes.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt appear cool and pale, sats in the
80's. Placed on NRB. BP 178/ , HR 120's. Exam concerning for
flash pulmonary edema. 10 mg lopressor, 2 mg morphine, nitro
gtt, lasix 40 mg IV given. ABG 7.21/70/61. Transferred to MICU
for further monitoring. In MICU, given NIPPV, nitro drip. With
control of rate and HTN, patient's BP, HR, O2 sat improved and
patient was called out to floor.
.
#. PNA: Pt was recently discharged from an OSH w/[**Age over 90 25730**] PNA
completing a course of Azithromycin for 2 weeks. Pt represents
with worsening productive cough, and new infiltrate on CXR,
elevated WBC.  She was started on Ceftriaxone and Vanco added
while in MICU for worsening respiratory distress. In setting of
worsening consolidations b/l on CXR, increased WBC and fevers
her ABX were switched to Vanco and Zosyn. Her Ulegionella was
negative and blood cultures were NGTD. She required daily Chest
PT multiple times/day, Atrovent/Albuterol nebs standing, nasal
suction daily as she was very rhonchorous with excessive amounts
on pulmonary consolidation/junk. Sputum w/GPC in pairs. She was
maintained on supplemental O2 sating at 92-94% 2LNC.
.
.
#. Elevated CK/Tn-T: Pt noted to have elevated CE and ST segment
depression in precordial lateral leads. Pt denies any
CP/palpitations or SOB but may be demand ischemia in setting of
multilobar PNA and new onset AF and may not necessarily be
NSTEMI.
*CAD: Pt has no known h/o MI or CAD, however new onset AF.  Her
CE were elevated in setting of HTN, multilobar PNA, EKG changes
c/w demand ischemia. While pt in MICU, per team and family
wishes decided to medically manage and optimize BP control as pt
would not undergo invasive interventions (ie cath). Her CE were
not continued to follow in setting of medical management and
optimized BP, rate control. She was continued on BB, ASA,
Statin. However on [**2121-3-21**] she started to have melena and her
ASA was d/c'd. She remained CP free throughout her course.
.
*PUMP: Pt w/no known h/o CHF but has occasional LE edema, and
elevated BNP
--ECHO showed hyperdynamic EF 70%, no wall motion abnormalities
but showed mild-mod AR. She required 40IV Lasix daily since
[**2121-3-17**] for crackles and pulm edema on CXR.
.
*RHYTHM: Pt w/new onset AF, no h/o being on coumadin in past. In
setting of increased risk vs. benefit, she was not
anticoagulated. She also started to have melena which made
anticoagulating contraindicated.
.
.
# HTN: Pt w/known HTN on Atenolol and HTCZ at home. On
presentation to ED, BP stable, however BP elevated to 220 SBP
while on floor. She was started on Nitro gtt but weaned off
quickly and controlled with BB. Pt also noted to be in RAF and
dilt was added which also helped w/BP control. While on floor
her BP was well controlled on both Dilt and BB. However, she
started to have melena on [**3-21**] and her BB was not titrated up
for BP controlled.
.
#. Melena: Pt started to have melena on [**2121-3-20**]. Pt denied any
abdominal pain, no hematemasis or hematochezia. Pt's hct
remained stable at 28-30. Per pt's family who was very involved
in her care, did not want invasive interventions for the pt.
Options of EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] were brought up but family had not made
decision whether they wanted further invasive procedures for the
pt. She was followed clinically  with serial HCT checks.
.
.
# R sided Ear pain/Temporal/Jaw pain: Pt w/ possible Temporal
arteritis, however no tenderness to palpation over R temporal
area or Jaw area on exam. Difficult to visualize TMs w/poor
anatomy.  ESR sent and level at 36 not concerning for TA.
Continued standing dose of tylenol for analgesia. Head CT also
noted for Possible partial opacification of the right mastoid
air cells.
.
#. MS changes: Pt with MS changes during recent hospitalization
in setting of PNA as well as some MS changes on current
presentation. Pt was put on Remeron at OSH for delirium with
poor effect.  Pt with multiple RF for delirium, ICU delirium, in
different hosp rooms during admission, [**Age over 90 **] years of age, and
multilobar PNA. Per [**Female First Name (un) 1634**] consult and concern for MS changes,
