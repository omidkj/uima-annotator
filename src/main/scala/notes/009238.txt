History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15849**] is a 73 year old gentleman tranferred from [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] ED with concern for bacteremia/endocarditis.  His story
begins 4-5 days ago when he stepped with his L foot on a
splinter while barefoot.  He developed increasing pain, and
sought medical advice while at Tanglewood at the EMT tent.
While there, a nurse used a needle to attempt to extract the
splinter, increasing his pain.  Over the next day or so, he
developed chills and worsening pain, erythema and presented to
an outside ED.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for
further evaluation.
.
In the [**Location (un) 620**] ED, initial vs were: 99.6 128/66 85 22 96% RA.
D-Dimer was checked and elevated, leading to a CTA which
demonstrated diffuse nodules with concern for septic emboli with
effusions.  He was also found to have new pleural effusions.
Patient was first given CTX/Azithro for ? CAP then Vanc,
Cefepime & Gentamicin for ? endocarditis/septic emboli. He was
transferred here for further care. Transfer VS: Tmax 101.6
116/62 78 20 98% 2O NC
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is comfortable and reports
only discomfort with deep inspiration.  He denies other
complaints.

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2118-6-8**]):
      TEST CANCELLED, PATIENT CREDITED.
      SPECIMEN NOT TRANSPORTED ANAEROBICALLY.

Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2118-6-17**]):    NO GROWTH.

EKG [**6-8**]: Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2117-4-19**] there is no change.

Echo [**6-8**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [The amount of
regurgitation present is normal for this prosthetic aortic
valve.] The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis in reasonable quality
study. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
biventricular systolic function. Bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis with trivial aortic regurgitation and mildly
increased transvalvular gradients. If clinically indicated, a
TEE may better assess for vegetations.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-3-21**], the
gradient across the aortic valve is higher.

TEE [**6-10**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque
to 35 cm from the incisors. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets appear normal No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
valve abscess is seen. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No vegetation seen on the aortic, mitral, tricupid
or pulmonic valves. No paravalvar abcess. Normal appearing
bioprosthetic aortic valve. Globally normal LV function.
