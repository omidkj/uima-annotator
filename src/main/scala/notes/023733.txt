History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with recent [**Hospital1 18**] discharge after complicated
hospitalization presenting with a one day history of acute
mental status change, dypsnea and hypoxia. Per the [**Hospital1 1501**] notes,
she was initially noted to be confused on the [**11-12**] shift on
[**2163-6-6**], specifically described as "restless, shouting," and was
given 0.5 mg Ativan and 975 mg acetaminophen and 25 mg of
benadryl. She was up that shift, with visual hallucinations and
crying. Staff was unable to redirect or reorient her. She was
sent to the ED for altered mental status evlaution. She was
given an additional dose of 0.5 mg of Ativan for anxiety without
indicates she was complaining about pain in the left knee.
.
In the ED, vitals were 99.6 BP 120/64 HR 64 R 34, 95% NRB/91%
RA. FSBG was 105. She was treated initially with 10 mg IV
decadron and 2 g IV Cefepime and 1 g Vancomycin. She reported
shortness of breath but denied chest pain. The ED team noted
diffuse wheezing and a nonproductive cough. She was guaiac
negative. She was started on IV fluid, then was treated with
nebs, 2 g of magnesium. She was started on CPAP and initially
had improvement, but was unable to tolerate the mask after 45
minutes. Due to increasing agitation the patient was intubated.
CT head has a questionable lesion and Neurology was consulted.
MRI was recommended. She is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is having generalized
clonus, which resolves with sedation.
.
The patient was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**5-23**] through [**2163-5-31**]
for acute cholecystitis. She was medically managed with
antibiotics. Her course was complicated by sepsis from S.
milleri bacteremia, NSTEMI in the setting of sepsis, respiratory
failure requiring intubation, anuric renal failure and the
development of back pain. Given the bacteremia and NSTEMI, echo
was performed which demonstrated a thickened mitral leaflet. It
was determined that she could not tolerate a TEE and the plan
was for her to complete a 14 day course of zosyn followed by a 6
week course of Pen G for presumed endocarditis.
Discitis/osteomyelitis was considered as the patient complained
of back pain during the hospitalization during a period of
bacteremia, but in the absence of neurologic findings, she was
already planned to have a 6 week course of antibiotics, so no
imaging was pursued.

Imaging:
CT Torso:
1. Diffuse ground-glass opacities predominantly within the upper
lobes which may represent infection and or aspiration. Small
bilateral pleural effusions, slightly enlarged compared to the
prior study. Mild superimpsoed edema noted.
2. Interval decompression of the gallbladder which currently
appears
contracted, with gallbladder wall thickening and a small amount
of
pericholecystic fluid and wall enhancement. These findings may
be consistent with chronic cholecystitis.
3. Stable aneurysm of the right superior pulmonary vein.
.
MRI head: No acute abnormality is seen. There is no evidence for
acute ischemia or abscess.
.
MRI c-spine: Multilevel cervical spondylosis. No definite
evidence for infectious sequela in the cervical spine.
.
CXR [**2163-6-9**]: Stable radiographic exam of the chest with
unchanged position of lines and tubes, stable cardiomegaly and
bibasilar opacification likely atelectasis.
.
ECHO: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with infero-lateral
hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is minimal functional
mitral stenosis due to mitral annular calcification. Mild to
moderate ([**1-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
