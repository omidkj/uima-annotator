Chief Complaint:
tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
84 year old female with history of atrial flutter, CAD s/p CABG
[**2159**], HTN presents with asymptomatic tachycardia. Patient was
previously discharged from hospital on [**2162-12-1**] after being
admitted on [**11-29**] for asymptomatic tachycardia. Patient was noted
to be in atrial flutter on previous admission that converted
back to sinus with fluid administration alone. During her
previous admission, patient was seen and evaluted by EP who
reccomending continuing current management without change in
medications. Please see previous discharge summary for furthur
discharge info. It appears that 2 days after discharge patient
was back in atrial flutter (ie since [**Month/Day (1) 2974**]) looking at ob/gyn
note in OMR with HRs in 140s. Patient has regular VNA services
at home, and this morning VNA thought that the patient was in
afib with heart rate in the 140s. At that time patient with
stable BP 112/70. As per VNA patient is patient was completely
asymptomatic, afebrile, without chest pain or shortness of
breath. Non specific ECG changes.
.
Patient was transported to our ED for further eval. On arrival
to ED her vitals were T 97.1 BP 129/70 HR 143 RR 18 98% RA.
Patient was in atrial flutter. Cardiology was consulted. Patient
was given IV diltiazem 10 mg x 2 and IV metoprolol 5 mg x 2 per
verbal ED signout. Patient then dropped her pressures to 88/46
with no change in heart rate and was given total of 3 liters of
NS boluses per ED verbal signout.
.
On arrival to MICU her symptoms were T 96.9 HR 140s BP 109/73 RR
15 99% RA. Patient denies any fever, chills, nightsweats, cough,
cold, chest pain, shortness of breath, PND, orhtopnea, abdominal
pain, dysuria, hematuria, blood in stool or urine, weakness,
numbness. Her diarrhea has resolved. Stable chronic back pain.
No other complaints.

.
[**2162-12-7**] CXR
Since [**2162-12-5**], mild interstitial edema is new. Prior
sternotomy for CABG was performed. There is no significant
pleural effusion. Heart size is top normal. The aorta is
tortuous and calcified. There is no focal area of consolidation.
Minimal indentation on the right tracheal wall could be due to a
thyroid nodule, should be evaluated by [**Year (4 digits) 950**] if not already
known.
.
[**2162-12-5**] CXR
PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The patient is
rotated to the left which limits evaluation of the heart size.
The aorta is tortuous and calcified. The hilar contours are
unremarkable. There are low lung volumes bilaterally. Small
amount of left pleural effusion is noted.

IMPRESSION: Limited study, but no acute intrathoracic pathology.



Brief Hospital Course:
84F w CAD (s/p CABG), a-fib and a-flutter (s/p DCCV and
cavotrunkal isthmus ablation), admitted with asymptomatic
tachycardia after discharge on [**2162-12-1**] for same issue.
.
# RHYTHM - Patient with a history of atrial flutter s/p DC
cardioversion in [**6-/2162**], and subsequent empirical CTI ablation
in the setting of noninducible SVT. She was in atrial flutter
with HR 140s on admission, therapeutically anticoagulated.
Coumadin was held and heparin gtt started. EP saw her and
recommended cardioversion.  She had been therapeutic on her
Coumadin for the past 8 weeks. Cardioversion was successful
after one 200 J shock. She was subsequently hemodynamically
stable with wandering atrial pacemaker in the 80s.  Amiodarone
was started at 200mg TID, and Coumadin was restarted at 1mg
(half home dose because of known interaction with amiodarone).
She will need outpatient PFTs for baseline on amiodarone as well
as regular INR checks / Coumadin dose adjustments. Her
amiodarone will be TID for 5 days, then [**Hospital1 **] for 14 days, then
once a day.
.
# CORONARIES - patient with a history of CAD s/p CABGx4 in [**2159**].
No acute issues. Pt discharged on aspirin 81mg daily, ToprolXL
150mg daily. Enalapril reduced to 5mg PO daily due to increased
creatinine. Simvastatin switched to pravastatin 80mg daily due
to interaction with amiodarone.
.
# PUMP ?????? She had chronic systolic congestive heart failure
(LVEF=30-35% on TTE in 8/[**2161**]). She initially appeared
euvolemic.  After receiving 3 L of fluid in the ED, she
developed acute respiratory distress several hours after her
cardioversion.  BP was elevated to 200/120, she was transferred
back to the CCU overnight.  Shortness of breath improved with IV
Lasix, and she was thought to have had flash pulmonary edema.
Pt's symptoms resolved and she was restarted on home medications
and sent back to the regular cardiology floor.
.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE - Cr on admission was 1.2, up from
baseline of 0.9-1.0, likely pre-renal from recent diarrhea and
poor forward flow from heart failure. ACE inhibitor was held,
then restarted on a lower dose (enalapril 5mg daily).
.
# Thalassemia - Low MCV and normal serum iron level were
consistent with a known diagnosis of thalassemia. Hematocrit on
admission was 35 which is relatively stable.
.
# Hyperlipidemia - Discharged on pravastatin.
.
# Thyroid nodule- seen on CXR, needs follow up [**Year (4 digits) 950**] as out
pt. TSH was 1.7 at baseline before starting amiodarone.
.
Pt will be discharged home with VNA. Cardiology and PCP follow
up are planned, as well as a thyroid [**Year (4 digits) 950**] and PFTs. Her
PCP will be following her INR.
