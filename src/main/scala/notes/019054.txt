[**2110-2-26**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three
vessel disease. The LMCA had a 90% distal stenosis. The LAD
stents were
patent with a 70% diagonal lesion. The LCx had diffuse proximal
disease
to 70% with severe angulation. The RCA was known to be totally
occluded
and therefore not injected, with the distal vessel filled via
left-to-right collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated right and
left heart
filling pressures with RVEDP 26 mmHg and PCWP 32 mmHg. There was
severe
pulmonary artery hypertension with PASP 62 mmHg. The cardiac
index was
preserved at 2.5 L/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was
normal.
The pulmonary vascular resistance was elevated at 189
dyn-sec/cm5. There
was systemic arterial normotension
.
[**2110-2-27**] ECHO PRE BYPASS:
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30
%). The lateral wall displays severe hypokinesis. The right
ventricle displays mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

[**2110-2-27**] ECHO POST BYPASS:
The patient is being a-paced. The right ventricle displays
normal systolic function. Overall left ventricular function was
initially improved post-bypass with an ejection fraction of
about 50% and moderate lateral wall hypokinesis. 30 minutes
after bypass, overall function was reduced with mild to moderate
global hypokinesis and moderate to severe hypokinesis of the
lateral wall. Overall ejection fraction at that time was 40%.
Valvular function was unchanged from pre-bypass study, The
thoracic aorta appears intact.

[**2110-3-5**] Discharge Chest x-ray: There is improved pulmonary
ventilation, with minimal residual left lower lobe atelectasis.
Small bilateral effusions persist. Mild cardiomegaly is stable,
with median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips. There is no
pneumothorax. Prominent colonic loops are again seen in the
abdomen, without free air.


Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in on [**2110-2-25**] evening for cardiac evaluation and
underwent cardiac catheterization.  He was found to have
significant coronary artery disease(see cardiac cath report) and
cardiac surgery was consulted. Given critical left main lesion,
an IABP was placed without complication. He underwent
preoperative workup and was brought to the operating room on
[**2110-2-27**] for coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  See operative
report for further details.  He received vancomycin for
perioperative antibiotics because he was in the hospital for
greater than 24 hours prior to surgery.  Postoperatively he was
was taken to the intensive care unit for management.  That
evening he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically
intact, and was extubated without incident.  The intra aortic
balloon pump was weaned on removed on post operative day one
without complication.  He remained in the intensive care unit
for hemodynamic and diabetes management.  On post operative day
four he was transferred to the floor.  He remained in a normal
sinus rhythm. He was noted to have a leukocytosis with no
obvious source of infection(toe ulcer potential source but did
not appear infected). He remained afebrile. Pan cultures were
taken and remained negative. By discharge, his leukocytosis
stabilized. Over several days, he continued to make clinical
improvements with diuresis and was cleared for discharge to home
on postoperative day seven. Given his low ejection fraction, he
will remain on Lasix at discharge. Given his mild chronic renal
insufficiency(baseline creatinine 1.3) and potassium levels
remained between 4.0 - 5.0, potassium supplements were not given
at discharge.
