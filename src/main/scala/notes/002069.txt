History of Present Illness:
84 year-old male h/o COPD, HTN who presented to [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital with sudden onset back pain on [**2156-1-31**]. He reports that
he was answering the phone
yesterday at approximately 10AM when there was sudden severe
midline upper back.  The pain resolved, however, recurred 2
hours later.  He notified his primary care, who is also a
cardiologist, who sent him to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital.  He
underwent a CT scan there which showed a type B dissection
starting that the takeoff of the left subclavian enxtending to
the origin of the celiac trunk, with it originating off the true
axis.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2156-2-1**] for further

[**2156-2-2**]:FINDINGS:
CT CHEST: Within the lung parenchyma, there is a small left
pleural effusion as well as associated compressive atelectasis.
Dependent atelectasis on the right is also present. Several
pleural-based calcifications are noted posteriorly. No
pneumothorax is seen. The airways are patent to the segmental
level. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen. There
are aortic and coronary artery vascular calcifications. No
pericardial effusion is seen. Please see below for CT
angiography.

CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: There is fatty deposition within the
liver. The
patient is status post cholecystectomy. The spleen, pancreas,
and adrenal
glands appear grossly normal. The kidneys contain multiple
hypodensities,
incompletely characterized on this examination. A 2.8 cm
hypodensity in the right kidney (4:136) is most compatible with
a simple cyst. Multiple
additional hypodensities are incompletely evaluated. Loops of
small and large bowel are of normal size and caliber.
Within the pelvis, distal loops of large bowel and rectum appear
grossly
unremarkable. There is colonic diverticulosis. The bladder and
distal
ureters are normal. The prostate gland is enlarged measuring up
to 5.5 cm in diameter. No free air, free fluid, or
lymphadenopathy is seen. There is a fat-containg right inguinal
hernia.

BONE WINDOWS: No concerning osseous lesion is seen.

CTA: Again seen is a thoracic aortic aneurysm beginning distal
to the origin of the left subclavian artery (type B). Multiple
mural calcifications are noted at the origin of the dissection
and along the true lumen. The dissection extends to the level of
the origin of the celiac artery. The celiac artery itself has
several calcifications with some narrowing at the origin;
however, appears to opacify with contrastand likely originates
from the true lumen.

The superior mesenteric artery, bilateral renal arteries, and
inferior
mesenteric artery are patent and are supplied by the true lumen.
There is
mild narrowing of the right renal artery due to atherosclerosis
at the origin. The false lumen does opacify with contrast,
though to a lesser extent. At the level of the aortic hiatus,
there is non-opacification of the false lumen suggesting the
presence of thrombus. The overall diameter of the aorta at the
level of the hiatus measures 3.9 x 3.9 cm (4:95), aneurysmal.
Vascular calcifications extend throughout the aorta into the
bilateral iliac arteries.  The iliac arteries measure up to 1.6
cm bilaterally, mildly aneurysmal.

Incidental note is made of a common origin of the
brachiocephalic artery and left common carotid artery (bovine
arch configuration). The origin of the common hepatic artery is
off the superior mesenteric artery.

IMPRESSION: Type B aortic dissection extending from just distal
to the origin of the left subclavian artery to the level of the
celiac artery, which appears mildly narrowed. Partial thrombosis
of the false lumen. Mild narrowing of right renal artery due to
atherosclerosis.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90109**] was admitted to the ICU on [**2156-2-1**] for Type B
dissection of the aorta without aortic leak (takeoff of left
subclavian to celiac axis) for blood pressure control. He was
initially started on Esmolol and Nipride drips in the Emergency
Room, which were weaned off and changed to labetolol drip for
goal SBP less than 120. A radial A-line was placed and his blood
pressure was closely monitored. He ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. He was started on an increased dose of metoprolol,
in an addition to his home medications and the labetolol was
weaned off. On HD 2, his creatinine peaked at 1.5. There was
concern for extension of dissection to renal arteries, so repeat
CTA was performed. Repeat CTA was unchanged. His renal
insuffiency was then thought to be due to dye load for CTA, so
he received sodium bicarbonate, mucomyst, and IV fluid and
creatinine trended down to 1.2. His diet was advanced and he was
transferred to the floor on [**2-2**] for further monitoring. At the
time of discharge on HD 3, his systolic blood pressure ranged
between 120-140 and creatinine was stable at 1.2.

Medications on Admission:
Pravastatin 40mg daily
Accupril 40mg daily
Metoprolol 75mg [**Hospital1 **]
