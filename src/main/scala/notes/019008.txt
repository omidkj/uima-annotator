EKG [**11-10**]:
Sinus tachycardia
Possible right atrial abnormality
Borderline right axis deviation
rsr' in lead V1
Modest ST-T wave changes
Findings are nonspecific - within normal limits for possible in
part right
ventricular overload
Since previous tracing of the same date, preocrdial lead T waves
less prominent

Imaging:
CT C-Spine [**11-10**]:
CONCLUSION:
1. Deformity of the anteroinferior body of C2 with a
well-corticated bony
fragment projected anteriorly suggestive of an old injury.
2. There is apparent asymmetry in the distance between the
odontoid and the
lateral masses of C1 which may be due to rotatory subluxation
versus
positional and can be imaged further as per clinical need.
3. Fracture through the right lateral transverse process of T1
which has the appearance of subacute/chronic injury.
4. Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine with
most
significant disc narrowing at C6-7.

Head CT [**11-10**]:
18-mm left subdural hematoma with mass effect and midline shift
towards the
right of approximately 11 mm. Acute hemorrhage is also seen in
the left
sylvian fissure as well as the right thalamus and fourth
ventricle. There is subfalcine and subtentorial herniation with
loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation suggesting raised intracranial pressure.

CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis [**11-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Comminuted fracture of the distal right clavicle and would
recommend
dedicated films to further evaluate. Multiple nondisplaced
chronic-appearing rib fractures.
2. Filling defect within the right portal vein, which could
represent non-
occlusive thrombus and would recommend ultrasound evaluation to
further
evaluate. There is an IVC filter present within the IVC, which
is infrarenal. There are right-sided dependent lung
consolidations which could represent aspiration or lung
contusion. There is a small right apical pneumothorax and right
apical blebs.
3. There is an endotracheal tube present in satisfactory
position.
4. There is diffuse fatty liver.
5. The right testicle is high within the inguinal canal and
could be related to patient's trauma.

Head CT [**11-10**](post-surgery):
IMPRESSION:
1. Reduction in size of large left convexity subdural hematoma
with decreased mass effect and decreased rightward subfalcine
herniation as described.
Persistent rightward uncal herniation noted.
2. Right thalamic and potential right midbrain small
intraparenchymal
hemorrhages.
3. Persistent enlargement of the right lateral ventricle with
transependymal resorption of CSF noted.

LENIS [**11-17**]:IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombosis of the right
common femoral vein.

Head CT [**11-11**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval decrease in size of left subdural hematoma,
associated midline
shift and mass effect and resolution of left uncal herniation.
2. Left temporal hypodensity may relate to evolving infarction.
Continued
attention on followup studies is recommended.
3. Thalamic and brainstem hemorrhages appear stable.

[**2128-11-23**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Final Report

IMPRESSION:

1. No new intracranial hemorrhage or significant changes since
prior scan.
2. Mild improvement in rightward midline shift from 3 mm to 2
mm. Hypodensity
seen within the right thalamus consistent with evolution of
previously noted hemorrhage in this area.


EEG [**2128-12-2**]

IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the right
fronto-central
slowing and due to the relatively monotonous mildly slow
background
throughout. The first abnormality suggests a focal subcortical
dysfunction in the left anterior quadrant. The tracing cannot
specify
the etiology. Nevertheless, there were no clearly epileptiform
features
there or elsewhere. The widespread 7 Hz rhythm suggests a
widespread
encephalopathy, with a regularity raising the possibility of
medication
effect.

Head CT [**12-15**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Patient is status post cranioplasty. Hyperdense area adjacent
to the
left frontal lobe in subdural location that is likely secondary
to post-
operative changes, however, cannot exclude small amount of
subdural
hemorrhage. Possible mild cerebrale dema without shift of
midline
structures, likely due to post-surgical changes. Recommend close
followup as clinically indicated. Expected post- operative
changes with pneumocephalus, extra-axial air, and soft tissue
swelling.

Head CT [**12-17**]
IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in size of fluid collection, with
decrease in mass effect upon left frontal hemisphere. Associated
decrease in left to right shift of midline structures.
Persistent edema and mass effect.
Hypodensities both occipital lobes are unchanged.

Head CT [**12-23**]
MPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of a small left frontal epidural fluid
collection with mild mass effect upon the left frontal
hemisphere. No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
2. Low attenuation subgaleal fluid collection at the
cranioplasty site which could relate to postoperative change,
although its persi
