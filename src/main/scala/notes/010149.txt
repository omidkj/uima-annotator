Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for Pulmonary stent

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 86 year old male with CAD s/p CABG, AS s/p AVR and CRI
presenting with a lung mass for a bronchoscopy at an OSH.  The
patient is intubated at this time and history is obtained from
the records. The patient was in his usual state of health until
[**11-25**] when he developed progressive dyspnea on exertion.  He had
a mechanical fall in [**Month (only) 404**] or [**2121-12-19**] and a CXR was
performed to evaluate for a rib fracture.  Xray demonstrated a
right lung mass. CT chest done on [**2122-1-13**] demonstrated a
spiculated, ill-defined mass in the RUL, 6 cm, surrounding the
RUL bronchus and marked narrowing of the bronchus with
lymphadenopathy.  He underwent a scheduled bronchoscopy on
[**2122-1-28**] which demonstrated marked airway tumor in the right
upper lobe extending into the right bronchus intermidius. The
airways were not completely obstructed, but there was reported
marked narrowing with significant secretions. Bronchial
washings, brushings and biopsies of the lesion were done. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management given the airway
involvement.  He remained intubated for transfer. Cytology from
the OSH demonstrated Squamous cell carcinoma.
.
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was evaluated by the
interventional pulmonary team. He had a repeat bronchoscopy
performed which demonstrated right upper lobe mucosal thickening
and friability as well as a probably neoplasm with endobronchial
involvement. The airways were considered safe for extubation.
Biopsies, brushings and washings were repeated and the patient
was prepared for extubation.

Chest XRAY [**2122-1-30**]
1. Endotracheal tube and orogastric tube in standard position.
2. Large right perihilar mass, reportedly a known finding, and
concerning for lung neoplasm.
3. Persistent small pleural effusions versus pleural thickening.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2122-2-1**]
1. No evidence of metastatic disease on non-contrast CT scan,
although MRI remains more sensitive for this indication.
2. Mild opacification of the right sphenoid sinus.
