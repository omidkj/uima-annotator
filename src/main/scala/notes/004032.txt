Admission Date:  [**2109-11-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2109-11-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**2109-11-15**]       Sex:  M

Service:  NEONATAL

HISTORY:  This is a full term baby boy transferred from the
Well Baby Nursery at 48 hours of age to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and management of
tachypnea and increased work of breathing.

The baby is a 3315 gram baby boy [**Name2 (NI) **] to a 30 year old
Gravida 4, P 2 to 3 mother with prenatal screens of maternal
blood type of A positive, antibody negative, hepatitis
surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune,
Group B Streptococcus negative.  There is a benign prepartum
course notable only for Zoloft secondary to depression.
There was an uncomplicated vaginal delivery with no perinatal
risk factors for sepsis, short second stage, presence of
meconium stained amniotic fluid.  Rupture of membranes were
minutes before delivery with no maternal fever, no
intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.

Resuscitation required only blow-by oxygen and routine care
in the delivery room with Apgars of 8 at one minute and 10 at
five minutes.  The baby boy was transferred to the Well Baby
Nursery, where he was eating well with no concerns until the
night prior to transfer to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
when he was evaluated for tachypnea, felt to be mildly
symptomatic and attributed to retained fetal lung fluid;
however, in the morning he was noted to still be tachypneic
with mild intermittent retractions, therefore transferred to
the NICU for further evaluation.

On initial physical examination, his oxygen saturation was
91% in room air with respiratory rates ranging from 40s to
70s.  Overall, he was well appearing, non-dysmorphic.
Anterior fontanel was soft, open and flat.  The palate was
intact.  Breath sounds were clear with intermittent tachypnea
and subcostal retractions.  Cardiovascular examination was
reportedly without murmur initially.  The abdomen was benign
without any hepatosplenomegaly, no masses, with normal male
genitals with bilateral descended testes.  He had a normal
back.  His extremities and skin were warm and well perfused.
He had normal tone, strength, and responsivity.

INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  This is a 48 hour old male with mild but
persistent respiratory symptoms, still most likely to be
transitional physiology, but concerning because of delayed
onset of respiratory distress on day of life number two.
Therefore, he was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care
Unit for evaluation for infection.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  RESPIRATORY:  The infant initially required nasal cannula
at a flow of 100 cc per minute of 100% special inspired
oxygen.  Over the next two days, he was gradually weaned off
of nasal cannula to room air.  By day of life number five, he
was saturating in the high 90s in room air, and by the time
of discharge, he was no longer tachypneic, saturating in the
high 90s in room air, with clear breath sounds and no
retractions.

His initial chest x-ray on admission showed minimally hazy
lung fields, right greater than left, possibly consistent
with a transient tachypnea of the newborn, but not able to
rule out pneumonia.  The cardiac was normal.  No further
imaging studies were done.

At the time of discharge, he had no respiratory issues.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  He remained stable throughout his
admission from a cardiovascular standpoint with normal heart
rates and blood pressures; however, on day of life three, a
soft murmur was noted.  A cardiac evaluation was initiated.
As mentioned previously, the chest x-ray showed a normal
cardiac silhouette.  Four extremity blood pressures were
normal.

By the time of discharge, pre and post room air saturations
were well over 95% with no differential saturation.

An EKG was performed on day of life six and repeated on day
of life seven, which when reviewed by Cardiology, seemed to
be indicative of mild right sided predominant voltages within
normal limits for age.  Cardiology examined and evaluated
this baby, and concluded that he had no significant cardiac
disease.  His soft systolic murmur persisted throughout his
admission.  He has no active cardiac issues at this time.

His initial blood sugar was 65.  Because he was not in
significant respiratory distress on admission, he was
continued on ad lib exclusive breast feeding.  Throughout his
admission, he breast fed extremely well, typically every one
to two hours.  He was gaining weight very well.  At the time
of discharge, his weight was 3475 grams, up from his birth
weight of 3315 grams.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  For initial sepsis evaluation, a CBC
was sent with a white blood cell count of 14.4, 70% polys, 2%
bands, 1% metamyelocytes, 23% lymphocytes, for an  ITT ratio
of 4%.  Hematocrit was 43, platelets 422.  Blood cultures
were sent which remained no growth to date.  Because of the
mild chest x-ray abnormalities, he was started on Ampicillin
and gentamicin on admission and completed a seven day course
on [**11-23**].  A gentamicin level after three doses were
within the normal range.

A lumbar puncture was performed on day of life three, one day
after initiation of antibiotics.  It showed 22 white blood
cells, 56,000 red blood cells which cleared during the tap,
protein of 193, glucose 61, negative Gram stain, and negative
cerebrospinal fluid cultures.  He will have completed a seven
day course of Ampicillin, gentamicin for presumed pneumonia
on [**11-23**].

4.  SENSORY:  A hearing screen was performed with automated
auditory brain stem responses with normal results in both
ears; however, because of the seven day course of gentamicin,
repeat testing in 3 months is recommended.

5.  ROUTINE HEALTH CARE
MAINTENANCE:  Newborn screen was sent
on [**11-17**] with the results pending.  Hepatitis B vaccine
was administered on [**11-17**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To home.

PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 53585**] at the South
[**Location (un) 538**] Health Center.  I believe Dr.[**Name (NI) 53586**] phone
number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 53587**].

CARE/RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Continue ad lib breast feeding.
2.  Medications at discharge only included multivitamin
because of the exclusive breast feeding.
3.  State Newborn Screen is still pending.
4.  Hepatitis B number one has been given.
5.  Follow-up Auditory Brain Stem Response
testing should be done in 3 months as above

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Respiratory distress.
2.  Presumed pneumonia.
3.  Benign cardiac murmur.
