Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
CAD s/p cath for pain control and groin site mointoring

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cath

History of Present Illness:
74 year-old M with DM2 and CAD s/p stent placement in [**12-29**] who
presents from [**Hospital 191**] clinic with dyspnea and anginal equivalent,
transferred to CCU s/p cardiac cath.  He has had symptoms of
progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and intermittent angina for 2
  weeks, but refused ED evaluation last week.  In the ED his EKG
showed changes with troponin 0.94, CK 450 with MB 24.  He was
given plavix, aspirin, metoprolol, and heparinized prior to
urgent cath lab evaluation.  In the cath lab CO 3.52, CI 1.70,
PCW 19, RA 16, PA 76/31, RV 78/9.  He underwent placement of
drug eluting stent in the LMCA to the LCx.  During the procedure
he was agitated due to Left leg and groin pain; due to concern
for groin sheath safety, he was admitted to the CCU for
monitoring.
.
ROS: No history of bleeding, ulcer, CVA/TIA, claudication.  Has
significant history of b/t LE neuropathy.  His anginal
equivalent is tightness between the shoulders.  Pt denies fever
or chills. Denied chest pain, cough, palpitations.  + nausea; no
emesis, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.


Past Medical History:
CAD s/p silent MI in [**2156**] (found to have 100% mid LAD stenosis),
s/p NSTEMI in [**11-28**] -> staged percutaneous interventions of
multivessel disease.  Left main distal 40% lesion.  LAD long 90%
lesion in the mid vessel.  Ostial left circumflex had a 90%
lesion; ostial right coronary artery had a probable 70% lesion.
Severe pulmonary HTN with a systolic PA pressure of 83 mmHg and
a mean pressure of 53 mmHg.  His overall LVEF was 40-45%.  s/p

Cardiac Cath:
1. Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with
three
vessel disease.  The LMCA showed a 60% stenosis at the origin.
The LAD
showed severe, diffuse stenoses up to 90% from the proximal
segment to
the distal segment.  The LCx showed a 90% proximal instent
restenosis
with diffuse stenoses of the OM1 and OM2 branches at 60-70%.
The RCA
showed 40% instent restenosis with 30-50% stenoses in the mid-
and
distal segments, with a discrete 70% stenosis of a large
posterolateral
branch.
 2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated severely elevated
pulmonary artery
pressures of 82/30, with moderately elevated mean pulmonary
capillary
wedge pressure of 21mmHg and mean right atrial pressure of
17mmHg.  The
gradient between diastolic pulmonary pressure and pulmonary
capillary
wedge pressure is suggestive of increased pulmonary vascular
resistance.
The cardiac output was severely depressed at 1.7 L/min/m2.
 3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LCX with a 3.5
x 16
Taxus DES which was deployed in the left main extending into the
LCx and
post dilated with a 4.5 balloon. Final angiography revealed
normal flow,
no dissection, and 0% residual stenosis. (See PTCA comments)
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
4. Successful PCI of the LCx.
.
Echo ([**2167-7-10**]): LVEF 40%
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is
moderately depressed. Distal anterior, distal septal, apical,
distal inferior
and distal lateral akinesis is present.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared with the report of the prior study (images
unavailable for review)
of [**2166-12-24**], there is no significant change.
.
CXR ([**2167-7-9**] and [**2167-7-10**]): Low lung volumes with no evidence of
overt congestive heart failure.


Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo M with CAD, DM, CHF with EF 40-45% who presents with chest
pain s/p cardiac cath, with pulm HTN.
.
* ischemia: significant h/o CAD as above, lipid panel in [**1-26**]
showed TC 129, HDL 49, LDL 64, TG 79.  max trop at 1.10. Pt was
continued on ASA, plavix, statin, and Toprol XL. Echo showed no
significant change from prior.
.
* pump: has history of CHF, with EF 40-45%.  pro-BNP elevated.
elevated right-sided filling pressures and pulmonary
hypertension was felt to possibly be related to elevated
left-sided filling pressures or underlying pulmonary disease
(hypoxic as well).  PVR 680 (nl <200). He was diuresed with
lasix and CXR improved. Digoxin was d/c'd as it was not clear
why this medication was started given that he has not been
overly symptomatic with heart failure symptoms. He was continued
on his [**Last Name (un) **]. As above, echo showed no significant changes from
prior. He was discharged on an increased dose of lasix to
hopefully prevent future volume overload.
.
* rhythym - no active issues
.
* hypoxia - likely from CHF, also history of smoking in past.
O2was weaned as diuresis occurred.
.
* DM: HbA1c 7.6 in [**12-29**]; repeat HbA1c= 7.4. He was continued on
his home lantus with humalog SSI. Actos and metformin were
restarted on discharge.
.
* neuropathy - not currently on pain meds and pt was not
interested in pain medications of any type due to h/o substance
abuse. He was given tylenol prn.
.
* anemia: Hct was seen to drop slightly during admission, but
this was felt to be secondary to lab draws and small amount of
blood loss during cath. He will followup to have his labs drawn
in the next few days given the increase in lasix dose and Hct
will be rechecked as well.
