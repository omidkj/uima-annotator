BILAT HIPS (AP,LAT & AP PELVIS)  [**2177-6-26**] 6:32 PM

BILAT HIPS (AP,LAT & AP PELVIS

Reason: Please eval fracture

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old man with rectal cancer, s/p R hip fracture in [**Month (only) 958**]
[**2177**]
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval fracture
BILATERAL HIPS [**2177-6-26**]:

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Rectal cancer status post right hip
fracture marginally.

FINDINGS:

AP view of the pelvis and two coned down views of the right hip
are submitted. Comparison is made with the CT of the abdomen and
pelvis from [**2177-3-30**] which demonstrates a lytic destructive
lesion of the right acetabulum. Since the prior study, there has
been interval progression of the destructive lesion within the
right acetabulum and iliac bone. There is now destruction of the
acetabular wall with medial migration of the femoral head. There
is medial displacement of the acetabular wall into the pelvis.
There is a lucency at the femoral head-neck junction which may
represent a non-displaced fracture. Further evaluation with CT
or MRI is recommended.

Evaluation for fine osseous detail is limited by the osteopenia.

There are multiple lytic lesions throughout the osseous pelvis
and the left femur as well. There is old osseous deformity of
the left proximal femur. There is severe degenerative change in
the lower lumbar spine.

IMPRESSION:

1) Progression of large lytic destructive lesion in the right
acetabulum and iliac bone with fracture of the medial acetabular
wall with displacement of fracture medially into the pelvis.

2) Question non-displaced fracture of the femoral neck at the
subcapital region.

3) Old fracture deformity of the left proximal femur. Further
evaluation with CT or MRI is recommended.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2177-6-27**] 10:32 AM

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS

Reason: BILATERAL LEG EDEMA, ?DVT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old man with colon Cancer, pathalogic fracture of hip,
bilateral lower extremity swelling, R>L.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
DVT?
INDICATION: Bilateral lower extremity swelling, right greater
than left.

COMPARISON: None.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: The right and left
common femoral, greater saphenous, superficial femoral,
popliteal demonstrate wall- to-wall flow and normal
compressibility and response to Valsalva and augmentation.
Wall-to-wall flow is seen in the posterior and tibial veins
bilaterally. Edema is seen in both legs.

IMPRESSION: No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for DVT; edema.

Bone Scan:
Whole body images of the skeleton and planar views of the thorax
were obtained in anterior and posterior projections. Images show
focal abnormal uptake of tracer in the right acetabulum and
right inferior pubic ramus. Increased uptake is seen within the
left proximal femur diaphysis associated with bony deformity.
Additionally there is focal uptake in the bilateral shoulders,
right greater than left, as well as the bilateral knees, right
greater than left consistent with degenerative changes. Focal
uptake within the distal ends of the 11th and 7th left ribs is
likely secondary to prior trauma.

The above described findings are consistent with focal tracer
uptake within the known lytic lesion in the right acetabulum as
well as within the right inferior pubic ramus, concerning for
metastatic disease.

The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route
of tracer
excretion.

IMPRESSION: 1. Focal tracer uptake within the known lytic lesion
of the right acetabulum and pubic symphysis, concerning for
metastatic disease. 2. Likely degenerative changes of the
bilateral shoulders and knees.

CT guided biopsy:
PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The risks and benefits of the procedure were
explained to the patient and informed written consent was
obtained. Preprocedural timeout was performed confirming the
patient's identity and the procedure to be undertaken.

The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position on
the CT scanner. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual
sterile fashion. Using 10 cc of 1% lidocaine for local
anesthesia, under direct CT fluoroscopic guidance, a 14-gauge
coaxial needle was inserted into the destructive lytic lesion
within the right ilium. Subsequently, five core biopsy samples
were obtained with a 15-gauge biopsy gun device with the samples
were placed in formalin. Additionally, one core biopsy sample
was placed in CytoLite for cytology analysis. Patient tolerated
the procedure well and there were no immediate post-procedural
complications. Dry sterile dressing was placed.

Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of
Versed and fentanyl throughout the total intraservice time of 10
minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were
continuously monitored. A total dose of 25 mcg of fentanyl and
0.5 mg of Versed were administered.

The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 76802**] Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], the
attending radiologist, present and supervising throughout.

IMPRESSION: Technically successful CT-guided core biopsy of
right iliac bone lesion

DIAGNOSIS:

Right iliac lytic lesion, biopsy (A):

Connective tissue, scan
