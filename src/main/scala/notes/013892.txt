recently completed a course of Levaquin for bronchitis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Non-small cell lung cancer, Stage IIIA, [**2140**]; radiation
therapy, aspergillosis, left empyema, bronchopleurocutaneous
fistula

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post left lobectomy in [**2140**],
status post multiple chest wall debridements, status post
omental pedicle [**12-19**] pectoralis flap for closure of
bronchopleurocutaneous fistula

ALLERGIES:  Ampicillin, erythromycin, amphotericin

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Trazodone 150 mg once daily,
Tylenol

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile, sinus rhythm, blood pressure
110/70, oxygen saturation 99% on room air.  Right chest clear
to auscultation, left side bronchial sounds, decreased breath
sounds on the left.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended,
bowel sounds positive.  Extremities warm and well perfused.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cells 14, hematocrit 34,
platelets 530.  Sodium 139, potassium 4.5, chloride 99,
bicarbonate 28, BUN 9, creatinine .7, glucose 81.  Chest CT:
No pulmonary embolus, left upper lobe lesion, emphysematous
changes bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  He was hemodynamically stable.
The patient underwent bronchial arteriography looking for
possible bleeding source, which was not identified.  No
evidence of pulmonary embolus on CTA.  On the second day, he
was transferred to a regular floor.  He was also started on
Levaquin on the day of admission.

Over the next couple of days, the patient remained stable,
afebrile, with no increase in his white blood cell count,
continuing cough with copious yellow-green discharge.
Cultures were pending, however, given the patient's history,
the possibility of ongoing infection was high, and the
patient was started on Flagyl for empiric treatment on [**6-16**].  He was transfused a unit of red blood cells for a
falling hematocrit without complications.

From [**6-16**] to [**6-20**], the patient had a few episodes of
fever which resolved by themselves.  He had multiple blood,
sputum, urine and stool cultures, which all turned out
unremarkable.  The patient continued with copious hemoptysis
and yellow-green sputum, otherwise remained stable.

On [**6-21**], he was taken to an operating room and left
incision and drainage of empyema and rigid bronchoscopy were
done.  He was transfused two units of packed red blood cells
for a low hematocrit.  The operation went without
complications.  The patient was transferred to the
Post-Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.

After his surgery, the patient was transferred to the
Thoracic Surgery service.  On postoperative day number one,
the patient was afebrile.  Vital signs were stable.  Dressing
changes twice a day were performed.  On [**6-23**], the patient
was again taken to the operating room, where re-exploration
of the left empyema was undertaken.  The operation went
without complications.  The patient was transferred to the
Post-Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.
Intraoperative examination showed the patient continued to
have a bronchopleural fistula.  Intraoperative cultures were
growing gram-negative rods.

Over the next few days, the patient remained afebrile, vital
signs stable.  The amount of purulent sputum has decreased,
however, did not disappear completely.  On postoperative day
three, gram-negative rods was identified as Acinetobacter,
and the patient was started on Zosyn, and his Flagyl was
discontinued.  On [**6-27**], the patient was taken to the
operating room for flexible bronchoscopy, thoracoscopy and
dressing change and incision and drainage of the patient's
empyema.  The operation went without complication.  Due to
the patient's wound still being infected, we were unable to
close it.  The patient's final intraoperative cultures grew
Acinetobacter.  The patient was continued on Zosyn and
started on Bactrim double strength.  His Levaquin and
________________ were discontinued because the patient has
not shown any fungal infection from his cultures thus far.

Continued dressing changes with Povidone iodine twice a day
with a whole roll of Kerlix fitting in the patient's cavity.
The patient remained afebrile, with vital signs stable.  The
patient ambulates well.

Because of the patient's cavity still being infected, unable
to close it at this point.  The decision was made to send the
patient home with dressing changes and antibiotics and
attempt closure at a later date.
