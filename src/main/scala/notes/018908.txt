History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58 year old male with severe cardiomyopathy (EF
~20%) who was seen in ED in [**Month (only) **] and treated for a pneumonia.  He
now presents with progressive symptoms including sinus pain,
cough, rhinorrhea, headache and mild shortness of breath.  He
describes his cough as productive of pink sputum.  He denies any
lower extremity edema.   The patient first presented to the ED
on [**2200-11-5**] and was evaluated in the emergency department and
found to have a RML pneumonia.  He was discharged with a Z-pack
but this was later changed to levofloxacin given concern for a
possible interaction with amiodarone.  He completed a 7 day
course of levofloxacin with great improvement in his symptoms.
Approximately six days prior to this presentation, he began to
have recurrence of his symptoms.  He took three days of
amoxicillin 500 mg, which he had left over from a previous
dental procedure. This has made him feel somewhat better. On
[**11-24**], he presented to his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] that time a repeat CXR
showed "probable partial resolution of a right-sided pneumonia."
  His symptoms continued to worsen over the next three days and
his PCP ultimately advised him to come to the emergency
department.
.
In the ED, vital signs were T 100.5, HR 69, BP 98/66, RR 20, O2
sat 97%. He received 500 mg levofloxacin and was admitted to the
floor.
