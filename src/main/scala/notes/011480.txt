History of Present Illness:
The patient reports being in usual state of health developing
daily hemoptysis in [**2168-6-19**]. He was subsequently found to
have NSCLC with metastases to the adrenals.He was admitted to
the MICU on [**2168-8-15**] and required angiography w/ embolization for
a lung parenchyma bleed.
He had a course of radiation therapy finishing on [**2168-9-6**] and 4
cycles of chemotherapy finishing on [**2168-12-1**]. He notes having
morning recurrent hemoptys in the for the last few month. 4 days
prior to presentation, he noted having dependent ankle swelling
associated productive cough, orthopnea and increased dyspnea. He
has slept in a chair on occasion. This am, during an outpatient
imaging appointment for his leg, he was noted to be dyspnic and
he was sent to the ED.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.1 118 161/81 28 89% on RA. Labs
were notable for a leukocytosis with bandemia of 9%, lactate 3.7
--> 3.1, and sodium 131. An 18g PIV was placed. He was given
vanc, cefepime, and levofloxacin. CXR and CT revealed a large
right pleural effusion. IP was contact[**Name (NI) **] and plan to do [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 576**]
today. VS prior to transfer: 100 111/74 12 99% 6L. He is DNR/I.

.
On the floor, he reports dyspnea associate with productive
cough, and he denies any fevers and chills, any chest pain,
nausea or palpitation.Denies any abdominal pain, diarrhea. He
notes 12 lbs weight lost in the last month.
The interventional pulmunology team placed a pigtail catheter
and drain 2 liters from the right lung cavity. The patient noted
improved breathing.

[**2-6**] CXR 1. Worsening perihilar opacities bilaterally, right
greater than left, and new lobulated nodular opacities within
the periphery of mid lung fields bilaterally. Findings are
concerning for progression of metastatic disease with possible
lymphadenopathy. Large right pleural effusion. No sizeable left
pleural effusion noted. Increased interstitial markings within
the right lung, which may reflect lymphangitic spread of tumor,
and less likely volume overload.

[**2-6**] CTA chest: 1. No acute pulmonary embolism or thoracic
aortic pathology. In this patient with known lung cancer, there
has been significant interval progression of metastatic disease
compared to the prior study.  Numerous pulmonary and pleural
based nodules, mediastinal lymph nodes and adrenal masses, have
increased in size. Extensive bilateral hilar consolidations.
While a component may be secondary to radiation change, the new
or increased consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes
are concerning for metastatic disease or possibly
infection. Moderate-to-large right and a small left pleural
effusions.

[**2-6**] CT Head: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses,
mass effect, or infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal
in size and configuration.  No fractures are identified. No soft
tissue swelling noted. The mastoid air cells and sinuses are
clear. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

[**2-7**] ECHO: There is a moderate to large sized pericardial
effusion. There is right atrial collapse. There is right
ventricular diastolic collapse.LV function is preserved with an
EF of >55%.

[**2-7**] LENI: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins demonstrate
normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation. Bilateral calf
veins showed normal flow. No evidence of DVT in veins of
bilateral lower extremities.

[**2-8**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is not
well seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a very small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
loculated. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Suboptimal image quality. Very small pericardial effusion
localized to the right atrial free wall. Hyperdynamic left
ventricular function. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Compared
with the prior report (images not able to be reviewed) of
[**2169-2-7**], the pericardial effusion is now only very small and
loculated adjacent to the right atrium.

Pleural Fluid cytology showed rare atypical epithelioid cells
with enlarged nuclei and prominent nucleoli, too few to
characterize.
and path showed predominantly inflammatory cells. The atypical
cells seen on ThinPrep are not seen.

Pericardial Fluid cytology showed predominantly blood with
lymphocytes, neutrophils, and few mesothelial cells. Negative
for malignant cells.


Brief Hospital Course:
62yo male with metastatic NSCLC s/p XRT and chemotherapy,
previous MICU admission [**7-/2168**] requiring embolization for lung
parenchymal bleed, recurrent hemoptysis, who presented with
increased ankle edema, productive cough, orthopnea, and dyspnea,
as well as worsening LLE pain.  Work-up revealed large right
pleural effusion, which was drained after pigtail cathete
