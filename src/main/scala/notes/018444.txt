sat continued to trend down to 94% on RA.  She was given 2L NC

tachycardia, and she received Aspirin 325mg, NTG SL 0.4 mg SL
and total of 6mg iv morphine.  Chest pain has now resolved.
.
Routine labs were drawn when pt complained of chest pain, and
her chem 7 showed an anion gap of 24 with glucose of 307.
Subsequent u/a showed trace ketones and glucose.  Lactate was
7.2.  She was given insulin, potassium and aggressive hydration.
 Over the course of 8 hours, pt's anion gap closed w/ initiation
of insulin drip and fluids - she was admitted to the ICU for
further management of DKA.  Of note, pt reports eating very
little in the past week due to hectic travel schedule and
feeling unwell.  She had the first big meal in several days
while in the ED at approximately 4pm.

Pertinent Results:
WBC = 7.8

Brief Hospital Course:
She was diagnosed with asthma exacerbation in the ED and had a
normal WBC and clear CXR without fever.  She was treated with
azithromycin, perdnisone, and albuterol nebulizer treatments.
Several hours after being given steroids she was found to have
hyperglycemia and a mild metabolic gap acidosis due to an
elevated lactate.  She was given IV fluids and started on an
insulin drip prior to admission to the ICU.  IN the ICU the
anion gap was felt to be due to the elevated lactic acid and the
hyperglycemia was felt to be iatrogenic due to the steroids.
The insulin drip was stopped and her AM fasting glucose was less
than 110.  She was no longer hypoxic in the AM with oxygen sats
of 98-99% on room air, and was discharged on a short course of
azithromycin, a ten day prednisone taper, and albuterol.  She
was asked to follow-up with her PCP to check her HbA1c.
