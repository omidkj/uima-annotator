2. Arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's Disease,
s/p surgery, radiation, splenectomy in [**2141**], CAD s/p PCI [**2165**],
HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, babesiosis w/ severe parasitemia [**4-5**]
presents with hemoptysis.  The has been having SOB over the last
week.  He went to see his PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**] and was started on
Flovent.  Last night the patient had worsening SOB and a "small
amount" of blood while coughing.  Today the SOB worsened and had
several more episodes of hemoptysis with a "cup full" this
afternoon that prompted him to go to the [**Location (un) 620**] ED.
.
In the ED at [**Location (un) 620**] 99.0 118 158/127 32 83% RA.  He was noted
to have blood in his OP and worsenign hemoptysis.  Labs were
significant for leukocytosis of 20.8, Hct 45.4, plts 457, INR:
1.1, CE negative x1.  He was given Cefepime/Vancomycin.  He was
intubated for airway protect and respiratory distress.  He was
given succinylcholine/etomidate and started on a propofol gtt.
Post-intubation CXR showed LUL consolidation and ETT tube in
proper position.  He had a CTA chest that showed L-sided
consolidation vs blood. No evidence of PE.  He was was paralyzed
for transport with vecuronium and 2mg of versed.
.
On arrive the patient was on Vt 450, FiO2: 100%, RR: 14, PEEP:
5.  He was noted to have blood in his ET tube and NG lavage was
performed that showed BRB that continued to be pink colored
after 1L.  His vent setting were changed to Vt 580, RR:18, FiO2:
100%, PEEP: 8 on arrival and ABG was 7.24/55/78/25 and rate was
increased to 20.  His foley catheter also showed blood. The
prelim CT read showed LUL consolidation that is likely blood.
There was also an area of constriction in the LLL that was
concerning for mass.  He also had a left pleural lesion and
small left effusion.

  Source: Stool.

   OVA + PARASITES (Final [**2173-11-1**]):
      NO OVA AND PARASITES SEEN.
      This test does not reliably detect Cryptosporidium,
Cyclospora or
      Microsporidium. While most cases of Giardia are detected
by routine
      O+P, the Giardia antigen test may enhance detection when
organisms
      are rare.
.
   CMV IgG ANTIBODY (Final [**2173-10-29**]):
      POSITIVE FOR CMV IgG ANTIBODY BY EIA.
      127 AU/ML.
      Reference Range:  Negative < 4 AU/ml, Positive >= 6 AU/ml.


   CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2173-10-29**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
      INTERPRETATION:  INFECTION AT UNDETERMINED TIME.
      A positive IgG result generally indicates past exposure.
      Infection with CMV once contracted remains latent and may
reactivate
      when immunity is compromised.
      If current infection is suspected, submit follow-up serum
in [**12-30**]
      weeks.
      Greatly elevated serum protein with IgG levels >[**2162**] mg/dl
may cause
      interference with CMV IgM results.

Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aort
