Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 84 yo M w/ h/o COPD on 2L home oxygen, cor
pulmonale with severe R sided diastolic dysfunction, dementia,
and R sided weakness s/p CVA who presents after recent admission
for syncope with altered mental status. Was admitted from rehab
recently on two occasions- from [**3-18**] to [**3-20**] for syncope in
setting of pseudomonal UTI and from [**2-22**] to [**2-25**] w/ hypotension
and bradycardia admitted to the ICU, ultimately diagnosed with
syncope of unclear etiology.
.
He was most recently discharged w/ a dx of vasovagal syncope
with a increase in his bowel regimen, decrease in his metoprolol
and plan for a two week course of ciprofloxacin for his
pan-sensitive pseudomonal UTI (he has h/o recurrent UTIs
including pseudomonal, proteus (R to cipro/bactrim/amp),
enterococcus (R to tetracycline), and klebsiella). His family
reports that he left the hospital in excellent shape but has
gradually deteriorated with weakness, lethargy and poor PO
intake. He has been continued on his 40 mg torsemide daily at
the rehab, anti-hypertensives, and supplemental potassium.
.
He was BIBA from the [**Hospital1 1501**] due to his altered state and due to
hypoxia- to the 80s on 2L, only improving the low 90s on
non-rebreather. He was also reportedly not behaving like
himself- sleeping more, needing additional help with feedings
and not oriented. Per records, torsemide was increased from 40
mg daily to 60 mg daily on [**3-26**]. Per family, baseline mental
status is oriented x2 with difficulties w/ memory for things
like phone number.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.6 100 127/91 24 95%
Non-Rebreather. BS was 100. Initial ABG was: 68 48 7.41. He was
transitioned to 6L NC, but tired out so was put back on NRB then
CPAP was started [**3-11**] tachypnea. Labs were notable for a lactate
of 4.3, Na of 158 (was 141 on [**3-20**]), Cr 3.9 (1.8), Cl 110, HC03
37, hct 53.8 (47.7), plt 112, BNP 17,220 (was [**Numeric Identifier 11377**] on [**3-18**]). CXR
was notable for mild pulmonary edema, but no infiltrate. Lactate
trended down to 2.4 with 1 L NS. He was also given vancomycin,
CTX and levofloxacin. VS on transfer were: BP 120/77 HR 84, RR15
on CPAP (24 on NRB); 93% O2 sat.
.
On [**Month/Day (4) 11419**] to the MICU, the patient is somnolent but arousable.
He denies any pain, difficulty breathing, or palpitations. When
asked why he is in the hospital he reports, "to get better."
.
