Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
Bacteremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right hip fracture revision


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 76 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, afib on antiarrthymics,
DM, CHF with ICD placement, with previous MRSA bacteremia
secondary to R hip septic arthritis treated with IV antibiotics,
s/p hemiarthroplasty with removal of hardware, presents to [**Hospital1 18**]
from [**Hospital 24356**] hospital for continued medical care and possible
surgical evaluation. The patient initially presented to [**Hospital 24356**]
hospital with a R hip fracture to which it was replaced in [**7-20**].
He subsequently acquired septic arthritis with MRSA, requiring
removal of the hardware and treatment with IV antibiotics. The
patient returned to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital 3 weeks later for
secondary revision of his right hip. However, prior to the
supposed surgery, the patient was found to have ?????? positive
bottles growing acinetobacter of undetermined source. ID was
consulted, and the patient was started on Unasyn. Throughout
this time, the patient has remained asymptomatic. At some point
during his stay there, the patient was switched to Vancomycin/
Zosyn. Moreover, questions were raised as to the possibility of
ICD seeding and further infection and bacteremia. Given these
concerns, and the need for hip revision, the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient was stable and in good
spirits. The patient denied pain of any kind. Additionally, the
patient denied fevers/chills, chest pain, SOB, n/v/d, abnormal
Bms, dysuria, hip pain, back pain or fatigue. Subsequent blood
cultures were negative.
.
ROS: As per HPI. Patient describes good PO intake and normal BMs

Micro:
Blood culture [**12-5**]: NGTD
Urine culture [**12-6**]: Mixed flora
.
Imaging:
Bilateral hip films [**12-5**]: There is a composite material femoral
prosthesis with a central metal rod in place.  Methyl
methacrylate is suspected, although depending on the age of the
prosthesis, coral has also been used for this purpose.  There is
bridging heterotopic ossification encircling the entire hip
joint.  There is no periprosthetic fracture.  Alignment is
anatomic.  The native acetabulum is present. LEFT HIP:  No
fracture or dislocation.  Normal alignment.
.
TTE [**12-6**]: The left and right atria are moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral,
basal inferoseptal and mid inferior walls. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.  The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo M with h/o CAD, CABG, CHF s/p ICD, afib, and R hip
fracture complicated by septic arthritis and removal of
hardware, presents from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with acetinobacter
bacteremia for continued medical care and possible surgery
evaluation.
.
MICU course: After surgical intervention on [**12-14**], the patient
was found to have hypotension and was unable to be weaned from
pressors.  The patient therefore was transferred to the MICU.
The patient was treated for hypotension with fluid boluses and
was quickly weaned off pressors (CVPs low prior to boluses).
After this the patient had few episodes of hypotension.  On [**12-15**]
hip films showed dislocation and two attempts were made to
reloacte it, unsuccessfully.  The patient had multiple epidoses
of rapid tachycardia (130s) after this as a result of pain that
self resolved.  The patient was treated with pain medications,
with mild effect.  The patient was then taken to the OR again
for surgical intervention on the right hip dislocation.  After
this the patient was returned to the MICU and was stable except
for episodes of agitation and tachycardia most closely related
to pain.
.
Bacteremia: Patient was admitted with history of recent septic
arthritis with MRSA, as well as positive blood culture for
acinetobacter from OSH.  Patient was admitted to OSH initially
for revision of R hip, however was found to have 1/4 bottles of
blood cultures positive for acinetobacter and was transferred
her for further workup and management.  Patient was initially on
Zosyn to treat this and ID was consulted for recommendations.
Clinically the patient had no signs of bacteremia with no
fever/leukocytosis. There were no localizing signs of infection.
 Blood cultures drawn here were negative.  Given patient's ICD
and possible bacteremia echo was obtained to look for signs of
endocarditis and was negative.  It was determined that blood
cultures at the OSH were drawn off of the patient's PICC.  The
picc was removed.  Blood cultures here were negative.
Antibiotics were discontinued and the pt remained afebrile with
normal wbc count.
.
Right Hip Repair: Patient had surgical repair of his hip in [**7-20**]
which was subsequently reversed due to septic arthritis.
Patient was transferred here for further evaluation. was taken
to OR initially for hip aspiration. was again taken to the OR 5
days later for open reduction. underwent removal of femoral stem
and a circlage wire for greater troch fracture was placed. he
was on coumadin and fondaparinux (HIT antibody +ve) for
anticoagulation. the pt had mild oozing from the R hip wound.
anticoagulation was held secondary to high INR. the oozing
decreased and finally stopped. the coumadin was restarted at a
dose of 3 mg hs. pain control was achieved with IV ketorolac and
dilaudeed.  He was started on vit d and ca given recent hip
fracture and would benefit from full BMD assessment with
subsequent management decisions (pending results) as an out
patient.
.
CHF/Cardiomyopathy: h/o CHF w/ EF of 25%. was not decompensated
during this admission. home lasix was held initially as pt was
hypotensive. was started on home dose of
