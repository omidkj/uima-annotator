Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
Patient initially presented with a creatinine of 5.2, prior
basline creatinine in [**Month (only) **] of 2.5. It was felt by renal that
this was due to ATN but the cause of ATN was undetermined. This
picture was further complicated by her chronic diabetic
nephropathy. Renal tried to avoid dialysis, however, the
patient's creatinine continued to rise and it became
increasingly difficult to control her electrolytes. It was
therefore decided by the patient and family to initiate dialysis
treatment. She received 3 dialysis treatments prior to her
discharge and did very well. She had no complications and
following dialysis, all symptoms improved. The day prior to her
discharge, a permanent AV fistula was placed by transplant
surgery. She will have dialysis on Mon, Wed, Fri.

2. CHF
She was continuously dosed c lasix 40 mg IV qd for hypoxia
initially. I&Os and weights qd were monitored. CXR and exam also
was c/w CHF. The patient had good urine output and responded to
lasix well. Over the course of several days, her CXR improved
and symptoms resolved. Has been on room air without any problems
since. [**Name2 (NI) **] lasix was discontinued as renal felt that it was
worsening her renal function prior to her dialysis. She remained
stable off the lasix and had fluid taken off of her as needed in
dialysis.

3. Left Lower Lobe Pneumonia
The patient was found to have an opacity in the left lower lobe
on CXR. She also had a left sided pleural effusion. This
remained stable throughout her admission but persistent. She was
placed on levofloxacin. An interventional pulmonary consult was
obtained to evaluate if an ultra-sound guided thoracentesis
would be possible, however, it was felt that this was too small
to tap.  A CT of the chest was therefore ordered which showed
pulmonary hypertension, a moderate left pleural effusion,
increased opacity within the basilar segements of LLL c parts
appearing to be atelectasis but inferior air bronchograms were
also present. There were also patchy areas of opacity within the
lingula and multiple vague <5mm nodular opacities within the
right middle lobe. There was also a small right pleural
effusion. Splenules were present s/p splenectomy. There was also
extensive colonic diverticula and a potential adenoma.  The
patient was discharged on antibiotics.

The adrenal adenoma will need further out-patient workup.

4. UTI
The patient had urine cultures which were postitive for
pseudomonas and enterococcus, pan-sensitive. She was already on
levofloxacin for pneumonia and was initially switched to
ciprofloxacin and augmentin.  The patient did well but her left
lower lobe opacity persisted. Therefore, the cipro was changed
back to levofloxacin. She remained on levo/augmentin. She did
well and repeat urine cultures were negative.

5. Leukocytosis
It was unclear the source of the patient's leukocytosis. She
remained afebrile but did have several potential causes,
including the UTI, LLL pna and s/p splenectomy.  The patient's
initial blood cultures were negative. She remained stable and
asymptomatic. She was therefore discharged with another set of
blood cultures drawn and will have labs followed closely at
rehab facility.

6. HTN
The patient was initially started on hydralazine as well as her
outpatient blood pressure medications while in the MICU.  She
complained of continued nausea and minimal vomiting. It was
noted that the nausea increased when her dose of hydralazine had
been increased. The hydralazine was therfore d/c'ed and
verapamil was started. The patient's nausea then resolved and
she had not further problems. She was maintained on verapamil,
Isosorbide dinitrite, and metoprolol without any complications
and maintained stable blood pressure throughout the rest of
hospital admission.

7. Diabetes
The patient initially had her hypoglycemic medications held in
light of her renal failure. She was placed on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] diet, ISS
and CBGs were checked qid.  It was then decided to start
Glipizide 2.5 mg qam. The patient did well and had stable blood
glucose levels throughout her hospital admission.

8. Hypothyroidism
The patient's TSH was initially high, however, her free T4 was
normal. It was felt that this will need to be re-addressed as an
out-patient in light of current illness. She was therefore
maintained on her outpatient Levoxyl without problems.

9. Hyponatremia
The patient initially was hyponatremic (115). Urine lytes, FENa
and other renal testing revealed that the patient likely had ATN
but unclear of cause.  This problem persisted and she was given
lasix to try to diurese her and fluid restrict her.  She
eventually was fluid restricted to <500 cc/d. She remained
asymptomatic and stable despite these low levels.  Upon
initiation of dialysis, the sodium slowly normalized and there
were no other complications. It was felt that the hyponatremia
was from her renal failure.

10. Groin pain
Upon transfer from the MICU to the floor, the patient complained
of b/l groin pain which then became pain only in the right groin
and hip. An x-ray of the right hip was normal except for some
osteoarthritis, but there were no fractures or dislocations. An
MRI of the hip was planned, however, the patient could not
tolerate the MRI despite the sedat
