Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: found down, right hip surgical wound infection, infected R
THR
Reason for [**First Name3 (LF) 12145**] transfer: sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
63 y/o female with past medical history of alcoholic cirrhosis,
hepatic encephalopathy, and multiple prosthetic joints treated
with vancomycin, then daptomycin, and finally suppressive
doxycycline for a MRSA infection of a L elbow ORIF and a R hip
PJI between [**2197-11-22**] and [**2198-1-23**] who presents from
[**Hospital6 33**] with concerns for sepsis and repeat right
hip surgical wound infection.
.
She was in her USOH up until when she was found down in her
apartment next to her wheelchair. It is unclear how long she was
down for, and the patient herself, is unable to give a history.
When she arrived to [**Hospital6 **] on [**5-3**], she was
hypotensive, hypothermic, hypoglycemic, and had presumed sepsis.

.
Her right lower extremity was noted to be internally rotated and
dislocated per the OSH orthopedic team. The area was frankly
infected, with pus coming out of incision. There was also
concern for infection and possible dislocation of the left upper
extremity. Orthopedics at the OSH recommended transfer to [**Hospital1 18**],
where her prior treatments have been. These include chronic
dislocation of R hip (s/p b/l THA), suspected septic non-[**Hospital1 **]
of L elbow ORIF, culture-negative; R hip PJI liner containment
with repeated dislocations.
.
At the OSH, patient was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
ID and orthopedics were following. She was not on pressors, but
was receiving bolus IVF. Her UOP was 20 cc/hour. Her respiratory
status is 50-70% on face tent with CXR showing bilateral
infiltrates. She was treated with vancomycin and imipenem prior
to transfer. Her microbiology data showed GPC and high PMNs on
right hip wound. She has no hardware in the LUE. Cr 1.1, Hct 31,
wbc 18, lactate 4.3. She is transferred for possible
washout/girdlestone.
.
Per discussion with next of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 102608**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 102609**]),
she is DNR/DNI.
.
To review her surgical history, on [**2-21**], she had fluoroscopically
guided aspiration of the R hip, with minimal fluid obtained.
This was sent for micro evaluation, but there was not enough to
send for cellularity. Fluoroscopically guided aspiration of the
L elbow on the same day was more productive, with fluid sent for
both micro and cellularity. This fluid had 625 WBC and 200,000
RBC.
.
On [**2-26**], she had operative revision of the head and liner of the
R hip, and was found to have a constrained liner. On [**3-1**], she
had washout of the L elbow ORIF with all hardware removed.
Although joint fluid from [**2-26**] demonstrated PMNs on Gram stain,
none of the other tissue or joint fluid samples demonstrated
either PMNs or organism on Gram stain, and all are
culture-negative to date.
.
On [**3-4**], patient was discharged from orthopedics service with
chief complaint of R hip dislocation and L elbow pain, with
discharge diagnoses of R hip aspiration, L elbow aspiration, R
THA revision (head and liner only), and L elbow removal of
hardware. She was discharged to [**Hospital3 1107**]
[**Hospital **] Hospital after chronic dislocation of R hip (s/p
b/l THA), suspected septic non-[**Hospital1 **] of L elbow ORIF,
culture-negative; R hip PJI liner containment with repeated
dislocations.
