Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Levaquin / Iodine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
RUQ pain, lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with sphincterotomy


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F presented to [**Hospital1 **] from nursing home with RUQ pain,
jaundice, and lethargy. She had a temp of 100.4 on presentation,
HR 118, BP 125/52. Her WBC count was 18.5 with 26% bands, alk
phos 328, total bili 5, creatinine 1.7. She had a RUQ US that
showed mild-mod. ascites and normal ducts. She was given
ceftriaxone 1g IV, metronidazole 500mg IV, and 1L NS. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible surgical and ERCP evaluation.

.
In the ED, her VS were T 102.2, HR 115, BP 130/83, RR 30, O2sat
95% 3L. Labs showed WBC 19 with 41% bands, Tbili 4.6, Cr 1.2,
lactate 5.4. She was started on the sepsis protocol after
discussion with son [**Name (NI) **] who confirmed DNR/DNI status and
consented to R subclavian TLC which was placed by the ED. RUQ US
showed ?mass in the gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid.
Surgery was consulted. CT abd/pelv performed 4h after US and
showed no visible gallbladder with fat stranding around the
liver and spleen, concerning for ruptured gallbladder. Surgery
felt that the patient is not a surgical candidate. She was
admitted to the MICU for management of sepsis. She was given
Vancomycin and Zosyn. Her lactate normalized. She remained HD
stable with volume resuscitation, no pressors were required.
ERCP removed stones and sludge.  Pt's lab values improved and
she was called out to floor.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia and occasional atrial ectopy. P-R

.
A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2157-10-16**] at 09:20 and
is compared with the prior radiograph of [**2157-10-13**]. A left-sided
PICC line has been placed. Its tip appears to overlie the
expected location of the proximal SVC. Persistent bilateral
pleural effusions, right greater than left, are not
significantly changed. Slight increase in the opacification of
the right hemithorax compared with the left likely represents
layering pleural effusion. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is
present although this is part exaggerated by the low inspiratory
effort. The right-sided bipolar pacemaker is in place.
IMPRESSION:
Allowing for technical changes and the relatively [**Name2 (NI) 68880**]
lungs, the findings are likely not significantly changed since
the prior radiograph, with persistent bilateral pleural
effusions, right greater than left. The left- sided PICC line
appears to have its tip projected over the expected location of
the proximal SVC.
.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Again
demonstrated is a moderate-sized right, and small left pleural
effusion, unchanged. Persistent compressive atelectasis is also
demonstrated within both lung bases. Coronary artery
calcifications are present.
There is increasing amount of fluid within the abdomen, now
moderate in extent. There has been interval development of
pneumobilia within the biliary system as well as air within the
gallbladder which is unusually positioned laterally, lateral to
the right lobe of the liver. The gallbladder otherwise is
collapsed and unremarkable. Portal vein is patent.
The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, and loops of
large and small bowel are unchanged from the prior exam and
unremarkable. Multiple mesenteric lymph nodes are present, all
of which are subcentimeter in size, and do not meet criteria for
pathologic enlargement. Both kidneys are mildly atrophic and
demonstrate multiple hypodensities within them consistent with
renal cysts, unchanged. There is no hydronephrosis, and both
kidneys enhance symmetrically. Abdominal aorta demonstrates
diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications, but is normal in
caliber. There is no free air. A VP shunt is demonstrated which
courses along the right lateral paracolic gutter in unchanged
position.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Foley catheter is
demonstrated within a collapsed bladder. Large amount of formed
stool is seen within the rectum. The pelvic loops of bowel
otherwise appear unremarkable. Moderate amount of free fluid is
demonstrated within the pelvis. The uterus and adnexa are within
normal limits. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions. The patient is status post right hip replacement.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval increase in free fluid within the abdomen, now
moderate in extent. This could represent ascites, however, given
the presence of a VP shunt catheter, CSF is not excluded and
clinical correlation is recommended.
2. Interval development of pneumobilia, status post ERCP. Air is
also demonstrated within an unusually laterally located
gallbladder. Gallbladder otherwise appears collapsed without
gallbladder wall thickening.
3. No focal fluid collections identified to suggest an abscess.
4. Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left, with compressive atelectasis.
.
Procedures: A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
A 12mm RX balloon was used to sweep the CHD and CBD with
successful extraction of all the stones along with pus and
sludge.
.
Impression: 1. A single periampullary diverticulum with a medium
sized opening was found at the major papilla.
2. Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with
a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Multiple oval
shaped stones, up to 10mm in diameter, were noted
