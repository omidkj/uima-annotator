PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Esophageal perforation.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Esophageal perforation.

OPERATIONS:
1. Left thoracotomy, repair of esophagus with intercostal
    muscle flap [**2150-12-29**].
2. Thoracentesis, right chest, [**2151-1-7**].
3. Bronchoscopy [**2151-1-12**].
4. Tracheostomy, bronchoalveolar lavage, open jejunostomy
    tube placement [**2151-1-13**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 87-year-old
female who presented to an outside hospital with fever and
abdominal pain. On CT scan, the patient was found to have
evidence of esophageal perforation. She was transferred to
our hospital for care.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient, upon arrival to the hospital,
had a left thoracotomy and repair of her esophagus. There was
seen to be a large size hole in the distal aspect of her
esophagus. Given the amount of necrosis and the amount of
fibrinous exudate and debris in the left chest, it was felt
that the perforation had occurred some time ago. The patient
had some debridement and buttressing of the esophageal repair
site with intercostal muscle flap.

The patient was sent to the intensive care unit. She had a
prolonged and difficult postoperative course. Attempts at
extubation were made several times; however, the patient was
unable to remain extubated for prolonged periods and required
reintubation each time.

X-rays and CT scans of the chest showed that the patient had
developing pleural effusions, especially on the right side.
The left side seemed to be fairly well evacuated with the
chest tubes which were in place. She needed a right
thoracentesis performed on [**2151-1-7**] under ultrasound
guidance. This returned a fair amount of serosanguineous
fluid. A bronchoscopy performed approximately 5 days later
showed that the patient had significant copious secretions,
and it was thought that she would not be a good candidate for
extubation. Given the copious secretions and the numerous
failed extubations previously, the patient underwent a
tracheostomy and open jejunostomy tube on [**2151-1-13**].

The patient's pleural fluid on several occasions grew out
Enterococcus. Eventually, the speciation came back as
vancomycin resistant enterococcus. The patient's white count
had risen to 34,000 and remained elevated for several days.
Upon beginning linezolid, however, the patient's white count
began to decrease. Approximately 10 days after the linezolid
was begun, the white count went down to normal.

The patient had a continued difficult postoperative course.
She continued to have copious secretions from her
tracheostomy site and required suctioning several times a
day. Her cultures intermittently grew enterococcus but her
white count did stay down with the antibiotic regimen that
she was on.

Eventually, the patient had all other systems resolved except
for her kidneys. She stopped making any urine and had
increasingly rising creatinine. The patient had been on
intermittent and continuous hemodialysis. After discussion
with the family, it was thought that the patient would need
lifetime dialysis for supplementation of her kidneys. Given
the fact that the patient had requested not to be on chronic
support such as chronic dialysis, and after discussion with
the family, it was decided to withdraw support. Support was
withdrawn, and the patient expired approximately 48 hours
thereafter. The family was present at the bedside for this.
