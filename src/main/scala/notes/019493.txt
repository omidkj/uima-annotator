Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of HTN, Type II
DM, and Paget dz who presents with chest pain for two days.
Difficulty obtaining history directly from patient, as patient's
hearing aide was not functioning when she arrived in the ICU.
Per report and the patient's family, patient was complaining of
pleuritic right-sided chest pain for the past two days at rehab.
 Today, she was transferred from rehab to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation
of both her chest pain and for monitoring her urine output in
the setting of newly diagnosed bladder mass.  She did not have
any other symptoms.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.2  109/55  HR 92  RR 14  100%.
 A chest PA and lateral was obtained with evidence of RLL.  The
patient was going to be admitted to the floor, but developed a
fever to 103.9.  Blood and urine cultures obtained.  Patient
also had episode of SVT (? a. fib) with RVR and received
diltiazem 30 mg PO x 1 and 10 mg IV x 1.  She also received
levofloxacin.  She was then admitted to the ICU given concern
for SVT and septic physiology.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient's hearing aide was not
working, and she could not provide a history.  Her family was at
the bedside, and corroborated the above history.
.
The family reports the patient has declined since a recent
admission for complicated UTI.  She was discharged to rehab,
evaluated by urology/urogyn, and reportedly has a "bladder mass"
which requires a foley catheter to avoid obstruction.  The
patient had the catheter removed 5 days ago.  She has just
completed a treatment course of metronidazole for (+) C. diff.
.
Review of systems:
Per family, did not have any other symptoms apart from pleuritic
right-sided chest pain.

[**2192-7-20**]:  TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The cardiac, mediastinal and
hilar contours are stable. Note is made of a tortuous aorta with
atherosclerotic calcification.  Lung volumes are low and there
is a right lower lobe posterior opacity. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions. Note is made of bibasilar
subsegmental atelectasis.

IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe opacity, worrisome for pneumonia.
Recommend clinical correlation as pulmonary infarct is also in
the differential. If  clinical picture is compatible with
pneumonia, recommend follow-up chest radiograph in [**3-13**] weeks to
document resolution.

[**7-21**]:
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient with right lower
lobe pneumonia.  Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with
comparison to [**2192-7-20**] radiograph.

There is significant interval worsening of right lower lobe
consolidation, findings that are most likely consistent with
interval aspiration given the rapidity of the change. Pulmonary
hemorrhage would be another possibility if the patient has
clinical condition pre-disposing to that. Right pleural effusion
is noted, new.

[**7-22**]
There is interval improvement of the right basal consolidation,
most likely consistent with partial resolution or aspiration.
Still present left basal opacity as well as mild vascular
engorgement is seen and there is bilateral pleural effusion,
small to moderate. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of Type II DM, HTN, Paget
disease presents with 2 days of pleuritic chest pain with
radiograph consistent with pneumonia.
.
# HCAP- must consider pneumonia health care associated, as
patient was transferred from long-term care facility.  RLL
locale consistent with recent aspiration event.  Patient has
minimal O2 requirement, but is hypoxic, likely [**1-10**] V/Q mismatch
in setting of infiltrate and possible atelectasis.  Must also
consider VTE given tachycardia, hypoxia, and pleuritic chest
pain.  Given more likely diagnosis of pneumonia, modified [**Doctor Last Name 3012**]
criteria is 4, which suggests deferring CTA chest.  Patient was
covered broadly for HCAP with vanc, cefepime, and levoflox with
intent to complete 10 day course given lack of sputum sample.
Legionella antigen was negative.  Patient received intermittent
IVF boluses to maintain MAP > 65.  She was placed on aspiration
precautions, and oxygen was weaned as tolerated.  Patient's code
status was confirmed DNR/DNI with HCP.  [**Name (NI) **] had persistent
hypotension despite multiple boluses of IVF, and family meeting
was held on [**2192-7-23**].  [**Name (NI) **] HCP and family wished to pursue
transition from IVF and antibiotics to comfort measures only
after additional family members visited with patient on [**2192-7-24**].
 Palliative care was involved and following discussion with
family we decided to pursue comfort measures on [**7-25**].  IV
antibiotics and fluids were withdrawn.  Ms [**Known lastname 23**] was
comfortable, non-verbal at time of discharge.  She was
discharged to [**Hospital3 **] facility with goals of comfort
care with PO morphine for discomfort and pain.
.
# Right-sided hemiparesis- Per PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 228**] baseline SBP
generally much higher than admission SBP.  Patient noted to have
RUE paresis day after admission, with suspected CVA and
watershed infarct.  Discussed with family, who declined further
imaging evaluation.
.
#FEN: Following family meeting, HCP and family decided not to
pursue nasogastric tube or PEG tube for nutrition.
