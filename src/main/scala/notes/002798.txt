Service:  MED ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known firstname 18404**] is a 70 year old
female with a past medical history of high cholesterol,
mitral valve prolapse, and recent history of falls and
unsteady gait.  The patient's husband describes approximately
two to three months of ill health with symptoms mainly
consisting of some dyspnea on exertion, breathing trouble,
non-specific weakness and several falls.  Today, Miss [**Known lastname **]
fell while on the toilet.  The patient denies loss of
consciousness.  Family reports loss of consciousness.  The
patient was brought to the Emergency Room at an outside
hospital where she was alert and oriented times three and in
respiratory distress.  She was treated for congestive heart
failure and transferred to [**Hospital1 188**].

Here in the Emergency Room, she was tachypneic and
hypertensive, and arterial blood gas revealed ventilatory
failure for which she was intubated.  In the Emergency
Department, CT scan of the head revealed a question of left
frontal early ischemic lesion.  Neurology was consulted.  The
patient was treated with additional Lasix and triaged to
Medical Intensive Care Unit.

1.  Mitral valve prolapse.
2.  Right carotid stenosis.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Question of hypertension.
5.  Breast CA, question Tamoxifen.
6.  History of unsteady falls.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Zocor 10 mg p.o. q. day.

ALLERGIES:  Tamoxifen leads to a rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**State 531**], is married,
and was in the [**Location (un) 86**] area visiting family.  No tobacco.
Son, whose name is [**Name (NI) **], has a phone number of [**Telephone/Fax (1) 37492**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 98.1 F.;
heart rate 60 to 70; blood pressure 120/90; respiratory rate,
intubated.  Generally, intubated and sedated.  Pupils equally
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Face was
symmetrical.  Neck was supple; increased jugular venous
distention to approximately 8 to 9 cm.  Lungs with bibasilar
crackles.  Cardiac regular with II/VI at left lower sternal
border.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive
bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Warm with good pulses, positive
edema.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 6,800,
hematocrit of 42.8, platelets 199,000.  Sodium 134, potassium
5.4, chloride 99, CO2 of 32, BUN 26, creatinine 1.1, glucose
105, ALT 188, AST 239, LDH 2137.

Urinalysis was nitrite positive, positive white blood cells,
positive bacteria.

CPK went from 138 to 252.  Arterial blood gas revealed gas of
7.17/103/107.

EKG was normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, large P wave in II,
T's decreased in III, AVF and V2 through V5.

Chest [**Known lastname 37493**]:  Moderate congestive heart failure, no
infiltrates.

CT scan of the head showed negative bleed, question left
frontal cortex, hypodense, question edema and infarction.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 70 year old
female with question of neurological history who presents
status post syncope with respiratory distress requiring
intubation, intermittent hypertension and evidence of
congestive heart failure.  EKG and head CT scan was
suggestive of ischemic process of the brain.  Also,
urinalysis is suggestive of urinary tract infection.

The patient had a right arterial line placed as well as right
internal jugular catheter centrally placed.  This was done
without complications.  On [**11-25**], the day of admission, the
patient was started on Nitroprusside GGT for unstable
systolic blood pressure.  The patient was continued on a
Propofol drip, Lopressor, Zocor, Levaquin for urinalysis and
Zantac for GI prophylaxis.

The patient was not aggressively diuresed.  Chest [**Known lastname 37493**] was
revealing of only mild congestive heart failure with oxygen
saturations stable.  The patient underwent cardiac
echocardiogram on [**11-25**], which showed positive left
ventricular hypertrophy.  No thrombus was seen and ejection
fraction estimated at 45% with apical lateral hypokinesis.

The patient had an episode in the evening of [**11-25**] to [**11-26**],
of bloody gastric drainage and was started on Protonix 40 mg
p.o. twice a day and subcutaneous heparin was discontinued in
favor of Venodyne.  The patient's neurologic examination at
this time:  The patient squeezes with left hand only and
wiggles left toes only.  The patient opens eyes to command.
An MRI/MRA performed on [**11-26**], showed hemorrhage into the
left frontal infarction with midline shift; no significant
carotid stenosis was seen and right frontal area of apparent
hemorrhage, the patient's carotids appeared normal on MRA.

The patient had a transesophageal echocardiogram on [**11-27**],
which showed left atrium normal in size.  No mass or thrombus
was seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.  No
mass or thrombus was seen in the right atrium or right atrial
appendage.  No ASD or patent foramen ovale was seen by 2D
color Doppler or saline contrast maneuvers.  Moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy; left ventricle cavity
is unusually small.  Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic with ejection fraction greater than 75%.  The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.  Aortic
leaflets appear structurally normal; no aortic regurgitation.
Small pericardial effusion.  No vegetations or thrombi were
identified compared to trans-thoracic study of [**11-25**].  Right
ventricular function was probably also depressed in the prior
study but the right ventricular free wall was less well seen
in the prior study.

The patient had a head CT scan done on [**2149-11-28**], which
showed two areas of hemorrhage:  The first was located in the
left frontal lobe in the region of the infarction first seen
on [**11-25**].  The size of the hemorrhage and extensive
surrounding edema and mass effect is unchanged from the MRI
of [**11-26**].  The left lateral ventricle is mildly
compressed and shifted to the right.  There is no
hydrocephalus.

A second area of hemorrhage is seen as a small 3 mm
hyperdense region, high in the sulcus of the parietal lobe.
Bone windows show fluid levels within the sphenoid sinus;
these are unchanged from MRI of [**11-26**].  No fractures
were identified.

On [**12-1**], the patient self extubated thought to be secondary
to a respiratory muscle weakness and shallow breaths with
respiratory rate into the fifties and delta MF.  The patient
was reintubated and put on assist control.

The patient's blood pressure was labile throughout her
Intensive Care Unit stay.  The patient would have episodes of
blood pressure 200 to 100 which would resolve either
spontaneously or with Lopressor.  She would then drop down to
the 90s systolic.  Lability of the blood pressure stabilized
throughout her Intensive Care Unit stay.  The patient was put
on Atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q. day and blood pressure ranged at
the end of the MICU stay was from 110 to 170 systolic.  The
patient had no readily appreciated changes in mental status
during these episodes.

Neurology recommended an MR of the cervical spine which was
done on [**2149-12-5**], showed no evidence of cord compression or
neural impingement.  Cord signal is normal.  The etiology of
the patient's failure for extubation was thought to be
possibly centrally mediated.  The patient had a tracheostomy
placed on [**2149-12-3**], without complications.  A PEG tube was
successfully placed on [**12-4**], using standard techniques.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy at the time showed normal EGD
to the stomach.  The patient was started on tube feeds and
tolerated them well.

The patient's sedation was weaned off and the patient was
alert and responsive to questions and commands.  The patient
had a CT scan of the chest on [**2149-12-5**], to assess for
possible primary pulmonary process, and to assess for
previous needs for intubation and prolonged ventilation.
This study revealed no gross evidence of interstitial lu
