History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 73819**] is an 82 y/o M with PMH of CAD admitted following
a fall at home on [**7-11**]. Per admit notes, the patient was
reaching for something in the cabinet when he fell from standing

brought to [**Hospital3 **] where he was intubated (airway
protection) and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management; CT scan demonstrated L acute SDH with 10 mm shift.
GCS prior to intubation was [**1-3**].  In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he received
mannitol, dilantin, and fentanyl for sedation; he was
transferred to the TSICU.

[**2159-7-11**] CT C-SPINE: 1. No fracture or acute alignment
abnormality.
2. Intralobular septal thickening most consistent with volume
overload.

[**2159-7-11**] NON-contrast HEAD CT: 1) Extensive subdural blood with
subfalcine and possible uncal herniation as described.
2) Limited evaluation without priors, though dilatation of the
right lateral ventricle is suggested and continued monitoring is
recommended to exclude worsening hydrocephalus.
3) Equivocal small interpeduncular fossa blood may represent a
subarachnoid component to the hemorrhage though no other
subarachnoid blood is seen.

[**2159-7-13**]  NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Compared to prior CT there is no
significant change.  Again identified is a large subdural
hematoma along left convexity with a maximum thickness of
approximately 1.1 cm. There is also blood seen along the left
side of the falx as well as above the tentorium cerebelli.
Extent of sulcal effacement along the hemispheric subdural
hematoma is not significantly changed. Small amount of subdural
blood along the right frontal region is also unchanged. The
remainder of the exam is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Compared to prior CT from [**2159-7-12**], there is no
significant change.

[**2159-7-20**] NON CONTRAST HEAD CT: 1. Status post craniotomy and
evacuation of a left subdural hematoma. Persistent subdural
blood along the falx and tentorium. Approximately 6 mm of
subfalcine herniation.
2. New left parietotemporal extensive hypodensity may represent
postoperative edema however infarct, likely subacute cannot be
excluded.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: This is a subacute infarction in
the territory of the inferior division of the left MCA. There is
a tiny amount of hemorrahge in the occipital hornof the left
lateral ventricle. There is
left hemispheric mass effect due to swelling of the infarction.

[**2159-7-21**] CTA HEAD: Status post evacuation of left subdural
hematoma. Evolution of the left middle cerebral artery
infarction with increasing local mass effect. Dense
calcifications of the vertebral arteries and cavernous carotid
arteries. Probable stenosis at the vertebral basilar injunction.
 Two millimeter anterior communicating artery aneurysm.

[**2159-7-11**] CXR: Nasogastric tube and endotracheal tubes in adequate
position. No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.

[**2159-7-16**] CXR portable: Mild pulmonary edema and moderate
bilateral pleural effusion have increased since [**7-15**]. Heart
size is top normal, unchanged. ET tube, nasogastric tube, and a
right central venous line in standard placements. No
pneumothorax.

[**2159-7-23**] CXR portable: Endotracheal tube terminates about 5.5 cm
above the carina.
