Pertinent Results:
[**10-10**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with added focalities inn inferior and septal walls with mildly
preserved function in the anterior and lateral walls. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
20 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results on [**2152-10-10**] at 8:30AM. POST-BYPASS: For
the post-bypass study, the patient was receiving vasoactive
infusions including epinephrine at 0.03mcg/kg/min and
phenylephrine at 0.7 mcg/kg/min. Normal Right ventricular
function. LVEF 20%. There is a prosthesis (ring)in the mitral
position. It is stable and functioning well. There is no
stenosis or regurgitation across the mitral valve. Intact
thoracic aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4643**] was transferred from OSH after cardiac cath revealed
left main and multi-vessel disease. As well as echo showing 3+
mitral regurgitation. Upon admission he was appropriately
medically managed and worked-up for surgery. On [**10-10**] he was
brought to the operating room where he underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 4 and mitral valve repair. Please see
operative report for surgical detail. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive management in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one his
chest tubes were removed. All drips were weaned off on post-op
day one and on post-op day two he was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further care. Beta blockers and diuretics
were initiated and he was gently diuresed towards his pre-op
weight. On post-op day three his epicardial pacing wires were
removed. The remainder of his postoperative course was
essentially uneventful. He was transfused a total of 2 units
PRBCs postoperatively for anemia. He continued to progress and
on POD#5 was discharged to home with VNA. He was instructed on
all necessary follow up appointments.
