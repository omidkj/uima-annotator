EGD RESULTS:
Impression: Erythema, congestion and friability in the stomach
body and fundus compatible with severe portal gastropathy
Gastric varices
Evidence of prior esophageal banding.
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus, four bands were
successfully placed in the lower third of the esophagus.
Polyp in the pylorus
.
IMAGING:
CXR:
Prominence of the hilar structures bilaterally, could be related
to fluid overload or lymph nodes. Recommend PA and lateral views
and if old films could be obtained for comparison, this would be
most useful.
Radiopaque density projecting over right rib, one probably a
bone island or granuloma. Localization not possible on a single
view. CT scan could be helpful.
.
ABDOMEN U.S.; DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL
1) Portal veins, hepatic veins, and hepatic arteries are patent
with appropriate flow and Doppler waveforms.
2) Coarsened, nodular liver likely consistent with the history
of cirrhosis; no focal lesions seen.
3) Splenomegaly.
4) Small right pleural effusion
.
EKG: sinus tach without acute ST-T changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) GI bleed: Sources of bleeding included peptic ulcers and
varices, both of which may have been exacerbated by his recent
EtOH use.  Underwent EGD and had 4 bands placed in the distal
esophagus for esophageal varices.  During his stay the patient
received a total of 5 u PRBC, 6 units plt, 2 u FFP.  He was kept
on an octreotide gtt for 5 days and was continued protonix 40 mg
PO BID throughout his hospitalization.  He was kept on SBP
prophylaxis with levofloxacin during his hospitalization.  At
discharge patient had not had any bleeding in 1 week, BM's
returned to [**Location 213**].  Will follow up for Upper GI endoscopy in 1
week and f/u GI appt in 2 weeks.  Discharged on 40 mg Protonix
daily.
.
2) Cirrhosis/portal hypertension: Likely secondary to EtOH.
Abdominal U/S showed no evidence of portal/hepatic thrombosis or
ascites.  Hepatitis workup negative except for mildly positive
[**Doctor First Name **] and mildly positive anti smooth muscle antibody and evidence
of past Hep A immunization or infection, and Hep B immunization.
 (See results section for complete list of labs).  Patient was
discharged on nadolol and previous diuretics were not restarted.

.
3) EtOH abuse: Patient had an addictions consult during his
hospitalization and was kept on a CIWA scale.  Pt was given
thiamine and folate.
.
6) F/E/N: Patient was slowly advanced to a house diet.
Electolytes were monitored and maintained K>4 and Mg>2.  At
discharge patient was tolerating full diet without difficulty.

.
7) For prophylaxis patient was given pneumoboots and kept on a
PPI.
