History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year old ex-smoker and ex-IVDU with severe COPD and
multiple COPD exacerbations with respiratory failure requiring
intubation, as well as evidence of right hemidiaphragm
dysfunction and tracheal stenosis s/p tracheal stent in [**8-16**]. He
was in his USOH at his rehab facility, went to [**Hospital **] clinic
yesterday for cryo of granulation tissue on the superior edge of
the tracheostomy, at which point he became acutely
bronchospastic, desatting to low-mid 80's (from low 90's). He
was given several nebulizer treatments and the trach was
replaced. They suctioned up a little blood. Per IP, the feeling
was that he likely became bronchospastic in the setting of some
chemical irritation from mild bleeding. With some supplemental
O2, his sats came back up. They contemplated giving him some
solumedrol prior to sending him home, but felt that his clinical
status had improved. Today, at rehab, he became very distressed
and hypoxic once again, and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, his trach was adjusted and he was placed on the vent,
and his respiratory distress greatly improved. He then
transiently became hypotensive to the 80's from the 110's. He
was unhooked from the vent temporarily out of concern for
auto-peep, but this did not make any difference to his
pressures. He received a small NS bolus, and his next blood
pressure was back up to the 100's. He also received steroids and
antibiotics prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was complaining mainly of
back pain and was requesting dilaudid. He also complained of
shortness of breath, and felt that he wasn't able to get a good
breath in from the vent. Between times of stimulus, he fell
asleep and looked much more comfortable, but was also not
drawing frequent enough breaths, so he was switched to MMV. He
noted that his right leg was more erythematous than it usually
is, but denied pain.

3) Diabetes mellitus type 2.

nasal swab
10) PUD hx of ulcers (gastric/duodenal)
11) chronic right hemidiaphragm elevation - phrenic n.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 52 y/o M with severe COPD on home O2 s/p trach,
tracheomalacia s/p tracheal stent then dilatation, and right
phrenic nerve dysfunction presented with acute respiratory
distress.
.
# Respiratory Failure: The patient presented to the ED after
increased respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient had had
an IP procedure the previous day and likely had some mild
chemical irritation from blood inhalation and manipulation of
his tracheostomy, resulting in easily triggered bronchospasm.
Though he responded then to nebulizers, suction of little blood,
and O2, he continued to experience respiratory distress the next
day, and was taken to the ED. He has very little reserve so it
is likely that very small disruptions can initiate an
exacerbation.
   Please see HPI for details of his course in the ED. After
transfer to the floor, the patient occasionally complained of
shortness of breath. He was continued on MMV, which was
appropriate given his periods of apnea (likely due to his pain
meds.) The patient had a significant level of anxiety, and
constantly requested IV Dilaudid for back pain. There was a
concern for auto-peep given the effect of anxiety on his
breathing rate/depth, thus anxiety medications were provided as
needed. During his stay, no infectious etiology was found for
his exacerbation. He was treated initially with IV steroids for
COPD exacerbation, and transitioned to PO Prednisone prior to
discharge. He was maintained on scheduled nebs, and received
Azithromycin in the ED, but it was discontinued early after an
infectious trigger was ruled out.  The pt was weaned off the
vent with no complications, and was oxygenating well (baseline
90s, occasional upper 80s) via 2L nasal cannula and tracheostomy
mask on day of discharge. He has not been difficult to arouse
throughout his hospitalization.
  He will need to follow-up in 1 week with his PCP to determine
the appropriate Prednisone taper given his hx of frequent COPD
exacerbations. His PCP will also adjust his Furosemide dose as
needed.
.
# Cellulitis: The patient presented with a patch of
erythema/edema on his right lower extremity which he described
as chronic, and usually more edematous. There is evidence of
stasis. The erythema is worse per the patient, and has been
treated for MRSA cellulitis in the past. During his stay, an
additional patch appeared on his left lower extremity, though
less erythematous and edematous in comparison. The patient was
initiated on Vancomycin 1g IV q12 x 7 days (last day = [**8-9**]) for
presumed MRSA celluitis, given his history. On day of discharge,
the edema and erythema had improved, and the lower extremities
were only mildly tender to palpation. The patient has a PICC
line in place. He will be completing the course at rehab. There
may also be a component of venous stasis to his lower extremity
changes. He was re-started on Furosemide 20mg PO bid, to be
adjusted by his PCP as
