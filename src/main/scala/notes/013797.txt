HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46 year old
male with a history of alcoholic and hepatitis C cirrhosis
that has been complicated in the past by a variceal bleed
last year, status post TIPS procedure, who was transferred
from [**Hospital6 **] where he was initially admitted on
[**2143-10-17**], after being found down at home by his mother.  At
that time, the patient was found to have a hematocrit of 23.0
with platelet count of 69,000 and a creatinine of 4.3, well
above his baseline thought to be secondary to acute tubular
necrosis.  He was started on Dopamine and Octreotide.  He had
an initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy that did not show an
active bleed, but follow-up endoscopy showed grade II varices
and oozing portal hypertensive gastropathy.  He ultimately
received a total of eight units of packed red blood cells,
twelve units of platelets and four units of fresh frozen
plasma.  He was intubated for airway protection at his second
scope and transferred intubated on [**2143-10-28**], in part out of
the possibility for liver transplant candidacy.  He was
initially transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit.
While he was there, he spiked a fever to 101.6.  Of note, he
had been on Gatifloxacin at the outside hospital for about
ten days for pneumonia that was found on chest film on
[**2143-10-19**].  He had a repeat AP film here on [**2143-10-28**], that
showed a left lower lobe collapse and consolidation.  He was
initially started on Levaquin but soon changed to Ceftazidime
and Vancomycin and the respiratory culture soon grew out
Staphylococcus aureus with sensitivities pending.  Of note,
the patient had a liver ultrasound with Doppler that showed a
patent TIPS with normal flow direction and increase in
ascites.  He had a paracentesis while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with a
total of 40cc of fluid for diagnosis that was not suggestive
of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.  The patient self
extubated on the day of transfer from the Intensive Care Unit
without any further complications.  The patient was unable to
provide any further history of the initial events but was
able to whisper yes or no to basic questions.  He denies pain
and dyspnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cirrhosis secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C diagnosed
four years ago with cirrhosis.  He had been held off the

vehicle accident two years ago.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former marketing consultant
for a designing firm.  He has been unemployed for several
years.  He has a history of alcohol abuse.  He lives at home
by himself.  His primary social supports are his mother who
lives several miles away.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial examination in the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**]
Intensive Care Unit, temperature was 97.9, heart rate 82,
blood pressure 124/60, oxygen saturation 100% on AC with a
tidal volume of 700, PEEP 5, FIO2 100%.  In general, he was
comfortable without jaundice.  His pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  Oropharynx
examination, he had moist mucous membranes with dried blood
around his mouth.  Nasogastric tube in place.  He had
inspiratory wheezes, left greater than right with decreased
breath sounds at the bases.  Cardiac examination - He had
regular rate and rhythm, without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen was distended and protuberant, nontender to
palpation with active bowel sounds.  On extremity
examination, he had 3+ pitting edema with significant scrotal
edema.  Skin examination had no petechiae although he had a
superficial erosion on his back.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
9.1, hematocrit 31.7, platelet count 253,000.  His Chem7 was
notable for blood urea nitrogen of 23 and creatinine of 1.3.
His AST was 79, ALT was 58, his bilirubin was 8.0.  Albumin
was 2.2 with an alkaline phosphatase of 128.  He had a
urinalysis that showed [**4-4**] red blood cells, 5 white blood
cells, occasional bacteria.  Urine lytes had less than 10
sodium with a few osoms of 543.  He had a partial
thromboplastin time of 45.4, INR 2.7.  Ascites analysis
included a white blood cell count of 275 with 82% polys, 45%
lymphocytes with 450 red cells, albumin less than 1.0, total
protein 0.3.  The microscopic of that peritoneal fluid on
transfer from the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit was negative for
bacteria or fungi.

He had a chest film that showed as mentioned above with
marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and left lobar
collapse and consolidation of the left lower lobe and small
left pleural effusion.  He had a liver ultrasound that showed
patent TIPS and appropriate hepatopetal flow.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He had liver ultrasound that did not
indicate TIPS stenosis that could explain worsening hepatic
failure which would have been a more simple explanation for
his decompensation.  He had Chem10, coagulation studies
monitored throughout his hospital course.  He was seen by the
liver transplant team in preparation to liver transplant. He
was seen by the Social Worker and team who worked with him
during his hospitalization.  He was initially treated with
lactulose, Neomycin and Propranolol and the diuretics were
soon held when his creatinine continued to rise during his
hospitalization here.  His Lactulose was titrated to three to
four bowel movements a day.  His encephalopathy was slow to
improve but ultimately did improve.  The patient became quite
clear during the latter part of his hospitalization.  His
Neomycin which was initially as part of his encephalopathy
regimen was discontinued with no adverse effect on his mental
status.  His Propranolol was kept throughout his
hospitalization.  The patient was kept off his diuretics
until his renal function returned to baseline at which point
they were slowly reinitiated.  Unfortunately, his renal
function continued to decline afterwards at which point they
were taken off once again.  His volume status continued to
worsen over the duration of his hospitalization when his
diuretics were removed and he gained well over fifteen pounds
in fluid.  The patient became clear enough that the
nasogastric tube was able to be removed and he was able to
take his p.o. Lactulose and other oral medications.  The
patient had low grade fevers and occasional abdominal pain.
This led to several attempts at tapping him.  One attempt was
successful under ultrasound guidance that showed perineal
fluid that was not consistent with peritonitis.  Once the
patient cleared, started diuretics only to have them stopped
soon after due to renal failure.  He was started on 25 grams
of Albumin twice a day in an effort to increase his
intravascular volume and improve his urine output. At the
time of this dictation, his current regimen includes
Lactulose, Propranolol and the 25 grams of Albumin twice a
day.  He has been relisted on the Liver Transplant Progr
