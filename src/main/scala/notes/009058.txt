History of Present Illness:
This is an 82yo female with known coronary artery disease s/p
CABGx3 in [**2159**]. Recently she had an episode of congestive heart
failure and subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterzation
revealing a patent internal mammary but occluded vein grafts.
She was first noted to have mitral and tricuspid disease in
Septmember [**2170**] when an echocardiogram was notable for moderate
to severe mitral regurgitation and moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation. A repeat transesophageal echocardiogram [**2171-9-10**]
showed severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. She is
symptomatic with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion however she
does maintain her daily activities without any hindrance. Given
the severity of her disease, she was referred for surgical
consultation.

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT [**10-31**]: 1. Thoracic aortic calcifications, most
prominent in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
These images are available for review for preoperative planning.
2. Status post previous coronary bypass surgery with diffuse
calcification of the native coronary arteries. 3. Cardiomegaly.
4. Mild interstitial lung abnormality with basilar predominance.
Such findings can sometimes be observed in the elderly
population in the absence of symptoms or pulmonary function
abnormalities, but the appearance overlaps with nonspecific
interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). 5. Single enlarged mediastinal
lymph node is of uncertain clinical significance.
.
Carotid U/S [**10-31**]: Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA 40-59%
stenosis.
.
TTE [**2171-11-1**]: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The left atrium is elongated. The coronary sinus is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
annulus diameter is 4.3 mm. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of
surgery.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is V paced. The patient is on
epinephrine and milrinone infusions. Left ventricular function
is mildly depressed (EF 50-55%). There is mild hypokinesis of
the mid inferior wall. Right ventricular function is mildly
depressed. There is a well-seated mitral annuloplasty ring in
place. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a mean gradient
of 4 mmHg across the mitral valve at a blood pressure of 125/63.
There is a well-seated tricuspid annuloplasty ring in place.
Mild (1+) tricuspid regurgitation is seen. No tricuspid stenosis
is seen. The aorta is intact post-decannulation.
.
CXR [**11-4**]: Small right pleural effusion. Stable pulmonary edema
and
cardiomegaly. Possible left 7th rib fracture which could be
better seen on
dedicated rib radiographs.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**10-31**] (day before
surgery) since she was on Coumadin and admitted for Heparin and
pre-op work-up. She was brought to the operating room on
[**2171-11-1**] where the patient underwent Redo sternotomy and mitral
valve repair with a 26-mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] Annuloplasty band and
tricuspid valve repair with the 28-mm Contour 3-D Annuloplasty
ring. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable
on no inotropic or vasopressor support. Beta blocker was
initiated and titrated up. The patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight. CXR showed pulmonary edema and
Lasix was subsequently increased. She
