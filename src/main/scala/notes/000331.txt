stenosis. Selective angiography of the renal arteries showed a
50% stenosis of the left and a 20-30% stenosis of the right
renal artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo F with HTN, PAF, h/o CVA, mild RAS, CAD s/p drug-eluding
stent of LAD on [**7-5**] now with increasing Cr post procedure and
episode of AFlutter.
.
1. CAD s/p drug-eluding stent to LAD. Currently chest pain free.
Initial bump in CK-MB post procedure now trending down. Will
continue to follow. groin site with bruit but no hematoma or
ooze. evaluated with femoral ultrasound which was negative.
.
2. Rhythm. h/o PAF with Aflutter noted on tele. Awaiting EP
consult. Restarted on Coumadin. Goal INR 1.5-2.0. Continue
Amiodarone. d/c digoxin
.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency likely secondary to dye
load from cath. Baseline Cr unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] diurectic and ACEI for
now and continue to monitor Cr. Worsening renal function most
likely from contrast nephropathy. Hydrated and monitored for
fluid overload treated with lasix. Had echocardiogram on [**7-6**]
which revealed....
.
4. DM. Continue on outpt regimen of Glyburide with ISS.
.
5. HTN. Continue outpt regimen of Amlodipine and Metoprolol with
hydralazine while holding ACEI and diuretic.
.
6. Hyperlipidemia. Continue statin.
.
7. PPX. Ranitidine, INR 1.4 on coumadin

Because of her abdomenal pain, Surgery was consulted.  A CT of
the abdomen was obtained showing marked thickening of the right
colon and proximal transverse colon indicating grangrenous
bowel.  A decision was made to take the patient immediately to
the operating room for an exploratory laporotomy.
Intra-operatively, the patient was found to have ischemic bowel
with gangrene and a right colectomy was performed.  She
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the surgical
intensive care unit.  The she was intubated and sedated and
closely monitorred by both the ICU team and the primary team, as
well as other consulting services to optimize her recovery.  She
slowly recovered over the course of a few days and was
extubated.  She soon became strong enough to be transferred to
the surgical floor were she began to tolerate regular meals,
pass flatus, and have good urine output.  She also started to
work with the physical therapist to regain he straingth.
Eventually, she was able to be close to her baseline and was in
a good enough condition to be discharged home with services.
