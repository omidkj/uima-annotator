History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of prior small bowel resection
and repair of a
femoral hernia who presented with 24 hours of nausea, vomiting
and abdominal pain with distention. The patient was evaluated by
her outside hospital physician who sent her to the emergency
department. In the emergency department, she was found to be
significantly distended with diffuse
abdominal tenderness and cramping. Her white count was 22,000
with a lactate of 2.7. An abdominal CT scan was consistent with
bowel obstruction with proximal small bowel dilatation, distal
decompression. Based on these findings, the decision was made to
take her to the operating room for laparotomy.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: s/p ex lap/ SOB low saturation

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
s/p ex lap
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p ex lap/ SOB low saturation
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Decreased saturations.

Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2118-7-7**].

The NG tube was removed in the meantime interval.

There is worsening of bilateral perihilar opacities suggesting
worsening of pulmonary edema.

In addition, there is a significant increase in bilateral
pleural effusion. The heart size is mildly enlarged but
unchanged and there is also no change in the appearance of the
mediastinum.

IMPRESSION: Worsening pulmonary edema accompanied by increased
pleural effusions. These findings were communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
during the time of dictation.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Surgery Service and taken to the
operating room for an exploratory laparotomy and lysis of
adhesions. There were no intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively she did have episodes of decreased oxygen
saturations requiring supplemental oxygen. Her chest xray did
show some evidence of pulmonary edema and she was given IV
Lasix. Her oxygen was eventually weaned off and she is
saturating well.

A Speech and Swallow evaluation was also done because of concern
for aspiration; there was evidence of aspiration with thin
liquids. It is being recommended that she have thickened liquids
and that her medications be crushed and given in applesauce or
yogurt.

A Rheumatology consult was placed during her hospital stay
because of an elevated sed rate. In reviewing her paper work
from her previous rehab stay it appears that this was not a [**Last Name **]
problem associated with this hospitalization and that  a
Rheumatology consult was initiated. She does have a history of
osteoarthritis but no history of PMR. It is recommended that she
follow up with the Rheumatologist at rehab for further workup of
this problem.

Physical therapy was consulted and has recommended that she go
to a rehab facility after hospital discharge.
