Placement of pacemaker


History of Present Illness:
86 YO male presented to [**Hospital3 934**] ED in complete heart
block. He was at adult day care on the day of admission when
staff checked his vital signs around 12:00 noon and found him to
have a heart rate in the 30s. His daughter was called and picked
up the patient and took him to his PCP where [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 12 lead EKG
revealed him to be in complete heart block. He has had decreased
energy for several weeks and has been less active. Per his
daughter, he is pleasantly confused at baseline and was at his
baseline mental status on presentation to the ED and upon
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. He denies chest pain, SOB, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, syncope, lightheadeness. He does endorse mild
abdominal pain but denies any diarrhea or other [**Hospital1 **] symptoms.
.
At the [**Hospital **] Hospital ED, his VS were T 97.4, P 39, RR 16, BP
184/67, O2 sat 98% 02 on 3 L NC. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
temporary transcutaneous pacemaker placement due to complete
heart block with wide ventricular escape at 35 bpm. A temporary
transcutaneous pacer was advanced to the RV apex via fluroscopic
guidance and position was confirmed with fluorscopy. V threshold
was set at 0.8 mA and V sensitivity threshold at >20 ms. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 78612**]s: VVI 70, V output 10 mA, V sensitivity 3 mV.

STUDY: CT of the head without contrast. [**2153-6-8**]
There is a large area of encephalomalacia involving the left
occipital lobe, vascular territory of the left posterior
cerebral artery, multiple areas of low attenuation in the
periventricular white matter, indicating chronic microvascular
ischemic disease, there is no evidence of acute hemorrhagic
changes or shifting of the normally medial structures. Punctate
dense atherosclerotic calcifications are visualized in the left
medial cerebral artery, carotid siphons, and vertebral body
basilar systems. Prominence of the sulci and ventricles is also
noted, likely age related and involutional in nature. Prominence
of the tip of the basilar artery is also noted, the possibility
of arteriosclerotic changes versus aneurysmatic formation are
considerations, CTA of the head is recommended if clinically
warranted. The orbits appear grossly normal, the paranasal
sinuses demonstrate normal pneumatization, as well as the
mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: Chronic ischemic changes are visualized on the left
occipital
lobe with associated encephalomalacia and asymmetry of the left
occipital
ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. Multiple areas of low attenuation are
demonstrated in the periventricular white matter, likely
consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes. There is
no evidence of acute hemorrhage or subdural hematoma. Dense
arteriosclerotic calcifications are demonstrated in the carotid
siphons, left medial cerebral artery, and vertebrobasilar system
as described above. Prominent tip of the basilar artery is
demonstrated, possibly related with arteriosclerotic changes, a
small aneurysm cannot be completely excluded, CTA or MRA are
recommended for further characterization of these findings.
These findings were communicated to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the time
of this interpretation.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2153-6-10**]
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is related to age-related
parenchymal atrophy. Periventricular white matter
hypoattenuation is consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.  There is again calcification of the middle cerebral
arteries, carotid siphons,
and vertebrobasilar arterial system. There is no hemorrhage,
edema, mass
effect, or shift of normally midline structures. There is ex
vacuo dilatation of the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral
ventricle with surrounding encephalomalacia, consistent with
prior infarction.
CTA HEAD: There is prominence at the tip of the basilar artery,
which may
represent a patulous basilar artery or a small aneurysm. Poor
arterial
opacification and lack of processed imaging limits evaluation.
When processed images are become available, a separated addendum
will be provided.
IMPRESSION:
1. Prominence of tip of basilar artery may represent patulous
basilar artery versus small aneurysm. Poor arterial
opacification and lack of processed image limits evaluation, but
an addendum will be generated.
2. Calcifications of the intracranial vessels.
3. Age-related parenchymal atrophy.
4. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
5. Encephalomalacia of the left occipital lobe, likely from
prior infarction.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation. Mildly dilated thoracic
aorta.
