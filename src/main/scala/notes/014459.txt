CXR:
[**2194-6-22**]: There is background COPD. The patient is status post
sternotomy and placement of prosthetic valve, with cardiomegaly
and a relatively transverse orientation of the heart. There is
bibasilar patchy opacity -- this most likely represents
atelectasis, though small pneumonic consolidation would be
difficult to exclude. There are small bilateral effusions and/or
pleural thickening. No CHF. A focal rounded area of relative
lucency is seen along the right heart border in the
cardiophrenic region -- this likely represents artifact due to
surrounding opacity, but attention to this area on followup
films is recommended.

Compared with [**2194-6-19**] at 5:48 a.m. and allowing for technical
differences, there has been possible minimal improvement at the
left base and slight interval decrease in the degree of upper
zone redistribution. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval
change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8389**] was taken to the operating room on [**2194-6-16**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for cervical tracheal resection and reconstruction,
flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, and
sternothyroid muscle flap buttress. He was transferred to the
ICU intubated on pressors. Pressors were weaned off overnight.
POD 1 he was started on Lasix which continued until [**2194-6-19**],
when he was able to extubate. Bedside bronchoscopy was done
prior to extubation for thick secretions. He transferred to the
floor [**2194-6-20**]. Below is a systems review of his hospital course:

Pulm: After extubation he continued use of incentive spirometry
with nebulizers.
He was able to mobilize secretions. He remained afebrile without
WBC count on the floor. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed in
the OR on [**2194-6-23**] revealing patent airway and intact
anastomosis. Guard suture was removed.  Home oxygen 2 Liters, he
titrated down to 1.5 L with oxygen saturations of 96-97%.

CV: He remained in  rate controlled atrial fibrillation 70-80's.
Hemodynamically stable 120-140.

GI/nutrition: The patient failed initial swallow evaluation
[**2194-6-20**] and remained NPO. Repeat swallow on [**2194-6-23**]. He was
started on a soft solid, thickened puree diet. Small frequent
meals. Medications, Small pills swallowed whole with applesauce,
larger pills crushed in applesauce or split in half. Home
medications were resumed once taking PO's. Aggressive bowel
regime with good results.

GU: His [**Known lastname 8389**] was placed after surgery, DC'ed [**2194-6-20**] and
replaced that day due to urinary retention. Flomax was started.
His [**Known lastname 8389**] was DC'ed [**2194-6-24**] midnight flomax was increased to [**Hospital1 **]
he voided.

Renal: renal function within normal limits. Home diuretics were
continued with good urine output.  Electrolytes were replete as
needed.

Endo: Insulin sliding scale with blood sugars to maintain blood
sugars < 150

Heme: Coumadin 4mg resumed [**2194-6-23**] without bridge.  INR [**2194-6-24**]
1.3 for Goal INR 2.0-2.5 for chronic atrial fibrillation.

Pain: well control with IV Dilaudid transition to PO oxycodone.
Brief episodes of anxiety responded well to his home dose of prn
lorazepam.

Disposition: He was followed by physical therapy who recommended
rehab.  He continued to make steady progress and was discharged
to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 701**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 109992**] on XXX. He will
return [**2194-7-9**] for flexible bronchoscopy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
