Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 14837**] was taken to the operating room on [**2183-1-3**]
where she underwent right thoractomy and tracheoplasty by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for tracheobronchomalacia. She was kept intubated
and went to the ICU following surgery due to airway edema. She
was diuresed with lasix and on neosynephrine drip for
hypotension. She was given a dose of stress dose steroids
intraoperatively. The patient was extubated on [**2183-1-5**], and
remained on neosynephrine drip in the ICU, which was titrated
off on [**2183-1-7**].
The patient was transferred to the floor on the evening of
[**2183-1-7**], with acceptable blood pressures, in normal sinus
rhythm. The following is a systems review of the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course.

Neuro/Pain:
The patient was kept on bupivicaine with dilaudid epidural which
was removed on [**2183-1-7**], and started on oxycodone with tylenol
which was effective.

Pulmonary:
Aggressive pulmonary toilet was maintained throughout admission
with around the clock nebulizers, mucolytics and chest
physiotherapy. Serial chest xrays were taken daily. The patient
exhibited signs of increased volume overload on [**2183-1-8**],
therefore was aggressively diuresed with IV lasix. Subsequent
films improved. She was unable to wean completely off oxygen.
She was discharged with 2Liters NC, with TID mucomyst and
albuterol nebulizers.

CV: The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm with blood
pressures in the 100-120 range systolic, on the floor.

Abd: The patient advanced her diet to regular diabetic diet. She
was kept on stool softeners, passing gas.

Renal: Her foley was kept initially during epidural but then for
urine output monitoring. It was discontinued [**2183-1-9**]. A UA was
checked due to bump in white count which was positive. Bactrim
was started [**2183-1-10**].
She was aggressively diuresed for volume overload with IV lasix.
Her electrolytes were repleted.

Endocrine: Her insulin pump was discontinued preoperatively.
Postoperatively she remained on insulin drip then SQ long
acting, managed by [**Last Name (un) **] endocrinology. On [**2183-1-8**] the
patient's insulin pump was restarted with normal blood sugars.

Prophylactic: SCD's, TEDS and heparin SQ were given for VTE
prophylaxis.

The patient was seen by physical therapy who deemed her safe for
discharge home with home PT. The patient was discharged home on
[**2183-1-11**].
