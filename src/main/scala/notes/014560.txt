History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 yo female with h/o DVT/PE, h/o necrotizing
fasciitis, COPD, recent cholecystectomy c/b biloma/sepsis
requiring ERCP and stone retrieval with stent placement.  She is
being transferred from [**Hospital3 **]1d s/p retrieval of
biliary stent with fevers, hypotension, and abdominal pain, and
vomiting.

She had a recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 62161**]
following a cholecystectomy at OSH for acute cholecystitis due
to the development of biliary leak/biloma, fevers, and
hypotension.  She was treated with antibiotics, IR drainage of
the biloma, ERCP with stone removal and stent placement. She
fared well and completed 10d of cipro/flagyl as an outpatient
completed on [**2104-6-28**].

Of note, since the patient has been at rehab facility, the
patient developed a PE after acutely complaining of shortness of
breath. She was evaluated at [**Hospital3 107616**] and reportedly
was found to have a PE on CTA of the chest. The patient was
started on coumadin and Lovenox shots. The patient has not been
taking Coumadin since Friday per her daugther's report in light
of procedure at [**Hospital1 18**] on Friday prior to presentation.

She had this biliary stent removed Friday prior to presentation
at [**Hospital1 18**]. She was eating and feeling well after the stent
removal on Friday. On Saturday, the patient was noted to have a
fever of 101.6 with chills as well as poor appetite. She denies
belly pain on Saturday AM. In the evening on Saturday, the
patient was noted to have another fever of 102 associated with
shaking as well as tachycardia of 100-130. She reports an
episode of bilious vomiting (non-bloody) and nausea as well. She
denies abdominal pain at the time. Of note, the patient reports
an episode of burning, right-sided chest pain associated with
shortness of breath that spontaneously came on and then
resolved. There was no radiation of the chest discomfort. She
denies further episodes of chest discomfort.

She was then taken to the OSH ED for further evaluation. She
presented to OSH ED, where note was made of an elevated troponin
?I to 0.43 without CP or EKG changes, and she was transferred
here for hypotension and further management in light of recent
procedure.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department, her initial vitals
were 98.2 110 86/57 16.  Leukocytosis to 12.6, lactate to 2.6,
hyponatremia and mild transaminitis were noted.  A right IJ
triple lumen was placed due to sepsis (well-placed on CXR), and
vancomycin and ceftriaxone were empirically administered for
septic shock. Norepinephrin gtt started.  She has remained
hypotensive with SBP 80-90 for roughly 3 hours.  2L NS were
administered and SBP increased to 80. Lowest recorded SBP in the
ED 79 per verbal sign out from ED resident. CXR without
pneumonia but mild pulmonary edema. Attempted to upload CT
images from OSH but was not an optimal study, so the patient
underwent a CT scan prior to transfer to the MICU.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient deniest abdominal pain,
nausea, and vomiting since arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

CT OF THE CHEST:  The thyroid gland is normal.  There is no
axillary lymphadenopathy.  There is a right lower paratracheal
lymph node measuring 12 mm (series 2, image 17).  There is no
hilar lymphadenopathy.  There are mild-to-moderate
atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta and

effusion.

The airways are patent to a segmental level. Centrilobular and

are seen, predominantly at t
