Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
S/P Cardiac arrest

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79067**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a 64 yo male with a h/o morbid obesity, OSA, and
HTN who presents following a witnessed cardiac arrest.  Patient
does not recall the events preceding his admission to [**Hospital1 18**], and
history was obtained from OSH record and from wife.  [**Name (NI) **] report,
patient was at a wedding ceremony  He was in a seated position
when his wife heard a gurgling [**Last Name (un) **] and noted him to collapse
onto the ground.  There were medical personnel present and CPR
reported him to have a carotid pulse. EMS arrived and reported
him to be in ventricular fibrillation.  He was shocked x 1 at
200J and was returned to a perfusing rhythm.  No rhythm strips
are available.  Per report, a piece of chewing gum was suctioned
from the oropharynx during resuscitation.  There was no report
of urinary or fecal incontinence.
.
He was subsequently brought to the ED at [**Hospital 7188**] Hospital where
he was intubated. Per report, this was a "difficult intubation."
He was reported to be hemodynamically stable at time of arrival.
 CT head was reported as normal. He was admitted to the CCU and
supported overnight on a ventilator.  He was started on a
heparin gtt and amiodarone gtt at 0.5 mg/min.  he received ASA
325 mg and Lidocaine 100 mg IV.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  His family did endorse
episodes of dyspnea with exertion and diaphoresis.
.

LABORATORY DATA (from OSH):

RADIOLOGY:
CXR ([**2107-9-11**]): cardiomegaly; left pleural effusion; mild
pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema;
tortuosity and narrowing of trachea noted

[**2107-9-13**] Carotid Ultrasound
Less than 40% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries
bilaterally. This is a baseline examination at the [**Hospital1 18**].

[**2107-9-13**] Thyroid ultrasound
1. Normal thyroid ultrasound.
2. Mass seen on recent CT not identified due to its retrosternal
location.
This could be further evaluated with non-contrast enhanced CT or
MRI.

[**2107-9-14**] ECHO
Pre Bypass: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal for the
patient's body size. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mild septal and mid inferior
hypokinesis..The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Post Bypass: Preserved biventricular function. LVEF 50-55%.
Inferior wall motion slightly improved. Aortic contours intact.
Remaining exam unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons
at the time of the exam.

[**2107-9-11**] CTA Chest
1. Superior mediastinal 3 cm mass, immediately contiguous with
the inferior aspect of the thyroid gland. Further evaluation
with thyroid son[**Name (NI) 867**] is recommended as clinically indicated.
The nodule is substernal and may be difficult to visualize
[**Name (NI) 79068**], however.
2. Intermediate attenuation 4.6 cm bulging along the contour of
the right
subscapularis muscle. Differential diagnosis would include a
mass such as a myxoma or elastofibroma or a cystic structure
such as a paralabral cyst or bursitis. As clinically indicated,
further evaluation with shoulder MRI is recommended.
3. Extensive coronary artery calcifications.
4. Tiny pulmonary nodules measuring 4 mm at the right lower lobe
adjacent to the major fissure and 3 mm in subpleural location
overlying the left lower lobe.

[**2107-9-12**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

revealed two-vessel coronary disease.  The LMCA has no
angiographically-apparent stenoses.  The LAD has a proximal,
hazy,
ulcerated 80% stenosis and a calcified 50% mid-vessel st
