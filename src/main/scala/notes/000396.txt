Chief Complaint:
dizziness, vomiting, hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
62yo F w/ a PMH of afib, CAD, and CHF (diastolic dysfunction)
now admitted with nausea and dizziness in the setting of afib w/
RVR. Pt states that she first had symptoms of dizziness [**1-21**]
weeks ago in the setting of what she thought was a cold. She
took Sudafed for several days and the symptoms seemed to
improve. Her cold then seemed to settle into her chest, with a
sore throat predominating. She had 24hrs of diarrhea but then
felt well up until last night. During dinner last night, she
began to feel dizzy again. She describes her dizziness as a
sensation of a "heaviness" in her head. She denies any spinning
sensation, of either herself or the room. She denies any vision
changes. She states that she came home from dinner and went to
bed, but then got up in the middle of the night and had
difficulty walking to the bathroom and had to hold on to the
walls as she walked. She then decided to come to the ER for
further evaluation.
.
The dizziness is associated with a mild headache and nausea.
She's had emesis or more specifically, dry heaves x2. She denies
any presyncope, LH, falls or LOC. She denies any URI sx,
including cough, rhinorrhea or sinus tenderness. She denies any
SOB, CP or palpitations. She has had minimal PO's since the
start of these sx, but previously denied any weight loss, night
sweats, diarrhea. No urinary sx. No leg swelling, numbness,
tingling or weakness in her arms or legs.
.
In the ER, VS were T 97.5, BP 236/106, HR 120-130s, RR 16, sats
of 99% on RA.

Studies:
CT Head with contrast:
There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline
structures or hydrocephalus.  Tiny hypodensity is seen in the
right centrum semiovale, unchanged from the prior study,
consistent with microangiopathic change.  No air- fluid levels
are seen in the paranasal sinuses. The mastoid air cells are
clear. The soft tissues appear unremarkable.
.
EKG: Baseline artifact. Regular supraventricular rhythm. There
is a late
transition which is probably normal. Compared to the prior
tracing regular
supraventricular tachycardia is now present.
.
MRI/A Brain: Multiple T2 and FLAIR hyperintense signals seen in
the periventricular and subcortical white matter, consistent
with chronic
microangiopathic changes.  No evidence of acute hemorrhage or
stroke.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 62 y.o. female with PMHx of A fib, s/p cardioversion, HTN,
CHF who presents with complaints of N/V and dizziness in the
setting of a. fib with RVR and hypertensive urgency.
.
# Nausea/Dizziness: Initial differential included vertigo, acute
MI, posterior CVA, labrynthitis with recent URI. ACS ruled out
by CEs x 2, 12 hours apart and has no ischemic changes on EKG,
making MI less likely. Posterior CVA assessed by MRI/MRA without
evidence of thrombosis or new CVA.  Patient was followed by
neurology during stay and gave input concerning symptom
management.  On the third day of admission, symptoms had
completely resolved, which is consistent with vertigo associated
with labrynthitis following her recent URI.  Upon discharge
denies any further symptoms of nausea, vomiting or vertigo.
.
# HTN: Poorly controlled upon arrival to the ED at 236/106. OMR
notes demonstrate BP range of 120s-150s, though given 3
antihypertensive agents, suspected that patient likely has
chronically elevated blood pressure. Cause of acute elevation
was unclear, but likely related to poorly tolerating po
medications. Patient does report compliance with her medications
prior to hospitalization. Acute cardiac event was ruled out as
detailed above. Initially on ICU admit BP was being controlled
on Labetalol gtt. She denied HA and UA shows no evidence of
end-organ damage. Labetalol gtt was discontinued and she was
briefly hypotensive to low 100s. She continued to have labile
BP, with averages to 170s but had much improvement with addition
of home lasix dosing.  Electrophysiology was consulted
concerning her afib despite prior cardioconversion and suggested
adding verapamil 80mg [**Hospital1 **].  This medication was only given once
while inpatient as she persistently had heart rates in the
mid-60s.  She was not discharged on this medication, but sent
home on her prior antihypertensive medications with a VNA to
visit and perform BP checks.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: S/P cardioversion in [**Month (only) 205**] on admit found
to be in atrial fibrillation again. Patient denied chest pain or
palpitations on presentation which might suggest asymptomatic a.
fib, thus making it difficult to tell if she has been in sinus
since her conversion. Underlying etiologies include
hyperthyroidism or infection. TSH suppressed, not hyperthyroid
on labs. Patient is afebrile now with no signs of infection, but
had a recent URI. Again, MI has been ruled out as above.  HR
labile the evening of admit with swings from HR 120s to 65s
indicative of possible Afib vs autonomic dysfuntion. EP
consulted and thought she likely had atrial tachycardia and
recommended verapamil, maximum dosing of carvediol/lisinopril
and lasix.  Verapamil held as above.  Discharged with
instruction to decrease [**Month (only) 197**] dosing for next three days,
given elevated INR of 3.6.  Should follow-up with [**Hospital 197**]
Clinic next week for INR check and dose adjustment.
.
# CAD: History of two vessel CAD with no intervention. Admitted
on ASA, BB and statin at outpatient dosing. No evidence of MI on
admit. Continue all outpatient meds.
.
# CHF: Preserved EF with LVH and elevated left-sided filling
pressures on echo in [**2173**] with overall greater evidence of
diastolic dysfunction, compared to previous echo in [**2169**].
Patient is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] as an outpatient and took Lasix
PRN. On admit was hypovolemic given recent nausea and vomiting.
