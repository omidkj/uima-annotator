Pertinent Results:
[**2128-12-11**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant system revealed no obstructive CAD.  The LAD, LMCA,
RCA, and LCx were free of angiographically appartent stenoses.
2. Central aortic pressure was low with an SBP of 70 mmHg and
DBP of 30 mmHg. 3. Successful placement of an intra-aortic
counterpulsation balloon via the left femoral artery with
position confirmation by floroscopy.  The position was
stabilized by multiple subcutaneous suture anchors prior to
transport.  Adequate augmentation noted on the balloon pump
console.
[**2128-12-11**] Echo: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending,
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. A mass
or vegetation on the mitral valve cannot be excluded. Torn
mitral chordae are present. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. There is no
pericardial effusion. POST-CPB: Sinus Tach on Epi,Levo drips. 1.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position. No MR.
[**Name13 (STitle) **] paravalvular leak. 2. LVOT obstruction is mild with strut of
St [**Name13 (STitle) 923**] valve present in the outflow tract with mild turbulent
flow seen. 3. Hyperdynamic LV systolic function. Normal RV
systolic function. 4. Mild to Moderate (2+) TR unchanged from
pre-CPB. 5. Bilateral pleural effusions are diminshed post
Bypass.
[**2128-12-16**] Chest/Abd CT: 1. Multifocal pneumonia. 2. Status post
median sternotomy with a pericardial drain and a small amount of
intrapericardial gas, but no pericardial effusion. 3. Edema in
the subcutaneous soft tissues of the abdomen and pelvis. 4.
Uterine fibroids.
[**2128-12-16**] UE U/S: Superficial vein thromboses of the right
basilic and cephalic vein. Please note that the right subclavian
is not viewed in its entirety secondary to the patient's central
line; however the vein distal to the line is patent. No evidence
for deep vein thrombosis within the visualized deep venous
structures.
[**2128-12-22**] Abd U/S: 1) No gallstones, or evidence of
cholecystitis.
[**2128-12-27**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system revealed no angiographically apparent disease.
The LMCA, LAD, and LCx were all patent. The RCA was not
injected. 2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated filling
pressures with a mean RA of 19mmHg and a mean PCWP of 24mmHg. 3.
The procedure was complicated by dislodgement of the RIJ venous
sheath and temporary pacing wire during patient transfer. A
second temporary pacing wire placed via the left femoral vein
and the original pacemaker was removed.
[**2127-12-31**] UE U/S: Right internal jugular acute appearing
nonocclusive thrombus. Right cephalic occlusive thrombus. Left
axillary chronic nonocclusive thrombus.
[**2128-1-5**] CXR: The patient is status post median sternotomy.
Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged from previous study.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, but slightly
improved from previous study. There is also slightly better
aeration of the lung bases on current study. Pulmonary
vasculature is within normal limits.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted from ER to cath [**Year/Month/Day **], hypotensive on significant
pressors. Echo showed acute flail mitral valve leaflet seen with
? papillary muscle rupture and ? vegetation. Cardiology consult
done and pt had cath which showed clean coronaries/IABP inserted
for wide open MR. [**First Name (Titles) 9042**] [**Last Name (Titles) 9043**] to OR where she underwent a
MVR done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] in the early AM [**12-11**]. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Transferred to the CSRU
in critical condition for invasive monitoring. Renal consulted
for acute renal failure with ? cortical necrosis of her kidneys
due to shock. Also had shock liver with very high LFT's post-op
that slowly trended back to normal by discharge. CVVH started
and her chest was opened at bedside after she developed high
airway pressures, low C.O. and difficult ventilation that
afternoon on [**12-11**]. IABP removed that evening. Steroids were
started for concern for septic shock and stopped on post-op day
4. She remained stable over the next couple of days and her
chest was re-closed on [**12-14**] in the OR. All cultures were
negative and abx discontinued on POD #4. Amiodarone was started
for atrial fibrillation and her chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed over the next couple of days. Heparin
was started for DVT prophylaxis. All drips were weaned and she
was started on beta blockers. On post op day six she was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Over
the next week her WBC remained elevated. ID was consulted and
multiple cultures were taken. Cultures were negative and she
remained afebrile. WBC trended down and no ABX were started. On
post-op day 12
