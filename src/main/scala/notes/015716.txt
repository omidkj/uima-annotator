PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 61 yo M with h/o alcoholic cardiomyopathy (EF
15%), EtOH abuse, CKD, DM II, and afib not on anticoagulation
[**12-31**] falls who presents s/p fall with AMS, hypoxia, and
hypotension requiring intubation and pressors. Per ED report,
the pt fell on [**5-12**] with head trauma and ? LOC. He then called
EMS on [**5-14**] as he felt "unwell" and was found in bed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
He was brought to the ED, he was hypotensive and a femoral CVL
was placed. Pressors were started and he was transferred to the
MICU. He was started on Abx to cover aspiration PNA on [**5-14**]. He
was found to have a C2 dens fracture in the ED and was placed in
a C-collar. Ortho spine was consulted who recommended placement
of a HALO. He was intubated on [**5-15**] for hypoxemic respiratory
failure and subsequently had a trach placed on [**5-17**] due to his
dens fracture and need for long-term ventilation with the HALO
in place. Pressors were weaned off on [**5-16**]. He was continued on
CTX/Levaquin/Flagyl to cover aspiration PNA. CTX was discontined
on [**5-19**] and he was continued on [**Last Name (un) **]/Flagyl for coverage. His
oxygen requirement decreased and he was placed on transtracheal
oxygen on [**5-19**].

He was called out to the medical floor on [**5-21**]. On questioning,
pt denies any pain. He is unable to speak due to trach in place,
but is able to mouth words.

Past Medical History:
1)EtoH abuse
- no h/o variceal bleeds, no h/o cirrhosis
- no h/o DTs or withdrawal seizures

Social History:
Pt lives alone in an apartment in [**Location (un) 86**]. He has no close family
or friends nearby. [**Name2 (NI) **] is a retired assistant for food and
beverages at [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. He worked there for 10-11 years
but then retired and worked part time. He eventually left that
when his cardiomyopathy became more symptomatic and he is
currently on SSDI for this. He has a long smoking history (>30
pack years) but does not smoke now. He drinks 4 drinks (unable
to quantify how much in each drink) about 4 times per week. This
is the most that he states he has ever drunk. He denies any
history of DTs, seizures, or withdrawal but does mention a
history of hallucinations during withdrawal in the past. No
other drug use.


Family History:
F died of Parkinson's and pneumonia in his 80s. M died of
Alzheimer's and CAD in her 80s. Mother and MGM both had a

Imaging:
CXR [**5-19**]: Feeding tube terminates below the diaphragm with the
tip not included on the radiograph. A left PICC line has changed
in position, with the tip now directed cephalad at level of the
azygos vein contour. This may either be entering the azygous
vein or it may be directed superiorly within the right
brachiocephalic vein. This finding has been communicated by
telephone to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 108957**] on [**2164-5-19**]. The exam is otherwise
remarkable for slight worsening of pulmonary edema with
otherwise no substantial change since the recent study.

TTE [**5-15**]:
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1914**]. RA mod dilated. LV EF 20%. Sig dyssynchrony
present (inf wall >230msec after ant wall). Consider
resychonrization therapy. RV size nml. AV nml. 2+ MR. 2+ TR. Mod
PA sHTN.

CT C-Spine [**5-14**]:
1. Acute Type II odontoid fracture with 3-4 mm of apicoposterior
distraction of the dental fracture fragment, relative to the [**Name (NI) 12952**]
body. No visible impingement on the thecal sac at this level.
Extensive prevertebral soft tissue swelling. This fracture is
unstable.
2. Stable bony fusion at C5-C7, with unchanged disc herniation.


CT Torso [**5-14**]:
1. Pulmonary edema, with large right and small left pleural
effusions and associated atelectasis due to heart failure.
2. Diffuse anasarca, perihepatic ascites, periportal edema,
gallbladder wall and bowel wall thickening, all likely secondary
to right heart failure and/or chronic liver disease, which
should be correlated with clinical data.
3. No acute fractures. Old fracture of posterior right 11th rib.
Severe degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine.
4. No evidence of trauma to the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 61 yo M with h/o EtOh abuse, alcoholic
cardiomyopathy (EF 15%), DM II, CRI, admitted to the MICU s/p
fall with C2 dens fracture s/p HALO placement, aspiration PNA
and respiratory failure s/p intubation converted to
tracheostomy, now awaiting rehab placement.

1) Respiratory Failure now improved
Admitted with severe aspiration PNA s/p intubation. Converted to
tracheostomy [**5-17**] given dens fracture and concern for
ventilation. On Levaquin/Flagyl day [**7-12**] for treatment. Sputum
growing non-fermenter GNR, likely Acinetobacter.  Needs to
complete 14 day course of Abx - 1 week of Abx remains on day of
discharge.  Please continue to wean down oxygen as needed and
cap trach as tolerated.  Please provide Passy-Muir valve when no
longer requires o2 prior to removal of trach.

2. Dens fracture:
HALO placed by Ortho [**5-15**]. Patient will need repeat surgery in
future for definitive treatment of dens fracture.  Per ortho,
requires several months of attempt at HALO-vest to heal fracture
given his high surgical risk.  Please contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] at
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 11061**] to schedule a follow up appointment.  Her HALO
must be maintained at all times.  Please move to chair as
tolerated and rehab as necessary.  Please continue pain
medication as needed.

3. ARF - Improved with IVF.  Likely prerenal azotemia.  Resolved
on discharge.

4. Transaminitis
Due to alcoholic liver disease. No need for further w/u

5. EtOH CM
EF with 15-20%. Currently euvolemic. Diuretics held during ICU
stay given hypotension. ACE restarted and tolerating well.

6. Afib
Not anti-coagulated due to hx of recurrent falls and recent dens
fracture.  Cont amiodarone and digoxin for rate control.  No
anticoagulation given recent dens fracture.

7) H/o EtOH abuse
No clear h/o DTs, but has been admitted in the past for EtOH
withdrawal. Unclear when last drink was.  Cont thiamine, folate,
MVI.

8) DM II - HgbA1c 4.8 in [**5-6**]. Not on oral hypoglycemics or
insulin.  Monitor FS as needed.

9) Thrombocytopenia
Stable. Likely due to baseline liver disease

10) Anemia
