Pertinent Results:
[**2133-2-10**] Echo: This is a limited study for emergency mediastinal
exploration 24 hrs. after AVR/CABG. The patient is on high dose
pressors, no inotropes. There is a pericardial collection
measuring 1.5 cm near the anterior wall. There no evidence of
right-sided collapse. This corresponded clinically to a large
amount of clot found after the chest was opened. There was
little ongoing bleeding. There is 1+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 16631**]
fxn is mildly depressed. There is a well-seated prosthetic
aortic valve with a residual peak gradient of 23 and mean of 11
mmHg. No leak and no AI. Aorta intact.

[**2133-2-15**] CXR: Small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88485**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2133-2-9**] for surgical
management of his aortic valve and coronary artery disease. He
was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting to two vessels and replacement of his
aortic valve. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, high output from his chest
tube was noted. He was returned to the Operating Room where he
underwent a re-exploration for bleeding with evacuation of clot.
No focal bleeding was found and hemostasis was achieved. He was
returned to the intensive care unit in stable condition.  He was
later weaned form sedation and extubated without issue.

Gentle diuresis was initiated. Beta blockade, a statin and
aspirin were resumed. He developed atrial fibrillation and was
started on amiodarone for this.  He then developed junctional
rhythm and amiodarone was discontinued.  Sinus rhythm ensued and
beta blockade was titrated as tolerated.  On postoperative day
two, he was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per
protocol. The Physical Therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. Blood
pressure medications were titrated for better control. On
post-op day seven he was potentially going to be discharged but
spiked a temperature of 100.1 . He remained stable, the
temperature remained down and he  continued to make good
progress and was cleared for discharge to Newbridge on the
[**Doctor Last Name **].

All follow-up appointments were made or advised. he did have
some skin tearing to the right of the mid sternal wound, which
was dry and had resolved erythema at discharge when seen with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
