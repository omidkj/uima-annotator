Echocardiogram: IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with global biventricular hypokinesis. Moderate
mitral regurgitation. Increased PCWP.  In the absence of a
history of prominent systemic hypertension, an infiltrative
process should be considered (e.g., amyloid, Fabry's, etc.)
.
Chest X-ray ([**2100-10-18**]):IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared
to [**10-16**]: Moderate cardiomegaly and small right pleural
effusion have increased since [**10-15**] and 19. There has not
been enough change in the appearance of the pulmonary
interstitium to say that pulmonary edema is present and there is
no mediastinal vascular engorgement, but the most likely
explanation is volume related to cardiac decompensation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course By Problem:
[**Name (NI) **] is a 79 year old female with a PMH significant for DM,
HTN, and RAD who presented with symptoms of fatigue and nausea,
found to have an anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia,
bradycardia, hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **], who was initially admitted to
the MICU for management of her multiple medical problems.
.
#) Anion gap metabolic acidosis: at the time of admission,
patient had been complaining of fatigue for 5-7 days prior to
presentation, it was unclear if the fatigue and malaise was due
to a possible infection given left shift on differential.  The
initial concern was that her overall fatigue and malaise led to
decreased po intake causing dehydration, which caused poor
perfusion and lactate production.  On admission her lactate was
found to be 5.5, she was aggressively volume resuscitated with
4L of NS in the ER and over the next day her lactate decreased
to 2.1 then to 1.7, and her anion gap closed.  The lactic
acidosis was also likely exacerbated by continued administration
of metformin prior to her presentation to the hospital.  Her
chestx-ray had shown a possible RLL PNA, so she was empirically
treated with levaquin.  After closure of her initial anion gap,
symptomatically she felt much better, and was able to tolerate
po intake and maintain hydration without further IV fluid
supplementation.
.
#) Bradycardia: on presentation to the ER patient had an episode
of bradycardia, with a HR in the 40's for about one hour.  The
EKG looked like it was junctional, and her potassium was found
to be 5.9, peaked at 6.8, which was thought to be the likely
cause.  The initial episode resolved, she was monitored on
telemetry with no further episodes of bradycardia.
.
#) Hypotension: on admission found to have systolic blood
pressures in the 80's to 90's, her blood pressure responded to
aggressive fluid resuscitation, and her outpatient medications
were held.  During her hospital stay, her blood pressure
medications continued to be held, and at the time of discharge
no anti-hypertensives had been restarted as her SBP's had been
mostly in the 120's to 130's.  On discharge her daughter was
instructed to check her mother's blood pressure daily and if the
SBP was greater than 140, she should restart her enalapril.  She
was also scheduled for outpatient follow up with her PCP for
further BP medication titration.
.
#) Hyperkalemia: on admission, found to have K=5.9 which then
increased and peaked at 6.8.  Thought to be due to decreased po
intake leading to [**Last Name (un) **] with concurrent ACEi administration.
Potassium normalized the morning of [**10-16**], and remaine
