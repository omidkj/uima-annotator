Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for CHF symptoms and Type B aortic dissection
seen on CTA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
CC:[**CC Contact Info 56848**].
HPI: Ms. [**Known firstname **] is a 44 year old woman with a history of childhood
ASD repair, and in [**9-/2132**], an ascending aortic dissection
treated with a 30mm tube graft and a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical aortic
valve.  Last ECHO (post op in '[**31**]) had an EF of 40%.  Post
operatively a [**Company 1543**] Sigma SDR303 B pacemaker was placed due
to complete heart block. The patient subsequently had a
generator change due to the recent [**Company 1543**] advisory in
[**Month (only) 956**] of this year.  She was admitted 2 days ago to [**Hospital1 **] with SOB and worsening exertional chest pressure. Of
note, Mrs. [**Known lastname 6818**] states that she has had generally stable
exertional SOB and chest pressure lasting for 30 minutes at a
time ever since her [**2131**] surgery. She has not had a TTE, stress
test, or cath since that procedure. At baseline, she uses a
wheelchair due to extremely poor exercise tolerance. She states
that over the last several months, she has had worsening
symptoms, with significant DOE with minimal exertion.
.
At the OSH, she was found to be hemodynamically stable with
decreased breath sounds.  A CTA was ordered to rule out PE and
demonstrated a large descending aortic aneurysm.  Labs
demonstrated HCT of 35, a Troponin I of 0.08 with a BNP of 808
and a normal WBC count of 6.8.  CXR demonstrated mild cardiac
enlargement and mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup of her aneurysm.

.
Upon arrival, she appeared stable and was CP free.  Films from
the OSH were reviewed with radiology this evening and revealed a
persistent, large aortic aneurysm from the distal end of her
30mm graft extending to below the margins of the film (below the
renal arteries).  The aneurysm had a very small lumen.  These
films were also reviewed with surgery and comparison to prior
films showed similar aneurysm present 1 and a half years ago and
perhaps some persistance as early as [**2131**] (difficult to read the
film from '[**31**]).  Based on the non-acute nature of this aneurysm,
the decision to observe overnight and let surgery review
tomorrow. In house, her CXR confirmed mild pulmonary edema, and
BNP was 2300.

Pertinent Results:
[**2134-5-11**] TTE:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen
by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed.
3. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right
ventricular
systolic function appears depressed.
4. A mobile density is seen in the descending aorta consistent
with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
5. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and
transvalvular gradients.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8. Compared with the previous study of [**2132-9-29**], left
ventricular systolic function has deteriorated.

[**2134-5-12**] Cardiac Cath:

COMMENTS:
1. Supravalvular aortography was performed after gaining
arterial access
via the RFA. By hand injection of 10cc IV contrast just above
the aortic
valve, catheter position was confirmed to be in the true lumen
of the
aorta.
2. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
demonstrated no significant CAD. The LMCA was short and patent.
The LAD
was normal. The dominant LCX was larger than the LAD. The RCA
was
non-dominant with a small rPDA and no rPL.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred due to high filling
pressures.
4. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated right and
left
sided filling pressures with RVEDP=51 mmHg and mean PCWP=42
mmHg.
Pulmonary artery pressures were elevated with PASP=75 mmHg. The
cardiac
output was depressed with CI=1.7 L/min/m2. She demonstrated a 25
mmHg
pulsus paradoxus with concomitant fall in RV pressure,
indicating a
very low liklihood of constrictive physiology. As well, there
was marked
respiratory variation in the RA and PASP of >55 mmHg, also
arguing
against constrictive physiology.
5. Full shunt run demonstrated no evidence of significant
intracardiac
shunting.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. No evidence of constrictive physiology.
4. No evidence of intracardiac shunt.
5. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

CTA Chest/Abd/Pelvis:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is an aortic dissection,
which extends from the region of the junction of the ascending
aorta and aortic arch and extends inferiorly down to the iliac
bifurcation. There is evidence of prior median sternotomy and
aortic valve replacement. There is no evidence of a mediastinal
hematoma or aortic rupture. There is a left-sided pacer in place
with surrounding subcutaneous air and a hematoma. There is
cardiomegaly. All vessels extending off the aorta opacify with
contrast briskly. The SMA, celiac, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] arteries all extend
off the true lumen. The renal arteries bilaterally appear to
extend off of both the true and false lumen. Extension of the
dissection into the renal arteries cannot be definitively
determined. The dissection also extends superiorly to involve
the left subclavian artery. There is delayed enhancement of the
false lumen within the descending aorta, with near equal mixture
of contrast more inferiorly, suggesting possible prior
dissection fenestration procedure.
There are no pleural effusions. There is a calcified granuloma
within the left lower lobe. There is a 4-mm noncalcified
pulmonary nodule within the right lower lobe (series 5, image
45). There are prominent bilateral axillary and supraclavicular
lymph nodes.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The liver,
spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands are unremarkable
on this single phase of contrast study. There are scattered
paraaortic retroperitoneal and mesenteric nodes. The largest is
a 1-cm right-sided aortocaval node.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Stranding is identified
within the right groin consistent with recent catheterization.
There are scattered, non- pathologically enlarged inguinal nodes
bilaterally.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or s
