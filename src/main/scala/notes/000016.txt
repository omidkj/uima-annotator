Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year-old woman with
a past medical history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia
who was transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] for emergent
cardiac catheterization since she presented to that hospital
earlier this evening of admission with complaints of 6 out of
10 abdominal indigestion.  The patient noted back pain, but
denies nausea or vomiting.  Electrocardiogram showed ST
segment elevations about 6 mm in leads V2, V3 and 5 mm
changes in V5, 3 mm in V6 and 3 mm changes in leads 2 and
AVL.  The patient with old right bundle branch block and with
reciprocal changes in the inferior leads.  The patient was
given Lopressor, nitroglycerin and Integrilin at the outside
hospital with chest pain that decreased to 1.5 out of 10.  Of
note patient with similar complaints on Sunday.  At that time
those complaints were associated with nausea and vomiting as
well.  In the catheterization laboratory the patient
underwent stenting of the mid left anterior descending
coronary artery lesion due to 50% proximal and 50% first
septal and 100% mid occlusion.  The patient also underwent
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left
anterior descending coronary artery just beyond flow stent.
The patient had multiple infusions of intracoronary
nitroglycerin and Diltiazem to improve flow.  Hemodynamically
the patient's right atrium was a pressure of 10, PA of 42/21,
wedge pressure of 26, cardiac output 3.24, cardiac index
1.95, FVR 2100.  The patient was given 10 mg of intravenous
Lasix and transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.

2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Status post appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes a rash.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol 50 once a day.
2.  Lipitor 10 once a day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Former tobacco smoker about half a pack per
day for five yeas.  Alcohol before dinner occasionally.  No
drugs.  She lives at home with her older sister.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 150/80.
Pulse 78.  O2 sat 96% on 2 liters.  In general, she is a
pleasant elderly woman in no acute distress.  HEENT
normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Mucous
membranes are moist.  Clear oropharynx.  Cardiovascular
regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  1 out 6 systolic
ejection murmur.  JVP at about 8 cm.  Lungs clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Good dorsalis pedis pulses and
posterior tibial pulses 2+ bilaterally.  Right groin arterial
sheath and Swan in place.  Skin no rashes or lesions.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 11.4, hematocrit
38.9, platelets 319, sodium 138, K 4.2, chloride 103, bicarb
26, BUN 23, creatinine 1.0, albumin 4.1, troponin 0.79.
Electrocardiogram as described previously.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 75 year-old woman with a history
of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia status post large
anterior myocardial infarction with placement of stent in the
mid left anterior descending coronary artery.  At
catheterization the patient was noted to have an elevated
wedge pressure and residual lesion of the left circumflex,
which was not intervened on.

1.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient has a large
anterior myocardial infarction and catheterization results as
noted above.  The patient was continued on aspirin, Plavix,
Integrilin for 18 hours and then discontinued.  Also
continued on heparin and beta-blocker was continued as
tolerated.  The patient was continued on her Lipitor 80 mg
and weaned off her nitro drip.  Otherwise the patient
remained mostly chest pain free throughout the course of her
stay.  She was started on a beta-blocker and titrated up as
tolerated and the patient was evaluated by the EP team for
possible risk stratification in the future secondary to her
anterior myocardial infarction and decreased ejection
fraction.  She did continue to have some episodes on
telemetry of tachycardia with exertion and plans were made to
have an outpatient Holter monitor and an outpatient stress in
six weeks time with T wave alternans at which time she will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] following those studies and to
reassess her obtuse marginal and right coronary artery
lesions for a possible reintervention.  The patient was also
started on low level Coumadin for three to four months of
anticoagulation for her anterior myocardial infarction and
hypokinesis of her anterior wall and decreased ejection
fraction.  For this she was also started on Lovenox as a
bridge waiting for Coumadin to become therapeutic and can
have this followed as an outpatient.  Goal INR of 1.5 at
which time she can discontinued her Lovenox.  The patient was
given teaching of her Lovenox during her stay and understood
injections.  Otherwise the patient was also started on ace
inhibitor to improve cardiac function and for her decreased
ejection fraction.

2.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient with an ejection
fraction of 35% after her anterior myocardial infarction.
She had akinesis of her mid distal and anterior septum,
distal anterior wall and apical akinesis and the patient was
continued on her ace inhibitor for after load reduction and
we started her on low dose Coumadin.  The patient's Is and Os
were monitored and she did receive some Lasix on a prn basis.
She was transfused one unit of blood for a hematocrit less
then 30 and was followed by a dose of Lasix as she had some
bibasilar crackles following the blood.

3.  Hematuria:  The patient had some hematuria, which was
likely secondary to a traumatic Foley placement during
admission, however, the patient was recommended to have
outpatient cystoscopy and urology follow up as she will get
this further evaluated once acute process is resolved.

4.  Nutrition:  The patient was continued on a cardiac diet
and her electrolytes were followed closely.  The patient was
seen and evaluated by physical therapy with no acute needs
for rehab or physical therapy.  The patient was ambulating
without difficulty or without desaturation or orthostasis.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.  Discharged with services for
Lovenox teaching.  The patient ambulating without difficulty
and not requiring oxygen.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Anterior wall myocardial infarction.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Hematuria.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lovenox 100 mg subq q day until INR greater then 1.5.
2.  Coumadin 5 mg po q day for three to four months with goal
INR of 1.5.
3.  Toprol XL 100 mg one po q day.
4.  Lisinopril 10 mg one po q day.
5.  Sublingual nitroglycerin prn.
6.  Atorvastatin 80 mg po q day.
7.  Plavix 75 mg one po q day.
8.  Aspirin 325 mg one po q day.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with her
primary care physician on [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**].  The patient is to have her
INR checked at that time and adjusted accordingly.  The
patient is to follow up with an outpatient neurologist and
establish herself with a local cardiologist once she sees her
local primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] she will follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2126-4-17**].  The patient will have a
Holter monitor placed on [**4-8**] and then will return for a
stress test with T wave alternans on [**4-9**].
