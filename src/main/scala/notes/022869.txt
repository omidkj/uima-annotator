mass.  The surgery went as planned with no complications and
minimal blood loss.  She then stayed in the PACU overnight as
standard for craniotomy patients.  She had regular hourly
neurologic and vital signs checks.  She was started on decadron,
GI prophylaxis, a bowel regimen, and sliding scale insulin.  She
had an uncomplicated PACU course and was transferred to the
regular floor on [**6-20**].  She continued to do well on the floor.
Her vital signs and lab results remained normal as her decadron

catheter was discontinued after she was moved to the regular
floor.  She continued to improve and was discharged on [**2182-6-22**].
