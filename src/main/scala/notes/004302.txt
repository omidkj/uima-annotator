Chief Complaint:
Acute liver failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15674**] is a 52 year old male with a pmh of DMII, EtOH abuse,
and Crohn's disease who presented to an OSH after a night of
partying with friends where they had wine and raw oysters. He
went home and slept until he awoke with acute N/V/D and fevers.

At the OSH he was found to be in ALF with AST of >5000, ALT >
3000 INR of 3.2 and platelets of 62. Given his history of EtOH
abuse he was given a dose of steroids, covered for vibrio with
doxycycline and ceftriaxone, and started on NAC drip (Tylenol
level <15). Per report, U/S was negative at the OSH ED. After
acute worsening of his liver failure and development of
encephalopathy/withdrawal, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
ongoing care.

Prior to transfer he had received a total of 16mg Ativan, 2mg
Haldol for agitation and withdrawal. QTc on arrival is 410.

On arrival to the MICU, he is extremely agitated. Thrashing in
the bed trying to break free of restraints kicking the bed.
Easily redirectable for short periods of times. Initially vitals
were with HR in 120s, BP 110s/60s, RR 16 and temp of 102.3.
However, he became acutely agitated and BP elevated to 210/120s,
HR in 150s. Given 2mg IV ativan, 5mg IV haldol. Fan and cooling
blanket being used to help cool patient.

   C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final [**2192-6-28**]):
      Negative for toxigenic C. difficile by the Illumigene DNA
      amplification assay.
           (Reference Range-Negative).

      This test does not reliably detect Cryptosporidium,
Cyclospora or
      Microsporidium. While most cases of Giardia are detected
by routine
      O+P, the Giardia antigen test may enhance detection when
organisms
      are rare.

[**2192-6-25**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Mild pulmonary artery hypertension. Mildly dilated
thoracic aorta.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2187**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
.
[**2192-6-25**] LIVER/GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND:
IMPRESSION:
Increased liver echogenicity, compatible with fatty deposition.
However, more advanced types of liver disease,
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded.  No discrete hepatic
lesion.  Hepatic vasculature is patent.
.
[**2192-6-25**] CXR:
NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Heart size is top normal.  There
is prominence of the right pulmonary artery, most likely
asymmetric due to patient rotation. Mild vascular edema is
present, but no overt consolidations to suggest infectious
process are seen.
.
[**2192-6-25**] CT ABDOMEN and PELVIS with CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Fatty liver.
2.  No evidence of colitis or intra-abdominal abscesses.
3.  Small left lower lobe consolidation, might represent
subsegmental
atelectasis, still, infection cannot be ruled out.
.
[**2192-6-26**] RENAL ULTRASOUND:
FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 12.3 cm and the left kidney
measures 11.2 cm.  There is no hydronephrosis.  No cyst or stone
or solid mass is seen in either kidney.  No perinephric fluid
collection is identified.  The bladder is collapsed on a Foley
catheter.
