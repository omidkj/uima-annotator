Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo F admitted with HCV cirrhosis, on transplant list, here
for fatigue and increasing jaundice found to be hyponatremic and
hyperkalemic with progressively rising bilirubin and INR,
worsening hepatic function, MELD of 48. She was admitted to the
MICU where she was intubated for airway management secondary to
continued
decompensation. She was placed on a free water restriction,
diuretics were held,  albumin 25g [**Hospital1 **], octreotide and midodrine
were given.

Baseline HCT was in 30s then decreased to the low to mid 20s.
Stool was guaiac positive. There was concern for slow GI bleed
given portal gastropathy, grade I varices and a healed gastric
ulcer. She received FFP and PRBC.

On [**4-8**] a liver donor was available from a CDC high risk donor.
This donor did have NAT testing that was negative for HCV, HIV
and HBV. Her HIV, HBV, HCV serology were also negative. She
underwent orthotopic deceased donor liver transplant
(piggyback), portal vein to portal vein anastomosis, common bile
duct to common bile duct anastomosis(no T tube), common hepatic
artery (donor) to proper hepatic artery (recipient) end-to-end.
Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Please see operative report
for complete details. Two JP drains were placed. EBL was
10,000cc. She received 27 units of PRBC, crytalloid, cryo, ffp,
and cellsaver. She received standard induction immunosuppression
consisting of solumedrol and cellcept. Immediately postop, she
was transferred intubated to the SICU. She was febrile to 101
postop. Blood cultures drawn which were negative. The PICC line
was removed and the tip cultured. This culture was negative. She
continued to receive blood products. JPs were draining ~100cc
each with serosang fluid.

On POD 1 a duplex liver US showed the hepatic veins and portal
veins to be patent with normal waveforms. The main hepatic
artery and intrahepatic arterial branches were patent, although
mild reduction of diastolic flow was noted. There were no
peri-transplant fluid collections and there was no intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation. Prograf was started. LFTS
slowly trended down.

On pod 2, she was extubated without incident. A CXR showed
volume overload. A lasix drip was given. Repeat CXR showed
improvement. She was slow to wake up and had mild confusion.
Pain medication was adjusted. Diet was advanced slowly and
tolerated although appetite was poor.

The lateral JP was removed on pod 6. PT evaluated and
recommended rehab. She tended to desat to the mid 80s off O2
when ambulating. Nasal cannula O2 was continued. Aggressive
diuresis with lasix continued for postop weight that was up
10-15kg from preop. Breath sounds were decreased in the right
base.

On pod 5, a repeat liver duplex showed similar findings as on
pod 1 with mild reduction of diastolic flow noted.

Alk phos trended up daily to 433 on [**4-22**] from pod 1 of 106.
T.bili continued to trend down to 3.0 from 16 immediately
postop. A liver biopsy was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**] after
US marking. Biopsy demonstrated no rejection and features were
consistent with mild resolving ischemic/reperfusion injury. Post
biopsy, vital signs remained stable and a post biopsy HCT was
stable. The medial JP was removed.

Alk phos continued to increase and an ERCP was performed on
[**4-25**]. This demonstrated sharp angulation at the level of duct to
duct anastomosis without definitive stricture or filling defects
identified. Mild duct dilation was noted proximal and distal to
the anastamosis. A stent was placed. She tolerated this
procedure well without complications. On [**4-26**], the alk phos was
584 and t.bili was 2.7.  Alk phos continued to slowly trend
down. Ursodiol was not ordered given potential GI side effects
with her present complaints of indigestion.

Cellcept was changed to [**Hosp
