Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, CHF exacerberation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/Extubation


History of Present Illness:
75 yo F with h/o HTN, CHF, DM II, ? h/o prior MI, and lung CA
s/p partial lung resection [**2179**] who presents with worsening
shortness of breath and cough X 1 week along with subjective
fevers. The pt reports that her cough is productive in nature
and began on Monday. Since then, she has had a steadily
increasing sensation of shortness of breath. Further history was
unable to be obtained [**2-22**] respiratory distress.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 101, SBP 210s, HR 90s, O2 sat
86% on RA. On exam, she was speaking in full sentences without
overt difficulty. She was given metoprolol 5 mg IV X 2 for her
elevated SBP with worsening of her shortness of breath and the
pt was placed on a [**Month/Day (2) 597**] with O2 sats in the upper 90s. An EKG
showed increased ectopy but otherwise no new dynamic ischemic
changes and a CXR was significant for increased fluid suggestive
of CHF exacerbation and a basilar opacity in the left lower lobe
could not be ruled out for possible pneumonia. She was given 100
IV lasix with 800 ccs urine output over 1 hr, ceftriaxone 1 gm X
1, azithromycin 500 mg X 1, and started on a nitro gtt with
improvement in SBPs down to the 150s. An ABG on either RA or [**Name (NI) 597**]
(unclear from charting) was 7.40/34/57/22. She was then admitted
to the CCU for CHF exacerbation.
.
Of note, the pt was admitted in [**12-25**] with similar symptoms of
cough and shortness breath and was treated for a CHF
exacerbation as well as PNA. She had a TTE performed that showed
a LVEF 45% with septal hypokinesis and RV apical free wall
hypokinesis. A p-MIBI showed no perfusion defects and a LVEF
54%. She was discharged and followed up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**5-26**]
whose impression was that diastolic heart failure exacerbation
was the etiology of her admission.
.
Further ROS of systems unable to be obtained [**2-22**] respiratory
distress, pt placed on BIPAP.
