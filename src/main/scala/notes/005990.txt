Brief Hospital Course:
1. Rhythm: On transfer, no QT prolongation on EKG. Restarted on
amio drip. Developed episode of torsade de pointes. Amio stopped
and given Mg. Subsequently developed multiple episodes of
torsades de [**Last Name (un) **], each preceded by slower HR (in 60s) and
PAC's that are followed by a pause. Became unconscious with one
episode requiring 200J shock. Given total of 6gm IV mg.
Isoproterenol considered, but not started given risk of
increasing PACs. Temporary pacing not started, given risk of
putting in line with INR 3.2.  Torsades de pointes, was thought
likely adverse effect of amio. She had a BiV/ICD placement.
Interrogation of pacer found that it was pacing well. Pt
subsequently complained of palpitations in her left groin. She
was found to have diaphragmatic pacing from the LV pacing lead
(likely via the phrenic nerve) which was positional and occurred
when she ambulated. LV pacing lead was turned off and pt was
continued pacing with the RV lead. There were no plans to revise
the LV pacing wire; it was decided to keep the wire off until
the wire fibroses in place. Pt was restarted on beta blocker to
treat non-sustained atrial tachycardia. She was restarted on
coumadin for her AF. Pt was instructed to f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
as an outpatient.
.
2. CHF: Pt appeared volume overloaded on admission and was
diuresed with IV lasix, until euvolemic.
.
3. CAD: No active issues. Pt was continued on bb, asa, acei.
.
4. DM:  Pt was continued on 70/30 and insulin sliding scale
