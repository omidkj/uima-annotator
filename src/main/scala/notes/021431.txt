History of Present Illness:
77-year-old male with a history of known 3 vessel disease,
diabetes, atrial fibrillation, morbid obesity and end stage
renal disease on peritoneal dialysis with bilateral above the
knee amputations who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2151-12-19**] for eval
for CABG but now not felt to be surgical candidate and now being
treated medically.

For complete admission history, please see [**Hospital1 1516**] admission note
and ICU transfer note. Briefly, "LHC on [**2151-12-23**] showed
completely occluded vessels except for LAD, with 70% stenosis,
so underwent no PCI. Pre-LHC SBPs were 120s-140s. Post-LHC,
carvedilol 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] was increased to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], and the
patient had an extra liter taken off during PD. Recent
antibiotic changes included ceftriaxone converted to
ciprofloxacin and vancomycin for treatment of Morangella and
MSSA growing from the right stump. Overnight, SBP were noted to
be in the 70s, and the patient was somnolent. He was given 1
liter of NS- SBP improved to 90s and mental status improved. SBP
then dropped in 70s again, and he received another 1.5 liters of
NS. Lactate 2.4. Stable hematocrit post LHC. No pulsus paradoxus
on exam. PICC and 22 gauge in hand. Patient was then transferred
from [**Hospital Ward Name **] to the MICU for hypotension.

He originally presented to OSH in [**2151-10-7**] with NSTEMI and was
treated medically at that time as he was being treated for a
MRSA bacteremia from his right AKA stump infection. Since then
he has had multiple episodes of anginal CP occuring at rest,
relived by nitro. States his last occurence of CP was 4 days
ago. Currently, denies CP/SOB/N/V, lightheadeness, palpitations.
States he feels at his baseline.

On arrival to the MICU, he had a temp of 96.1, HR 71, BP 115/63,
RR 18 and O2 sats of 95% on 3L NC. He was well oriented and
mentating well. His BP is intermittently in the 80s, and is very
difficult to get an accurate pressure given his habitus and
prior UE AV fistulas." Patient was on norepinephrine from [**12-26**]
to [**12-28**] and weaned off without any incident. Patient was
thought to have peritonitis although no cultures positive (and
not enough wbc in peritoneal fluid) but question possible yeast
infection. Patient is currently on
fluconazole/meropenem/vancomycin; vanc now held due to high
level.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
