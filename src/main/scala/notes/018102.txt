TTE [**2127-1-20**] (preop)
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal study. No structural heart disease or
pathologic flow identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
After  an inpatient Plavix washout he was taken to the Operating
Room on [**2127-1-23**] where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft
x 2. He  tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably. The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support.

 Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward his preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery. Beta blockers were
titrated for rate and blood pressure control. Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.

He did have a temperature to 101.1 on POD3.  He was cultured,but
there was no growth to date at the time of discharge.  His CXR
showed no signs of infiltrate and he was afebrile with a normal
white blood cell count at the time of discharge.  The patient
was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility.

By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating
independently, the wound was healing well, he was tolerating a
full oral diet and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged home with visiting nurse services in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
