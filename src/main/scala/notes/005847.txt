Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats and possible

premature beat. Left bundle-branch block with left axis
deviation. Consider left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to

prominent but there may be no significant change.

to 5 cm consistent with bowel obstruction.

[**2172-7-13**] ABD/PELVIC CT W/CONTRAST:
1. Multiple dilated loops of small and large bowel consistent

Filling defect in the proximal SMA consistent with occlusive
thrombus with

mesenteric ischemia. No pneumatosis, bowel wall thickening, or
portal venous gas identified.
2. Airspace densities noted at the lung bases bilaterally with
small bilateral pleural effusions. Findings may represent
sequelae of aspiration. Clinical correlation is recommended.
3. 8-mm hypodense cystic lesion in the body of the kidney. A
follow up CT is recommended in [**5-8**] months.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the SICU under the management of the
General Surgical Service on [**2172-7-13**] for evaluation of an ileus
versus mechanical obstruction. The patient was also hypotensive
and tachycardic upon admission. She was made NPO, received IV
fluid rescusitation and electrolyte repletement, and an NGT and
foley catheter were placed. An ABD/Pelvic CT with contrast was
performed, which was maily remarkable for multiple dilated loops
of small and large bowel consistent with ileus and a filling
defect in the proximal SMA consistent with occlusive thrombus
with filling distal to thrombus. Findings concerning for early
mesenteric ischemia. No pneumatosis, bowel wall thickening, or
portal venous gas was identified. The Vascular Service was
consulted for the finding of the SMA filling defect; no vascular
intervention was recommended, but lifetime anticoagulation with
warfarin was recommended. She was started on a Heparin infusion
at that time.

The patient improved with conservative measures. Hypotension and
tachycardia resolved with hydration and adjustment of
metoprolol. Abdominal distension improved with NGT decompression
and bowel rest. The patient experienced a return of bowel
function after an enema and manual stool disimpaction on
[**2172-7-15**]. The NGT was discontinued, and she was started on sips
of clears with good tolerability. The foley catheter was also
discontinued on [**2172-7-17**]; she was able to void without problem.

She was transferred to the floor on [**2172-7-15**] in good condition,
continued on the Heparin infusion. Her diet was advanced to
regular with good tolerability, and IV fluids discontinued. On
[**2172-7-16**], the IV Heparin infusion was discontinued, and she was
started on Warfarin 1mg in the evening and Lovenox Sub-Q daily.
The plan is to discharge her on a Lovenox-Warfarin bridge until
her INR is therapeutic, at which time it has been recommended
that she continue on Warfarin anticoagulation for lifetime. INR
goal 2.5; therapeutic range 2-3.

On [**2172-7-17**], unable to wean the patient off supplemental oxygen
as the patient became tachycardic and experienced desaturation
to 84-86% on room air only. Returned to 93-95% on 4-5L O2 via
NC. An EKG was unchanged from baseline. A CXR revealed bibasilar
atelectasis. The patient received albuterol nebulizer treatments
PRN and vigorous respiratory toilet with good response. No
contraindication to planned [**Hospital1 1501**] discharge. She will be
transferred on oxygen therapy.

At the time of discharge on [**2172-7-17**], the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a
regular diet with fair intake, ambulating with assistance,
voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.  She
was discharged back to a skilled nursing facility on the
Lovenox-Warfarin bridge and supplemental oxygen. She will
follow-up with Vascular in 8 weeks. The patient received
discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.
