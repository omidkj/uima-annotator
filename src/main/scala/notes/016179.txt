History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is 71 year old male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia,
hypertension, and family history of CAD, who presents with
Second Degree Type II AV Block. Patient reports being in his
normal state of health up until one month ago when routine
stress testing at his cardiologist office showed occasional
second degree Type II AV Block. At that time he was told that
this could be further evaluated in approximately one month and
he may need a pacemaker down the road.  In addition, his
metoprolol was decreased from 50mg to 25mg daily.  For the last
week the patient notes increased shortness of breath with
activity, noting fatigue/shortness of breath when walking [**Age over 90 **]
yards to the mail box. He also endorses occasional dizziness
over the past week with exertion, but no syncope. Patient notes
no other abdominal pain, heart palpitations, or diaphoresis.
Throughout this time patient thought these symptoms were
releated to his COPD. At PCP today patient's ECG showed type II
Second Degree AV block. Was sent to ED. In ED at OSH Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**]
sent patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for pacmaker placement.

In the CCU, pt asymptomatic in bed with a heart rate of 33 and
blood pressure of 134/64. Patient denies any current shortness
of breath, dizziness, chest pain, or palpitations.  On
evaluation by the EP service on admission, carotid massage was
noted to resolve AV block resulting in 1:1 conduction.

On review of systems, He denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the

palpitations, or syncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is 71 year old male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia,
hypertension, COPD and family history of CAD, who complains of
dyspnea on exertion for the past week and was found to have
Second Degree Type II AV Block at a PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].

# RHYTHM: He was admitted with Mobitz Type II heart block on
ECG. The block was infranodal and conduction improved with
carotid massage.  He remained stable overnight after admission
with heart rate in the 30's.  He then had a dual chamber
[**Company 1543**] pacemaker placed without complications with HV time of
85msec. Afterword, he remained in a ventricular paced rhythm. He
was maintained on metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]. CXR after pacemaker
placement showed appropriate lead placement.

# CORONARIES/PUMP: Patient has not recently had a cardiac
catheterization or echo.  He reports a cardiac cath 10 years ago
which showed two 30% lesions.  Continued aspirin 325mg po daily
and his home dose of simvastatin 40mg po daily.  He was also
continued on metoprolol as above.

# HYPERTENSION: Continued home lisinopril 20mg daily and
metoprolol as above.

# DIABETES: The patient was maintained on an insulin sliding
scale during admission.  Metformin was restarted at discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital due to a slow heart rate.  You
had a slow heart rate because there was a block in the
conduction system in your heart.  To fix this problem, you
received a pacemaker ([**Name (NI) 1543**] dual chamber pacemaker).  You
will need to keep the dressing over the pacemaker clean and dry
for one week until your appointment with the device clinic. You
cannot shower but may take a bath as long as the dressing stays
dry. You will take antibiotics for 2 days to prevent an
infection at the site. You cannot lift your left arm over your
head for 6 weeks, including no activities such as swimming or
tennis. No carrying more than 5 pounds for 6 weeks with your
left arm. Please see the discharge instructions regarding
pacemakers that was given to you at discharge.

Medication changes:
1. Cephalexin: to take for 48 hours to prevent an infection at
the pacer site.

Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] if you notice any
