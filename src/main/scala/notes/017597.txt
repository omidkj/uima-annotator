Chief Complaint:
Left leg cellulitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
A 55 Year old female with PMH RA, fibromylagia, hypothyroidism
is transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation of
cellulitis of the left lower extremity due to concern for
necroizing faciitis.
She reports that she had a flu like illness 1 week ago with
associated malaise, nausea and vomiting, she was unable to
tolerate oral intake and did not take spironolactone. She noted
tightness in her left leg beginning 5 days ago and redness
begining 4 days ago distally and spreading proximally to the
hip. She had subjective fevers and chills and presented to the
[**Hospital3 **] ED for evaluation where labs showed WBC 27.6
and Cr 1.36, she was treated with ceftriaxone, vancomycin and
evaluated by surgery who expressed concern for necrotizing
faciitis and recommended transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 100.0 100 120/90 20 99% 2L Nasal
Cannula, Labs showed Cr 1.5 (baseline unknown) Na132 WBC 25.6
89%PMN She was seen by general surgery who recommended CT to
rule out necrotizing faciitis. CT showed diffuse swelling but no
air to suggest necrotizing fasiitis, no abcess. She was given
morphine 5mg IV x3 and admitted to medicine. Vitals: 98 NSR, RR
24, 112/67, 98% 2L NC, temp 98.2

Imaging:
CT Lower leg [**2146-3-31**]: Diffuse subcutaneous soft tissue edema and
fluid along the superficial fascial planes in the left lower
extremity, predominantly in the left leg, consistent with known
history of cellulitis.  No evidence of subcutaneous air to
suggest necrotizing fasciitis.

LENI Left [**2146-4-1**]: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein
thrombosis in the left leg.

CXR [**2146-4-6**]:   Cardiac size is top normal.  Right PICC tip is in
the lower SVC.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Aside from improving atelectasis in the right lower lobe, the
lungs are clear.  There are no new lung abnormalities.


Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo F w/ PMH of morbid obesity, COPD, Rheumatoid Arthritis and
hypothyroidism was treated for Left leg bullous cellulitis and
hospital course complicated by hyponatremia, acute kidney injury
and transient respiratory acidosis.

#Left leg Bullous cellulitis- the patient had extensive bright
red, indurated, hot, entire left leg with edema and concern for
possible necrotizing fascitis so was sent here from Lawrenece
General. CT scan showed no evidence of subcu air, and there was
no evidence on exam of necrotizing fasciitis. She was followed
by surgery who felt no surgical interventions were necessary.
She was originally on vancomycin and when she developed bullae
she was broadened to Vanc/Cefepime and Clinda for a few days.
Dermatology was consulted because of the extensive bullae and
areas of sloughing for concern of something like scaleded skin
syndrome or SJS due to new antibiotics.  They felt that her rash
was consistent with a bullous cellulitis, and took a biopsy on
[**4-4**] to r/o linear IGA reaction to vancomycin.  She was afebrile
and her WBC was downtrending throughout her hospital course and
she was never hypotensive or with signs of sepsis. She was
transitioned to oral antibiotics on [**4-7**] to complete a total of
14 days of antibiotics. At the time of discharge she still has
extensive
