Pertinent Results:
CT ABD/Pelv [**2185-7-22**] IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged enhancing lesion in the lower pole of the right
kidney,
previously characterized as a renal cell carcinoma.
2. Bilateral small renal hypodensities likely represent simple
cysts.
3. Small amount of ascites.
4. Chronic pancreatitis.
5. Severe degenerative changes of the lumbar spine with grade 1
anterolisthesis of L4 over L5.
.
Chest CTA [**7-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Diffuse predominantly peripheral ground-glass opacities.
Primary considerations are ARDS and multifocal pneumonia.
3. Moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions right greater than
left.
.
Chest CT non contrast [**7-28**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse consolidations in both lungs have worsened compared
to [**7-26**], most likely reflecting severe pulmonary edema, and
multifocal pneumonia and/or hemorrhage.
2. Enlarging non-transudative pleural effuisions.
3. Left hilar lymphadenopathy, probably related to the acute
process.
4. Small lingular nodule increased in density on [**2185-7-26**]
compared to [**2182-9-8**]. This finding should be reassessed
after resolution of the acute disease, for possible
bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
.
CXR on [**2185-8-7**] IMPRESSION: Improving interstitial opacities
since the prior chest x-ray.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was initially admitted for pain control of acute on chronic
pancreatitis.  However, after aggressive fluid resuscitation the
pt developped significant respiratory distress. CXR demonstrated
mild copd and mild b/l effusions. EKG at the time was without
evidence of ischemia. Pt was ruled out for MI by enzymes. Given
persistent O2 requirement, CTA checked on [**7-26**] which
demonstrated no PE, but "diffuse predominantly peripheral
ground-glass opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia; the
differential diagnosis would include pulmonary
edema from ARDS," and moderate b/l effusions. Pt was started on
levofloxacin for empirical coverage on [**7-27**].  Pt had been having
intermittent low-grade temps to 100. On [**7-28**] at 4 am, pt had
spike to 101.2. Abx switched to from levoflox to vanc/zosyn.
.
Pt triggered on the floor for resp rate>30 & sats down to low
80s, she was started on a NRB and sats came up to high 80s. CXR
showed evidence of new pulm edema, pt was given lasix 20 mg iv
x3 and had good urine out-put though repeat cxr showed worsened
edema. Pt was transferred to the MICU for continued respiratory
distress and hypoxia.
.
In the MICU, pt diuresed but she continued to be hypoxic and was
managed with non invasive ventilation.  Pt had significant
difficulty weaning and was eventually started on high dose
steroids for treatment of possible BOOP/ARDS or eosinophilic
pna. Pt showed significant clinical improvement with high dose
steroids and was weaned down to 3LNC over 3days.  She was
transfered back to the floor on [**8-7**] for continued management.
.
Pt did well on the floor, her PO intake improved and TPN was
discontinued.  Her abd pain was well controlled with PO pain
medications and was not limiting intake.  Pt was weaned to RA
and was sating well (94%) on RA.  Pt worked with PT and was
cleared to complete all ADLs independantly.  Pt was followed by
pulmonology and they recommended a four week steroid taper as
well as follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1632**] in [**Hospital **] clinic.  Pt was
discharged in stable condition with plan of VNA services to help
with home pain medications.  Insulin regimen was d/c'd per PCP
recommendations and pt will be followed closely in the next few
weeks by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16258**].
