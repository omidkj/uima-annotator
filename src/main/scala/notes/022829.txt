Admission Date: [**2168-8-9**]        Discharge Date: [**2168-8-31**]

Date of Birth:  [**2168-8-9**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NB


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 13291**] [**Known lastname 31251**] is a former 1.98
kilogram product of a 35 and [**7-6**] week gestation pregnancy
born to a 21-year-old G-2, P-0, woman. OB history was notable
for 1 therapeutic abortion. Prenatal screens were blood type
A positive, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR
nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative and group
beta strep status positive, positive human papilloma virus
with normal Pap smears. The mother's medical history is
notable for insulin dependent diabetes type 1 since age 9.
During pregnancy, she had poor control. Prenatal care was
initiated from 20 weeks. She was hospitalized with diabetic
ketoacidosis on [**2168-7-16**]. There was concern for
intrauterine growth restriction with decreased amniotic fluid
volume for the fetus. Also noted was a left ventriculomegaly
on ultrasound that was confirmed by fetal MRI. The mother was
taken to cesarean section due to fetal heart rate
decelerations and concern for decreased amniotic fluid
volume. The infant emerged with good tone and respirations,
needed blow by oxygen. Apgar 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5
minutes. He was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit
for respiratory distress.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to the neonatal
intensive care unit, weight 1.98 kilograms 25th to 50th
percentile, length 44 cm 25th to 50 percentile, head
circumference 31.5 cm 25th to 50th percentile. General:
Alert, pink infant with oxygen saturations 94% to 96% in room
air. A very noticeable skin tag present on the right cheek in
addition to a preauricular skin tag also on the right. Head,
ears, eyes, nose and throat: Anterior fontanelle soft and
flat, sutures opposed. Eyes deep set with a broad nasal
bridge. Positive red reflex bilaterally. Right skin cheek tag
and right preauricular skin tag as previously noted. Palate
normal and intact. Chest: Clear and equal breath sounds,
intermittent mild grunting. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1, S2, normal pulses and perfusion. Abdomen
soft, nondistended, nontender, 3 vessel cord. GU: Normal
male, testes descended bilaterally. Spine: Small skin tag
noted in the sacral area. Spine appears straight. Hips
stable. Neurologic: Normal cry, strength, tone and movement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  By systems including pertinent laboratory
data:
1.  Respiratory: [**Known lastname 13291**] was in room air from admission to the
    neonatal intensive care unit. The mild respiratory
    distress was felt to be transitional, resulted in a few
    hours after birth. He did have an arterial blood gas in
    room air on day of life 7 that was a pH of 7.41, pCO2 of
    40, a pO2 of 44. He has not had any episodes of
    spontaneous apnea or bradycardia. At the time of
    transfer, he is in room air with oxygen saturations
    greater than 95%, respiratory rate of 40 to 80 breaths
    per minute. A chest x-ray was notable for rib anomalies,
    normal heart size, in situs and normal lung fields.

1.  Cardiovascular: A murmur was heard on day of life #1 and
    due to the other congenital anomalies, a cardiac consult
    was obtained. The cardiac consult from [**Hospital1 62374**] recommended an echocardiogram which showed 3
    muscular VSDs, right ventricular hypertension, a PFO, an
    ASD and a moderate PDA. An EKG was also notable for left
    ventricular strain. Cardiology consultation recommended
    reconsultation prior to discharge to arrange outpatient
    follow-up. He developed some respireaotyr distress on [**8-20**] which was determined to be pulmonary edema. He was
    treated with lasix for 3 days. All of his respiratory
    symptoms abated and he had no further episodes.  At the time
    of discharge, he had an audible harsh murmur at the left
    sternal border, baseline heart rate of 140 to 160 beats
    per minute, a recent blood pressure of 66/32 mmHg with
    a mean of 44 mmHg.

1.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: [**Known lastname 13291**] was initially
    NPO and maintained on intravenous fluids. Initial blood
    glucoses were 55 and 48 and responded to infusion of
    D10W. Enteral feeds were started on day of life #2 and
    gradually advanced to full volume. At the time of
    discharge, he is on 150 cc/kg/day of Neosure 24 calorie
    per ounce formula. He has poor p.o. intake. Weight on day
    of life #10, [**2168-8-19**], was 2.12 kilograms. Serum
    electrolytes were checked in the first week of life and
    were within normal limits.  He became transiently
    hypochloremic (Cl of 87)with the lasix.  This resoloved with
    the discontinuation of the lasix.  His most recent
    electrolytes were [**8-30**] Na 142 K 5.7 (hemolyzed)
    Cl 106 CO2 25 BUN 14 Cr 0.4.

1.  Infectious disease: Due to the unknown etiology of the
    initial respiratory distress and unknown group beta strep
    status of the mother, [**Name (NI) 13291**] was evaluated for sepsis upon
    admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. A complete
    blood count was within normal limits. A blood culture was
    obtained and was no growth at 48 hours. He was not
    treated with systemic antibiotics. On day of life 5,
    purulent eye drainage was noted. After an eye exam on
    [**2168-8-17**], he was diagnosed with bilateral blocked
    tear ducts. A 5 day course of erythromycin was started
    and it was completed on [**2168-8-21**].  He was treated the
    three doses of ampicillin around his hernia repair as
    prophalaxys because of his heart conditions.

1.  Hematological: Hematocrit at birth was 39.6%. [**Known lastname 13291**] did
    not receive any transfusions of blood products. His most
    recent labs were [**2168-8-30**] hct 31.6 PT 10.9 TPP 31
    INR 0.9 and plt 498.

1.  Gastrointestinal: [**Known lastname 13291**] required treatment for
    unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy. Peak
    serum bilirubin occurred on day of life 4, and totaled
    12.2 mg/deciliter. He received approximately 48 to 72
    hours of phototherapy. Rebound bilirubin most recently
    was on [**2168-8-18**], and was a total of 5.8 mg/deciliter.
    He developed a left inguinal hernia during the
    hospitalization. He had a hernia repair on [**2165-8-30**].
    He recovered from the procedure without incident.

1.  Neurological: A head ultrasound was performed on [**2168-8-12**], and showed asymmetric ventricles, left greater than
    right, and a small choroid cyst. A spinal ultrasound was
    also performed at that time due to the present skin tag
    and revealed a tethered cord with a fatty thylam and a
    hypoplastic sacrum. Spinal x-rays showed sacral
    dysgenesis of the lumbar segmentation and question also
    of cervical and thoracic abnormalities. Neurosurgery was
    consulted and [**Known lastname 13291**] will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 56743**]
    from [**Hospital3 1810**] in the myelodysplastic clinic,
    follow-up to be at 3 months of age. There will be further
    CT and MRI studies done that will be coordinated through
    that clinic in the future. Orthopedics was also consulted
    and follow-up will be through the multidisciplinary
    myelodysplastic clinic.  He had a repeat HUS on [**8-28**]
    which showed a persistent small choroid plexus cyst but
    assymetric ventricles had resolved.

1.  Genetics: Due to the constellation of physical findings
    and abnormalities, the genetics team was consulted
    through [**Hospital3 1810**]. Serum chromosomes were sent.
    There is a preliminary suggestive diagnosis of Goldenhar
    syndrome. Genetics follow-up will also be coordinated
    through the myelodysplastic clinic at [**Hospital1 62374**]. His Karyotype is 46 XY.

    GU: He was circumcised prior to discharge. It is well
    healed.

1.  Sensory: Hearing screening was passed prior to discharge.

1.  Ophthalmology: An ophthalmological exam was performed on
    [**2168-8-17**], and was within normal limits except for
    the blocked tear ducts as previously noted.

1.  Psychosocial:
