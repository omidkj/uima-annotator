1. Saccular infrarenal AAA up to 48 mm in diameter (400b:22). no

extravasation. focus of calcific irregularity along the right
aspect of the
aneurysmal sac is stable since the 6:18 reference examination.
2. Severe right femoralacetabular osteoarthritis.


Final Report
INDICATION:  AAA.

COMPARISON:  Reference CT is available from [**2172-5-13**] and [**7-21**], [**2174**].

TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired 2.5-mm axial images of the abdomen and
pelvis were
obtained prior to and following the uneventful administration of
90 cc of
Visipaque intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
reformations were
performed at 5-mm slice thickness.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:
Included views of the lung bases demonstrate mild dependent
atelectasis.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.  The heart size is
top normal.

The liver, stomach, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and
intra-abdominal
loops of small bowel are normal.  There is no mesenteric or
retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy, and no free air or free fluid.  The patient is
post left
colectomy with a right lower quadrant loop ileostomy, with no
evidence of
obstruction.  Extensive colonic diverticulosis is present, with
no evidence of
diverticulitis.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:
The rectum is normal.  No adnexal masses are present.  A Foley
catheter
resides within the bladder, containing a small amount of air
(3:40).  There is
no intrapelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:
There is no acute fracture.  Severe osteoarthritic changes are
seen within the
right femoroacetabular joint (3:131, 400B:23), where there is
complete loss of
joint space with extensive sclerosis and subchondral cystic
change. There are
no bony lesions concerning for malignancy or infection. Grade I
anterolisthesis of L4 over L5 is present.  There is loss of the
L5-S1 disc
space with vacuum phenomenon and posterior osteophytosis with
mild thecal sac
narrowing.

CTA:
A saccular infrarenal aortic aneurysm measures up to 48 mm in
diameter
(400B:22), measuring approximately 44 mm in length.  The
aneurysmal sac arises
from the right side of the aorta and demonstrates peripheral
coarse
calcifications, with focal area of calcific irregularity at the
lateral-most
edge (3:52), with no neighboring stranding to suggest an active
rupture.  The
appearance of the aneurysmal sac is unchanged in comparison to
the 8:19 p.m.
reference examination, but is markedly enlarged since [**2172-5-13**] reference
exam.  Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications extend throughout
the abdominal
aorta and iliac branches.

IMPRESSION:
1.  48-mm right saccular infrarenal AAA, markedly increased in
size since
[**2172**], with mild irregularity of the lateral-most calcific
borders placing this
at high risk for rupture. No active rupture is detected.
2.  Severe right femoroacetabular osteoarthritis.
3.  Post-left colectomy and right lower quadrant loop ileostomy,
with no
evidence of obstruction.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old female with a history of CAD, HTN, atrial
fibrillation, RBBB diverticulitis status post left colectomy
with loop ileostomy and oxygen-dependent
COPD on steroids who presented on [**2174-7-21**] with progressive
abdominal pain over the past few weeks.  She went to an outside
hospital where CT with oral contrast only demonstrated an
expansion of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that was
saccular in shape without an adequate neck for endovascular
repair. She was transferred to our hospital for further
evaluation where she was found to be hemodynamically stable.
However, she was complaining of significant pain and was
tender over her aneurysm. A CT angiography was obtained, despite
an elevated creatinine, that did demonstrate concerning
expansion of her aneurysm without any evidence of rupture.
However, it was felt with her progressive pain and tenderness
over the aneurysm and the saccular shape that she was at
incredibly high risk for imminent rupture. We therefore admitted
her for urgent repair of her juxtarenal
AAA. On HD 2 she underwent open retroperitoneal juxtarenal
abdominal aortic
aneurysm repair with tube graft which she tolerated well. For
full details of the procedure please see the operative report
dated [**2174-7-22**]. Postoperatively she was transferred in stable
condition to the CVICU on a ventilator. On POD #1 she was
extubated but required NIV for a short period. She was noted to
have a metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 2.3 and a WBC of 14
and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un)
