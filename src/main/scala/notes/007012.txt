Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Claudication

Catheterization
R IJ central venous line placement


History of Present Illness:
51 year-old female with PMH of CAD s/p CABGx4, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, s/p MVR and AVR, and severe PVD who presents
from home the day of admission for heparinization prior to a
planned intervention for worsening claudication. Ms. [**Known lastname 104253**]
has had severe claudication in the past and underwent a R SFA
atherectomy and angioplasty in [**5-/2179**] and stenting of the L SFA
total occlusion in 07/[**2178**]. She then underwent a CABG x4 and MVR
and AVR in 10/[**2178**]. Over the early winter months, she remained
asymptomatic from claudication, likely secondary to decreased
exertion. Approximately 1-2 months ago, she started to notice R
leg pain in the back of her calf with walking. It then
progressed to be rest pain. Then her L leg began to ache. It
progressed to the point where both posterior calves ache when
walking the length of a hallway. She is forced to stop and rest
for a few minutes before being able to continue walking. She
also has pains in the back of her calves at rest, like her legs
are falling asleep, at night. Despite the fact that her R leg
started first and that her R leg appears worse by recent ABIs,
her L leg is more painful to her and feels "tired" all the time.
She denies having any swelling in her feet (above her baseline -
her LLE has been slightly swollen ever since her CABG) or a cold
foot. Her feet remain warm and well perfused. There had been a
planned intervention at the end of [**1-/2180**] which she was
admitted for. However, her mother passed away and she was unable
to undergo the intervention. She was admitted for heparinization
in anticipation of an intervention planned for Wednesday. She
last took Coumadin on Friday night (2 days PTA) and her INR
today at home was 2.0.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains (other than chronic
hip/back pain), cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She does endorse
exertional calf pain, L>R. All of the other review of systems
were negative.

ECG Study Date of [**2180-3-5**]  6:29:32 PM
Sinus bradycardia
Right bundle branch block
Prolonged Q-Tc interval
ST-T wave changes may be in part primary
These findings are nonspecific but clinical correlation is
suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2179-9-26**], ST-T wave abnormalities
decreased
.
[**3-6**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate-sized extraperitoneal hematoma in pelvis, extending
mostly into the space of Retzius with small retroperitoneal
extension anterior to right psoas muscle. This is contiguous
with stranding in the right groin.
2. Small pleural effusion which demonstrates high Hounsfield
units greater than expected of simple pleural fluid. Hemothorax
cannot be excluded.
3. Tiny amount of blood anterior to liver.
4. Likely hematoma about newly placed right superficial femoral
artery stent. This study was performed without IV contrast. If
there is concern for pseudoaneurysm or extravasation about the
stent, femoral vascular ultrasound is recommended.
.
[**3-6**] Difficult Crossmatch
DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Ms. [**Known lastname 104253**] has a
new diagnosis of allo-antibodies to the E and K antigens. The E
and K antigens are members of the Rhesus and [**Doctor Last Name **] antigen blood
groups, respectively. Both of these antibodies are capable of
mediating hemolytic transfusion reactions. In the future, blood
transfusions for this patient should be restricted to ABO and
crossmatch compatible red cells that are negative for both E and
K antigens. Approximately 63% of ABO compatible blood will be
negative for both of these antigens. A wallet card and letter
stating the above will be sent to the patient.
.
[**3-6**] Peripheral atheterization
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Right lower extremity PVD as evidenced by moderate diffuse
disease of
the CFA and total occlusion of the SFA with distal flow
preservation via
the PFA.
2. Left lower extremity PVD as evidenced by origin stenosis
involving
the SFA and PFA.
3. Successful Sil
