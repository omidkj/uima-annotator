Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, Central Venous Access


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 75yo M with complex history, including CCU admission
[**Date range (1) 61041**] for NSTEMI c/b shock w/ IABP, intubation,
trach/[**Date range (1) 282**], and s/p medicine admission [**Date range (1) 61042**] with repeat
NSTEMI, trach replacement, removed 1 wk ago, now w/acute on
chronic dyspnea x 2d. He was in his USOH, living at home on 2L
NC O2 until 1 week ago when his prednisone was d/c'd, after
trach removal.  He gradually became dyspneic and on [**2183-7-25**] noted
inability to lie flat and marked PND.  He was brought to the ED
today where he was in moderate respiratory distress and was
transiently on BiPAP.  He was then weaned to 2L NC with O2 100%
after Bumex and Solumedrol.  ABG: 7.26/73/79, concerning for
hypercarbic respiratory failure.

60%, OM2 90%, OM1 80%, no intervention, dropped BP at end of
cath w/ PEA arrest---> resuscitated w/ epi/pressors

3. COPD on home Oxygen (2L for years) Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is pulm
fev1 590 cc by report- no pft's here
4. h/o pneumothorax
5. depression
6. IABP on last admit- was evaluated by CT surgery for CABG but
was thought not to be a surgical candidate given MMP
7. ARF on last admit - Cr 1.7, now 0.98

by IR (after 4 bleeding scans, c scope, push enteroscopy,etc)

EKG [**2183-7-27**]:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left axis deviation with
left anterior fascicular block. Right bundle-branch block.
Probable old inferior wall myocardial infarction. Lateral ST-T
wve changes which are non-specific. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2183-7-16**] no significant diagnostic change
.
CXR [**2183-7-27**]:
1. Interval increase of hazy opacities in the right upper lung
zone and right lower lung zone. These findings could represent
asymmetric CHF, but an infectious process cannot be excluded.
2. Cardiomegaly.
3. Interval removal of the tracheostomy tube. There is an area
of narrowing of the trachea, where the lumen is as narrow as 1
cm. This could reflect post intubation stenosis or edema.
4. Fibrotic changes of the lung and emphysema.
.
ECHO [**2183-7-29**]:
The left atrium is mildly elongated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with regional dysfunction including
hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum  and
anterior walls, apex, and distal inferior and lateral walls. The
remaining  segments contract well. The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated with  mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately  thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to
moderate  ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild-moderate pulmonary artery  systolic hypertension. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2183-6-9**], the
left
ventricular cavity is now dilated, moderate aortic valve
stenosis is now
identified. The right ventricle was mildly dilated with free
wall hypokinesis on review of the prior study.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory distress- Likely COPD and CHF exacerbation
worsened by rapid decrease in steroids.  Patient's hypercapnia
was attributed to chronic CO2 retention.  He was able to be
weaned off the ventilator back to NC oxygen, which he uses at
home, by the time of discharge.  He responded well to nebulizer
treatments and was restarted on steroids with a plan for a long
slow taper over the next few months.  At discharge patient was
on nasal canula and satting above 90. Continue fluticasone
inhaler, albuterol and atrovent nebs as outpatient.  And
continue PO steroids at 30 mg per day with slow taper down to 5
mg.  Patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2183-8-18**] for reassessment of his pulmonary function.

# CAD: Patient has known 3VD, last cath ([**4-29**]), no intervention
at that time given concurrent illness.  CABG unlikely given
severe COPD.  Continued ASA, BB, ACEi, and weaned Nitro gtt.  At
discharge BB was changed to Toprol XL 25 mg and Lisinopril
increased to 10 mg.  Pressures and HR stable.  Patient will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2183-8-14**].

# Pump: EF 35% on echo ([**5-29**]) with 1-2+MR.  Repeat ECHO from
this admission showed EF 35-40%.  Continue Ethacrynic Acid  25
mg daily as outpt.

# h/o GIB with gastritis and multiple polyps.  Continued on PPI
during hospitalization.

# Anemia - Patient received 1 unit of PRBCs during this
hospitalization.

# FEN: Electrolytes were repleted to maintain K>4, Mg>2.
Patient was advanced to a low sodium heart healthy diet.

# Prophylaxis - Patient was continued on PPI for gastric ulcer
prophylaxis and heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

# Code status: Patient clarified that he would like to be DNI
only, not DNR

# Dispo: Discharged to home with VNA and cardiac rehab.
