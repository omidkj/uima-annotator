Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
FEVER

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
79 year old male with a history of hypertension, type II DM,
systolic heart failure (with EF of 45%) and CVA ([**2101**],[**2121**]) with
residual right hemiplegia and dysarthria who is presenting with
fever from his nursing home.  He developed a fever to 104.  He
was brought to the ED for this reason.  In the ED, he was
tachycardic to the 140s, however this resolved after fluid
resuscitation.  A Foley was placed and frank pus was noted.  He
was also noted to be in acute renal failure with a creatinine of
2.0 compared to a baseline of 0.7.   Chest x-ray was
unremarkable.  Blood pressures were initially in the 90s
systolic but improved with fluid administration.  He was started
on broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, meropenem and flagyl)
given the frank pus and history of Clostridium difficile on
prior hospitalizations.  His vitals at time of transfer were:
temp 98.3, pulse of 97, respirations of 28, BP of 101/64, and O2
sat of 96% on RA.

He has a history of hypertension, type II DM, systolic heart
failure (with EF of 45%) and CVA ([**2101**],[**2121**]) with residual right
hemiplegia and dysarthria.  He had a prior hospitalization in
[**Month (only) 958**] after presenting with somnolence and found to have a left
sided pneumonia - he was started on levaquin and required
transfer to MICU where ; also in [**Month (only) 956**] of this year for a
clogged G-tube and IR replacement and in [**Month (only) 404**] for hypoxic
respiratory failure in setting of H. influenza pneumonia
complicated by an upper GI bleed from G-tube site and
Clostridium difficile infection.

At time of transfer, his vitals were normalized - his
temperature was 98, his heart rate was 90, SBP was 90/70, RR 12,
98% on RA.

Past Medical History:
1. multiple strokes: 1)old remote left frontal stroke in [**2101**]
that per NH notes purportedly left him with R-hemi and
dysarthria
(per son, able to think of words he wants to say and makes
grammatically intact sentences, but is often unintelligible)
2. DM2
3. HTN
4. Systolic heart failure with EF of 45%

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old male with a history of hypertension, type II DM,
systolic heart failure (with EF of 45%) and CVA ([**2101**],[**2121**]) with
severe residual right hemiplegia and dysarthria who presented
from his skilled nursing facility with VRE urosepsis.

1. VRE Urosepsis
2. Acute Kidney Injury
3. Hypotension
4. Hypernatremia
5. Decubitus ulcers

Chronic problems:
1. Type 2 diabetes.
2. S/P CVA

# VRE Urosepsis:  Mr [**Known lastname **] presented from rehab with high fever to
104, leukocytosis, tachycardia, tachypnea, with an indwelling
foley catheter. His foley catheter was removed and it was
grossly purulent.   He was initially started on vancomycin for
the possibility of enterococcus, along with meropenem for gram
negatives (he has a penicillin and cephalosporin allergy). He
continued to have low grade fevers and leukocytosis on the
vanc/meropenem combination. His urine cultures were finalized on
[**2124-3-31**] and were sensitive to ampicillin and linezolid. He has a
reported allergic history to penicillin. However, on review of
his medical records, he has received Unasyn for 3 days in the
past as well as augmentin for 3 days in the past without any
mention of adverse reaction. On the ampicillin, he has remained
afebrile for 48 hours and he is without leukocytosis. Given that
he has a complicated, catheter related urinary tract infection,
we are treating with ampicillin (500mg q6h via Gtube) for a two
week course, to end on [**2124-4-20**].

#Acute Kindey Injury: The patient was admitted with a serum Cr
of 2. This was most likley in the setting of dehydration,
hypovolemia, and urosepsis. He was given 2L IV fluids and his
hypotension as well as his serum creatinine improved to 1.3.
Over the duration of his hospital course as the patient was no
longer hypotensive or intravascularly depleted, his renal
function returned to his baseline of 0.8.

# Hypotension: Given his initial presentation of hypotension.
The patients metoprolol and hctz-triameterene were held. He has
not been hypertensive during this admission, therefore we
remained to hold these medications during inpatient
hospitalization.

#Hypernatremia: When the patient presented to the floor
