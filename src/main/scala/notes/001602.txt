Sulfonamides / Flagyl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness and productive cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Trach change, R IJ placement, L radial arterial line

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 y/o F with a past hx of asthma, COPD, OSA,
s/p recent long hospitalization for respiratory failure which
eventually required a trach who was admitted to [**Hospital3 25357**] on [**11-10**] with weakness and productive cough.  She
reports feeling well up until 2 days ago, when she noticed that
she felt weak and was having increasing shortness of breath.
She developed a productive cough at that time as well, with a
low-grade temp to the 99s.  She has had diminished appetite
since prior to her [**Month (only) **] hospitalization, and currently endorses
decreased po intake.  She denies chills, dysuria, chest pain, or
increasing pain at the site of her pressure ulcer.  She has not
noticed any increase in her peripheral edema.  She has not been
able to weigh herself every day, but she does report a possible
increase in sodium intake (although not more than her 2g/day
limit).
During her hospitalization (which began in [**2161-5-12**]), it was
felt that her respiratory failure was due to a combination of
COPD, LLL pna, and OSA (as she had been unable to reliably use
her Bipap while in the hospital).  She also has a hx of R sided
diastolic failure (cor pulmonale [**1-12**] long hx COPD/OSA), and was
diuresed with natrecor and bumex at that time.

Past Medical History:
1. CHF (R sided diastolic failure).  Last echo [**9-13**] showed
dilated LA, mild LVH, dilated RV with depressed RV fxn, [**12-12**]+MR,
2+TR, small pericardial effusion.  EF 50-55%
2. asthma
3. COPD FEV1 35%, FVC 38%, ratio 91%
4. OSA (on home BIPAP)
5. HTN
6. Afib
7. remote h/o colon ca at age 29, with partial colectomy
8. s/p trach placement [**2161-6-23**] by CT [**Doctor First Name **], followed by
interventional pulmonary here

Echo [**2161-11-13**]
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
7. Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2160-9-24**],
there has been
no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted from an OSH to the general medical
floors and started on azithromucin and ceftriaxone initially.
THe night of admission she developed hypostension and hypoxia.
She was transferred to the MICU on [**2161-11-12**] for this hypoxia and
hypotension. Her respiratory decompensation was thought to be
secondary to pneumonia given that she was having thick
secretions from her trach.

1. Hypoxia:  Given pt's low grade fever, leukocytosis, and new
productive cough, most likely diagnosis is pneumonia. SHe was
started on zosyn and vancomycin for a possible nosocomial
pneumonia. Her sputum was postive for pseudomonas. She required
ventilation via her trach to keep her oxygenation up. Initially
she required high FiO2 on the ventoilator to maintain
oxygenation. She was also treated with nebulizers and albuteral
inhalers prn and tiatroprium. She continued to produce white
sputum. On [**2161-11-17**] she tolerated being of the ventilator for 5
hours. On day of discharge she was tolerating being off the
ventilator and recieved supplemental oxygen via trach mask. Her
most recent ABG was 7.36/50/204 on FiO2 0.5, pressure support
ventilation 13/10 on [**2161-11-17**].

2. Hypotension: She was admitted to the MICU with systolic blood
pressures in the 90's. There was concern for sepsis as her
lactate was 3.7 and an elevated WBC at 23. She was given
intravenous fluids (5Liters on HD 2), stress dose steroids, and
started on neosynephrine to keep MAPS>65. She was then
transitioned to vasopressin and neosynephrine weaned off. She
also required levophed for a short period of time. Her lactate
levels decreased over several days. The vasopressin was weaned
off by [**2162-11-15**] and her blood pressure remianed stable.

3. Weakness/Electrolytes:  This was felt to be due to her
hypokalemia and respiratory decompensation.  She had Mg of 0.5
at outside hospital and was repleted on the ambulance ride over
here.  Her elctrolytes were repleted.

4. CHF:  Pt has not had Echo since [**11-13**], may have had
significant decline in EF given her extended hospitalization and
respiratory failure. Her echo showed and aef of 55% that was
unchanged from previous. She was diuresed with lasix
periodically and responded well once her blood pressure
stabilized.

5. ID: SHe was treated with zosyn for pneumonia. She was treated
with vancomycin as well for empiric coverage of gram postive
organisms. Her cultures never grew gram positives, so that was
discontinued on HD 7. She has been on po vancomycin since early
[**10-15**] for history of CDiff at [**Hospital3 **] (did not tolerate
Flagyl [**1-12**] rash).  We continued oral vancomycin and her c
difficile tests were negative here. She did have mild diarrhea
here. Her urine cultrue was negative and blood cultures remained
negative.

6. Endocrine: She was tre
