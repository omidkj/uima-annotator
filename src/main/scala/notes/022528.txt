History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year old male with PMH significant for
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and
current tobacco use with complaints of shortness of breath with
exertion and at rest. The patient had a positive stress test and
presented for cardiac catheterization in early [**2138-6-22**],
which revealed severe two vessel coronary artery disease. He
underwent evaluation at that time and was cleared to proceed
with surgical revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2138-7-14**] Intraop TEE:
PREBYPASS
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is hypokinesis of the
inferior, inferoseptal, and septal walls. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with normal free wall
contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are complex (mobile)
atheroma in the descending aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.

POSTBYPASS
The patient is A-paced on a phenylephrine infusion.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is preserved at an EF
of 45 - 50%, but the inferior and inferoseptal walls are now
near akinetic. Septal wall is hypokinetic. Lateral and anterior
walls have improved significantly.
Valvular function is unchanged.
Normal thoracic aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2138-7-14**] where the patient underwent Coronary
artery bypass grafting x2 with
left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior
descending and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending artery. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Over several days, he
continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis.  He was
discharged with creatinine at baseline on lasix x 10 days.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication. White blood cell count peaked at 16K and cultures
remained negative. By discharge, his white count decreased to
12.6 and he remained afebrile.  He was noted to have scant lower
pole sternal drainage with no click appreciated at the time of
discharge. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged 4 in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions.
