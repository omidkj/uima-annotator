Chief Complaint:
Worsening shortness of breath and edema

Intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year-old male with a history of refractory HF (EF
10%), CAD s/p CABG, AF s/p recent cardioversion, ICD, severe RA,
hyperlipidemia who presents for evaluation of worsening SOB and
edema. The pt was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] for
exacerbation of heart failure. Milirone was increased at that
time to 0.75mcg/kg/min and IV lasix drip was helpful for
diuresis. At home, he was receiving HCTZ 25mg prior to Lasix 40
mg IV in AM then oral Lasix in PM. [**Name (NI) 1094**] wife and [**Name (NI) 269**] noted the
pt to be more short of breath and edematous and called EMS. Pt
was taken to the nearest ED, and from there, pt was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] where he gets his usual care.

From OSH: BNP 2309 (1439 on [**8-18**])

EKG from OSH demonstrated A-V dual-paced rhythm with no
significant change compared with prior dated [**2156-8-22**].

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2156-8-22**] demonstrated:  The left
atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is
seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
thrombus is seen in the right atrial appendage The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets
which are mildly thickened. Aortic stenosis is present (not
quantified).

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2156-8-5**] demonstrated:
COMMENTS:
1.  Entry hemodynamics revealed top normal right sided filling
pressures with RVEDP of 9 mm Hg.  Mean PCWP was elevated at 17
mm Hg.  PASP was mildly elevated at 36 mm Hg.  Cardiac index was
depressed at 1.8 l/min/m2.
2.  Following milrinone infusion, right atrial pressure
decreased from mean 13 to 3 mm Hg).  PCWP decreased to 10 mm Hg.
 Cardiac index improved to 2.65 l/min/m2.
3.  Right internal jugular venous sheath and PA catheter were
secured by suture and dressed in sterile fashion.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Depressed cardiac index and elevated left sided filling
pressures.
2. Improved hemodynamics following milrinone infusion with
increased cardiac index, decreased right atrial pressure, and
decreased left sided filling pressures.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was a 69 yo M with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy wtih
EF of 20% s/p ICD placement, CAD s/p CABG, AF, hyperlipidemia,
and severe RA who presents with CHF exacerbation.
.
Congestive Heart Failure:  Pt had severe ischemic cardiomyopathy
with EF of 20%, NYHA class 4, on milrinone drip at home. He was
admitted with a CHF exacerbation, likely due to recurrence of
underlying atrial tachycardia. Patient had VTach shortly after
admission, and he was transferred to the CCU.  His Lasix and
Diruil were stopped.  He then became hypertensive with SBP 130s
and P 90s. He was restarted on his Lasix.  Patient had a VTach
arrest on [**9-11**], during which he vomited and was not protecting
his airway.  He was intubated on the floor. He was started on a
lidocaine gtt and was extubated shortly thereafter.  He then
developed a fever, thought to be secondary to aspiration
pneumonitis.  The patient was started on Levofloxacin and
Metronidazole for potential aspiration pneumonia, and he was
found to have a new RUL infiltrate on CXR.  The patient was
continued on this regimen until [**2156-9-13**], at which point he and
his family decided that he would be made CMO.  He passed away on
[**2156-9-13**] from cardiac arrest secondary to apnea.
