IMAGING:
CXR [**4-16**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions with possible mild vascular
congestion.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis or consolidation.

CT Ab/Pelvis [**4-16**] IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral atelectasis or consolidation, with small pleural
effusions.
2. Marked sigmoid distention up to 10 cm, likely secondary to
fecal
impaction, though other causes such as ischemia are not entirely
excluded.
3. Hepaticojejunostomy changes, with intact Roux-en-Y limb and
no evidence of
obstruction. Small amount of perihepatic free fluid,
non-specific.
4. Pancreatic cystic lesion most likely representing IPMN. If
clinically
appropriate, given patient age, could be further evaluated on
MRCP.
5. Diffuse atherosclerosis.

ECHO [**4-17**] The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). A mid-cavitary gradient is identified.
An apical intracavitary gradient is identified. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
function. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.5 cm2). No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main pulmonary
artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: no vegetations seen

[**4-18**] Renal U/S: IMPRESSION: Normal left kidney. Lower pole of
the right kidney could not be
adequately visualized on ultrasound, but no obvious
hydronephrosis seen.

[**4-18**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.

[**4-19**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Satisfactory position of peripherally inserted central venous
catheter
wire tip, although the distal floppy tip is obscured by
overlying cardiac
electrode.
2. Enlarging bilateral moderately large pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with dementia, HTN, h/o falls p/w fever to 103 and
bandemia in setting of UTI and fecal impaction, found to have
polymicrobial bacteremia and shock.
.
Briefly, patient was admitted with lethargy, hypoxia, fever,
elevated lactate and leukocytosis with bandemia, UA positive for
WBC and bacteria, and was also noted to have large fecal
impaction (not obstruction) on CT abd/pelvis.  She was started
on broad coverage for HCAP, UTI, and potential GI source
(including C.dif) with Vanc/Zosyn/Azithromycin/Flagyl.  CXR was
negative for acute lung process.  C.dif was negative, so Flagyl
was discontinued on HD3.  Non-contrast head CT was negative.
Urine cultures returned with GNR, further speciated on HD3 to
E.coli resistant to Zosyn, so patient was transitioned to
Ceftriaxone per sensitivities.  However, she also grew GPC
(streptococcus species) and GNR from [**Age over 90 **] cultures.  TTE was
negative for vegetations.  Episodes of hypotension, tachycardia,
hypoxia felt to be related to sepsis and general inflammatory
process with cytokine release.  For fecal impaction, attempted
Fleets enema, lactulose, soaps enema, mineral enema, manual
disimpaction, all without complete success.  GI consulted, but
no procedure indicated.  Developed progressive acute renal
failure, likely related to hypotension and hypovolemia, but
patient was aggressive hydrated but without benefit.  Multiple
discussions on goals of care were held with HCP (son), and
decision was made for comfort measures only on HD5. The patient
passed away peacefully on [**2204-4-21**] at 12:24PM.
