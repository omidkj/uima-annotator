with bovine valve.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year-old female
with known aortic stenosis who had been having more syncopal
spells and pre-syncopal spells recently.  She presented
preoperatively on [**2153-2-19**] for a preoperative cardiac
catheterization.  She has been otherwise without any
symptoms, except for her fainting spells.  She denies any
shortness of breath, chest pain, orthopnea, paroxysmal

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:  Positive for jugular venous
distention to approximately 5 cm bilaterally and a [**4-17**] AS
murmur that radiated to both carotid arteries.  She was
otherwise with clear lungs and no distal edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for hydration
prior to a cardiac catheterization on [**2152-2-20**].  She underwent
her catheterization on the 9th which showed significant
coronary artery disease.  There was, however, severe aortic
stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 0.6 cm
squared.  She had 3+ AI and normal ejection fraction of 65%.
She did have elevated right sided pressures with pulmonary PA
pressures of 50/20.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room the following day
where she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a #19
pericardial valve.  The patient did well during the operation
and came out of the operating room on a small amount of
Neo-Synephrine and on a propofol drip.  She did have a JP
placed underneath her pectoral muscle on the right, where
there was some use of this muscle to overlie her sternotomy
incision.  The patient did very well on the initial
postoperative course.  She was extubated on postoperative day

diuresed and started on Lopressor.  She was brought to the
floor on postoperative day #1 where she did very well with
physical therapy.

On postoperative day #3, the patient, early in the morning,
had new onset atrial fibrillation with a stable blood
pressure that was rate controlled with Lopressor.  She
converted back to sinus rhythm on her own and has been
maintained on po Lopressor which has kept her in sinus
rhythm.

By postoperative day #4, the patient was doing very well.
She was walking with physical therapy and her wires, chest
tubes and JPs had all been discontinued.  At this time, she
is scheduled for discharge pending completion of a level 5 of
