Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Central Line placement (Right internal jugular) in ICU-removed
at discharge
-[**2189-11-30**] Uncomplicated placement of a percutaneous GJ tube with
tip in jejunum. The T-fasteners will fall out on their own in
approximately six weeks. The tube should be changed
approximately every 3 months.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 42086**] is a 77M with a PMH s/f ogilvies syndrome with
frequent admissions for abdominal pain/distention, who was sent
to the emergency department when he complained of lower
abdominal pain at an outpatient ophthalmology appointment.
.
The patient is a difficult historian secondary to expressive
aphasia, but he is able to tell me that he has right upper
quadrant pain with associated nausea, and no vomiting. His last
bowel movement was in the emergency department. He also reports
three weeks of cough, denies sore throat, but does report
chills. Otherwise his review of systems is negative.
.
In the emergency department presenting vital signs were T=99.4,
BP=167/72, HR=93, RR=20, O2sat=99%RA. Per ED resident, his
abdominal examination was benign. Laboratory data was wnl,
though a lactate was not drawn. A CT of the abdomen showed
unchanged sigmoid dilation, consistent with his known Ogilvies
syndrome, with moderate fecal loading. A Surgical consultation
was obtained, and they assessed him to have no signs of ischemia
at this time. They recommended admission to medicine for serial
abdominal exams, rectal tube decompression, and GI consultation
for possible colonoscopic decompression. Of note, his CT showed
"concern for aspiration vs. pneumonia at lung bases". He was
given 750mg of levofloxacin.

Past Medical History:
#. Ogilvies Syndrome- Has frequent admissions for abdominal
distention, with dilated colon on imaging, which resolves with
rectal tube decompression.

IMAGING:
[**11-18**] CXR: No acute pneumonia.

[**11-18**] CT Abd/pelvis:
1. Unchanged, massively dilated sigmoid colon, with smooth taper
and a
fluid-filled rectum, compatible with pseudoobstruction ([**Last Name (un) **]
syndrome).
2. Unchanged marked fecal loading in the proximal colon.
3. Interval resolution of bilateral pleural effusions. Chronic
bibasilar
consolidations, suggestive of chronic aspiration.

[**11-20**] TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior
septum and distal anterior wall. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-8-17**], the findings are
similar.

[**11-20**] CT abd/pelvis:
1. Mildly dilated sigmoid and rectum without evidence of
obstructions; findings consistent with pseudoobstruction.
2. Stable bilateral consolidation at the lung bases, may
represent chronic aspirations

[**11-21**] Right UE ultrasound:
Right axillary vein could not be assessed due to arm
contracture. Right internal jugular, subclavian and brachial
veins patent, without evidence of thrombus.

[**11-22**] KUB:
Interval improvement in gaseous distention of bowel.

[**11-22**] CXR:
Limited study demonstrating streaky density at the right base
most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis.

[**2189-11-29**] KUB: In comparison with the study of [**11-22**], there is
some increase in the generalized dilatation of the colon with a
substantial amount of fecal material within it. The findings are
consistent with the clinical impression of colonic ileus.
Nasogastric tube extends to the upper stomach. Total hip
arthroplasties are again seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 42086**] is a 77M with a PMH s/f Ogilvies Syndrome, who
presents with abdominal pain
.
#. Abdominal pain/Ogilvies Syndrome:  Distention and abdominal
pain were consistent with prior episodes of Ogilvies. Initial
exam and CT were not concerning for an acute intra-abdominal
catastrophe. Rectal tube was placed, and bowel regimen given.
He continued to have profuse watery stools.  Shortly after
admission he had two episodes of vomitting guaic-positive
material.  He also developed a fever to 100.8.  In the context
of these changes, abdominal pain worsened over the first
hospital day, although abdominal exam remained benign.  Repeat
KUB demonstrated increased distention and possible volvulus.
Immediately after this was discovered he was briefly
hypotensive, as below.  He was given levofloxacin and
metronidazole empirically.  Surgery was consulted and
recommended serial exams and noncontrast CT abdomen when stable
to evaluate furthe
