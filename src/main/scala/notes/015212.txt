Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 36821**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service for
further management of her sternal wound infection.  Wound
cultures were obtained and she was empirically placed on
Vancomycin and Levaquin. The plastics service was consulted to
assist in the management of her sternal closure while the
Infectious Disease service was also consulted to assist in the
antimicrobial management of her wound infection. Given her
clinical signs, she was taken to the operating room the
following day for sternal debridement. She tolerated the
procedure and was brought to the CSRU fully sedated and
intubated. She remained intubated and sedated, and returned to
the operating room on [**2-28**] for additional sternal
debridement, with right rectus muscle flap and bilateral pec
advancement flap by the plastic surgery service. Several JP
drains were placed at that time. There were no complications and
she returned to the CSRU in stable condition. Over the next 24
hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated.
Antibiotics were continued. She maintained stable hemodynamics
and was intermittently transfused to maintain hematocrit near
30%. JP drainage was monitored closely and local wound care was
continued. A chest CT scan on [**3-2**] demonstrated
anterior and posterior soft tissue densities and bone
destruction consistent with osteomyelitis.  Wound cultures
eventually grew out polymicrobial organisms - Viridans
streptococci, Corynebacterium species, and Coagulase negative
Staphylococcus. Based on the above results, Flagyl was added to
her antibiotic regimen. She eventually transferred to the
cardiac surgical step down unit. She was noted to have
intermittent fevers and had a persistent leukocytosis. White
count peaked to 20K. C.diff was ruled out as a source of
fever/leukocytosis as several cultures were taken, all returning
negative. Blood cultures were also obtained, also negative. She
continued to be followed by the ID and Plastic surgery. Over
several days, several of the JP drains were removed. A PICC line
was placed without complication on [**3-6**]. Her fevers
eventually improved. It was felt she made steady progress and
was cleared for discharge to rehab on [**2131-3-15**]. Just
prior to discharge, it was recommended by the ID service to stop
Levaquin and continue only Vancomycin and Flagyl for four weeks.
At time of discharge, one JP drain remained in place. Her wound
appeared stable without signs of cellulitis. The staples will
need to remain in for approximately three weeks. She will follow
up with Plastics on [**2131-3-20**] and with followup with ID in [**Month (only) 958**].
She will also followup cardiac surgery in [**2-23**] weeks.
