CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and cough.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old woman with
end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease complaining
of shortness of breath and cough beginning [**2-24**].  The cough
is productive of thick clear sputum.  She is not sure if she
has a fever.  She is home O2 dependent and her baseline
exercise tolerance is extremely poor.  She reports becoming
very dyspneic after walking just ten feet.  She was admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation where she
received intravenous Solu-Medrol and after one day stated
that she felt much better.

On initial presentation to the Emergency Department, her O2
saturation was 87% on three liters of O2 with respiratory
rate 24 to 28.  Of note, on room air her baseline O2
saturation is only 81%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease dependent upon oral
    steroids; [**12/2144**] spirometry reveals FVC 71%, FEV1 34%,
    and FEV1/FVC of 48%.
2.  Right hip fracture in the past.
3.  Left hip pain.
4.  Crohn's Disease.
5.  Chronic anemia, transfusion dependent, probably
    myelodysplastic syndrome.
6.  Colonic polyps believed to be causing a chronic lower
    gastrointestinal bleed, but surgery has been deferred
    owing to her poor baseline nutritional and pulmonary
    status.
7.  Alcoholism:  She is currently an active drinker.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lasix 20 mg q. day.
2.  Combivent two puffs q. six hours.
3.  Prednisone 8 mg p.o. q. day (recently decreased from 10
    mg q. day).
4.  She has taken Flovent in the past but had stopped taking
    it because of cost.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Smoked two pack per day for 50 years.  Quit
about ten years ago.  The patient claims social ETOH,
although children state that she is an active alcoholic.
Currently retired.  Had worked several jobs as a writer
earlier in life and in real estate.  She lives alone in
[**Location (un) **].  Two children live nearby and occasionally visit.
Divorced times three times.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Has one bowel movement q. a.m.  Reports
that her Crohn's Disease has not caused her problems.
Complains of easy bruising secondary to taking Prednisone and
states that she has many bruises on her calves because of
collisions with her dog.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.1 F.; blood pressure
124/66; pulse 88; respiratory rate 24; O2 saturation 94% on
four liters.  In general, cachectic woman in no apparent
distress, breathing with retractions, labile, grandiose
affect.  Chest:  Prolonged expiratory phase with crackles at
baseline bilaterally, using accessory muscles prominently.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2.  No
murmur.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive
bowel sounds.  Extremities with no edema.  Purpura in lower
two-thirds of calves.

LABORATORY:  Sodium 133, potassium 4.2, chloride 91, CO2 32,
BUN 15, creatinine 0.5.  White blood cell count on [**12-17**], [**3-2**], [**3-3**], 30.3, 37.4, 46.8, 39.7.  Hematocrit
33.1.  Differential on [**2-28**], neutrophils 68, lymphs 6, monos
25; [**3-1**], neutrophils 81.3, lymphs 4.3, monos 11.9.
Platelets 130,000.

Urinalysis negative for urinary tract infection.  Arterial
blood gas on [**2-28**] at 5 p.m., 7.39/54/41/lactate 1.1.  Blood
cultures [**2145-2-28**], no growth to date as of [**2145-3-3**].

IMAGING STUDIES:  Chest x-ray with no evidence of acute
cardiopulmonary process.  Heart size is within normal limits.
 The left costophrenic angle is excluded.  There is a rounded
density at the right base which likely relates to diaphragm.
The lungs are otherwise clear.

IMPRESSION & PLAN:  77 year old woman with advanced chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease presenting with cough and
exacerbation of shortness of breath for a few days.
Differential diagnoses include:  Cardiac cause of acute
exacerbation (e.g., congestive heart failure), or infectious
versus non-infectious pulmonary cause.  Most likely, she has
a upper respiratory infection representing either a viral
upper respiratory infection or an atypical pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.      Pulmonary:  She remained in the Intensive Care Unit
for one day where she received 60 mg intravenous q. six hours
of Solu-Medrol.  She was stable on four liters of O2 and was
transferred to the Floor where intravenous steroids were
discontinued and she was started on 60 mg p.o. q. day of
Prednisone with Prednisone taper.  She was comfortable at
this setting, although she continued to complain of severe
dyspnea which she stated was her baseline.

She was coughing frequently and was given Robitussin DM as
well as Robitussin with codeine for symptomatic relief of her
cough.  She was started on Azithromycin while in the
Emergency Department and will finish up a five-day course of
Azithromycin.  She also received Albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizer treatments although she did not have evidence of
bronchospasm on examination.

On further discussion, the patient states that her baseline
exercise tolerance is so poor that she is unable to perform
basic functions such as getting from her bed at home to her
bathroom without becoming extremely dyspneic.  Given the
patient's extremely poor prognosis, she requested that she be
made a home Hospice candidate.

2.      Hematologic:  She has a persistently elevated white
blood cell count often to the low 20s, in the past.  Most
likely, this represents and effects both of the steroids that
she is taking and of a possible myelodysplastic syndrome.
Given that myelodysplastic syndrome is treated only
symptomatically with blood transfusions, no further work-up
is necessary at this time.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is a "DO NOT RESUSCITATE"/ "DO NOT
INTUBATE" given her extremely poor prognosis.  She wishes to
be made a Hospice candidate and she was therefore set up with
home Hospice through the [**First Name (Titles) 407**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
Network, at 1-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 12065**].  She will be seen by a Hospice
nurse on [**2145-3-4**].

In addition, she has an appointment in the Pulmonary/[**Hospital **]
Clinic with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 217**], on [**2145-3-17**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Viral pneumonia or atypical pneumonia or viral upper
    respiratory infection.
3.  Alcoholism.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Combivent two puffs inhaled four times a day.
2.  Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. day [**3-3**] until [**3-5**]; 30 mg
    p.o. q. day [**3-6**] until [**3-8**]; 20 mg p.o. q. day [**3-9**]
    until [**3-11**]; 10 mg p.o. q. day [**3-12**] thereafter.
3.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Azithromycin 250 mg p.o. q. day, stop on [**2145-3-5**].
5.  Robitussin DM 10 cc p.o. q. six hours p.r.n.
