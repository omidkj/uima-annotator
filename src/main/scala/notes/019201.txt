Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
left occipital mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**5-29**]: Left Craniotomy and resection of mass


History of Present Illness:
59 year old right handed man who presented recently to the BTC
for the evaluation of abnormal brain MRI findings.Patient
reported SOB on [**2177-4-15**] which prompted him to go to OSH where
chest x ray that showed a lung mass. confirmed by CT chest. On
[**2177-4-16**] he underwent a CT guided biopsy of lung mass and
pathology showed squamous cell carcinoma. He had a brain MRI on
[**2177-4-26**] which showed a contrast enhancing left occipital mass. He
denies any seizures, headaches, weakness, numbness or tingling.
The risks and benefits of undergoing surgical intervention were
discussed with the patient who now electively presents for a
craniotomy.


Past Medical History:
HL, COPD, b/l hip replacements

Social History:
Patient is married with 2 children. He smoked 1ppd for 20 years
but recently quit. He drinks occasionally. He denies any
recreational drugs use. He is currently unemployed

Family History:
non-contributory

Physical Exam:
Admission physical exam: no focal neuro deficits

Discharge physical exam:
-General: AAOx3, pleasant and conversant, NAD
-HEENT: occipital sutures C/D/I
-Neuro: AAOx3, CN II-XII grossly intact, strength 5/5 all
extrem, sensation intact


Pertinent Results:
[**2177-5-29**] Head CT without Contrast:  Expected post-surgical
changes after resection of left occipital lesion.

[**2177-5-29**] Brain MRI (pre-op): 2.1 x 1.6 x 1.7-cm lesion with
broad-based dural enhancing lesion with broad-based dural tail
within the left occipital lobe appears most consistent with
meningioma.

[**2177-5-30**] Brain MRI (post-op):
1. Post-surgical changes after resection of left occipital
lesion with blood prodcuts noted within the surgical bed as well
as adjacent extra-axial hematoma and mild adjacent soft tissue
hematoma. Pneumocephalus layering along the left frontal lobe
similar to the prior examination.
2. Mild enhancement in the upper surgical bed may represent
residual tumor.
3. Slow diffusion along the periphery of the surgical bed may
suggest post-op cytotoxic edema versus infarct. Attention to
these areas on followup imaging is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient electively presented and underwent a left occipital
craniotomy and resection of mass on [**2177-5-29**]. Surgery was
without complication and he tolerated it well. He was extubated
and transferred to the ICU. Post op Head CT on [**2177-5-29**] revealed
expected post-operative changes with no evidence of hemorrhage.

Patient's diet was advanced and foley removed.  He was started
on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
subsequently transferred to the floor in stable condition.  Head
MRI on [**2177-5-30**] demonstrated post-operative changes with
pneumocephalus of left frontal lobe, mild enhancement in upper
surgical bed which could represent residual tumor, and post-op
cytotoxic edema vs. infarct. Patient will follow up in brain
tumor clinic on [**2177-6-9**] for re-evaluation, particularly given
possible residual tumor post-operatively. He was discharged with
prescriptions for keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **], dexamethasone taper (4mg
TID x1 day -> 4mg BIDx1 day -> 4mg daily until brain tumor
clinic follow up), oxycodone, tylenol, and colace. Home ASA was
discontinued for now given no absolute need for med (stents etc)
and risk of bleeding.

post-operative office visit.
??????Make sure to continue to use your incentive spirometer while at
home.

We made the following changes to your medications:
1. STOPPED aspirin (increases risk of bleeding - please discuss
whether to restart this at your brain tumor clinic follow up)
2. INCREASED dexamethasone to 4mg three times daily for today
([**5-31**]), then two times daily tomorrow ([**6-1**]), then back to once
