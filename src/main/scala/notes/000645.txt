4. Status post CVA >10 yrs ago.
5. History of CHF with preserved EF
6. COPD- no PFTs in system
7. Hypertension

Social History:

heavy EtOH use in past (3+ drinks per day), quit 2-3 years ago.
No recreational drug use. Used to work in greenhouse supply
business, then sold real estate now disabled.

Family History:
Mother colon cancer. Father throat cancer,
brother died of colon cancer at age 62.


Physical Exam:
Gen- Sleeping in bed, mildly tachypnic.
VS: 98.3, 118/80, 75, 24, 93% 2L
HEENT- EOMI. R facial droop (old per pt). MM Dry.
Hrt- RRR. [**1-13**] SM at RLSB.
Lungs- [**Month (only) **] at R base, crackles, rhonchi R lung. Scattered exp
wheezes.
Abd- +BS, NT, ND, no palpable masses
Extrem- No c/c/e.

Pertinent Results:
[**11-17**] Renal US: RENAL ULTRASOUND:  Comparison is made with the
prior ultrasound dated [**2149-6-25**].  The right kidney measures
10.7 cm, the left kidney measures 11.2 cm, without evidence of
hydronephrosis, mass, or stone.
.
[**11-17**]: CXR: AP AND LATERAL CHEST:  There is consolidation in the
right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia.  The heart and
mediastinal contours are normal. The left lung is clear,
although there is underlying hyperinflation.  No pleural
effusions or pneumothoraces are seen.

IMPRESSION:  Consolidation in the right lower lobe is consistent
with
pneumonia.  Follow up radiographs should be obtained to document
resolution.

.
[**11-17**]: CT Chest w/o contrast: IMPRESSION:
1.  Limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
2.  Extensive soft tissue in the bronchus of the right lower
lobe, with post-
obstructive consolidation in the right lower lobe with effusion,
increased
since prior study dated [**2149-1-8**].  The endobronchial soft
tissue measures
30-40 [**Doctor Last Name **], and can represent protein-[**Doctor First Name **] mucus secretions.
However, in this
patient with history of heavy smoking and history of rectal
cancer, underlying
mass lesion such as  primary lung cancer or less likely
endobronchial
metastasis cannot be totally excluded.  Bronchoscopy is
recommended.
3.  Increased bilateral extensive peribronchial opacities,
probably related to
infectious or inflammatory condition.
4.  Unchanged dilated upper esophagus.
5.  Extensive coronary artery calcification.
6.  Unchanged low dense nodules in the thyroid gland.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo male with Type I DM, CKD-ARF, colorectal CA, new R lung
mass, COPD, CHF w/preserved EF who presents with SOB, cough and
fever.
.
#. Hyperglycemia: Pt w/Type I DM, w/known epsiodes of severe
hypoglycemia and DKA. Multifactorial process to account for
uncontrolled BS-inadequate insulin coverage per ED as well as
infectious process. No ketones in urine. Pt was treated with
Insulin gtt and then transitioned to sc insulin once anion gap
was closed. He was hydrated appropriately. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted
and help with management. His insulin regimen was changed to NPH
12U QAM and 3U of HUmalog with meals in addition to a sliding
scale.
.
#. ARF: Pt w/CKD due to longstanding Type I DM, now w/Cr 5.6 up
from baseline 2.1-2.4. Significant acidemia in setting of
worsening renal failure. Renal team was consulted. Renal U/S
normal, no postobstructive etiology to account for worsening
renal failure. No recent dye load or change in meds. Pt was
given Bicarbonate. Tunnelled cath was placed per Renal to
prepare for possible CVVH vs HD if becomes fluid overloaded
w/current management of hyperglycemia and worsening acidemia.
The patients ARF improved and he never required HD, therefore
tunneled line was pulled on the day of discharge. ACE-I was held
in the context of ARF on CRF.
.
#. Respiratory: New O2 requirement in setting of new R lung
mass, post obstructive PNA. Received 2 doses of levoflox and
flagyl per ED and floor team. Also h/o CHF w/preserved EF-no
current evidence of volume overload. In fact, appears
hypovolemic.
Pt was continued on Levo and will have to complete a 10 day
course. D/c flagyl. Pt contiuned to improve over next days and
had no more O2 reuirement on the day of discharge. The patient
will need a bronchoscopy for tissue dx of new mass as an
outpatient. Cultures of sputum were unrevealing.
.
#. UTI: Initial UA contaminant followed by +UA, Urine culture
negative. Continue coverage w/levofloxacin.
.
#. HTN: Pt well controlled on home regimen. ACE-I were held in
the setting of ARF on CRF. Pt was continued on short acting BB,
Hydralazine. Amlodipine was held initially because of concern
for early sepsis but was restarted before discharge. ACE-I
should be considered again once renal function stable.
.
#. Anemia- baseline Hct is 28/pt currently at baseline. Take
