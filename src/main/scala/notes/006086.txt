Pertinent Results:
CT abd/pelvic [**2100-7-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right posterior bladder diverticulum containing regions
of hyperdensity has increased in size when compared to prior
exam. Foci of air within the bladder and within a diverticulum
may be due to recent catheterization, although infectious /
fungal process should be considered.
2. Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
3. Interval increase in bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
4. Diffuse anasarca and small amount of perihepatic fluid
identified.
.
[**2100-7-5**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing left-sided
pleural effusion has slightly increased in extent. Newly
appeared is a small
right-sided pleural effusion that contributes to a decrease in
transparency of
the right lower lung. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with
moderate signs of
overhydration, the interstitial aspect of this overhydration is
now more
obvious than on the previous film. Otherwise, no interval
changes.
.
[**2100-7-3**] CT chest:
FINDINGS: The visualized osseous and soft tissue structures are
within normal limits.

There is a pacemaker with wires intact.

There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right. There is adjacent passive atelectasis predominantly
involving the bases of the lungs. The central tracheobronchial
tree is patent. There is no pulmonary parenchymal consolidation.


There are atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta
and coronary arteries. There is no aortic aneurysm.

Evaluation of the upper abdominal viscera is limited by
intravenous contrast. The visualized portions of the liver,
spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas are within normal limits.
The upper poles of the right and left kidneys appear normal.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than
right with adjacent atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT:88M with h/o CVA, recent PNA and recurrent UTIs with
fungal bladder mass and indwelling foley presenting with low
grade fevers, vomiting, leukocytosis and bandemia, fluid
responsive hypotension. Pt. improved on course of cefepime
transitioned to ceftrioxone for a total of 14 days.
.
Brief hospital course: 88 yo M w/ MMP presents with urosepsis
with E.coli UTI. Initially admitted to the ICU then transitioned
to the floor in stable condition. Followed by urology for
bladder mass.
.
## Sepsis: The pt met sepsis criteria with multiple possible
infectious sources, elevated WBC count and temp. His shock
reversed after fluid resuscitation. Possible sources for
infection were thought to included HAP, UTI or C.Diff. Of these,
a UTI seemed most likely given the pt's history; on HD1 [**12-21**] BC
bottles were positive for GNRs, which was thought to further
comfirm this hypothesis. The pt's antimicrobial coverage was
changed to cefepime and vancomycin; although diflucan was
included initially for fungal coverage, this was stopped when
the pt's blood cultures became positive. He defervesed and
remained HD stable for the remainder of his course in the MICU.
Pts. antibiotics were tailored per sensitivities of urine cx.
which grew e.coli sensitive to cefepime and ceftrioxone. He is
to complete a 14 day course of antibiotics. Following this he
will be transitioned to prophylaxis with ongoing nitrofurantoin.

.
## h/o fungal mass in bladder: Urology was consulted. Repeat
imaging of the pelvis was advised and a urine cytology was sent.
A repeat CT abd/pelvis showed increasing size of the
hyperdensity in the bladder diverticulum as compared to prior
imaging. Urology was following the patient and will likely
attempt a second cystoscopy as an outpatient. They also advised
that he will need a chronic foley and it will need to be changed
once per month.
.
## CAD: The pt has a h/o HCF with 30-40% EF in [**2091**]. The pt's
slight troponin leak in the setting of flat CKs and no CP was
thought unlikely to present ACS. ECG unchanged (intermittent AF
with v-pacing). A ROMI was completed. The pt's home Lasix, [**Year (4 digits) **]
and BB were held while he was hypotensive.  His blood pressure
improved and he was restarted on his home medications.
.
## HTN: As above, the pt's BB and [**Year (4 digits) **] were held while he was
hypotensive. Then restarted.
.
## DM2:  Metformin was held and the pt was covered with an ISS.
metformin can be restarted as an outpatient.
.
## h/o dysphagia: The pt was kept NPO except meds/sips and a
speech/swallow eval was obtained. Speech and swallow evaluated
the patient and he tolerated a po diet with modifications.
.
## CVA: [**Year (4 digits) **] and Coumadin were continued. His INR was elevated
likely [**12-19**] to medication interaction. He was dosed per INR.
.
## AF: The pt is s/p PPM placement. His home coumadin was
continued.
