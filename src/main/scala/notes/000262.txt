History of Present Illness:
This is a 49 year-old male with history of diabetes,
hypertension, and end stage renal disease who was transfered
from an outside hospital after a PEA arrest.  For the past week,
he has been feeling unwell.  One week ago, he underwent
placement of a perotoneal dialysis catheter.  At that time, he
required hospital admission for 2 days due to hyperkalemia and
hyperglycemia.  He was not dialysed at that time.  He had
persistent nausea.  The day prior to admission, he was back to
his baseline health, which is severe fatigue with ambulation of
a few yards.  The morning of presentation, he began to feel
nauseated.  Per report, he fell from his chair and was
unresponsive.  He had some jerking movements of his arms that
were similar to his hypoglycemic episodes.  Shortly thereafter,
he was responsive but then became unresponsive again.  When EMS
arrived, he was found to be bradycardic in PEA arrest.  He
received epi and atropine.  He subsequently became hypotensive
to the 60s systolic and was asystolic.  He was transcutaneously
paced.  He was taken to an outside hospital where he continued
to be hypotensive.  He received 4 L of IV fluid resuscitation.
A temporary pacer was placed, and he was paced at 80 beats per
minute.  Without pacing, he had only rare junctional escape
beats.  His labs were notable for hyperkalemia to 6.2,
hyperglycemia to the 700s, and acidemia with a pH of 7.03.
Cardiac enzymes were negative and his BNP was elevated to [**2175**].
An echocardiogram revealed an EF of 15-20% with global
hypokinesis and decreased right ventricular function.  He was
transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  On transfer,
his vent settings were noted to be incorrect and he was found to
be hypoxic to the 50s on 2 separate gases about 1.5 hours apart.
 On arrival he was oxygenating well.  He was on 5 mcg of
levophed to maintain his blood pressure.  He was intially
unresponsive, with fixed dilated pupils, with an absent corneal
and gag reflex.  An initial potassium was 6.4.  He received
calcium, bicarb, insulin, and kayexelate.  He was admitted to
the CCU.

Past Medical History:
1. Insulin dependant diabetes diagnosed 20 years ago.
2. End stage renal disease for about 1.5 years with plans to
start perironeal dialysis next month.  A PD catheter was placed
last week.
3. Hypertension
4. Hyperlipidemia
5. History of lens removal in left eye.
6. History of TIA


Social History:
He is currently not working.  He is married and has 2 children.
He smokes 1 pack per day.  He doesn't drink alcohol.

Family History:
His mother has a triple bypass in her 60s.  She also has
diabetes and hypertension.


Physical Exam:

gallops.

nondistended, healing surgical incision.
Extremities: Cool to touch, 2+ radilal and dorsalis pedis
pulses.  Left cortis dressing intact.

extremities.


Pertinent Results:
Outside Hospital:
1. Chest x-ray: Cardiomegally, pacer wires coiled in the right
ventricle, pulmonary edema, widened mediastinum.
2. Head CT: Negative for acute bleed or mass effect.
3. Echocardiogram: EF 15-20% with global hypokinesis.  Decreased
right ventricular systolic function.
.
[**Hospital1 18**]:
1. Chest x-ray: Cardiomegally, pacer wires coiled in right
ventricle, widened mediastinum, pulmonary edema.
2. Chest CTA: No pulmonary emboli, no aortic dissection,
pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions, coronary
arteries grossly clean.
.
EKG: Ventricular paced at 80 bpm with left bundle morphology.
EKG with underlying rhythm: narrow complex escape beats at
50-60.
.
TTE [**2182-5-21**]:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed. LVEF 40% Distal
anterior, apical, and distal inferior hypokinesis is present.
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. There is a small pericardial effusion.

Exercise stress test: [**2182-5-22**]
The baseline EKG showed prominant voltage, diffuse STT wave
abnormalities and LAE. No additional, significant ST segment
changes
over baseline were observed during the infusion or in recovery.
The
rhythm was sinus with no ectopy. Appropriate blood pressure
response to
the infusion; blunted heart rate response. The dipyridamole was
reversed with 125 mg of aminophylline IV.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or significant EKG changes
over
baseline. Nuclear report sent separately.

PERSANTINE MIBI  [**2182-5-22**]
RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
3.1 mCi Tl-201 Thallous Chloride;
21.0 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi;
HISTORY: Diabetes, ESRD, and hypertension, status post
hyperkalemia-related cardiac arrest. CAD evaluation.
SUMMARY OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORT FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:
Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose
of 0.142
milligram/kilogram/min. Two minutes after the cessation of
infusion, Tc-99m
sestamibi was administered IV.
INTERPRETATION:
Image Protocol: Gated SPECT
Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting
images.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial
perfusion model.

The image quality is adequate.

Left ventricular cavity size is dilated, and more dilated at
stress than at
rest.

Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake
throughout the
myocardium.

Gated images reveal diffuse hypokinesis without focal wall
motion abnormalities.The calculated left ventricular ejection
fraction is 48%

IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Transient
dilitation of the left ventricle during dipyridamole (stress)
images compared to rest, with a
baseline dilated left ventricle.


Brief Hospital Course:
49 year-old male with diabetes, end-stage renal disease,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia admitted with cardiac arrest likely
secondary to hyperkalemia and acidemia.
.
1. Cardiac arrest: Patient had an asystolic arrest in the
setting of hyperkalemia to 6.4 and acidemia to 7.0.  On arrival,
he was 100% paced with an underlying rhythm of 50-60s junctional
escapes.  He was also hypotensive requiring Levophed.  He was
treated for hyperkalemia in the emergency department with
calcium gluconate, bicarb, insulin, and Kayexalate.  His mental
status improved with treatment of hyperkalemia.  His EKG with
back-up pacing at a rate of 40 showed heart block with
occasional conducted beats with AV delay.  There was also some
inappropriate pacing spikes.  The sensing was decreased with
good effect.  He subsequently converted to normal sinus rhythm
without AV delay as his potassium was corrected.  His blood
pressure also improved with treatment of his hyperkalemia.  He
is currently off of Levophed. Patient had a repeat TTE which
demonstrated an improvement in his EF to 40%. Temporary pacer
was discontinued on [**2182-5-20**]. Patient did not have further
evidence of arrythmia. He will have close follow-up locally and
he will have his PCP refer him to a local cardiologist.
.
2. Chronic renal failure: secondary to diabetes and
hypertension. At the OSH the patient had a catheter placed with
the goal of starting peritoneal dialysis in 1 month. However,
during that hospitalization, he then developed
