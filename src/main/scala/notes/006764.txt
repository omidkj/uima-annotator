Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:
Pt is a 68 y.o female with h.o MM, anxiety/depression,
hypothyroidism, asthma, GERD, LBP, CKD who was transferred from
[**Hospital1 1501**] with hypotension.
.
#hypotension-likely related to hypovolemia. No fever or
leukocytosis, but infection such as UTI is a possibility. CXR
negative for PNA, no GI symptoms. Other possibilities considered
included acute blood loss, but HCT appeared similiar to prior,
was stable, and there were no current signs of active bleeding.
Also considered cardiac causes, but EKG unchanged from prior and
did not have any cardiac symptoms. Pt felt clinically well
during admission and there were no further episodes of
hypotension. Pt's oxybutynin was held during admission. Case
discussed with gyn as pt has recently underwent a urogyn
procedure. It was not thought that this procedure ~1month ago
was related to current presentation and HCT was stable, not
suggestive of bleeding. BCX were NGTD. UCX grew contaminated,
but pt did have symptoms of urinary hesitancy prior to admission
and clinically improved with antibiotic therapy and IV fluids.
Considered need for TSH and/or [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim but hypotension was not
present during admission.
.
#urinary tract infection/recent urogynecology
procedure-complicated-pt with urinary hesitancy, but no dysuria.
UCX contaminated. Pt was given IV ceftriaxone empirically while
awaiting culture. This was changed to PO cipro. Pt should
complete a 10 day total course of therapy. 7 more days after
discharge.
-Pt has f/u already scheduled with her urogyn for continued
post-op monitoring. See below.
.
#Bipolar disorder-continued venlafaxine, gabapentin, clozapime,
clonazepam
.
#CKD-stage III, baseline 1.2-1.4, presented at 1.4. Improved to
1.1 on day of discharge. Monitor Cr levels upon discharge.
.
#smoldering multiple myeloma-followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**], stable.
Possibly the cause of chronic LBP, hypercalcemia and anemia. Pt
has an appointment scheduled for follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] after
discharge for continued care
.
#lower back pain-pt states chronic and has had for some time.
Denies any associated neurologic symptoms. Reports that she does
not usually take any thing for pain. Could be due to MM vs. DJD.
No fever, leukocytosis or acuity to suggest infection. Pt was
given tylenol and tramadol prn (home regimen). She was offered a
lidocaine patch as well.
.
#hypercalcemia-likely a result of Multiple myeloma. Outpt follow
scheduled. Pt should have monitoring of her calcium levels upon
discharge.
.
#hypothyroidism-continued levothyroxine
.
#GERD-continued PP
