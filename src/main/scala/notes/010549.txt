Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2138-7-29**] Aortic Valve Replacement(19mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Porcine Valve) and
Two Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(LIMA to LAD, SVG to
PDA).


History of Present Illness:
This is a 84 year old female with known aortic stenosis who
presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion.  Cardiac
catheterization in [**2138-7-21**] showed severe two vessel
coronary artery disease(70% lesions in the RCA and LAD). Given
her aortic stenosis and obstructive coronary disease, she was
referred for cardiac surgical intervention.

Social History:
Denies tobacco and ETOH.
Lives alone.

Family History:
Mother died of "heart attack" at age 68

Physical Exam:
SR @ 88 BPM, bp 130/50, rr 16. Wt 58.9kg (v. 53 preop)
general: elderly female in NAD, severe kyphosis
skin: unremarkable
heent: oropharynx benign
neck: supple, no jvd
lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally
heart: regular rate and rhythm, crisp heart sounds. SR @60bpm
Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended. well healed midline scar
Ext: warm, trace edema bilaterally
Neuro: alert and oriented
Sternum stable, wounds clean and dry

Pertinent Results:
[**2138-7-29**] Intraop TEE: PREBYPASS
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mod to severe (3+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
5. There is no pericardial effusion.
6. Left ventricular function is low normal at 50%. No segmental
wall motion abnormalities.
[**2138-7-29**] Intraop TEE: POSTBYPASS
1. Pt is on phenylephrine infusion
2. A large perivalvular leak is seen, around an aortic prostetic
valve causing moderate aortic insufficiency.
3. Aortic contour is smooth after decannulation
4. Wall motion remains unchanged with EF 50%
[**2138-8-4**] Postop TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to the tachycardia, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. A well-seated
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present with normal
gradient. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**11-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 15716**] was admitted and underwent an aortic valve
replacement & coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. For
surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative note.
Following the operation, she was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. Beta blockers were
begun as were diuretics. Her CVICU course was otherwise
uneventful and she transferred to the SDU on postoperative day
two.

On postoperative day three, she developed rapid atrial
fibrillation which was initially treated with Amiodarone
infusion. Due to significant conversion pauses(which were
asymptomatic), Amiodarone was stopped and switched to Diltiazem
for rate control. However with conversion back to normal sinus
rhythm, she developed symptomatic bradycardia and required
transfer back to the CVICU.

She was started on Epinephrine and required pacing via
epicardial leads. The EP service was consulted and recommended
low dose PO Amiodarone to maintain normal sinus rhythm. Over
several days, her heart rate stabilized. She remained in a
normal sinus rhythm and tolerated PO Amiodarone. She was
transferred back to the SDU on postoperative day five. Despite
medical therapy, she continued to experience paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and was eventually started on low dose Warfarin
with goal INR around 1.5-2.0. Beta blockade was slowly advanced,
and no further conversion pauses were noted. Ms. [**Known lastname 15716**] was
treated with ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection. The
patient remained in sinus rhythm.  She was transferred to an
extended care facility on POD 14  for further recovery and
physical therapy. Of note, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her primary care physician
was following her coumadin dosing prior to surgery however Ms.
[**Known lastname 15716**] has informed us that Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6955**] will be taking
over as her primary care physician. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 6955**] can follow her
coumadin dosing for a goal INR of 1.5-2.0 when discharged from
rehabilition. His office should be notified when discharged from
rehab to resume coumadin dosing as an outpatient.
 Surgical staples had been removed.
