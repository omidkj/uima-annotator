CT head
Wet Read Audit # 2 MLHh FRI [**2155-4-11**] 3:14 PM
Markedly inc size of L thal hemorrhage, 6.8 x 4.5 cm, prev 2.7 x
2.0 cm.
Increased mass effect and IVH, increasing hydrocephalus.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 year old man with a h/o HTN, presents with abrupt onset of
right sided weakness, somnolence in setting of alcohol
intoxication.  He was found to have a large left thalamic
hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.  Repeat head Ct
shows significant increase in size of bleed with early
development of hydrocephalus.  The patient was admitted to the
neuro ICU.  A neurosurgery consult was requested and treatment
options were discussed with the family.  Given the progression
of the bleed, poor exam and extremely poor pronosis, it was
thought that the patient would not benefit from surgical
intervention.  The patient was extubated and made comfort
measures only after discussions with his family. He died shortly
after.
