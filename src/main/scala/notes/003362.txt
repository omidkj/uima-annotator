Attending:[**Last Name (un) 7835**]
Chief Complaint:
cardiac arrest


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation (presented intubated)
Central Venous Line placement (Right IJ)
Arterial Line Placement


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with afib not on anticoagulation, CAD, DM,
HTN, CHF, CKD presenting from OSH with cardiac arrest.  She was
recently admitted to OSH in [**Month (only) 956**] for GI bleed and discharged
to rehab and recently discharged back home where she had been
doing well for a month.  On day prior to admission at OSH, she
was noted to have altered mental status with slurred speech.  CT
head was reportedly negative.  In the ED she was noted to have
long pauses greater than >25sec at its worst with associated
syncope.  She was evaluated by cardiology; metoprolol and
digoxin were stopped and pacemaker was placed for sick sinus
syndrome.  Infectious work-up revealed enterococcal UTI that was
sensitive to vancomycin.  She was initially on levofloxacin and
later on vanc/zosyn prior to transfer.  One blood culture also
grew GPCs in clusters for which ID was consulted.  Given that
she was afebrile and without leukocytosis, ID felt that this may
be contaminant and recommended that vancomycin be discontinued
until speciation of the GPCs.  This was ultimately speciated to
coag neg staph. Hospital course was further complicated by acute
on chronic renal failure, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status,
urinary retention (for which bethanechol and tamsulosin were
started) and hypoglycemia (sugars 50s).
.
Pt was being evaluated by PT for transfer to rehab when she was
found nonresponsive and pulseless on night prior to transfer.
She was not on telemetry at that time.  She had VT/Vfib and
defibrillated 4 times, given epinephrine, intubated, and placed
on ventilator.  She was transferred to CCU and started on
vasopressors, levophed and dopamine.  She was broadly cultured
and placed on vanc/zosyn and right IJ was placed.  She was
weaned off levophed with IVFs but still on dopamine at transfer.
 A CXR showed left sided consolidation.  She was given 150mg
amiodarone and placed on amiodarone drip.  Cooling protocol was
not initiated due to fact she was opening her eyes and moving
all extremities.  TTE was performed; results still pending by
time of discharge.  Last TTE from [**2191-2-28**] had shown EF 55-60%,
mild concentric LVH, and mild pulm art HTN.
