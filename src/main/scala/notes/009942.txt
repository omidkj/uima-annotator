Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old female with past medical history of
hypertension presents with 2-3 hours of shortness of breath. She
reported approximately 1 week of sore throat, myalgias,
decreased appetite and PO intake. She also reports that she
hasn't had a bowel movement in 1.5 weeks. Per discussion with
patient, review of EMS and ED notes, she has had dizziness, sore
throat, and generalized weekness for a few weeks. It was
reported that her room air oxygenation was 53% upon arrival of
EMS.
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were temperature of 97.9, blood
pressure of 121/58, respiratory rate of 30, and 96% on 100% NRB.
A chest x-ray demonstrated diffuse hazy opacities in all lung
fields without definite consolidation.  She was given 20mg IV
lasix, nitroglycerin, 1 gram of ceftriaxone and 500 mg of
levofloxacin, along with 25 mg of benadryl.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] patient reports that her breathing is
"okay." She denies any chest pain.  She denies any leg swelling,
leg pain, weight gain. She endorses a couple pound purposeful
weight loss. No hemoptysis or hematuria. No dysuria or GI
symptoms aside from constipation.
.
Review of sytems:

Physical Exam:
Vitals: Temperature 101.4, Heart rate 73, Blood pressure 132/53,
Respiratory rate: 23, Oxygen saturation: 88% on NRB
General: Alert, oriented, using accessory muscles
intermittently, appears to be in mild respiratory distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry mucous membranes
Neck: Supple, JVP difficult to assess but does not appear
elevated, no LAD
Lungs: Bilateral rales throughout all lung fields, no wheezes,
scattered ronchi
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: Foley in place
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis. Mild
bilateral edema present


Pertinent Results:
TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal septal
hypokinesis. The overall LVEF is preserved. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with borderline free wall contractility. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. At least moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
glaucoma, and possible asthma who presents with subjective
fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress.
.
#) Respiratory distress: Patient was intubated on [**8-9**] for
respiratory distress of unclear etiology, during her course in
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] multiple causes were explored.  Differential remained
broad with the most likely cause being acute respiratory
distress syndrome. Prior to admission she described a prodrome
lasting a few weeks, with acute onset of shortness of breath the
day of presentation. She was worked up for multiple infectious
causes, all of which were negative.  She was treated empirically
with broad spectrum antibiotics and anti-virals to treat
influenza.  She was also worked up for vasculitis and possible
hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  As her course progressed the
picture seemed most consistent ARDS, she was treated with
steroids, however she did not respond.  As she was nearing 14
days of intubation, the subject of tracheostomy was broached
with the family, who ultimately decided that she would not have
wanted a trach, so she was make comfort measures only,
extubated, started on a morphine drip, and ultimately passed
away on [**2159-8-22**].
.
#) Sepsis: patient became septic during her initial course,
requiring blood pressure support with pressors.  Given her
presentation a pulmonary source of infection was favored, her
blood and urine cultures remained negative.  On [**8-16**] she was
able to be weaned from pressors.
.
#) Acute renal failure: Initially concern for a pre-renal cause
based on her Fena vs. hypoperfusion due to her hypotension.
Patient had muddy brown casts in her urine, making ATN likely in
the setting of hypotension. There was also some concern, that in
the setting of ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, that she may have
pulmonary ??????renal syndrome/vasculitis. Her anemia and [**Doctor First Name **]
positivity were both supportive, however she was ANCA negative.
Her Cr started to trend down, given the interval improvement,
ATN was the most likely diagnosis.
.
#) Anemia: Unknown baseline HCT, no hemoptysis to suggest DAH.
Guaiaced stools, check iron studies, B12, folate, patient had no
signs of active bleeding during her course.  Patient was
transfused during her hospital course, with appropriate
responses in HCT to transfusion.
