Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
76 yoF w/ complex PMHx including CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, DM,
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, sarcoidosis w/ pulmonary
involvement, COPD on home O2 at night, diastolic CHF, PAF on
coumadin who presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] this am for generalized
weakness. Patient awoke this am feeling generalized weakness.
Prior to this she had been in her usual state of health.  She
went to dialysis yesterday and may have had a lot of volume
taken off but is unsure.  Following HD, she felt fine.  This am
she awoke with generalized weakness. She also noted mild SOB.
Her FSBG was normal. She denied and fever, chills, cough, chest
pain, or any other complaints. She checked her BP at home and it
was low so went to hospital. At [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**], she was found to be
tachycardic to the 120s in AF and hypotensive w/ SBP in 90s.
She received IV lopressor which dropped her SBP to 80s.  She
received 1L of NS at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] without significant improvement
in her BP so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, T 96.6, BP 102/59, HR 119, RR 15, O2 80% RA->100%
on 3LNC. Found to be hypoglycemic to 39 and received 1 amp of
D50. She received 10 mg of IV dilt which dropped her SBPs to 70s
and HRs to 70s, then 50s.  She received an additional 2L NS with
SBPs to 80s-90s.  She received a bedside u/s which showed no
pericardial effusion but a large RA. There was some concern that
her noninvasive BP measurements were inaccurate given her
nephrogenic systemic sclerosis and an a line placement was
attempted without success. During attempted placement, patient
became transiently bradycardic to the 30-40s and was
unresponsive for 3-5 seconds but awoke w/ improved HR.  Except
for transient presyncope, patient continued to mentate
throughout ED admission. She noted that her breathing felt
better than this am. Cardiac enzymes were checked and CKs were
flat.  Trop mildly elevated but unchanged from baseline and from
level at [**Location (un) 620**].
.
Upon arrival to MICU, patient feeling well.  Notes she is
feeling back to normal self except that she is ready for sleep.
No longer notes generalized weakness.  Denies fever, chills,
chest pain, abdominal pain.  She notes her breathing has
improved over the course of the day.

NEURO: A&Ox3. Appropriate. CN 2-12 grossly intact. Preserved
sensation throughout. Symmetric strength.

Pertinent Results:
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There are bilateral
small pleural effusions, which are chronic. The cardiomegaly has
improved. Increased interstitial markings are due to combination
of edema and underlying known pulmonary sarcoidosis, There is no
focal consolidation.

Tip of one dual chamber right supraclavicular central venous
line projects over the lower SVC and superior cavoatrial
junction. There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial edema, improved. Chronic increased
pulmonary markings consistent with known sarcoidosis

Brief Hospital Course:
76 yoF w/ CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, DM, nephrogenic systemic
fibrosis, sarcoidosis w/ pulmonary involvement, COPD on home O2
at night, diastolic CHF, PAF on coumadin who presented with
weakness and was found to be tachycardic and mildly hypotensive
following recent HD, now admitted to the MICU for persistent
hypotension in the setting of nodal medications.
.
# hypotension: patient has a h/o hypotension following HD and
typically receives midodrine. Likely secondary to volume
depletion initially from HD and then medication induced [**3-7**]
metoprolol and diltiazem.  Now volume repleted. Also question of
whether noninvasive measurements are accurate given her h/o
nephrogenci systemic sclerosis. Upon arrival to the MICU,
patient's SBPs were in the 90s but was mentating clearly.  No
further interventions were made and she remained stable.  Her
HRs remained in the 50s.  The following mornings, HRs had
increased as had blood pressure. There was no evidence of
infection. Blood cultures were sent but had no growth at the
time of discharge and patient was afebrile without leukocytosis
throughout. Her metoprolol was held and was not restarted at the
time of discharge due to bradycardia.
.
# weakness: presumably secondary to hypotension.  FSBG was
normal. Neuro exam nonfocal throughout hospitalization. Her
weakness had resolved upon arrival to the ICU and she had no
further complaints.
.
# AFib: paroxysmal. On coumadin. INR currently 2.8. Following
metoprolol and diltiazem in EDs, HR dropped to 50s and as low as
the 30s.  All nodal agents were held and the following morning
she was in normal sinus rhythm. Her metoprolol was not restarted
at discharge due to bradycardia but her coumadin was continued
throughout.
.
# ESRD on HD qMWF. Last HD the day prior to admission. Likely
contributing to hypotension.  She was dialyzed the followi
