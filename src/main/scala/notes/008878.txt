Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain x 1 day


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 y/o w/ MMP including recent CABG and AVR [**2144-6-5**],
ex lap and [**Location (un) **] patch for duodenal perforation who p/w chest
pain x 1 day and new RBBB. Pt notes that she had 1 hour of sharp
SSCP that was sudden in onset, but gradually subsided on its own
over 1 hour time. She notes that it was similar to "gas pain"
that she has [**2-12**]/x month but did not go away with rubbing of her
belly as it usually does and was associated w/SOB and
palpitations which her gas pain usually is not. She notes that
at the time of her CABG, she did not have angina and is unable
to relate this as an anginal equivalent. She is bedridden at
this time and thus this was not exertional in nature. Also
unable to assess positional pain b/c she does not move much. She
was resting, not eating or exerting herself otherwise at the
time of onset. She denies associated N/V/diaphoresis/visual
changes. Also denies cough/fever/chills/HA/dizzyness. Is
depressed but denies recent new onset fatigue.
.
Per OSH records, she has had guiac + stool on and off since the
beginning of her stay at NESH.  She has been transfused for HCT
drops in the setting of guiac + stool on multiple occassions.
She takes iron supplements and her stool is often dark. She
denies
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pts vitals on presentation were T 98 HR 77 BP 126/54
RR 14 100% on her home vent settings. EKG showed a new RBBB, CK
was negative, but TNI was up from baseline. CT surgery was
notified of her admission. She received Aspirin 325mg, Morphine
4mg IV x 1 for lower back pain, not for chest pain.  While in
the ED, she was CP free.
.
Currently, she denies pain, notes that she did have an episode
of pain en route from the ED, sharp, lasting for minutes,
associated w/SOB. Resolved on its own once she arrived in the
unit. EKG was done and was unchanged from the ones prior, still
revealing new RBBB. Notes that had severe edema weeks ago but it
has greatly improved. Denies any LE cramping/pain. She has
chronic LBP.

CXR: Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is increased
opacity in the left, filling half of the hemithorax, likely
representing an accumulation of pleural fluid. A tracheostomy
tube, median sternotomy wires, and left subclavian catheter are
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Large left pleural effusion increased in size since
the most recent study dated [**2144-7-8**].
.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Limited study.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 75 y/o w/CABG and AVR [**2144-6-5**] who p/w sharp chest pain
associated w/dyspnea and palpitations x 1 day w/new RBBB, and
TNI elevation. EKGs: Review of EKGs from [**7-29**] - [**7-30**] reveal NSR
w/new RBBB morphology not present on [**7-9**] - [**7-12**]. Cardiology was
consulted and felt that the pt's EKGs were c/w prior IMI and
upon consultation of the cardiac surgery service, both services
felt that there was need for heparinization and that with TTE
w/o focal wall motion abnormalities, no indication for surgical
intervention. She was CP free throughout her course though she
did have epigastric tenderness around the site of her healing
wound from the perforated duodenal ulcer. General surgery was
consulted and evaluated the wound. The wound was repacked and
dressed.
She had guiac + stools, but stable HCTs, GI was consulted and
recommended outpt colonoscopy. She was J tube lavage negative
upon arrival.
She was weaned off of the vent and did well on 40%FiO2 via trach
mask.
