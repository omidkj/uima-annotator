[**2100-8-11**] Mitral Valve Repair(30mm [**Company 1543**] CG ring)


History of Present Illness:
81 year old male complaining of fatigue, intermittent chest
discomfort and shortness of breath. He has been followed by
cardiology for appoximately the last 5 years. Most recent echo

Findings: Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and
confirmed on an independent workstation.
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast in the body of the LA. Mild spontaneous echo contrast
in the LAA. All four pulmonary veins identified and enter the
left atrium.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness and cavity
size. Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal RV
systolic function.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets (3). Minimal AS. Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate thickening of mitral valve chordae. Moderate to severe
(3+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: Very small pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
   N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
POST CPB:
1. Annuloplasty ring in mitral position. Well seated and stable
with good leaflet excursion.Trae MR and a minimal gradient
across the mitral valve.
2. Unchanged left and right ventricular function (With
background inotropic support-Epinephrine). With A-V pacing
unable to assess presence of regional wall motion abnormalities.
3. Residual air present in the left atrium and asending aorta
after separation from CPB.
5. No other change

Radiology Report CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of
[**2100-8-14**] 4:44 PM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 81 year old man s/p MVrepair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:eval for ptx s/p line change over a
wire
Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after mitral valve
repair and change of line over the wire.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2100-8-15**]
obtained at 4:55 p.m.
Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC. The
replaced
mitral valve is unchanged in appearance. There is no change in
the
cardiomediastinal silhouette including cardiomegaly. Bibasilar
opacities are unchanged, most likely representing atelectasis,
but there is interval
improvement in pulmonary edema. Small pleural effusions are most
likely
present.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
