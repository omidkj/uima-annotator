HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old female
with type 2 diabetes, peripheral vascular disease status post
bilateral femoral distal bypass in [**2183**] and [**2184**] with a
history of atrial fibrillation who presents to the emergency
room complaining of abdominal pain. She states that she had
some dyspepsia for several weeks, but on the Friday prior to
admission, she developed severe abdominal pain. The pain she
described as non-radiating, constant, but feels better when
she rocks to and fro. The patient also states she had some
nausea and one episode of bilious emesis. The patient denies
fevers or chills or bright red blood per rectum or melena.
She denies discolored stools or dark urine.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Amiodarone, Coumadin, Lipitor, Mavik
and Avandia.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 96.5, heart rate 97,
blood pressure 128/77, respiratory rate 16, saturating 97% on
room air. General - elderly lady in no acute distress. HEENT
- anicteric. Cardiovascular - 2/4 systolic murmur noted,
irregular heart rate. Pulmonary exam - clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Abdomen was soft, nondistended, positive
tenderness in the right upper quadrant and epigastrium with
[**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign positive, positive periumbilical hernia with
reducible hernial sac. Extremities - bilateral lower
extremity edema with 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally. Rectal -
guaiac negative.

LABORATORY:  CBC - white blood cells 8, hematocrit 33.2,
platelets 172 with 85% neutrophils. Chem-7 - 132, 4.5, 106,
23, 25, 0.9 and glucose of 210. LFTs - 118, 209, 159, 1.4,
alkaline phosphatase 36. Ultrasound shows a thickened
gallbladder wall with the common bile duct 4 mm in diameter,
no stones seen.

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and
periumbilical hernia repair.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
on hospital day 1 for IV hydration and preop preparations.
She was started on IV fluids and Levo-Flagyl. The following
morning, she underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and a
repair of umbilical hernia. Her postoperative course was
complicated by difficult intravascular fluid management. Her
cardiac ejection fraction had previously been documented at
30% and the patient quickly became oliguric while at the same
time bilateral crackles were noted in the lung fields. Her
urine output was maintained with fluid boluses and her pulse
oximetry was noted to be satisfactory in the upper 90s on
nasal cannula oxygen. The patient's cardiovascular and urine
output status continued to deteriorate until postop day 6 at
which time she was transferred to the surgical intensive care
unit for better hemodynamic monitoring and fluid status
maintenance. At that time, her urine output had been 180 cc
for the previous 24 hours despite multiple fluid boluses and
IV fluid hydration. The patient's creatinine had increased to
1.7 from 0.7 preoperatively. At that time, due to fluid
overload, the patient developed respiratory distress and was
transferred to the SICU. Under more intensive monitoring, the
patient's hemodynamic status and urine output improved and
she was transferred back to the floor on postop day 9. At
that time, her creatinine had lowered back down to 0.6. The
patient continued to slowly improve until postop day 9 when
it was noted that her umbilical hernia repair wound was
draining some serous fluid. On investigation of this, it was
noted that her umbilical wound repair had failed so on postop
day 9, the patient was taken back to the operating room where
an open repair of a complex umbilical hernia repair was
performed. Postoperatively, the patient was maintained in the
PACU for better hemodynamic monitoring for the 1st postop
day. She was then transferred to the floor where she
continued to have low urine output and was difficult to
manage hemodynamically. She was able to be managed though
this time by increasing her beta blockade which kept her
heart in a sinus rhythm as opposed to reverting to atrial
fibrillation as it had multiple times throughout her hospital
stay. Throughout this hospital stay, she also complained of
multiple episodes of chest pain for which she was ruled out
for MI multiple times. Her EKG varied between atrial
fibrillation with moderate to fast ventricular response to
normal sinus rhythm. The tendency to enter atrial
fibrillation was secondary most probably to either
electrolyte imbalance which was corrected daily or to fluid
overload. On postoperative day 9, the patient was also noted
at the time of her periumbilical wound investigation and re-
repair to have some erythema surrounding the wound. For this,
she was placed on vancomycin which was continued for the 5
postop days after the 2nd surgery in the hospital and will be
continued with linezolid x7 more days in rehab. The patient
was discharged to rehab on postop day 5 and 16, stable.
