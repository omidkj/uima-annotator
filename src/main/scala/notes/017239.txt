.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and
time. The patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple,
unable to see JVP.
The carotid waveform was normal. There was no thyromegaly. The
were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
The patient had moderate pain with palpation over the site of
his chest pain.
The respirations were not labored and there were no use of
accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing. There is slightly increased edema on R as compared to
L, which is chronic according to the patient. There were no
abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits. Inspection and/or
palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed mild stasis
changes on the R leg.

IMAGING:
[**2179-5-18**] CXR: There is moderate enlargement of cardiac
silhouette. There is a small amount of left-sided pleural
effusion. Retrocardiac opacity is noted, most likely due to
atelectasis/consolidation. Right-sided CV line tip is projecting
within the right atrium. The patient is status post CABG.
IMPRESSION: 1. A small left-sided pleural effusion is unchanged.
2. Left retrocardiac opacity is noted. This suggests presence of
atelectasis/consolidation, underlying pneumonia cannot be
excluded. This process is unchanged compared to prior study.
[**2179-5-9**] CARDIAC CATH: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery
disease. The LMCA was patent. The LAD had 90% ISRS in the
previous stent with TIMI II flow. The D1 at the lesion has a 90%
origin lesion. The distal LAD had minimal disease. The LCX had
mid-segment 50% stenosis. The RCA had an anomalous origin from
the L coronary cusp. The proximal vessel had a 90% stenosis with
a crux 70% lesion. The PDA and PLB were large though short
vessels. 2. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided
filling pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was
10mmHg and RVEDP was 8mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressures were
elevated measuring 39/22mmHg. The left sided filling pressures
were mildly elevated (mean PCW pressure was 12mmHg). The
systemic arterial pressures were within normal range. The
cardiac index was within normal range. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. 3
vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Mildly elevated left and
right sided filling pressures. 3. Normal cardiac index.
[**2179-5-10**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with with mid to distal
anterior/septal/apical hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The aortic
arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2179-5-9**] for further
management of his myocardial infarction. Plavix and Integrilin
were started. He was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab
where he was found to have severe three vessel coronary artery
disease. Given the severity of his disease, the cardiac surgical
service was consulted for surgical management. Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. Given Mr. [**Known lastname 10881**]
increased irritability and inappropriateness, the psychiatry
service was consulted for assistance in his care. Seroquel and
Ativan were used with good effect. After several days of Plavix
washout, Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels.
Please see operative not for detail. Postoperatively he was
taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. He was
transfused with red blood cells for postoperative anemia.

On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact
and was extubated.  Vancomycin was started for a urine culture
positive for enterococcus. On post-operative day three, Mr.
[**Known lastname 1968**] was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assista
