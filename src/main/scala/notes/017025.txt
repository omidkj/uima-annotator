Chief Complaint:
Cough and increased trach secretions - Reason for initial MICU
admission patient with trach on ventilator

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
?????

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 75 year-old woman with history of COPD,
tracheobronchomalacia, bronchiectasis, MAC, diastolic CHF,
recent hospitalization from [**12/2167**] - [**3-/2168**] for HCAP/sepsis,
ultimately requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement.

Patient had recent long, complicated admission from [**12/2167**] -
[**3-/2168**] for HCAP (ESBL E.Coli and MRSA grew in sputum) and sepsis
complicated by respiratory failure requiring intubation and
later tracheostomy. Patient was treated with vanc and meropenem.
She had a BAL that grew aspergillus and was treated with a
course of voriconazole. At that time patient had been intubated
and later extubated at OSH prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. She had
persistent stridor at [**Hospital1 18**] and underwent bronchoscopy showing
severe distal tracheal malacia and severe bilateral main bronchi
malacia. A tracheostomy was performed on [**1-6**]. Throughout
hospitalization, she required intermittent PSV ventilation, but
was tolerating trach collar for prolonged periods of time.
Patient's course was complicated by multiple pneumothoraces
requiring several chest tube placements. She underwent
pleurodesis by thoracic surgeons on [**2168-3-15**] and the chest tube
was removed. She later had a recurrent pneumothorax requiring a
pig tail chest tube. The chest tube was again removed on
[**2168-3-24**] and patient did not have any further recurrent
pneumonthoraces. Patient was discharged on inhaled colistin to
supress any future infections.

Patient was discharged to the MACU at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**2168-3-25**].
She had been doing well and had been completely weaned off the
ventilator, but since [**2168-6-2**] she has had progressive
hypercapnia while off the ventilator. She also became
progressively tired and dyspnic off the ventilator. As per [**Hospital1 18**]
IP, patient may have recently had trach exchanged for shorter
trach; however, this is not documented in [**Hospital **] rehab records.
She also has had some cough and increased secretions. As per her
daughter she also ate salty soup one week ago and she had
worsenign pedal edema and dyspnea. She is admitted for
bronchoscopy and likely trach replacement by IP.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is comfortable and her breathing
is comfortable. She complains of some slightly worsened
peripheral edema, but otherwise no complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
ID: Patient is a 75 year-old woman with history of COPD,
tracheobronchomalacia, bronchiectasis, MAC, diastolic CHF,
recent hospitalization from [**12/2167**] - [**3-/2168**] for HCAP/sepsis,
ultimately requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement, presenting
with worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure and increased
ventilator requrirement.

# Respiratory failure: As per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU notes, patient
with worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was
previously weaned off vent, but now with increasing requirements
over last few days and requiring constant ventilation.
Differential diagnosis includes worsening tracheobronchial
malacia (possibly exacerbated by use of shorter trach),
infection - pneumonia vs. flare of bronchiectasis, diastolic
CHF, COPD flare. CXR showed no remarkable changes from prior.
Admitted to the MICU and given trial of trach mask which failed
so placed on CMV vent settings. Continued on baseline colistin
nebulizer treatments as well as inhalers. Plan for admission was
for interventional pulmonary to take pt to OR for trach exchange
and possible stent placement.  During bronchoscopy, there was no
trancheomalacia seen.  She had increased secretions which were
cleared and sent for culture.  Likely her respiratory failure
was due to a bronchiectasis flare with increased secretions.

# MAC/Bronchieactasis: Patient with known MAC. Concern for flare
given increased secretions. Decision made to wait for cultures
to help decide if additional antibiotics needed to be added to
baseline colistin.

# COPD: No wheezing on presentation. Continued on
Albuterol/Atrovent nebs

# Diastolic CHF: Patient appeared relatively euvolemic on
presentation and no edema on CXR. was continued on home dose of
lasix (20mg daily) during stay.

# Seizure disorder: Patient developed seizures thought secondary
to cephalosporins during last admission ([**2168-1-24**]). Now on
levetiracetam which was continued.
- Continue levetiracetam 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]

# Anxiety/Depression: Stabled. Continued on home quetiapine 25
mg qHS.

# Code: DNR, mechanical ventilation okay

# F/u Issues:
- Results of BAL from [**2168-6-10**] and possible need for antibiotics.
