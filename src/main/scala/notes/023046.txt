Admission Date:  [**2171-8-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2171-8-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**2099-6-25**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease
(status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2162**] with a left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery
graft, and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal graft, and
saphenous vein graft to diagonal graft).  She also has a past
medical history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease.

She presented to an outside hospital six hours after
developing [**10-8**] substernal chest pain that radiated to her
back, both arms, and neck.  The patient has had occasions of
similar intermittent chest pain over the last six week prior
to admission; however, the episodes had remitted in the past,
and on the day of admission these symptoms were recalcitrant
to Maalox, Pepto, Mylanta, and rest.

The patient's chest pain grew worse, and she reported to the
Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 3105**] where she
was found to have ST elevations in III and aVF with
reciprocal depressions in aVL, V2, and V3.  She had flipped T
waves in V1 and V2.  She was given Retavase times two with
decreased chest pain from [**9-7**] to [**9-7**] to [**5-8**] to [**6-7**].  The
patient was also given heparin, nitroglycerin drip, morphine,
and aspirin.

She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for percutaneous coronary intervention due to persistent pain
after lytic therapy.

She was taken to the catheterization laboratory where she was
found to have elevated right and left filling pressures.  She
had a 50% left main lesion, an left anterior descending
artery with mild luminal irregularities, left circumflex to
second obtuse marginal TO, right coronary artery with 40%
proximal, saphenous vein graft to second obtuse marginal with
a TO distally with thrombus, saphenous vein graft to second
diagonal diffusely diseased with 90% stenosis distally, left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery
with TO in the mid portion of the graft.  The right iliac had
a 90% calcified stenosis.  The occluded second obtuse
marginal was crossed with a wire and was treated with
rheolytic thrombectomy followed by hepakote stent placement
with zero residual stenosis with normal flow.  Chest pain was
completely resolved after her procedure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   (The patient's past medical history
included)
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
4.  Gout.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.
6.  Osteoarthritis.
7.  Reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  The patient's medications prior to
admission included aspirin, Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Prilosec, ibuprofen, Lasix, K-Dur, Trental, Roccal,
allopurinol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   The patient's
physical examination upon admission revealed a temperature
of 95.7, blood pressure was 126/56, respiratory rate was 12,
pulse was 64, and the patient was saturating 96% on 2 liters.
Generally, the patient was alert and oriented times three, in
no acute distress.  An elderly and obese female.  Her head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed she had
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.   The mucous membranes were moist.  The
patient's dentures were intact.  Her oropharynx was clear.
Neck examination revealed jugular venous pressure was 8 cm
lying flat.  The patient had no lymphadenopathy and no
thyromegaly.  On cardiovascular examination the patient had a
regular rate, normal first heart sound and second heart
sound.  A [**5-4**] diamond shaped systolic murmur.  Pulmonary
examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No
wheezes.  Abdominal examination was soft, nontender, obese,
with hyperactive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities revealed 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally, 1+
edema.  The patient had arterial sheath in place during her
admission physical.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's
laboratories on admission revealed a white blood cell count
of 7.2, hemoglobin was 11.8, hematocrit was 34.6, platelets
were 204.  Sodium of 140, potassium of 3.6, chloride of 105,
bicarbonate of 23, blood urea nitrogen of 11, creatinine
of 0.5, blood glucose of 97.  The patient's creatine kinases
were peaked at [**2136**], with a CK/MB of 249, and a CK/MB index
of 12.7.  The patient's lipid panel showed a triglyceride
level of 332, high-density lipoprotein of 46, low-density
lipoprotein of 171.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  (a)  Coronary artery disease:  The
patient was started on Plavix, aspirin, Lipitor, and an ACE
inhibitor during her hospitalization.  The patient was not
given Integrilin because she was already receiving lytic
therapy prior to her admission to [**Hospital1 190**].

The patient was taken back to the catheterization laboratory
on [**8-8**] where her saphenous vein graft to first diagonal
lesion was crossed, ballooned, and stented.  This procedure
was complicated by an episode of ventricular fibrillation
which was halted by one defibrillation.

The patient was discharged on 75 mg of Plavix per day for 26
days; to complete a course of 30 days, aspirin every day,
Lipitor 10 mg every day (which should be titrated upward to
decrease her low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to below
100).  If the patient's triglycerides do not significantly
decrease with Lipitor treatment, a second lipid-lowering
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] should be considered.

The second catheterization was necessary because of the
significant lesion that had not been stented in the first
procedure.  Unfortunately, both vessels could not be stented
in one procedure to the large amount of dye necessary to do a
longer procedure.

(b)  Pump:  The patient was given 25 mg b.i.d. of Lopressor
and 20 mg q.d. of lisinopril upon discharge.  She had two
echocardiograms done during her admission; the second of
which was done after her second procedure, and it showed a
left atrium that was mildly dilated and somewhat elongated.
The left ventricular wall thickness was normal.  The left
ventricular cavity size was normal.  Overall, left
ventricular systolic function was hard to assess but was
probably low-normal in the 50% to 55% range.  The patient's
right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were
normal.  The ascending aorta was mildly dilated.  The aortic
valve leaflets were mildly thickened, and there was mild 1+
aortic regurgitation seen.  The mitral valve leaflets were
mildly thickened, trivial mitral regurgitation was also seen.
 There was borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
 There was trivial physiologic pericardial effusion.

(c)  Rhythm:  The patient went into atrial fibrillation on
[**8-8**] with a rapid response.  The patient was asymptomatic;
however, she was loaded with p.o. amiodarone at 400 mg p.o.
t.i.d.   The patient re-entered atrial fibrillation on the
last night of her admission.  The patient was sent home on
additional anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin and Lovenox
for a target INR of 2.  The patient was not thought to need
lifetime anticoagulation and amiodarone if cardioversion is
successfully pursued roughly six months after anticoagulation
has been administered.  The amiodarone should be weaned down
to a target dose of 200 mg q.d.   The regimen should include
400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for two weeks; then 400 mg p.o. q.d. for
two weeks; then 200 mg p.o. q.d. from that time onward to
complete a 6-month course; at which cardioversion could be
considered.  The Coumadin should be dosed in a manner to
target INR to 2; keeping in mind that Coumadin and amiodarone
interact and a lower dose of Coumadin may be needed than
would otherwise be needed.

2.  PULMONARY:  The patient was with slight crackles at her
bases throughout her hospitalization.  They improved by the
time she was discharged but had not resolved.  It was thought
that she had baseline crackles that persisted since her
coronary artery bypass graft in the early [**2159**].  Her chest
x-ray was clear
