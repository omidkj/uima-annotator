HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby girl [**Known lastname 38329**] [**Known lastname 38330**]-[**Known lastname **],
triplet one, delivered at 24-5/7 weeks gestation, weighing
709 g, and was admitted to the Intensive Care Nursery for
management of extreme prematurity.
The mother is a 27-year-old gravida 2, para 1 (now 3) woman
with spontaneous triplet gestation.  Prenatal screens
included blood type O positive, antibody screen negative,
Rubella immune, rapid plasma reagin nonreactive, hepatitis B
surface antigen negative, and group B strep unknown.

The pregnancy was complicated by triplet gestation,
pregnancy-induced hypertension, triplet #2 and #3 monochorionic-
monoamniotic and intrauterine growth retardation in triplet #2.
Mother received a complete course of betamethasone prior to
delivery.  Delivery was by cesarean section under spinal
anesthesia for worsening pregnancy-induced hypertension.

This triplet was active at delivery and was given mask CPAP
and then was intubated in the delivery room secondary to
extreme prematurity.  Apgar scores were at 7 at one minute and 8
at 5 minutes respectively.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Weight of 709 g (25th
to 50% percentile), length of 32 cm (25th percentile), head
circumference 23 cm (25th percentile).  An active premature
infant, well perfused, with glistening skin.  No significant
bruising.  Anterior fontanel soft, open, flat.  Suture
approximated.  Eyes fused.  No clef.  Lungs with crackles and
retracting.  Normal first heart sound and second heart sound.
No murmur.  Abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly or masses.
Genitalia consistent with extreme prematurity.  Spine was
intact.  Hips were stable.  Neurologic examination was
nonfocal and age appropriate.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

 1.  RESPIRATORY:  Received two doses of Survanta for
respiratory distress syndrome, initially requiring conventional
ventilatory support, then transitioning to high frequency
oscillatory ventilation between day 3 and 12 of life.
Subseuqently remained on conventional ventilation through day 51
of life, then CPAP through day 58, followed by nasal cannula
oxyegn through day 110 ([**2136-4-17**]). Chronic lung disease was
treated with Diuril 40 mg/kg per day divided b.i.d. She also
received caffeine citrate for apnea of prematurity. This was
discontinued on [**2136-2-16**], with the last spontaneous
apnea/bradycardia occuring on [**2136-3-12**]. A baseline chest
radiograph prior to discharge shows resolving diffuse chronic
lung changes but no focal parenchymal infiltrates..

 2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  [**Known lastname 38329**] treated for low mean blood
pressures following birth with a normal saline bolus, then
dopamine infusion with maximum support 2.5 mcg/kg per minute
in the first 24 hours.  She also received a course of Indocin for
a presumed patent ductus arteriosus within the first 48 hours
of life.  She has remained hemodynamically stable since. At
discharge, the cardiovascular examination is negative.

 3.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION: Enteral feeds were started on
day of life 6 and reached full on day of life 14 without
problems.  The caloric density was increased gradually to a
maximum of 32 calories per ounce with ProMod.  The calories
were weaned gradually starting on day of life 68 with good
growth.  Has been on 20-calorie per ounce breast milk since
[**2136-4-1**].  At the time of discharge she is feeding ad lib
demand or breast feeding well with good weight gain.

KCL supplements have been given due to diuretic-associated
electrolyte losses. Electrolytes on [**2136-4-19**] were
sodium of 139, potassium of 4.6, chloride of 99, bicarbonate
of 31.  On [**2136-4-9**], the calcium was 10, the phosphorous
was 6, alkaline phosphatase was 452, albumin was 4.

Discharge weight is 3970 grams, length is 51 cm and head
circumference is 36 cm.

 4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  [**Known lastname 38329**] was treated with phototherapy for
indirect hyperbilirubinemia.  Maximum bilirubin peak of 3.4
and direct bilirubin of 0.2.

 5.  HEMATOLOGY:  Her blood type is B positive. She received
total transfusion of 5 units of packed red blood cells during
hospitalization, with the last transfusion on [**2136-2-3**].
The most recent hematocrit was on [**2136-4-19**] and was 33.8% with
a reticulocyte count of 2.8.

 6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Received 48 hours of ampicillin and
gentamicin following birth for rule out sepsis with a normal
complete blood count and negative blood cultures.

On day of life 22, she also started a 10-day course of gentamicin
and cefotaxime for tracheitis pneumonia with culture positive,
tracheal aspirate for Klebsiella pneumoniae.  The blood
cultures was negative.  Complete blood count was within
normal limits, and spinal fluid was negative.

 7.  NEUROLOGY:  Has had multiple head ultrasounds since
birth with the last at 36 weeks gestation; all were within
normal limits.  No bleeding or periventricular leukomalacia.

 8.  SENSORY:  Hearing screening was performed with automated
auditory brain stem response, passed both ears.

 9.  OPHTHALMOLOGY:  Eyes were examined; most recently on
[**2136-3-21**], revealing mature retinal vessels.  A
follow-up examination is recommended in eight months.

10.  PSYCHOSOCIAL:  The parents have been very involved with
the babies.  Triplet #2 died within a few days of birth.  The
social worker has been involved with the family.  The contact
social worker's name is [**Name (NI) 4457**] [**Name (NI) 38331**]; and she can be
