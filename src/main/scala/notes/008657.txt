Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Terazosin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 84 yo M with PMHx sig. for diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma, COPD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for 2
days of worsening dyspnea. Pt denies chest pain, fevers. He was
a little nauseous, no vomiting.
.
Pt was recently admited from [**Date range (1) 107339**] for dyspnea. He was
found to have parainfluenza type 3 and NSTEMI v. demand
ischemia. His tropT peaked at 0.27. ECHO had shown newly
depressed LVEF of 30-35% with akinesis of the apex and distal
LV. This was felt to be c/w Takosubo's cardiomyopathy. Repeat
ECHO showed probably (suboptimal quality) normal LV systolic
function wtih EF of 50-55%. He was also ruled out for PE with
chest CTA.
.
At OSH, initial VS were: T 100.3, BP 167/77, HR 98, RR 22, 93%
on RA. Exam was sig. for diminished breath sounds bilaterally.
CXR was red as no infiltrates, no CHF. WBC was 15.6, 84%
neutrophils, 6% lymphocytes. Pt was given tylenol.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were: afeb, 102, 170/100, 30,
97 on 3L. Exam with sig. for bibasilar rales, expir wheezes, and
1+ pitting pedal edema. Labs were sig. for WBC of 15.1, CK 92,
TropT 0.06, BNP 4000. EKG showed STD in V4-6. CXR showed ?RLL
infiltrate. Pt was given CTX, levofloxacin, combivent
nebulizers, lasix 40 mg IV, and ASA 325 mg. Currently, VS are
111/59, 104, 38, 94% on RA. UOP of 500cc of urine.
.
On the floor, he states his sx got worse since hosptial
discharge. Has been having orthopnea, DOE, and increased ankle
edema. Has been sleeping in recliner or on sofa. Has been
needing his atrovent nebulizer every 6 hours and his albuterol
inhaler every 3-4 hours. Reports feeling SOB and wheezy at home.
Denies cough and sputum. Did not take home lasix or metoprolol
today.

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (Per recent note by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**]:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 107336**] initially presented on [**2198-12-30**], with a
newly identified 8 cm right atrial soft tissue mass. He
underwent biopsy of this on [**2200-1-3**], and pathology showed
high-grade aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, staining
positive for CD20, bcl-2, and bcl-6 in a small subset. Cells
were negative for cytokeratins, CD138, bcl-1, and |bcl-6. MIB
fraction was 95-100%. Bcl-2 co-expression and lack of CD10
argued against Burkitt's lymphoma; however, FISH studies were
positive for c-myc rearrangement. He was diagnosed with
high-grade cardiac lymphoma on the spectrum of diffuse large
B-cell to Burkitt's lymphoma. No other sites of disease were
identified by torso CT and bone marrow biopsy. He has begun
R-[**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy on [**2200-1-7**]. Treatment course has been
complicated by a DVT status post IVC filter in [**1-/2200**] and
pneumonia requiring intubation for hypoxia in [**2-27**].

Retired after career in the airlines. 60 pack year smoking
history but no tobacco for the past six years. He was living
independently prior to his previous admission after which he was
discharged to rehab.

Reports-
CXR [**2200-4-27**]:
FINDINGS: There is stable bibasilar atelectasis, left greater
than right. Otherwise, the lungs are clear with no signs of
pneumonia or congestive heart failure. No pleural effusions or
pneumothorax. The left costophrenic angle is not imaged. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in appearance and
demonstrate tortuosity of the aorta. Visualized osseous
structures are unremarkable. Note is made of an IVC filter.
IMPRESSION: Mild bibasilar atelectasis. No evidence of pneumonia
or
congestive heart failure.
.
ECHO [**4-23**]:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is probably normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**11-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-4-21**], the
LVEF has probably improved (suboptimal image quality and distal
LV/apex porrly seen on current study). If clinically indicated,
a repeat study with echo contrast (dDefinity) may help evaluate
regional and global LV systolic function.
.
CTA chest [**4-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. New small consolidation at right lung base may represent
pneumonic
consolidation or, in the setting of airway secretions,
aspiration.
3. Perhaps slight decrease in size of cardiac mass compared to
CT from [**2200-3-26**], with persistent mass effect on superior
vena cava.
4. No change in size of right adrenal mass and right lower lobe
lung nodule.
.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 105 bpm. LAD. STD in V4-V6 and TWI in
V3-V6, new since [**2200-4-21**].
.
ECHO [**2200-4-30**]
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-4-23**],
image quality has improved. As a result, wall motion can be seen
to be normal with near-hyperdynamic overall function. The other
findings are similar.
