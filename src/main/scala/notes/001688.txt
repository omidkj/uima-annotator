on [**2117-3-19**].

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAM:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 67-year-old
man who speaks mostly Portugese with a history of multiple
prior interventions to the left circumflex artery and history
of coronary artery bypass graft in [**2109**], as well as
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and RCA in
[**2114**] with a history of progressive rest angina, orthopnea and
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea in the setting of a positive
MIBI.  In [**2097**], he noted the initial onset of his angina he
was evaluated with coronary catheterization in [**2098-12-10**] as well as [**2106-12-11**], [**2109-7-11**], [**2114-7-11**]
and finally [**2117-3-4**] he had a MIBI during which he
was able to exercise for six minutes to a peak heart rate of
128 and blood pressure of 184/80.  At this time, he
experienced chest tightness, but an electrocardiogram was
uninterpretable because of digoxin baseline abnormalities.
MIBI revealed an ejection fraction of 37% in the inferior
wall defecting reversibility.  He was begun on Imdur one week
prior to admission and he had a slight decrease in frequency
of his symptoms as a result.  Currently, he has been having
very poor exercise tolerance with shortness of breath, chest
tightness with walking in the house.

The patient denies edema and lightheadedness, but reports
two-pillow orthopnea and occasional paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.  He has a long history of bilateral claudication and
he gets symptoms after walking five minutes at a slow pace.
Coronary artery disease risks are cholesterol, diabetes and
family history.  He has not had a history of hypertension,
nor a history of smoking.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Elevated lipids.
2.  Myocardial infarction.
3.  Bilateral claudication.
4.  In [**February 2098**] a percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty to the LAD and LCX, in 12/90 percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty to the LCX and OM, in 2/93
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to LCX and OM,
[**7-/2114**] percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to the
RCA.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  [**7-/2109**] coronary artery bypass graft with vein graft to the
obtuse marginal 2.
2.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in [**2110**].
3.  Femoral popliteal bypass.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies, no shellfish and
no dye allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Humulin 45 NPH units subcutaneous q a.m. and 4 units
subcutaneous q p.m.
2.  Regular insulin 4 units [**Hospital1 **].
3.  Lasix 120 mg [**Hospital1 **].
4.  Zestril 20 mg qid.
5.  Trental 400 mg tid.
6.  Procardia XL 30 mg qd.
7.  Pravachol 20 mg qd.
8.  Aspirin 325 mg po qd.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for cerebrovascular accident,
transient ischemic attack and melena.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married and lives with his wife who
works for the school system in the dietary department.

LABS:  His white blood cell count was 10.7.  His hematocrit
was 37.2.  His PTT was 12.6.  His platelet count was 190.
Sodium 142, potassium 4.6, chloride 103, bicarbonate 26, BUN
24, creatinine 1.4.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
GENERAL:  He is a moderately obese male with no apparent
distress, however he was obviously anxious.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Within normal limits.
LUNGS:  Clear.  He had a healed sternal scar.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Soft with an aortobifemoral scar.  He had right
saphenectomy vein harvest scar and a right femoral popliteal
scar.
EXTREMITIES:  Left lower extremity had no major varicosities.
SKIN:  Okay.  There was no edema.
His pulses were 2+ carotids bilaterally without bruits.
Radials were 2+ bilaterally and there was no palpable DP
pulse on either the right or the left.
NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.

IMAGING:  His electrocardiogram demonstrated a regular rate
with a bundle branch block.  There were global T-wave
changes.

The patient was admitted therefore to undergo a coronary
artery bypass grafting.  This was a redo procedure.  He had a
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending and
saphenous vein graft to the distal LAD performed.  This was
done by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and the patient was transported in
the atrial paced mode from the Operating Room to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on Neo-Synephrine drip
with a mean arterial pressure of 58, CVP of 13, PAD of 15,
[**Doctor First Name 1052**] of 20.

The patient was weaned to extubation on postoperative day #1.
The site was advanced.  On postoperative day #2 he was pan
cultured for a fever of 101.5??????.  He was improved later on
that day.  His chest tubes were removed.  He was diuresed.
Follow up of his cultures revealed no growth in the blood or
urine cultures.  There was only oropharyngeal flora in the
sputum.  His chest x-ray demonstrated small bilateral pleural
effusions.  Swan was in place.  There was no pneumothorax
seen on either side.   [**Female First Name (un) 3408**] saw the patient and
recommended changes in his insulin.

On postoperative day #3, the patient was found to be very
upset.  This was reported by the patient later on and his
daughter to be reaction to Percocet and has been seen in the
past.  The patient was therefore taken off of all pure
narcotic agents and placed on strictly Tylenol for pain
control.  He was supplemented with Nubain, a narcotic
agonist-antagonist medication.  His exercise capacity was
good and he was seen ambulating in the [**Doctor Last Name **] multiple times
during the day.  The patient was seen by physical therapy and
found to have a slight increase in his systolic blood
pressure over his resting systolic blood pressure while he
was exercising.  He has a sliding scale provided by the
[**Hospital 3408**] [**Hospital 982**] Clinic.  On postoperative day #5, he had
been ambulating sufficiently in the [**Doctor Last Name **] and was seen by
physical therapy.  They noted an increase in his systolic
blood pressure during ambulation over his resting systolic
blood pressure and plans were made to increase his Lopressor
dose to 50 mg po bid from 25 mg po bid.  Plans were therefore
made to discharge the patient.

DISPOSITION:  Discharge to home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 120 mg po bid.

3.  Procardia XL 30 mg po qd.
4.  Pravachol 20 mg po qd.
5.  ASA 81 mg po qd.
6.  Lopressor 50 mg po bid.
7.  Tylenol 1 gm po q8h prn pain.
8.  NPH insulin 40 units subcutaneous q a.m., 50 units
subcutaneous q hs.
9.  Sliding scale of regular insulin.  0 to 100 give nothing,
100 to 150 2 units, 151 to 200 3 units, 201 to 250 4 units,
251 to 300 5 units, 301 to 350 6 units, 351 to 400 7 units
and greater than 400 10 units and call the primary M.D.

FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to follow up with
wound check at the Far Six Nursing Area in approximately one
week.  He should follow up with his primary care physician in
one to two weeks and he should make arrangements to follow up
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for a postoperative wound check with
the attending surgeon in approximately four weeks.
