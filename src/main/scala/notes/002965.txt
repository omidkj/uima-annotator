History of Present Illness:
 82yo F with h/o renal artery stenosis, CKD stage III, pAF on
coumadin presents with BRBPR X 3 yesterday. Patient presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] about 1 month ago with increased creatinine to 3 (from
1.6). A workup including renal biopsy revealed pauci-immune
P-ANCA positive glomerulonephritis thought secondary to
hydralazine. She was started on prednisone and cyclophosphamide
at that point.
In addition, according to the patient and records from [**Hospital **] she was also recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] after a
collapse one month ago. She was brought in and found to have AF
with RVR. Was started on dilt and metoprolol with reportedly
good control. Further workup there included an EGD and
colonoscopy which revealed gastric ulcers and polyps as well as
candidiasis. She received 2units pRBCs and her hct came up to
30. While there she was noted to be neutropenic. They thought
this was possibly medication related. Cyclophosphamide, bactrim,
and fluconazole were discontinued. She completed a course of
caspofungin and a TTE was negative for vegetations. Her WBC
count came up. She was discharged to [**Hospital3 **].
Today was feeling weak and tired and then had 3 episodes of
BRBPR so decided to come to Ed. Presented to ED in AF with RVR
to 160s. Received 10mg Iv Dilt with improvement in rate to high
90s/100. Received then 30mg PO dilt. Stable HRs since. Also
received 5mg IV metoprolol.
Initial VS: 97.8 137AF 111/78 16 99. No N/V/Abd pain. Just feels
tired. Rectal exam revealed guaiac positive dark stool. Received
IVF and 40mg IV protonix. Hct in ED is 27 consistent with
baseline (25-30) here at [**Hospital1 18**]. Were going to do NGL but decided
not to because didn't want her to go back into AF with RVR. GI
called in Ed and will see her on the floor.
.
On the floor, patient complained of being sick of being in the
hospital and dry mouth. Otherwise densies fevers, chills,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.
Has had some weight loss worked up in the past and possibly
related to depression (per the patient) after her friend died
recently. Complained of occasional flank pain at biopsy site and
a developing bed sore. Rest of ROS negative including no CP,
palps, sob, dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
82yo F with h/o PUD and CKD with recent acute renal failure from
hydralazine induced pauci-immune glomerulonephritis admitted
with BRBPR and atrial fibrillation with RVR.
.
# GIB: Given significant orthostasis, hct down to 24 (baseline
30) and history of PUD, initially concerned about UGIB.  NG
lavage was negative which was reassuring.  She was given 2u pRBC
with stable blood counts and hemodynamics.  She had an EGD on
[**4-13**] without e/o active bleeding.  Per GI likely LGIB and will
need c-scope sometime during this admission.  She was also given
2u FFP given coagulopathy and concern for GIB and need for
endoscopy. Bleeding ceased, however, colonoscopy deferred
secondary to difficult to control AFib with RVR. She should
follow-up as an outpatient for colonscopy.
.
# AF with RVR: She had been on sotolol for several years until
her recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] when this was discontinued in the
setting of her worsening renal failure.  She was noted to have
AF with RVR to 140s.  Initially felt to be worsened by volume
depletion with GIB.  However, despite blood products, she
remained tachycardic and thus nodal agents were resumed.
Anticoagulation was held in acute setting, with coagulopathy
reversed in the setting of GIB. She was uptitrated on her PO
regimen to Metoprolol 50mg TID and Diltiazem 30mg QID which kept
her HR in reasonable control until she underwent a bowel prep
for her colonoscopy. On the morning of the scheduled
colonoscopy, she developed AFib with RVR in the setting of
dehydration evidence by alkalosis and hypernatremia. She
received agressive IV hydration and multiple IV medications to
help control rate. Her heart rate initially responded and
stabilized in the 90-100's. However, the following evening, she
required another bowel prep and her heart rate escalated to the
150's. She received additional IV nodal agents and her PO
regimen was increased. An electrophysiology consult was obtained
and the recommendation was for rate control and uptitration with
her current medications. Rhythm control was deferred. She was
restarted on anti-coagulation on HD#5 with a heparin gtt. A TEE
showed no evidence of thrombus. A cardioversion was attempted
and was unsuccessful. The patient was loaded with amiodarone and
the Metoprolol was uptitrated to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] to achieve adequate
rate control. She was started on Diltiazem which was uptitrated
to 45mg PO QID.  HR was in the 80s on discharge.  Her coumadin
was re-started and heparin gtt was continued until the INR was
therapeutic.  Her INR became supratherapeutic and Coumadin was
held on discharge.  She should
