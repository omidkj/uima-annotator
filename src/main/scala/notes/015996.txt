History of Present Illness:
86 yo w/ pmh of h/o breast ca, htn, w/ increasing confusion over
few days noted by neighbors. Also c/o abdominal pain. Brought by
EMS to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Initially alert but non-verbal and unable to
answer questions in ED. Initial vitals in the ED: 93.8, 76,
110/68, 16, 98RA, lactate of 4.7. Code sepsis called and early
goal directed therapy was intiated. A RIJ placed with CVP of 8
(per ED resident). Given 2L IVF. Due to elevated lactate and
question of mesenteric ischemia with exam finding of a diffusely
tender abdomen she was evaluated by surgery. They felt pt. did
not have an acute abdomen and that there was no indication for
abd CT. Repeat lactate improved to 2.4 then 2.0. Per [**Name (NI) **], pts.
mental status improved with fluids. UA shows >50 WBC, mod leuks,
many bacteria. Pt. started on cipro/flagyl. Notable labs: WBC of

CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST
[**2122-12-8**]
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.
FINDINGS: Examination of the brain is somewhat limited by
massively thickened calvarium. The visualized portions of the
brain appear unremarkable. No acute hemorrhage is identified.
The density values of the brain parenchyma appear maintained.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or
hydrocephalus.
The entire cranial vault, skull base, and visualized facial
bones are markedly thickened and irregular with areas of small
lucency. Normal trabeculae are not identified. No destructive
bony lesions are seen.
The visualized portions of C1 and C2 vertebral bodies are
unremarkable. The mastoid air cells are aerated. The right
maxillary sinus is clear. The left maxillary sinus is partially
opacified. Similarly, there is partial opacification of the
ethmoid air cells. There is complete opacification and
obliteration of the sphenoid sinus.
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Massive thickening of the skull. This likely represent
Paget's disease.

ECHO [**2122-12-10**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal images (no short axis images).
Hyperdynamic LV function with mild resting LVOT gradient and
mild aortic stenosis. Probable diastolic dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. E. coli UTI/urosepsis -- Initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
treated with ciprofloxacin and flagyl.  She responded well and
was transferred to the medical floor for further care.  IV
ciprofloxacin was continued secondary to poor po intake related
to mental status changes.  She will continue a 10 day course of
cipro IV with the last dose to be given on [**2122-12-19**].  A repeat
urine cx was obtained on the above antibiotic regimen which was
negative.  She had a foley placed during her initial ICU stay
that was subsequently removed. She has remained afebrile without
leukocytosis for the last 5 days of admission.

2. Altered mental status -- Independed of all ADLs prior to
arrival.  Very hard of hearing, thought to contribute to her
difficulty communicating.  She slowly improved during the course
of the admission.  On the day prior to discharge a family
meeting was held and the patient's son felt that she was about
back to her baseline.  He remarked that communication with her
is difficult and sometimes she needs to have things written down
due to her poor hearing.  It is unclear if the patient is
stubborn and doesn't want to respond to the staff because when
her son appeared she was responsive to his questions.

4. Paget's disease--patient was treated with tylenol for pain

5. HTN--patient's bp meds were initially held on admission and
lopressor was added back at 25mg po bid for adequate control.
The patient has been intermittently refusing meds and or
cheeking them so it is important that the nurses monitor her
swallowing the pills.

6.  Breast ca--patient was continued on her tamoxifen.
