Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, neutropenia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT-guided biopsy of liver abscess.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 63yo female with relapsed AML being treated with
palliative chemomotherapy and supported with blood product
transfusions.  She has been treated with most recently Dacogen
(Decitabine, [**2113-12-20**] x5, 1/31/07x5, [**1-/2214**]x5, 3/28/07x5,
4/25/07x5, and last dose [**Date range (1) 65010**]).   She presented today to
clinic for counts/transfusion, and was noted to have a fever to
100.7, so was referred for admission.   Of note, she had
complained of left tooth pain 1 week ago, which was evaluated by
her outpatient Dentist.  She was recommended to have a root
canal, but due to her low counts, this could not be done.  She
was started on Penicillin VK [**2114-5-15**].  Her tooth pain is no
longer present.  She also c/o R shoulder/neck pain which
resolved with tylenol and she attributed to a muscle strain.
Finally, she complains of R pleuritic chest pain, present with
deep breaths, walking, or lying on the side.  She is
neutropenic, with ANC of 55 and 71% Blasts.
.
ROS: Positive for productive cough x 2 days, right pleuritic
chest pain, and urgency (cannot make it to bathroom in time,
which she attributes to increased fatigue.  Has night sweats but
they have been present x 2 years.  Denies fever at home (highest
measured temp 99).  Also denies cardiac chest pain, abdominal
pain, dysuria, nausea/vomiting, or diarrhea.
.
In clinic labs revealed ANC of 55 with 71% blasts on diff.  she
had blood/urine cultures drawn, was given Ertapenem and tylenol,
as well as 1 unit of Platelets.

Past Medical History:
- Adult onset ADHD
- Hypercholesterolemia
- Obesity
- AML (as per onc history below)
- Lumbar spine disk herniation (L2-L4, no surgical intervention)

.
Pertinent Oncologic History: (from OMR notes)
The patient is a 63-year-old female with relapsed AML. She is
s/p cycles  6 of decitabine chemotherapy. She is status post
seven  and three induction back in [**2112-11-10**] followed by
three  rounds of high-dose ARA-C. She relapsed in [**Month (only) 216**] of
[**2112**], then  received MEC chemotherapy but failed to obtain
remission.
.
The patient initially presented in [**2112-10-11**] with fatigue,
generalized malaise, petechiae and subsequent CBC/diff revealed

blasts. Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for induction. Bone marrow was c/w AML
(suggestive of FAB M1) with normal cytogenetics. Her regimen
involved 7+3 [**Doctor First Name **]/araC, which was started [**2112-11-10**]. Her induction

course was complicated by mucositis. Her consolidation treatment
involved high dose araC times 3 cycles, with her last treatment

in [**2113-3-11**]. Her consolidation treatment was complicated by 2

admissions for febrile neutropenia. No positive cultures grew
over that time. She achieved a remission (marrow biopsy on
[**2112-12-20**]), but was readmitted in [**7-16**] for relapse. During that
admission, the patient presented with thrombocytopenia and
circulating blasts consistent with relapse AML. The patient
received MEC induction. The day 14 bone marrow revealed a
hypocellular biopsy but with residual blast froms. The bone
marrow biopsy was repeated 4 days later revealed 27% blasts in
the aspirate and CD34+ blasts in the core (which was only 10%
cellular in total).

Social History:
Widowed, splits time between [**Location (un) 8242**] (where she lives
alone)and with daughter in [**Name (NI) 189**]. Has two children, three
grandchildren. Non-smoker, occasional social EtOH, no drug use.




Family History:
No known history of blood malignancies; father: colon ca;
mother: brain masses. one brother (non-HLA match) one
half-brother.

KEY STUDIES:
CT Chest [**2114-5-22**]: This study is not designed to examine the
abdomen; however, a focal rounded 5.0 x 3.7 cm low-density
lesion in segment VIII of the liver, bulging the capsule, is new
since the CT scan of [**2114-2-20**]. The right adrenal lesion is
unchanged, measuring 1.7 x 1.1 cm. The spleen is enlarged, but
similar to the previous study.
Impression
1.  New 5-cm rounded low attenuation segment VIII liver lesion,
bulging the capsule and with intermediate attenuation ([**Doctor Last Name **]
30-45). Relatively rapid
interval development may reflect an infectious process such as a
liver
abscess. Hematoma is less likely, but might be included in
differential
diagnosis in this patient with AML. Rapid evolution not typical
for
granulocytic sarcoma (chloroma). Ultrasound is recommended for
further
evaluation.
2.  Similar appearance of right adrenal lesion, which can be
further
characterized with dedicated MRI.
3.  Unchanged appearance of small pericardial effusion.
4.  Chest radiograph appearance accounted for by atelectasis at
both lung
bases.  No consolidations.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2114-5-28**] compared to [**2114-5-22**]: There has been
interval decrease in size of hypodensity in segment VIII of the
liver, which currently measures roughly 19 x 16 mm, decreased
from previous exam when it measured 40 x 36 mm.  No other focal
liver lesions are identified.  There is no biliary ductal
dilatation. There is trace ascites around the liver.  Small 15
mm right adrenal nodule, unchanged from [**2114-5-23**] study.
Impression: 1.  Interval decrease in size of liver abscess in
segment VIII. 2.  Small right pleural effusion and adjacent
relaxation atelectasis. 3.  Unchanged indeterminate right
adrenal nodule.

[**2114-5-24**] ECHO:Conclusions: LVEF>55%. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is at least moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.Compared
with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-12-20**], estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher and tricuspid
regurgitation is now much more prominent. The right ventricle
chamber size is now larger.
