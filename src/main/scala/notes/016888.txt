Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 76 yo female with h/o diastolic CHF, a fib recently
started on levaquin 2 days ago for cough and fever. Pt is a
nursing home resident and was found to be hypotensive with SBPs
in 70s. The pt was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 17331**] with acute on
chronic diastolic CHF. During her hosptialization she was
diuresed with lasix 10 - 20 mg IV throughout the admission and
quickly returned to her baseline oxygen needs, satting in the
mid to upper 90's on 2LNC.  She was discharged on lasix 20 mg PO
lasix daily. There was no evidence of
infection/pneumonia or COPD flare, and she was not continued on
levofloxacin or solumedrol after the initial doses in the ED.
The pt was in her USOH until she was started on levaquin as an
outpatient two days ago when she developed an increasing cough
productive of sputum and fever. O2 requirements have not changed
from her baseline 2L NC. She was transferred to the ED after
being found incidentally to have a systolic BP in the 70s at her
nursing home. Her fluid restriction had been reduced from 1L
daily to 2L in the setting of her illness.
.
In the ED, T Bp HR, RR, O2 sats. She was given 500 cc of NS
because they were concerned about volume overload. The pt was
found to have ARF with a Cr of 2.6 (up from baseline of 1.1),
hyponatremia, and hypotension. The pt spiked temp to 103 however
further IVF was held for concern of underlying CHF. She was
started on vancomycin and continued on levaquin. On arrival to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was resting quite comfortably with stable
vital signs and sating 97% on a 2L NC.

CXR [**7-10**]:
INDICATION: SOB and hypertension.
COMPARISON: [**2189-6-25**].
AP UPRIGHT CHEST: Increased pulmonary interstitial streaky
opacity
is consistent with increased pulmonary edema. Moderate
cardiomegaly is
stable. There are stable tracheobronchial tree calcifications
and aortic arch calcifications. Extensive degenerative disease
in the thoracolumbar spine with severe S-shaped rotatory
thoracic scoliosis is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Moderate CHF.

PROCEDURE: CT chest without contrast on [**2189-7-13**].

COMPARISON: [**2188-3-5**] and [**2189-6-1**].

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the
thoracic inlet to
the subdiaphragmatic area without contrast. Thinner slice 5 mm
and 1.25 mm
images were reconstructed at different window algorithms.
Sagittal/coronal
reformatted images were also obtained for further evaluation.

HISTORY: 76-year-old woman with septic physiology but no clear
source.
Suspect pulmonary process,congestive heart failure. Evaluate for
pulmonary
infectious process.

FINDINGS:

The study is partly degraded at the lung bases limiting the
accurate
evaluation of any subtle changes as there exist course but
smooth pulmonary
reticulation with no bronchiectasis, honeycombing or significant
emphysema.

In the upper lobes which are not affected by motion artifact,
similar areas of
reticulation are seen mainly along the periphery unchanged since
the chest CTA
of [**2188-3-5**].

The heart especially the left atrium is enlarged. The aorta is
normal in
caliber. Coronary vascular calcification is stable. Pulmonary
arteries are
enlarged; the trunk measures 33 mm while the right pulmonary
artery measures
31 mm.

There is a stable small pericardial effusion. There is slight
increase of
bilateral small bibasilar pleural effusions.

There are pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum
as well as
the hilar regions, essentially unchanged from the prior
examination including
a 19 mm subcarinal lymph node, 9.2 mm left prevascular lymph
node and a 9 mm
right upper paratracheal lymph node. The bones do not show any
lesions
suspicious for malignancy or infection. Note is made of severe
degenerative
changes, scoliosis of multiple osseous fractures.

Limited evaluation of the abdomen shows no abnormality.

IMPRESSION:

1) Smooth interstitial thickening at the periphery of the lungs
stable since
[**2188-2-21**] indicating chronicity, however, its slow
progression argues
against UIP.
2) No change in the cardiomegaly, aortic calcification.

3) Stable pulmonary hypertension.

4) Multiple enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.

5) Slight worsening of bilateral pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was intially admitted to the ICU and received
aggressive IVF resuscitation (>9 liters) and empiric
piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin. Despite culture negative
tests, she responded to this therapy with normalization of her
labs and improvement in her vital signs. She was transferred to
the floor, where she completed a 7 day course of empiric
antibiotics without incident. It was also noted that she had
acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure which may
have been triggered by flash pulmonary edema from rapid
ventricular response from her atrial fibrillation. She was then
aggressively rate controlled with a combination of metoprolol
succinate, extended release diltiazem, and low dose digoxin. On
discharge, her resting heart rate varied between 50-80 and with
activity, peaked at 100.
