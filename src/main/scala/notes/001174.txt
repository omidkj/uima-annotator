Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 281**]
Chief Complaint:
Malignant central airway obstruction.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2122-4-20**]: Flexible bronchoscopy Therapeutic debridement of
necrotic material.Therapeutic aspiration of secretions.
[**2122-4-17**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with tumor debridement
[**2122-4-17**]: Bronchoscopy
[**2122-4-15**]: Flexible bronchoscopy. PDT activation.
[**2122-4-13**]: Flexible bronchoscopy. Endobronchial biopsy, left

History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 55-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer
who has failed multiple treatment therapy regimens.  She was
recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] from [**2122-2-4**] to [**2122-2-7**] for
chief complaint of central airway obstruction and acute dyspnea.
 She underwent rigid bronchoscopy and tumor debridement of the
left upper lobe and balloon dilatation of the left upper lobe
and left lower lobe.

She was discharged to home after a few days and since her rigid
bronchoscopy she reports significant improvement in her dyspnea.
 She does have persistent cough.  The only thigh that makes her
cough better is Tessalon 200 mg t.i.d. to q.i.d.  She denies any
significant sputum or hemoptysis.  She has had no fevers,
chills, or night sweats.  She was recently diagnosed with
metastatic
involvement of the left eye and she is planning for radiation
therapy soon.  She self weaned her prednisone to 15 mg daily.

She Underwent flex bronch [**2122-4-13**] which showed Necrotic debris
right main stem, left upper lobe which likely represents tumor
involvement verus infection. Accordingly, she was injected with
photofrin in the same day.

Patient is admitted for PDT activation.

CXR:
[**2122-4-21**]: the last study, the patient was extubated and the
Dobbhoff tube was removed. Multifocal opacity overall slightly
decreased. Small pleural effusions are unchanged. Left rib
fracture is stable, could be pathological in the clinical
context. Clips in the right axillary region and the left
paramediastinal region are unchanged. There is no other change.
[**2122-4-17**] Endotracheal tube in standard position. Feeding tube as
described. Rapidly evolving widespread air space opacities,
which could be due to a combination of pulmonary infection and
pulmonary edema superimposed upon underlying pulmonary
metastatic disease. ARDS is an additional consideration. Seventh
left lateral rib fracture, potentially pathologic fracture in
the setting of known breast cancer.
Echo:
[**2122-4-20**]  Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed of [**2122-4-16**], the
pericardial effusion is now apparent, but is very small.
[**2122-4-16**] Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted on [**2122-4-15**] for PDT activation.  She was
transferred to the floor overnight for observation.  She
gradually deveoped respiratory distress and was transferred to
the SICU for aggressive pulmonary toilet and nebulizers.   Her
respiratory distress increased and was taken to the operating
room and bronchscopy showed complete LMS obstruction and 80% RMS
obstruction and mechanical tumor debridement was done.  She
transferred back to the SICU intubated.  On [**2122-4-17**] she was
taken back to the operating room for further mechanical
debridement.  She had a flexible bronchoscopy on [**2122-4-18**] which
revealed a patent airway.  She was extubated.
She was hypotensive and tachycardic overnight requiring
pressors.  Cardiology was consulted and an echocardiogram showed
new wall motion abnormalities. The cardiac enzymes were
negative.  She slowly improved.   Her oxygen requirements
returned to her baseline.  She transferred to the floor on
[**2122-4-20**].  She had a repeat echocardiogram shoed good LV
systolic function EF 55% no wall abnormality.  Small pericardial
effusion.  A flexible bronchoscopy was done and further
debulking on tumor was done with therapeutic aspiration of
secretions.  Overnight she did well and was discharged to home
on [**2122-4-21**].
