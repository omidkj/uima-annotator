Admission Date:  [**2197-4-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2197-4-2**]


Service:

The patient expired on [**2197-4-2**] around 7 pm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 82-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for deep venous
thrombosis status post IVC filter, asthma, and questionable
history of atrial fibrillation.  Per daughter on the night
prior to admission, the patient attended a concert.
Following the concert, the patient "passed out."  She was
unresponsive.  She did not sustain head trauma or lose
continence of bowel or bladder.  The daughter denies that
patient has fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
The patient did have progressive shortness of breath over the
past two weeks, however.

On the Medical floor this morning, the patient was observed
to be in severe respiratory distress.  Electrocardiogram
disclosed atrial fibrillation.  Patient was required emergent
intubation, and transferred to the CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Deep venous thrombosis status post [**Location (un) 260**] filter.
2. Open reduction internal fixation of right hip in [**2195-12-8**].
3. Asthma.
4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
5. Questionable atrial fibrillation.  Echocardiogram in
[**2195-12-8**] disclosed an ejection fraction of 55%, 1+ AR,
2+ TR, left ventricular hypertrophy.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Albuterol inhaler.
2. Prilosec 20 mg a day.
3. Ambien q hs.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  Denies use of
alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.  The patient is Russian
speaking.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  Frail appearing lady,
intubated and sedated.  Vital signs:  Temperature of 94.0,
blood pressure 70/50, heart rate 112, respiratory rate assist
control 400 x12, 100%, PEEP 5, O2 saturation is 93%.  HEENT:
pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Mucous
membranes moist.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck:  Right IJ in
place.  Heart:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2, 2/6
systolic ejection murmur.  Lungs:  Poor air movement in both
lungs.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, positive
bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 5.6, hematocrit 33.7, platelets
186.  Chemistries showed a sodium of 143, potassium 3.5,
bicarb 102, chloride 28, BUN 39, creatinine of 1.7 with a
glucose of 107.  Creatinine kinase was cycled, all less than
80, troponin from 10 am on the morning of [**4-2**] was 3.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the CCU for
further management.  She was noted to be hypotensive with
systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  The patient was
initially started on dobutamine and dopamine due to initial
concern for left ventricular hypokinesis on a preliminary
echocardiogram.  Repeat echocardiogram disclosed left
ventricular hypertrophy with preservation of left ventricular
ejection fraction.  Dobutamine was discontinued and patient
was given fluid boluses.

Due to concern for hypovolemia, it was thought that patient
may require increased diastolic pressures for preserved pump
function.  Patient's blood pressure continued to decline and
she required administration of dopamine, Neo-Synephrine, and
fluids for maintenance of her pressure.  Ultimately, these
measures failed, and the patient expired on [**4-2**] at 7
pm.

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Cardiac arrest.
