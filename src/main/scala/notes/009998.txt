noncon head ct was negative. cxr reportedly negative.
EKG: NSR @90, normal axis, QRS borderline normal. no pathologic
Q waves. no ST changes. TW flattening in lateral leads esp V5,
V6. Possible U waves in lateral leads. Pt was given almost a
full 2 L IVF prior to transport. Was given CTX for UTI.
.

On arrival to the ICU, pt was stable. Was oriented to herself.
Speech somewhat garbled but healthcare worker states she is much
improved since this AM and is now closer to her baseline. She
does respond to commands and answer yes/no questions. Urine

color. Admission labs showed Creatinine down to 1.4, INR 1.1.
Lithium level was drawn, currently pending.

[**2107-4-4**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (PRELIM)
FINDINGS: No evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, edema, or mass
effect. Prominent ventricles and sulci suggest age-related
atrophy. Periventricular white matter hypodensities are
consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  The
basal cisterns appear patent and there is preservation of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation.  No fracture is identified.
The visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle
ear cavities are clear.  The globes and orbits are intact.
IMPRESSION: NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE OR MASS EFFECT.
