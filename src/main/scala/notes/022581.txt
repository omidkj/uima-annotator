History of Present Illness:
This 76 year old white male has known severe aortic stenosis,
noninsulin dependent diabetes, hyperlipidemia presented to the
ED with an abnormal sensation in his chest. The patient had been
recently diagnosed with angina. However, two days ago he began
having a sensation of tightness and irritation in his chest,
with mild pain that was different from angina. He denies any
SOB, diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting. He had this sensation
intermittently for two days, then saw his cardiologist on the
day of admission. In his cardiologist's office, he was found to
he be in atrial flutter with a ventricularrate of 150 and was
refered to the ED.

In the ED his  initial vitals were afebrile ventricular rate
110s->90's, BP: 107/68 RR:18 O2Sat:98% on 3.5Lof oxygen. He also
had intermitted chest pain with lateral ST changes on his ECG,
thought to be due to ischemia. The patient was seen by the
electrophysiology service in the ED. He received 20mg of IV
diltiazem and then was placed on a diltiazem drip. His blood
pressures dipped to the 80's systolic and the diltiazem drip was
stopped. 2 liters of IV fluids were given with normalization of
BP. However, the patient then went into respiratory distress and
a  CXR showed flash pulmonary edema. The patient was placed on
CPAP; no nitro or lasix were given due to known severe AS. The
patient was then cardioverted and was in NSR. The patient
recovered and came off CPAP. At time of admission, the patient
continued to be in NSR, denied SOB, had an SaO2 of98% on 3L NC
without  respiratory distress. The patient was also started on a
heparin drip.

Pertinent Results:
[**2127-11-5**] 10:30PM   CK(CPK)-164
[**2127-11-5**] 10:30PM   CK-MB-15* MB INDX-9.1* cTropnT-0.59*
Pre Bypass:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The number of aortic
valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Post Bypass:
The patient is AV paced and on an infusion of phenylephrine. An
aortic valve bioprothesis is in good postion with a peak
gradient of 20mmHg. Left and right ventricular function is
preserved. The aorta is intact. The remainder of the exam is
unchanged.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results
intraoperatively.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
He remained stable after admission and underwent cardiac
catheterization which confirmed critical aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**]
0.5cm2) and nonobstructive coronary disease.  Right sided
pressures were normal.  He was referred for AVR.  His pre-op
workup completed over the next few days.  A tooth extraction was
done on [**11-13**] after dental consultation.  Troponin peaked at
0.8.

He underwent surgery on [**11-14**] for AVR by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. He weaned
from bypass on phenylephrine and propofol.  He was transferred
to the CVICU in stable condition.  He remained stable and was
weaned from pressors and extubated easily. He spent an extra day
in the ICU due to elevated glucoses requiring IV insulin
infusion to control.  He was transferred to the floor on POD 3.

Following transfer he was diuresed, beta blockade was continued
for BP control and PT was initiated.  Glucoses were maintained
at satisfactory levels with oral agents and sliding scale
coverage was utilized as well.

By the time of discharge on POD 6, the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing, and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  He was discharged home in good condition.
