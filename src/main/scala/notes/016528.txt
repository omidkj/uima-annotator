History of Present Illness:
49M h/o schizophrenia, poor historian, p/w SOB, non-productive
cough, fevers and CP. States he has had a progressively
worsening non-productive cough over the last month. Denies any
subjective fevers or rigoring chills, but admits night sweats x

IMAGING:
CARDIOLOGY*****************
TTE: ([**6-25**]) The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but
cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
global function. Right ventricle is dilated, hypertrophied, and
mildly hypokinetic. No vegetations identified. If clinically
suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography
does not exclude endocarditis.
.........................
TTE: [**2109-7-2**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve is not well seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but
cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). No masses or
vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal study. No obvious vegetations identified,
but valvular structures not well visualized. If clinically
indicated, a TEE may better assess for valvular endocarditis.
Normal eft ventricular systolic function. Dilated right
ventricle with global hypokinesis. Marked resting tachycardia.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-6-25**],
the findings are similar.
...............................
TTE ([**2109-7-19**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF 60-70%) The right ventricular cavity
is dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis
