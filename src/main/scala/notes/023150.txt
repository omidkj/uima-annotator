ECHO;
GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 3 iv
injections of 8 ccs
of agitated normal saline, at rest, with cough and post-Valsalva
maneuver.

Conclusions:
The interatrial septum is bowed towards the left atrium c/w
increaed right
atrial pressure. No evidence for right-to-left shunt after
agitated saline
injection at rest, with cough, or post-Valsalva.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for PFO/right-to-left intracardiac
shunt.

CTA:
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
Prominent hilar and mediastinal nodes are seen, greater on the
right side. Heart size is enlarged with a prominent right
ventricle. The main pulmonary artery is dilated measuring 36 mm,
consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension. No central
pulmonary embolus is seen. The study is limited due to the
patient's body habitus and respiratory motion. Diffuse
ground-glass opacities are seen with areas of sparing. This may
represent asymmetric pulmonary edema versus pneumonitis versus
infection. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen. There are no pleural
effusions.

Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are stable in
appearance and better evaluated on CT abdomen from one day
prior. Osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of central PE. The study is limited due to the
patient's body habitus and respiratory motion. Segmental and
subsegmental PE cannot be ruled out.

2. Dilated main pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary
artery hypertension.

3. Diffuse pulmonary ground glass opacities with areas of
sparing, which may be due to asymmetric edema, pneumonitis, or
infection.

4. Prominent hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.

5. Bibasilar atelectasis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) 5004**] THAM


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to the
declining resp status. She was stablized then transferred to the
floor.

# Pulmonary HTN/Right sided heart failure: She was aggressively
diuresed with lasix 40mg IV BID and placed on diltiazem. As she
was grossly fluid overloaded, this regimen was increased to
lasix 40 IV TID with remarkable diuresis. She diuresed 11 liter
in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. She was started on methylprednisolone on admission,
received 3 doses, and then was placed on a rapid steroid taper.
The etiology of the pulmonary HTN was investigated: no PE by
CTA, TTE with bubble study performed - no evidence of
intra-cardiac shunt. Pulmonary was consulted as the patient sees
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic who felt that this is most likely caused
by the hernia surgery and obesity hypoventalition. Sleep
apnea/hypoventilation was managed with BIPAP at night.
Bronchoconstriction managed with nebulizer treatments as well as
prednisone. The team discussed treatment of pulmonary artery
hypertension with Pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Will not perform
right heart catheterization or start anticoagulation during this
admission.  Future consideration would be for right heart
catheterization to confirm elevated PA pressures and test for
response to vasodilator therapy; then, there would be
consideration for pulmonary artery vasodilator therapy with CCB,
but others to include endothelin receptor antagonists,
prostaglandins. The paitnet eventually was weaned down to ther
home O2 requirment and was discharged with instructions to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and resume a weightloss program.

# Acid/Base disturbance: Her baseline ABG with hypercapnia in
the 70's secondary to hypoventilation and obstructive airway
disease; chronic respiratory acidosis
with compensation. She presented with superimposed acute
respiratory
acidosis, thought to be secondary to bronchoconstriction and
variable compliance with BIPAP

# HTN: managed with home regimen

# Iron deficiency anemia: remained stable on iron replacement
therapy.
