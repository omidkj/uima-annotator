Brief Hospital Course:
# Shock/Hypotension
The patient presented with shock that did not initially respond
to fluid resuscitation so she was started on norepinephrine.
The intial concern was for septic versus cardiogenic versus
hypovolemic.  She had no fever and no obvious source of
infection, making septic shock unlikely.  Her CVP was low and a
TTE showed a hyperdynamic left ventricle with an EF >75%, no
tamponade or other evidence of cardiogenic shock.  She reported
essentially no PO intake for about two weeks, so hypovolemic
shock seemed most likely.  She has had no new medications, but
her family reports that she takes numerous dietary supplements
at home, though they do not know what these are.  She received
extensive fluid resuscitation for a total of eleven liters.  She
was weaned off of norepinephrine asymptomatically with systolic
blood pressures in the high 90s to 120s.  After having stable
blood pressures off of pressors for a day, her central venous
catheter was removed and she
