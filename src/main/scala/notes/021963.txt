Allergies:
Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
60 y/o M with PMHx of SSS s/p PCM & vertrobasilar insufficiency.
p/w recurrent syncopal episode yesterday where he sustained an
arm fracture. He was at his nursing home where he developed
sudded LOC and a fall.  He was found by the nursing home staff
on the floor. There was neither loss of bowel or bladder.  Prior
the the event he felt lightheaded, but denied diaphoresis, chest
pain or palpitations.  He presented to [**Hospital1 **] for
evaluation and was found to have a right humeral fracture. He
had a CT that was negative for ICH or mass.  He was referred to
[**Hospital1 18**] after he had a telemetry strip that was a WCT at ~100.
During that initial episode, he became transiently hypotensive
(vitals not documented) and he received a total of 2L of NS.
.
Upon  arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER his intial vitals signs were 98.7
80 120/68  22  99RA.  While in the ER he had another 2 runs of
WCT ~115 bpm with RBBB morphology.  Per the ER nursing note he
had a tele recording of HR 22O and had a percordial thump
following which the patient returned to a sinus rhythm at 96bpm.
He was given 2 doses of 150 mg of amiodarone IV.
.
Of note he just had his pacemaker interrogated in early [**Month (only) **]
[**2125**] (per patient report at [**Hospital **] Hospital) and the device was
functioning and detected no WCT.  He presented to that hospital
for a fall as well and was told that he had had a TIA but had
negative CT head.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations.

Past Medical History:
- hemorrhagic stroke [**2119**]; with residual right sided weakness;
thinks he might have had x2 strokes prior to that (x1 = loss of
vision in both eyes; second = vision split)
- DMII
- depression(requiring inpatient hospitalization in past)
- Peripheral vascular disease with known occlusion of both
carotid arteries with collaterals from the vertebrals.
- Diastolic heart failure based on C.Cath [**11-9**] showing impaired

filling, 30% diffuse narrowing LCx. - no intervention; Mild
cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction 43%, but normal
coronary arteries.
- Past polysubstance abuse and hx suicide attempts
- Hyperlipidemia
- Hypertension
- s/p Guidant pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome [**2121**]
- COPD
- s/p C5-6 laminectomy
- seizures (?): has trialed neurontin in the past--> no help
.
Cardiac Risk Factors: +Diabetes, +Dyslipidemia, +Hypertension


Social History:
Social history is significant for smoking 10 cigarettes per
day. There is a history of heavy alcohol abuse ([**1-3**] pint to 1
pint per day of vodka x 10 years), but he stopped drinking about
heavily 5 years ago. His last drink was 2 weeks ago. He lives in
a nursing home ([**Hospital 169**] Center [**Location (un) 1411**]) and used to be in
[**Hospital3 **].  He walks with a cane.

or sudden death.  Father died of MI at 86.  Mom died of MI at
72.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 73100**] is a 60 year old man with a history of recurrent
syncope, sick sinus syndrome s/p DDD pacemaker, bilateral
carotid stenosis, COPD, DM2, h/o hemorrhagic stroke, who
presented with recurrent syncope complicated by R humeral
fracture.
.
Syncope:
Head CT from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] showed no acute bleed, only hypodense
areas consistent with old infarction or injury.
Electrophysiology was consulted and his pacemaker was
interrogated, showing episodes of pacemaker mediated tachycardia
and some rate-drop episodes but no history of tachyarrhythmias.
He was thought to have vagal/reflex syncope.  He could not be
started on a volume expander due to his hypertension.  The rate
drop response was turned off to evaluate how he would do without
it but as there was no difference, it was reinstated.  He was
also started on a beta blocker, which may have some marginal
benefit.  However, it is likely that he will continue to have
syncopal episodes, as his type of neurocardiogenic syncope
cannot be well managed by either pacemaker or medications.  Pt
is at high risk of another fall [**2-3**] syncope and will need PT
evaluation at NH for [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 73101**].  Followup was
scheduled with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in Cardiology.
.
R Humeral Fracture:
X-rays demonstrated R humeral fracture.  Seen by orthopedic
trauma service.  It was determined that no operative management
was warranted for the injury.  He was fitted with a humeral
fracture brace.  Ortho's physical therapy recommendations are:
1) Pt's right arm is non-weightbearing. 2) Pt will need to
perform flexion/extension exercises twice daily of right hand &
wrist.  He will need to continue receiving heparin SC for DVT
prophylaxis as long as he is not ambulating.  Follow-up was
scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**7-26**] at 8:20AM.  Would
recommend DEXA scan as outpatient to evaluate for osteoporosis
as patient has been on long-standing steroids.
.
Pain control:
Pain management was a significant issue throughout
hospitalization.  He was initially on a dilaudid PCA, but with
poor effect.  The pain service was consulted and he was started
on oxycontin 20mg [**Hospital1 **], dilaudid 4-8mg Q3-4H PRN, acetaminophen
650mg Q6H, gabapentin 100mg QHS with little improvement per
patient.  There was concern about drug-seeking behavior.  Of
note, pt has a history of suicidal attempt after sequestering
pain medications.  However, he was observed by the nurse to be
taking his medications.  He developed constipation and was c/o
abdominal pain as he was initially refusing bowel regimen.  He
was started on a more intensive bowel regimen with subsequent
resolution and will need to continue the bowel regimen as long
