Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right thoracocentesis
Right Pleurex Catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with Afib and recurrent malignancy-related right
pleural effusion, awaiting pleurex catheter placement, who was
transferred from MICU s/p therapeutic R thoracentesis for
dyspnea.  The patient's oncologic history is significant for
CLL/SLL, metastatic prostate cancer, and a lesion consistent
with renal cell carcinoma being followed by observation since
[**2191**].  Over the past year he has had multiple admissions, most
recently two weeks prior to admission, for recurrent right
pleural effusion thought to be malignancy related.  He has had
multiple therapeutic thoracenteses, and he is scheduled for an
[**9-19**] Pleurex catheter placement.
.
He presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**9-17**] with dyspnea.  His initial
vitals were T 97.6 P 96 BP 122/54 R 24 and O2 sat 87% on RA.
CXR showed large R pleural effusion and new mild pulmonary
edema. He was placed on a nonrebreather and O2 sat increased to
100%.  He was eventually weaned to 4 L NC, breathing comfortably
and able to speak in full sentences, and was transferred to the
ICU for monitoring.  In the ICU ABG was performed:
7.53/37/63/32.  He was given lasix 40 mg at 1530 but only
produced 750 cc of UOP so 80 mg was given again at 10 pm to meet
1 L/day goal, producing another 450 cc of UOP. He had persistent
RR in 30's and was advanced to BIPAP for 4 hours beginning at 12
AM on [**9-18**].  In the morning he underwent therapeutic R
thoracentesis that yielded 1200 cc of yellow fluid.  His
respiratory function improved and he was weaned to 4 L O2.  His
most recent vitals from the MICU at 1700 were 96.8 72 106/48 21
92%/4L.  He currently reports 0/10 pain from his procedure and
reports being thirsty.
.
Of note, the patient has a history of Afib and has been holding
his coumadin for a scheduled outpatient pleurex catheter
placement on [**2194-9-20**] and has an INR from [**9-18**] of 1.2. The
patient also reports recently developing increased nocturia, had
developed lower leg edema over past year that has resolved with
starting diuretics. He sleeps on two pillows, and has some
increased exertional dyspnea that he notices when walking. He
has lost 10 lbs over the past two weeks, coinciding with an
increase to his home Torsemide dosage after his last
hospitalization.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
1. In [**2178**], he was diagnosed with CLL/SLL and has intermittently
received treatment with Leukeran since [**2185**]. He has had
occasional skin manifestations with infiltration by low-grade
lymphoma cells; however, by and large, his skin lesions have
largely been related to eczematoid skin lesions.
2. In [**2180**], metastatic prostate cancer on Casodex since [**2176**].
His PSA has been rising since [**86**]/[**2192**].
3. Stage I adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon s/p complete
resection of carcinoma in [**2187**], no recurrence since that time.
4. In [**1-/2192**], MRI for chronic kidney disease revealed a 9 mm
nodule at the medial aspect of the left renal cyst consistent
with a small renal cell carcinoma being followed by observation
alone.
5. He has had multiple admissions to the hospital for varicella
and for pneumonia.
In [**6-/2194**], he was admitted after being found to have a right
pleural effusion and was found to have anterior mediastinal
retrocrural lymphadenopathy. Given the potential risk of
complications and the very likely diagnosis of lymphoma, a
decision was made to not to perform a lymph node biopsy in the
mediastinum.
.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
# CLL likely transformed to lymphoma
# Small renal cell carcinoma, being observed
# Metastatic prostate cancer as above
# Hx stage I colon cancer - s/p L colectomy, no recurrence
# Stage IV chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine 2.5
# Hypertension
# Reported history of congestive heart failure (no recent
documentation of type or EF), records not available in our
system
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, on chronic warfarin
.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cardiac angioplasty - ~ [**2187**]
2.  Left colectomy for treatment of colon cancer.
3.  Squamous cell carcinoma removal.

Social History:
Former judge and was active in [**Location (un) 86**] politics.  Two daughters,
5 grandchildren, WWII veteran in engineering corps in Europe.

Family History:
Father with brain aneurysm (ruptured) at age 63. Brother with
brain aneurysm at age 70. Mother died of "old age" age [**Age over 90 **].

Imaging:

CXR [**2194-9-17**]
1. New mild pulmonary edema.
2. Persistent large right and small left pleural effusions, with
compressive atelectasis, particularly on the right, and [**Month/Day/Year 1192**]
cardiomegaly.
3. Osteoarthritic spurring is noted in the right shoulder.

CXR [**2194-9-18**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, a right-sided
pleural catheter has been inserted. The extent of the
pre-existing right pleural effusion has substantially decreased.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.

The lung volumes have increased. The extent of the left-sided
pleural effusion has also minimally decreased. Unchanged
[**Month/Day/Year 1192**] cardiomegaly and minimal overhydration.
