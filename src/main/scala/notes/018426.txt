Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
A 69 y/o woman with DM, HTN, HLD and HD dependent ESRD who is
transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital to the CCU for hypotension and
continued management following high risk intervention with
stents placed in the LAD and left main coronary artery.
.
According to the report the patient had been experiencing
dyspnea and weakness x 3 days which was believed to be related
to heart failure. She underwent hemodialysis on Sunday and again
on Monday to remove fluid. Today, she went for hemodyalisis and
became hypotensive to 70/50 she complained of presyncope and
dyspnea and was sent to her routine cardiology follow up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8579**] where she was hypotensive to
70/doppler and was referred to the [**Location (un) **] ED.
.
On presentation to [**Location (un) **] her vitals were 98.2 73 60/40 100%
2L, she endorsed worsening SOB but denied CP. She was started on
dopamine and dobutamine drip, and given 3L IVNS. While in the
ED, she complained of chest pain. EKG showed ventricular pacing
at 71 BPM with known LBBB, TWI in aVL. Labs were significant for
Cr. 3.0, K 2.9, Troponin I 0.61 and Hct of 30.9. She was unable
to lay flat and was intubated prior to cardiac catheterization,
which showed the patent SVG-->OM and SVG-->PDA grafts, known
occluded LIMA, RCA and LCX. A 90% L main occlusion and 80%
proximal LAD occlusion were found and 2 DES were placed. RA
pressure was 29mmHg, wedge pressure was 38mmHg.
.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management
following high risk intervention. She was received in the CCU
intubated on dopamine and dobutamine Vitals were T 95.9 HR 74 BP
95/43 O2 Sat 100%Vent settings AC 500/16/5/100% FiO2. She was
unable to contribute to the history.
.
BACKGROUND History
She has recently been treated for a chronic ulcer at the base of
her left greater toe x 1 month. She was treated [**2152-7-20**] with
baloon angioplasty to the SFA and anterior/posterior tibial
arteries were found to be occluded. PTA was incompletely opened.
Of note, on [**2152-7-20**] she underwent LLE arteriography and
angioplasty that showed total occulsion of the anterior and
posterior tibial arteries that could not be intervened upon. Her
SFA was partially occluded and was successfully dialted without
complication.
.
She has an extensive cardiac history significant for CABG
'[**39**](LIMA/LAD, SVG/OM1, SVG/RCA) c/b occlusion of LIMA/LAD graft,
s/p DES to LAD '[**46**], NSTEMI due to LAD in-stent stenosis [**2-22**] s/p
repeat DES, and AVR/MVR with [**Hospital 923**] Medical Biocor Epic Supra in
[**3-23**] and s/p pacemaker insertion. She had a recent cath at [**Hospital1 18**]
([**4-24**]) that showed 70% stenosis of the distal LMCA, 90% ostial
stenosis of the LAD, and widely patent mid arterial stents. The
LCx and RCA were totally occluded. She had a successful DES of
distal LAD and successful DES of distal L main/ostial LAD.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
septum, dyskinesis of the distal inferior wall and apex, and
severe hypokinesis of the lateral wall Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
prosthetic mitral valve leaflets are thickened. The transmitral
gradient is normal for this prosthesis. There is probable small
vegetation on the mitral valve which appe
