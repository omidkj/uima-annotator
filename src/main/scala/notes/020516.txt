Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30158**]
Chief Complaint:
hyperkalemia and fever of unknown origin



Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tunneled dialysis catheter placed by interventional radiology

History of Present Illness:
59M with hx of Alport's syndrome, ESRD on HD three times a week
who presented to the ED with hyperkalemia.   Patient was sent
here due to hyperkalemia noted at [**Hospital **] rehab.  This was most
likely due to the fact he skipped a dose of dialysis (missed
friday).  At the hospital pt. with EKG changes (EKG showed
peaked T waves and a widened QRS).  Per renal notes, pt receives
HD at [**Hospital3 **] three times a week. On [**7-4**] (?), pt was
noted to be lethargic at HD. he was sent to the [**Hospital3 **]
ER and admitted. He was found to be febrile and hypotensive with
a leukocytosis. Bld cx were drawn and antibiotics were started.
Bld cx returned negative. During that time, pt's AV fistula in
his right arm clotted off and remained so despite a thrombectomy
so a temporary? HD catheter was placed. Sources of infection
included osteomyelitis/discitis verses AVF. Per notes, pt
completed course of Vancomycin for presumed bacteremia.
.
The patient was given one amp of IV calcium gluconate and sent
to [**Hospital1 18**] ER. In the ER, a hemolyzed K returned at 9.1. He
received Calcium gluconate, Insulin/D50, one amp of bicarb and
Kayexalate.
.
Patient's brief hospital course in the ICU is below.  For his
hyperkalemia he was dialyzed and his EKG was followed.  For his
fever, cultures were drawn from his dialysis catheter, cdiff
sent and he was on vancomycin dosed by levels for < 15.  He
developed Afib with rates to 150's, he was given an additional
beta-blocker which helped.  All of his other medical problems
were stable on home meds.
.
On the floor, patient without complaints.  Denies CP, SOB,
abdominal pain, N, V, confusion, palpitations, melena, diarrhea
or constipation.  He has no complaints now.

Pertinent Results:
Initial EKG: baseline RBBB, widened QRS, peaked T waves
.
EKG after HD: RBBB, QRS and T waves improved
.
Admission CXR IMPRESSION:
1. Plate like atelectasis, left lower lobe. No evidence of
pneumonia.
2. Probable compression deformity and narrowing of
intervertebral disc space, upper lumbar spine. Clinical
correlation is recommended.
.
ECHO: Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular
wall motion appears normal (in some views the inferior wall
appears
hypokinetic but this may be due to frequent ectopy/irregular
rhythm). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is
mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation
is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade I
(mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The estimated
pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen.
.
MR L spine [**8-4**]: FINDINGS: No comparisons are available.
.
There is large area of destruction involving the L1/2 disc with
destructive end plate changes of L1 and L2. There is
heterogeneously increased T2 signal as well as diffuse
enhancement of these vertebral bodies and disc, consistent with
spondylitic discitis. There is paraspinal and epidural phlegmon
without a discrete abscess.

At T12/L1, there is a left lateral disc bulge extending from the
foramen to the extraforaminal region. There is no significant
central canal or neural foraminal narrowing at this level.

Note is made of a 1 cm gallstone.

IMPRESSION: L1/2 spondylodiscitis with paraspinal and epidural
phlegmon without a discrete abscess. The epidural phlegmon is
causing 25-50% central canal narrowing
.
Left venous upper extremity ultrasound: IMPRESSION: Intraluminal
thrombus within the left IJ vein. The remainder of the right
upper extremity veins are patent. There is a small soft tissue
fluid collection adjacent to the left shoulder, which may
represent a small post-procedure hematoma
.
CT chest [**8-7**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Osseous destruction at L1-2 with paravertebral soft tissue
consistent with osteomyelitis/discitis, better demonstrated on
recent MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2118-8-4**]. Evaluation of the central canal is
limited on CT.

2. Bilateral pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusions,
likely representing pulmonary edema, although superimposed
pneumonia is not excluded.

3. No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.

4. Gallstones, without evidence of cholecystitis.

5. Absent bilateral native kidneys and atrophic-appearing
transplant kidney, right pelvis.
.
CXR [**8-9**]: There has been a substantial increase in perihilar
pulmonary consolidation which is seen on the lateral view to lie
in the upper and middle lobes, less so in the lower. In
addition, there are discretely nodular opacities seen in the
lower lungs particularly on the right, all of which points to
disseminated infection, alternatively progressive pulmonary
hemorrhage, rather than pulmonary edema as suggested previously.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable and there is no
appreciable pleural effusion. There has been interval increase
in thickness of the right paratracheal and mediastinal soft
tissue probably combination of azygos vein distention,
mediastinal fat deposition, and some increase in central
adenopathy. Left supraclavicular dual-channel dialysis catheter
has been advanced to the lower third of the SVC. There is no
pneumothorax
.
CT chest: IMPRESSION: Worsening multilobar pneumonia, much less
likely pulmonary hemorrhage.
.
Bone scan: IMPRESSION:
1. Abnormal focal osseous uptake along the right aspect of the
L1 and L2
vertebral bodies which may represent osteomyelitis, though
non-specific. This
will be correlated to the results of the white blood cell scan
when available.
2. Marked diffuse cardiac uptake, which could be consistent
cardiac
amyloidosis.
.
WBC scan: IMPRESSION: 1. Pneumonia 2. No convincing evidence for
spinal osteomyelitis although In-111 white blood cells may have
some decrease in sensitiviy in the spine.
.
Mr of right shoulder: IMPRESSION:
1. Extremely limited examination. The patient could not complete
the study and the submitted images ar
