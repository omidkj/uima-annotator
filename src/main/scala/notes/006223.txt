Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75M with Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma s/p wedge
resection of the left upper lobe in [**6-/2125**], DM, HL, PVD, CAD
s/p 3 stents to the RCA in [**2125**], NSTEMI in [**7-/2126**] with medical
management and known 70% LMCA stenosis who p/w chest pain during
alternative medicine of vitamin C infusion. Pain substernal,
[**3-20**], non-radiating, similar to previous NSTEMI.  During the
episode of chest pain, his blood pressure was noted to be 180/60
and he took two SL NRG which resolved his chest pain. He was
evaluated at [**Hospital6 7472**] ED with no recurrence in
chest pain.  In the past 3 months, patient has had similar pain
2-3x/week with exertion and 2-3x/month at rest, relieved by SL
NTG.

At the OSH ED, vitals were T98 P93 BP128/76 RR20 92%RA. CXR
showed no acute findings. Labs were sent with a Trop <0.01, BNP
82, CRP <0.1, INR <1.08. Patient remained chest pain free and
was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]. He took two 81mg ASA this AM.

On the floor, he reports being CP free at this time and he is
without additional complaint at this time.

On review of systems, He denies any recent illnesses, and ROS
negative for cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, abdominal pain or
diarrhea. he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review
of systems is notable for absence of orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

3. ASA 81 mg [**Last Name (un) **]; Plavix 75mg daily indefinitely

ECHO [**10-1**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %) secondary to
hypokinesis of the basal-mid inferior and infero-lateral walls.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old male with Stage IV NSC Lung Cancer, CAD (NSTEMI in
[**2126**], PCI to RCA in [**2125**]) admitted with chest pain during
vitamin C infusion at OSH with CE neg x1, EKG stable, admitted
for suspicion of ACS.

# NSTEMI: Patient developed chest pain with precordial T wave
inversions while receiving a vitamin C infusion.  Enzymes were
initially negative, but troponin trended up to 0.14 and CKMB
8.5, so patient ruled in for NSTEMI.  Patient started heparin
drip and atorvastatin 80mg (DCed home simvastatin).  Continued
home Plavix, metoprolol, Imdur, lisinopril.  Patient was taken
to the cath lab where 3 stents were placed in the RCA.  During
procedure patient had Vfib arrest and was resusitated with ROSC
(see below).

# VFIB Arrest:  During cardiac cath, patient developed VFib
arrest in the setting of balloon inflation.  Patient recieved
epinephrine, lidocaine, CPR and transcutaneous defibrillation
with ROSC.  Patient was then transfered to the CCU where he was
stable, neurologically intact with no additional evidence of
ventricular arrythmia on telemetry.  He was transfered to the
floor in stable condition prior to discharge.

# PUMP/ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY: His last ECHO showed EF of
40-45% chronic systolic CHF with inferior and inferolateral
hypokinesis (post cath ECHO unchanged). Pt appeared euvolemic on
exam without pulmonary edema on CXR.  Continued metoprolol and
lisinopril as above.

# Elevated INR/PT: INR was mildly elevated to 1.3-1.4. In the
past it has been elevated to 1.2 as well. This etiology unclear,
but is most likely [**2-12**] to the large volume of homeopathic
medications he is on as an outpatient. His LFTs were wnl on
admission, making liver failure [**2-12**] metastatic burden unlikely.
