Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, extubation.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year old female with a PMH of DM2, CAD s/p CABG,
diastolic CHF, COPD on 2L home oxygen, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, PE in the past, previously on coumadin but with
history of GI and RP bleed now with IVC filter and off coumadin,
recent history of respiratory failure requiring intubation in
[**9-/2202**] secondary to MRSA pneumonia with ARDS, who presented
initially to an outside hospital with chief complaints of acute
onset headache.

Per husband, she denied neck stiffness, vision changes, chest
pain, palpitations.  Reported cough with nonproductive cough and
myalgias.  Denies any BRBPR.  No dysuria.  She was found to have
fever of 100.6 and was hypoxic with O2sats in the 70% range on
room air and was started on bipap that was poorly tolerated.
She was given vancomycin/cefepime/IV solumedrol 125mg and
nebulizers for possible PNA and COPD exacerbation.  ABG at that
time was 7.26, 85, 171 and patient was intubated.  CXR was
obtained demonstrating pulm vascular congestion.  CT head
demonstrated hydrocephalus, and when compared to CT from [**9-/2202**],
with more prominence ofthe ventricles.  Was reportedly on
levophed briefly for SBPs reportedly in the ?60s/40s but which
normalized as levophed was weaned off.  Transferred here for
further workup.

Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], intial vital signs were T: 99.4, HR: 77,
BP: 123/61, R: 18, O2sat: 100% on the vent.  Pulmonary exam was
notable for wheezing.  Due to low grade fever, headache, and
history of meningitis and inability to obtain reliable history
or physical exam, there was concern for meningitis and patient
was given 2grams ceftriaxone and another dose of 10mg IV
dexamethasone with a failed attempt at LP in the ED.  CT head
demonstrated hydrocephalus and neuro team was did not believe
that ventriculomegaly was etiology for headache.  CXR with
pulmonary vascular congestion but no obvious pneumonia.  Her
latest vent settings of AC with TV of 500X18 with FiO2: 60% and
PEEP of 8.  Found to have large amount of secretions per
respiratory.

Per report, patient was started on fluconazole about a week ago
for treatment of a body rash.

IMAGING:
[**2203-2-9**]   ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT): pending

[**2203-2-7**]   ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT):
FINDINGS: Left lateral decubitus and supine views of the abdomen
were
obtained. The study is technically limited due to patient's body
habitus. An IVC filter and cholecystectomy clips are in place.
The patient is status post vertebroplasty. The bowel gas pattern
is normal. There is no obstruction, ileus or free
intraperitoneal air.
IMPRESSION: No obstruction or free intraperitoneal air.

[**2203-2-5**]   CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
One view. Comparison with the previous study done [**2203-2-4**].
Bilateral
interstitial infiltrates likely representing edema persists. The
costophrenic sulci are indistinct. The patient is status post
median sternotomy and CABG as before. Cardiomegaly is unchanged.
An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in place.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change.

[**2203-2-4**]   CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
FINDINGS: Portable AP view of the chest was obtained. The
endotracheal tube is positioned approximately 2.8 cm above the
carina. The NG tube courses inferiorly below the left
hemidiaphragm though the distal side port is seen just below the
level of the GE junction. Patient is rotated to the right which
limits evaluation. Midline sternotomy wires are again noted with
fracture of the third sternotomy wire from the top. Mediastinal
clips are also noted.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged with mild
central congestion and likely small bilateral pleural effusions.

IMPRESSION: Tubes positioned as detailed with NG tube tip
located just beyond the GE junction - advancement is
recommended. Otherwise, unchanged.

[**2203-2-4**]   CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage
or large
mass. There is no shift of normally midline structures. The
basal cisterns are patent. There is preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
differentiation. Sulcal and ventricular prominence likely
reflects cortical atrophy which is likely secondary to
age-related involutional changes. Periventricular and
subcortical white matter hypodensity is likely sequela of
chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Visualized bony structures are grossly unremarkable.
There is mucosal thickening and possible fluid in the anterior
and posterior ethmoid air cells. Air-fluid levels are seen in
the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses bilaterally which likely
reflects the patient's intubated status.  There is partial
opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally which also
likely reflects the patient's intubated status and supine
positioning.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
