clinic appt with right shoulder/chest pain, mild hypoxia,
hypotension, and tachycardia.

The patient had gone to oncology clinic for scheduled chemo
(CD40 inhibitor study drug), when found to have new right-sided
chest/shoulder pain, hypoxia to high 80s/low 90s on RA,
tachycardia to 120s, and hypotension to 83/58. Patient describes
1 week h/o right sided pleuritic pain, fatigue, malaise, and
decreased PO intake. Some increase in chronic cough Notes this
pain is similar to symptoms of prior PNA. Also has slightly
increased right arm swelling and reported G-tube with malodorous
drainage. Denies fever, chills, diarrhea, wheezing, chest pain,
palpitations. Has some increased urinary frequency without
hematuria. He has had multiple hospitalizations in last year,

on 10 days of levaquin for bacterial superinfection ppx. Since
then he has been getting his chemo infusions, and had recently
left rehab to live at sister's house, doing well until one week.

.
In the clinic, he was given heparin bolus 5000 units for concern
of PE given increased lymphedema on right side and risk factors,
and sent to ED.
.
In the ED, the patient's initial vitals were afebrile, tachy to
120s, BP 89/60, HR 24, 96% on 4L. CXR showed persistent right
mid lung patchy opacity likely representing resolving pneumonia,
with slightly enlarged right- sided pleural effusion. CTA showed
no PE but showed increased R effusion and ground glass opacity
likely persistent resolving infection, LLL opacity increased
from prior. RUL US negative for DVT. CT abd/pelvis without
contrast showed no acute process. Given IV vanc/cefepime,
mucomyst prior to procedure, 2L NS. Labs significant for lactate
3.1, WBC 16.3 with 12 bands and 64N, Cr 2.4, LDH 262, uric acid
8.2. Patient's outpatient oncologist was made aware, pt was
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care of her sepsis, hypoxia. On
transfer, vitals were T98.9, HR120-150, 103/74, 24-28, 98% on
3L.

Patient still complaining of right sided pleuritic pain,
otherwise with no other complaints.
