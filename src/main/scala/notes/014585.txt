none


History of Present Illness:
78F transferred from NH with sudden onset of chest pain and
dyspnea.  The patient is s/p a thoracic aneurysm repair in [**5-3**]
at [**Hospital1 2177**] and has been on ventilator since then.  She was
discharged to a NH and had been doing well until this morning

140/43. Ventilator at SIMV (RR set 12, TV 600, FIO2 0.4, PEEP 5,
PS 5) satting 100% and breathing in the 20s. Appeared
comfortable. CXR showed ill-defined left lingular hazziness and
associated effusion. She was given cefipime, vanc and flagyl.

.
EKG: sinus tachycardia at 132, normal axis, normal intervals,
J-pt elevation V2-3
.
CXR: hyperinflated, hazziness in left lobe with associated
effusion
.
CXR ([**6-26**] at [**Hospital1 2177**]): compared to prior study from [**2140-6-9**], there
is persistent hazy opacity at left lung base that may represent
effusion. teh lungs are otherwise clear. the cardiomediastinal
silhouette and bony thorac are stable
.
CTA ([**6-27**] at [**Hospital1 2177**]): left lower lobe atelectasis and loculated
effusions. scattered lung nodules ranging in size from 2-7mm,
uncremarkable appearing aortic grafts
.
Echo: Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left  ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber  size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The  aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic  regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mass  or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is  seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CTA: IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Findings most consistent with multifocal pneumonia, with
areas with a tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] pattern of opacities. In additional to
usual organisms, and given the presence of granulomas, atypical
infectious etiologies should be considered.
3) Status post descending aortic aneurysm repair.
.
Chest x-ray:
IMPRESSION: Increasing opacities in left lower lobe and right
lower lobe associated with effusion, probably representing
worsening pneumonia in bilateral lower lobes.


Brief Hospital Course:
.
1. Fever: Originally, multiple potential etiologies were
considered including possible pneumonia, recent c dif, a large
sacral decub as well as likely UTI. The patient had a CXR at [**Hospital1 2177**]
at the end of [**6-2**] which showed a similar sounding hazy opacity
in left lung and a CTA which showed left lower lobe atelectasis.
 She underwent a bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 2177**] which revealed white creamy
secretions without e/o obstruction.  It is unclear if the CXR
findings here correlate with pneumonia given similar previous
findings.  Given the patient's new complaints of chest pain and
SOB as well as her new fever in this chronically ventilated
woman, we treated as [**Hospital1 **]-assoc pneumonia with cefipime and
vancomycin. Also according to family members, she  has been
treated for c dif for two months.  She also had an elevated
white blood cell count to 31 thought to be possibly secondary to
c dif and a possible failure of flagyl. Flagyl is not on
discharge summary from [**Hospital1 2177**] on [**2140-6-29**], but is present on NH med
list. We originally continued treatment here with po Flagyl but
her stool cultures returned positive for c. diff, so she was
switched to PO vancomycin. She received four days of treatment
in house. Plan is to continue treatment for total 14 days and
then to resend stool for c. diff and treat longer if needed.

Subsequent imaging indicated a multifocal pna (opacities in L
lower lobe and right lung base). The patient sputum was growing
pseudomonas,  and klebsiella and pseudomonas were growing in her
urine (she had a long standing in dwelling urinary catheter).
Initially she was placed on cefipime and vancomycin. She has
received 5 days of cefipime and 6 days of vanc before all her
culture sensitivities returned. She also had an episode of
hypotension during this time period that responded to fluid
bolus.  Sensitivities returned and all the organisms were only
sensitive to imipenem and zosyn. Patient was placed on impipenem
with plan to treat for 10 days (she recieved two days in house)
.
2. Respiratory failure: Patient has been difficult to wean from
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] family. The patient was placed SIMV at night and
CPAP+PS during the day. She was also given several trials of the
trach mask and did well on this.
.
3. Tachycardia: Likely related to infection/fever and
dehydration. Resolved with hydration. Patient had an echo with
results detailed above.  She had a CTA that was negative for PE.
.
4. Chest pain: Possibly related to pneumonia or tachycardia.
Unlikely related to ischemia as there are no convincing EKG
changes. The pain resolved promptly.
.
5. Aortic aneurysm: Long-standing. We needed to control HTN
aggressively, but we  halved her antihypertensives while
concerned for infection, and have been uptitrating her meds as
tolerated.
.
6. Anemia: Unclear baseline. HCT was stable and patient iron
studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Patient was
guiac negative
.
7. Sacral decub: Large sacral decub. Wound care RN  and plastic
consult was obtained. Plan was to continue with wound cleaning
with wound cleanser, pat dry and pack loosely with aquacel ag
and cover with dry dressing. Also, plan to apply [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor First Name *
