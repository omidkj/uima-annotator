History of Present Illness:
76 year old female with diabetes, hypothyroidism, GERD, and
hyperlipidemia admitted to [**Hospital1 **] with diarrhea, fatigue, bright
red blood per rectum and bilateral lower extremity edema on
[**2153-12-4**]. History per records as difficult for patient to
communicate while on BIPAP.
.
Initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2153-12-4**] with rectal
bleeding, low back pain, and shortness of breath.  Was
previously hospitalized in [**Month (only) 1096**] with diverticulitis and
positive blood cultures ([**2-18**]) for Strep viridans, sensitive to
penicillins.  Following that hospitalization, she was sent home
on ciprofloxacin.  Since discharge, over the course of [**Month (only) 1096**]
and [**Month (only) 404**], she has had symptoms of continued malaise, poor
appetite, and weight loss of about 10 lbs over the past couple
months.  She has been sleeping often and has had low energy.
One week prior to [**Hospital1 **] admission, she had diarrhea and noted
bright red blood in stool.  Two days prior to [**Hospital1 **] admission,
she admitted to worsening shortness of breath, leg swelling, and
family noted increasing lethargy and confusion.  She presented
to [**Hospital3 **] with these complaints.  Blood cultures drawn
on [**12-4**] grew out an alpha hemolytic strep species with final
culture data pending.  She was placed empirically on IV
ceftriaxone.  She was not febrile during her hospital stay and
felt symptomatically improved after antibiotics were started.
An echo done at [**Hospital1 **] revealed aortic stenosis but no
vegetation or vavulopathy was noted.  Stool was tested given
diarrhea history but this was negative for clostridium
difficile.   Her laboratory analysis was remarkable for
creatinine of 2 with baseline of 0.6; her white count peaked at
11,600.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

STUDIES:
.
ADMISSION CXR:No previous images. Enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette with substantial pulmonary edema. Left pleural
effusion with compressive
atelectasis is also seen.
.
TTE [**12-10**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is a moderate-sized probable vegetation (~0.8 cm diameter)
on the aortic valve. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is (~0.5
cm) small mobile structure consistent with possible vegetation
on the mitral valve. There is mild functional mitral stenosis
(mean gradient 4 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Echodense mobile structure on the aortic valve
consistent with probable vegetation. There is also a smaller
mobile structure on the mitral valve which may also be a
vegetation. Preserved biventricular systolic function. Mild
aortic regurgitation and at least moderate mitral
regurgitation.Mild mitral inflow gradient associated with mitral
annular calcification.
.
TEE [**12-12**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. Normal interatrial septum by color doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the arch and descending thoracic aorta
down to 35cm from incisors. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Significant aortic stenosis cannot be
excluded. There is a 0.8mm long echodensity on the LVOT side of
the the non-coronary leaflet of the aortic valve c/w a
vegetation. Moderate to severe aortic regurgitation is seen. No
aortic valve abscess is seen. The mitral valve leaflets is
mildly thickenedl. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid
leaflets are normal with trivial tricuspid regurgitation. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate sized, mobile echodensity on the
non-coronary leaflet of the aortic valve consistent with
vegetation. Moderate to severe aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
.
HEAD MRI [**12-12**]:
1. Punctate focus of high DWI/low ADC signal in the medial right
post-central sulcus. This might be secondary to suceptability
affect from adjacent pial siderosis described below. However, a
small acute to subacute cortical infarct or related to septic
emboli is possible. Assessment is somewhat limited due to lack
of IV contrast. Followup as clinically indicated.

2. Linear loss of signal on susceptabilty within the right
central sulcus and left post-central sulcus is suggestive of
pial siderosis in the setting of prior subarachnoid hemorrhage.
A few tiny scattered foci of negative susceptibility in the
