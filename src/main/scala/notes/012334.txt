Final Report
LEFT KNEE, TWO VIEWS

HISTORY: 76-year-old female status post ascending aortic
dissection; ? septic
joint.

FINDINGS: Limited study, with frontal and cross-table lateral
views, is
compared with the radiographs of [**2145-8-5**]. There is now a
relatively large
suprapatellar joint effusion, with diffuse, circumferential
swelling of the
overlying soft tissues. However, there is no cortical
discontinuity,
periosteal new bone formation, or medullary lucency to
specifically suggest
osteomyelitis. There is osteoarthritis involving the lateral
compartment with
joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis and marginal
osteophyte
formation, as before.

IMPRESSION: Soft tissue swelling and relatively large
suprapatellar joint
effusion, significantly more marked since the [**7-/2145**]
radiographs. In this
clinical context, septic arthritis remains a concern. No frank
bone
destruction is seen.

Approved: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**2145-12-3**] 10:06 AM
ECHO

PRE-CPB:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
atrium is moderately enlarged.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
free wall function.

The ascending aorta is severely dilated. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. A mobile density is seen in the
ascending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection. This flap extends to the abdominal aorta as far is
it can be visualized. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of study.

POST-CPBx1:
The patient is on a norepinephrine infusion. Biventricular
systolic function is preserved. The left ventricle appears
small, consistent with hypovolemic state. There is no residual
dissection in the aortic root. The aortic insufficiency remains
trace.

POST-CPBx2:
The patient is on norepinephrine and low dose epinephrine
infusions. Biventricular function remain unchanged. Estimated
LVEF is 55%. The left ventricle continues to appear small.

There is brightly echogenic material seen in the ascending
aorta, consistent with ascending tube graft. There is trivial
aortic insufficiency. The dissection flap is again visualized in
the distal arch and descending aorta.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 98305**] presented with Ascending aortic dissection. She
was taken to the operating room emergently and underwent
replacement of ascending and hemiarch aorta with a 28 mm
Gelweave graft under hypothermic circulatory arrest with
selective antegrade cerebral perfusion with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cross clamp
time was 101 minutes +54 minutes.  Pump time was 145 minutes +73
minutes. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest time was 32
minutes. Selective antegrade cerebral perfusion was 26 minutes.
Please see operative report for further details. She weaned from
bypass on Epinephrine and Levophed. She was transferred to the
CVICU intubated and sedated in critical condition.
Postoperatively she was coagulopathic and required multiple
blood products.  She returned to the Operating Room for
reexploratopn that night where  bleeding from the distal
anastamosis was easily controlled.  The chest was left open and
she returned to the ICU in stable condition.
She had increased ventilatory requirements initially and
aggressive diuresis was undertaken.  She remained stable and
diuresed well.  Her renal function remained stable and her
ventilation requirement decreased.  She was kept intubated,
sedated and paralyzed.
On [**2145-11-22**] she returned to the Operating Room where the chest was
easily approximated and closed. Paralytics and versed and
Fentanyl were discontinued then and Propofol used for sedtion.
She remained hypertensive and Nicardipine was initiated. She
went into repid atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion. She
weaned off Nicardipine and was started on
beta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin.
On [**2145-11-24**] Left internal jugular and right cephalic thrombus seen
on ultrasound. Vascular team was consulted and removal of the
left subclavian catheter, anticoagulation with heparin was
recommended along with transition to Coumadin. The length of
Coumadin anticoagulation should be 3 to 6 months.
Postoperatively Mrs.[**Known lastname 98305**] had worsening thrombocytopenia. She
tested positive for Heparin PF4 Antibody Test by [**Doctor First Name **]. Heparin
was discontinued. Argatraban drip was initiated and
anticoagulation with Coumadin continued. Her thrombocytopenia
improved.
She was slow to wean off the ventilator due to her acute on
chronic diastolic heart failure requiring aggressive diuresis
for pulmonary edema. Tube feeding was initiated for nutritional
support.  POD#9 she successfully weaned to extubation. She
remains on nebulizers and diuresis. Her feeding tube was d/c'd
and she was able to take nutrition orally with encouragement.
The following day she was transferred to the step down unit for
further monitoring. Physica
