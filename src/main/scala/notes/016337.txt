History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 64 yo female with pmh of asthma, COPD on 3 L NC,
dCHF, a.fib, hx of DVT, and htn admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to
hyperkalemia and concern for her tenuous respiratory status.
She was in her USOH until the night prior to admission when she
developed dyspnea.  Denies fevers or CP, but does admit to a
productive cough for two days.  She had not taken any
medications this morning.  She states for the past few days she
had decreased po intake due to a general feeling of unwellness.
She has continued to eat a banana a day.  She admits to recent
rhinorrhea, and pain after finishing urination as well as
polyuria.  Has stable orthopnea, denies PND or new lower
extremity edema.  No recent sick contacts.
.
She took 50 mg po prednisone at home the night before admission
and nebs x 2, however her symptoms worsened so this morning she
called EMS.  EMS gave her combivent, Mag, and terbutaline.
.
In the ED, her initial vs were: T 98.4  P 106  BP 165/98  R 25
O2 sat  90-92% on RA, 98% on 5L.  She was given solumedrol 125
mg IV once and multiple neb treatments.  She had a CXR which was
found concerning for PNA so she was given 750 mg po
levofloxacin.  A VBG showed a K of 8 which was confirmed by
peripheral [**Hospital Unit Name **].  Her inital EKG had a widened QRS and peaked
T-waves so she was given 10 mg IV insulin, 1 amp D50, 1 amp
sodium bicarb, and 1 gm calcium gluconate all x 2 with eventual
improvement in her EKG findings.  She was also given 60 grams of
kayexalate and had one bowel movement prior to leaving the ED.
Right before she left she also had a repeat K of 7.3
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she states her dyspnea has improved
somewhat at rest, but she still gets dyspneic with movements.
She continues to feel that her muscles are weak, although this
is somewhat better from this morning.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
64yo with history of COPD and atrial fibrillation was admitted
with shortness of breath found secondary to pneumonia triggering
COPD exacerbation. She was also found to have acute renal
failure with creatinine to 1.8 associated with a Klebsiella
urinary tract infection and marked hyperkalemia to K 8.4.

1. Acute exacerbation of COPD
The patient was found to have a pneumonia, the likely trigger of
her Asthma/COPD exacerbation.  She was started on Levofloxacin
for treatment of community acquired pneumonia and given a dose
of IV steroids in the ED.  In the ICU, ceftriaxone was added to
her antibiotic regimen, and she was started on oral prednisone,
starting at a dose of 60mg and continued on nebulizers.  Ms.
[**Known lastname **] does have a history of diastolic heart failure and
presented with an elevated BNP in the 3000s; however, she was
found to be dry clinically and was not believed to have an acute
exacerbation of her heart failure.  Her BNP was likely elevated
as a result of right heart strain in the setting of acute
pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.  The patient has a baseline O2
requirement of 3L on nasal cannula at home; she was saturating
at 98-100% on 2L nasal cannula upon discharge. She is to
complete a 5 day burst of prednisone 60mg daily from
[**Date range (1) 51720**]/09. After she completes the 5 day course of 60mg
daily, please continue her on a prolonged taper of steroids. She
is also on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for treatment of
community acquired pneumonia. Please continue treatment to
complete a 7 day course from [**Date range (1) 111062**].

2. Acute renal failure:
The patient's baseline Cr is 0.9 - 1.1, and her Cr in the ED was
found to be elevated to 1.8.  Her history suggests that she had
poor PO intake for several days prior to admission; her ARF was
likely of prerenal etiology and secondary to continued diuretic
use in the setting of decreased PO intake.  Her lasix and
aldactone were held on admission. Patient has a history of
diastolic heart failure and remarkable lower extremity edema in
the past. Lasix should be restarted in the next few days, as her
creatinine improves and if she develops any lower extremity
swelling.

3. Hyperkalemia:
The patient's K was found to be 8.4 on her admission [**Date range (1) **].  She
was taking KCl 20 mg po bid and aldactone 100 mg po daily as an
outpatient which likely contributed to her hyperkalemia in the
setting of ARF.  She was treated for her hyperkalemia in the ED
with insulin, dextrose, bicarbonate, kayexalate, and calcium
gluconate.  The patient did have EKG changes showing widening of
the QRS complexes in the ED, but these changes resolved with the
treatment she received in the ED.  She was admitted directly to
the ICU, where she was treated with further insulin, dextrose,
bicarbonate, adn kayexalat
