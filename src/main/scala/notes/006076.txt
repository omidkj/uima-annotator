CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2156-11-2**] 5:50 PM

FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest. The lateral view is
technically limited by patient positioning. Cardiac silhouette
enlargement is again noted. There is interval partial
improvement in pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion.
There is an equivocal increase in retrocardiac density on the
technically limited lateral view, which may represent pneumonia.
The visualized osseous structures appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Partial improvement in congestive heart failure.
2. Equivocal increased retrocardiac density which may represent
pneumonia.

CHEST CT [**11-4**]

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Enlarged main pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary
arterial hypertension.
3. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation, most pronounced
posteriorly with other ill-defined patchy opacities bilaterally.
Given the distribution, aspiration may be considered.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2156-12-9**] 9:55 AM

IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.
2. Vague left lower lobe opacity representing atelectasis versus
early pneumonia.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2156-11-24**] 1:11 PM
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST.

INDICATION: Patient with acute renal failure and sepsis. Rule
out intra- abdominal abscess
CONCLUSION:
More advanced consolidation within both lung bases, and
involving most segments of the right lung.
No intra-abdominal source of sepsis.

Echo [**2156-11-5**]
Conclusions:
No evidence of atrial septal defect identified with 2 rest
injections of
agitated saline contrast (patient unable to cooperate with
maneuvers). However, views were technically suboptimal.
Biventricular systolic function appears grossly intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
42 y.o male w/ MR/Down's, asthma and no cardiac hx, p/w DOE, LE
edema, URI/cough

1) Repsiratory failure: Dyspnea/Hypercarbia.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] carried
a diagnosis of asthma (no known PFTs) for 1 year and had been on
MDI, singulair, montelukast.  It is clear from his risk factors
and observed apnea in the hospital that he most definitely has a
large component of sleep apnea.  When he was admitted he was
thought to have pulmonary edema based on mild lower extremity
edema and rales on lung exam as well as cardiomegaly and upper
zone redistribution on CXR and BNP of 929.  He ruled out for
ACS.  He was initially diuresed 1 liter and looked somewhat
improved.  However, on [**11-3**] at 1PM he was noted to be somnolent
after eating some crackers.  His O2 sat was 91% on 2L N.C. and
his ABG was 7.27/83/81 demonstating marked hypercapnia.   He
placed on nasal,then full CPAP mask with some improvement in his
hypercapnia, but still was profoundly somnolent.  He was
intubated after 6 hours on CPAP without improvement in blood gas
or alertness.  After intubation, a CT Chest with constrast was
performed.  This demonstrated b/l LL infiltrates in a pattern
consistent with aspiration as well as pulmonary artery
enlargement consistent with Pulm HTN.  There was no evidence of
PE.  A Bronch/BAL was performed on [**2156-11-4**], which was
essentially normal.  Sputum samples are negative to date.  He
was empirically treated with levoflox and flagyl. This coverage
was broaded to include Zosyn for a short duration
Pt eventually grew serratia from his sputum culture on [**11-9**]
(pan-sensitive) and for several sputum cultures following.  He
was treated with meropenem for a total of 14 days.  Within
48hours of discontinuation of meropenem, the patient dropped his
blood pressure, had increased WBC count, and had worsening of
his respiratory status.  His meropenem was restarted and he
remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  A subsequent
sputum culture showed rare growth of serratia.  He will complete
a 14 day course that will finish on [**2156-12-16**].

Pt had VRE postive blood culture on [**11-25**].  He was started on
linezolid course for 2 weeks which completed on [**2156-12-10**].
Surveillance blood cultures were negative.  The patients right
IJ line was resited to the left using u/s guidance.

The patient had a prolonged intubation characterized by high
peep requirement with difficulty weaning with desaturations due
to loss of recruitment when PEEP was weaned to less than 14.  Pt
has improvement in his renal function and was diuresed multiple
liters of fluid with significant improvement of pulmonary edema.
On [**12-6**] and [**12-7**] pt did well with reduction of PEEP and was
reduced to a PEEP of 1- with preservation of adequate
oxygenation.  Thoracic surgery was consulted and a tracheostomy
was done on [**12-8**] without complication (6.0 Portex tube). A PEG
tube was placed at that time as well.  Pt did well after surgery
and was weaned to intermittent trach mask with getting patient
out of bed.  He will continue to wean to trach mask at rehab.

2)Cardiomegaly: Initially the patient was thought to have
pulmonary edema and left-sided heart failure.  An Echo on [**11-3**]
demonstrated EF of 75%, RV dilation, mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**] and
symmetric LVH.   There was no evidence of VSD or ASD (more
common in patients with Down's Syndrome.  The CT Chest did not
demonstrate effusions and diuresis seemed to have minimal effect
