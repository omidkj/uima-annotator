Intra-op TEE [**2123-11-1**]
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is AV-Paced, on no inotropes.
Preserved biventricular systolic fxn. Mild MR, no AI.
Aorta intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2123-11-1**] where
the patient underwent CABG x 3.  See operative note for details.
 Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Wellbutrin SR was initiated for smoking cessation.  Chest tubes
and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 4, the patient was ambulatory, yet deconditioned, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged to [**Location (un) 44563**] in [**Hospital1 10478**] in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
