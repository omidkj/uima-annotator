Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 36F with a past medical history of mental
retardation with Angelmann syndrome, Antiphospholipid antibody
syndrome, CAD s/p STEMI, systolic heart failure with EF of 20%
who presents from her group home with shortness of breath. Per
health aide for the past month has been having progressively
worsening dyspnea, noted to be grunting, leaning forward when
walks and in bed, tachypnea. Has been eating mostly pizza all
week but today refusing to eat. Had episode of non-bilious
vomitting x1. ROS unable to obtain but denies recent fever. Sent
to PCP (has seen several times in past month), who referred to
ED. Unclear how many pillows sleeps on. Believes that weight
stable. No recent change in meds, compliant with meds.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.5 101 103/61 30 100. BNP of 2800
(up from 1000 in [**2148**]), supratherapeutic INR of 8.0. CXR showed
bilateral pleural effusions. EKG unchanged, initial troponin
negative. She was given lasix 40IV and ativan 2mg x2. Trying to
obtain CT head but unable to lie flat [**3-11**] orthopnea. Maintaining
sats, tachynpic and looked tired so put on CPAP. Vitals on
transfer: 106  101/61 22 100% on CPAP 40%
.
On the floor, patient's caregiver reports that looks much better
with less grunting and more comfortable.

Imaging:
CXR ([**8-29**]): IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with severe
congestive heart failure,
bilateral pleural effusions also present.

KUB ([**8-29**]): IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern, with no
evidence of obstruction or
ileus.

ECHO ([**9-4**]): The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinning and akinesis
of the anterior, anteroseptal and apical segments. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 20%). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. Mild to
moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w remote proximal LAD infarction. Mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-7-25**],
pulmonary hypertension is not seen (likely secondary to
technically-suboptimal images). The other findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
36yo F with a past medical history of mental retardation with
Angelmann syndrome, Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, CAD s/p
STEMI, systolic heart failure with EF of 20% who presents from
her group home with shortness of breath most likely due to
decompensated heart failure.

#Shortness of breath: Patient has a history of CHF with an EF
20%. Upon presentation, she demonstated evidence of fluid
retention on exam, elevated BNP, and effusions c/w severe CHF on
CXR. Precipitant for CHF exacerbation remains unclear, but there
was a report from group home that patient had consumed excessive
pizza in days PTA. No evidence of ischemia, as there were no
changes on EKG and no bump in troponins. No evidence of
infection, as all cultures were negative. The patient improved
clinically over the course of her hospital stay with IV lasix.
An ECHO from [**9-4**] showed severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, c/w remote proximal LAD infarction and
mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
.
#Anemia: Likely [**3-11**] AOCD, given low iron, elevated ferritin and
decreated TIBC. HCT remained stable at 27-29. Baseline appears
to range from 25-30 based on past admission data. No evidence
acute blood loss.
.
#Supratherapeutic INR: The patient presented with an INR of 8.0.
She was given 2mg of vitamin k in the ICU. Her coumadin was
held, and the INR trended down to 1.3. After discussions with
hematology, it was decided that she would be bridged with
lovenox given her history of antiphospholipid syndrome. The goal
is INR [**3-12**]. The reason for the supratherapeutic INR at
presentation is unclear, as she is given the prescribed dose of
coumadin by the staff at her group home. She will need to be
monitored as an outpatient.
.
#Antiphospholipid Syndrome: The patient was supratherapeutic at
presentation. When her INR dropped to 1.3, she was bridged with
lovenox to reach goal of [**3-12**].
.
#Hx of Seizures: No evidence of any current seizure activity.
Carbamazepine level was 5.8 during admission.
