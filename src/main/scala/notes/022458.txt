presents with four days of dyspnea, fatigue, and melanotic
stools. Patient denies prior history of GI bleed. He has no
abdominal pain, denies use of NSAIDs other than 81mg ASA. Of
note, he had a recent foot surgery on [**11-25**], for which he took
four "pain pills" on [**11-26**] (unsure what kind, but doesn't believe
it had ibuprofen/ ASA product), and none after that time. On ROS
does note dull chest pressure w/ minimal exertion x 2 days,
though not able to decide if it is similar to his heartburn.

Po2 100%. He was noted to have black guaiac positive stool on
rectal exam. NG lavage initially was clear, then noted to have a
pink frothy color. NG lavage was then stopped, but upon speaking
with GI, they requested a liter of fluid be lavaged. The ED
resident then lavaged an additional 300cc of fluid, which was
clear. NG has now been placed to intermittent suction. The
patient had a EKG which was reportedly NSR at 96. CXR was
normal. Patient was given protonix 80mg IV x 1. Also received
500cc normal saline, not transfused any blood. 2 18-gauge PIV's
were placed. He remained hemodynamically stable the entire time
he was in the ED with systolic blood pressures ranging 130's to
150's. Vital signs on transfer to the ICU were: 97.3, 130/52,
94, 19, 98RA.

Imaging:
Portable CXR: No acute intrathoracic process. Emphysema,
calcified pleural
plaque. Second image demonstrates placement of an NG tube,
though distal tip is not included in the imaged field.

EGD:
Hiatal hernia noted with small erosions at the site. No active
bleeding visualized.
Erythema and erosion in the whole stomach compatible with
Erosive gastritis
Angioectasia in the duodenum (thermal therapy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
76 year-old man presented Upper GIB and significant blood loss.
He was hemodynamically stable through his stay.  However given
the seemingly acute nature of his low Hct he was transfused 3
units of pRBCs. Hct rose appropriately to 3 units and remained
stable.  EGD demonstrated hiatal hernia with a small erosion
making erosive gastritis the most likley source of bleeding.
AVMs were also noted in the duodenum and potentially more
distally.  Outpatient capsule endoscopy was recommended.  He was
started on treatment for positive HPylori antibody. He was
monitored overnight with stable hematocrit.   He was discharged
the following day.

Incidentally he had atypical chest pain during his
hosptialization and was ruled out of MI with two sets of
negative cardiac markers.

Code status was discussed during this hospitalization.  Patient
acknowledged that he did not want resucitation, but would be OK
to intubate in setting of airway protection or if could preserve
functional status, but would not want to be on a ventilator for
a long period of time.  His HCP is his son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 84037**].

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname **]

It was a pleasure to care for you during your hospitalization.
You were admitted for large amounts of bleeding from your
stomach.  You had an endoscopy which showed significant
gastritis which is likely the cause of your bleeding.  You were
started on an acid suppressing medication and your symptoms
improved. You should continue on this medication day as
prescribed to allow healing of the stomach.

It is likely that the reason for the gastritis is an infection
caused by Helicobacter Pylori.  You were started on an
antibiotic regimen to treat this infection.  Please complete the
treatment regimen as prescribed.  Do not take simvastatin for
two weeks until the antibiotic course is complete due to d
