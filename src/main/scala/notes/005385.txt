[**2153-5-22**] 10:40AM BLOOD CK(CPK)-51. Selectove coronary
angiography of this left dominant system
demonstrated no significant CAD. The LMCA and LAD were without
angiographic evidence of CAD. The LCX was diminutive and
non-dominant.
The RCA was a large dominant vessel without angiographic
evidence of
CAD.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated
left sided
filling pressures with LVEDP=16 mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography was limited by ectopy but systolic
function
appeared normal with an ejection fraction visually estimated to
be 60%.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Normal left ventricular systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for cardiac catheterization after chest pain.
Transferred to CCU for aspirin desensitization.

CCU course:

1. Aspirin desensitization: She was monitored in the CCU during
the desensitization protocal.  She was premedicated with
benadryl and solumedrol.  She received 10 increasing doses of
aspirin over 90 minutes.  She tolerated the procedure well
without any asthmatic symptoms.
.
2. Chest pain: She was initially maintained heparin,
integrillin, plavix, and lipitor.  She also received 325 of
aspirin at the end of the desensitization protocal.  After the
desensitization, she had recurrent chest pain that was identical
to her previous chest pain.  Her EKG still had slight ST
elevations in V4-V6.  Her cardiac enzymes remained flat.  She
received 2 SL nitroglycerin, 1 mg morphine, and 1 mg ativan.
She dropped her pressure to 80 systolic and received a 500cc
fluid bolus.  She was started on a nitro drip with resolution of
her chest pain.  Given that her EKG changes were borderline and
given that her enzymes remained flat, her pain was thought not
to be cardiac.  Therefore, her heparin and integrillin was
stopped.  She was maintained on nitro drip as that controlled
her pain.  Plan for catherization on Tuesday.

[**Hospital1 **]:  Transferred to [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-21**] without complications.  No
chest pain, shortness of breath or complaints [**Date range (1) 18468**].

arteries.  Tolerating PO.  Hemostasis obtained.
