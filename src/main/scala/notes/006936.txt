History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69yo F with PMH Hep C cirrhosis currently on the
tranplant list recently admitted [**Date range (1) 80525**] for SBP who is

issues with medication compliance. She feels well overall,
without any acute concerns. Her abdomen has not increased in
size lately.

Brief Hospital Course:
69F with HCV cirrhosis recently admitted with acute on chronic
kidney injury concerning for HRS and hyponatremia. Hyponatremia
resolved with hydration. She became oliguric with rising Cr
despite this octreotide/midodrine and was initiated on dialysis
[**12-1**].

LFTs worsened. Liver ultrasound revealed  new non-occlusive
portal vein thrombosis.  Liver function continued to worsen.
Heparin drip was started after an EGD was performed to establish
risk of bleeding varices. Grade [**11-19**] varices with no signs of
bleeding were noted.

On [**2159-12-2**], an ABO incompatible donor liver offer was accepted
and she underwent orthotopic liver transplant from donor with
blood type A (she is Type B). Plasmapheresis was done prior to
OR. She had a significant coagulopathy and abdomen was unable to
be closed. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Please refer to
operative notes for complete details. She was sent intubated to
the SICU for management postop. Plasmapheresis was performed on
postop day 1. Liver duplex exam was limited, but demonstrated
patent vasculature within the right lobe of liver. Left lobe
hepatic vasculature and extrahepatic vessels could not be
assessed. LFTs increased. JP drainage was bilious.

Anti A titers were in the 1-4 range and plasmapheresis was
stopped. A total of 7 doses of ATG were given. Immunosuppression
consisted of Cellcept, Solumedrol and Prograf per trough levels.
She was taken back to the OR on [**12-4**], for exploratory
laparotomy, splenectomy, and choledochocholedochostomy.

Blood cultures were sent for serum WBC elevation. Enterococcus
faecium was isolated from blood on [**12-10**]. Vancomycin was
initially started then switched to Daptomycin when sensitivities
isolated VRE. Dapto continued until [**1-10**] then was switched to
Linezolid on [**1-10**].

LFTs improved, but bilirubin remained elevated. On [**12-12**], a liver
duplex was done to evaluate for hyperbilirubinemia noting large
peri- and subhepatic collection which appeared to be a partially
liquefied and partially organized.

On [**12-13**], an ERCP was performed for evaluation of bacteremia in
setting of large peri-hepatic / subhepatic fluid collection seen
on ultrasound. The biliary anastomosis was angulated but
appeared patent. No intervention was done. Alk phos increased
and liver biopsy was done on [**12-16**] which showed bile duct
proliferation. Bilious drainage was noted in JP.

On [**2159-12-18**], she was taken to the OR for liver transplant for
exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of hematoma and washout liver
biopsy. A tracheostomy was also performed as she had been
intubated for 15 days.

She remained vented and repeat ERCP was performed on [**12-31**] with
finding of anastomotic stricture in the mid bile duct and
moderate bile extravasation of the level of the stricture
confirming bile leak. A sphincterotomy was performed with
placement of a  7cm by 10FR biliary stent.  Good bile flow was
noted after stent placement. Feeding tube was placed and feeds
were continued. She transferred out of the SICU after 26 days.

She was febrile on [**1-2**] and was transferred back to the SICU for
hypotension. Blood cultures isolated fairly resistant
Klebsiella. CVL tip culture isolated VRE. Zosyn was started then
was switched to Colistin after 3 days. Colistin continued for 4
more days when sensitivities revealed [**Last Name (un) **] sensitivity.
Meropenum was started on [**1-8**] and continued for a total of 2
weeks. Repeat blood cultures were negative.

Bilious JP output diminished. However, this increased again as
well as serum WBC. ERCP was done again on [**1-15**]. Extravasation
was noted at the main biliary tree, at or just below the
anastomosis. Otherwise, biliary tree was normal. Two 7cm by 10FR
Plastic stents biliary stents and [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric feeding tube were
placed under Fluoro. She remained in the SICU for 10 days. She
was anuric and CVVHD continued until [**1-10**] when she was switched
to intermittent HD.

On [**1-2**] thoracentesis was done for large pleural effusion with
1200cc removed. Culture was negative. A pigtail catheter was
placed on [**1-10**] for re accumulation. Pigtail was remo
