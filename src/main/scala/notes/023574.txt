Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD at outside hospital

History of Present Illness:
51 y.o. male with history of alcholism, HTN,
hypercholesterolemia who is now being transferred from OSH for
further work-up of severe GIB.
.
Patient has a history of severe alcoholism, reporting up to 7
shots of Tequilla per day and recently went on a drinking binge
for approximately 13 days prior to presentation to [**Hospital3 12748**]. During this time, he is reported to have
become progressively weaker and had one episode of hematemesis.
He additionally is reported to have aspirated his emesis, though
his sister knows of no resultant fevers, cough, SOB and denies
any recent travel or sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] largely isolated
himself during this time so little is known of the events that
took place. He was urged to go to the hospital at several times,
to include when he experienced hematemesis, but patient denied.
He has a history of poor follow-up with doctors. Patient finally
presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] on [**6-29**] where he was
initially hypoxic, tachypneic and hypotensive to SBP in the 60s.
He was urgently intubated, started on pressors and admitted to
the ICU for further management.
.
During this hospitalization, patient was found to be in renal
failure with BUN of 288 and creatinine of 19.9. He also had a
metabolic acidosis from renal failure and lactic acidosis from
presumed, prolonged hypoxia/hypoperfusion. Since he was aniuric
in this setting, HD was initiated through a temporary groin
line. Additionally, an EGD was performed given history of
alcoholism and report of hematemesis and hypoxia on presentation
and this revealed an esophageal ulcer that was injected with 10
ccs of epinephrine and clipped x 2. It was felt that this would
only be a temporizing measure so patient was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation, namely from IR and thoracics.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was intubated, sedated and on
Levophed, Neosynephrine and Vasopressin. An a-line was placed
and stat imaging showed bilateral lung infiltrates and dilateld
loops of small bowel. A repeat EGD was performed on [**7-7**], which
demonstrated a clipped GE jxn ulcer, and a few gastric fundus
ulcers, all were nonbleeding. After careful discussion wtih GI
and surgery, an OG tube was placed as a last resort to
decompress the small bowel. Patient received 1 unit of PRBCs, 1
unit of platelets as well as 1 unit of FFP.

Past Medical History:
Alcoholism
CAD
HTN
Hyperlipidemia
History of Vicodin abuse, on Methadone
DVT and PE s/p IVC filter
DM
Depression
Suicidal Ideations
Obesity
Chronic Renal Failure (creatinine of 1.3 - 1.7 in '[**44**])

Social History:
History of tobacco (1 ppd x 30 years), ETOH with several
Tequilla shots/day, but no history of DTs, history of Vicodin
abuse, on Methadone. Used to live with wife and 3 children and
own his own furniture store; recently, his wife divorced him and
placed a restraining order, banning him from the househould. His
mother wishes to claim gaurdianship over him. At this point, the
patient does not have a certain household to which he would
ultimately be discharged. Mother/sister have attempted Section
35 last fall, which was unsuccesful.

Pertinent Results:
KUB ([**7-1**]): Single portable view of the abdomen without prior
imaging for comparison reveals multiple distended loops of small
bowel. There is relative paucity of gas within the colon.
Findings are suggestive of possible mechanical small-bowel
obstruction. IVC filter and right-sided femoral central venous
catheter incidentally identified.

CXR ([**7-1**]): Endotracheal tube has been placed with tip
terminating 4 cm above the carina. Left internal jugular
catheter has been placed with tip terminating in the
proximal-to-mid superior vena cava, with no pneumothorax. Right
PICC has apparently been removed. Cardiac silhouette is mildly
enlarged, and there is new combined alveolar and interstitial
pulmonary edema, likely due to fluid overload, accompanied by
small bilateral pleural effusions. Mild-to-moderate
gastric distension has developed with prominence of the gastric
folds noted.

Abdominal U/S ([**2147-7-3**]):
1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other
forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on
this study.
2. No gallstones and no signs of cholecystitis. No biliary
dilatation.
3. Mild splenomegaly.
4. Trace of ascites.
5. No hydronephrosis.

TTE ([**2147-7-3**]):  The left atrium is elongated. A patent foramen
ovale is present with right-to-left passage of microbubbles post
Valsalva release, but no flow at rest. . Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function.
Patent foramen ovale.

EEG ([**2147-7-2**]):  Abnormal portable EEG due to the abnormal
background consisting of disorganized low voltage fast activity
with admixed theta
and delta frequency activity in the posterior regions
bilaterally. The findings are consistent with a moderate to
severe encephalopathy and suggestive of dysfunction of bilateral
subcortical or deep midline structures. Medications, metabolic
disturbance, and infection are among the common causes of the
encephalopathy, but there are others. There were no areas of
prominent focal slowing although encephalopathic patterns can
sometimes obscure focal findings. There were no clearly
epileptiform features. No electrographic seizure activity was
noted. If of clinical interest, the study can be repeated in
absence of sedative medicatoins for a better assessment of the
background.

EGD [**7-7**]:
Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Ulcer in the gastroesophageal junction
Erythema and congestion in the stomach compatible with gastritis
Ulcers in the fundus
No gastric or esophageal varicies were seen.
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Recommendations: [**Hospital1 **] proton pump inhibitor
check H. Pylori serology
Treat for H. Pylori if biopsy positive
Repeat EGD if acutely rebleeds
EGD in [**8-22**] weeks
Additional notes: Source of bleeding appears to be gastric
ulcers.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS ([**2147-7-10**]): No deep venous thrombosis in
right or left common femoral, superficial femoral, or popliteal
veins.

CXR ([**2147-7-10**]): Single AP chest radiograph compared to [**2147-7-9**] shows slight improvement in the perihilar edema. Bibasilar
atelectasis and small left pleural effusion persist. The
cardiomediastinal contour is stable. Right IJ central venous
catheter terminates within the proximal SVC. ET tube terminates
4.7 cm above the carina. NG tube courses bel
