Admission Date:  [**2177-10-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2177-10-17**]

Date of Birth:   [**2108-2-5**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69-year-old
man who has a known cardiomyopathy and has been followed by
Cardiology.  He recently complained of increasing dyspnea on
exertion and also increasing fatigue, especially since one
month prior to admission.  He also complained of occasional
discomfort in the abdomen and discomfort in the epigastric
area on exertion.  He also complained of palpitations and
heart rate in the 150s per report.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had cardiac
catheterizations, most recently in [**2170**], until just prior to
admission, and was at that time found to have normal coronary
arteries, elevated right and left heart pressures, with a
wedge of 15 and a cardiac index of 1.9.  Ejection fraction
was estimated at 39%.  His most recent echocardiogram in
[**2177-3-31**] showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of
35 to 40%, with [**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement and mild left
ventricular hypertrophy, with moderate aortic stenosis,
aortic insufficiency, with a peak gradient of 25 and a valve
area of 1.7 sq.cm., as well as mitral regurgitation and
tricuspid regurgitation.  The patient denied any symptoms of
claudication, edema or lightheadedness.  The patient was
admitted for further workup of his symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation
2.  Sleep apnea (uses CPAP)
3.  Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (drinks very rarely now)
4.  Congestive heart failure
5.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Surgery for left heel spur.

ALLERGIES:  Nitroglycerin (gives severe hypotension).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Cardizem 240 mg by mouth every morning
2.  Coumadin 7.5 mg on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday, and 5 mg
on other days
3.  Digoxin 0.25 mg Monday through Friday
4.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg once daily
5.  Aldactazide 25 mg tablet (one-half) once daily
6.  Proscar 5 mg by mouth once daily
7.  Coreg 3.125 mg (one-half tablet) once daily
8.  Lorazepam 0.5 mg by mouth as needed
9.  Ambien as needed

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99, heart rate 110 (atrial
fibrillation), blood pressure 139/76, oxygen saturation 93%
on room air.  Alert and oriented, in no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination within normal
limits.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:
Systolic ejection murmur, II/VI, irregular heart rhythm.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Trace
edema bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 47.4, white blood cell count
6.2, platelets 172.  INR 1.5.  Urinalysis negative.  Glucose
116, sodium 136, potassium 4.6, BUN 18, creatinine 1.0.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient first underwent cardiac
catheterization as an outpatient, given worsening symptoms.
There was no angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary
artery disease, but there was moderate aortic stenosis,
moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate systolic and
diastolic ventricular dysfunction.  Cardiac output was
severely reduced.  Left ventriculogram demonstrated moderate
mitral regurgitation.  Global left ventricular systolic
function was moderately reduced, with an ejection fraction of
approximately 37%, and mild global hypokinesis.

Given the findings of aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation,
and tricuspid regurgitation, the patient underwent on
[**2177-10-9**] aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm pericardial
valve and mitral valve replacement with a 29 mm porcine
mosaic valve.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and
there were no apparent complications.  Please see the full
operative report for details.

The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in good
condition.  He remained in atrial fibrillation, but his heart
rate was well controlled.  He maintained adequate blood
pressure and oxygen saturation.  His hematocrit
postoperatively was 37.6.  On postoperative day one, the
patient was extubated without difficulty.

His central line and Foley catheter were removed.
Postoperatively, the patient experienced a run of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (19 beats), as well as
an episode of hypoxia and low-grade fever.  A CT scan
angiogram was performed at the time, which was negative for a
pulmonary embolism.  A chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe
collapse and infiltrate.  The patient was started on
vancomycin and levofloxacin.  Blood cultures and sputum
cultures were negative.  The patient was continued on
Coumadin for his chronic atrial fibrillation.

Two days prior to discharge, the patient again had a run of
what appeared to be a nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Electrophysiology service was consulted and followed the
patient throughout his hospitalization course.  The
Electrophysiology service recommended increasing the
amiodarone dose to 400 mg three times a day and then placing
the patient on a low-maintenance dose.  His Lopressor dose
was lowered, as the patient became mildly symptomatic.

Physical Therapy followed the patient during his
hospitalization.  The patient still required supplemental
oxygen to receive appropriate oxygenation levels, especially
on ambulation.  It was thought that a rehabilitation center
with intensive pulmonary therapy would be most appropriate.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.
