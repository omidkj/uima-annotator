wound on foot and ankle.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 year old male with multiple medical problems
including ESRD on HD, CHF EF 15%, CAD s/p MI ([**2155**], [**2160**]), PVD
s/p multiple bypass grafts, DM2 with ESRD on HD recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**2164-10-16**] after being hospitalized for CHF
exacerbation who presented to the ED with shortness of breath.
Pt is well known to this service due to his multiple hospital
stays. The patient usually takes 80 mg PO lasix [**Hospital1 **] at home and
during his admission was given the same dose as his outpatient
regimen. He states that he has been taking his medications at
home. He states that he is compliant with his low-salt diet but
when asked further, states that he frequently eats fried chicken
and barbeque. The patient denies any chest pain, calf pain. The
patient believes that his shortness of breath symptoms are worse
usually on Sundays as he is dialyzed MWF.
.
The patient denies orthopnea and uses [**2-5**] pillows at home which
is his baseline. He denies any increased lower extremity edema.

.
In the ED, a CXR on [**2164-10-21**] was consistent with CHF with a
possible RLL pneumonia or opacity. He was also found to have an
ischemic left third toe and vascular surgery was consulted. He
had a lactate of 2.3 with a gap of 16 with a Cr of 5.7 (baseline
Cr [**5-8**], 6 during his last admission). His troponin was 0.15
which is his baseline troponin in the setting of his chronic
renal insufficiency. His CK was flat at 44. A pro-BNP was
checked and is pending.
.
In additon, he had a CT-A which was negative for PE with no
significant change from his prior admission with trace ascites.

.
His EKG showed sinus tachycardia with rate of 129, leftward
axis. LVH. QTc 459. [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in V5, V6 with TWI
(changed from baseline). TWI I, AVL (unchanged).
.
Pt also has ulceration of left foot.

Sinus rhythm. Poor R wave progression suggestive of anteroseptal
myocardial  infarction. Lateral ST-T wave abnormalities. Since
the previous tracing   of [**2164-11-15**] atrial flutter has resolved.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

[**2164-11-15**] 5:47 PM

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT

INDICATION: 63-year-old man with septic foot.

COMMENTS: Portable erect AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed,
and compared with the previous study of [**2164-11-11**].

The tip of the new left-sided PICC line is identified at
cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax is seen. The right jugular
IV catheter remains in place. There is continued cardiomegaly.
Patchy atelectasis is seen in the left lung base. The lungs are
clear otherwise.

IMPRESSION: The tip of the left-sided PICC line in the
cavoatrial junction. Continued cardiomegaly.

ART DUP EXT LO UNI;F/U

Reason: Evaluate L. ax fem grft patency and flow.

The left axillary-femoral bypass graft is patent. Peak systolic
velocities in the left axillary artery proximal to the graft are
70 cm/second, peak systolic velocity of the left proximal
anastomosis is 129 cm/sec, the peak systolic velocity in the
graft in the mid torso is 40 cm/sec, peak systolic velocities in
the graft at the distal anastomosis is 36 cm/sec, and the peak
systolic velocity in the proximal aspect of the left femoral
popliteal graft is 19 cm/sec. The left femoral popliteal graft
and remainder of the left lower extremity was not evaluated.

Two anechoic areas are found surrounding the axillofemoral graft
in the left groin and in the left upper torso. These anechoic
areas are well defined and demonstrates enhanced
through-transmission, consistent with seromas.

IMPRESSION:

1. The left axillary-femoral bypass graft is patent. There is a
change in velocities between the proximal anastomosis in the mid
graft, suggestive of a possible narrowing in the proximal aspect
