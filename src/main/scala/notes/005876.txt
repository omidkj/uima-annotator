Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catherization [**2207-3-12**]

History of Present Illness:
56 y/oM with PMH of CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG [**2197**], LIMA to LAD, SVG
to OM, Radial to PDA, mild chronic LV systolic heart failure
(LVEF 45%),
diabetes mellitus, CVA in [**2204**], and PAD who presented to [**Location (un) 620**]
ED with 4 hours midsternal chest pain and sob. His BNP was 7000.
He was given full dose ASA and nitro spray by EMS which improved
his chest pain, but not his SOB. At [**Location (un) 620**] where was given
lasix 60mg IV x1 (1400cc out), full dose ASA, sublingual nitro,
morphine and started on biPAP with improvement in shortness of
breath. EKG at [**Location (un) 620**] was nondiagnostic per report, but
troponin returned at 0.2 and he was given lovenox 90mg (0600)
for NSTEMI and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible PCI. EKG
nondiagnostic.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS: 80 148/80 28 95%. He was initially seen
to have resp distress, but was continued on Bipap 8/5, received
ativan 2mg, and started on a nitro gtt with improvement in SOB
and resolution of chest pain. Troponin returned at 0.18, BNP at
7200. CXR showed moderate alveolar pulmonary edema as well as
moderate cardiomegaly with ?small pleural effusions. On
transfer, vitals were HR 93, 146/81, 99 on 50%fio2 on [**9-6**] NIMV
mask. Access 18 gauge bilaterally.
.
On review of systems, he denies states he has gotten bleeding at
the site of his psoriasis when taking plavix, and so he stopped
it without notifying his cardiologist a few years ago.
Cardiologist is now aware. He denies any deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

      Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup
is
      performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep. are
reported if
      present. Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa
and
      S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..

      A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of
mycobacteria or
      filamentous fungi.  A negative result should be
interpreted with
      caution.  Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated
fluid should
      be submitted.

Cardiac Catheterization Report
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
demonstrated severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  The
LMCA was
angiographically-free of any flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD
had a long
segment of subtotal disease extending into the moderate D1
(unchanged).
Distal to the LMCA, the mid/distal LAD did appear to fill but it
was
diffusely and subtotally occluded.  The LCx was noted to have a
patent
stent in the large major OM2 with 50% disease proximal to the
stent, as
well as moderate disease distally.  The LCx also had an 80%
lesion
distally in the very small PDA. The occluded OM fills via graft
with
moderate disease. The RCA was known to be occluded and not
injected.
2. Selective conduit angiography of the radial-OM1 graft was
patent to
the OM1.  The SVG-RCA graft was known to be occluded and not
injected.
The LIMA-LAD was patent and not significantly changed from
previous
catherization in [**2205**].
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated
systemic
systolic arterial hypertension, with central aortic pressure of
148/85,
mean 111 mmHg.
4. Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease unchanged
since
coronary angiography in [**2205**].
2. Patent rad
