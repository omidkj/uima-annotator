Service:  MEDICINE/BLUMGARDT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old woman,
with no significant past medical history, who presented to an
outside hospital initially with acute onset of shortness of
breath and acute onset of high anxiety.  These symptoms came
on 2 hours prior to presentation while the patient was
sitting down and eating lunch.  She denied any pain.  She
denied any chest pain, fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting.
Her vital signs at the outside hospital showed her to be
afebrile with the heart rate in the 120s.  She was tachypneic
to 28 with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air.  A CT
scan was done which showed bilateral pulmonary emboli.  She
was transferred to this hospital for continued care.

On further history, the patient denies any periods of
immobilization or any leg swelling.  She is active and walks
up to 40 minutes a day.  She has had minimal weight loss in
the past.  She does admit to wrist fracture approximately 3
months ago, in [**2100-4-25**], and states that she also had back
surgery.  She is not on hormone replacement therapy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Hypercholesterolemia.
3. Left wrist fracture, [**2100-4-25**].
4. Back surgery, specifics unknown, in [**2100-4-25**].
5. Anxiety.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Zocor 10 mg qd.
2. Fosamax 70 mg q Sunday.
3. Hydrochlorothiazide, dose unknown.
4. Celexa 20 mg.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  She is close to
her family members.  She denies tobacco or alcohol use.  She
is active and walks daily.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs - she is
afebrile with a blood pressure of 110/69, heart rate 104,
respiratory rate 28.  She is satting 95% on 6 liters nasal
cannula.  This was increased to 100% on a nonrebreather.  She
is a well-appearing, elderly female, speaking in choppy
sentences.  She is alert and oriented x 3.  Her head is
normocephalic, atraumatic.  She has no scleral icterus.  Her
pupils are equal and reactive to light.  She has full
extraocular movements.  Her heart has a regular rhythm and is
tachy.  There are no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Her lungs are
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  She has fine left
basilar rales.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  No right upper quadrant
tenderness.  Her extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.  There are no palpable cords.  There are 2+ DP pulses.
Calves are symmetric.  Neuro exam - she is alert and
oriented.  There are no focal deficits.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 15.4, hematocrit
47.2, platelets 224.  Her chem-7 was within normal limits.
Her INR was 1.2.  Total protein 7.7, albumin 4.5, total
bilirubin 0.5.  LFTs were slightly elevated with an AST of
112, ALT 98, alk phos 121.  A first set of cardiac enzymes
showed a troponin of 0.6 and a CPK of 88.  Two ABGs were
drawn at the outside hospital.  The first one had a pH of
7.44, carbon dioxide 34, oxygen 45.  Five hours later, a
second one was drawn which showed a pH of 7.46, carbon
dioxide 33, oxygen 39.

RADIOGRAPHIC DATA:  A CTA was performed which showed a left
main pulmonary artery embolus, as well as a right segmental
artery embolus.  A chest x-ray showed left lower lobe
atelectasis.  EKG at the outside hospital showed sinus tach
with typical S1, Q3, T3.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) BILATERAL PULMONARY EMBOLI:  The patient
was initially admitted to the MICU overnight for close
observation of her oxygen status.  She was started on a
heparin drip.  Her PTTs were monitored, and the drip was
titrated.  She did well overnight.  Her oxygen requirement
changed from a nonrebreather mask to nasal cannula, satting
approximately 94% on 3 liters.  She was called out of the
MICU the following day and transferred to the floor.  There,
the heparin drip was continued and Coumadin was started.

An ultrasound was performed which showed left-sided DVTs, one
in the deep femoral vein, and another in the superficial
femoral vein.  An echo was also performed which showed an
ejection fraction of greater than 55%.  However, it did show
a dilated right ventricle with moderate global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis.  There was mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

The etiology of Ms. [**Known lastname 46272**] pulmonary emboli and DVTs are
deferred for work-up as an outpatient.  Her hospitalization
was discussed with her primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 51132**], of
[**Hospital 1263**] Hospital who will be following her.  Malignancy is a
great concern, considering the unexpected presentation of
pulmonary embolus and no other risk factors per patient.  She
has not had colonoscopy.  She has had mammography as recently
as a year ago which she reports was negative.  It is unlikely
that a hypocoagulability state would present for the first
time this late in life.  However, she also needs to have
further work-up for this.  Her distant history of a right
wrist fracture with rehabilitation 3 months ago is a mild
risk factor, but not convincing in these circumstances.

2) CARDIOLOGY:  On admission, the patient had an elevated
troponin of 0.37.  This subsequently fell in the 3 following
sets.  It was felt that this was a troponin leak secondary to
right heart strain and some myocardial injury.  This was
confirmed with an echo.

3) EARLY DEMENTIA/MUSICAL HALLUCINATION:  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
patient has a history of musical hallucinations which were
treated with Celexa.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 51132**], her primary care doctor,
also states that she has early signs of dementia, but has not
yet acknowledged her situation.  The musical hallucinations
were discussed with the patient.  She said that they were a
symptom of the past but not currently, but was amenable to
continuing Celexa while in-house.  The diagnosis of early
dementia was not discussed with the patient, and no signs of
it were evident on exam here.

DISCHARGE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] will be discharged in fair condition.
She will be going to the [**Hospital6 **]
[**Hospital **] Hospital.  She continues to have an oxygen
requirement, satting 92-94% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  She
will be discharged with Lovenox shots [**Hospital1 **].  She will continue
taking Coumadin 5 mg at night.  The goal INR is between
2.5-3.5.  Once this INR is reached, Lovenox and Coumadin will
be overlapped for the following 48 hours, at which point
Lovenox will be discontinued.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] will have follow-up
with her primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 51132**], to continue her
dosage of Coumadin, and to track her INR.  He will also
follow her for the work-up of her hypocoagulability state.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli.
2. Deep vein thrombosis x 2.
3. Right ventricular strain with myocardial injury.
4. Status post left wrist fracture.
5. Anxiety.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
