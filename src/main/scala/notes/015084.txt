Reports:
CT Head:  IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
.
Admission CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
2. Pulmonary edema. Additional basilar opacities may be due to a
combination of dependent edema and atelectasis, but aspiration
should also be considered.
.
ECHO EF >60%
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation (however, views are
suboptimal). The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
No mitral regurgitation is seen (however, views are suboptimal).
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Renal U/S:
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable renal ultrasound
.
Chest Xray [**4-28**]:  IMPRESSION: Chest clear, no overt failure.


Brief Hospital Course:
f#Altered Mental Status:
The differential diagnosis for this was broad including
medications, infection.  Pt was intubated and admitted to MICU
and treated for pneumonia as below. Her mental status improved
and after extubation was at baseline with no further
unresponsiveness or evidence of seizure.  Head imaging did not
show any acute process.  Lumbar puncture unremarkable.
.
#Aspiration pneumonia:
Pt had copious secretions via ETT.  She was started on and
complete a 10d course of broad spectrum antibiotics for
pneumonia.  Once extubated, her respiratory status improved
steadily.
.
#Diastolic CHF:
Pt diuresed with lasix with improvement.  She was able to come
off of oxygen.  Repeat CXR demonstrated clearance of CHF and
effusions.  She was then maintained on a steady dose of PO lasix
and antihypertensives.  Intially on BB, hydralazine and imdur,
but given diastolic dysfunction, lopressor titrated to 62.5 mg
[**Hospital1 **] on discharge.  This should be titrated prn to goal HR ~ 60
given diastolic dysfunction.
.
#Acute Renal Failure: was likely from ATN. This improved with
diuresis.  Pt was then overdiuresed and Cr climbed again to 2.0.
 Lasix was held and then decreased and Cr settled in mid 1s
which is her baseline.  Lasix dose at discharge was 40 mg daily.
Would avoid ACE-I for now as she has had problems with
hyperkalemia (see below).
.
#Hyperkalemia:  Likely multifactorial.  Seen by renal.  Felt to
be hypoaldo state.  Improved with lasix, florinef and low K
diet.  Given concurrent dCHF, florinef held at discharge, but
she should have her K levels monitored as an outpatient.  She
should become hyperkalemic again, Florinef (.1 mg) should be
restarted.
.
#Sinusitis:  Completed course of augmenin.
.
#Psych:  Another large componenet of this hospitalization.  Pt
had been on ativan as outpt for anxiety.  She was also on celexa
which was continued.  Started on wellbutrin and in process of
tapering off ativan slowly.  She is also on methadone
maintenance.  Dose was reduced to 60mg and pt is interested in
coming off methadone.
Current dose of Ativan is now .5 mg qhs.  This may be decreased
to .25 mg qhs for a few days and subsequently stopped.  No signs
of benzo w/d in house.

Of note, Pt had a PPD placed which was negative.
