65 F c COPD, HTN p/w malaise, diaphoresis, SOB for 1 week.  Also

98.5, HR 87, BP 172/101, RR 24, sat 94% on 2L NC.  Noted to be
in resp. distress, unable to speak in full sentences.
Significant wheezing. ABG showed pCO2 60, p02 71; placed on
BiPAP.  CXR clear by radiology report.  Treated with nebulizers,
solumedrol, levofloxacin.  Also treated for hypertensive urgency
(BP to 200/100 in ED after presentation) with lisinopril and
amlodipine.
.
At baseline, pt has home O2 2.5L NC for daily use & BiPAP at
night. Pt has never been intubated.  Pt reports not using her
supplemental 02 during the day, though she says she always uses
her BiPAP for sleep.  Has not been using Nebs recently.  No
known sick contacts.

CXR: Study is mildly compromised secondary to body habitus. No
superimposed consolidations or effusions are noted. There is
minimal ectasia of the thoracic aorta with atherosclerotic
disease. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged but stable. No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 F w/long history of COPD, OSA, and HTN admitted to MICU on
[**2199-3-8**] with COPD exacerbation. The following issues were
investigated during this hospitalization:
.
#. COPD exacerbation:  Pt's respiratory distress was likely from
COPD exacerbation triggered by a  viral URI. Additionaly,
patient reported non-compliance w/ daytime supplemental 02 which
likely contributed to her presentation. She was treated with an
initial dose of IV solumedrol on admission, then transitioned to
a PO steroids taper. She also received nebs which were
transitioned to an MDI. She continued on BiPAP at night and 02
by NC during the day and was improving, however, it was noted
that her bicarbonate was slowly trending up. An ABG on room air
showed values of 7.37/68/46. This was compared to an ABG in the
MICU with a CO2 of 68. Given the hypoxia, a repeat ABG on 3 L NC
showed values of 7.34/86/86. The pulmonary consult team was
curbsided and advised placing the patient on BiPAP during the
day for a few hours each day in order to allow the patient to
ventilate her CO2. She remained awake and alert with good
mentation despite the readings of the ABG. Additionally, it was
confirmed with the respiratory team that knows the patient, that
the patient's CO2 baseline is close to that reflected in the
initial ABG. She was discharged to pulmonary rehabilitation on 1
L of O2 with a satisfactory O2 saturation of 92%.
.
#. HTN: Patient was found to have several episodes of
hypertensive urgency for which she received one time doses of
Amlodipine and Lisinopril. Both of these medications, which the
patient had been taking as an outpatient, were increased to
maximum values of 10 and 40 mg respectively. A beta blocker was
not an ideal 3rd option given the patient's COPD and while HCTZ
would have been an ideal choice, a sulfa drug allergy prevented
her from safely receiving it. Since increasing Lisinopril, the
patient's BP has been better controlled with a sytolic BP range
between 150s - 160s.
.
#. SCHIZOPHRENIA/DEPRESION: Stable during this hospitalization.
Pt. is  followed at Mass Mental as an outpatient. She was
continued on her outpatient regimen of Risperdal, Trazodone and
Prozac.
.
#. GERD: Pt. was maintained on her outpatient PPI.
.
#. HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Pt. was maintained on her outpatient statin.
.
#. OSA: Pt. with known pulmonary artery hypertension and large
body habitus, on BiPAP ([**10-18**] w/ 3L 02) at home, which was
maintained during this hospitalization.
.
# Conjunctivitis L eye: Noted while in MICU, but resolved with
Erythromycin OPH TID.
