Radiology
CT abdomen [**8-14**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Mild stranding and fluid around the left common femoral
graft origin.  No
enhancing lesions to suggest abscess.
2.  New left lower lobe and right middle lobe pulmonary nodules
measuring up
to 11 mm are concerning for infection, a full chest CT is
recommended to
evaluate the extent of this process.
3.  Widely patent bifemoral grafts.
4.  Cholelithiasis.
5.  Nodular contour of the liver suggestive of cirrhosis.
6.  Splenomegaly and parasplenic varices indicative of chronic
portal
hypertension.

Cardiology: Echo [**8-14**]
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric LVH. Septal hypokinesis. There is
a calcified mass on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve,
this was present on prior study. It could be consistent with a
healed vegetation or calcification from another cause.

Neurology: EEG [**8-14**]
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the occasional slowing of the
background and
bursts of generalized slowing. These findings suggest a
widespread
encephalopathy. Metabolic distort disorders are most common
causes.
Nevertheless, the background was very difficult to discern or
characterize.
Also, there were no areas of prominent focal slowing. There were
no
definitely epileptiform abnormalities.

 STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
         Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood
cultures
         positive for Staphylococcus aureus, yeast or other
fungi.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] is a 58 year old male with multiple medical problems
including ESRD on HD (T/th/Sat), HepC, severe PVD s/p multiple
interventions, HTN, DM2 who presented on [**8-13**] with left wrist
cellulitis and weakness/malaise after missing HD for one week.
He was admitted to the general medicine floor on antibiotics and
was brought to HD urgently in the AM, though he developed acute
agitation, and atrial fibrillation with RVR in the 140s. He was
transferred to the MICU for HD. His heart rate was controlled
with diltiazem gtt which has since been transitioned to PO dilt
with good control to the 100-110's. He was intubated for airway
protection and possible OR debridement of a worsening left foot
infection from a recent transmetatarsal amputation. His
antibiotics were expanded to vancomycin/cefepime. His blood
cultures later returned positive for MSSA and so he was
transitioned to cefazolin, the likely source of his left wrist
septic joint as aspiration of the joint fluid by hand surgery
revealed MSSA as well. A TTE showed valvular calcification and
wall motion abnormalities (attributed to sepsis/uremia) but no
vegetations were found to explain the bacteremia. He [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a
