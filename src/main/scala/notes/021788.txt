History of Present Illness:
66F h/o dCHF (EF >60% in [**2170**]), COPD/asmath, DMII, gout, morbid
obesity who presents to [**Hospital 882**] hospital today with 1 week of
abdominal discomfort over pannus and worsening SOB. She states
that she had a URI in the end of the [**Month (only) **] which caused her to
have significant SOB for which she was tx with antibiotic and 4
day course of steroids. She startd to feel better after 1 week
and then again last weekend developed worsening SBO. She uses O2
at 3-5L Nc at home and her sats have been in the mid to upper
80s which is slightly worse than her baseline for low 90s to
upper 80s%. She had decresed her dose of Torsimide from 60mg to
30 mg since this was causing her "to urinate all the time". She
was having difficulty showering and walking to the bathroom
given her SOB and DOE. Her chest felt tight as when she has
asthma, but she did not have any chest pain. She has been
coughing, occ greenish sputum, but denies any fever or chills.
No recent sick contacts. She also noted to have gained a total
of 20lbs this week. She states that she has been monitoring her
salt intake although her PCP notes dietary [**Name9 (PRE) 92486**] with
increase amounts of pistachio. She has also drinking "more
water" since she did not feel well.

In regards her abd pain, she was having pain over her pannus
over the last few days. She also feels that her abd girth has
increased and that her area in her abd is now erythematous. She
does not inject her insulin in her abd and had no trauma. She
had prior infection on her abd a long time ago and she was
previously treated with antibiotics.

Today, she was having worse pain on her pannus and felt
extremely SOB, her home O2 sat was in the 60% on [**3-23**] L NC and
she felt swollen. So, she went to [**Hospital 882**] hospital. At [**Hospital1 882**]
ED her vitals were 98.4, 90, 28, 118/73, 28, 74% on RA, and 91%
on face mask. Her ABG 7.40/62/59/37. She was given Torsimide
60mg PO, Dual nebs and had a foley placed. She had 750 mLs of
UOP, as per report her Cxray she appeared to be fluid
overloaded. She was then transferred here for further
management. She usually goes to B&W, but ended up coming here
due to her insurance and [**Hospital1 **].

On the arrival to the ED her vitals were 97.9 97 109/90 24 99%
15L Non-Rebreather. she was transiently somnolent and hypoxemic
when been transported by EMS, so she was changed to NRM. Her PE
was notable for diffuse inspiratory crackles, rales, and
wheezing, bilateral LE edema, erythema and tenderness on her bil
LE quads. She became more alert and changed to NC 6L with sats
in the low 90s%. Cxray consistent with cardiomegaly and pulm
edema. EKG is now NSR with PVCs. Her BNP was noted to be only 5.
Her UO by 23:00 was 1.3L she was then given additional 60mg of
IV lasix. She had CT of her abd that showed panniculitis and ?
inflammed pancreatic head. She was then given vancomycin 1 gm
for the panniculitis. She was then admitted to the ICU for
hypoxia.

On arrival to the ICU, pt appears comfortable sitting up in bed.
Her O2 sat was in the low 90s% on 6 L then drops to low to mid
80%s. She was then placed on NRB with sats in the low to mid
90%s.

ROS; As per HPI. Neg for fever, chills. Increase in wt (20 lbs
in 1 wk). Increase in SOB, DOE, + orthopnea, chest tightness, no
cp. LE edema (ankles) incrase in abd girth. No changes in BM
pattern. Urinary freq, occ burning. Pain on her knees bil due to
osteoarthritis, but unchanged from her baseline.

Imaging:
CXR:
Widened mediastinum, enlarged pulmonary arteries and moderate
cardiomegaly are unchanged. Improved left lower lobe opacities
are consistent with improving atelectasis and pleural effusion.
Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved.  Mild pulmonary edema
is grossly unchanged.

Ultrasound:
IMPRESSION: No deep vein thrombosis seen in either leg.

Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion suggestive of
pericardial constriction. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Poor technical quality study due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular function appears low normal, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Moderate right
ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction. At least
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Abnormal septal
motion suggestive of pericardial constriction.

CT abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION: Limited study demonstrates inflammation of the panus
suggestive of panniculitis. Additionally, there is very mild
stranding surrounding the pancreatic head which may be
suggestive of early pancreatitis at the head
