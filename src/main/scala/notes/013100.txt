Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6378**]
Chief Complaint:
Right shoulder pain with associated fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
55 year-old gentleman with h/o cervical spondylosis who presents
with fevers and right shoulder pain. First noticed right
shoulder pain and swelling Monday afternoon. He felt it was
likely [**1-28**] "irritating it" while sailing on Sunday although no
specific injury. No other recent trauma. Fevers began shortly
thereafter and have been intermittent up to 103 at home. No
chills. No cough, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea or
dysuria. Went to PCP who sent patient to ED with concern for
infected shoulder.
.
On arrival in ED initial VS were 98.3 hr 100 bp 138/73 rr 16 sat
97%/ra. Patient was unable to lift his right arm due to pain.
Evaluated by orthopedics, attempted to tap shoulder twice but
unable to collect fluid. While in ED O2 sats dropped to 88%/ra.
CXR showed bilateral consolidations. CBC showed WBC of 10.9 with
32% bands. Lactate 2.0.
.
Upon further review patient now feels that he has been slightly
more short of breath across the past 4-5 days although at the
time he thought this was just due to his being in poorer shape
than previously.
.
No rashes. No known recent infectious exposures. No prior
history of septic arthritis.

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**8-28**]: The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Estimated
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Chest X-Ray [**8-29**]: Multifocal opacities have been significantly
increased in the interim involving the entire lungs and
demonstrating progression of the infection or potentially
combination of infection and ARDS. Hemorrhage would be another
possibility. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 30171**] [**8-31**]: 1. Findings in keeping with fasciitis and
myositis, however, nonspecific in appearance.
2. Acromioclavicular joint changes,likely severe DJD, however
with the above
findings, infection cannot be excluded.
3. Glenoid labral tears, as above.
4. Small partial undersurface tear of the distal supraspinatus
tendon.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 30171**] [**9-6**]: 1. No significant change in appearance of
nonspecific myositis about the right shoulder.
2. Bone marrow edema and enhancement in the acromion and distal
clavicle is
little changed in distribution over short interval.
Osteomyelitis cannot be
excluded.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a 55 male with a hx of cervial spondylosis who
presented with fevers and right shoulder pain concerning for
septic arthritis. He was noted to have desatruations to the mid
80's on the floor.
.
# Respiratory Distress: While in ED O2 sats dropped to 88%/ra.
CXR showed bilateral consolidations. CBC showed WBC of 10.9 with
32% bands. Lactate 2.0. The patient was admitted to the medicine
service and treated with Vanc/ctx/azithro. Over the next 24
hours, the patient has continued to be febrile, and
intermittently required a nonrebreather to maintain O2
saturation in the 90s. A blood gas drawn the morning of [**8-28**] on
NRB showed: 7.43/35/65/24. He was felt to possibly have a
component of CHF from 4 L fluid resuscitation overnight, and
given furosemide 10 IV, then 20 IV with 2L fluid output over the
course of the day.  The next morening, the patient was febrile
to 103.9; he was sent for CXR on 6L nc and became hypoxic to
75%; he was replaced on NRB and SaO2 improved to 99%. CXR showed
worsening of bilateral consolidations concerning for multifocal
infection versus ARDS and he was transferred to the MICU for
closer monitoring.  In the MICU he was initially on a NRB, he
has [**3-30**] blood culture bottles from [**8-27**] growing GPCs that were
speciated to MSSA.  His antibiotics were narrowed to nafcillin.
He had a TTE that did not show endocarditis.  Over the course of
24 hours his respiratory status improved and he was down to 5LNC
and his CXR showed improving infiltrates.
.
#Shoulder Pain: Patient with MSSA growing in blood, likely MSSA
pneumonia and shoulder pain concerning for infected joint.
Ortho was unable to get fluid on the Glenohumoral joint, and the
patient's ROM and pain were more consistent with a AC joint
infection.  Patient was taken to IR for guided taps which did
not reveal organisms. All surveillance cultures were negative
and the patient was narrowed to Nafcillin and followed by the
infectious disease service. However, MRI on [**8-31**] of shoulder
revealed edema in soft tissues and along fascial planes of
muscle concerning for potential abscess or possibly necrotising
fasciitis. He subsequently developed a rash on nafcillin and he
was placed back on Vancomycin. Infectious disease recommended a
total of 6 weeks for treatment with an end date of [**10-11**].
.
Transaminititis: He was noted to have rising LFTs during his
admission. At first it was thought that it was secondary to
sepsis and shock liver however they continued to trend upward.
He subsequenlty developed a rash and the nafcillin was sitched
to Vancomycin. After he was switched to Vancomycin his LFTs
began to trend downward to the normal range.
