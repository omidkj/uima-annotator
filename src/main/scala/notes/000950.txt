Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Percocet / Vicodin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, exertional dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2200-10-27**] Mitral Valve Replacement (33mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue)/
Coronary artery bypass grafts x 4 (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-Dg,
SVG-PDA)
[**2200-10-24**] Left and right heart catheterization, coronary
angiography


History of Present Illness:
80M with history of coaornary disease who was in usual health
until two weeks ago when he noted progressively worsening
dyspnea and orthopnea. His symptoms progressively worsened and
he presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**10-23**] and was found to be in
heart failre  with a BNP of 2351 and a borderline troponin of
0.15. An ECHO was performed and showed LVEF of 25%. He was
diuresed with IV lasix and was oxygenating well on 2L NC but
still had dyspnea. Of note, the patient's last stress test was
in [**2199**] and was unremarkable with preserved  LVEF. He received
metformin and lovenox on morning of transfer and was not given
plavix. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization.

At cath, he was found to have severe three vessel coronary
artery disease, moderate to severely elevated right and left
sided filling pressures and  depressed cardiac index and
ejection fraction with diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle.

He was referred for surgical revascularization.


Past Medical History:
osteoporosis
spinal stenosis
hx of asbestos exposure
kidney stones- s/p lithotripsy colon polyps
hyperlipidemia
glaucoma
peripheral  vascular disease.
diverticulosis
colonic polyps
Hypertension
diabetes


Social History:
Quit smoking 44 years ago, previously had a 15 pack-year
history. There is no history of alcohol abuse.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death. Father died of CVA. No other known FH of CVD.


Pertinent Results:
[**2200-10-24**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
severe, calcific three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA
did not have focal stenoses. The LAD had a 90% stenosis in the
mid-vessel. The proximal portion of the major diagonal branch
had a 70% stenosis. The LCx had a 99% stenosis at the origin,
with left to left collaterals. The RCA was totally occluded
proximally, with left to right collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed moderate to severely elevated
right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 19 mm Hg, LVEDP 25
mm Hg, respectively). The PCWP mean was elevated at 28 mm Hg.
There was moderate pulmonary artery hypertension (PASP 59 mm
Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was low-normal (SBP
105 mm Hg). The cardiac index was depressed at 1.7 L/min/m2. The
systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were mildly elevated
at 1697 dynes-sec/cm5 and 315 dynes-sec/cm5, respectively.
3. Left ventriculography demonstrated a dilated left ventricle
with global, severe hypokinesis to akinesis, with estimated
ejection fraction of 25%. There was moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation.
[**2200-10-25**] ECHO:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral and inferoseptal akinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30
%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. An eccentric, medially directed jet of at
least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **]  was found to have triple vessel disease on
catheterization, with right heart pressure elevated and mitral
regurgitation.  He was taken to the operating room on [**10-27**] where
coronary bypass grafting and mitral valve replacement were
performed.  See operative note for details.  He weaned from
bypass on Milrinone,epinephrine and neosynephrine.

Postoperatively he was relatively stable and was extubated on
[**Name (NI) 80108**]. His epinephrine was weaned and discontinued as was his
neosynephrine by POD 2.  The Milrinone was then slowly weaned
and he remained stable.

He was gently diuresed, however, he became hypotensive each time
he received a Lasix bolus.  A Lasix drip was instituted with a
good diuresis and stable blood pressure.  Consult was obtained
from the CHF service-- we appreciate their recommendations.  The
patient was transitioned from the lasix gtt to bolus treatment,
which he tolerated well.

He made good progress with physical therapy before discharge.
By the time of discharge, the patient was ambulating with
assistance, the pain was controlled with oral analgesics, and
the woundf was healing.  He was discharged on POD 15 to The
Rehab of [**Location (un) **] and Islands for further recovery.
