Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2520**] is an 81 year-old female with past medical history
significant for respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy and
decannulation who presents from home with decreased level of
consciousness. Per daughter, the patient had been doing well all
week. She saw her PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**] and was given a clean [**Doctor First Name **] of
health. On Thursday evening the patient continued to have
problems for sleep so her PCP recommended that her dose of
Ambien being increased from 5mg to 10mg. The patient took her
2nd dose of Ambien at 11pm and within 1 hour she became quite
sleepy and more difficult to arouse and also tachypneic. Her
daughter called 911 and the patient was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Per
daughter, her mother did not have any difficulty breathing. No
recent fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, dizziness, or dysuria.
Patient has been compliant with all her medications.
.
In the ED her initial vitals were T 97.3 BP 145/47 AR 103 RR 26
O2 sat 98% on 4L NC. She was reactive to tactive stimuli and
sternal rub. Patient appeared to become more agitated and her O2
sats continued to drop. She was placed on face mask at this time
with improvement in O2 sats to 98-100%. Patient was taken to CT
scan but was found to be in increased distress and was found to
be "blue". Given prior tracheostomy, underwent fiberoptic
tracheostomy. Given chest xray findings she received Lasix 120mg
IV and Cipro 400mg IV. She then went to CT scan and then
transferred to MICU for closer monitoring.
.

Past Medical History:
.
- Respiratory failure: Admitted to BIMDC in [**1-14**] after cardiac
arrest, presumed to be secondary respiratory failure. She had a
tracheostomy at that time. She was decannulated on [**2167-6-19**] and
tolerated the procedure well.
- Hypertension
- Type 2 Diabetes
- Lymphoma, s/p chemotherapy several years ago and s/p XRT [**11-12**]
(unclear where radiation was targeted to) - followed at [**Hospital1 2025**]
- Glaucoma
- Cataracts, baseline anisocoria (R pupil)
.

Social History:
Lives at home with her daughter, at baseline very active. No
tobacoo/EtOH/illicits. Receives medical care primarily from B&W
and [**Hospital1 2025**].

STUDIES:
[**8-7**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**8-7**] CTA chest:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Limited evaluation of the lung parenchyma with bibasilar
atelectasis. Subtle ground-glass change may represent acute
infection or subtle edema, though this is more likely to be due
to patient respiratory motion.
3. Narrowing of trachea near carina may represent a component of
tracheobronchomalacia, though this is unclear.

[**8-7**] EKG: normal sinus rhythm at 81bpm.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 2520**] is an 81 year-old female with PMH significant for DM,
HTN, 2 prior admissions this year for respiratory failure, s/p
tracheostomy in [**6-13**], who presented with hypercarbic respiratory
failure in the setting of sedative overdose. She was initially
intubated in the MICU but was extubated in less than a day.
.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory failure: The patient was admitted with
hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of overdose of
Ambien requiring brief intubation. The etiology of her
hypercarbia was unclear but felt likely due to underlying
obesity hypoventilation syndrone and obstructive sleep apnea.
This was supported by the fact that she had elevated bicarbonate
suggesting she is a chronic CO2 retainer. ABG on RA [**2167-8-11**] was
also consistent with chronic CO2 retention. Her hypercarbia
resolved when on bipap overnight, however she was not always
able to use the mask secondary to her anxiety. She was evaluated
by pulmonary who felt that the etiology of her hypercarbia was
likely multifactorial as above. She had a CTA of the chest which
was negative for PE but did reveal some atelectasis and
interstitial edema. It was recommended that she have PFTs and a
sleep study, however the patient refused both of these studies.
She also refused TTE to evaluate her cardiac function given her
fluid overload on exam. Overnight pulse oximetry study was
attempted but had to be discontinued secondary to anxiety,
though it did note that she desaturated to the mid-80s on rooma
air. She was discharged with home O2 and bipap.
.
# Anxiety: Throughout her hospitalization, the patient
demonstrated significant anxiety regarding her medical condition
and being in the hospital. She responded well to frequent
reassurance. She was given trazodone for sleeping. Ambien and
other sedatives were avoided. She was evaluated by psychiatry in
house. They did not have any further specific recommendations at
this time. Outpatient follow-up was recommended but the patient
was not interested at the time.
.
# Hypertension: She takes Diltiazem and Metoprolol at home. Both
were held while in MICU. Lopressor was re-started on the floor.
She was re-started on her home dose of diltiazem on discharge,
as she had been normotensive on the floor with only the beta
blocker.
.
# Insulin-dependent Type II DM: She takes Humulin at home (40
qAM, 28 pre-dinner). She was treated with NPH here as well as a
humalog sliding scale. On discharge she was to re-start her home
insulin regimen. It was recommended that she discuss with her
PCP starting [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 71114**] ACEI, baby aspirin, and a statin as an
outpatient, as these have all been shown to decrease
cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes.
.
# Positive UA: Urinalysis on admission showed moderate
leukocytes & bacteria. She also had a peripheral leukocytosis
with WBC of 12.3. She denied urinary symptoms. She was started
on Cipro in the ED, however given history of cipro allergy, was
changed to Macrobid. Urine culture was unremarkable (~[**2159**]/mL
gram positive bacteria and ~1000/mL probable enterococcus) so
macrobid was discontinued.
