CONTINUATION OF INTERVAL DISCHARGE SUMMARY DICTATED BY
DR.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ON [**2103-8-20**].

Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit on
[**2103-8-21**].  At that time, he was tachypneic and
showed a pH of 7.41, O2 180, CO2 51. The patient required
frequent suctioning.

RESPIRATORY:  Lungs were very coarse.  The patient had a
chest x-ray with some fluid overloading.  For the overloads
the patient was given Lasix.  However, with the increasing
shortness of breath and respiratory difficulty, he was again
increasing respiratory distress.  He was given a total of
20  mg times one and then given BiPAP and then switched to
face mask O2.  Chest and respiratory:  PT was continued.
Over the next few days, using inhalers, inhaled Albuterol and
Atrovent, continued antibiotics, the respiratory problems
decreased.  We started Combivent q.4h. and also Serevent MDI,
which also helped with the shortness of breath.

On [**8-25**], he required a blood transfusion as the
hematocrit dropped to 26.  He tolerated this blood
transfusion well.  He was on 35% face mask.  It is believed
that the respiratory problems were most likely due to chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.

He was transferred to the Neurology Service later that day on
[**8-25**].  At that time the vital signs were stable.
Blood pressure was 106/58.  Pulse 72.  Temperature 99.0.
Oxygen saturation was 99% on face mask 35%.  Neurological
examination remained unchanged, except he was starting to
make some sounds with his tongue, but not following commands.
We called the GI Department to set the patient up for a GI
tube for feeding.  We continued the Vancomycin and Levaquin.
We treated the urinary tract infection and pneumonia.  We
continued providing oxygen as needed on the following day.
The oxygen saturations on room air were greater than 98%, so
we discontinued the oxygen.

On [**8-27**], the patient continued to improve.  Again,
the vital signs were stable.  He had the PEG placed the
following day by the GI Department and tolerated the
procedure well.  The day after that we started tube feeds,
which he again tolerated well.

He continued to make good progress until [**8-29**], when
he spiked another fever.  At that point, we pulled the
central line.  Since that point, he continued to improve
clinically.  The white count continued to come down from 23,
then to 17.5 on the 4th, and then on the day prior to
discharge the white count was normal.  The coagulations, on
the day prior to discharge, were PT of 14.5, and PTT of 45.2.
The hematocrit was 28.7, hemoglobin was 9.7.  We rechecked
one more hematocrit later in the day.

PLAN:  The plan was to discharge Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] on Saturday
morning, [**9-1**] to the [**Hospital3 102589**] Home.  This is
contingent whether the hematocrit is stable and he is
afebrile.  We will continued Levaquin and Flagyl while he is
at rehabilitation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to the nursing
home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Left middle cerebral artery stroke;
right hemiparesis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levaquin 500 mg per G tube q.d.
2.  Metronidazole 500 mg per G tube q.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg per G q.d.
4.  Levothyroxine sodium 50 mcg per G tube q.d.
5.  The patient is also on tube feeding promote with fiber
full strength.  Goal rate of 55 ml an hour with additional IV
fluids of 20 ml an hour.
6.  Albuterol sulfate/ipratropium 2 puffs q.4h.
7.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously q.12h.
8.  Beclomethasone oral two puffs t.i.d.
9.  Plavix 75 mg per G tube q.d.

The patient should also have pneumatic boots.













The patient should follow up with the [**Hospital 878**] Clinic after
discharge from rehabilitation.  The patient is to consult
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 102590**] with questions and follow up needs in the
neurology clinic.  Phone #:  [**Pager number **]-667-.....................
