History of Present Illness:
52M with a history of diabetes, kidney transplant in [**2162**] and
[**10/2182**], pancreas
transplant in [**2167**], colon cancer, and tracheobronchomalacia
status post Y stent placement [**2183-11-27**] removed [**2184-2-25**] for
excessive granulation tissue with a subsequent hospital stay
through [**2184-3-1**] for respiratory failure and discharged on Bipap
and home oxygen.

Since hospital discharge [**2184-3-1**], he [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] a repeat flexible
bronchoscopy showing considerable regression of bilateral
mainstem granulation tissue.  He endorses improvement in cough
and breathing, although continues with occasional paroxysms that
seem to be abated some with supplemental oxygen.  He was taken
off oxygen for 20 min in [**Hospital 3390**] clinic with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] lap around the office
and tells me his oxygen did not dip below 94% on room air.
Dyspnea occurs after ambulation of a block.  He also continues
to use Bipap at night that he finds gives him refreshing sleep.

This has had severe impact on his quality of life and as he had
had a excellent response to stent placement with notable
improvement in his dyspnea and a difference in his cough it was
felt he would benefit from tracheoplasty.
