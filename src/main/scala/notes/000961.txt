Allergies:
Clozapine / Propranolol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**]
Chief Complaint:
sent from rehab for hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
86 y/o F w/severe dementia, recent femur fx [**1-31**], who earlier on
[**2196-4-1**] was reportedly witnessed aspirating jello. She was then
noted to be febrile to 103, tachycardic in the 120s. She was
begun on ceftriaxone and flagyl for presumed aspiration
pneumonia, and a PICC line was placed. She was hydrated with NS
at 125 cc/hr. Over the course of the day, she became more
hypotensive to 90/46 and then to 80/40 (after having been 156/60
earlier in the day). Her o2 saturation was 88% on 3L NC. Of
note, in a progress note from the day prior ([**2196-3-31**]), it states
she had been having diarrhea and loose stools which was
concerning to her caretakers at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab given their
[**Name (NI) **] outbreak.
.
In our ED, her vitals were 100.6, 84/42, 100, 28, and 88% on 6L
NC (improved to 98% on a NRB). She was begun on levophed, and
her pressure dropped as low as 69/31. She was given vancomycin
and zosyn. After discussion with her legal guardian, it was
decided she would not want any invasive lines but would want
pressors and antibiotics. She was admitted to the MICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 year-old female with dementia and femur fracture who
presented with hypotension, fever, tachycardia, likely urosepsis
vs aspiration pneumonia.
.
# Septic shock: Urine appears grossly infected although UA not
remarkable. Obviously given witnessed aspiration, pneumonia is
also a likely contributor. GNR bactaremia per [**Hospital 100**] rehab [**4-27**]
bottles. Has had vomiting and diarrhea, most likely [**Location (un) 27292**]
given where she came from, but could also have C. Diff. [**Month (only) 116**]
potentially become hypovolemic, became more confused, then
aspirated. Another source of infection is her decubitis ulcer
although it appears intact. Currently appears severely volume
depleted by exam, labs, and poor urine output. Responded to IV
fluid hydration and was successfully weaned off of pressors.
Initially started on meropenem for broad-spectrum antibiotic
coverage but narrowed to ciprofloxacin prior to discharge, to
complete a 2 week course on [**2196-4-15**].  [**Month (only) 116**] need to adjust
antibiotics based on further sensitivities.
.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine was 2.0 on admission. Most
likely pre-renal azotemia from volume depletion as creatinine
normalied with IV fluids.  Urine negative for eosinophils.
.
# Hypoxia: Was hypoxic to 88% on 6L NC. Most likely due to
aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis given hx. Currently saturating
well on a face tent.  Wean O2 as tolerated.
.
# Elevated troponin: Unclear the significance of this. No ECG
changes, ck/mb are flat, and has an elevated creatinine.  Likely
combination of renal failure and demand ishcemia in the setting
of sepsis, no need for heparin.
.
# Status-post femur fracture: continue knee immobilizer. On
tylenol for pain and PRN morphine.
.
# Schizophrenia/dementia: Hold po meds for now as patient unable
to take po's. Will continue home meds if appropriate with MS at
future date.
.
# COPD: cont albuterol/atrovent nebs
.
# Hx DVT: It appears patient had DVT in [**2195-3-25**], so it has
been 12 months since the DVT.  We have held warfarin for this
reason, but can be decided whether patient needs to continue for
prophylaxis at Rehab, given history of femur fracture.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Can resume synthroid once patient is
tolerating POs.
.
# FEN: Aggressive IVF resuscitation. Hypernatremia likely
related to volume depletion and lack of access to free water.
Continue IVF of LR. Currently strict NPO given aspiration, but
can resume PO if tolerating later.
.
# Ppx: PPI, sub-cutaneous heparin while warfarin is being held.
Can discontinue heparin SC and restart warfarin if appropriate,
as above.
.

.
# Code: DNR/DNI, no invasive procedures, no NG tubes, no
arterial lines. Discuss utility of future inpatient
hospitalizations with guardian.
