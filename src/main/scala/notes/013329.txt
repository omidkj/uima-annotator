Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
Shoulder/back/neck pain and SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy [**11-16**]
Endotracheal intubation
Femoral central line placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 38 yo female with pmh of lung cancer, cervical
cancer, and thyroid cancer (all unknown types) reported to be in
remission who presented to [**Hospital3 8834**] the
morning of admission with neck and left lateral pain radiating
toward the shoulder, with additional complaint of cough and
fever. At the OSH she underwent a CT which showed new LLL
consolidation vs. mass. She was given moxifloxacin, 2L IVF, and
dilaudid and started becoming hypotensive. For concern for
epidural abscess, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
further work-up and evaluation.

On arrival to the ED here her vitals were 74/42 HR 109 RR 18 and
sat of 97% on 4L NC. She received 3.5L of crystalloid in our ED,
plus 2L of crystalloid at the referring hospital. She had a
central line placed in the right femoral artery and was started
on levophed. Over the course of the day she had received 6 L
IVF. Her antibiotics were broadened with vancomycin. She was
also sent for a thoracic spine MRI, and developed an anaphylaxis
reaction to receiving gadolinium, for which she received 0.3mg
epinephrine, 125mg solumedrol, and was placed on non-rebreather
for dropping o2 sats. Ultimately she was intubated with
etomidate and succinylcholine.

Gentamicin was ordered in the EW, but not received.  She was
intubated and sedated and admitted to the unit.

Imaging:
[**2159-11-18**]   Radiology CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Evolution of new areas of mixed ground-glass and
consolidative opacities bilaterally, which given their focality
and the acuity of development are suggestive of bilateral
infectious progression. Follow up to resolution is recommended.
2. Redemonstration and evolution of pleural effusions and tiny
pericardial
effusion.

[**2159-11-17**]   Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT)
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-16**] and 3:
The frontal chest radiographs over the past 36 hours have
suggested the
development of a generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality,
but today's lateral view shows that the lower lobes are largely
spared, and that the process has a great deal of coalescence in
the right middle lobe. It also shows that the mass-like
consolidation first seen on the chest CT, [**11-15**] be
shrinking. Overall findings suggest multifocal infection,
partially treated, but perhaps due to more than one pathogen.
The interstitial abnormality is very mild, could be a pulmonary
drug reaction and is unlikely to be garden variety pulmonary
edema in the absence of mediastinal vascular engorgement,
progressive cardiac enlargement or pleural effusions. Findings
were discussed over the telephone with the intern caring for
this patient

[**2159-11-15**]   Radiology CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism. No aortic dissection.
2. Anteromedial left lower lobe opacity concerning for pulmonary
mass,
although consolidation is possible.
3. Post-surgical changes and likely post radiation treatment
changes of the right upper lung. Right upper lobe pleural fluid
and thickening. Please correlate with medical and surgical
history and prior chest CTs.
4. Right upper lobe focal opacity that may represent
post-treatment change vs infection. These findings are of
uncertain chronicity and comparison with prior studies would be
helpful.
5. Small pericardial effusion/thickening.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pneumococcal PNA: Met SIRS criteria at admission given fever,
leukocytosis, tachycardia, plus presumption of infection based
on CT scan abnormality. She was intubated for respiratory
distress in the context of anaphylactic reaction to gadolinium
while in the ER and admitted to the unit. She was extubated
successfully on HD2.  Treated in MICU with [**Last Name (un) **], vanco, levo.
Bronchoscopy done in the MICU showed purulent secretions, gram
stain negative, and culture negative. CXR [**11-17**] showed worsening
b/l infiltrates.  CT chest [**11-18**] revealed evolution of pleural
effisions and tiny pericardial effusion and b/l mixed
ground-glass opacities.  Meropenem and vancomycin stopped
because MRSA was not grown.  She was discharged on levofloxacin
(to complete a 2 week course) as her OSH reports were
significant for pan senstive pneumococcus.  Pulmonology was
consulted and felt that her consolidations found on repeat CT
imaging were likely due to anaphylactic response to Gad rather
than worsening PNA d/t lack of symtpoms.  Unfortunately, she did
not finally see the pulmonary attending, as she left before this
could happen.  Given her history of lung adenocarcinoma, she
will need follow up chest imaging in [**5-21**] weeks to ensure
resolution of her pneumonia.

Anxiety/Depression: She was continued on her home medication
regimen.  She was started on doses she could recall and did well
in-house.  She requested some Xanax to hold her over until her
next appointment and was given a 2 week prescription.

Anemia: She was found to have anemia (Hct of 35.8) on admi
