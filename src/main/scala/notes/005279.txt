Pertinent Results:
[**2121-10-10**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound
Right ICA with no stenosis.
Left ICA with no stenosis.

[**2121-10-13**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= XX %). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
output. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST. CPB:
1. Globally improved LV systolic function EF = 55%
2. Preserved RV systolci function.
3. No other change in valve structure and function

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2121-10-10**] for surgical
management of her coronary artery disease. Plavix was allowed to
clear over the next several days. She was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which
showed no significant internal carotid artery disease. On
[**2121-10-13**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where she
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels.
(Please see operative note for details.) She weaned from bypass
on Neosynephrine and Propofol.  Postoperatively she was taken to
the intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the next 24 hours
she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated.

She was stable, requiring pressors for several days.  This was
weaned off by POD 3 and low dose Lopressor was resumed. She was
then transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.

The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with
her postoperative strength and mobility. She was gently diuresed
towards her preoperative weight. Socila services was visited her
to discuss social and personal issue due to her depression and
anxiety.  She became ambulatory, her hemodynamics remained
stable and she was ready for discharge.  A transfer to a
rehabilitation facility was initiated to allow further recovery
before discharge to an independent situation.

Follow up,restrictions and medications were as noted in the
sumary elsewhere.
