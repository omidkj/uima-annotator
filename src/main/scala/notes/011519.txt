PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Pulse 79, blood pressure
160/97, oxygen saturation 94% on room air.  Patient is awake,
alert and oriented times three.  Heart regular rate and
rhythm.  Lungs clear bilaterally.  No peripheral edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2190-7-16**], for a coronary
artery bypass graft times two with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**].  The
patient had a left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal.
Please see operative note for further details.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.  The patient was
weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation early on his
first postoperative night.  The patient was in atrial
fibrillation postoperatively and on postoperative day one
patient required nitroglycerin drip for control of his blood
pressure.  The patient had been started on an alcohol drip as
patient's family reported that he had previously had problems
withdrawing from alcohol.  On postoperative day two the
patient began ambulating with Physical Therapy.  The patient
remained hemodynamically stable.  The alcohol drip was weaned
to off.  The patient was started on a CIWA scale for
withdrawal prophylaxis and patient was restarted on all of
his preoperative medications for depression and anxiety.
Patient was noted to have an elevated white blood cell count.
On postoperative day two it was noted to be 25.  On
postoperative day three it decreased to 21.  The patient was
afebrile and had no signs or symptoms of infection.  The
patient remained in atrial fibrillation.  The patient was
started on antihypertensive medications which he tolerated
well.  He was diuresing spontaneously.  His chest tubes were
removed without difficulty.  Pacing wires were removed on
postoperative day three without difficulty.  The patient was
ambulating with Physical Therapy.  On postoperative day four
the discussion about anticoagulation for the patient's atrial
fibrillation was undertaken.  The patient previously had not
been anticoagulated as he has a history of falls in the past
as well as his history of alcohol abuse.  Discussion was
undertaken with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 48626**], cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and the
patient's daughter.  It was agreed by all parties that
attempts at anticoagulation would be undertaken and patient's
behavior and risk factors for falls, i.e., alcohol intake,
would be monitored carefully by the daughter as well as by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 48626**] and if patient continued to drink excessively or
seemed to be at risk for falls, the daughter would discuss
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 48626**] and the Coumadin would be discontinued.  On
postoperative day five patient completed level five physical
therapy.  Patient had been started on Coumadin and on
postoperative day six patient was cleared for discharge to
home.
