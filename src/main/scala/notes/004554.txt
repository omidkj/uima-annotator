History of Present Illness:
62 yo M w/ CAD (on ASA/Plavix), chf ef 40%, MVR, PTSD and recent
admission for incisional hernia repair, presenting to the ED w/
DOE/weakness and multiple episodes of melena.

Since dischrage from the hospital of [**2164-5-4**] pt. noted resolved
abdominal pain, persistent anorexia and fatigue.  Most notably,
4-5 days PTA, noted profoundly worsening DOE, dyspneic even
after taking a few steps as well as a occipital headache, for
which he started to take Ibuprofen 600mg [**Hospital1 **].   In addition,
noted sensation of orthostasis, but no syncope.  On [**5-8**] noted
an episode of black stool x2 with repeated stools for the
remainder of the week.  He decided to be evaluated today due to
worsening melena 4-5 episodes as well as profound
lightheadedness and DOE (just standing up was sufficient to make
him SOB).  He reports occasional chills x2 days but no frank
fevers.  His constipation improved after cessation of opioid
use. He reports no n/v or abdominal distension.  No changes in
diet, no use of steroids.  Has a hx of hemorrhoids, but has not
had sx lately, no BRBPR despite having to strain over the past
several days.  No recent medication changes.

In the ED, initial VS were: 96.8 118 121/70 16 100% 10L
Non-Rebreather.  Exam was notable for benign abdomen and guiac
positive black stool, PPI gtt w/ 80mg bolus, Cipro 400mg IV.
Labs were notable for WBC of 20K w/ left shift, HCT of 38, HCO3
18 w/ AG 12, BUN of 48 and K of 5.4 and lactate of 2.3, PTT 24
and INR 1.1.  CXR was w/o an acute process.

Of note, pt. was hospitalized [**5-1**] - [**5-4**] for abdominal hernia
repair.  This was uncomplicated.  Unfortunately, no labs draw
during that admission.

Baseline exercise capacity: becomes dyspneic with moderate
exercise (pushing a motorbike up a ramp or round the block).

VS on transfer 185/x 115 14 100% RA.

Studies:

EGD [**5-12**]:
Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Erythema and congestion in the duodenal bulb and second part of
the duodenum compatible with Moderate duodenitis
Erythema in the antrum compatible with Mild gastritis
Medium hiatal hernia
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Recommendations: The findings do not account for the symptoms
Prilosec 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Keep NPO, ice chips OK.
Check H. Pylori Ab and treat if positive.
CT angiogram.

CTA [**5-12**]:
1. No evidence of active bleeding within the gastrointestinal
tract.
2. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of acute
diverticulitis.
3. Rim-enhancing fluid collection with small locules of air, in
the
epigastric region just deep to the abdominal wall at the site of
recent
hernia. While this could represent a postoperative seroma, a
superimposed
infection cannot be excluded. Recommended clinical correlation.

Capsule Endoscopy [**5-14**]:
Summary: Sub-optimal bowel prep. Small erosions in the stomach
(gastritis), mild duodenitis, duodenal lymphangiectasia and
small
non-bleeding angioectasia(s) in the proximal jejunum. Melanotic
material was seen from the mid jejunum to the proximal colon.
Recommendations: In-patient care, transfuse as needed and
proceed
with a single balloon enteroscopy.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo M w/ CAD (on ASA/Plavix), MVR, PTSD and recent admission
for incisional hernia repair who presented on [**2164-5-12**] with dark
tarry stools and was found to have leukocytosis to 19.5. His
melena was initially concerning for an UGIB in the setting of
NSAID use. He received two units of PRBC.  An EGD was done and
showed only duodenitits and no active bleeding or ulcers.  The
patient then underwent a CTA abdomen/pelvis, which showed no
acute bleed and a 6cm fluid collection around the hernia repair
thought to be either abscess or seroma. He was admitted for
monitoring. His remained afebrile, his WBC count decreased and
he developed no symptoms around the prior hernia site and thus
the fluid collection was not aspirated. His H. pylori antibody
returned negative.  For a couple days he continued to have
melena and so on [**2164-5-14**], the patient underwent capsule endoscopy
which found small erosions in the stomach consistent with
gastritis, mild duodenitis, duodenal lymphangiectasia, and small
non-bleeding angioectasia(s) in the proximal jejunum. Melanotic
material was seen from the mid jejunum to the proximal colon.
Following the prep for the capsule study he no longer had any
further episodes of melena and  his hematocrit remained stable
for several days. He was started on a PPI and was discharged
home on his home medications per his cardiologist with plans for
continued outpatient GI followup. Of note, by the day of
discharge he was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating and
voiding without difficulty. He had no abdominal pain, was
hemodynamically stable and had bowel movemetns without melena or
bright red blood.
