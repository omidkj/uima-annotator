Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxemic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pulmonary artery catheter placed [**2191-7-24**]
Arterial line placed [**2191-7-24**]
PICC line placed [**2191-7-27**] under fluroscopy
Rigid bronchoscopy with tracheostomy tube change [**2191-7-29**]


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 68 year old Cantonese gentleman who presents from
rehabilitation with hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Patient's history dates back to [**2191-2-8**] when he was admitted to
[**Hospital1 2177**] after after an acute anterior STEMI. Emergent
catheterization showed totally occluded LAD.Ballooning and stent
was attempted which resulted in poor TIMI flow. Pt developed
cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema necessitating placement of
intraaortic balloon pump and prolongued use of Mechanical
Ventilation.

ECHO showed an EF of 35 % with akinetic midventricle to apex, Pt
developed VAP with Pseudomonas in sputum (received a full course
of Cefepime and Vanc), and persistent pleural effusions which
were consistenly a transudate .

Pt did not tolerate multiple CPAP trials due to progressive CHF
and altered mental status, and had a tracheostomy on [**2191-3-7**].

He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for rigid bronchoscopy and
electrocoagulation due to hemoptysis. No source of bleeding was
found. He was diuresed and discharged to rehabilitation in
[**Hospital1 8**] on [**2191-4-21**].

On the day of admission the patient was found cyanotic. His BP
was 126/60 with HR 60s, RR 40s. He was noted to have diminished
lung sounds at the right lower base. He had been on the vetn at
CMV 500/50/14/5. He was taken off the vent and bagged with sats
78-82% only. He was therefore transfered here.

When he arrived in the ED his temperature was 96.2, HR 130s, BP
176/60, O2 sat 98% on 100% O2 via ambubag. Several minutes after
his arrival in the ED he had another episode of hypoxia and ABG
showed 7.41/53/55. He was baged and sats increased. Patient was
intermittantly agitated and grabbing at his tracheostomy. His
sats intermittantly went down to 86%. He received aspirin 325
mg, levoquin 50 mg IV and lasix 20 mg IV. UOP was 1200cc.

Past Medical History:

Pulmonary HTN
S/P ATN
COPD c chronic ventilator dependence
PUD
Hypoxic encephalopathy?
Malnutrition
CHF with EF 35%


Social History:
Patient used to live alone in an apartment in [**Location (un) 86**] but since
his admission to [**Hospital1 2177**] for acute MI has been living at [**Hospital **]
Rehabilitation. He has no known family in this county but does
have a [**Social Security Number 33956**]security number and was collecting food stamps. He
has a court appointed guardian, [**Name (NI) 31736**] [**Name (NI) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31737**], who
was appointed due to concern at [**Hospital1 **] that the patient was
inconsistant and could not consent to procedures.
