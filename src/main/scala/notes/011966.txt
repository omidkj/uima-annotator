History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F h/o remote TB, insomnia, anxiety lost to PCP f/u for 5 years
(reportedly has purposefully avoided MD's) p/w 4 days of low

[**2196-11-22**] Chest X-ray:
AP AND LATERAL CHEST: Extensive pleural thickening, volume loss,
and
rightward mediastinal shift is again identified. While, these
findings are in keeping with the report from the [**2188-4-9**]
chest radiograph, that study noted "shift of the superior
mediastinum" whereas we are seeing complete mediastinal shift
today. There is again evidence for underlying COPD and the left
lung remains clear. Calcification of mediastinal/hilar lymph
nodes is identified, as is a 5 mm calcified pulmonary nodule at
the left lung base. Right midlung calcifications are noted
laterally. No pleural effusion is seen. Atherosclerotic
calcification of the aortic arch is observed.
Multilevel thoracolumbar spondylosis is noted with severe
wedging of T12 and moderate anterior wedging of L2, of unknown
chronicity. Mild degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joints
are noted bilaterally.
IMPRESSION:
1. Chronic pleural thickening, volume loss, and rightward
mediastinal shift, though comparison is limited to the report
from 3/[**2188**].
2. COPD with no definite focal consolidation.
3. Multilevel thoracolumbar vertebral body wedge deformities, of
unknown
chronicity.
.
[**2196-11-22**] CT Head:
FINDINGS: There is prominence of the subdural space along the
left cerebral convexity which likely represents a left subdural
hygroma. There is no shift of normally midline structures and no
acute intracranial hemorrhage or large vascular territoral
infarct is observed. Mild sulcal and ventricular prominence is
consistent with age related atrophy. Mild periventricular and
subcortical white matter hypodensity is consistent with chronic
small vessel ischemic changes. Atherosclerotic calcification and
possible aneurysmal dilatation of the cavernous carotid arteries
are observed bilaterally.
Bone windows reveal no fracture. The imaged portions of the
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Prominence of the left
convexity
subdural space likely represents a subdural hygroma.
2. Possible aneurysmal dilatation of the cavernous carotids
bilaterally.
Nonurgent evaluation with CTA or MRA is recommended.
.
[**2196-11-22**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
Final Report
FINDINGS: Volume loss at the right lung base is partially
observed with
scattered pleural calcifications noted.
The liver demonstrates diffuse fatty infiltration without focal
abnormality identified. The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands
appear unremarkable. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and
excrete normally without hydronephrosis or hydroureter. A small
right renal interpolar hypodense lesion measures 5 mm and is too
small to characterize but likely represents a cyst.
Atherosclerotic calcification involving the abdominal aorta and
its branches, though the abdominal aorta is of normal caliber.
An irregular collection of extravisceral air is noted adjacent
to small bowel loops in the left mid abdomen, extending into the
mesentery and surrounding mesenteric vessels. This likely
represents a combination of pneumatosis and free mesenteric air.
No portal venous gas is seen and the celiac, superior mesenteric
artery, and inferior mesenteric artery appear patent. There is
no evidence for obstruction as orally administered contrast has
passed through into proximal colonic loops. No leakage of oral
contrast is seen.
.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid colon appear
unremarkable
with a Foley catheter present within the bladder. A large
partially calcified heterogeneous fundal exophytic fibroid is
located anteriorly and measures approximately 4.8 x 4.7 cm in
greatest axial dimensions. No free pelvic fluid is seen and no
pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph nodes are observed.  Bone
windows reveal multilevel thoracolumbar degenerative changes
with anterior moderate-to-severe wedge compression deformities
involving T12 and L2. Diffuse anasarca and muscle atrophy is
noted.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Left abdominal small bowel pneumatosis and free air within
the mesentery. Although this is of unclear etiology, ischemic
bowel is of greatest concern.
2. Compression deformities of T12 and L2 are of unclear acuity.

3. Fibroid uterus.
4. Fatty liver.
.
ADDENDUM: There is marked circumferential wall thickening of a
short segment of ascending colon. This is best seen in the
coronal plane (300B:20) and spans approximately 3.0 cm in the CC
direction. Within the bowel lumen there is an ovoid focus of
mesenteric fat with small vessels representing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]- colonic
intussusception. The ileocecal valve is visualized and appear
