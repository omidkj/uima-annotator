Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation & mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
37 yo F with PMH of recurrent bronchitis transferred from OSH
after presenting there BIBA after being found hypoxic to 50% on
RA and intubated in the field.  Per her husband and mother, the
patient was feeling poorly when she went to work Friday night.
Came home Saturday morning and slept all day Saturday and
Sunday.  Her mother called 911 when she found the patient
looking 'dusky' and she did not recognize her mother. [**Name (NI) **] EMS
report, she was 50% on RA. At OSH she was intubated, received a
dose of vanc/zosyn, CXR showed 'white out' and she was
transferred here.

In the ED here, she required high amounts of PEEP.  When she was
switched to the vent she was bagged initially with sats 85-95%.
When she was first placed on the vent, O2 sats dropped to 70s%.
She was placed back on the bag and sats returned.  Eventually
back on vent satting ok.  Blood pressures were borderline 90-100
and she required dopamine for a short time but got 1L IVF and
dopa was weaned off prior to transfer to the unit.

In the ED, her FAST exam was negative, BHG negative, trop 0.04
(?0.6 at OSH but no documentation).  Cards was c/s given concern
for pulmonary edema based on CXR which showed no pericardial
effusion, but overall 'squeeze' given her age.  RIJ placed.  VS
prior to transfer: BP:113/91 off dopa HR: 103 91% on 380x24 PEEP
18 100% FiO2.  She was given decadron for unclear reason
(resident signing patient out did not know).  No Tamiflu was
given.

ROS and history unable to be obtained as patient in intubated
and sedated.

[**12-22**] TTE: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve is not well seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Grossly preserved biventricular systolic function.
Limited emergency study.

[**12-23**] CXR: An ET tube is noted in situ, terminating 5.1 cm above
the carina. There is an NG tube which is partially visualized up
to the hemidiaphragms. There are diffuse bilateral alveolar
opacities,
predominantly affecting the right, left mid and lower lungs.
There is no
pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. No displaced rib
fracture is
seen.
IMPRESSION: Extensive bilateral air space opacities opacities,
differential considerations include flash pulmonary edema
(cardiogenic and noncardiogenic), ARDS or severe multifocal
infection. Clinical correlation advised.

[**12-28**] CT Head/Neck: 1. No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or
other intracranial vascular abnormalities.
2. Moderate paranasal sinus disease.
3. Diffuse cervical fat stranding and reactive nodes may be
related to volume overload versus patient body habitus

[**12-29**] CT Chest: 1. Mild bilateral multifocal pneumonia.
 2. Bilateral small pleural effusions and associated compression
atelectasis.
 3. Borderline enlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes are
likely
reactive.

[**12-31**] Lower extrem U/S: Grayscale and color Doppler imaging of
the common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins are
performed bilaterally. Normal compressibility, flow, waveform,
and augmentation is demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus is
identified.
  IMPRESSION: No lower extremity deep venous thrombosis
bilaterally.

[**1-1**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: 1. Findings concerning for persistent
bibasal pneumonia. 2. Small amount of free in the pelvis,a
non-specific finding.

Brief Hospital Course:
37F w/respiratory failure c/w viral ARDS, coagluase negative
staph bacteremia, adrenal insufficienty, rash, and conjunctival
hemorrhage

# Respiratory failure: The patient had been experiencing several
days of cough and malaise leading up to her respiratory failure
and altered mental status, which appeared consistent with
systemic viral process. After being intubated in the field, she
had a prolonged intubation in the MICU, with difficulty weaning
her ventilator settings, most notably her PEEP. Viral studies
including influenza and respiratory viral screen were negative.
She was finally extubated on [**1-2**] and subsequently did very well
on mask and nasal cannula. She did experience desaturations to
the 80's while sleeping, so CPAP was placed for likely
obstructive sleep apnea. She was initially placed on broad
spectrum antibiotics, which were later pulled off, although
zosyn was temporarily restarted for CT findings concerning for
sinusitis. Throughout her time in the MICU she was also treated
with albuterol and atrovent. The patient had an HIV antibody
test sent on day of transfer to the floor, which was ultimately
negative.  She left after working with PT and uneventfully
weaning off of oxygen support.

# Hypotension: The patient was believed to be septic on arrival,
given fevers and leukocytosis. She initially did not require
pressors, but levophed was eventually started on [**12-23**]. Her
pressor requirement fluctuated throughout her stay in the MICU,
and was ultimately discontinued on [**1-1**].

# Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's AM cortisol was checked
for persistent hypotens
