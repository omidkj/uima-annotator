Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7881**]
Chief Complaint:
acute renal insufficiency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
34M with chronic systolic CHF with EF 20%, hypothyroidism,
DM-II, CVA, SDH, and 12 previous admissions over the past year
to [**Hospital1 **] as well as admissions to [**Hospital1 2025**] presents with headache and
dizzniess. Patient was discharged [**2123-11-8**]. He states that after
this, he began having daily headaches, 2-3x/day, [**2124-5-1**] in
severity, in different locations, pressure-like. H/a is not
worse upon waking, no photo/phonia-phobia, no visual sx, no neck
stiffness. Patient also c/o dizziness/lightheadedness, worse
with standing or walking. He usually stops to rest and symptoms
improve.
.
Patient also describes feeling "heavy all over." However he
denies any visible increase in swelling. He sleeps on [**11-27**]
pillows at baseline and has orthopnea on lying flat, denies PND.
He has a longstanding cough, productive of white-green sputum.
Had small amount of blood-tinged sputum today.

He has been trying to comply with low salt diet, but does add a
small amount of salt to food. He denies decreased PO intake, but
he has been "dry" and thirsty. He has been compliant with his
medications. He has taken a few extra doses of torsemide, about
1 extra per week.
Pt has chest pain at baseline, last episode was 4 days PTA, a/w
palpitations. Also c/o SOB worse than baseline.
.
In the ED, initial vs were T 97.1 P 73 BP 94/53 R 16 O2 sat 100%
on RA. His admission INR was 4.4, so he was sent to head CT
given his HA and supratherapeutic INR. The scan was negative for
bleed. His CXR was at baseline as was his BNP. His creatinine
was elevated to 5.6 from a baseline of 2.5. His SBP dropped to
82/40 and he was bolused 500mL NS and his blood pressure
improved to 100/37. He was admitted to the MICU for management
of acute on chronic renal insufficiency and hypotension. His
hypotension was asymptomatic and consistent with his known
systolic CHF with EF of 20%. He was monitored in the MICU
overnight then transfered to cards floor.
.

Urine culture [**11-20**] negative

CT Head ([**2123-11-19**]) -
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Unchanged foci of right frontal and left occiptal
encephalomalacia in
comparison to [**2123-8-4**].

Renal U/S ([**2123-11-20**])-
1. No hydronephrosis or other renal pathologies to explain new
onset acute
renal failure.
2. Left renal interpolar cortical thinning with an echogenic
focus likely
corresponds to exophytic cyst noted on multiple prior CTs,
unchanged.

CXR:
FINDINGS: Single lead left-sided pacer/AICD device is stable
with single lead extending to the expected position of the right
ventricle. Marked
cardiomegaly is again seen without significant change from the
prior study.
No overt pulmonary edema or pleural effusion is seen. No focal
consolidation is seen. Subtle evidence of old right-sided rib
fractures are again noted. Mild degenerative changes of the
spine are again seen.

IMPRESSION: Marked cardiomegaly, without significant interval
change. No
focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.

EKG at admission:
Baseline artifact precludes definite assessment. Probable atrial
fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response. Very low
voltage diffusely. Right axis deviation. Q waves in leads I and
aVL with very slow R wave progression may be due to underlying
anterolateral myocardial infarction. The findings could also be
due to non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, etc. Non-specific ST-T wave change with QTc
interval prolongation. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2123-10-15**] no diagnostic change. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

ECG [**11-20**]
Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2123-11-19**] multiple abnormalities and
differential diagnosis are as previously given. Clinical
correlation is suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
34M with a history of dilated CM [**12-28**] Chagas with EF 22%, AF, DM2
presents with headache, dizziness and acute on chronic renal
insufficiency.

# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Pt with a baseline Cr of
2.5, was 5.6 on presentation.  Volume status was difficult to
assess. On one hand, weight was 20 lbs elevated above his
optimal dry weight and 10 lbs elevated since [**11-16**], he had
elevated JVP and S3 at admission. CXR and BNP were at baseline.
However, patient had been feeling dry, thirsty and describes
symptoms of orthostasis. FeUREA was c/w pre-renal etiology.
Also, his creatinine improved upon holding his diuretics.
Renal U/S neg for obstruction. UA and urine sediment
unremarkable. CR continued to improve to baseline.  During his
admission, patient was followed by renal and his diuret
