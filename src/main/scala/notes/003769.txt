HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 81-year-old white male
was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization after a
positive stress MIBI.  He has had a history of prior TIAs and
known atherosclerotic disease.  He denied any chest
discomfort or shortness of breath and was in his usual state
of health.  He did have a pacemaker implanted several years
ago for a rapid heart rate.  He had an echocardiogram in [**Month (only) 205**]
which revealed an EF of 35-40%, severe LVH with anteroseptal,
inferoseptal, and inferior hypokinesis and apical akinesis.
The LA was moderately dilated.  He had [**11-21**]+ MR, [**11-21**]+ TR,
moderate pulmonary hypertension, minimal AS and trace AI.  He
had a positive stress test on [**2166-7-1**] and was referred for
cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Infrarenal AAA 4.8 by 4.4 cm.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Status post CVA/TIA.
5.  Status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies in [**12-21**].
6.  History of hyperlipidemia.
7.  History of chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine
of 1.7 to 2 baseline.
8.  History of noninsulin-dependent diabetes.
9.  Status post pacer placement.
10. Status post appendectomy.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Uniretic 15/25 one p.o. q.d.
2.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Toprol XL 25 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Albuterol two puffs q.a.m.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives alone.  He quit smoking in [**2108**] and
does not drink alcohol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  He is an
elderly white male in no apparent distress.  Vital signs:
Stable, afebrile.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  The
extraocular movements were intact.  The oropharynx was
benign.  Neck: Supple, full range of motion.  No
lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids were 2+ and equal
bilaterally without bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
and percussion.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender with positive
bowel sounds and a pulsatile mass.  He also had a balloon
pump in place.  Extremities:  Without clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.  Pulses were 2+ and equal bilaterally throughout
except the DP and PT were only Doppler flow.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for cardiac
catheterization.  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2166-8-5**].  The left main revealed mild
distal disease, LAD had a proximal 95% stenosis, was heavily
calcified with serial 80% mid and distal stenoses, left
circumflex had a proximal 90% stenosis at the bifurcation of
the left circumflex and OM1 with a questionable occluded
proximal marginal midvessel 80% left circumflex disease.  The
RCA had serial diffuse 50-60% stenosis with midvessel 80%
stenosis.

He had a balloon pump placed in the Catheterization
Laboratory and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] was consulted.  He had carotid
ultrasounds done which revealed no evidence of stenosis.

On [**2166-8-6**], the patient underwent a CABG times three with
LIMA to the LAD, reverse saphenous vein graft to OM, reverse
saphenous vein graft to RPDA.  The cross clamp time was 54
minutes.  Total bypass time 80 minutes.  He was transferred
to the CSIU on Neo, milrinone, and propofol.  He was
extubated on postoperative night and he was still on his
milrinone and Neo.  He also had his pacemaker interrogated
and the atrial lead was not working appropriately.  He will
have this dealt with as an outpatient.  He went back into his
chronic atrial fibrillation.  He was slowly improving.

On postoperative day number two, he had acute hypoxia and
Pulmonary was consulted.  They recommended inhaled steroids.
Following this consult, he had hemoptysis.  He had an urgent
intubation and had large clots removed from his airway.  He
had hypotension at this time as well.  He was re-Swanned.
His cardiac index was stable.  This hemoptysis resolved
eventually and he remained sedated and had a slow milrinone
wean for the next couple of days.  He was extubated again on
postoperative day number five and required aggressive
respiratory therapy.

He had his chest tubes discontinued on postoperative day
number six.  His milrinone was discontinued as well.  He was
on levofloxacin for his secretions.  He slowly improved,
weaning off his 02 requirement.

On postoperative day number nine, he was transferred to the
floor in stable condition.  He continued to improve and was
diuresed.  He was also started on nutritional supplements and
he continued to improve.  On postoperative day number 13, he
was discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition.

LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  Hematocrit 29.4, white count
13,300, platelets 347,000.  Sodium 139, potassium 4.1,
chloride 104, C02 27, BUN 50, creatinine 1.9, blood sugar 91.
PT 15, INR 1.5.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Albuterol MDI one to two puffs q.a.m.
3.  Combivent one to two puffs q.i.d. p.r.n.
4.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times seven days and then
decrease to 400 mg p.o. q.d. times seven days and then
decrease to 200 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Coumadin 1 mg p.o. q.d. for an INR goal of 1.5 to 2.
6.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for seven days.
