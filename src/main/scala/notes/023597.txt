Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2135-5-4**] Mitral valve repair (32 mm [**Company **] CG future ring)

History of Present Illness:
74-year-old male with history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy
status post AICD/PPM in [**11/2132**] and known mitral valve
regurgitation followed by serial echocardiograms. He was
admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] this past [**Month (only) 958**] with congestive heart
failure which was treated with aggressive diuresis. An
[**Month (only) 461**] revealed an ejection fraction of 26%, biatrial
enlargement, 4+ mitral
regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic insufficiency. He
admits to some fatigue and dyspnea with exertion however he does
not claim to be limited in his activities. Given the severity of
his mitral valve disease and his episode of heart failure, he
has been referred for surgical management. He was originally
seen as an inpatient [**2135-2-22**] and returns today for pre-op
cardiac
catheterization. of note, he has a large lipoma on his right
forhead which he is anxious to have removed.


Past Medical History:
1. Dilated cardiomyopathy with previous coronary catheterization
without significant CAD, last EF in [**11/2132**] 23%, s/p
biventricular pacemaker and ICD
2. Hypertension
3. CKD, baseline creatinine around 2
4. Hearing loss
5. History of pulmonary embolism in [**1-/2132**], status post six
months of anticoagulation, now off anticoagulation
6. Prostate Cancer
7. Hypothyroidism
8. Inguinal Hernia, evaluated by surgery
9. Old right occipital infarct, with associated encephalomalacia
and ex vacuo effect (patient denies Hx of stroke).

Carotid Bruit      Question left bruit vs transmitted murmur

Pertinent Results:
[**2135-5-4**] Echo: Prebypass: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis/dyskinesis of the inferoseptal, inferior, and
inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the septal, anteroseptal,
anterior, anterolateral, and lateral walls. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt. The
mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Postbypass: The patient is on infusions of milrinone,
vasopressin, and norepinephrine and is AV paced at 80 bpm. There
is an annuloplasty ring in the mitral position which appears
well seated. Mitral regurgitation is now trace. Peak/mean
gradients through the valve are 2/0 mmHg at a cardiac output of
3 L/min and 4/1 mmHg at a cardiac output of 4 5 L/min. Right
ventricular function and left ventricular function are
unchanged. The thoracic aorta is intact post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**5-4**] Mr.[**Known lastname 10029**] was admitted taken to the  operating room and
underwent  mitral valve repair with a size 32 CG Future band,
[**Company 1543**]. Cardiopulmonary Bypass time= 63 minutes, Cross clamp
time= 40 minutes. Please see operative report for further
details.  He received Cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics
and transferred to the intensive care unit for post operative
management.  He required vasopressin, Levophed, and Milrinone
for hemodynamic support.  That evening he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
complications. Electrophysiology was consulted and his permanent
pacemaker was interrogated.  On post operative day one he was
started on Captopril and Milrinone weaned off.  However on post
operative day two he went into atrial fibrillation, requiring
Amiodarone, and Milrinone was restarted due to decreased cardiac
output.  Mr. [**Known lastname 10029**] became progressively oliguric and was
started on Lasix. Levophed was again required due to hypotension
after Captopril. Inotropes and pressors were titrated for
hemodynamics, and Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.
   His renal function continued to worsen requiring increasing
doses of Lasix and Zaroxolyn.  On [**5-11**] he was re-intubated for
hypoxia and pulmonary edema requiring a Lasix drip for diuresis
in acute renal failure.  He was started on Coumadin and heparin
for anticoagulation due to ongoing atrial fibrillation.  On [**5-12**]
he was cardioverted and returned to sinus rhythm.  That evening
was able to wean off Levophed and progressively over next 24
hours was weaned off epinephrine.  Heparin drip was stopped when
INR was 2.2 and continued on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
Amiodarone drip was converted over to oral Amiodarone.  On [**5-15**]
he was extubated without complications and continued to remain
stable on milrinone.  His Lasix was changed from drip to bolus
dosing.  He remained in the intensive care unit for monitoring
and remained stable. He was ultimately weaned off inot
