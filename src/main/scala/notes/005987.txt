Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, Syncope on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation [**9-8**] and [**9-14**]
Trach tube placement on [**9-15**]


History of Present Illness:
This is a 79 year-old male with a history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia who presents for evaluation of dyspnea and
syncope on exertion. Per team on the floor, the dyspnea on
exertion and syncope have been getting progressively worse over
the course of the last 2 months. Pt's functional capacity is
extremely limited; he is now only able to go from the bed to the
bathroom and even this makes him presyncopal and dyspnic.  Pt
has been having syncopal espisodes with prodrome for 2 years.
On day of admission, pt was rushing to the bathroom when he had
a syncopal episode.  It is unclear if he syncopized while
running to the bathroom or on the toliet.  His son called the
ambulance.  The chest pain occured while the patient was
recovering from syncope. The patient describes pain as [**4-30**], L
shoulder tapping pressure, not radiating, not a/w nausea
diaphoresis or shortness of breath. It resolved after about 10
minutes. Patient denies symptoms at rest.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T: 97.4 HR:82 BP:127/78 RR: 28.
EKG showed a fib, PVCs.  Pt. was admitted for further evaluation
and management.
.
On the floor, VS were:  T98.8, BP 128/55, P 59, R20, O2 sat 98%
on 2L.  Pt was also noted to be orthostatic.  BB and ACEI were
decreased.  Pt was planned for cardiac cath to evaulate coronary
anatomy as cause of DOE and initiation of sotalol afterwards for
PAF and possible contribution to dyspnea.  Pt has been on
heparin gtt for subtherapeutic INR while in A fib with possible
planned cardioversion.  Of note, PTT has been >150.
.
At 8:40 AM on [**2161-9-8**], pt was found unresponsive, slumped to the
right, by nursing.  He did slightly lift his head but would not
follow commands.  On examination by house officers, he was found
slumped to the right.  He lifted his head to sternal rub.
Pupils were equal and reactive, though sluggish.  His right arm
was noted to be flexed and rigid.  Code stroke/blue was called.
BP was 155/114.  HR was 114.  Throughout the code, pt maintained
a blood pressure and pulse of 80-100.  Pt did desat to 80s.  Pt
was found to have copious oral secretions and after suctioning
O2 sats improved to 100%.  A blood gas showed 7.19/109/254
during the code; it is unclear what the O2 sat was at the time.
He was intubated for airway protection.  Of note, he was noted
to have vomit on his [**Doctor First Name **].  Head imaging including CT and CTA
head showed no acute event preliminarily.  Neuro evaluated the
pt and found no focal neurologic deficits.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
EKG demonstrated a. fib with PVCs, unchanged from [**2160-5-21**].
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated:  a fib with frequent PVCs, short period
of pacing.
.
2D-[**Month/Day/Year **] performed [**2160-5-20**] demonstrated: on Mild left
atrial/atrial appendage spontaneous echo contrast without
intracardiac or atrial/atrial appendage thrombus. Biventricular
cardiomyopathy. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Simple
aortic atheroma.
.
[**2161-9-7**] CXR: Bibasilar atelectasis, however, no evidence of
pneumonia.
.
[**12-27**]: Excercise Mibi:
1. The left ventricle appears to be more enlarged when compared
with the prior study.
2. The myocardial perfusion appears normal at the level of
exercise attained.
3. We could not perform a gated study due to multiple ectopics.

.
[**12-27**] Excercise ECG stress: In reviewing the stress test's EKG
component, it was difficult to interpret secondary to his AV
pacing. Throughout the stress test, the patient demonstrated a
rhythm that was paced with frequent polymorphic ventricular
premature beats and several ventricular couplets. Of note,
however, the patient had to
discontinue the study after 5 minutes with 3.2 METS representing

limited functional capacity study for his age. Also of note, the

patient had a drop in systolic blood pressure from 152/90 to
130/64.
