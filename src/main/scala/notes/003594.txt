Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old female with h/o TIAs, HTN, PAF s/p SSS
s/p pacer presented to OSH with 1 week nausea, SOB,
palpitations.  Found to have small left pleural effusion and
small pericardial effusion without tamponade.  Also her atrial
fibrilliation was controlled initially with amiodarone, and now
she is on a diltiazem drip.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible
lead revision versus removal of pacemaker if perforation.  She
had slight CHF by BNP but actually sounding pretty clear on CXR.
 Also with transient facial numbness.

Social History:
Lives alone.  No alcohol or tobacco.  Retired.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2167-9-28**]
Atrial fibrillation.
Nonspecific ST-T wave changes

Echo [**9-28**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF
60-70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is a moderate to large sized pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There is brief
right atrial collapse. There is significant, accentuated
respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows,
consistent with impaired ventricular filling and early cardiac
tamponade.

A pacemaker wire is seen in the right heart [**Doctor Last Name 1754**]; the tip is
at the apex of the right ventricle. Perforation cannot be
excluded with certainty, but the tip of the wire was not
visualized outside the epicardial surface of the heart.

Impression: moderate-to-large circumferential pericardial
effusion with early cardiac tamponade.

Catheterization:
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Pericardial effusion
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Successful pericardiocentesis.
2. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
COMMENTS:
1. Limited resting hemodynamics prior to pericardiocentesis
showed a
mildly elevated pulmonary pressure (PA mean 28 mmHg). The left
and right
sided filling pressures were elevated and entrained in the
pericardial
pressure (RA mean 14 mmHg, PCW mean 19 mmHg, RVEDP 19 mmHg,
Pericardium
mean 15 mmHg). The cardiac output was normal (CO 4.5 l/min, CI
2.15
l/min/m2).
2. The mean right atrial and pericardial pressure after
pericardiocentesis of 600 ml of fluid was 7 mmHg and 4 mmHg,
respectively. Cardiac output and index were essentially
unchanged (CO
5.0 l/min, CI 2.4 l/min/m2).
3. An echocardiogram after pericardiocentesis showed minimal
residual
fluid in the pericardium.
4. The pacemaker lead positions were confirmed with fluroscopy
together with the electrophysiology team.

Echo: [**10-1**]
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There is a small to moderate
sized pericardial effusion subtending the right atrial and right
ventricular free walls. The effusion is echo dense, consistent
with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right atrial
diastolic collapse is seen.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2167-9-30**], no major change is evident; a small-to-moderate
sized pericardial effusion without evidence of cardiac tamponade
persists.

CXR:
FINDINGS: Note is made of dual chamber cardiac pacemaker, with
two leads, one
terminating in the right atria appendage and the other one
terminating in the
right ventricle. No evidence of pneumothorax. Again note is made
of
cardiomegaly. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
compared with
previous study. Again note is made of bilateral pleural
effusions with left
lower lobe atelectasis, which is likely increased compared to
prior study.
Pulmonary vasculatures are within normal limits, and there is no
evidence of
cardiac failure.

There is no suspicious lesion in skeletal structures.

IMPRESSION: Cardiac pacemaker leads as described above. No
pneumothorax.
Cardiomegaly. Increased bilateral pleural effusion and
atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo woman who underwent pacemaker placement two
weeks prior to admission, found to have subsequent pericardial
and pleural effusions with moderate tamponade.  She then
underwent pericardiocentesis draining 600cc of fluid.  Following
the procedure she was observed in the CCU, where she remained
stable until returning to the cardiology service a few days
later.  After her pericardiocentesis, she underwent pacer lead
revision.  A repeat Echo showed stable small to moderate
effusion without evidence for tamponade.  She did have bilateral
pleural effusions, which were not clinically significant given
that her ambulatory saturations were >90% on room air.

Regarding her atrial fibrilliation, we titrated up her
beta-blocker because she was tachycardic upon exertion.
Cardioversion was not completed because anticoagulation is
contraindicated after pericardiocentisis.
