History of Present Illness:
This is a 72 year-old male with a history of UC on chronic
prednisone and MTX, scheduled for elective colectomy this am. He
was in his usual state of health until c yesterday when he
started experiencing worstening fatigue and weakness. He had no
po intake through out most of the day and in the evening had a
very low glucose level (?) and some chills, he had taken his
insulin but not eaten anything. He did not do anything about
this but lay down to sleep. This am he felt too weak to drive to
hospital by himself and called EMS to bring him for his surgery
to be done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]. Upon arrival EMS recorded
a blood pressure of 60/40, FS 118, got fluid and upon arrival in
ED SBP of 80-90, he was given 5 L fluid with some minimal
response response, central line was placed, Levophed was
started. Tmax of around 100, current vitals HR 70 BP 96/53 RR 22
O2 95% 4L NC
He was given stress dose Hydrocortisone, Zosyn, Vanco, Aspirin
(for possible st depression in V2-V4)
.
ROS: positive for shortness of breath, cough since 3 wks and
post nasal drip, Z-pack for 5 days w/o improvement, than got

Imaging/results:

EKG: NSR with frequent ectopy. Initially had lateral STDs

CXR #1: R>L lower lobe consolidation
CXR #2: increased RLL consolidation and R>L basilar Atx and mild
pulm edema
CXR #3: stable RLL consolidation, improved pulm edema
.
CT chest noncontrast [**12-6**] 1. Right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Possible underlying small airway disease involving right
lung.
2. No evidence of congestive heart failure.
.
.
CT a/p noncontrast [**12-6**]  Scattered mesenteric nodes do not meet
criteria for pathologic enlargement.    No evidence of bowel
obstruction or other acute abdominal process.
.
.
Echo [**12-4**]: mild LV dilation, mild LVH and LAE, DD, mild
depressed LVEF 40-50%, AK of basal/inf/post and HK
midvent/inf/post walls, mild RV dilation and free wall HK.
.
Echo repeat [**12-7**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal for the
patient's body size. There is an inferobasal left ventricular
aneurysm. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal inferior and inferolateral akinesis and
mid inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50
%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Left
ventricular diastolic function cannot be reliably assessed. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-12-4**],
the findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old male with h/o ulcerative colitis on chronic steroids
awaiting colectomy, pancytopenia [**2-10**] ?MTx, CAD s/p MI, with
recent viral cough X 3 weeks was admitted to  MICU [**12-4**] with
sepsis. He was found to have RLL PNA, s/p 5L IVF/pressors,
vanc/ceftriaxone/levaquin in MICU, sepsis resolved. He remained
afebrile. He did not grow organisms on sputum culture, but did
well when Abx were decreased to Levaquin alone. His urine
legionella was negative.  Repeat imaging showed a persistant RLL
infiltrate and he continued to require O2. He was discontinued
home on O2 (3-4L) for a short time.
.
He received stress/replacement dose steroids for several days,
but plan for rapid taper to baseline 30mg over next 4-5 days. He
had baseline pancytopenia, thought to be secondary to Mtx (no
BMB) for which he was followed as an outpatient by OSH
hematologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. His platelet count decreased to 30,
with increased petechiae, and hematology was consulted. He was
placed on neutropenic precautions briefly. His peripheral smear
was reviewed and did not show evidence of schistocytes. His
counts were monitored, and medications including heparin were
discontinued. H (vanc, H2B, heparin) and counts improved on own,
though he remains pancytopenic.
.
An echo was done on admission in the setting of sepsis which a
mildly reduced EF 40-50% and multiple WMA, but trops negative.
He has a h/o CAD s/p MI with cath [**1-16**] w/o intervention, likely
old changes and some acute depression in setting of sepsis. He
is asked to f/u with his cardiologist to get clearance prior to
colectomy, which is obviously delayed for the time being. Repeat
echo was done prior to discharge and showed preservation of his
ejection fraction, with evidence of persistent inferobasal left
ventricular aneurysm, unchanged from prior echocardiograms.
Given his preserved ejection fraction and lack of thrombus seen
on echo, decision was made not to start anticoagulation.
.
Finally, has h/o BPH with frequent symptoms and developed acute
urinary retention for which foley was placed. Finasteride was
started as well with a plan for a voiding trial in [**5-15**] days by
home nursing or PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] he fails his voiding trial, he should
have a urology referal placed by his PCP.
.
Has baseline diarrhea [**2-10**] UC, but some increased stools near
discharged, which resolved by day of discharge. Given multiple
issues, he was set up with home VNA services (respiratory,
nursing, PT and he plans on staying with his daughter for a few
days to recover. He will need close follow up with his PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 2085**], and hematologist.
