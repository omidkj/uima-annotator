Shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname 81165**] is a 86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and
aortic stenosis who presents for evaluation for possible AVR.
Patient presented to the hospital in [**3-13**] with shortness of
breath, fluid overload, and hypotension. She was found to have
critical aortic stenosis. She underwent valvuloplasty with
suboptimal results. Patient was discharged to rehab with
moderate improvement of her symptoms. After discharge patient
reevaluated her options and decided she was not content with her
quality of life. Her edematous legs and pulmonary edema has made
it impossible for her to be independently mobile. She requires
assistance for nearly all ADLs. She decided she was willing to
undergo surgical repair of her aortic valve in attempt to
improve her symptoms. She was seen by her physician who
recommended hospital admission for aggressive diuresis and a
complete preop evaluation.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient states she is comfortable and
without any pain. She thinks her shortness of breath has been
stable since her recent discharge but is unsure because she has
not been as mobile. She admits to significant increase in
bilateral lower extremity edema. She denies chest pain, nausea,
lightheadedness or diaphoresis. She denies any recent illness
with the exception of 1 day of diarrhea last week. She admits to
no other changes in her medical history since her last
admission.  The patient denies palpitations or syncope,
claudication-type symptoms, melena, rectal bleeding, or
transient neurologic deficits.  No change in weight or urinary
symptoms. No cough, fever, night sweats, arthralgias, myalgias,
headache or rash.  All other review of systems  negative.

[**2186-4-13**] CXR - Marked widening of right superior mediastinal
contour is consistent with intrathoracic extension of a goiter
as reported on recent CT. Heart remains enlarged. Mild pulmonary
vascular engorgement and new perihilar haziness are likely due
to congestive heart failure. Multifocal patchy and linear
opacities in the left mid and both lower lungs favor
atelectasis. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally.
[**2186-4-14**] Echo
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40%). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure
overload. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic
deformity. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area
1.5-2.0cm2). Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild LVH with moderate global systolic dysfunction.
Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Severe aortic
stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild valvular mitral
stenosis. Severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 year old female with a history of HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and
aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty was admitted for evaluation of
aortic valve replacement.
.
1. Aortic Stenosis:
She was diagnosed with critical stenosis during a prior
admission. At that time, she was not interested in surgical
aortic valve repair but did agree to a cardiac catheterization
with valvuloplasty. She had minimal improvement in her aortic
valve after valvuloplasty. She tolerated the procedure well and
was discharged to rehab. Given her persistent symptoms, she did
ultimatly agree to surgery. Unfortunately she was thought to be
a very high risk for surgery due to likelihood of a difficult
extubation and prolonged ventilator wean, and she was no longer
a candidate for surgical aortic valve repair. Given her limited
other medical options, she was not interested in additional
therapy. She was made DNR/DNI/ Do not rehospitalize and was
discharged to rehab with plans to transition to hospice.
.
2. Congestive Heart Failure:
Ms. [**Known lastname 81165**] was in acute on chronic systolic heart failure upon
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] likely worsened related to her severe aortic
stenosis. She was diuresed aggressively with a lasix drip and
then transitioned to oral lasix prior to discharge. She was
initially on 4L upon admission, required BiPap briefly, and was
back to 3-5L upon discharge. Her furosemide was transitioned
from a lasix drip to 120mg oral furosemide.
.
3. Hypoxia
Her hypoxia was likely multifactorial and related to her
congestive heart failure, valvular disease, kyphosis, and her
thyroid enlargement.
.
4. Atrial fibrillation
She has chronic atrial fibrillation and was maintained on a beta
blocker for rate control with coumadin for anticoagulation. She
was continued on her beta blocker and warfarin for symptomatic
control of her symptoms secondary to atrial fibrillation.
.
5. Goals of Care
Patient was initially full code upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**] in
anticipation of an aortic valve repair; however, when surgical
aortic valve repair was no longer an option, Ms. [**Known lastname 81165**] was
clear that she would not like any further interventions. She is
interested primarily in symptom control. She now has a do not
resuscitate, do not intubate, and do not rehospitalize order.
Her health care proxy, [**Name (NI) 3608**] [**Name (NI) 81166**], is aware of these wishes
and in full agreement. Palliative care was very helpful in
assisting with these discussions.
