CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2150-10-29**] 10:36 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate for pna

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
71 year old woman s/p AVR and mitral valve repair ([**10-21**]) and new
dual chamber PM via axillary vein left
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for pna
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Cough and fever.

PA and lateral upright views of the chest again demonstrates
enlarged but unchanged heart with no congestive heart failure.
The left chest wall pacemaker with two bipolar leads in the
right atrium and right ventricle is unchanged. There is no
pneumothorax.

There is no change in the left retrocardiac opacity, which most
likely represents atelectasis, but the pneumonia cannot be ruled
out.

The patient is after aortic valve replacement. The left pleural
effusion is small. The prosthetic device in the humerus is again
noted.

IMPRESSION: Left retrocardiac opacity representing most likely
atelectasis, pneumonia cannot be ruled out. Unchanged.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. Resting
bradycardic
for the
patient.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen
in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body
of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. The mitral annulus is 32mm at
long axis view.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%).

Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include hypokinetic
septal apex.

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.


There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
prosthetic aortic
valve leaflets are thickened with a single mobile prosthetic
leaflet. The
entire prosthesis is heavily calcified with a moderate aortic
stenosis with
peak gradient of 80 and a mean gradient of 40mm of HG. The
prosthetic
dysfunction is also characterized by wide opened aortic
regurgitation.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no flail or
prolapsing
segments and there is a suggestion of retracted posterior
leaflet. The mitral
regurgitation is central with a mild posterior direction and c/w
with moderate
mitral regurgitation.

There is no pericardial effusion.

POST_BYPASS:

A mechanical valve is seen well seated in the native aortic
position and is
functioning well with a mean gradient of 20mm of Hg. The
regurgitant jets are
typical of a mechanical bileaflet valve and no paraprosthetic
leaflets
visualized.

A ring is well seated in the native mitral position and there is
no mitral
regurgitation. The mean transmitral gradient is 5mm of HG.

Aortic contour is intact.

Preserved biventricular systolic function. Overall LVEF 55%.

Atrial fibrillation and ventricular paced rhythm. During magnet
induced rhythm
there is A-V sequential pacing without capture by the atrial
lead in the
context of atrial fibrillation. No diagnostic interim change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Readmitted on 91/18/06 for weakness and malasie.  Was medically
managed and continued cardiac surgery work up which included
dental evaluation for valve surgery.  Remained in hospital and
on [**2150-10-21**] was brought to the operating room and underwent an
aoritc valve replacement and mitral valve repair.  Please see
operative report for surgical details.  She tolerated the
procedure well and was transfered to the CSRU.  Later that day
she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and
was extubated.  On post operative day 1 she continued to require
pacing with an underlying rhythm of junctional escape rate of
30.  She continued on Neosynephrine for blood pressure and
diuresis was started.  On postoperative day 2 electrophysiology
was consulted related to junctional escape rhythm in 30's
requiring pacing then atrial flutter to sinus rhythm to complete
heart block.  On postoperative day 4 heparin was started and
continued to monitor rhythm.  On postoperative day 6 she
underwent dual chamber permanent pacemaker implantation and was
transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 2.  She continued to progress and coumadin
was started.  Physical therapy followed her to help with his
postoperative strength and mobility.  On post operative day 9
she was discharged home with VNA services.  Plan for INR to be
checked [**2150-11-1**] with results to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 931**]
