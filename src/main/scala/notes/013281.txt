History of Present Illness:
82 y/o female with HTN, Hyperlipidemia, DM2, PVD, CAD s/p CABG
and PTCA/Stent [**2117**] presented to [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital with
one month of worsening dyspnea on exertion with one day of acute
worsening dyspnea awakening her from sleep. She denies chest
pain. She had no increase in salt intake, no change in meds
other than her lasix which had been increased from 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] to
100 mg [**Hospital1 **] in the last two weeks. She also reports black stools
this past week, with increasing fatigue, dry cough, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, and generalized weakness.

On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, joint pains, hemoptysis. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
LABORATORY DATA:
BUN 76/Cr 2.2
Hct 30
CK 494 CK-MB 19 MBI 3.8
Trop-T 0.78
.
CK had a second increase on [**8-8**] up to 427 then trended down to
206 on discharge
.
Cr was 2.2 on admission, climbed to 5.4 on [**8-9**], then decreased
to 1.6 at time of discharge.
.
EKG demonstrated Lateral ST depressions slightly more pronounced
than prior from [**2-14**].
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed in [**2117**] demonstrated:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly decreased (LVEF45-50%). While not
well seen there appeared to be basal and mid inferior wall
hypokinesis.
3.The aortic valve is not well seen. A bioprosthetic aortic
valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is normal
for this prosthesis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
4.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Echo [**2120-8-5**]:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%). Tissue Doppler velocity
suggests an increased LVEDP (>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber
size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2118-7-8**], global left ventricular systolic
function is more depressed, the ascending aorta is now
moderately dilated (prior 4.2cm ascending on review), mild
mitral regurgitation and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
are now identified.
.
Renal ultrasound [**2120-8-13**]:
The patient is status post right nephrectomy.  The left kidney
measures 11.4 cm.  There is again seen a 1.4 cm simple cyst
within the left kidney.  Arterial waveforms suggestive of a
renal artery stenosis in the left kidney identified.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2120-8-16**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease. The mid-LAD
had a 95% heavily calcified stenosis, with the proximal stent
patent. The LCx demonstrated diffuse distal disease as in
previous studies. The distal RCA had a 70% stenosis with
proximal stents patent. The SVG was not engaged due to known
past total occlusion. The LMCA did not demonstrate any
angiographically apparent disease.
2. Selective renal angiography of the left renal artery
demonstrated a
90% heavily calcified stenosis.
3. Limited resting hemodynamic measurement revealed an elevated
systemic
arterial pressure of 167/65 mmHg.
4. Successful stenting of the mid LAD with 3.0 X 8 and 2.5 X 8
overlapping bare metal Mini Vision stents without residual
stenosis (see
PTCA comments for detail).
5. Successful stenting of the left renal artery with a 5.0 X 18
mm
Genesis stent postdilated to 7.0 without residual stenosis of
embolization, performed with distal protection device.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o female with HTN, Hyperlipidemia, DM2, PVD, CAD admitted
with NSTEMI.
.
1. NSTEMI:  This was initially medically managed in the setting
of a slow upper GI bleed.  Later, she developed acute renal
failure, and catheterization was again delayed out of concern
that the dye load would further injure her kidney.  Echo
demonstrated an EF of 40% and global hypokinesis as described in
the results section above.  Once it was felt that her renal
function was not improving and she was likely to end up on
dialysis, a cardiac catheterization was performed.  She had bare
metal stents placed to her LAD as described in the cath report
included.  She should be continued on aspirin 325mg ongoing,
plavix 75mg for at least one month, and simvastatin 40.  Once
her renal function has been followed for a couple of weeks and
remains stable, it would be recommended to start an ACE
inhibitor.
.
2. Upper GI bleed:
GI was consulted and did not feel that the patient was a
candidate for an EGD given her slow bleed.  She was tr
