Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2605**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB
Sepsis
Cellulitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of subclavian central venous catheter
Placement of PICC line
Removal of subclavian central venous catheter


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old non-diabetic female who presented
to the E.D. with history of 1 day of increasing confusion, left
leg pain, nausea/emesis, and loose stools without associated
fevers/rigors/chills. Patient's stools were noted to be
non-bloody and patient was without abdominal pain. On initial
admission, the patient was noted to have a SpO2 of 86% but rose
to 96% on RA in ED. A CXR at this time suggested pulmonary edema
for which the patient received 10mg IV lasix with subsequent
development of hypotension to 77/20 although the patient was
reported to be asymptomatic. In the E.D. the patient was started
on dopamine 5mcg/min for her hypotension.
Given the patient had leukocytosis with WBC of 16 with 35%
bands, the patient was given ceftriaxone and Vancomycin.  Given
LLE erythema, clinical impression was that the patient had a
likely cellulitis as source of infection.
.
On transfer to the MICU, a central line was placed and the
patient was transitioned to levophed briefly. Patient's labs on
transfer were noteable for a mild transaminitis, leukocytosis
and a lactate of 6. The patient's antibiotics regimen was
changed to Vanc and Zosyn, then again to Vanc, Cefepime and
Flagyl. The patient was reported to have received approximately
5 liters of fluid prior to transfer to the MICU. Given
moderately elevated blood sugars on admission the patient was
initally placed on an insulin gtt as well which was
transitioned rapidly to SC Insulin. The patient had a mildly
elevated troponin on admission that remained relatively flat
throughout her MICU course, likely elevated secondary to fluid
overload and possible demand ischemia in the setting of sinus
tachycardia with heart rate in the 130's. The patient had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**]
stim test that did not demonstrate adrenal insufficiency but was
remarkable for an elevated baseline cortisol of 46.
.
Since [**2152-2-26**] the patient has been weaned off pressors and fluid
support. The patient was to be called out of the MICU on [**2152-2-27**]
but her course was complicated at this time by tachypnea and
tachycardia with decreased O2 sats thought likely to represent
flash edema. The patient was diuresed with 20mg IV lasix with
good effect. Since this time, the patient's BP has been stable
if not mildly hypertensive and she has since been restarted on a
BB for her hypertension and tachycardia. The patient remains
mildly tachycardic with O2 requirement on transfer. The patient
had LENIs performed which were negative, making PE less likely
(although not completely ruled out) with her current vitals
thought to represent ongoing fluid overload for which the
patient is being diuresed. The patient has a goal balance on
transfer of 1L negative, currently -600cc. On transfer the
patient is currently receiving Vancomycin and Unasyn for broad
spectrum cutaneous coverage with plan for placement of PICC line
for extended course of IV abx given persistent leg erythema and
leukocytosis.
