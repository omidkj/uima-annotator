Date of Birth:   [**2051-9-18**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
male with a history of hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy,
monoclonal gamma globulin of undetermined significance, and
gout who presented to the Emergency Room on [**9-17**] with a
complaint of several days of nausea, vomiting, shortness of
breath, and cough.  The patient was in his usual state of
health until four days prior to admission when he developed
nausea and vomiting and was unable to tolerate anything p.o.

Apparently one day prior to admission the patient developed a
nonproductive cough associated with shortness of breath.  The
patient felt progressively weak and presented to the
Emergency Room.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's temperature was a
temperature to 101.7, blood pressure 99/60, heart rate 116,
respiratory rate 34, oxygen saturation of 93% on room air and
97% on 2 liters.  Chest x-ray showed left upper lobe
pneumonia.  Laboratories showed leukocytosis and a creatinine
of 6.6.  The patient's urine had muddy brown casts and
epithelial cells.  The patient was started on renally dosed
Levaquin, given intravenous fluids, and transferred to the
floor.

On admission to the medical floor, the patient had a
temperature of 102.1, blood pressure 112/60, and oxygen
saturation of 89% on room air.  Shortly thereafter, the
patient's blood pressure dropped to 85/40.  The patient was
bolused 1 liter of  normal saline with an increase in
systolic blood pressure to the 90s.  The patient was then
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy.  Transthoracic echocardiograms
in [**2116**] showed enlarge left ventricle with global hypokinesis
and an estimated ejection fraction of 20% to 25%.
3.  Multiclonal gamma globulin of undetermined significance.
4.  Gout.
5.  History of pneumonia requiring intubation in [**2115**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Zestril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Allopurinol.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives at home
with his wife.  The patient has eight children.  No tobacco
or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  On presentation to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit temperature was 99.5, blood
pressure 98/61, pulse 113, respiratory rate 24, oxygen
saturation 92% on 4 liters.  In general, the patient was
alert, in no acute distress.  HEENT revealed pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles
were intact.  Scleral icterus.  Oropharynx was clear.  Neck
was supple with no lymphadenopathy.  Lungs revealed coarse
dry scattered crackles bilaterally, left greater than right.
Heart examination revealed the patient was tachycardic,
regular rhythm.  No murmurs appreciated.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended, with normal bowel sounds.
Extremities had no edema.  Neurologically, alert and oriented
times three.  He moved all four extremities.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 11.5,
hematocrit 30.9.  Urinalysis revealed large blood, positive
nitrites, greater than 30 protein, large bilirubin, moderate
bacteria, muddy brown casts.  Chloride 99, bicarbonate 15,
BUN 81, creatinine 6.6.  Creatine kinase #1 was 532 with a MB
of 5.  Creatine kinase #2 was 422 with a MB of 3.  Liver
function tests revealed ALT 41, AST 58, alkaline
phosphatase 86, total bilirubin 8, albumin 2.2.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus
tachycardia [**Company 109175**] wave inversion in lead III, right
bundle-branch block (new from [**2118**] electrocardiogram with
exercised-induced on stress test in [**2122-1-26**]).

Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 40% to 45%,
left ventricular size was normal, moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation,
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  PULMONARY/INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted
with multilobar pneumonia, community-acquired.  Blood
cultures showed no growth to date, and sputum culture had
greater than 10 epithelial cells with contamination of
oropharyngeal secretions.  The patient was started on
intravenous Levaquin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin given
previous history of pneumonia requiring intubation.  The
patient improved clinically, and on hospital day four was
switched to p.o. Levaquin for a total of a 14-day course of
antibiotics.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient became hypotensive, likely
the result of significant hypovolemia from decreased p.o.
intake.  The patient responded to fluid boluses, but his mean
arterial pressure was 65.  Given the patient's acute renal
failure the patient was started on Levophed in order to
insure renal perfusion in the setting of acute renal failure.
The patient was on Levophed for less than 24 hours.

Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease, the
patient was sent for an echocardiogram which showed an
ejection fraction of 40% to 45%. Left ventricular cavity size
was normal with moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There was mild mitral regurgitation.  The patient did not
show any signs of congestive heart failure during this
admission.  The patient was restarted on all of his cardiac
medications at the time of discharge.

3.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure
with a creatinine of 6.6.  Acute renal failure was likely a
combination of prerenal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis.
The patient's FENa on presentation was 0.3 with urinalysis
showing muddy brown casts.  The patient received intravenous
fluids with a decrease in creatinine to 1.2 at the time of
discharge.

The patient also presented with metabolic acidosis with a
bicarbonate of 15 on admission.  Metabolic acidosis resolved
with intravenous fluids with bicarbonate of 23 at the time of
discharge.

The patient went for abdominal ultrasound to evaluate
elevated bilirubin.  Abdominal ultrasound showed a mass in
the kidney.  The patient subsequently went for a CT scan of
the abdomen which did not show any renal mass.

4.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient presented with a hematocrit
of 30.9 (baseline hematocrit of 33).  With intravenous fluids
the patient's hematocrit dropped to 26.6.  Hemolysis and DIC
panels were sent and were negative.  The patient was
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells with a post
transfusion hematocrit of 30.4.

5.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient presented with a direct
hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin peaking at 10.  In
addition, the patient had a slight transaminitis with ALT
peaking at 107 and AST at 177.  Elevated liver function tests
were likely the result of decreased perfusion to the liver at
the time of presentation.  The patient's liver function tests
gradually improved during the admission with total bilirubin
decreasing to 2.6 at the time of discharge.  On admission,
the patient's alkaline phosphatase remained elevated at 156.
In reviewing the patient's records, the patient has had
elevated alkaline phosphatase in the past.

The patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen which showed
gallstones but no cholecystitis.  CT was otherwise negative.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient was discharged to home.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. times
seven days for a total of 14 days of antibiotics.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Multilobar pneumonia.
2.  Acute renal failure.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Multiclonal gamma globulin of undetermined significance.
