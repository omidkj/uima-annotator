CHEST ONE VIEW, PORTABLE

INDICATION: 83-year-old man with intubation.

COMMENTS: Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest is
reviewed. No previous study is available for comparison.

The tip of the endotracheal tube is identified at the thoracic
inlet. A chest tube is identified overlying the right
hemithorax. There is no evidence for pneumothorax.

There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature with
cardiomegaly indicating mild congestive heart failure. There is
also prominence of the proximal pulmonary arteries indicating
pulmonary hypertension. Patchy opacity is seen in both lower
lobes indicating aspiration versus atelectasis.

The balloon of the endotracheal tube is slightly hyperinflated.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pneumothorax.
2. Hyperinflation of the balloon of the endotracheal tube.
3. Mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly. Aspiration
versus atelectasis in both lower lobes. Pulmonary hypertension.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST; CT RECONSTRUCTION

Reason: s/p MVC

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old man
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p MVC
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

ADDENDUM:

Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was telephoned to report a slight change in
the final report for this CT. There is concern for spinal cord
impingement and an MRI is recommended. One has been ordered.
This communication was on [**2190-6-24**] at 10:30 a.m.
INDICATION: 83-year-old in motor vehicle accident.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the cervical spine without IV contrast.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained. No prior studies.

FINDINGS: There is a type-[**12-24**] fracture through the dens, without
significant displacement of fracture fragments. The fracture
involves the right articular mass, body and left articular mass,
and extends through the left transverse process (and across the
vertebral canal). A small fracture fragment seen posterior to
the dens within the spinal canal, and may impress the cord. Ther
may also be an epidural hematoma. There is also a transverse
fracture through the spinous process of C5. There is a
questionable fracture at the C3 left facet joint, though this
may just represent severe degenerative changes. Soft tissue
hematoma is seen within the prevertebral soft tissues anterior
to C2 and 3.

Severe degenerative changes are noted throughout the cervical
spine with disc space narrowing, subchondral cyst formation, and
mild osteophyte formation. The cervical canal is also slightly
narrowed in the mid cervical spine.

Several small lymph nodes are seen within the neck.

IMPRESSION: Type-[**12-24**] fracture through the dens. Transverse
fractures through the posterior elements of C5. Severe
degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine. Evaluation
of the spinal canal and cord with MRI should be considered.
These findings were communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the
completion of the examination.

MR CERVICAL SPINE  [**2190-6-26**] 10:24 AM

MR CERVICAL SPINE

Reason: r/o C-spine injury

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old man with MVA , c-collar
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o C-spine injury
EXAM: MRI of the cervical spine.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with MVA and fracture of the
odontoid process and C5 vertebra seen on the previous CT, for
further evaluation.

TECHNIQUE: T1-, T2- and inversion recovery sagittal and gradient
echo and T2 axial images of the cervical spine were obtained.
Correlation was made with the CT of [**2190-6-23**].

FINDINGS: There is a fracture of the odontoid process
visualized, as seen on the previous CT examination. Subtle
increased signal on inversion recovery images is seen in the C2
vertebral bodies indicative of marrow edema. Additionally, there
is increased signal seen between the posterior arch of C1 and
spinous process of C2 indicative of ligamentous injury in this
region. There is no widening of the interspinous distance seen.
There is subtle soft tissue prominence at C1 and C2 level, both
posteriorly and anterior to the thecal sac with mild indentation
on the thecal sac without compression of the spinal cord. There
is no abnormal signal seen within the spinal cord at this level.

At C3-4, disc degenerative change and mild bulging is
identified. No spinal stenosis is seen.

At C4-5, low T1 and high T2 signal is seen in the C4 and C5
vertebral bodies secondary to marrow edema from trauma. CT has
demonstrated posterior element fracture at C5 level. At this
level, there is no evidence of ligamentous disruption seen
involving the intraspinous or posterior longitudinal ligaments.
No evidence of disruption of the anterior longitudinal ligament
is seen. Degenerative disc disease is noted with moderate
bilateral foraminal narrowing.

At C5-6 and C6-7 as well as inferiorly to T3-4, degenerative
disc disease is identified without high-grade spinal stenosis.

The spinal cord demonstrates no evidence of increased signal to
indicate cord edema or contusion.

IMPRESSION: Odontoid fracture with increased signal indicating
ligamentous trauma posteriorly between the posterior arch of C1
and spinous process of C2. Mild soft tissue prominence, both
anterior and posterior to the thecal sac at C1-2 level indenting
the thecal sac without high-grade spinal cord compression. These
changes could be secondary to trauma. Marrow edema within C4 and
C5 vertebral bodies. Multilevel degenerative changes. Increased
signal within the posterior soft tissues indicate soft tissue
trauma. No evidence of increased signal within the spinal cord
to indicate cord edema or contusion.
