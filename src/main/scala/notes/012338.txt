Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
arterial line
central venous catheter

History of Present Illness:
43 yo male with end stage AIDS (CD4 count 4, with viral load
91,500) complicated by [**Doctor First Name **], CMV retinitis, HIV Cardiomyopathy
with CHF and EF 25%, Pneumocystis carinii PNA, Pseudomonal PNA,
admitted with respiratory distress and diarrhea. Pt went to his
primary care physician 4 days prior to admission and started on
empiric Pneumocystis carinii PNA treatment with
bactrim/steroids.  Pt felt good over weekend- working in garden
and then acutely worsened overnight.  Pt felt a lot worse today
complaining of SOB, crampy abdominal pain, and came to ED for
evaluation.  In ED, the patient had CXR which showed bilateral
patchy opacities and ABG was 7.20/22/105 but felt to be
relatively stable.  Pt was initially hypotensive but responded
to normal saline fluid boluses.  Pt found to have INR of 5.2 so
transferred to the Medical ICU (East).  Sepsis protocol was not
activated at that time.

Currently, pt complaining of SOB and breathing still very
labored.  +diarrhea, Fever & chills.  Mild abdominal pain.
Denies CP, N/V, urinary symptoms.

ECHO [**2188-9-24**] EF<25% Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2187-4-25**], left
ventricular systolic function appears slightly more depressed.
The right ventricle is now mildly dilated and free wall motion
may be more depressed.
.
CXR ([**9-23**]): IMPRESSION:  Rapid development of multifocal
parenchymal opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia
CXR ([**9-24**]- 2:30am): Multiple regions of consolidation have
progressed substantially consistent with bacterial pneumonia.
Interval increase in the heart size and mild pulmonary edema
suggest cardiac decompensation.  Stomach is markedly distended
with air.  There is no large pleural effusion, though a small
volume of right pleural fluid may be present.  No pneumothorax.
CXR ([**9-24**]- 7am): Two focal pulmonary consolidation has
progressed substantially consistent with worsening pneumonia.
There is a small component of pulmonary edema and new small
right pleural effusion.  ET tube and left subclavian line are in
standard placements.  No pneumothorax
CXR [**2188-9-28**] Endotracheal tube is 5 cm above carina. Left
subclavian CV line is in proximal SVC. NG tube is in stomach. No
pneumothorax. There are diffuse bilateral patchy pulmonary
opacities, unchanged since the prior film of [**2188-9-27**],
consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
CXR [**2188-10-1**] IMPRESSION: Persistent focal left lower lobe
opacity, as well as bilateral patchy alveolar densities. The
overall appearance is essentially unchanged.
NOTE: All subsequent CXR until pt's death on [**2188-10-12**] were
unchanged.  He had persistent bilateral patchy alveolar
densities, consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
.
CT ABD/PEL [**2188-10-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased consolidation seen in the visualized lung bases
with larger bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Increased anasarca and ascites.
3. Continuing evidence of colitis, with improvement in the
proximal colon, but more distally unchanged.
