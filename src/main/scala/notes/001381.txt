Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1603**] is a 69M who is s/p operative BiV/ICD placement c/b
hypotension and decreased urine output.  In particular, after
placement of BiV pacemaker/ICD, the patient developed
hypotension.  He was placed on Neosynephrine for a short period
of time and responded well with MAPs >65.  Initially the
differential of the hypotension included sepsis, cardiogenic
shock, tamponade, and dehydration.  However, 2 ECHO's did not
show evidence of tamponade, and the swan catheter did not
support cardiogenic shock.  The fever and elevated white count
was consistent with sepsis, especially in the setting of
presumed PNA and lung infiltration.  Zosyn and vanco were
started for presumed nosocomial infection or infection d/t
surgery.  BB, ACE, and lasix, and aldactone were initially held,
but losartan waw restarted and titrated up to home dose, and
[**Last Name (un) 61755**] was started and kept at 1/2 home dose.  Lasix IV was
subsequently used when patient demonstrated fluid overload,
improving the patient's breathing and clinical status.

After pacemaker/ICD placement on [**6-13**], the patient was started
on Vanc per recommendations of CSurg.  He was atrial-sensed and
v-paced.  On [**6-16**] he was found to be in a-fib and intermittent
VT. Initially the plan was to wait until [**6-17**] for DCCV and load
the patient with ibutilide and lidocaine and start him on amio
on [**6-16**].  However, the patient was hypotensive and concern there
was concern that was causing this hypotenion. The patient was
cardioverted on [**6-16**] and returned to sinus rhythm (V paced).

In regards to ID, the Pt spiked a fever to 101.8 post-op.
Pneumonia was considered as a cause of the fever and hypotension
for several reasons, including complicated OR course of
intubation and adjusting lung volumes as needed for placement of
leads of pacemaker, developing a new productive cough, and
having infiltrates on CXR.  Pt was started on vancomycin per
protocol of pacemaker placement and given dose of levofloxacin
in PACU for fever. However, in the CCU levo was changed to zosyn
due to concern for nocosomial infection and to avoid prolongued
QT interval, and this was continued until discharge.  Laboratory
data did not definitively confirm the source of infection, as
sputum cultures revealed only moderate growth of oropharyngeal
flora ([**6-17**], after antibiotics had already begun), urine
cultures were negative, and blood cultures did not demonstrate
growth.

In regards to his CHF and cardiac status, digoxin was held d/t
dig toxicity (level 1.3), while ASA and zocor were continued.
As hypotension improved metoprolol was added, as well as
losartan and coreg.  BP tolerated these medication additions
well

Patient has underlying diabetes and was placed on an insulin
sliding scale while in the hospital.  He also received SQ
heparin and protonix as prophylactic measures for DVT and
gastric bleed, respectively.  The patient remained full code
during this hospitalization.
