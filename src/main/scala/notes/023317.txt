Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 65499**] is a 49 year old female with a history of left L4-L5
microdiscectomy without complication.  She was seen at [**Hospital1 18**]
orthopedic spine clinic for her chief complaint of recurrent
left leg pain that radiates from her back.   While at [**Hospital1 18**] she
experienced a period of somnolence

1. Left leg pain- Mrs. [**Known lastname 65499**] underwent L3-Ll4, L4-L5, L5-S1
lumbar laminectomy, facetectomy and foraminotomy, bilateral
revision without fusion on [**2168-4-19**] without complications.
At this time her leg pain has resolved.

2.  Altered Mental Status- Likely multifactorial from hypoxia
and hypercarbia. Ddx also includes hypothyroidism as patient
already has another autoimmune condition: Addison's and less
likely from steroids themselves or from infection. Per notes,
she fell on her face, possibly in [**Month (only) 958**], so it is unlikely but
this could have unmasked a subdural hematoma, especialy as she
has a new anemia. Coags last checked in [**Month (only) 958**] and she had a
normal INR.  At that time she was transfered to SICU for closer
monitoring.  She was taken of her of narcotics, baclofen, and
neurontin and given naloxone to reverse narcotic effect.  This
did not change her status.  This period of altered mental status
resolved without complication.
