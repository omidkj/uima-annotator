Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2234**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
66 F c CAD/CHF, diabetes, hypertension, [**First Name3 (LF) 20440**] [**First Name3 (LF) 20441**],
schizoaffective disorder, who presents with shortness of breath.
The pt recalls that she started to have trouble breathing this
morning. it came on gradually and worsened slowly. It was
initally associated with non-radiating chest pain over her left
chest and sternum, which was pressure like, pleuritic and
positional as well as intermittent and resolved completed
already when "the paramedics started working on me". On further
questioning the patient reports shortness of breath already
overnight as well as 3-pillow orthopnea. She also recalls a more
pronounced LLE over the last three days. She denies any dietary
indiscretion, however reports sometimes eating salt, "but not
too much". She reports taking her medications diligently.
.
ROS: She reports intermittent fevers, ongoing for several months
as well as night sweats. She also has had about a 20lb weight
loss over the last months since her hospitalization. Also
positive for constipation for three months, mild "abdominal
cramping". Denies cough, diarrhea, blood in the stool or urine,
dysuria. No recent sedentary episodes but at baseline not very
mobile.
.
ED course: Pt arrived to the ED on BIPAP. VS 64 172/86 24 100%,
settings unknown. Pt had received Lasix iv by the paramedics.
Nitro gtt was started for BP control. The patient then was
titrated down to 100% facemask and continued to do well. CXR was
done and showed mild pulmonary edema. BNP was elevated at 5000.

PAST STUDIES:
Stress Mibi [**5-24**]:
No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. No reversible
myocardial perfusion defect is identified.
.
[**Month/Year (2) **]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers (however images suboptimal; cannot
exclude). There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is at least moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion.
.
Spirometry in [**2113**]:
mild restricitve pattern
.
CT chest [**9-26**]:
Interval increase in size of the dominant right upper lobe
pulmonary
nodule. The interval growth and CT morphology are highly
suspicious for malignancy. Although slightly below the size
threshold for reliability of PET imaging, PET-CT may still be
potentially helpful if it produces a positive result.  Other
options include short-term followup CT in 3 months or VATS
biopsy/resection.
2) Two other subpleural right upper and lower nodules are
stable.  Tiny lingular and left lower lobe nodules were
previously obscured by atelectasis on the study of [**2118-5-12**].
3) Stable, ectatic thoracic aorta.
.
CURRENT STUDIES:
.
[**9-28**] EKG: SR, HR 67, NA, NI, no ST/TW changes
.
[**2118-9-28**] CHEST XR (PORTABLE AP): There is vascular pedicles
engorgement. The pulmonary vessels are indistinct with mild
cephalization. These findings are consistent with hydrostatic
edema. There is a tortuous aorta. The cardiac silhouette is
enlarged. No definite blunting of the costophrenic angles is
seen to suggest large effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
Incidental note is made of cervical fusion plate. Since the
prior exam, the nasogastric tube has been removed. IMPRESSION:
Mild cardiogenic hydrostatic edema. Repeat radiography following
appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for underlying
infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old Female with CAD/CHF, diabetes, hypertension,
[**Month/Day/Year 20440**] [**Month/Day/Year 20441**],
schizoaffective disorder, and lung nodule who presents with
shortness of breath, most likely due to CHF with component of
mild COPD exacerbation.  The following issues were addressed on
this admission.
.
1. Hypoxia: likely due to CHF with component of mild COPD
exacerbation. MICU team's suspicion for PE was low given the
clinical context, no recent sedentary episodes, and no clinical
concern for DVT. However they did consider that she might be at
increased risk for coagulation as her recent CT findings were
suspicious for malignancy. Clinically and based on absence of
leukocytosis, they did not suspect infection.  Patient given
lasix by EMS and started on nitro drip in emergency room. Over
the first night of admission in the ICU the patient was weaned
from BIPAP to 3L nasal cannula. She continued to diurese from
the lasix administered by EMT. Repeat CXR in the morning showed
minimal change in pulmonary edema. Nitro drip was weaned over
first night of admission, transitioned to oral nitrates. The
patient was placed on daily lasix, 40mg daily, and continued to
diurese.  She was transferred to the floor on the evening of
[**9-29**].  By [**9-30**] she was satting in the high 90's on room air. By
[**10-1**] she was satting mid 90's with ambulation on room air.
Felt secondary to heart failure and possibly underlying COPD.
See below.
.
2. Heart Failure, diastolic: no clear precipitating factor for
exacerbation, however most likely dietary indiscretion and
possibly hypertension.   EKG unremarkable and cardiac enzymes
were negative times 3. TSH was checked given history of
thyroiditis and was normal. Florinef was held, as it could
contribute to CHF sympt
