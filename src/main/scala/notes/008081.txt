Imaging:

[**2186-10-11**] Hip 1 view
There has been placement of a left total hip prosthesis with
noncemented acetabular component fixed with two screws and a
noncemented femoral stem. Gas is seen in the soft tissues. No
immediate hardware-related complication is seen. Please refer to
operative report for full details

EKG [**10-11**] Sinus rhythm. Intraventricular conduction delay. Left
axis deviation. Low QRS voltage in the precordial leads.
Compared to prior tracing of [**2186-10-4**] there is now low QRS
voltage in the precordial leads and the rate has increased.

Portable CXR [**2186-10-12**]
There has been interval extubation. ICD remains in standard
position. Heart is enlarged, but there is no evidence of
pulmonary edema. Lungs are clear.

[**2186-10-17**] TTE: Conclusions - The left atrium is elongated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
severely dilated. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with akinesis of mid to apical segments
and hypokinesis of the basal segments. Transmitral Doppler
imaging is consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2184-8-17**], the left ventricule is more dilated
with increased mitral regurgitation severity and severe systolic
and diastolic dysfunction.

[**2186-10-22**] CT Chest/ABD/Pelvis - FINDINGS: Exophytic right thyroid
nodule, posteroinferiorly, approximately 1cm. AICD is seen in
the left chest wall with subcutaneous tissues, with continuous
lead to the heart. There is curvilinear calcification seen along
the left vintricular apex, compatible with previous infarct and
possible ventricular aneurysm. The heart is enlarged, no
pericardial effusion. Small pleural effusions and dependent
atelectasis is seen. There is a single 7-mm nodule in the right
upper lobe, series 2, image 18, as well as a smaller RML
granuloma. No focal consolidative airspace disease or pneumonia
identified. No significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There are dense coronary artery calcifications. Bilateral
gynecomastia. Small calcification/loose body within right
gleno-humeral joint.
ABDOMEN: Liver and spleen are within normal limits. There is a
large amount of peripancreatic edema and stranding throughout
the mesentery of the lesser sac extending to the retroperitoneum
and left paracolic gutter, along which the fluid tracks to the
iliac fossa and anterior left hemipelvis. The pancreas remains
well perfused without definite necrotic areas. There is
attenuation of the splenic vein, which is markedly narrowed
through the midline, but does remain patent. No pancreatic
ductal dilatation. Gallbladder is present with a single large
stone seen near the gallbladder neck, measuring 1.5 cm. No
intrahepatic biliary dilatation is seen. The adrenal glands are
prominent with a more focal 1.5 cm nodular density along the
lateral limb of the left adrenal gland, which likely represents
a benign adenoma; however, this is indeterminate on a single
phase examination.
PELVIS: The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically.
Subcentimeter renal hypodensities likely represent cysts, but
are too small to thoroughly characterize. There is
atherosclerotic calcification within a normally sized aorta. The
right iliac artery is slightly ectatic. Small bowel loops are
unremarkable. Within the deep pelvis, there is a segment of
focal bowel wall thickening involving the sigmoid as it crosses
the midline, measuring approximately 12 cm, with some mild
surrounding stranding. This focal colitis is likely infectious
or inflammatory in etiology or possibly ischemic, or it may be a
sequela of the aforementioned pancreatitis, as the fluid from
the lesser sac does track into the pelvis and terminate in the
region of this focally inflamed segment of bowel. There is no
evidence for obstruction. No definite mass lesion is identified.
There is inflammation in the subcutaneous tissues surrounding
the left hip, in keeping with recent total left hip replacement.
Hardware is intact without evidence for complication. No
periacetabular fluid collection is seen.
Review of bone windows demonstrates no suspicious abnormalities.
Degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine, and facet
joints.
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive pancreatitis, with peripancreatic and
retroperitoneal edema and stranding as well as attenuation of
the splenic vein, but no necrosis or pseudocyst.
2. Short segment of focal sigmoid colitis; infectious, ischemic
or inflammatory in etiology. Although unlikely neoplastic in
etiology, a followup colonoscopy upon resolution of symptoms is
advised to rule out an underlying malignancy.
3. Incidental 1.5 cm left adrenal nodule, likely adenoma.
Non-contrast CT evaluation advised on a nonemergent basis is
recommended to verify benignity.
4. Small
