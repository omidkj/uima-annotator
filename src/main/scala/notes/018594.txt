STUDIES:
CT Neck with Contrast, [**2121-5-12**]:
Artifact from the dental amalgam degrades the images, within
these limitations there is a 20 x 15 mm enhancing inflammatory
mass below is angle of left mandible may be related to

nodes are seen.

approx 0.5cm clear watery cyst, posterior pharyngeal [**Name6 (MD) **] in NP
with 0.5cm mass with overlying granular muscosa in midline,
Larynx - valleculae clear, crisp epiglottis, patent piriforms
bil, crisp vocal folds with good mobility.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Left Facial Swelling:  The patient presented with left
submandibular gland infection and large [**Location (un) 21511**] duct stone.
The patient was at risk for Ludwig's angina given rate of
progression of infection (over 1 day) and given that infection
already involves left submandibular space, and sublingual space.
 Had been seen by ENT in ED, without evidence of airway
compromise.  No evidence of laryngal swelling on scope.  She
received antibiotics in ED and one time dose of dexamethasone.
She continued on vanc/unasyn while gland cultures were sent.
These returned with finding of mixed flora and [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
She was discharged on Augmentin and Fluconazole. ENT also
recommended [**Doctor Last Name 21512**] wedges QID and salivary massage QID to help
stimulate secretions. She was also discharged on Prednisone.

# Anti-phospholipid syndrome (APLS): The patient has a history
of PE and renal vein thromosis, managed on coumadin as
outpatient.  Her INR remained therapeutic on this admission.

# Lupus: The patient has a history of Lupus managed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  No evidence of acute flare.  No reason to suspect any
correlation with other autoimmune process like Sojourn's. She
continued hydrochlorquine but held cellcept in setting of
infection. She was discharged on Prednisone rather than Cellcept
until follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1667**].

#  Glomerularnephritis:  This had significantly improved on
cellcept.  Grade 3 membranous glomerularnephritis with Cr at
baseline at 1.1. She was continued on hydrochloroquine and
lisinopril. Cellcept was held in setting of infection and was
discharged on Prednisone. She will likely resume Cellcept to be
decided at follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1667**].

#  Depression: She was continued on Prozac.
