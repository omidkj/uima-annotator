Admission Date:  [**2155-1-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2155-1-15**]


Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Respiratory failure.
2.  Hypotension.
3.  Cellulitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old
female admitted [**2155-1-3**], from [**Hospital3 9266**] after a recent discharge from [**Hospital1 346**] for cellulitis admitted with acute
respiratory distress complicated by hypotension.  The patient
was intubated in the Emergency Department and placed on
pressors which was complicated by a ventricular tachycardia
arrest likely secondary to Dopamine.

The patient had ST depressions on her EKG at the time, ruled
out for myocardial infarction, but echocardiogram at that
time showed an ejection fraction of 15%.  She was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit with issues of Gram negative
rods in the sputum with a pneumonia on her chest x-ray, yeast
in her urine which was never treated.  Pulmonary shows
bilateral pleural effusions, pneumonia, and a mostly
unexplained high degree of hypoxia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Vascular dementia history.
2.  Transient ischemic attack.
3.  History of osteoarthritis.
4.  Glaucoma.
5.  Cellulitis.
6.  Knee surgery.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Oxazepam 2.5 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Dicloxacillin 500 mg p.o. four times a day.
6.  Timolol eye drops.
7.  Multivitamin, Vitamin C.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   She is a resident of the [**Hospital3 1761**].  No alcohol, no tobacco.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On initial physical examination, the
temperature is 103.2 F.; heart rate 80; blood pressure
122/70; respiratory rate 16; O2 saturation 90%.  In general,
she is a cachectic female, frail appearing.  HEENT:  Pupils
were nonreactive.  Mucous membranes were dry.  Neck supple,
no lymphadenopathy.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm with
III/VI harsh systolic murmur, loudest at the left lower
sternal border.  Lungs were coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Extremities showed left lower extremity discolored and warm
with desquamation to upper shin.  No frank ulcerations, no
edema.  One plus pedal pulses.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 7.1,
hematocrit 40, platelets 420.  Chem-7 was within normal
limits.

EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a left axis.  No acute
ST-T changes.  Decreased voltage in the inferolateral leads.
T waves flatter in the lateral lead.

Chest x-ray after intubation showed expansion of the left
lower lobe with endotracheal tube 3 to 4 centimeters above
the carina.  Increased pulmonary vascular congestion.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was admitted with ST
depressions in V4 and V5 with a slight troponin leak, likely
attributed to demand ischemia in the setting of low blood
pressure.  She had no intervention and was continued on
aspirin.

PUMP - The patient with an ejection fraction of 15% with two
plus mitral regurgitation and two plus tricuspid
regurgitation, slightly congestive heart failure on chest
x-ray.  She was diuresed some in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit and was called out and was not diuresed any further.
Intravenous were continued secondary to hypoxia.

RHYTHM:  The patient with ventricular tachycardia arrest and
status post DC cardioversion in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, was now stable in atrial fibrillation.  Did have one
episode of ventricular tachycardia on the floor which
resolved with administration of Lopressor.  The patient was
continued on Telemetry.

2.  PULMONARY:  The patient with hypoxia likely secondary to
pneumonia and left lower lobe atelectasis, and large
bilateral pleural effusions.  The patient never had a
pulmonary embolism work-up, however, the family opted for
non-aggressive measures.

3.  PNEUMONIA: The patient had gram negative rods, likely
stems from pneumonia and Enterobacter.  The Enterobacter is
pan sensitive.  The patient was on Ceptaz for the gram
negative rod effusions, bilateral layering and opted not to
tap.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient with an episode of coffee
ground emesis with stable hematocrits.  No further
intervention was taken on this.

5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Pneumonia as above.  Urinary tract
infection with yeast; unclear is this is infection on
positive urinalysis.  Was never treated with Diflucan.

6.  INTEGUMENT:  Was continued on antibiotics for cellulitis.

The patient was on the floor in respiratory distress since
she was called out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit and on
the 28th, it was decided to make the patient COMFORT MEASURES
ONLY.

On the morning of [**1-15**], the patient was found
unresponsive to voice and pain without carotid pulses or
heart sounds.

Time of Death was 07:55 a.m.  Attending, primary care
physician and family were notified and no postmortem
examination was requested.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pneumonia.
2.  Cellulitis.
3.  Respiratory failure.
4.  Hypotension.
5.  Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
6.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed.
7.  Ventricular tachycardia arrest.
8.  Congestive heart failure.
9.  Urinary tract infection.
10. Hypoxia.
