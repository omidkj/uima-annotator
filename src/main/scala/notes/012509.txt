HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 87-year-old female
with congestive heart failure exacerbation.

The patient is an 87-year-old female with the past medical
history for congestive heart failure, coronary artery
disease, status post catheterization in [**2117**], hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  She presents to the emergency department with
shortness of breath progressively worsening over the past few
months, accompanied with dizziness.  In addition, she
complains of cough, sometimes productive of clear sputum,
fever, chills at home.  She denies chest pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.

She reports taking all her medications as she does not
forget.  However, she does not use a pill box and has no VNA.
She does admit to occasionally eating salty meals including
canned soup and "I love my bacon."  She reports that her
exercise tolerance is low, becoming short of breath after one
to two blocks of walking.  She sleeps with two pillows at
night.

Her reported complaint of dizziness has been documented in
OMR as possible BPV.

In the emergency department, she received IV Lasix 80 mg
times one and put out 800 cc of urine, plus 200 cc on the
floor.

10. Senna.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  No VNA, no alcohol
use.  He quit smoking 15 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 94.4, heart
rate 60, respiration 24, blood pressure 159/76, oxygen
saturation 95% on 2 liter nasal cannula, 85% on room air.
GENERAL:  The patient was in no acute distress, somewhat
uncomfortable in bed.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic
head.  PERRLA, EOMI, moist mucous membranes.  CARDIOVASCULAR:
Very distant sounds, regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and
S2.  LUNGS:  Distant breath sounds, slight rales at the bases
bilaterally.  Faint and expiratory wheezing, no rhonchi.
ABDOMEN:  Obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive
bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  2+ to 3+ pitting, lower
extremities bilaterally.  NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient was
alert and oriented times three.  Input and outputs 120 in,
1000 out.  Weight 263.9 pounds.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory revealed the following:  WBC
9.7, hematocrit 37.4, PLTS 37.  Chem 7:  Sodium of 140,
potassium 4.4, CO2 102, bicarbonate 31, BUN 26, creatinine
1.1, and glucose 105; urinalysis yellow, clear, negative
nitrite, and LE, 0 to 2 white blood cells, 0 bacteria, 0 to 2
epithelial cells.

Chest x-ray revealed mild pleural effusions and interstitial
edema consistent with congestive heart failure and no focal
infiltrates.  The EKG revealed sinus bradycardia at 50 beats
per minute, left atrial abnormality, and no acute ST changes
compared to [**2117-7-30**], no significant changes except sinus
bradycardia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 87-year-old female with a
history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease with likely congestive heart failure
exacerbation, secondary to possibly medication noncompliance,
as well as poor diet high in salt.  While on the medical
floor, the patient was diuresed with good urine output.  The
patient was also ruled out for myocardial infarction times
three negative CKs.

On hospital day #2, overnight, she became acutely delirious
and remained somewhat waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] in mental status
throughout that day.

On hospital day #3, she was noted to desaturate, as well as
in delirium and noted to have respiratory acidosis on ABG.
Chest x-ray was obtained, which was unchanged.  The patient
eventually needed intubation on the floor and was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  The patient's respiratory failure
was felt to be multifactorial.  During the five day stay in
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient's respiratory acidosis was compensated
and eventually the patient was extubated on [**2119-2-13**]
successfully.  The patient was then transferred back to the
medical floor in stable respiratory condition.

The patient's most recent ABG revealed the compensated
respiratory acidosis and on stable oxygenation with one liter
of nasal cannula the goal oxygen saturation was 88%to 91%
because the patient is a CO2 retainer.  Caution when using
oxygen.  The patient was started on steroid taper while in
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and steroid taper was started.  The patient
continued on her MDIs Flovent and Combivent while in the
hospital.  A five-ay course of Azithromycin was completed
while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  The patient will complete a 14-day course
of Levaquin for presumed pneumonia.

Chest x-ray was obtained on [**2-13**], which revealed bibasilar
atelectasis versus consolidation with bilateral pleural
effusions.  Chest CT was obtained on [**2-11**], which showed small
moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
atelectasis versus consolidation.  There is also a small
pulmonary nodule in the right upper lung, most likely benign
in nature.

The patient does have a history of
....................congestive heart failure and
echocardiogram was obtained on [**2-10**], which revealed 2+ MR, 2+
TR and normal left ventricular function with an EF of greater
than 55%.  The patient was restarted on her p.o. dose of
Lasix at 60 mg p.o.q.d. after transfer to the floor from the
unit.

The patient's mental status had changed one day prior to
transfer to the unit in a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] fashion.  The
patient has been known to sundown in the past.  Head CT was
obtained on [**2-9**], which revealed no acute bleed or stroke and
possible old infarct in the left occipital lobe.  After
transfer out of the unit on [**2-14**] the patient's mental status
was alert and oriented times three, however, again,
overnight, she was somewhat delirious into the next day in a
waxing-and-[**Doctor Last Name 688**] fashion.  A psychiatric consultation was
obtained while in the hospital.

The Department of Physical Therapy recommended that the
patient receive [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation.
