Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
This is an 88 y/o male with multiple medical problems who was
recently hospitalized for a fall from [**2188-2-23**] to [**2188-4-2**].   The
patient was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.  During this time the
patient's family feels that his course has been deteriorating.
Leading up to this presentation he was noted to be delirious
this week.  He became hypoxic today desatting down to 77% RA
and tachypneic to the 40s.  ABG 7.42/65/64/42.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further mgt.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, the patient's vitals were as follows T
98, P76, BP 111/54, RR 17, 02 sat 100% on NRB.  There was later
concern that the patient had a weak gag reflex.  He was
intubated to protect his airway.  Patient became transiently
hypotensive with sedation which later improved with fluid
boluses.
.
CXR showed parenchymal and reticular opacities c/w aspiration
(seen on previous).  Head CT was negative.  The patient was
transferred to the unit for further management.
.
In terms of his recent hospitalization, the patient's course was
complicated.  He originally presented with a fall during which
time he was noted to have minimally displaced anterior column
acetabular fractures with nondisplaced inferior pubic rami
fractures.  These fractures were deemed stable by orthopedics.
Due to his poor nutritional status, PEG tube was placed.  During
the EGD the patient was noted to have duodenal crater ulcers
which were cauterized.  He was later bacteremic with Klebsiella
ESBL, treated with Meropenem.  The patient was also treated for
aspiration pneumonia.  He was initially started on levaquin and
flagyll but later transitioned to zosyn.  The patient was also
kept on strict aspiration precautions.
The patient had a prolong complicated course which later
stabilized.  He was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.

Imaging
[**3-/2109**] CXR
COMPARISON: Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2188-3-27**].
FINDINGS: Extensive reticular nodular interstitial opacities
along with more nodular opacities are noted again predominantly
in the left upper lobe and to a lesser degree in the right upper
lobe and left perihilar regions. Lung volumes are markedly
diminished reducing the evaluation of the lung bases. The right
upper extremity PICC line has been replaced with a left upper
extremity- approach PICC line with the distal tip at the
superior cavoatrial junction. Again noted are clips and median
sternotomy wires consistent with prior CABG. No definite
effusion or pneumothorax is evident. Consistent with the given
history, an endotracheal tube is evident with the distal tip
approximately 6.2 cm from the carina.
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube as above. New left upper extremity
PICC line. Extensive parenchymal reticular and nodular opacities
previously ascribed to aspiration pneumonia. Given their
persistence, a non-emergent chest CT is recommended to assess
for interval change.
.
[**3-/2109**] CT head
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles, cisterns,
and sulci are enlarged, unchanged in appearance. Extensive
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities as
well as multiple lacunar infarcts are redemonstrated. The
visualized paranasal sinus is clear aside from mild ethmoid
sinus mucus thickening, and the mastoid air cells are clear.
Note of bilateral lens replacements.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
[**3-/2109**] EKG
Sinus arrhythmia. Left atrial abnormality. Right bundle-branch
block. Left
anterior fascicular block. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2188-3-26**] no
diagnostic interim change.
.
[**4-12**] CTA chest
1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism.
2. Slight decrease in the scattered consolidations/ground-glass
opacities predominantly seen in the dependent most portion of
both lungs associated with mild bronchiectasis and impacted
bronchioles. The appearances although slightly decreased on
today's examination suggest a chronic process like aspiration
3.Retained secretion are seen in the carinal
bifurcation.Bronchoscopy is recommended.
3. The previously noted pleural effusions have resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pneumonia
The patient's respiratory failure was thought to be due to an
aspiration pneumonia. CTA chest showed no evidence of PE, and
cardiac enzymes showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia.
Sputum grew MRSA and GNRs, the speciation of which was pending
at discharge and should be followed up by his physicians at his
rehabilitation facility. He was started empirically on
vancomycin and zosyn, which he will continue pending return of
the final culture data. He should complete a 14day course of
therapy to end on [**2188-4-25**].
.
2. C. difficile colitis
Patient's stool came back positive for C. diff toxin, was
started on flagyl. He should continue flagyl and continue for an
additional 2 weeks following completion of meropenem and
vancomycin to reduce risk of recurrence. Patient was afebrile
with minimal abdominal tenderness and no leukocytosis at
discharge.
.
3. History of delirium: Per patient's family leading up to his
admission he appeared confused.  During his last admission, he
was found to have a PCA infarct.  An EEG during the last
admission also showed encephalopathy.

A family meeting was held and the patient's code status was
changed to DNR/DNI.
