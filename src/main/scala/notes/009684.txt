Brief Hospital Course:
Presented with baseline Cr of 1.6-1.8 . Worsening renal failure
made him more resistant to his diuretics, leading to
re-accumulation of his ascites. - Abdominal U/S showed
moderate-to-large amount of ascites. There was no evidence of
SBP on tap. Patient was encephalopathic at baseline and he
continued on Lactulose and rifaximin. Urine cx + for e coli
completed 7 days of cipro on [**2-24**].
He started on HD and c/o CP when on dialysis. EKG without
significant ST-T changes. Underwent persantine MIBI which did
not show any e/o ischemia, no [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] abnormality was noted.
Tube feeds were given. He experienced hyperglycemia and insulin
was adjusted by [**Last Name (un) **].

On [**3-8**] he was taken to the OR by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **]
[**Doctor Last Name **] for liver and kidney transplant from a 16 y.o. brain dead
donor involved in MVC. Of note, he is HIT + therefore, heparin
was not used. The portal vein was found to be small but
otherwise normal in appearance. The liver was reperfused after
the portal vein had been freed of any clot but reperfused
somewhat sluggishly. After the arterial anastomosis, the liver
pinked up appropriately. Please see OP report for further
details. Two [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains were placed; The medial drain under
the biliary anastomosis and the lateral drain at the
suprahepatic cava. A JP drain was placed near the renal
transplant.

On POD 1,fluid boluses, blood products and albumin were given
for hypotension. He was extubated. On [**3-9**] he spiked a temp to
102.2. He was coughing and raising thick yellow sputum. There
was concern for aspiration pneumonia. WBC was 4.1.  A CXR
revealed LLL collapse.  Nebs were given. O2 sats were in high
90's and abg's were good. Periop IV vanco and levo were
continued and flagyl was added. An insulin gtt was initially
used for hyperglycemia then glargine was started. Glucoses
improved. A U/A had rbc>50, wbc 20-50 and no epi's. A urine cx
subsequently was positive for 10-100,000 col of E.coli. Flagyl
and levo were changed to meropenum. Meropenum was given for a 7
day course.

On POD 2 he appeared tremulous, confused and at times appeared
to be hallucinating. An U/S revealed normal Doppler evaluation
of transplanted liver, but the left hepatic vein was not
assessed. Creatinine and LFTs trended down. He was started on
prograf. On [**3-11**] a head CT was done for confusion and tremors.
This showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Neurology was consulted and recommended toxic metabolic and
infectious workup including an MRI as well as avoidance of
dopamine blocking agents. MRI was not done due to significant
tremors.  There was concern for leukoencephalopathy from prograf
although prograf levels were low at 4.9.  The left femoral HD
line was removed. A post pyloric feeding tube was inserted and
feedings were initially held given concern for aspiration. Lasix
was given for volume excess with good response. Creat decreased
to 1.6
