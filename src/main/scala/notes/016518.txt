History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 11182**] is a 53 yo woman with HIV (? not taking HAART, WBC
of 1.3 with 17% bands, last CD4 of 274 [**7-9**] from [**Hospital1 2177**]), CHF,
mitral regurgitation, AVNRT, HTN, HepC, Asthma/COPD (on 4L home
O2, still smoking), [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 106114**] pneumonitis, ESRD
on HD, who was transferred on day of admission from dialysis
with chills, malaise and mild SOB near the end of her HD
session. Two days before admission, toward the end of her
dialysis session, the patient felt like the inside of her body
was on fire. The pain was not localized, was described as [**11-11**]
burning, and lasted about five minutes. Thereafter, she felt
cold and had chills, and described being lightheaded and that
her blood pressure dropped. She noted a ringing in her ears when
her blood pressure dropped. She was then transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED. Patient reports USOH prior to HD. She denied recent
increase in her chronic dry cough. Denied dysuria. Denied
headache, neck stiffness. In terms of her SOB, she did not feel
it is far from her baseline, and it was worse when she was
receiving HD.
.
In the ED, the patient had blood cultures drawn and was admitted
to the MICU for respiratory distress. Her vital signs in the ED
were 101.2, 111, 120-130 systolic, 96% on 2L (up to 15L NRB due
to poor pleth). On exam, they reported increased WOB, SOB,
difficulty completing sentences.
.
She received methylprednisolone 125 IV, 3 Combivent nebs,
aspirin 325, vancomycin 1 gram, ceftazadime 1 gram,
acetaminophen and 1 L NS. She was also given enoxaparin 60
subcutaneously.
.
She denied any recent weight loss, diarrhea, vomiting, or change
in appetite.  On transfer to CC7, she felt much better and had
no complaints, except for a number of itchy skin spots
distributed throughout her body. This had been evaluated prior
to this admission. Her WBC was 7.8 with 13% bands.

([**2111-8-4**]) CHEST X-RAY:
Bedside AP examination labeled "upright at 8:35" is compared
with two views dated [**2111-5-8**]. There is cardiomegaly with rounded
LV enlargement and thoracic aortic tortuosity, as before. There
is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pleural effusion. Linear
scarring involving the left more than right lung base is
unchanged over the series of recent studies, with no new
airspace process. There is stable prominence of the central
pulmonary arteries which may reflect underlying pulmonary
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly this is a 53 yo Female with HIV (?off HAART wbc of 1.3,
last CD4 of 217 [**12-8**]), CHF, AVNRT, HTN, HepC, Asthma/COPD (on
4L home O2, still smoking), LIP, ESRD on HD, who was transferred
on day of admission from dialysis with chills, SOB [**2-3**] way
through HD.
.
1. Respiratory distress: Patient with significant baseline
pulmonary disfunction secondary to asthma/COPD, LIP, CHF on home
O2 and still smoking who presented with acute SOB in addition to
chronic SOB/DOE. CXR was negative for acute pulmonary edema or
focal consolidation. Pt received enoxaparin, methylprednisolone,
vancomycin and ceftazadime in the ED. Upon arrival, no evidence
of acute respiratory distress. Pt was satting 100% on 4LNC (home
level). On the floor, the patient had no symptoms of respiratory
distress, and was satting 93-97 on room air. She only became
short of breath upon exertion.
.
# ID: Patient presented with fever, leukopenia, and bandemia.
Because the patient is immunocompromised and at risk for
infections, blood and urine cultures were obtained as she was
covered empirically with vancomycin and ceftazadime. Gentamicin
was then started, and ceftazadime and vancomycin were
discontinued. She was afebrile with a white count of 7.8 on the
floor. The empiric treatment in the ED may have had an effect.
Per ID consult recommendations, gentamicin was discontinued.
During her course, her bandemia resolved, and her white count
continued to fall. She had no fevers, chills, nausea, or
vomiting. There was never any growth from any of her cultures.
.
# HIV: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]/[**Doctor Last Name 4888**].  ID was consultd,
recommended continuing pt on her prior HAART regimen (abacavir,
nevirapine, ddI) despite possibly not being adherent to these
meds, the theory being that these medications would suppress her
wildtype virus and allow for genotyping of likely mutations at
her outpatient clinic. We
