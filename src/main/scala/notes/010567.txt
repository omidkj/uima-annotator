Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Penicillins / Clarithromycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
R sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Sinus surgery


History of Present Illness:
39F with a history of AIDS (CD4 113 [**2-25**], VL 109), Hep B,
pancreatitis, candidiasis, HSV, pyelonephritis, gonorrhea,
syphilis and cocaine abuse who presents with acute right sided
weakness for one day. Per report (compiled from the patient, her
group home, and mother), the patient yesterday complained of R
leg numbness/weakness and a mild headache. She lay down and felt
better but awoke at ~4am with an inability to ambulate [**12-20**] R leg
weakness and slurred speech. Her group home became concerned and
called EMS at this time. Of note, the patient reports
intermittant R leg numbness over the past several months but the
mother has noticed her daughter complain of bilateral LE
symptoms for >1yr. Over the past week, the patient denies any
fevers/chills/night sweats, N/V, abdominal pain, rash, cough,
weight loss, SOB, medication non-compliance, diarrhea, or
obvious sick contacts. She does endorse some mild pressure type
non-radiating chest pain in the ED today along with palpatations
that had since resolved.
.
In the ED, the patient was noted to have a variable mental
status and exam. They observed discordant neurologic exam
findings on the R compared to the L and a code stroke was
called. CT scan showed marked destruction of her sinuses c/w old
surgical procedures but infectious cause could not be excluded.
No recent infarcts were seen on this scan. Neurology evaluated
the patient and felt her picture was more consistent with an
infectious etiology but suggested an acute MRI to exclude CVA.
ENT was consulted who felt the CT was suggestive of an acute vs
chronic sinusitis but noted that this was unlikely to cause her
neurologic symptoms. Her telemetry showed a NSR with
intermittant runs of a rate related LBBB that had been seen
previously in [**7-23**]. She was admitted to the medicine service for
further work-up.
.
On the floor, her exam was significant for a ? of R sided
neglect and marked R sided UE/LE weakness. Her history was
occassionally inconsistent but was mostly c/w the history noted
above. She received her MRI soon after reaching the floor which
showed multiple acute infarctions present within the left
frontal lobe and another
within the right amygdala that were thought to be c/w either
embolic or watershed strokes.
.


Past Medical History:
AIDS (CD4 113 [**2-25**], VL 109)
Hep B
pancreatitis
candidiasis
HSV
pyelonephritis

Social History:
Significant drug use (most recently crack cocaine) but clean for
>4mo per her program. Remote IVDU but denies ETOH abuse. 1 PPD
smoker for 20 years, says she recently stopped. Currently living
at a substance abuse program (UMMIS). Has two children aged 19
and 13 who are in [**Doctor Last Name **] care.

Family History:
Noncontributory


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the medicine service and transferred
to neurology upon discovery of stroke. TEE showed no
vegetations, no asd/vsd and a bubble study was
negative.

ID was consulted regarding sinusitis and recommended broadening
her coverage for sinusitis from antibiotics to include
antifungals and they recommended tissue biopsy/debridement.
Neurosurgery was also consulted, who recommended repeat MRI/MRA,
as the first study was degraded by motion.

This showed "Similar to the previous examination, there is a
soft
tissue mass that destroys the sphenoid sinus. Following the
administration of intravenous gadolinium, there is diffuse
enhancement of this invasive mass.  Enhancement appears to
extend
along the wall of the left maxillary sinus.  The soft
tissues of the nasal sinuses also diffusely enhance.
Enhancement
extends into the cavernous sinus bilaterally. Multiple areas of
abnormal signal intensity within the cerebral hemispheres are
consistent with subacute infarction.  The
largest of these areas is located in the left parietal lobe and
measures approximately 3.2 x 3.5 cm.  An area of hyperintensity
within the left frontal lobe is much more pronounced on today's
examination compared to the exam from [**2116-3-11**].  The areas of
infarction within the left frontoparietal lobe superiorly also
appear more extensive compared to the previous examination.
The abnormal hyperintense signal within the right temporal lobe
is unchanged.

MRA:  Time-of-flight imaging demonstrates no flow within the
carotid arteries intracranially, again similar to the findings
from [**2116-3-11**]."

The risk of ENT surgery was discussed with the family, who
decided to proceed. This was performed, with precautions to keep
HOB flat, maintain good hydration with IVF, and keep sbp>160 and
avoiding sharp drops in blood pressure in the postoperative
period.

On [**3-13**], the patient underwent CT-guided bilateral sphenoid
sinus
surgical endoscopy with biopsy. Postoperatively, she was
admitted
to the SICU for further care.

On [**3-15**], head CT was performed for decreased responsivenss. It
showed "Very large right MCA and ACA infarct continues to evolve
with enlarging mass effect and shift of the median midline
structures, subfalcine herniation now 10 mm across the midline,
previously 5 with associated effacement of the lateral
ventricle.
The suprasellar cistern is also effaced with deviate asymmetry
of
the quadrigemminal plate cistern secondary to
transtentorial herniation that has also worsened in the
interval.
There is also effacement of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation
along the left MCA and ACA territory secondary to infarct though
to a much lesser involvement. New hypodensity in the right
cerebral peduncle is also suspicious for ischemia" and the
patient was started on mannitol.

On [**3-15**], she was started on neosynephrine to keep her MAP>90.
She
spiked overnight to [**3-16**] and was started on a cooling blanket.

During the day of [**3-16**], the patient's pupils ceased to be
reactive and an emergent head CT was obtained. it showed
worsening herniation and neurosurgery was again consulted. Upon
discussion with the family, surgical intervention was deemed
futile. Later that day, after extensive discussion, the patient
was made DNR and the decision was made to initiate comfort
measures only and the patient expired.
