Service: Medicine
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51 year old
male with a smoking history and COPD who was recently
diagnosed with squamous cell cancer in the right main stem
bronchus, status post mediastinoscopy and bronchoscopy
performed on [**2125-10-29**].  He initially was doing quite
developed a productive cough without hemoptysis, increasing
shortness of breath, no fever or chills.  Patient denied
nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.

On [**2125-10-31**], patient had markedly increased
shortness of breath with midsternal chest pain.  Patient went
to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital and in the emergency room an ABG
was below the 50s.  Patient was intubated and started on
gatifloxacin for questionable post obstructive pneumonia.
Patient also received Lasix for diuresis.  Patient was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2125-11-1**], for rigid bronchoscopy and right main stem
stenting.  Patient was accepted to the MICU.

Of note, bronchoscopy on [**2125-10-29**], showed a large
endobronchial lesion at the right main stem takeoff with
almost complete occlusion of the bronchus.  Biopsies were
sent which showed squamous cell carcinoma.  Mediastinoscopy
showed dense fibrous reaction in the anterior aspect of the
trachea.  There was question of lymph node versus mass
distension.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Squamous cell lung cancer.
3.  Chronic lower back pain.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Gatifloxacin and Flagyl.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives with wife.  Smokes
approximately [**11-22**] pack per day of cigarettes.  Patient drinks
approximately six beers every other day.  He is unemployed.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, patient was intubated and
sedated.  Temperature 98.8, heart rate 65, blood pressure
105/57, oxygen saturation 97% with vent setting at AC tidal
volume 500, respirations 16, PEEP 7.5, FIO2 0.6.  HEENT
pupils equal and reactive.  Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs had diffuse rhonchi and wheezes.  Cardiovascular
distant heart sounds, normal S1, S2 without murmurs.  Abdomen
soft, absent bowel sounds, no masses.  Extremities no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 27.1, hematocrit 29.8,
platelets 603.  PT 14.1, INR 1.3, PTT 32.1.  Lactate 1.4.
Sodium 136, potassium 4.7, chloride 98, bicarbonate 24, BUN
31, creatinine 0.9, glucose 121.  LFTs were remarkable for
LDH of 494.  Phosphorus was 5.2.  Chest x-ray right upper
lobe collapse with hyperlucency of the right middle lobe and
right lower lobe.  Small right pleural effusion.  Left lung
with diffuse haziness.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary.  The patient was admitted to the MICU and
intubated and sedated.  Patient underwent bronchoscopy and
stenting of the right main stem bronchus on [**2125-11-2**].  Bronchoscopy showed near complete obstruction of the
right main stem bronchus with lobulated tumor tissue.  Right
upper lobe bronchus was completely obstructed with tumor
mass.  Right middle lobe and right lower lobe bronchi were
patent with no tumor tissue.  Tumor in the right main stem
bronchus was destructed with electrocautery.  Further tissue
was removed with the rigid flexible bronchoscope.

Patient was extubated on [**2125-11-3**], status post
stenting.  Patient was placed on a brief prednisone taper for
questionable COPD inflammation secondary to the tumor.
Patient was also continued on levofloxacin and Flagyl for
post obstructive pneumonia.  Patient's oxygenation remained
stable during his hospital stay.  Patient was transferred out
of the MICU on [**2125-11-4**].  Patient was continued on
albuterol and Atrovent MDI and nebulizer for diffuse
wheezing.  Patient was able to ambulate with oxygen
saturation of 92%.  Patient was weaned from oxygen completely
on [**2125-11-5**].

2.  Cardiovascular.  The patient was noted to have a
bradycardic episode into the 40s post bronchoscopy and stent
placement.  EKG showed sinus rhythm at 45 beats per minute
with QTc of [**Street Address(2) 34642**] elevations.  Troponin was found to
be elevated at 3.2 with normal CKs.  It was thought that this
elevated troponin was secondary to stress from the procedure.
Patient was placed on aspirin and beta blocker.  An echo was
obtained on [**2125-11-2**], which showed an ejection
fraction of 55% to 60% with trivial mitral regurgitation and
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Lipid panel was obtained which showed LDL of 86,
triglycerides 98, HDL 26.  Patient will likely need an
outpatient stress test performed once his pulmonary issues
and oncologic issues remain stable.

3.  Oncology.  The patient underwent a bone scan, chest CT
scan, head CT scan, abdominal and pelvic CT performed to
assess for metastases.  There was no evidence of metastases,
however, on bone scan there was evidence of a focus of
radiotracer activity in the cervical spine which may be
secondary to degenerative disease.  Patient will follow up in
thoracic oncology clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] and this
appointment will be arranged for him.

4.  Alcohol abuse.  The patient was placed on a CIWA scale
and there was no evidence of withdrawal.

5.  Pain.  The patient was placed on OxyContin and oxycodone
for his lower back pain.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Squamous cell lung cancer with large obstructing right
upper lobe mass.
2.  Status post stent in right main stem bronchus.
3.  COPD.
4.  Non-Q wave MI.
5.  Lower back pain.
