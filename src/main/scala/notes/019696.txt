Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year old gentleman with past medical history
significant for alcohol abuse and motor vehicle accident
complicated by below the knee amputation and jaw trauma who
presented to an outside hospital on the day of admission with
altered mental status. Per Mr [**Known lastname 2093**], who admitted to being
unclear on the details, and his daughter's report he had been in
his normal state of health until a week prior to presentation
when he went into an outside hospital for jaw pain. He reported
he has been having right jaw and cheek pain for months that is
exacerbation of his chronic jaw and cheek pain since his
accident.  He has been taking a great deal acetaminophen and
aspirin with some improvement in symptoms, but as he did not
feel these results were completely adequate a few days before
his presentation he visited an outside hospital where he was
given oxycodone-acetaminophen and Penicillin. He returned to his
PCP's office on the day of presentation and apparently got a
prescription for more oxycodone-acetaminophen as his pain
persisted. He took [**3-14**] of these pills and was noted to have
altered mental status on his return from his PCP's office. His
daughter and wife brought him to the outside hospital for
further evaluation.

Per report at the outside hospital the patient had a GCS of 12
and a temperature of 101 on presentation there. Labs were
remarkable for WBC of 10.6, Na of 129, and a negative alcohol
level. Toxicology screen was positive for opiates consistent
with oxycodone use, acetaminophen level was 31.4, and aspirin
level was 10.3. He was intubated for increasing agitation and
had an LP performed with 3 WBC, 3 RBC, Glucose of 59, Protein of
53, and a negative gram stain. CT head and chest radiograph were
reportedly negative. Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and acyclovir were
given empirically before the LP. The patient was transferred to
the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU intubated.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS (obtained after extubation): The patient
reports chronic jaw pain over the past months leading up to
admission but really since his MVA in [**2144**]. He denies any
headache, worsened cough, or respiratory distress. He reports
being completely in his normal state of health until he received
the oxycodone.


Past Medical History:
-History of alcohol abuse, last drink 3 years ago
-MVA complicated by BKA and jaw trauma secondary to MVA ([**2144**])


Social History:
History of alcohol abuse but no alcohol in three years. He tries
to limit himself to one pack per day but has smoked more in the
past and has smoked since his teens. He was formerly a clam
digger and has worked other odd jobs but is now retired.

Family History:
Non-contributory.  He denies any family history of heart
problems or diabetes.

OTHER STUDIES:
Chest Radiograph [**4-21**]:
IMPRESSION: 1. ETT tip 6 cm from the carina; standard position
of OG tube. 2. No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT neck w/contrast [**4-21**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence for abscess.

CT head w/contrast [**4-21**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence for intracranial abscess. Fluid level in
the left maxillary sinus and mild mucosal thickening in
bilateral ethmoid, sphenoid and frontal sinuses.

Radiograph mandible [**4-21**]: FINDINGS: There is hardware in the
right mandibular rami. No hardware-related complications are
seen. The patient is edentulous. There is no [**Known lastname **] bony
destruction on these limited images. Endotracheal and
nasogastric tubes are identified. If there is high clinical
concern for subtle cortical abnormalities of the facial bones,
dedicated CT mandibular series is recommended.

Radiograph elbow [**4-21**]: Impression: Old post-traumatic deformity
of the distal left humerus. Two metallic screws are present at
that site.

MRI/MRA/MRV head [**4-22**]:
FINDINGS: Diffusion-weighted images of the brain are normal.
Suboptimal study unable to fully evaluate mandible.  Some
suggestion of chronic small vessel ischemic changes.

Chest Radiograph [**4-23**]:
IMPRESSION: Worsening of the left basal aeration with signs of
volume loss suggesting atelectasis but the progression of
infection can also not be excluded. Increase in left pleural
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old male with history of alcohol abuse, presenting with
mental status change and fever.

1) Altered Mental Status: Given the patient's initial
presentation with fever and altered mental status primary
concern was for infectious etiology.  Tox screen was negative
for any medications not expected in this patient who was
intubated and sedated.  Given the patient's jaw complaints and
history of being on [**Hospital3 **] he was initially treated
empirically for dental abscess and ricksettial disease.  After
he remained afebrile, parasite smears were negative, and further
examination revealed no teeth or likely abscess these were
stopped.  He was never febrile after that.  Blood cultures
remained negative as did CSF culture from the outside hospital.
After extubation on his second hospital day his mental status
was restored to baseline and he never developed confusion
therafter.  Ultimately, most likely etiology of his mental
status changes was thought to be

2) Hematuria: The patient had hematuria of unclear etiology
noted while he had a foley in place.  Foley was removed an he
urinated without problems.  Presumed etiology of hematuria was
foley trauma and this resolved without particular management.
Urine cultures eventually negative for growth.

2) Decreased breath sounds: The patient has a long history of
smoking and no clear infiltrate or pneumonia on chest
radiograph.  Presuming a likely diagnosis of COPD he receieved
ipratroprium and albuterol nebulizers with better air movement.
He was able to be weaned off supplementary O2 without event.  He
was discha
