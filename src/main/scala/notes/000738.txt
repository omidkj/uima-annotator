Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD placement, dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD implantation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year old gentleman with a history of known coronary
artery disease, s/p stent to the left circumflex in [**2144**] and
CABG in [**2160**] with a LIMA to the LAD, SVG to diagonal, sequential
SVG to the ramus/OM, SVG to the PDA. He also has a history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, systolic and diastolic
CHF (EF 35-40%) and atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and
presented for placement of ICD for primary prevention of sudden
cardiac death.  Patient noted several weeks of worsening dyspnea
on exertion, in that previously he was able to walk around the
mall without getting symptomatic, but lately cannot ascend a
flight of stairs without having to stop to catch his breath. He
also had not been sleeping well and is occasionally waking with
dyspnea.  He admitted to two-pillow orthopnea, which is not new.
 There had also been worsening lower extremity edema over the
last few weeks.  He had gone a week or two without taking many
of his medications, including Plavix, Lasix, and metoprolol, due
to him not sending away for his supply of pills.
.
Patient went for ICD placement on the day of admission, and
patient appeared fluid overloaded on presentation.  He received
80 mg IV Lasix x 1 after ICD placement, and was transferred to
the floor.  He was on 3 liters of O2 upon presenting to the
cardiology floor.
.
On review of systems, he denied any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, black stools or
red stools. He denied recent fevers, chills or rigors.  He
denied exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems are negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
At the time of arrival to the floor, patient complained of
dyspnea mostly when he dozes off and falls asleep.  He reported
no chest pain, palpitations, or syncope.
.

IMAGING
-------
ECG on admission:
Artifact is present. Probable sinus tachycardia, although
baseline abnormality precludes definitive assessment of the
rhythm. Left axis deviation. Non-specific intraventricular
conduction delay. There is a late transition with Q waves in the
anterior leads consistent with prior myocardial infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2165-4-10**] the rhythm has probably changed.

CXR on admission:
Current study demonstrates mild degree of pulmonary edema,
significantly
improved when compared to the [**Month (only) 547**] radiograph. The pacemaker
defibrillator
was newly inserted with its lead terminating in the expected
location of the right ventricle. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. There are still
present bibasilar areas of atelectasis and right basal
interstitial changes
that potentially might represent interstitial lung disease
underlying
pulmonary congestion. If clinically warranted, further
evaluation of the
patient with HRCT at some point may be reasonable for precise
characterization of the lung findings to differentiate between
the interstitial lung disease and superimposed part of pulmonary
edema.

TTE [**2166-1-7**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %)
secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior free wall,
interventricular septum and anterior free wall, extensive apical
akinesis with focal dyskinesis. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation, and relatively preserved function of t
