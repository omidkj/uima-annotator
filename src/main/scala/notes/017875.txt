Pertinent Results:
Radiology Report CLAVICLE LEFT PORT Study Date of [**2136-9-3**] 9:49
AM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the chest study of this date, there
is little
change in the appearance of the fracture with overriding of the
distal third of the clavicle.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2136-9-4**] 4:37
PM
Evaluation of the skeletal structures demonstrates now clearly
the presence of a fracture in the left lateral axillary line of
the right-
sided ninth rib. Comparison with the previous study demonstrates
clear
progression of this density in the right lower lung field and
considering
patient's history diagnosis of a lung contusion is suggested.
Also on the
right side there is no evidence of any pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] was admitted on [**2136-9-2**] after a dirt-bike crash at
high speeds, unhelmeted. No LOC. He was found to have left rib
fractures #[**4-6**], L clavicle fracture, and a small anterior PTX.
While in the hospital, the his L upper extremity was assessed by
orthopedics and treated with a sling and pain control. His small
anterior PTX was treated with O2 as in was small and
spontaneously improved. The rib fractures were treated with pain
control and serial XRays ruled out pulmonary contusions. Mr.
[**Known lastname 80126**] course was complicated by a Strep Pneumo pneumonia,
which was successfully treated with nafcillin for a complete
course during his hospital stay. Due to increasing oxygen
requirement a CTA was done to rule out a pulmonary embolus. A
small filling defent was seen in a solitary segmental branch and
the pt was then placed on a heparin drip and transitioned to
coumadin for anticoagulation. However, after several days passed
with anticoagulation, the CTA was reviewed and it was decided
that anticoagulation was not required in light of the degree of
CT findings. Mr.[**Known lastname 80126**] disposition was complicated by
placement issues as the pt made comments of having suicidal
ideations. Both psychiatry as well as social work were heavily
involved during his hospital course. In the end, with the aid of
the social worker, it was decided that Mr.[**Known lastname 22627**] would be
dicharged to stay with a friend until a rehabilitation facility
would accept him as an inpatient. The pt is on several waiting
lists for drug/[**Hospital **] rehab and will go to AA and will continue
efforts to move up on waiting lists.
