Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 18741**] is a 54 year old female with type 1 DM
complicated gastroparesis and neuropathy, HTN, HCV, admitted to
MICU with DKA in setting of gastroparesis flare.
.
Diabetic Ketoacidosis:  Patient intially presented with DKA and
AG of 37.  Patient had gastroparesis flare and unclear if she
was less compliant with her insulin.  Infectious workup was
unrevealing.  Patient was treated with IVF, insulin drip with
D5W, and antiemetics.  Patient was transitioned from insulin
drip to glargine with insulin sliding scale.  She was
transferred to the floor once her gap closed.  On the floor, she
continued to use glargine and a humalog sliding scale.  She was
followed by [**Last Name (un) **] while in house and will follow up with them
on the [**Last Name (un) 766**] after discharge.
.
Type I DM:  Patient was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes 6 years
ago.  She was found most recently to have a HgA1C of 11.0.  She
has had multiple recent admission for DKA and her diabetes is
complicated by peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis.  She was
initially on an insulin drip but then trasitioned to glargine
and sliding scale.  She was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] and will follow
up.
.
Gastroparesis:  Patient complains of nausea, [**Last Name (un) **] and
abdominal pain due to gastroparesis.  Gastric emptying study in
[**1-26**] showed markedly delayed gastric emptying and esophageal
stasis. She was started on hyocyamine SL, an anticholinergic
that causes GI smooth muscle relaxation.  She was started on
standing tylenol with PRN NSAIDS and oxycodone.  She was
continued on standing reglan.  She was treated with zofran as
needed for nausea.
.
Peripheral neuropathy:  Patient reported severe leg pain due to
peripheral neuropathy.  She was continued on gabapentin and
amytriptyline.  She was also placed on standing tylenol with PRN
NSAIDS and oxycodone for pain control.
.
Grave's Disease:  Patient has history of [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease s/p
radioablation.  Patient's TSH has alternated from being
suppressed and being elevated over the past year.  On admission,
TSH was found to be undetectable with elevated free T4 but
normal T3.  It was difficult to interpret these result in the
setting of acute illness.  There was concern for medication
noncompliance at home.  She was continued on methimazole at 15
mg [**Hospital1 **] and started on propanolol to inhibit convesion of T4 to
T3.  She did not appear thyrotoxic on exam.  She was followed by
endocrine.  She will need outpatient radioablation as she is
refusing surgery.  She will need her TFTs checked as an
outpatient.  She will needs outpatient opthalmology follow-up.
Her outpatient physician at [**Name9 (PRE) **] who follows her thyroid was
made aware.
.
Depression:  Patient is on amitryptyline at home, however serum
tox was negative for TCAs on admission, suggesting that patient
is either noncompliant or was unable to tolerate it due to
gastroparesis/DKA.  Patient's utox also positive for Benzos
though patients was not known to be prescribed benzos.  She was
followed by social work because there was concern that an
unstable home environment contributed her her multiple
admissions.  Social work filled out paperwork for the patient to
obtain "The Ride" so she is able to get to her appointments.
.
Asthma:  Albuterol was initially held due to hyperkalemia.  She
was continued on home fluticasone, montelukast.
.
CAD: Patient had negative stress in [**2131**] and normal echo with EF
of 60-70% in [**2129**].  However, she is at risk for cardiac events
given her severe and poorly controlled diabetes.  She was
continued on aspirin and statin.
.
Seronegative arthritis:  Patient has a history of
