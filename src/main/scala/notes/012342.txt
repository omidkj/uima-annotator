History of Present Illness:
82 year old man with a 1 year history of mitral regurgitation/
partial flail mitral leaflet.  He states that he has had chronic
dyspnea on exertion, although over the past month or so it has
become significantly pronounced associated with PND/orthopnea.
He recently went to see his primary physician who found him to
be in atrial fibrillation and started coumadin.

On [**2193-6-11**] he was admitted to [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 620**] Campus for CHF
exacerbation.  He ruled out for an MI.  [**2193-6-12**] echo: Mild LA
enlargement, moderately dilated RA, mild symmetric LVH with an
EF 35-40%. Moderately dilated RV cavity. Trace AI, 4+ MR with a
torn mitral chordae, mild MVP, 2+ TR. Severe pulmonary
hypertension noted.

[**2193-6-13**] Persantine ETT: ventricular couplets noted at peak heart
rate. The preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] was reported as a fixed mild
lateral defect as well as a fixed mild inferior defect- EF 48%.

The patient states that he has felt somewhat better over the
past
two days. Yesterday he was able to do light chores around the
house.
Earlier in the week he was finding it enormously difficult to
sleep due to severe orthopnea/PND.  He denies any significant
history of chest discomfort or palpitations.

In cath lab [**2193-6-18**], RHC revealed RA 17, RV 80/17, PA 80/43 (55),
PCWP 26, CI 1.4. LHC -->, LV 92/21. LMCA mild disease, LAD 40%
distal lesion, LCx 40% after OM1, LCA mild luminal
irregularities.  Summary: Severe biventricular diastolic dysfxn
with severe pulm HTN.  IABP placed and pt sent to CCU for
diuresis and surgery evaluation.  Patient has no complaints.
Denies SOB or CP.

[**2193-6-18**] CXR
The tip of the balloon pump lies opposite the 7th vertebral body
in the mid thoracic aorta. The tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter
lies in the right main pulmonary artery. No gross failure is
seen allowing for the supine position. No infiltrates are
present.

[**2193-6-24**] CXR
Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable, status post
median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement. Right IJ
Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the main right pulmonary artery.
There continues to be a small left pleural effusion as well as
basilar atelectasis versus possible consolidation. Compared to
prior exam of [**2193-6-21**], bilateral chest tubes and
mediastinal tubes have been removed. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. Osseous and soft tissue structures are stable.

[**2193-6-21**] EKG
Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response.
Occasional
ventricular premature contractions. Intraventricular conduction
defect of right bundle-branch block type. QTc interval
prolongation. Anterolateral ST-T wave changes - cannot rule out
myocardial ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2193-6-18**]
ventricular response is slower. Anterolateral ST-T wave changes
persist.

[**2193-6-20**] Abdominal Ultrasound
1. Status post cholecystectomy, with normal appearing bile
ducts.
2. Small right pleural effusion. Bilateral simple renal cysts.

[**2193-6-18**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Selective coronary angiography demonstrated mild,
nonobstructive
coronary artery disease.  LMCA had mild disease.  LAD had a 40%
stenosis
in the distal vessel.  LCx had a 40% lesion after OM1.  RCA had
mild
luminal irregularities.
2.  Left ventriculography was not performed.
3.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated severe pulmonary arterial
hypertension (80/43 mmHg).  Filling pressures were markedly
elevated (RA
17 mmHg, RVEDP 17 mmHg, PCWP 26 mmHg with "v" waves to 40 mmHg).

Forward cardiac output was markedly diminished at 2.8 L/min
(index 1.4
L/min/m2).  There was no gradient across the aortic valve.
4.  Administration of nitroglycerin 200 mg IV resulted in a mild

decrease in PA systolic pressure to 70 mmHg, with a concomitant
decrease
in the systemic systolic pressure to 85 mmHg.
5.  In order to improve forward flow and allow tailored
preoperative
medical therapy, intraaortic balloon counterpulsation was
initiated with
an 8 French 40 cc IAB pump inserted via the right femoral
artery.
With IABP at 1:1, PA systolic pressure decreased to 55-60 mmHg,
and
PCWP decreased to ~22 mmHg.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8389**] was admitted to then [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Medical
Center on [**2193-6-17**] for further management of his congestive heart
failure. He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed
mild coronary artery disease, severe biventricular dysfunction,
severe pulmonary hypertension and severe mitral regurgitation.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed for severe pulmonary
hypertension. Due to the severity of his disease, the cardiac
surgical service was consulted and Mr. [**Known lastname 8389**] was worked-up in
the usual preoperative manner. A carotid duplex ultrasound was
performed which showed no significant stenosis of the bilateral
internal carotid arteries. Vitamin K was given to reverse his
INR from his coumadin. The hematology service was consulted for
thrombocytopenia and found evidence of myelodysplasia likely
secondary to chemotherapy. No contraindication to surgery was
noted after discussion with his oncologist. On [**2193-6-21**], Mr.
[**Known lastname 8389**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent a
mitral valve replacement utilizing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3843**] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 7624**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 49168**] bioprosthesis and a MAZE procedure. Postoperatively he
was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On Postoperative day one, his intra-aortic balloon
pump was weaned off and removed with complication. Platelets
were transfused for thrombocytopenia. On postoperative day two,
Mr. [**Known lastname 8389**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically i
