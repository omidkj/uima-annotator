Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm,
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm involving the common
iliac arteries.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PROCEDURES:
1. Repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm using partial
    right heart bypass and a 24 mm multi branch Vascutek
    graft with separate branches to the celiac artery,
    superior mesenteric artery as well as left and right
    renal arteries.
2. Repair of aortoiliac aneurysm with partial right heart
    bypass using a 22 x 11 mm bifurcated Dacron graft.

PROCEDURE:  Exploratory laparotomy, left colectomy and
temporary closure of abdomen.
Drainage of multiple liters of enteric contents.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Exploratory laparotomy, proctectomy,
kocherizing of the duodenum. Removal of intra-abdominal
sponges and temporary abdominal closure.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Exploratory laparotomy, Vicryl mesh
abdominal wall closure, colostomy and placement of
gastrostomy tube.

Procedure: Tracheostomy

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Left subclavian PermaCath.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Split-thickness skin graft to abdominal
wall, right and left anterior thigh donor sites.

History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 65-year-old gentleman with a
abdominal aortic aneurysm which on CT scan was found to
involve the entire visceral segment of his abdominal aorta,
his iliac arteries and extended into the distal portion of
the descending thoracic aorta. Maximum dimensions of the
aneurysm were nearly 8 cm in the abdomen and close to 6 mm in
the visceral segment. There were large iliac aneurysms as
well. Due to the extent of the aneurysm, it was felt that a
thoracoabdominal approach using partial right heart bypass
was the best way to correct this problem. I might add that CT
scan also showed a suggestion of an inflammatory component to
the aneurysm in the aorta. Prior to the surgery the patient
understood the risks of surgeries, especially the potential
risk of paraplegia, and agreed to proceed. Because of the
complex nature of this operation, requiring the expertise of
both a vascular and cardiac surgeon, and the use of
cardiopulmonary bypass, I asked Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 914**] from
cardiac surgery to be my co-surgeon for this procedure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1924**] is a 65 year-old male who underwent a open
thooracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair on [**2163-2-15**].  For
details of the operation, please refer to the specific operative
note. The cross clamp time was 40 minutes and bypass time was
164 minutes.  He was stable immediately postop, however,
remained intubated and sedated due to the length of the
operation.  He continued to have good urine output and was awake
the following day but remained intubated for diuresis.  It was
noted that he was unable to move his bilateral lower extremities
but able to follow commands with his upper extremities.  A CT
torso as well as MRI was performed which showed a T8-conus
infarct.  Neurology was consulted at that time at if was felt
that nothing further could be done for the cord infcartion.  He
remained stable and was extubated on [**2163-2-19**] and continued to
have good urine output.  He had a increase in his creatinine to
a peak of 1.9 then started to decrease to 1.6.  On [**2163-2-20**] was
found to be unresponsive in the chair and hypotensive. He
underwent CPR, shock and a dose of epinephrine.  He was
re-intubated and underwent a CT head which was negative for an
acute process at that time.  After the code, he required
Neosynephrine and Levophed for blood pressure support.  He
became anuric and renal was consulted and thought it was likely
ATN.  CRRT was initiated on [**2163-2-21**].  He continued to require
vasopressor support (neo synephrine and vasopressin).  He had
atrial fibrillation rhythm on [**2163-2-22**] and his neo synephrine was
changed to Levophed.  He was given amiodarone and his atrial
fibrillation converted to sinus rhythm.  He grew GNRs from his
blood cultures on [**2163-2-20**] and was started on vanco/cefepime.
His central lines were re-sited complicated by a right
pneumothorax requiring a right chest tube.  A CT torso was
performed to assess for a source of his GNRs bacteremia/sepsis
and was found to have perforated bowel.  He underwent an
exploratory laparatomy on [**2163-2-22**] where a left colectomy was
performed for ischemic bowel and his ab
