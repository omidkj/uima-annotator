pain.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with no significant past
medical history who was transferred from an OSH for 6 weeks of
fevers and acute onset lower back pain.  In [**Month (only) 216**]/[**Month (only) **], he
was admitted to [**Hospital6 3872**] (MWMC) for work up for
the fevers, and per patient, they were unable to determine the
source and ultimately attributed the fevers to pyelonephritis.
On [**2146-9-18**], he experienced acute onset of lower back pain that
radiated down his left leg to his left toes.  He has had similar
episodes of lower back pain in the past, but less severe in
intensity.  For associated symptoms, he reported a new onset of
constipation.  He also complained of urinary incontinence;
however, this had been going on for several months.  He denies
any recent history of trauma.
.
Due to the severity of lower back pain, he presented to MWMC
where he was found to have fevers to 102.4 and a leukocytosis of
19.6. He was also noted to be in renal failure with a creatinine
of 2.1 (baseline unknown), thus an MRI with contrast was not
performed.  He was given ceftriaxone and metronidazole and
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the Emergency Department, vital signs were T=102.4 rectally,
BP=195/95, HR=122, RR=18, O2sat=97%RA. On examination, he was
noted to have midline spinal tenderness, normal rectal tone, and
preserved sensation/strength on his lower extremities.  A
post-void residual was measured at 80cc.  Laboratory data was
notable for a leukocytosis to 18.6, renal failure with BUN/Cr
40/2.2, anemia with HCT 30, urinalysis with large blood and [**2-17**]
RBCs.  A neurosurgical consult recommended an MRI of the L
spine. An MRI of the lumbar spine was obtained without contrast,
which showed moderate canal stenosis at L4-L5, severe canal
stenosis at L5-S1, and impingement of the L5 nerve root by the
disc.  No epidural abscess was seen on this study. A CXR showed
mild pulmonary edema with no pneumonia. The patient was given 1g
IV vancomycin and morphine for pain control. Blood and urine
cultures were sent. After 3L of IVF, tachycardia improved to
108.  Reportedly, received 1-2 L at OSH ED.
.
On morning of [**2146-9-19**], the patient was noted to be in
respiratory distress.  Wheezes were appreciated in both lung
fields and CXR showed mild pulmonary edema.  Pt was found to
have O2 sat of 86% RA and he was subsequently placed on 4-6L NC.
 He was given furosemide, morphine,  metoprolol, and aspirin.
EKG was significant for ST depression of <1mm in leads V4-V5. Pt
was transferred to MICU for management of respiratory distress
and flash pulmonary edema.
.
In the MICU, he was started on a nitro gtt, placed on NIPPV, and
effectively diuresed.  Serial cardiac enzymes were elevated,
ruling the patient in for NSTEMI.  Cardiology consult suggested
NSTEMI likely secondary to demand ischemia.  The patient was
placed on heparin for 24 hours and metoprolol for blood pressure
control.  ACEi, hydralazine, and isosorbide mononitrate was also
recommended for blood pressure control, but ACEi was held as pt
was in acute renal failure.  Cath was deferred since he was
febrile and infected.  Cardiology recommends a stress test prior
to any surgery.
.
Pt continued to have back pain and was found to have
enterococcus faecalis in his blood.  TTE was negative and TEE
showed an aortic valve vegetation.  In [**Month (only) 956**], pt had
transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or prostate Bx,
which could have led to endocarditis.  Bacterial sensitivities
were completed and pt was started on a course of Ceftriaxone and
Ampicillin.
.
In addition to lower back pain, he has been having worse
strength in left toes and sensation loss.  MRI L-spine with and
without contrast shows pt has multiple epidural abscesses.  IR
and Neurosurgery were consulted, surgery is being held for now
as pt pain has been improving.  Back pain is currently an issue,
for which he's on Dilaudid PCA, Neurontin, and Valium.  However,
he has not been using his dilaudid PCA.  He received a WBC scan
to look for other sources of infection.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt was initially alert and oriented.
Pt had been encouraged by family and staff to use Dilaudid PCA
for pain control.  Pt complained of decreased rectal tone and
saddle anesthesia, but not confirmed by neurosurgery consult.
Neurosurgery will reconsider surgery if pt clinical picture
worsens, recommend NPO after MN in case needs surgery tomorrow.
Over afternoon, pt actively used PCA, on floor received about 2
mg over 4 hours.  RN noticed pt had difficulty swallowing pills
and had mild aspiration.  In the evening, pt was somnolent and
oriented to the year but unable to report name and location.
Somnolence likely secondary to gabapentin and dilaudid dose.
ABGs were taken for concern about hypercapnia.
