Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82-year-old
female with a history of congestive heart failure and
moderate to severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation secondary
to failed posterior leaflet, now presenting with worsening
shortness of breath.  Her most recent admission to the
hospital was in [**2109-8-4**] for dyspnea.  At the time,
the patient was diuresed, and her symptoms improved.  At the
same time, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization
which, on [**2109-8-23**], demonstrated no angiographically
significant coronary artery disease.  In addition, there was
mild inferoapical hypokinesis with an estimated left
ventricular ejection fraction of 50%.  An echocardiogram
performed at the time showed mildly thickened mitral valve
leaflets with moderate to severe mitral valve prolapse with
partial mitral leaflet flail.  Severe eccentric anteriorly
directed 4+ mitral regurgitation was seen.  Compared with a
prior report, mitral regurgitation appeared more severe.  The
patient consequently presented to the cardiac surgeon for a
possible surgical solution.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Mitral regurgitation (secondary to failed posterior
leaflet)
2.  Congestive heart failure
3.  Coronary artery disease
4.  Possible myocardial infarction in [**2066**]
5.  Mild pulmonary hypertension

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post cholecystectomy
2.  Appendectomy

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once daily
2.  Accupril 5 mg by mouth once daily

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  History of Parkinson's disease in the
family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile, heart rate 67, blood
pressure 132/68, respiratory rate 20.  General:  Elderly
female, in no apparent distress.  Skin within normal limits.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Upper and lower dentures
present, no jugular venous distention, no bruits.  Neck:
Full range of motion.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiac examination:  Regular rate and rhythm,
IV/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
Abdomen:  Bowel sounds present, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities:  Mild edema, pulses present
bilaterally in upper and lower extremities.  Varicosities:
None.  Neurologically grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 35.3, white blood cell count
5.3, platelets 437.  INR 1.2, PTT 29.  Glucose 82, BUN 16,
creatinine 0.9, sodium 134, potassium 4.0.  ALT 13, AST 22,
alkaline phosphatase 49, total bilirubin 0.5.
Electrocardiogram:  Sinus rhythm with occasional ventricular
ectopy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Surgery service.  Given worsening symptomatic mitral
regurgitation, the decision was made to provide a surgical
solution.  On [**2109-9-16**], the patient underwent mitral valve
repair with 26 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring annuloplasty.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.
Postoperative ejection fraction was estimated at 30 to 35%.
Please see the full operative report for details.

The patient was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
in stable condition.  She remained intubated.  She was
extubated on postoperative day one, which she tolerated well.
The patient was weaned off of inotropic support.  Aggressive
pulmonary toilet was initiated.  The patient was maintained
on the amiodarone drip.  She was making adequate urine.  She
was diuresed appropriately.  The patient continued to do
well.  Her chest tubes and Foley catheter were removed on
postoperative day two.  The patient remained afebrile, with a
stable hematocrit.  However, she was transfused with one unit
of red blood cells on postoperative day three for a
hematocrit of 23.1.  The patient also experienced an episode
of rapid atrial fibrillation with heart rate in the 140s.
She was treated with Lopressor and amiodarone boluses.  She
converted spontaneously on postoperative day three.

Physical Therapy was consulted, which followed the patient
during her hospitalization and recommended a rehabilitation
center after discharge.  The patient was transferred to the
floor on postoperative day four in stable condition.  She was
continued on intravenous heparin and also Coumadin.  The
central line was removed.  Her urine grew pansensitive
Enterococcus.  The patient experienced another episode of
atrial fibrillation on postoperative day seven.  Her
Lopressor was increased, her pacing wires were removed.  She
converted to sinus rhythm within 24 hours.

The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on
[**2109-9-27**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.
