History of Present Illness:
61 yoM w/ h/o early onset parkinson's disease s/p placement of
deep brain stimulator (with battery packs in chest), presenting
with two days of fever, cough, HA and myalgias.  At home he
measured his temp to 102.9, describes diffuse myalgias, right
frontal HA (worse than usual HA), and cough productive of a
yellow sputum.  He has no ill contacts, and he has had the
seasonal but not the H1N1 flu vaccine.
.
He has a cardiac history significant for mitral valve prolapse,
status post mitral annuloplasty in [**2199-6-16**].  His course was
c/b RV dysfunction (which seemed to resolve per notes but he
remains on lasix 20 mg QD).
.
In the ED, VS were 102.0, 98, 104/85, 20, 979% NRB (was marked
as 96% on 2LNC with RR 43).  He was placed on a NRB.  He was
given levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1, ceftriaxone 1 g IV x 1, and
tamiflu 75 mg QD, as well as percocet and sinemet.  His CXR
showed inreased interstitial markings but no cephalization,
effusions or focal infiltrates.

EKG: NSR 90, RA enlargement, nml axis, no ST changes

TTE: IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Well seated mitral
annuloplasty ring with increased gradient and mild mitral
stenosis. Moderate puomonary artery systolic hypertension. Right
ventricular cavity enlargement with mild free wall hypokinesis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-10-24**],
the transmitral gradient is lower, but with smaller estimated
mitral valve area. The right ventricular cavity is slightly
larger now with free wall hypokinesis. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is similar. LVEF >55%

CXR PA/LAT [**2201-11-19**]:
HISTORY: Influenza-like symptoms, cough. Evaluate for pneumonia.

FINDINGS: There is mild cardiomegaly, stable. There is no focal
consolidation, effusion or large pneumothorax. There is slight
increased fine reticular interstitial prominence which may be
chronic. Bilateral pectoral stimulator devices with the leads
extending off the film are unchanged in position.
IMPRESSION: No focal consolidation identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 61 yoM with parkinson's disease s/p deep brain
stimulator and h/o mitral valve prolapse s/p annuloplasty,
admitted with two days of influenza-like illness, later
blossoming into a possible multi-focal pneumonia versus severe
DFA negative influenza infection of lungs, which ultimately
required admission to the ICU and subsequent intubation and
respiratory failure. Patient was subsequently extubated and
called out to the floor and clinically improved off abx.

#. Respiratory failure: Although the patient's respiratory
status seemed fairly stable when initially admitted, within the
first day of admission ([**11-20**]) he had to be intubated for
respiratory fatigue. He was extubated on [**11-25**] (5 days). His
respiratory failure seemed due to a primary pulmonary process
(his PNA), rather than a cardiogenic process, as he had fever
and there is no evidence of heart failure on exam or pulm
edema/congestion on CXR. He was called out to the floor with
persistent O2 requirement and continuation of IV antibiotics.
Although the patient was initially treated with levoquin and
ceftriaxone for CAP, his antibiotics were subsequently changed
to Vancomycin 1000 mg IV Q 12H (Started on [**11-23**]) and CefePIME 2
g IV Q12H (started on [**11-21**] to replace ceftriaxone) to cover
aspiration pathogens, given the pt's underlying neuromuscular
disorder. Vancomycin, in particular, was started due to the
patient's copious brown secretions while intubated and resulting
concern for MRSA pneumonia. However, it was eventually thought
that after multiple negative blood cultures, sputum cultures,
and even a negative BAL that pt perhaps never had a PNA and
rather had a DFA negative severe influenza pulmonary infection.
On the floor, antibiotics were slowly tapered off and the
patient continued to do very well. His O2 requirement resolved
with aggressive pulmonary physical therapy and incentive
spirometry, and nebs. The patient was discharged satting in the
high 90s on room air.

#. CARDIAC, VOLUME STATUS: The patient was monitored carefully
to maintain euvolemia. He was given prn lasix while in the MICU
to maintain euvolemia. He was continued on home ASA 81 mg and
crestor. He was given more lasix on the floor to assist in the
O2 requirement and did not seem to improve the O2 requirement.
The pt also did not seem volume overloaded and therefore lasix
was discontinued. The pt was euvolemic upon discharge.

#. PARKINSON's: While admitted, the patient's deep brain
stimulator was interrogated and found to be without any
significant problems.  The patient was continued on his home
regimen of Sinemet, Tamsar, and Mirapex.  He underwent speech
and swallow evaluation on [**11-26**], which he failed.  He was
started on tube feeds at that time.  Speech and swallow eval
