ADDENDUM:  This discharge summary will cover the dates from
[**2122-8-3**] to [**2122-8-5**].

[**2122-8-3**]:  The patient had no overnight events and was felt
to be at her stable baseline weight of 126 kg.  Her vital
signs remained stable.  Of note, her creatinine did jump to
3.3 from 3.1.  The patient's hematocrit was also noted to be
28.4.  This was the first time in one week that the patient's
hematocrit had dropped below 30.  At this time it was decided
that the patient would receive one unit of packed red blood
cells over four hours.  The patient received this unit and on
[**2122-8-4**] was doing quite well and remained hemodynamically
stable with a stable lung examination and weight.

[**2122-8-4**]:  The patient received her final dose of oxacillin
for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus line sepsis.
Her hematocrit had responded nicely to one unit to an
hematocrit of 29.8 from 28.7.  However it was decided that an
additional unit would not only improve her oxygenation status
but would also serve to draw the extracellular fluid into the
intravascular space and therefore improve the likelihood of
diuresis.  The patient was also started on Epogen 40,000
units subcutaneous q. week.  Her Epogen dose was given on
Tuesdays and the hope was that this would improve her
hematocrit as well.

[**2122-8-5**]:  On the day of discharge the patient denied
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, chest
pain, shortness of breath or lightheadedness.  She had
tolerated her second unit of packed red blood cells quite
well.  Her complete blood count on the date of discharge was
white count 10.1, hematocrit 32.0, platelet count 375.  Of
note, in the patient's chemistries her creatinine had risen
from 3.4 to 3.6.

Other laboratory studies of note, on the day of discharge the
patient's blood and urine cultures were still pending.  These
should be followed up upon by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Hospital 191**] clinic on
[**2122-8-12**].

Upon physical examination it was found that the patient did
have some mild crackles at the bases of the lungs and
therefore required additional diuresis.  After discussing the
case with the congestive heart failure service it was decided
that she would be started on Bumex 2 mg p.o. q.d. and that
she would have daily creatinine checks and weight checks.  At
the time of discharge the patient was in no apparent distress
in stable condition, hemodynamically stable.

The patient was instructed to limit her fluid intake to one
liter of fluid per day and to limit her intake of salt to 2
grams of sodium per day.  She was going to be discharged to
be rehabilitated at the [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital and the
staff at JMH is advised to check the patient's daily weights
and b.i.d. creatinine, and call these in to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
