History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year old female s/p sigmoid resection & colostomy
[**2199-6-5**] at [**Location (un) **] for ischemic colitis following syncope at

transferred on Levophed & Dopamine via L subclavian line and had
oliguria of <20 cc/hr. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated, on

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: ? chf ? worsening PTX ? effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old woman with septic shock now extubation, h/o R PTX w/
chest tube, desatting
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? chf ? worsening PTX ? effusion
INDICATION: Septic shock, chest tube placement.

COMPARISONS: [**2199-6-7**].

SINGLE VIEW CHEST, AP: The right-sided chest tube is still
malpositioned with a side port lying within the chest wall.
There is persistent chest wall emphysema. There is a small
right-sided pneumothorax, which has increased in size when
compared to the previous exam. There has been interval removal
of the left subclavian CVL. The right subclavian CVL tip
terminates within the SVC. The NG tube terminates within the
stomach. There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions with
worsening bibasilar atelectasis.

IMPRESSION: Persistent malpositioning of right-sided chest tube
with side port placed within the chest wall. Interval increase
in small right-sided pneumothorax
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2199-6-10**] 3:52 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Eval pneumothorax

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old woman with septic shock, reintubated, and R chest
tube for line PTX. significant crepitus.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Eval pneumothorax
INDICATION: Septic shock, right chest tube for pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: [**2199-6-9**].

FINDINGS: The chin overlies the right apex which limits
evaluation for a small pneumothorax that was present on
yesterday's exam. Subcutaneous emphysema is worsening, and the
side port of the right chest tube still lies within the
extrapleural space. ET tube is unchanged in position. NG tube is
located in the stomach. There is a new small right pleural
effusion. Diffuse aveolar opacities in the left lung and mixed
aveolar-interstitial pattern in the right lung are relatively
unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Chest tube side port external to pleural space.
2. New right pleural effusion, and unchanged bibasilar opacities

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function. No
resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta. Normal
aortic arch diameter. No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch
coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild (1+) MR.
Prolonged (>250ms) transmitral E-wave decel time.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR.
Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. No PS.

PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is an anterior space which
most likely
represents a fat pad.


CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2199-6-13**] 9:56 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: ? recurrent ptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old woman with septic shock, reintubated, and R chest
tube for ptx, now on water seal. please do at noon
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? recurrent ptx
TYPE OF EXAMINATION: Chest AP portable single view.

INDICATION: Septic shock, re-intubated, and placement of
right-sided chest tube for pneumothorax. Evaluate for recurrent
pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with the patient
in supine position is analyzed in direct comparison with a
similar previous study of [**2199-6-11**]. The patient remains
intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea some 3 cm above
the level of the carina. An NG tube reaches far below the
diaphragm. Right-sided chest tube remains in place, seen to
terminate in the apical portion of the pleura. No pneumothorax
is identified. The previously described subcutaneous chest wall
emphysema has regressed, minor traces remaining. No new
infiltrates are seen, however, some cloudy central parenchymal
densities are consistent with the pulmonary edema which
apparently has regressed further.

IMPRESSION: Further improvement of emphysema, regressing
