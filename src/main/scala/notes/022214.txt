REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *5.4 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm)
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.4 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm)
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.3 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.3 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.7 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 3.3 cm
Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: 0.30 (nl >= 0.29)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 40% to 45% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Valve Level: 2.1 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)
Aorta - Ascending: *3.5 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus
in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four pulmonary veins
identified and enter
the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No spontaneous
echo contrast
in the body of the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Mild-moderate
regional LV
systolic dysfunction.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal
anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; basal inferoseptal
- hypo; mid
inferoseptal - hypo; remaining LV segments contract normally.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending
aorta. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve
leaflets. No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. No MS.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the

anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient was
under general
anesthesia throughout the procedure.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial
appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the right
atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is
normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic
dysfunction with basal and mid inferior and inferior septal HK.
The remaining
left ventricular segments contract normally. The right
ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.


POST-Bypass
Overall LV systolic fuction now appears normal. LVEF > 55%.
There appears to
be improvement of the inferior wall. Study ortherwise unchanged
from
prebypass.






Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 73093**] was admitted from [**Hospital6 **] on
[**2129-5-30**] (where he was admitted for STEMI).  He underwent
pre-operative workup, including echo, remained on cardiac
monitoring, and diuresed for some systolic CHF.  He was taken to
the OR on [**2129-6-2**] for CABG X 4 (please see operative report for
details of operation). Post-operatively, he was taken to the
CSRU, was weaned from vasoactive gtts & mechanical ventilation.
He was transferred to the telemetry floor on POD # 1, and has
remained hemodynamically stable.  His hematocrit has been low
post-op (21), but as he has remained asymptomatic, and
tolerating his beta blockers, it was decided not to transfuse
him.  He was started on iron and vitamin C.  He has progressed
well from a physical therapy standpoint, and is ready to be
discharged home.
