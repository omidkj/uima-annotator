Radiology
[**12-24**] CXR: Limited examination secondary to patient motion.
However, multiple airspace opacities seen bilaterally are
concerning for acute infection

[**12-27**] CXR: Mild pulmonary edema has developed since [**12-24**]
superimposed on residual consolidation in the right lower and
left mid lung zones, which may represent pneumonia. Small right
pleural effusion is new, and mild cardiomegaly has developed.
Lateral aspect of the left lower costal pleural surface is
excluded from the examination. Remaining pleural margins show no
indication of pneumothorax.

[**12-29**] PICC placement: Ultrasound-guided puncture of the left
basilic vein, (this is with hard copy documentation of the
ultrasound) with fluoroscopic placement of a 40 cm 4 French PICC
line in the superior vena cava.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo male nursing home resident with dementia, h/o aspiration
pneumonia, COPD, HTN, DM2, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
GERD, angina and a h/o prostate cancer who presents from his
nurisng home with fever, shortness of breath and increased
sputum production, found to have an aspiration pneumonia

1) Aspiration pneumonia: The patient was treated with
Zosyn/Vancomycin, of which he will complete a 14 day course, in
addition to 5 day course of azithromycin. Influenza DFA A/B was
negative. He was briefly on BIPAP in the ICU, but was
transferred to the general floor [**2173-12-27**]. His oxygen was weaned
to 2L NC (98% on 2L NC at discharge). He should continue chest
physical therapy and maintain strict aspiration precautions.

2) Acute renal failure: Likely secondary to volume depletion in
setting of fever. Received IVF to maintain urine output
initially. His creatinine trended down to 1.3 over the course of
his hospital stay.

3) COPD: On prn nebs at NH, which were continued.

4) CAD: The patient was continued on ASA, beta-blocker, and
Plavix

5) Type II diabetes: While in the ICU, the patient's
rosiglitazone was held. This was restarting following transfer
to the general floor. He was continued on a regular insulin
sliding scale.

6) Schizophrenia/Bipolar disorder: The patient was continued on
his home regimen of haldol and Zyprexa

7) Anemia: The patient's hematocrit was stable on discharge (29;
baseline high 20s/low 30s). Iron studies were not consistent
with deficiency. Vitamin B12 was elevated and folate level was
normal. His hematocrit will need to continue to be monitored.
