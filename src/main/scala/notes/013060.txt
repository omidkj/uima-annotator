Chief Complaint:
incarcerated hernia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F h/o CAD s/p MI x2, diastolic CHF, HTN, HL,
hypothyroidism, CVA '[**21**] p/w abdominal pain, transferred to MICU
for respiratory depression. Pt was in her USOH until yesterday
evening when found at [**Hospital1 100**] Senior Life to be in [**9-30**]
abdominal pain, with nausea and NBNB emesis. Pt was afebrile and
vitals were stable. Transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further evaluation.

In the ED, vitals: 97.6, 83, 235/100, rr 22, sat 95% on ? O2.
SBO on CT, related to her ventral hernia. Patient was seen by
surgery who manually reduced her hernia -- felt she is not a
surgical candidate. Pt confirmed she was a DNR/DNI and did not
want surgery even if it was offered. Cardiac enzymes were
positive, and pt was started on heparin gtt. Pt given zofran,
morphine 10 mg total and dilaudid 6 mg total, levo, flagyl,
Aspirin 325. Pt transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3.

When the pt arrived on the floor, pt was unresponsive, breathing
at a rate of [**12-22**] breaths per minute, satting 70% ra. Pt
supported initially with ambu-bag. Pt given narcan 0.5 mg x 3
and became more reponsive. SBP initially in the 90s but
increased to the 190s after narcan. Given lopressor 5 mg iv x 1,
lasix 20 mg iv x 1. Sats recovered on NRB. ABG 7.37/43/188. Stat

EKG [**2135-3-26**]:
Baseline artifact. Sinus bradycardia versus slow atrial
fibrillation.
Anterior ST segment elevations are suggestive of myocardial
infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing ST segment elevation is more
prominent
and rhythm has changed.

[**2135-3-28**]:
Atrial flutter with 4:1 conduction. Possible anterolateral
myocardial
infarction and acute inferior ST-T wave changes may be due to
myocardial
ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2135-3-27**] ST segment
elevations are more prominent in the lateral leads in the
current tracing.

Studies:
CT abdomen/pelvis [**3-25**]:
1. Periumbilical hernia contains a small portion of small bowel
with
distention of bowel proximally and nondistention distally --
correlate clinically for suspicion of early small-bowel
obstruction at this site. Though the neck of the hernia appears
somewhat narrow today, it appeared wide on CT of [**2133-11-27**] and may
be manually reducible. No evidence of bowel ischemia.
2. Chronic severe wedge compression fracture of T12.
3. Chronic bibasilar atelectasis.
4. Diverticulosis without acute diverticulitis.

TTE [**2135-3-28**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the distal half of the septum and
anterior walls. The apex is mildly aneurysmal and dyskinetic. No
left ventricular mass/thrombus is seen. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-5-21**], the
left ventricular wall motion anbormalities are new and c/w
interim ischemia/infarction.

CXR [**3-26**]:
Cardiomegaly is stable. There is bibasilar atelectasis with no
definite evidence of pneumonia. The pulmonary vasculature is
within normal limits.
IMPRESSION: No definite acute cardiopulmonary disease.

CXR [**3-27**]:
A single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2135-3-27**] at 09:10
hours and compared with the prior morning's radiograph. Again is
seen prominence of the interstitial markings which may represent
fluid overload or early edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions
are present. The patient has had a nasogastric tube placed with
its tip not included on the current image but below the level of
the diaphragm.

CXR [**3-29**]:
In comparison with the study of [**3-27**], the nasogastric tube has
been removed. Otherwise, little change in the enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette and fluid overload or pulmonary edema and
small bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with h/o CAD, diastolic CHF,
HTN, and prior CVA admitted with ventral hernia, whose hospital
course was complicated by MICU stay for respiratory depression
in the setting of narcotics as well as STEMI, which was
medically managed.

# ventral hernia/SBO:
The patient was evaluated by the general surgery service while
in the ED, who manually reduced bowel. The patient and her
family declined surgical intervention, and was deemed not a
surgical candidate by surgery team.  She was treated
supportively with an abdominal binder. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] (outpatient
physician) was contact[**Name (NI) **] re: further recommendations for
palliative management. She will see Ms. [**Known lastname 107244**] as an outpatient
for further follow-up.

# STEMI:
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by STEMI in the
context of BP > 230/100, likely related to severe abdominal
pain.  EKG showed anterior ST elevations (V1-3), and peak
troponin 0.87 on [**3-26**].  Follow-up echo showed akinesis of apex
and dyskinesis/ hypokinesis of anterior septum.  Per cardiology
recommendations and patient/ family preferences, the patient was
treated with medical management as she is poor cath candidate.
She was treated with heparin gtt x 48 hours and was con
