25.4 at that time.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo w/ h/o HTN, CHF, afib, history of iron deficiency
anemia, and recent hospitalization for COPD exacerbation
admitted w/ GIB in the setting of elevated INR.
.
1) LGIB- NGL negative.  No prior colonoscopies so unclear
source.  Patient was transfused 4 units pRBCs with appropriate
response in Hct which subsequently remained stable.  Received 2
units FFP and vitamin K x 2 with correction of INR.  Patient
remained hemodynamically stable over a short ICU stay.  Patient
was followed by GI.  No scope performed due to patient's desire
for conservative management.  She continued to have some mild
guaiac positive stools until the day prior to discharge.  Her
INR also started to trend up > 3 after initial FFP/vitamin K,
but responded well to subsequent vitamin K administration.  In
this context, we believe that her increased INR is likely mostly
nutritional, though there may yet have been am element of
medication non-compliance.  We will hold her coumadin for now
given GI bleed and poor nutritional status, to be followed by
her primary cardiologist as to whether she should restart it in
the future.
.
2) CHF- Diastolic based on recent TTE.  Unclear etiology.
Although notes describe R heart failure, patient had a CXR in
[**4-29**] c/w L and R heart failure.  Prior cath in [**2179**] with normal
resting hemodynamics and recent PASP only 39.  However, the
patient does have 2+ TR, whether this is a primary etiology or a
secondary effect is unclear.  Additionally, patient is in afib,
which appears new in [**Month (only) 958**] or [**2184-4-24**].  She had been
recently admitted in [**Month (only) 1096**] for a CHF exacerbation, and was
being gradually diuresed as an outpatient.  Patient was
initially hypervolemic after fluid resuscitation.  During ICU
stay and on floor, she was diuresed with good response to lasix
IV with subsequent improvement in respiratory status clinically
and by CXR, as well as in her peripheral edema.  After a few
days of aggressive diuresis, she became transiently orthostatic
and required 250cc bolus X 2.  It was thought that she was
slightly overdiuresed.  She continued to auto-diurese between
250cc-500cc despite not getting lasix over her last few days of
her admission.  Plans are to continue to assess volume status
and take careful Is/Os vs. weights as an outpatient to determine
whether or not she needs to restart low dose PO lasix.  We were
unable to restart ACE-I given her relative hypotension.  She
should be restarted when able to tolerate it.
.
3) Afib- Patient is rate controlled and anticoagulated at home.
Given low short term risk for stroke and concern for further
bleed, decision was made with recommendations from
PCP/cardiologist to hold further anticoagulation indefinitely.
B-blocker restarted upon hemodynamic stabilization.  She had
multiple episodes of rapid ventricular rate in the context of
metoprolol being held/ [**2-25**] hypotension.  Her rate improved as
metoprolol was titrated to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] upon discharge.  Plans are
to increase beta blocker as tolerated by her blood pressures.
.
4) [**Name (NI) 26601**] Unclear etiology.  History not consistent with
vasovagal syncope.  Likely [**2-25**] orthostasis in setting of GIB.
No events recorded on tele. Cardiac enzymes negative x 3.
.
5) Cough- Chronic in nature.  CXR without infiltrate but with
multiple pulmonary nodules.  Cough may be secondary to CHF vs
ACEi cough vs malignancy.  ACEi initially held without
improvement.  Thought to be secondary to inflammation [**2-25**] volume
status.  Chest CT as outpatient or on floor if patient desires
work up of pulm nodules.  Started her on advair upon discharge.
tessalon perles and robitussin for symptomatic relief
.
6) DM- Maintained on insulin sliding scale with tight blood
sugar control.
