History of Present Illness:
60 yo F with RA (only on plaquenil), HTN, pulm fibrosis, PVD,
OA, tobacco use presents to ED with 2-3 wk h/o malaise, dry
cough, and progressive SOB.  Denies any F/C/NS.  Nearly
intubated in the ED for hypoxic respiratory failure (O2 sats
80s, RR 40s), with significant wheeze.  However, with IV
steroids and continuous albuterol nebs, improved and
stablilized, though still tachypnic with wheeze.  CTA
demonstrated no PE, though large mass (taking up much of RUL,
some of RML that compresses the RUL and RML bronchi, with
?extension into the pretrachial/subcarinial space vs associated
lymphadenopathy, innumerable bilateral nodules and thick
interstitial markings.  In addition, hypodensities were
visualized in the liver.  Started on empiric levo/azithro in the
ED.

ED course also notable for MAT as high as 170 bpm, in part
exacerbated by albuterol, with rate-related lateral ischemic
changes (st dep V3-V6, lateral TWI).  ruling out for MI with
serial neg cardiac enzymes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in respiratory distress.
CT/angiogram results showed a large right lung mass, likely to
be lung cancer, with metastasis to the left lung and liver.  The
prognosis of this cancer was discussed with the patient and her
sister, [**Name (NI) **], her healthcare proxy.  [**Name (NI) **] the patient's
respiratory distress seemed to improve, her blood gases
demonstrated that she was tiring out.  On [**10-24**] and [**10-25**] family
meetings were held to discuss the patient's progress and dismal
prognosis.  At this time the patient was made DNR/DNI but
treatment was continued.  Later on in the night, the patient
became hypotensive and increasingly short of breath.  After
speaking with [**Doctor Last Name **], her healthcare proxy, comfort measures
were started with morphine.  Shortly thereafter, she became more
hypoxic and bradycardic.  The patient had no corneal reflexes,
and had no heart sounds or breath sounds for one minute.  Time
of death was 7:10pm.  The family was present.  Autopsy consent
was granted.
