HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 81-year-old male
nursing home resident with past medical history significant
for dementia, CVA, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, who is
admitted with lethargy and cough.  Patient is a resident at
[**Hospital3 96439**] Home.  He was discharged there following a
recent hospital admission from [**9-14**] through [**2117-9-21**], where he was treated for an aspiration pneumonia.
With this admission, his sputum cultures grew out MRSA and
multiple gram-negative rods and he was treated with
Vancomycin for seven days, last dose on [**2117-9-27**].  He
also was treated for Clostridium difficile colitis and was
started on a 17 day course of Flagyl with last dose on
[**10-6**].

Patient was eating a diet of unpureed foods prior to
admission and was noted to have moderate amount of difficulty
with eating.  He was also noted to have increased lethargy,
decreased p.o. intake, and a nonproductive cough for the day
prior to admission.

Upon arrival to the ED, patient was nonverbal and did not
respond to questioning.

EKG:  Sinus tachycardia with a rate of 118, wandering
baseline ST depression in leads V2 and V3, 0.5-1 mm.

Chest x-ray:  Left lower lobe infiltrates.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Sepsis:  Patient admitted with fever, tachycardia,
leukocytosis and lactic acidosis suggestive of sepsis.  Given
his laboratory and radiological findings, he is thought to
have a likely aspiration pneumonia and along with a
concurrent UTI.

Patient was treated for sepsis per protocol.  He received
multiple fluid boluses to keep his CVP greater than 8.  His
blood pressure was maintained with fluid resuscitation.  He
did not require any pressor support.  A CO2 were monitored
and patient was maintained on oxygen via nasal cannula.  He
was started on IV antibiotics initially Vancomycin, ceftazidime,
and Flagyl.  Patient improved clinically on antibiotics.  The
etiology of his sepsis was thought to be due to aspiration
pneumonia with concurrent UTI.  His stool also grew out
Clostridium difficile colitis, which also contributed to his
septic picture.

Patient was transitioned over to p.o. antibiotics with plan
to treat him with Levaquin and Flagyl for a total of 14 days.
Patient's sputum did not grow out a contributing organism.
He did have sparse MRSA in his sputum, which was thought to
be a contamination as patient is colonized with MRSA.

2. Aspiration pneumonia:  Patient with recurrent aspiration
pneumonia.  Patient has previous admissions for similar
aspiration pneumoniae.  He had a failed swallowing study in
the past, however, his family does not feel patient would
want a PEG tube, feeding tube, or other invasive measures.
They were cautioned that he is at risk for recurrent
aspiration pneumoniae, however, they still declined any sort
of invasive feeding measures.  Patient was treated for
aspiration pneumonia as per the above sepsis description.

Patient was eventually weaned off oxygen and maintained
excellent saturations on room air.  He did occasionally have
mucus plugs with very brief desaturation down to
approximately 90% which cleared with coughing.  He will be
continued on chest PT at the nursing home.  The nursing home
will be instructed that should he desaturate, this typically
clears with coughing and this is not worrisome as long as his
saturations normalize with a cough and clearing of the mucus.

3. Clostridium difficile colitis:  Patient's stool from
[**10-8**] grew out Clostridium difficile.  He was
recently on antibiotics, which likely contributed to his
infection.  He was started on p.o. Flagyl with plans to treat
for 14 days.  His symptoms of diarrhea quickly resolved with
treatment.

4. Coronary artery disease:  Patient with history of coronary
artery disease status post CABG.  Upon admission, he was
tachycardic with slight ST depression in leads V2 and V3.
This was thought to be a strain pattern due to his
tachycardia and septic picture.  Patient was also ruled out
for a myocardial infarction.  His cardiac enzymes were
negative and his EKG changes resolved with treatment of his
other symptoms.  He was continued on aspirin, and initially
his statin and beta blocker were held in the setting of
sepsis.  However, these were restarted prior to discharge.
He also was started on low dose ACE inhibitor.

5. Afib:  Patient with a history of AFib.  A decision made to
not anticoagulate given his high risk for falls.  Patient
went in and out of AFib during the hospitalization.  He was
restarted on metoprolol for rate control.

6. Hypothyroidism:  Patient continued on Levoxyl per his home
regimen.

7. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient started back
on puree foods, which he tolerated well.  He was also placed
on Boost supplement drinks.  He was thought to be at risk of
aspiration as per above, however, his family did not desire
any invasive measures, so p.o. was continued despite his risk
for recurrent aspiration.  His electrolytes were followed
throughout the hospitalization, and were repleted as needed.

8. Prophylaxis:  Patient was placed on aspiration and fall
precautions.  He was also on H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis,
subcutaneous Heparin for DVT prophylaxis and a bowel regimen.

9. Code status:  Patient was initially full code on
admission, however, later in the hospital course following an
extensive discussion with the family, his wife made the
decision as his health care proxy to make the patient
DNR/DNI.  Patient was discharged with DNR/DNI status,
however, they did wish him to be rehospitalized should he
decompensate.
