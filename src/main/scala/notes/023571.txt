History of Present Illness:

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted on day of surgery. It was a long, extensive
procedure, and although the patient tolerated the procedure well
he was transferred to the SICU post-op for close monitoring, and
remained intubated. Of note the patient received 2 units of
packed red cells in the operating room. Pt was successfully
extubated on post-op day 1 and continued to maintain good sats
on room air. Due to his total pancreatectomy, the surgical team
requested a consult from the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes team. Pt continued
well on the [**Hospital1 18**] post-Whipple care plan. Pt did suffer some
mild disorientation on post-op day 3 and removed his nasogastric
tube and central line. The epidural was removed on post-op day
4. Pt's activity level continued to improve, although his family
noted some depressed mood as well. Pt experienced some
aggravation of his long-standing gout, and was given prednisone
and colchicine. On post-op day 5 he was advanced to a regular,
diabetic diet per protocol, which he tolerated well. He also
received the appropriate post-splenectomy vaccines
(meningococcus, pneumococcus, and haemophilus B). Due to concern
over his relatively low nutritional intake, he was encouraged to
take supplements. His elevated white counts and high platelet
levels were felt to be due to his idiopathic leukocytosis of
long history, and a sequela of his splenectomy respectively. On
post-op day 7 the pt continued to do very well, and was
discharged to a [**Hospital 3058**] rehab facility to help optimize his
nutritional status before returning home.
