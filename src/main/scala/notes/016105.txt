Echo [**3-30**]: mild symmetric LVH. LV cavity size is normal. Overall
LV sys fxn severely depressed, EF 15%. Ant and septal severe HK
and lateral and apical akinesis are present with some some
preservation of inferior wall motion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Cardiovascular:

a) Pump: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted after a large anterior wall MI.
An echocardiogram performed on [**2127-3-30**] showed anterolateral
wall akinesis with an approximate EF of 15%. He was initially
supported on levophed, dopamine and dobutamine, i addition to an
intraaortic balloon pump.  Dopamine was weaned off on [**3-30**],
levophed was weaned off on [**4-2**].  Dobutamine was off [**4-3**] but
restarted [**4-4**].  Beta blockers and ace-inhibitors were held
while he was maintained on pressors and ionotropic support.

For diuresis, he was placed on a lasix drip at 5-15mg/hr.
Because he was on so many drips, despite double-concentrating
them, he required lasix plus nesiritide for adequate diuresis.
Pt passed away on [**2127-4-10**]

b) Rhythm: during cardiac catheterization, he had a brief
episode of ventricular tachycardia.  An amiodarone drip was
started and then discontinued on [**3-30**]. On [**3-31**] however, he went
into rapid atrial fibrillation which was attributed to volume
overload.  Cardioversion was attempted twice, followed by
re-loading amiodarone, and another attempt.  After diuresis and
several hours on amiodarone, he reverted to normal sinus rhythm
spontaneously.  He was loaded with 400 PO TID x1 week followed
by 400mg [**Hospital1 **] [**Last Name (un) 2557**] [**4-7**].

c) Ischemia: his initial ischemic event was likely an acute
occlusive thrombus of LAD.  He is status post placement of drug
eluting stents to his LAD.
Aspirin and atorvastatin were continued.  Heparin drip was
continued for his IABP and also for his atrial fibrillation and
low ejection fraction.

Coumadin will be started prior to discharge.

# ID/Respiratory: Post-cath, the patient was found to have
leukocytosis and fevers.
He was initially treated with six days of levofloxacin
([**Date range (1) 12721**]) for empiric treatment of a positive UTI and this was
changed to vanco + flagyl for empiric treatment MRSA pneumonia.
He was briefly on aztreonam, flagyl and cipro for broad coverage
given  some gram negative rods seen on a sputum culture.  On
[**4-5**] the patient developed an erythematous maculopapular rash on
his flanks and chest.  On the suspicion that this was a
drug-rash, and given that the predominant organism on his
cultures were gram positive cocci, only the vanco-flagyl were
continued.

# Renal: ARF likley due to poor forward flow, dye load. Urine
sed w/hyaline casts. ?ATN. Baseline Cr is 1.3.  Creatinine
improved with dobutamine despite agressive diuresis with I>>>O.
We continued to monitor creat closely while diuresing.

# Anemia: having little drops every few days - ?phlebotomy
- transfuse 1 unit pRBC's [**4-5**]
.
# Nutrition ?????? NGT insertion for medications. Maintain NPO.
Nutrition consult.
.
# Endo: We maintained tight glucose control with an insulin
dripg.

# PPx- lansoprazole

# Access-RIJ, left A-line, L arterial sheath with balloon pump
now d/ced, PIV. Successfully placed L-IJ x2 on [**4-6**] but 1 port
didn't flow both times so concerned about clot. Plan to switch
central lines given continued ID concerns.
