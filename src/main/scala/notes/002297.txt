Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62 year old female with a history of COPD and EtOH
dependence presenting with alcohol withdrawal.
.
#  EtOH WITHDRAWAL: We treated the patient with multivitamin,
folate, thiamine, and 1L IVF. She also received Valium 10mg prn
CIWA > 10. Overnight in the ICU, she received a total of 20mg of
valium. Social work was also consulted.  Since the night of
admission, she did not require benzodiazepines, only occasional
zofran for nausea.  She was transferred to the floor, and
required no benzodiazepines there.  We had hoped that she would
return to [**Hospital1 **] for continued detox, however the patient
was adamant on returning home, which we obliged.
.
.
# COPD: Somewhat wheezy on admission, but no evidence for acute
exacerbation.  Currently asymptomatic and moving good air.  The
patient was on standing nebs and fluticasone. She remained
asymptomatic throughout her stay and was discharged on her home
meds.
.
#  Emesis: No history of blood and guiac negative.  We monitored
her hematocrit which was stable. Nausea was treated with Zofran
prn.
.
#  Elevated liver function tests: ALT>AST atypical for
alcohol-related liver disease.  Unclear if acute vs chronic,
given prior history.  Low platelets suggest chronic process.
Hepatic serologies were all negative. We monitored her liver
function tests, which were relatively stable.  After consulting
endocrine, we attributed this to her thyrotoxicosis, which can
cause a transient transaminitis.  Likely also an element of
alcoholic hepatitis.
.
#  History of [**Doctor Last Name 933**]: The patient stated that she was treated
with radioactive iodine and she has not taken any medication for
her [**Doctor Last Name **] for some time. A TSH was not measurable. While her
total T4 and T3 are normal, Free T4 was elevated.  In the
context of tachycardia, her endocrinologist from home was c/s
and he wanted to restart her on methimazole 10mg PO BID and also
propanolol 10mg [**Hospital1 **].  She was discharged on 20 mg of methimazole
qd and propranolol, with follow up in 1 week to check her LFTs
and blood counts (due to risk of agranulocytosis with
methimazole).

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 **].
You were admitted with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and
treated appropiately with benzodiazepines.  Further testing also
revealed changes in your Grave's Disease, which may have also
contributed to your symptoms.  You were seen by endocrinologists
here that agreed with your outpatient endocrinolgist that you
should restart methimazole.  Your new medications here were
methimazole 20mg PO daily and propanolol 10mg PO daily.  You
also indicated that you wished to quit smoking, so you were
prescribed a nicotine patch.  Methimazole can have side effects
of decreasing your white blood cells.  If you have symptoms of
fevers, you should stop the methimazole immediately and go to a
lab to have your blood drawn as per Dr.[**N
