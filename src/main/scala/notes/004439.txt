Admission Date:  [**2141-3-18**]       Discharge Date:


Service:  ACOVE
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hemoptysis.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
80-year-old male with history of tuberculosis, status post
left thoracoplasty in the 60s; history of gastric cancer,
to [**Hospital 191**] Clinic on [**3-17**] with the complaint of
blood-tinged sputum for the past five to six days.  Of note,
he notes fevers to 99 degrees and malaise including
left-sided pleuritic chest pain for the past five to six
weeks.  He was seen at [**Company 191**] two weeks ago.  Chest x-ray was
done at that time, which was negative for any infiltrate.  He
was treated with a seven day course of Levaquin for presumed
this and presented again to [**Company 191**] on the day of admission.  He
occasionally feels shortness of breath at rest and he has
been having an increased cough recently, especially when he
talks.  He also notes increasing bilateral lower extremity
edema for the past one to two weeks.  He has been having
difficulty walking secondary to this.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of tuberculosis status post left thoracoplasty at
the age of 28.
2.  Gastric cancer, adenosea status post total gastrectomy
and Roux-en-Y in [**2131-3-4**].
3.  Mitral valve prolapse.
4.  Coronary artery disease.
5.  Vertigo.
6.  Nephrolithiasis.
7.  B 12 deficient anemia.
8.  Dyspnea secondary to restrictive lung disease.
9.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Levaquin 250 q.d.
2.  Halcion .25 q.h.s.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to QUININE, WHICH CAUSES
A RASH.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former mechanic from
[**Country 532**].  The patient takes no tobacco, no alcohol, lives with
is wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
GENERAL:  Temperature 98.6, heart rate 70, respirations 20,
blood pressure 140/78, saturating 97% on room air.  GENERAL:
The patient is in no acute distress, sitting up in bed.
Pupils equally round, reactive to light, no scleral icterus,
oropharynx clear, no mucosal lesions.  NECK:  Neck was
supple, no JVD, no lymphadenopathy.  CHEST:  Clear to
auscultation on the right.  There were minimal breath sounds
with some bronchial breath sounds at the left upper lobe.
HEART:  Examination regular rate, S1 and S2 normal, no
murmurs.  ABDOMEN:  Benign, midline scar, no masses.
EXTREMITIES:  There was 2+ pitting edema to the knees, no
clubbing or cyanosis.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  The patient had a white count of 13.2,
hematocrit 27.1, platelet count 359,000, INR 1.3.  The
patient had 79% polys, 12% lymphs, 6 monos.  SMA 7 revealed
the sodium of 141, potassium 3.9, chloride 108, bicarbonate
23, BUN 33, creatinine 1.6, which was his baseline; glucose
181, calcium 8.5, phosphatase 3.2, magnesium 1.9.  The
patient's urinalysis was negative.  The patient's chest x-ray
revealed a new opacification in the left upper lobe with a
questionable effusion.

ASSESSMENT:  This is an 80-year-old male with history of TB
status post thoracoplasty, status post gastrectomy for
gastric cancer, presenting with low-grade fevers, malaise,
blood-tinged sputum consistent with a left upper lobe
pneumonia.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted with presumed
left upper lobe pneumonia.  However, the patient was recently
treated with Levaquin.  The patient was doing well initially,
however, started to spike fevers to 101 and 102.  The patient
continued to have hemoptysis causing a blood-tinged sputum.
Infectious Disease was consulted, who felt the patient most
likely had a community-acquired pneumonia and was to continue
taking Levaquin.  However, they also felt that a bronchoscopy
may be warranted.  The Pulmonary Department was consulted,
who also felt that this was most likely left upper lobe
pneumonia.  However, they would like a chest CT, which chest
CT was performed which showed again that there was more of a
pneumonia than a collapse.  There were no masses to suggest
any post-obstructive pattern.  The patient continued to have
hemoptysis and high temperatures despite the Levaquin.  It
was decided for bronchoscopy to be performed, which was done
on the 18th.  Bronchoscopy showed some blood streaking and
some edema from the left upper lobe consistent with
pneumonia.  Cultures were sent, which eventually came back
negative for AFB, but showed some rare E. coli, which was
Levaquin sensitive.  Again, the patient is presumed to have
an E. coli pneumonia, which was Levaquin sensitive and
continued on the Levaquin.  The patient completed a 14-day
course of Levaquin while in the house.  Eventually, the
patient became afebrile.  The patient's oxygen saturations
remained stable on room air.  The patient was ruled out with
AFB negative times three and no AFB grew out from either the
bronchial or the pericardial fluid.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was admitted with increasing
dyspnea on exertion and bilateral edema.  Initial
echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion,
question as to whether it was secondary to pneumonia versus
tuberculosis versus history of gastric malignancy.
Department of Cardiology was consulted, who felt that
although the infusion was large, there was no evidence of
tamponade, and pericardiocentesis was not warranted at that
time.  Given the patient's continued spiking fevers and not
responding appropriately to Levaquin and bronchoscopy, which
was negative for TB and negative for malignant cells, the
patient went on to have  pericardiocentesis on the [**3-27**].  Due to the patient's anatomy, it was very difficult
to get directly into the pericardial space, which resulted in
right ventricular perforation.  Initially, however, the
patient eventually had 300 cc of blood removed from the
pericardial sac.  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for observation while pericardial drain was in
place.  The pericardial drain initially returned 100 cc of
bloody fluid, however, eventually stopped.  The pericardial
drain was pulled on the [**3-28**].  The patient had a
repeat echocardiogram, which showed a small effusion with no
evidence of reaccumulation.  The patient was admitted from
the Coronary Care Unit to the floor on [**Hospital Ward Name 517**], where the
patient continued to do well.  Pericardial fluid cultures
eventually came back negative for any organisms, negative for
AFB, negative for malignant cells, did show some white cells,
which were consistent with reactive infusion secondary to
pneumonia.  The patient is to have a final echocardiogram on
the [**3-31**] to assess for reaccumulation of fluid.  If
the echocardiogram is normal, the patient will most likely be
discharged to rehabilitation.

DISPOSITION:  The patient had the Department of Physical
Therapy evaluate the patient who felt that the patient was
able to walk on his own.  However, given the fact that he has
care of his wife and is very weak, the patient is being
screened for rehabilitation and will eventually be discharged
to rehabilitation.  The patient has completed his course of
Levaquin and will be discharged mainly on cough depressants.

CARDIAC:  The patient was also started on Lopressor 12.5
b.i.d. and Lasix 20 q.d. in house to help with his
tachycardia and to help with his diuresis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Left upper lobe pneumonia with reactive pericardial
effusion.
2.  History of tuberculosis status post left thoracoplasty.
3.  Gastric cancer, status post total gastrectomy.
4.  Mitral valve prolapse.
5.  Coronary artery disease.
6.  Vertigo.
7.  Nephrolithiasis.
8.  B12 deficiency anemia.
9.  Restrictive lung disease.
10. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Robitussin AC cough suppressant 10 cc q.4h.
2.  Tessalon Perles 100 mg t.i.d.p.r.n.
3.  Colace 100 mg t.i.d.
4.  Dulcolax 10 mg p.o.q.d.p.r.n.
5.  Magnesium citrate 30 cc p.o.q.6.p.r.n.

The patient will be discharged to acute rehabilitation
physical therapy prior to being discharged home.

Discharge date is pending echocardiogram results by
[**3-31**], [**2141**].

The patient will followup with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Street Address(1) 16922**], [**Company 191**].
