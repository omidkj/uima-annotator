CT chest with and without contrast [**2173-5-31**]:

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Extensive bilateral alveolar opacities, the pattern suggests
generalized
infection, PCP and bacteria should be included in the
differential diagnosis.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Mild pericardial effusion.
5. Two small splenules, borderline size of the left adrenal.

The referring physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Known lastname **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] by telephone
at the time of dictation.

CXR [**2173-6-1**]:
1. Extensive bilateral alveolar opacities are concerning for
generalized
infectious process. PCP and bacterial pneumonia are included in
the
differential diagnosis.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
3. Left PICC tip projects over the mid/lower SVC.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.




Brief Hospital Course:
#. Pseudomonas PNA - On admission, was believed to be a likely
infectious process given fever, hypoxia and productive cough.
Given h/o CHF, this could be contributing, but she has no
clinical signs of HF.  She has a h/o GGO opacities with multiple
infections in the past. Upon admission to the floor, she was
transferred to the MICU for ongoing respiratory distress and
urgent bronchoscopy with extensive infiltrates seen on CT Chest.
She received vancomycin and cefepime prior to admission to the
ICU and also underwent a CTA chest that was negative for PE.
Bronchoscopy was performed. She was continued on vancomycin and
cefepime. In the MICU
