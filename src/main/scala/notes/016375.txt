History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107485**] is a 61 year-old man with a history of DM2, HTN,
ESRD on HD (T/Th/Sat), atrial tachycardia, cocaine abuse.  He
was recently admitted [**9-/2157**] for pneumonia complicated by afib
with RVR into the 190s.  He was discharged to complete 10 days
of levofloxacin and return to his previous doses of amiodarone
and diltiazem.  It is unclear if he was taking these.  He has
been actively using crack cocaine, most recently yesterday.  He
missed two HD sessions and then developed palpitations so he
activated EMS.  He is unable to provide any further history.
.
In the ED, initial VS:  HR 150, RR 24, BP 200/90, o2 Sat 98% RA
EKG showed SVT. He was given 12 mg adenosine x 1 with no effect.
 He then received amiodarone 150 mg x 2 followed by an
amiodarone gtt.  With this his HR fell into the 120s.  He was
also given 25 mg captopril and 2 g magnesium.  Labs were notable
for hyperkalemia without EKG changes.  He was given 1 amp of
calcium gluconate and 1 amp of bicarb.  Eventually, a diltiazem
gtt was started.  With this his HR fell into the 80s, reportedly
sinus.  He was also given dilaudid 1 mg IV and Ativan 1 mg IV.

VS prior to transfer: HR 88, BP 154/82, RR 22, 100% on 2L
Access:  20g in hand and 18g EJ.

.
In the ICU, the patient denies pain including chest pain.  He
also denies shortness of breath.  Other review of systems
difficult to interpret.

[**11-16**] CXR: There is markedly worsened mild-to-severe pulmonary
edema. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable. A small right
pleural effusion is unchanged. A small left pleural effusion has
increased or is new.

[**11-17**] CXR:
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There has been
interval mild
improvement in the moderate pulmonary edema. Mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly is stable. Small right pleural effusion is
unchanged. Small left pleural
effusion has minimally increased. Dense opacity in the right
upper lobe could be due to asymmetric edema, but aspiration or
infection cannot be excluded. Attention on follow up studies is
recommended. Increased opacity in the left lower lobe is
consistent with increasing atelectasis and left pleural
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107485**] is a 60 year-old man with ESRD on HD and a history
of atrial tachycardia who presents with tachycardia,
hypertension, hyperkalemia, and hypoxia in the setting of
missing 2 sessions of HD.
.
# Hypoxia: Mr. [**Known lastname 107485**] developed significant hypoxia shortly
after admission to the intensive care unit. This was concerning
for rapidly progressive pulmonary edema in the setting of an
inability to excrete volume renally. He was found to have marked
pulmonary edema and received emergent hemodialysis with the
removal of 3.5L. His hypoxia improved significantly. Mr.
[**Known lastname 107485**] received two additional session of hemodialysis during
his admission with weaning of his 6L NC oxygen requirement to
sating well on room air. Mr. [**Known lastname 107485**] was to resume his
outpatient hemodyalisis schedule as an outpatient.
.
# Atrial tachycardia: Mr. [**Known lastname 107494**] EKG revealed an atrial
tachycardia with 2:1 conduction. He was placed on an amiodarone
drip and a diltiazem drip on admission to the ICU. It was likely
that he was not taking his amiodarone or diltiazem at home
because of his cocaine use. He was transitioned to his home
doses of oral amiodarone 200mg daily and diltiazem 360mg daily
(90 QID) with maintenance of his heart rate in the 90-100 range.
In an effort to provide improved rate control, his diltiazem was
increased to 120 QID. This change decreased his blood pressure
but failed to reduce his heart rate, thus he was discharged on
his home dose of diltiazem 360mg daily.
.
# Hyperkalemia: He was hyperkalemic to 6.3 on admission. This
was likely secondary to his renal failure in the setting of
having missed two session of [**Known lastname 2286**]. His EKG was determined to
be stable without QRS widening or peaked T wave. He received
calcium gluconate and bicarbonate in the ED and 30mg of
kayexalate and insulin with glucose. His hyperkalemia was
ultimately treated with hemodialysis.
.
# ESRD:  T/Th/Saturday Hemodialysis - He had missed two session
of hemodialysis and required emergent hemodialysis in the ICU.
He ultimately received three session of HD prior discharge.
.
# Polysubstance abuse: He spoke with the substance abuse social
worker prior to discharge to discuss his substance abuse
treatment options.
.
# DM2: Glucose was well controlled on SSI
.
# Hyperlipidemia: He was continued on his home does of
simvastatin 20 mg po daily
.
# Hypertension: He was well controlled on his home
antihypertensives
.
# GERD: He was continued on pantoprazole
