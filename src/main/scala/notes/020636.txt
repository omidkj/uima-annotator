History of Present Illness:
80 y/o M with PMH significant for presumed lung CA metastatic to
colon, COPD, and CAD admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-22**] with fever and
SOB. Of note, pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**12-16**]
thorugh [**12-21**] on the OMed service for neutropenic fever due to
Klebsiela bacteremia sensitive to cefepime (it was resistant to
levofloxacin and gentamycin). Pt was also treated with stress
dose steroids during this admission. Pt was discharged to the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1785**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on the evening of [**2184-12-21**]. Pt had a difficult
night once arriving at the [**Hospital1 1501**] where he reports having
subjective fevers, chills, rigors, diaphoresis, and SOB. Pt also
developed a cough over the course of the night. He denies any
chest pain, wheezing, abdominal pain, palpitations, dysuria,
diarrhea, or n/v following his discharge. On evaluation at the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1785**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the pt's VS were 100/60  120s-130s  42  85% 2L NC.
He was noted to have significant bilateral LE edema and edema of
the back. Pt was given 0.4 mg of morphine and 0.5 mg of ativan
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

In the ED, the pt's VS were 97.6  124/61  120s  48  80% RA. His
BP subsequencly decreased to 80/63. Pt was placed on a NRB for
his decreased sat and 3L of NS was infused with an increase in
his SBP into the 90s. Labs whoed a WBC count of 15/9, troponin
of 0.35, CK of 176, and a CK MB of 8. CXR was significant for a
new LLL infiltrate suggestive for a PNA. Pt was given
levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. He was also treated
with continuous nebs and solumedrol 125 mg x1. A cardiology
consult was obtained and they felt the pt's elevated troponins
were secondary to demand ischemia from ongoing sepsis. Of note,
a right femoral CL was placed after two failed attempts at an IJ
bilaterally.

He then was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Past Medical History:
1. Presumed lung CA metastatic to the colon- Pt was found to
have mutiple polyps on colonoscopy in 01/[**2182**]. Repeat
colonoscopy on [**2183-9-2**] whoed high grade dysplasia and CIS.
Follow up PET scan demostrated abnormal FDG activity in a lung
nodule and the transverse colon. Right upper lobe nodule biopsy
on [**2184-7-2**] was significant for undifferentiated carcinoma
which was positive for CK 7, negative for CK 20, negative for
TTF-1, and negative for LCA. This pattern is compatible with a
primary pulmonary CA. Pt was started on Nevelbine for treatment
(pt is now day 25 of cycle 2 of Nevelbinie).
2. COPD- PFTs on [**2183-9-18**] were significant for a FEV1/FVC of
60%; FEV1 of 17%; and FVC of 28%. Pt is on 2L of oxygen at
baseline.
3. CAD- ETT MIBI on [**1-/2181**] was significant for a moderate
partially reversible inferior defect. Medical management was
initiated. Echo on [**9-/2184**] was significant for a LVEF of >55%.
4. Hypercholesterolemia
5. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
6. Chronic kidney disease- Baseline creatinine is between 1 and
1.3.
7. H/O DVT
8. S/P pelvic fracture and liver laceration from a MVA
9. Anemia
10. Depression
11. ETOH abuse

Social History:
Pt was previously lving at an [**Hospital3 **] facility but was
sent to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1785**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] following discharge on [**12-21**]. He is a
former construction worker. The pt never married and does not
have any children. He has a 60 pack year smoking history but
quit one month ago. He used to drink ETOH heavily but quit one
year ago. No drug use. He has one sister, but does not engage
her in medical decisions.


Family History:
[**Name (NI) 1094**] father died at age 85. He had DM. His mother died from
"natural causes" at age 85. His brother died in an accident at
age 19. He is estranged from his sister.

Micro:   multiple negative sputum, blood and urine cultures this
admission.
.
Studies:
.
CXR ([**12-22**])- Shows stable cardiac and mediastinal and hilar
contours. Again seen is a rounded mass in the superior right
mediastinum that appears unchanged from prior study. There
appears to be some increased opacity in the left lung,
concerning for aspiration or developing pneumonia. No pleural
effusions are seen. Again seen is evidence of old rib fractures
on the right side.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of increased opacity in the
left lung concerning for aspiration or developing pneumonia.
.
CXR on [**12-28**] after mucus plug and sudden resp decompensation:
HISTORY:  COPD.  Hypotension and hypoxia.
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**12-25**] and 30:
The right upper lobe is newly collapsed.  Increase in marked
leftward
mediastinal shift.  Right lung demonstrates emphysema.
