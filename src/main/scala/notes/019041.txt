CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 83-year-old
Spanish-speaking female, admitted from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Nursing
Home with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  The patient's
daughter is the patient's primary historian, and she states
that the patient has had a long history of fatty food
intolerance and intermittent right upper quadrant pain.  She
also says that she believes the patient had a cholecystectomy
about 11 years ago in [**State 531**] City, but isn't 100% certain.

abdominal pain, especially after eating, but no acute
prolonged episodes.  For the past several days, however, the
patient has vomited almost daily, has not improved with
Compazine, and has taken little oral intake.  Laboratories
from this morning at the nursing home revealed a white count
of 14.6, with 93% neutrophils.  Examination done in the
nursing home by the nurse-practitioner revealed right upper
quadrant tenderness.  She was referred to [**Hospital1 346**] for workup of possible
cholecystitis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nursing home resident at
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  She currently is not drinking.  She does not
smoke cigarettes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 98.7, heart rate 80 to
100 and irregular, blood pressure 193 to 197/89 to 102,
respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 96% on room air.  In
general, the patient is an alert, obese woman,
Spanish-speaking only, who does not appear in acute distress
but seems flushed.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat shows
mucous membranes are moist. There is no obvious scleral
icterus.  The neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.
Jugular venous pressure is less than 5.  The lungs are clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart has an irregularly
irregular rhythm.  There is a II/VI systolic murmur, loudest
at the right upper sternal border.  The abdomen has two old
surgical scars, both midline, one above and one below the
umbilicus. There is definite right upper quadrant tenderness.
There is no rebound.  There are normal bowel sounds.  There
is a vague mass in the right upper quadrant, just below the
right costal margin.  The extremities show trace edema.  They
are well perfused.  Neurologic examination shows a right
hemiparesis, but she can move both arms and legs.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, white count 16.7, 92% polys,
hematocrit 39.7, platelets 296.  Sodium 138, potassium 3.6,
chloride 98, bicarbonate 27, BUN 10, creatinine 0.6, glucose
115.  AST 317, ALT 312, alkaline phosphatase 417, total
bilirubin 3.8, amylase 24, Digoxin less than 0.3.  Urinalysis
shows large leukocyte esterase, greater than 300 protein,
trace ketones, 0-2 red blood cells, 21-50 white blood cells,
moderate bacteria, 0-2 epithelial cells.

IMAGING STUDIES:  Abdominal CT showed intrahepatic ductal
dilatation.  The gallbladder was present.  The common bile
duct was dilated at approximately 18 mm.  The gallbladder
wall was mildly prominent.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound
showed intrahepatic ductal dilatation.  The common bile duct
was noted to be 2 cm dilated.  There were no stones evident
on ultrasound.  The gallbladder wall was noted to be
thickened.  There was no pericholecystic fluid.

Electrocardiogram showed the patient to be in atrial
fibrillation at a rate of 120.  The axis was normal.  The
intervals were normal.  There were ST depressions in Leads II
and AVF, V4 through V6.  There was borderline left
ventricular hypertrophy.  There was no old electrocardiogram
for comparison.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   In summary, the patient is an 83-year-old
female with multiple medical problems, admitted with nausea,
vomiting, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, consistent
with possible cholecystitis vs. cholangitis.

1.  Gastrointestinal:  As stated, the patient was felt to
have possible cholecystitis vs. cholangitis at the time of
admission.  She was started on ampicillin, gentamicin and
Flagyl for broad antibiotic coverage, and her abdominal
examination was monitored closely.  A surgical consult was
called at the time of admission, and the patient was not
currently felt to require surgery, but they agreed with the
likely diagnoses and agreed with urgent endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography for decompression of the biliary
tree.

The patient had endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography performed on [**4-24**].  Findings at
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed the
esophagus, stomach and duodenum to be normal.  The major
papilla showed bulging.  Pus was noted to be coming from the
major papilla as well.  A sphincterotomy was performed, and
multiple stones, from 5 to 20 mm, were extracted
successfully.  In addition, pus was drained from the biliary
tree.  At the end of the procedure, there were felt to be no
stones left within the biliary tree.  The patient appeared
stable following endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography, however, the day following
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, the patient
clinically deteriorated.  She had developed rapid atrial
fibrillation, worsening congestive heart failure, and her
abdomen was tense with rebound tenderness.  In addition, her
blood pressure was relatively low, down at 110/60.  She was
febrile to 101.3 per rectum.  It was felt she may be
developing early septic shock.  She had an urgent
percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder under IR guidance,
and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
closer monitoring.

After percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder, the patient
improved significantly, with decreasing fever, white count
and abdominal pain.  She was started on clear liquids on [**4-26**], and was advanced to full liquids.  Her liver function
tests have continued to trend down throughout this
hospitalization, with her AST peaked at 317 on admission,
down to 22 on the day of this discharge summary.  Her ALT has
gone from 312 down to 32 at the time of this discharge
summary.  In regards to her pancreas status post endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography, the patient has appeared
to be stable, with no increased epigastric tenderness,
however, her lipase was noted to be 258 on [**4-29**], which was
up from 11 on [**4-28**].  At the time of this discharge summary,
a repeat lipase level is pending, and it is presumed to be
trending downward, as the patient has no symptoms.  She has
had no nausea, vomiting, and no increased abdominal pain.
She is tolerating full liquids without difficulty.

It should be noted that the patient's pigtail catheter
inadvertently fell out on [**2107-4-28**].  Her abdominal
examination has remained stable since that time.  Surgery as
well as Interventional Radiology felt there was no need to
replace the pigtail catheter, as the patient has clinically
remained stable.

Abdominal examination on the day of this discharge summary
showed the patient to still have some voluntary guarding in
the right upper
