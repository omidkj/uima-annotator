History of Present Illness:
75 yo male who presented as a code stroke to the ED.  He was
recently seen by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] (see recent notes for details of
his functional status). He describes his underlying function as
mainly watching TV and listening to the radio. He is unable to
do much for himself anymore and requires constant care. He is
still verbal, but apparently is often confused often.

On the day of admission, ~7pm, he was sitting in his chair,
watching TV, when he became distracted, was noted to be
babbling, and then became quiet. His family felt he was probably
tired so they leaned him back in his recliner. About 1 hour
later he then became stiff and then had reported clonic shaking
of his hands and feet. He also had deviation of his eyes to the
left. This
lasted ~3 minutes then resolved. He was sleepy afterwards, but
not incontinent. No tongue biting. No known prior seizures.

He was brought in as a code stroke. Head CT revealed multiple
old strokes and question of worsened infarct in right occipital
region. Hypertensive 220s/150s in the ED. Family memebers report
missed pm HTN medications.

Social History:
Married, lives in [**Location (un) 538**]. Spanish speaking only . He is
currently retired, was an independent truck driver. Tobacco
remote history, quit over 10 years ago. Alcohol use is rare


Physical Exam:
In the ED, he was initially mute with head and eye deviation to
the left, but was clearly awake. NIH stroke scale was not
helpful as he was post-ictal and much of the exam was not
possible. After head CT, Pt became increasingly more alert.

BP 180/155, HR 76, RR 18, O2sat 100% on RA
Gen - Poor attention without painful stim.
HEENT - No carotid bruits
CV - RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs
Lungs - Clear to auscultation bilaterally

Neurologic examination:
Mental status - Awake and alert, not cooperative with exam.
Orientation, recall - Unable to test
Attention - Completely inattentive
Language - No dysarthria. Won't answer questions. Follows
minimal one-step commands. Overall difficult to assess given
mental status, inattention, and
confusion.

Cranial Nerves -
I: not tested
II: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to 3 mm
bilaterally. Visual fields are limited, ?R hemianopia.
III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact bilaterally without
nystagmus.
V, VII: Facial strength and sensation intact and symmetric.
VIII: Hearing intact bilaterally to snap.
IX, X: Palatal elevation symmetrical
XII: Tongue midline without fasciculations.
Head deviation to the left.

Motor - Normal bulk. Tone increased in RUE and legs bilaterally.
No tremor
Moving all extremities spontaneously and also briskly to noxious
stim, but moves RLE slightly less then LLE.

Sensation - Intact to light touch and pain in all extremities

Reflexes:

Toes were downgoing on left, up on right + grasp bilat.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro - Seizure likely related to prior strokes. No evidence of
new acute infarct on CT; unable to have MRI d/t presence of
pacer. Continued aspirin. Started Dilantin. Level therapeutic at
the time of discharge. No further seizure activity observed. Pt
remained very confused, baseline per family. Pt's gait remained
very unsteady with significant retropulsion (unsteady gait also
present prior to admission). Evaluated by PT, OT; referred for
acute rehabilitation.

CV - Had limited episodes of atrial tachycardia. Cardiology
service consulted. Atrial tachycardia possibly from tricuspid
annular origin. Re-entrant SVT also possible, but not clearly
demonstrated. Pt was previously controlled with Amiodarone, but
had toxicity with confusion, hallucinations, and the medication
was stopped. Sotalol was continued, but increased to 80mg [**Hospital1 **]
for improved rate control. Pacer settings adjusted to DDI 70 by
Elecrophysiology service. Given confusion, fall risk, etc, Pt is
a poor candidate for anti-coagulation with Coumadin. Patient was
also hypertensive to 170-200 the day before discharge, and
antihypertensives were increased. Norvasc was added to regimen.
Patient's PCP will be notified of this so that she may work with
colleague at [**Hospital3 537**].

Resp - Being treated with Levofloxacin through [**1-16**] for R
middle lobe pneumonia.

Endo - Continued Glipizide, Rosiglitazone. Insulin sliding scale
prn.

Prophylaxis - SC heparin, pneumoboots, colace, PPI.

Dispo - Discharged to acute rehabilitation in stable condition.
