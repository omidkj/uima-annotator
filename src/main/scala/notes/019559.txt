Brief Hospital Course:
She was initially stable after transfer but after 2-3 hours
decompensated and was taken to the cath lab. She was found to
have patent stents, but she continued to deteriorate. She was
placed on ECMO, and then was taken to the OR with vascular
surgery for repair of her Left CFA, CFV, and EIA at the site of
the previous IABP.  TEE showed Ebsteins anomaly with markedly
dilated RA/RV with focal RV hypokinesis, severe TR, small LV
with focal inferior hypokinesis with EF > 60%, trace MR, no AI.
On [**9-14**] she was taken to the operating room where she underwent
placement of and RVAD and removal of ECMO. She was transferred
to the SICU on epinephrine, milrinone, levophed and propofol as
well as Nitric oxide. She developed fevers for which she was
cultured and ID was consulted. Cultures remained negative, she
was placed on broad antibiotic coverage. She remained intubated
and paralyzed, with likely ARDS. She was seen by hematology for
difficulty maintaining a therapeutic ptt and thrombocytopenia.
She was HIT -, and the thrombocytopenia was thought to be
secondary to the VAD as well as illness. She was started on tube
feeds. Vascular continued to follow her for her groin incisions,
which eventually required VAC dressing. Her sternal wound
developed purulent draiange, and the wound was opened and a vac
dressing was applied there as well. She remained on vanco, zosyn
and flagyl. CT scan of head/chest abdomen/pelvis on [**9-23**] was
essentially negative for infection with the exception of a 7.3
cm right groin fluid collection. There as no bleed or infarct on
head CT. She was seen by optho for conjunctivitis and placed on
erythromycin ointment.  She continued to have fever and white
count, but negative cultures. TEE on [**9-25**] showed no eveidence of
endocarditis. Her respiratory status improved and her sedation
was weaned. CXR showed slow resolution of ARDS. Her zosyn was
changed to meropenum given the continued fevers, as well as
fluconazole for some yeast growth from her wounds. She remained
febrile despite antibiotic change, however her white count began
to improve.
She was taken to the cath lab on [**10-7**] for placement of a PA
cath in preparation for RVAD weaning.
Fevers continued, she remained on vanco, fluc, and ceftaz was
started on [**10-8**].
On [**10-8**] she was found to have melena  and HCT drop, and GI was
consulted. Gastric lavage showed maroon/black but no fresh
blood. She was started on a protonix drip. EGD showed blood in
the stomach, and findings consistent with hemorrhagic gastritis.

Her heparin was stopped and she was started on Dextran.
Her LFTs increased, and then began to improve. Her [**Last Name (un) 3041**] was
dc'd. Hepatitis serologies were sent.
Her fever started on improve and at the time of discharge she
was afebrile for about 48 hours.
