Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1493**]
Chief Complaint:
Delerium, hepatitis, concern for biliary obstruction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with
sphincterotomy; intubation with successful extubation;
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 39868**] is a 60 year-old man with history of active alcohol
abuse, previously normal mental status, who was admitted to [**Hospital 6451**] Hospital on [**2138-2-22**] with 4 day h/o hematemasis and
black/tarry stools found to have Hct of 13.5 on admission, EGD
showed [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear which was actively bleeding and was
clipped. EGD was otherwise unremarkable no varices were seen in
esophagus or stomach. He was transfused 6 units PRBC. His course
was complicated by an [**Doctor Last Name 7792**] in the setting of his anemia, and
this was managed medically with beta blockade. In addition, he
developed SVT with respiratory distress, pulmonary edema on CXR,
and was reportedly electively intubated and started on an
amiodarone gtt and diuresed. During this episode, he was also
transiently hypotensive requiring vasopressors (first dopamine,
then phenylephrine) which were weaned off after an unclear
duration. Following extubation, the patient was noted to be
markedly delirious with disorientation and agitation; per his
wife.

During his admission at [**Hospital3 **], he was noted to have new
jaundice with worsening bilirubinemia/transminitis; a RUQ
ultrasound on [**2138-2-27**] showed a distended gallbladder with
sludge, mild GB wall thickening, small amounts of
pericholecystic fluid, and a mildly prominent CBD. A
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was inserted on [**2138-2-28**] out of
concern for cholecystitis. A followup ultrasound showed an
increasing amount of abdominal ascites and continued evidence of
acalculous cholecystitis (as well as echogenic liver texture
with fatty infiltration) and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2138-3-9**] for ERCP.

Past Medical History:
- alcohol abuse with reported history of delirium tremens
(circumstances unclear)
- CAD with [**Name (NI) 7792**] in [**2123**], then two others; denies stenting but
says he had a 'balloon' procedure
- HTN (stopped medications in [**2123**])
- Hyperlipidemia (stopped medications in [**2123**])
- H/o tobacco abuse (quit [**2123**])

Social History:
Alcohol abuse, drank 1 pint with 2-3 beers daily since [**2121**];
prior to that drank about half as much.  Quit [**2123**], (+) Tobacco
use 3 ppd x 25 years. Without h/o of IVDU.  Previously stocked
shelves.  Lives with wife, [**Name (NI) **], in [**Name (NI) 39869**].  One daughter.

ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  [**2138-3-10**] 10:24 AM
1. Diffusely echogenic liver consistent with fatty changes. More
severe forms of hepatic disease such as fibrosis cannot be
excluded.
2. Splenomegaly.
3. A moderate amount of sludge is noted within the gallbladder.
There is no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
4. Small amount of ascites in the right lower quadrant ascites,
not deemed sufficient for therapeutic drainage.

ERCP BILIARY&PANCREAS BY GI UNIT  [**2138-3-11**] 2:35 PM
FINDINGS: Eleven fluoroscopic images were obtained without a
radiologist present. These were submitted for review.
Fluoroscopic images demonstrate slight tapering of the
intrahepatic biliary ducts. This may be consistent with
cirrhosis. There is no biliary dilatation identified. Per
report, sludge was removed from the common hepatic duct.
IMPRESSION: Tapering of intrahepatic biliary ducts without
dilatation. This suggests cirrhosis.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2138-3-13**] 1:20 PM
A round hypodensity likely represents a chronic lacune in the
deep white matter (2A:14). Mild prominence of the sulci is
indicative of age- inappropriate brain parenchymal atrophy.
There are dense calcifications of the intracranial carotid and
vertebral arteries. There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema,
masses, mass effect, or acute infarction. No fractures are
identified.  IMPRESSION: Age-inappropriate prominence of sulci
and chronic deep white matter lacune. No evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage or ischemia.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2138-3-15**] 7:31 PM
1. Supporting lines in satisfactory positions.
2. Stable bilateral upper lobe opacities may be secondary to an
acute pneumonia, however, cannot exclude a chronic underlying
interstitial abnormality including pneumoconiosis. If clinically
warranted, consider CT for further evaluation.

EEG Study Date of [**2138-3-16**]
This is an abnormal portable EEG in the waking and drowsy
states as the majority of the tracing demonstrated a poorly
organized
and slow background interrupted with brief bursts of moderate
amplitude
generalized mixed frequency slowing. With stimulation, a poorly
sustained low voltage fast background appeared briefly. This
constellation of findings is indicative of a mild encephalopathy
due to
dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.

Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the
common
causes of encephalopathy. There were no areas of prominent focal

slowing, althought encephalopathic patterns can sometimes
obscure focal
findings. There
