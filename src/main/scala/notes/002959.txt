TEE: [**2113-3-8**]
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal. The sinuses of Valsalva are dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.

IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence for endocarditis. Mild
mitral
regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation.

[**2112-3-8**]: CT of C/A/P
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection. No evidence of proximal
pulmonary embolism. Please note that evaluation of small
peripheral pulmonary arteries in lower lobes are somewhat
limited due to atelectasis and technique.
2. Bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis.
3. Incidentally noted aberrant right subclavian artery with
dilated origin, probably representing Kommerell diverticulum.
4. Cholelithiasis.

Brain MRI: [**2113-3-7**]
Findings consistent with leptomeningitis most prominently
demonstrated in the left frontal region. There is no evidence of
abscess formation


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 78 year old male with fevers, headache - LP c/w meningitis.
.
1. Fever and headache: Patient's LP consistent with bacterial
meningitis. He was initially covered with Vancomycin,
Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone, Decadron and Acyclovir. Patient quickly
defervesed initially, but became hypotensive. Patient had 3
large bore IVs placed on the floor, when his SBP dropped to 70s.
Patient received > 7L NS boluses and was eventually taken to the
ICU for observation. There, he received a L of Ringer's Lactate
and his SBP stabilized in 110s range. Patient was mentating
throughout. His lactates remained flat. Patient then returned to
the medical floor. His HSV PCR was negative and Acyclovir was
stopped. Patient's Vanco also stopped. Patient then developed a
severe headache and an MRI of the brain revealed evidence of
leptomential infection w/o abscess. ID consulted. Patient's
Vancomycin, Ampicillin and decadron discontinued and patient
continued on Caftriaxone. Patient's initial blood cultures from
day of admission returned positive for peptostreptococcus and
patient continued on Ceftriaxone. Patient then began to spike
temps to > 102 and all subsequent blood cx negative. Patieent
also had CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis, which was negative for
embolic disease. A TEE was negative for vegetation. ID then
recommended changing abx to Ampicillin form Ctx for better
peptostreptococcus coverage. Patient continued on ampicillin as
ID attempted to get sensitivities for the peptostreptococcus.
The patinent will need to continue on Ampicillin for 2 weeks, or
until the Infectious Disease team at the [**Hospital3 **] instructs
differently. Patient will need to have blood cultures drawn for
fever > 101.5. He will also need Urinalysis and urine culture if
he complains of dysuria and chest X-Ray if he develops hypoxia
or shortness of breath. Patient's headache was managed with
tylenol.
.
2.  Hypotension - Patient dropped SBP down to 70's and c/o
dizziness.  SBP returned to 110s with > 7L fluid bolus challeng.
Initially had EKG to eval for cardiac cause of hypotensi
