History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F w/hx of afib on coumadin, COPD, MR, TR
who presented on [**2150-5-1**] from her nursing home with falls and
questionable left facial droop.  She was initially a code stroke
in the ED.  She was evaluated by neurology who determined that
she did not have a stroke and she did not require further
neurologic evaluation.  She had CT head noncon and CTA
head/neck, both were negative. She also had a negative urine and
CXR except cardiomegaly.  On admission she required 3L NC.  Over
the course of her hospitalization she has developed worsening
hypoxia so that in the evening of [**2150-5-2**] she required 100%
facemask.  She was given 40mg IV Lasix and urinated 1700ml and
improved to 2L NC.  CTA done overnight showed no PE but did show
bileratal pleural effusions L>R with LLL collapse and
mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Over the course of the day on
[**2150-5-3**] she again had worsening oxygen requirement and developed
worsening tachycardia with afib and RVR.  Blood pressure was
stable in the 130s-140s/80s-90s.
.
On arrival to the ICU, she is breathing comfortably. She denies
shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations.  She has not had
fevers, chills or night sweats.  She has no cough.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient transferred to ICU with worsening hypoxia and afib with
RVR.

1. Hypoxia:  On admission patient had a new oxygen requirement,
3L nasal cannula, while at baseline she was on room air.
Throughout her admission, patient denied shortness of breath but
did complain of fatigue.  Given her rapid heart rate, the
patient underwent a CTA to rule out PE.  CTA showed bilateral
pleural effusions with LLL collapse, but no PE.  Given CTA
findings her initial presentation was thought to be secondary to
heart failure, possibly exacerbated by a fib w/ RVR and she was
diuresed with po lasix.  CTA did show extensive mediastinal
lymphadenopathy and so infectious vs. malignant etiologies were
considered.
.
Over the course of her hospitalization, she required two
admissions to the MICU.  On [**2150-5-3**] she decompensated with
hypoxia and A-fib with RVR with a question of aspiration event.
Her a-fib was managed by increasing metoprolol dose and digoxin
loading/maintenance with good HR (70s-80s) and BP control
(110-120s).  Given the rise in WBC, she was started and
completed an 8 day course for HCAP with vanc and zosyn.  She was
diuresed in the with iv lasix.  A TEE was done that showed
diastolic dysfunction and BNP was elevated to 10K.  CE were
trended but were flat.  She was transferred to the floor for
further management.
.
On the floor patient improved with diuresis and antibiotic
course.  Her leukocytosis also downtrended.  Speech and swallow
consulted who did not see si/sx of aspiration.  However, there
remained concern that patient was aspirating and she was placed
on aspiration precautions.  She had another episode of hypoxia
with afib and RVR requiring NRB; ABG on NRB showed 7.52/36/65/30
with lactate 4.8.  She was transferred to the MICU a second
time.  A repeat Chest CT was concerning for right middle lobe
pneumonia, patient weaned off to nasal cannula and lactate
trended down.  Patient was diuresed and transferred back to the
floor.  On [**5-12**], patient spiked a fever, and was started on iv
meropenem and vanc for an 8 day course of aspiration pneumonia,
and pan-cultured.  She improved with antibiotics and
defervesced.  Urine and blood culture showed no growth on
discharge.
.
Patient was managed with chest PT and aggressive pulmonary
toilet.  Pulmonology was consulted, who agreed with management
of antibiotics, diuresis, and BP/rate control.  Given her
anatomy thoracentesis thought to be unlikely to result in
re-expansion of her left lung.  Goals of care were discussed
further with patient.  Patient decided that further MICU
transfers were not align with her goals of care and decided to
be DNI.  Patient was discharged to nursing facility with plans
to transition to hospice care.  Ultimately decision was made
with family and patient for do not hospitalize as this would not
be consistent with patient's goals of care.
- Continue iv vanc and meropenem until [**2150-5-20**] to complete 8
day course
- Continue nasal cannula, wean as tolerated
- Patient has decided to be: DNR/DNI/DNH
.
2. Afib with RVR: This may have been precipitated by lung
etiology given hypoxia.  Blood pressure was initially stable
though dipped into the low 100s systolic.  She was on Metoprolol
on admission which was increased to 75mg PO TID.  Patient had
several episodes of RVR to 160s which were managed with gentle
bolus, with minimal response, then IV metoprolol and IV dilt.
She was ruled out for an MI, and infectious work up was
revealing for pneumonia.  Her coumadin was initially held given
her history of falls.  This was restarted during her
hospitalization.  However, as patient remained hypoxic and weak,
further discussions regarding risk/benefit of coumadin were had
with patient and son. Ultimately, the immediate risks of bleed
were thought to outweigh the long-run benefits. Coumadin was
stopped on discharge.
- Hold metoprolol or diltiazam if SBP<100, HR<60
.
3. Acute Heart Failure: CT scans notable for bilateral pleural
effusions. A TTE was done that showed EF 55%, RV moderately
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. CE were
negative.  She was maintained with lasix, bb, ccb, and digoxin.
She was transitioned from iv lasix to 40mg PO lasix, to keep net
even to 500cc net negative.
- Suspect that lasix
