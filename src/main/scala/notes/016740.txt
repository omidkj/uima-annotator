Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
S/P Fall with transfer from outside hospital with head bleeds

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left sided subdural hematoma evacuation


History of Present Illness:
61 y/o M w/ h/o MVC resulting in coma 5 yrs ago and 2 SDH
resulting after bad falls in subsequent years presents to ED
with
CT scan showing SDH, SAH after wife noticed pt acting more
lethargic, sleepy and agitated over the past 4 days.
Wife states that the patient fell out of bed at 8pm on [**1-24**] and

EMS was called to bring pt to [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital. She also states
that on Wednesday night, she heard a thud at 1am and did not
investigate the noise. She suspects that the patient fell at
that
time as well. Patient denies loss of consciousness, but does
state that he hit his head.
At baseline, the patient has an unsteady gait and dysarthric
speech acording to his wife. She became worried when she noticed

that the patient wasn't acting quite right, his eyes had not
been
focusing like they usually do.


Past Medical History:
hypertension, depression, CAD with cardiac arrest, anxiety, s/p
MVC 5yrs ago resulting in a coma for 7 days and deficits in gait
and speech, s/p fall backwards 4yrs ago resulting in SDH, s/p
fall down stairs 2-3yrs ago resulting in left frontal lobe SDH
with midline shift.

pt lives at home with his wife as caretaker, attends
adult daycare

CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD
PRELIMINARY REPORT:  Provided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18936**].  He indicated "Left
extra-axial
hematoma representing epidural hematoma has increased in size,
measuring 26 mm in greatest dimension.  Mass effect on the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle is new.  Right and
left-sided subdural hematoma also along the falx and layering
over the tentorium.  Subarachnoid hemorrhage, more significant
on the left.  Minimal effacement of the suprasellar cistern and
compression of the brainstem is concerning for impending
herniation.  Nasogastric tube is coiled within the oropharynx.
No gross aneurysm.  Old nasal bone fracture. Paranasal sinus
mucosal disease.  Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 5:30 a.m.

FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital CT scan
does indicate
that there has been relatively prominent interval increase in
size of the
left-sided posterior temporal extra-axial hemorrhage.  I believe
this finding still represents subdural hemorrhage, as there is
also considerable subdural blood more anteriorly overlying the
anterior aspect of the left temporal lobe. The large right-sided
cerebral convexity acute subdural hemorrhage is stable in size.
There is somewhat increased mass effect upon the left atrium,
and perhaps a few millimeters rightward shift of the septum
pellucidum.  The suprasellar cistern, particularly when viewed
on the CT angiographic sections, remains visible.

There is probably a minimal quantity of subarachnoid blood in
the left sylvian fissure and layering in the left atrium.

As was noted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18936**], the nasogastric tube is coiled in the
oropharynx.

CT angiography was obtained.  Compared with the prior CT
angiogram performed on [**2157-7-4**], there does not appear to be
any overt interval change.  There is the expected displacement
of the cortical vessels away from the inner table of the skull,
secondary to the large extra-axial hemorrhages.  No definite
sign of an aneurysm is seen.  Moreover, there is redemonstration
of the apparent discontinuous appearance of the basilar artery.
It was my impression at that time of the first study that there
was a left-sided trigeminal artery present, which is a
congenital carotid/basilar anastomosis accounting for the
basilar artery discontinuity.  The CT angiogram does not appear
to show definite sign of an aneurysm at this time.

CONCLUSION:

1.  Enlargement of left posterior temporal component of large
subdural
hemorrhage, compared with the prior study.

2.  Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage within the left
sylvian fissure. Tiny amount of blood within the left lateral
ventricle.

[**1-25**]
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT

FINDINGS:  Patient underwent interval repeat left-sided
craniotomy with new post-operative and subcutaneous
pneumocephalus/emphysema.  The majority of the left-sided
extra-axial hemorrhage has been evacuated with a small component
remaining.  Additionally the amount of subdural hemorrhage
tracking along the falx and tentorium appears improved.
Right-sided subdural hematoma is not significantly changed
extending up to 16 mm from  the skull base (2:10).
Intraventricular hemorrhage is again noted within the lateral
ventricles bilaterally with a small component likely within the
inferior fourth ventricle.  There has been worsening of
hydrocephalus involving the left lateral ventricle with
dilatation of the occipital and temporal horns which is new from
prior exam.  Additionally there is slightly increased mass
effect noted along the right lateral ventricle. Suprasellar and
ambient cisterns remain patent.  Regions of encephalomalacia
involving the left frontal and parietal lobe are stable as is
diffuse paranasal mucosal sinus disease. Subarachnoid components
bilaterally are not significantly changed.

IMPRESSION:
1. Evacuation of left-sided extra-axial component with decreased
subdural
hemorrhage tracking along the falx and tentorium.  Right-sided
subdural
hematoma displays no short interval change from 5 a.m.
examination.

2.  Persistent intraventricular hemorrhage within the lateral
ventricles and likely within the fourth ventricle.  There is new
hydrocephalus involving the left ventricle predominantly within
the occipital and temporal horns which are dilated.  Part of
this may relate to re-expansion after evacuation.  Slightly
increased mass effect noted along the right lateral ventricle.

3.  Diffuse unchanged subarachnoid hemorrhage.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Preliminary Report
FINDINGS:  Similar appearance of left subdural hematoma status
post
evacuation, although with decreased pneumocephalus.  Similar
appearance of
subdural hemorrhage tracking along the falx and tentorium.
Right-sided
subdural hematoma is essentially unchanged measuring up to 13
mm.
Intraventricular hemorrhage is seen bilaterally, although more
pronounced on the left.  Slight improvement of hydrocephalus
involving the left ventricle with decreased size of the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].  Ma
