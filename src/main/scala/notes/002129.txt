Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
chest discomfort and shortness of breath x 2 months

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mediastinoscopy with lymph node biopsy - pathology pending


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 37 year old female with PMH endometrial cancer
s/p TAH w/ R oopherectomy who presented to a [**Hospital 11074**] clinic with
two month history of shortness of breath and chest pain. She
describes the chest pain as "like an elephant standing on her
chest". She notes that it is associated with dyspnea,
diaphoresis, and lightheadedness. She was referred to a
cardiologist for a nuclear stress test about 6 weeks ago which
was normal per pt. Symptoms persisted over last three weeks with
increased fatigue and weakness. She also notes waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
feversv(Tm 100-101), productive cough and 18 pound weight loss
during this time. At the [**Hospital 11074**] clinic on [**7-8**], a chest x-ray
was done which was significant for mediastinal widening. She was
immediately taken by ambulance to Falumouth ED. At [**Hospital1 1562**], a
Chest CT showed diffuse mediastinal adenopathy and multiple
pulmonary nodules and splenomegaly. An echo showed small-
moderate pericardial effusion and increased tuerculation in RV
apex c/w RVA thrombus. NL EF/valves. Doppler US LE - Left
popliteal DVT. V/Q scan - indetermingate - 50% chance of PE.
Patient was stable during one day admission at [**Hospital1 1562**] and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further work up of the pulmonary
nodules and lymphadenopathy.  While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was
seen by pulmonary and oncology. She was sent for a chest and
abdominal CT which suggested a 5x4 cm mediastinal mass with
precarinal lymph nodes, multiple smaller nodules throughout both
lungs and a small-moderate pericardial effusion. She was
hemodynamically stable in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and transferred to the floors
on [**7-10**] pm.

The patient denies headaches/abdominal pain/melena/hematochezia/
change in bowel movements/dysuria.

The patient does note 10 year history of perimenopausal symptoms
- fatigue, myalgias, hot flashes, low grade temps.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no axillary
lymphadenopathy. Small
axillary lymph nodes do not meet the criteria for pathologic
enlargement and
measure up to 6 mm in size. A large mediastinal mass, which
measures up to
5.4 x 4.7 cm in axial dimension, which extends from the right
paratracheal
region at the level of the thoracic inlet to the precarinal
lesion is present
with central regions of hypodensity suggesting necrotic change.
In addition,
there is an enlarged 4.5 x 2.5 cm subcarinal lymph node.
Bulkiness in the
right hilum is present as well. Evaluation of the central
airways demonstrate
patency to the segmental bronchi bilaterally. Examination of the
lung windows
demonstrate a dominant 13 x 11 mm nodule within the right upper
lobe, with a
satellite lesion in the subpleural right apex measuring 7 mm in
size. Most of
these lesions show some characteristics of spiculation. In
addition, there is
a 5 mm nodular region in the subpleural right lower lobe, which
has well-
defined forbers. The right lower lobe demonstrates mild
atelectasis, possibly
with a smaller degree of consolidation as well. There is a trace
right-sided
pleural effusion. The left lung is essentially clear, without
evidence of
pleural effusion. There are some peripheral blebs suggestive of
paraseptal
emphysema. Note is also made of a hypodense appearance of the
blood relative
to myocardium suggestive of anemia. There is a small pericardial
effusion.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Allowing for the noncontrast
technique,
the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, stomach, and small
bowel appear
unremarkable. The pancreas is grossly unremarkable as well.
Adrenal glands
are not clearly visualized due to the lack of IV contrast, and
no bulky
lymphadenopathy is the retroperitoneum or mesentery is noted.
There is no
abdominal free fluid present.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The large bowel and bladder
are
unremarkable. Distal ureters are not well visualized without IV
contrast. The
uterus is not seen, and the ovaries appear unremarkable.

Examination of the osseous structures show no suspicious lytic
or blastic
lesions.

IMRESSION:
1. Large mediastinal mass with precarinal and subcarinal lymph
nodes. These
have hypodense central regions suggestive or necrosis. These
would be most
ammenable for transbronchial biopsy.
2. Multiple lung nodules, two of which are spiculated at the
right lung apex.
3. There is a small pericardial effusion.

MRI BRAIN.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of cervical cancer
with pulmonary
nodule and mediastinal mass and patient allergic to IV contrast
for CT, for
further evaluation to exclude metastatic disease.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial, and FLAIR, T2 and
susceptibility axial
images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium. T1 axial,
sagittal and
coronal images were obtained following the administration of
gadolinium.

FINDINGS: In the right posterofrontal lobe, there are two small
areas of
signal abnormality seen within on the FLAIR images, one
laterally along the
anterior aspect of the central sulcus and the second superiorly
to the
posterior frontal lobe near the midline. Both of these foci
demonstrate
enhancement following the administration of gadolinium. No other
focal
abnormalities are identified. Specifically, no evidence of
periventricular
signal abnormalities are seen. No other areas of enhancement are
noted. The
ventricles and extraaxial spaces are normal in size. No evidence
for midline
shift, mass effect or hydroce
