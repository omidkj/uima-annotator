Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
cardiogenic shock (transfer from [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
operative IABP placement ([**2159-1-19**])
Cardiac catheterization, tracheostomy tube placement, PEG tube
placement.


History of Present Illness:
73 yoF with PMH HTN, hypothyroid who has been complaining of
"indigestion" since [**9-/2158**] and has been treated with a ppi
without relief.  She reports this as a 15-30 min non-radiating
burning sensation, unrelated to exertion.  She reportedly had a
"normal" stress test at [**Hospital1 2177**] on [**2159-1-12**].  On the night prior to
admission, she had complained of intermittent epigastric pain
which became persistent around 6 PM.
.
Around 5 AM on [**2159-1-16**], she reported to an OSH ED c/o 11 hrs of
epigastric pain.  She had a BP of 191/120, HR 102, Sat 91% on ra
(98% on 2L n.c.), and was afebrile.  An ECG (performed 90
minutes after arrival to ED) showed Q-waves and ST elevations in
V1-V5, she had elevated cardiac enzymes (troponin peak 135, CK
peak 3508) and was taken to an emergent cardiac cath.
[**Date Range **]-cath, she was found to have a R-dominant system, received
a BMS to her proximally-occluded LAD (with resultant TIMI-3
flow) and also was found to have ostial RCA (90% stenosis) and
LCx disease (50% stenosis in OM1 and OM2) which were not
intervened upon at the time.
.
Post-cath, had some episodes of hypoxia and hypotension to 70s.
A post-cath echo showed an EF of [**10-1**]% with
anterior/septal/apical akinesis.  Also of note, she had
persistent tachycardia and "did not tolerate" Lopressor.  She
received digoxin for "inotropic support".  She was assessed to
be "on the cusp of cardiogenic shock" and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for operative placement of LVAD vs IABP placement.
.
[**Hospital1 **]-op, her Swan numbers showed a CVP 20, PAD 25, [**Doctor First Name 1052**] 28, CO
3.1; she had an IABP placed.  An [**Doctor First Name **]-op TEE showed an LVEF of
20-25% with 1+ MR.  On arrival to the CSRU, she had MAP 80, CVP
20, PAD 25, [**Doctor First Name 1052**] 28, CO 3.1.

Gen: sedated, intubated

Extr: cool, 1+ PT pulses, trace bipedal edema
Neuro: sedated


Pertinent Results:
CXR:
[**2-19**] CXR
Tracheostomy tube and left PICC line are in standard position.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There are
worsening bilateral alveolar opacities most prominent in the
central portions of the lungs with relative sparing of the
apices and extreme periphery. This is most likely due to
pulmonary edema particularly given waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course over
serial prior radiographs.

TEE: [**2-7**] ECHO
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.4 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.4 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 3.4 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 40% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2159-1-31**].


LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Apical LV
aneurysm. No LV mass/thrombus. Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size.  There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. No
masses or thrombi are seen in  the left ventricle (echo contrast
given to exclude). Overall left ventricular  systolic function
is mildly depressed. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-1-31**], no
change.

IMPRESSION: No LV thrombus seen.
.
[**2-15**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Prior anteroseptal myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-2-14**] the rate
has slowed and anterolateral ST segment elevation persist.
Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.
.
[**2-7**] MRA head
IMPRESSION: Severely limited study demonstrating absence of flow
signal in the distal left vertebral artery and small basilar
artery which could be secondary to fetal posterior cerebral
arteries. No evidence of vascular occlusion seen in the anterior
circulation. Left posterior cerebral artery is not well
visualized.
.
[**1-26**] Cardiac Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated two
vessel disease.  The LMCA had no angiographically apparent
disease.  The
LAD was mildly calcified and had mild luminal irregularities in
the
proximal section, followed by a widely patent stent; diffuse
disease and
attenuation of the LAD distally. The Cx had 40-50% stenosis in
OM1 and
OM2.The RCA had an ostial 90% lesion and there was diffuse
disease in
the mid to distal segments of the RCA.
2. [**Name (NI) 9927**] PTCA and stenting of the Right coronary artery with
aa 2.5
Cypher DES, post dilated with a 3.0 NC [**Name (NI) 71306**] at the ostium;
three 2.5
Cypher DES in the mid vessel and two 2.0 BMS in the mid to
distal
segment. The final angiogram demonstrated no residual stenosis
with no
angiographic evidence of dissection, embolization or perforation
with
TIMI III flow in the distal vessel.  (See PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. [**Name (NI) 9927**] multi-stent PCI of the RCA.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 73 yo woman with recent anterior MI transferred for
cardiogenic shock, now s/p IABP removal on [**2159-1-21**], s/p stents to
RCA [**2159-1-26**] with VAP s/p trach placement [**2-2**], PEG [**2-4**] and new
acute CVA x2in the setting of hypotensive episodes and L carotid
stenosis.
.
This 73 year old woman was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] after
acute MI initially out of concern for LVAD placement for
cardiogenic shock. On arrival she was found to have
intraoperative CVP 20, PAD 25, [**Doctor First Name 1052**] 28, CO 3.1 so had IABP
placed. LVEF 20-25% with 1+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 71306**] pump was weaned and
removed. Repeat TTE showed improved LVEF 40%. She was initially
attempted to be extubated however shortly afterwards became
stridorous and was reintubated. She was found to have
pseudomonas and MRSA in her sputum and treated with vanco,
ciprofloxacin, and aztreonam. She did not have rapid improvement
and continued to have pseudomonas in her sputum so was
desensitized to meropenem (given allergy to penicillin) and
treated with that for her VAP. Given difficulty extubating and
high RSBI's, she had trach and PEG placed for longterm vent
weaning. For her CAD she underwent cardiac cath on [**2159-1-26**] which
showed 90% RCA lesion that was stented with 2 drug eluting
stents and 4 bare metal stents. Given her allergy to aspirin she
was maintained on 150mg daily of plavix but was desensitized to
aspirin and maintained on 325mg daily with 75mg plavix daily for
her stents.
.
## Pump- Cardiogenic shock on admission; LVEF 40% on
re-evaluation.
- IABP d/c'ed on [**2159-1-21**]; weaned off pressors readily though
blood pressure quite labile and intermittantly requires pressors
for MAP's 40-50
- TEE showed EF 20-25% when rate-controlled; recheck TTE much
improved with LVEF 40%, hypokinesis so heparin d/c'd. Repeat TTE
with echocontrast is negative for mural thrombus however she did
have evidence of apical LV aneurysm which would be an indication
for anticoagulation for 3-6 months. Howev
