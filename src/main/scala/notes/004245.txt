ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum to the Discharge Summary
already dictated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1939**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with regard to the
hospitalization of Yevgnia Sayn.

As documented in the previous Discharge Summary, the patient
was admitted for what was thought at first to be an asthma
exacerbation, although this was proved in fact to be
cardiomyopathy.  This was most likely due to her valvular
disease.

The patient was subsequently kept in the hospital past her
initial anticipated date of discharge as it subsequently
became clear that her discharge disposition and plan were not
entirely clear from a renal perspective, it became clear that
her renal insufficiency, which had bumped from a creatinine
of 0.8 to 1.5 in the span of one day from [**2120-4-4**] to
[**2120-4-5**].  This could not really be explained temporally by
the intravenous contrast that the patient received at
catheterization, nor by her diuresis or ACE inhibitor.

One of the thoughts was that the patient might have in fact
thrown an embolus from her atrial fibrillation, which was
previously untreated, to her renal artery, subsequently
blocking off one of her kidneys.  However, a renal ultrasound
was done which did not show a big difference in size between
the two kidneys, arguing against that.  An MRA of the renal
arteries to better delineate the flow to the kidneys, however
she declined this.

From a diabetic standpoint, the patient had been controlled
before she came in on Glynase and metformin alone.  During
the hospitalization, the patient's blood sugars were
increased, most likely secondary to the prednisone taper that
she got because of what was thought at first to be an asthma
exacerbation.  When her renal insufficiency became acute, her
metformin was discontinued as well.

[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted with regard to her diabetic management
with a specific question of whether or not she should be on
insulin and, if so, how to best go about this.  After
observing the patient on just regular insulin sliding scale
for a few days, it became clear that her blood sugars were
starting to come down after she finished her prednisone
taper.  In addition, although her blood sugars were still
elevated in the mid to high 100s with some readings in the
low 200s, some thought was given to the fact that the patient
would be more active at home, therefore lowering her blood
sugar.  Therefore, the patient was sent home on just Glynase
6 mg b.i.d. rather than on an insulin regimen, and she will
be followed up with [**Last Name (un) **] to figure out optimal management
for her diabetes.

From a hematological perspective, the patient was
anticoagulated secondary to her history of atrial
fibrillation and her low ejection fraction of 20%.  The time
to get her INR therapeutic took longer than expected, however
it did finally become therapeutic on the day prior to her
discharge.

Two days prior to her discharge, the patient apparently fell,
although no one did see the fall.  She did not lose
consciousness and was not complaining initially of any pain
anywhere.  However, on the day after her fall the patient did
complain of pain in her left big toe and indeed on
examination the patient did have a swollen, ecchymotic toe
with decreased range of motion.  An x-ray did in fact reveal
a fracture in the mid and distal portions of the proximal
phalanx of the left big toe.

The Orthopedic Service was asked to come in and evaluate her.
They eventually deferred evaluation to the Podiatry service.
After the Podiatry Service had taken a look at the x-ray
determined that the fracture did not go into the joint space
and that she should be okay to be put in a Darby boot and to
be evaluated on an outpatient basis.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with her primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**], on [**2120-4-25**] at 9:45 AM.  The patient
also had a follow up appointment with her podiatrist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], also on [**2120-4-25**] at 3 PM.  In addition, the
patient had a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the
