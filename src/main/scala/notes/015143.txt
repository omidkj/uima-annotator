Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, hypoxia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with HIV, CKD, anemia, critical aortic stenosis,
peripheral neuropathy, and G6PD deficiency who is being admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for dyspnea and hypoxia. She was at a scheduled
outpatient CT scan, where she appeared short of breath and
complained of dyspnea, which was significantly worsened when the
patient lied flat on the CT scanner table. She has had steadily
worsening dyspnea over the last 2-3 weeks, which has
occasionally been accompanied by a productive cough. She was
referred to the ED, where her triage SpO2 was reported as 50%
and her RR was in the 40s. She was initially unresponsive, but
her oxygen saturation and her mental status improved with a
non-rebreather and nebulizer treatments. She had a chest x-ray
that was reportedly concerning for pneumonia. She was given
vancomycin, pip/tazo, azithromycin, and furosemide 80 mg IV. ID
was consulted, and recommended obtaining urine legionella,
bacterial/fungal blood cultures, sputum gram stain & culture,
influenza swab, and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient reports that her dyspnea is
significantly improved since this afternoon. She reports that
her dyspnea had been worsening over the past 2-3 weeks, and she
has also had an occasional wheeze for the past one week. She has
also had worsening bilateral ankle edema over that same period
of time. She denies coughing, hemoptysis, chest pain or
pressure, fevers, chills, sweats, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, or changes in bowel or bladder habits. She also
reports she had a similar episode last [**Month (only) 116**], for which she was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]. Discharge summary indicates that she was
treated with diuresis and levofloxacin, for CAP. During that
same admission, she had a CT scan showing right hilar and
precarinal lymphadenopathy, with narrowing of the bronchus
intermedius by adjacent lymph nodes.

Past Medical History:
-HIV (CD4 247, VL nondetectable in [**11/2193**]) on HAART

Social History:
Lives with daughter in [**Name (NI) 2624**]. No pets. Retired. Used to work at
[**Hospital1 18**]. Her daughter [**Name (NI) **] is also very involved. Pt lives with
her daughter. She walks with a cane outside and with a walker in
the house. She smoked for 4 years, 3 cigarettes a day when she
was younger. She drinks ETOH occasionally in social situations
but does not use any drugs. She is widowed for 10 years, and she
contracted HIV from a man she dated 10 years ago. She has a
visiting nurse who comes by 1 time a week and a care giver who
comes by for 2 hours multiple days per week.

Pertinent Results:
.
Micro:
[**2194-1-16**] Influenza A/B by DFA:
DIRECT INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2194-1-17**]): Negative for
Influenza A
DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2194-1-17**]): Negative for
Influenza B
.
[**2194-1-15**] urine legionella negative
[**2194-1-15**] blood cultures negative
[**2194-1-15**] urine culture negative
.
Imaging:
[**2194-1-15**] CT chest without contrast: 1. New pulmonary edema and
small left pleural effusion. 2. Severely limited assessment of
persistent left lower lobe fissural nodule due to inadvertent
expiratory phase of respiration and respiratory motion. This
nodule could be reassessed in [**2194-5-18**] as originally
recommended.  3. Tracheomalacia, with over 70% narrowing of
tracheal lumen on inadvertent expiratory CT acquisition. 4.
Probable pulmonary arterial hypertension.
.
[**2194-1-15**] CXR: The cardiomediastional shilouette and hila are
normal.
Compared to the prior exam, there is new mild cardiomegaly and
small mild new pulmonary edema. Trace left effusion. No
pneumothorax.
.
[**2194-1-16**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Diastolic function
could not be assessed. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate
([**1-19**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of aortic regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Biventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Critical calcific aortic
stenosis with mild to moderate regurgitation. At least mild
mitral regurgitation. Severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-5-2**],
the degree of pulmonary hypertension has increased. The degrees
of aortic and mitral regurgitation have probably increased also.
The other findings are similar.
.
[**2194-1-16**] CXR: Previous heterogeneous pulmonary opacification is
largely cleared, consistent with resolving edema. Small residual
in the right lower lobe should be followed to exclude pneumonia.
Borderline cardiomegaly stable. Pleural effusion, minimal on the
left, if any. No pneumothorax.
