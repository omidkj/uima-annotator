History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
47 year old man with cirrhosis (EtOh, hep C), ESRD on HD, with
altered mental status. He was recently discharged ([**10-16**]) for
transplant surgery after hospital stay for umbilical hernia
weeping complicated by anaphylactic arrest after iv vitamin K.
He was admitted with altered mental status on [**10-19**] after missing
dialysis and notably taking dilaudid and tylenol at home for
pain. No f/c/n/v at home.  In the ED VS: T 97.4, HR 80 BP 113/43
RR 16 O2Sat 96% 2L (89% RA).  He became unresponsive during a
head CT in the ED and was therefore admitted to the MICU. It was
presumed that his altered mental status was due to a combination
of narcotics, missing HD, and non-compliance with lactulose.  He
was treated with naloxone and lactulose with improvement in
mental status.  He was also started on ceftriaxone for empiric
SBP treatment (pt has had an elevated WBC count but no fever).
An US-guided beside paracentesis was attempted but aborted [**2-17**]
loops of bowel moving in front of the needle and he was dialyzed
with 2.4L off.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] also complains of wheezing and chronic cough.  He
does report history of asthma for which he uses and albuterol
inhaler.  Of note he did have an anaphylactic reaction to IV vit
K on last hospitalization requiring chest compressions.
.
ROS: He notes dry mouth; denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, BRBPR, hematemesis, dysuria.  He feels much better today
with no complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 47 year old man with cirrhosis, admitted with
altered mental status with periods of apnea, hyponatremia, CKD
on HD, thrmobocytopenia, anemia.
.
# Altered mental staus: Likely secondary to dilaudid and
lactulose noncompliance in the setting of renal failure and
hepatic failure. Improved with naloxone, dialysis, and
lactulose.  Other possible causes on the DDx include SBP, so a
radiology-guided paracentesis was performed, which showed no
evidence of SBP.  On the night of [**10-22**] pt complaining of
insomnia and was given ambien, and pt was lethargic for much of
the following morning.  In the future all sedating medications
should be avoided since pt's compromised liver function will
cause high levels and could precipitate worsening
encephelopathy.  On [**10-22**] the pt signed out AMA, before either PT
or Social work could see him. Discussed with patient risks of
leaving, in particular the risks of cardiac arrhythmias from not
receiving dialysis on a regular basis, worsening of liver
failure and encephalopathy, and hydronephrosis from urinary
retention. Patient stated his understanding and appeared to have
competency and decision making
capacity. Patient signed AMA paperwork prior to discharge. Foley
catheter removed. Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# Liver failure: LFT's around baseline, coags mildly elevated.
Continued nadolol, rifaxamin, lactulose, folate, thiamine.
.
# Pleuritic chest pain: likely from chest compressions + asthma.
Given nebs with improvement.  AP&Lat CXR showed only bibasilar
atelectasis.
.
# Acidemia on admission: resolved; probably from ESRD +
respiratory depression
.
# Positive UA: No complaints of dysuria but elevated WBC count,
so pt started on CTX on admission.  When culture with >100K
yeast ABX were d/ced and no antifungals started because likely
represents colonization of foley in pt with low urine output [**2-17**]
ESRD.  Elevated WBC count appears to be chronic on OMR.
.
# Urinary retention: After pt had foley catheter removed
following MICU stay there was some concern for urinary retention
because bedside bladder scan showed 700 cc urine.  Straight
catheter and foley catheter were attempted to be placed, but
without return of urine, so balloon was no filled and catheters
were removed.  Due to concern for urinary retention Urology was
called, who placed a foley catheter with little urine return.
they felt that bladder scan results were likly [**2-17**] artifact from
ascites, and that pt infact did not have urinary retention.
Urology recommended an Abdominal US to evaluate foley placement
and bladder distention, but pt signed out AMA before this could
be performed.  The risks of urniary retention were explained to
him, and he accepted these risks.
.
# Umbilical Hernia: No further weeping, easily reducible, no new
issues.
.
# Hyponatremia on admission: Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
Recent baseline high 120's-low 130's, resolved during hospital
stay with discharge Na = 134.
.
# Chronic Kidney Disease: Pt missed dialysis before admission,
which likely co
