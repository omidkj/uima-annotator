Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
81M PMH R CVA x2, laryngeal cancer s/p laryngectomy, question
PAF who presented to OSH after syncope x 2 at home. The history
was obtained from the patient and his domestic partner. The
patient had two episodes of syncope the morning of admission
following coughing episodes. The patient has had an increasing
number of falls after coughing episodes and has been followed by
his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient has had increased secretions over the past
few months. The patient complains of preceding dizziness for > 5
seconds but denies palpitations, tongue biting, bladder or bowel
incontinence. The patient was intially seen at [**Hospital **] Hospital,
where CT head showed acute on chronic bilateral SDH. The
patient's C-spine was cleared by report at the OSH. OSH labs
were significant for minimally elevated CK 185 with negative
troponin I and WBC 11.2 with 3% bandemia. The patient was a
given tetanus booster and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, VS 98.4 96 198/101 20 98%2L. The patient was seen by
neurosurgery and plastic surgery. Repeat CT head showed acute on
chronic bilateral subdural hemorrhages, likely subarachnoid but
possibly intraparenchymal blood in the high right frontal lobe,
and right orbital wall fractures. The patient's right orbital
laceration was repaired. The decision was made to admit to
medicine for monitoring of SDH and further syncope work-up. The
patient was given morphine 2 mg IV x 2, labetolol 10 mg IV x 2,
labetolol 100 mg PO x 1.
.
On arrival, the patient complained of mild right orbital pain.
He denies focal neurologic symptoms, loss of vision, fevers,
chills. Review of systems otherwise negative in detail.


Past Medical History:
1. Cerebrovascular accidents [**2115**], [**2116**] with minimal left hand
residual deficit; question now unused tracheostomy after CVA
versus after laryngectomy

EKG: ST at 102. Axis +90, same as previous. Normal intervals. No
ST-T changes.

CT Orbit/Sella/IAC ([**8-20**]):IMPRESSION:
1. Minimally displaced fractures of the right superior and
medial orbital wall with herniation of fat into the defects, but
no evidence of muscular herniation at this time. No intracoronal
abnormalities. No evidence of globe rupture. Soft tissue
swelling over the right eye and face. Aid-fluid level in the
right frontal air cell and opacification of multiple ethmoid air
cells.
2. Middle ear opacification on the left with slight asymmetry of
the nasopharynx, left more prominent than right. Direct
visualization is recommended.

CT Head w/o Contrast ([**8-20**])
1. Acute on chronic bilateral subdural hemorrhages.
2. Likely subarachnoid but possibly intraparenchymal blood in
the high right frontal lobe.
3. Right orbital wall fractures, which are detailed in the CT of
the orbits done the same day.

Carotid Series ([**8-21**])
IMPRESSION: Likely occlusion of right carotid system. On the
left there is moderate plaque with a 40-59% carotid stenosis.
Based on these findings _____ clinical correlation and CTA or
MRA evaluation is warranted.

Echo ([**8-21**]): Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis
(LVEF = 45-50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no left
ventricular
outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right ventricular
chamber size  and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly  thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR ([**8-25**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-21**],
there is little change. Bilateral apical pleural capping and
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again seen. No evidence
of acute pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Acute on chronic SDH: CT head showed acute on chronic
bilateral subdural hemorrhages. Likely subarachnoid but possibly
intraparenchymal blood in the high right frontal lobe, Right
orbital wall fractures, which are detailed in the CT of the
orbits done the same day.  Patient cleared by neurosurgery,
initially admitted to MICU but transferred to floor. No
concerning signs or symptoms on exam. Goal SBP for patient was
120-140 for permissive hypertension, yet patient was on
Metoprolol 25 mg PO bid while in the hospital with SBP ranging
from 120s-170s.  The patient's Plavix was held for 1 week, and
was restarted on [**8-28**]. No operative intervention advised,
patient will follow-up in neurosurgery [**Month/Year (2) **] in one month with
head CT.
.
# Orbital fractures: Patient seen by plastic surgery and
laceration repaired. Ophthalmology consulted, no surgical
intervention advised. Patient to complete 7 day course of
Keflex. Sutures removed prior to discharge.
.
# Syncope: Likely situational syncope occuring in context of
cough. Some concern for arrhythmia given the patient did not
protect his face on falling. EKG unrevealing. Patient was
monitored on telemetry during his stay on no concerning
arrhythmia alarms. Patient at risk for seizures given prior CVA
but no signs or symptoms of seizure activity. Unlikely TIA.
Carotid ultrasound showed unchanged complete RCA stenosis, but
no new pathology.
.
# Dyspnea: Patient with long-standing smoking history and
1-month history of cough. Patient with stoma secondary to
laryngectomy. CXR showed apical pleural capping. Dyspnea
improved with nebulizer treatments. Likely [**1-3**] underlying COPD,
will need continued outpatient monitoring and PFTs. No focal
consolidations seen on imaging. N
