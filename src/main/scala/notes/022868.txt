ADDENDUM - HOSPITAL COURSE:  Please note, this dictation
covers the patient's hospitalization from approximately
[**2147-1-4**] until the date of discharge.  For his
previous hospitalization, please see the previously dictated
discharge summary.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 66-year-old man, with diabetes,
peripheral vascular disease, CVA, who was admitted [**2146-12-9**]
with persistent necrotic right heel ulcer to vascular
surgery.  On [**2146-12-15**], he underwent angioplasty with stents x
3 to the right superficial femoral artery, but was
subsequently transferred to the podiatry service for right
heel debridement and calcanectomy on [**12-27**].  Pathologic
exam and microbiologic data revealed acute on chronic
osteomyelitis with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
epidermidis and Corynebacterium.

The patient initially did well postoperatively, but on
[**12-30**] developed shortness of breath, cough with white
sputum, a low-grade fever, orthopnea, and paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, as well as a new hypoxemia.  Chest x-rays
revealed a new infiltrate that was either CHF versus
pneumonia.  The pulmonary team was consulted and recommended
diuresis.  The patient continued with an O2 requirement and
he was, therefore, transferred to the [**Hospital6 16326**]
on [**1-4**].

On [**1-6**], he developed increasing shortness of breath
with a PAO2 of 50 on 100% nonrebreather.  He was given lasix
80 IV x 3 without effect, and he was placed on mask
ventilation and transferred to the Medical ICU.  The patient
was successfully diuresed 5-1/2 liters with significant
improvement in his hypoxemia.  Initially, his antibiotic
coverage was broadened to include Levofloxacin, vancomycin
and Zosyn, though Levofloxacin and Zosyn were subsequently
discontinued per ID recommendations, given that sputum
cultures remained negative.  The vancomycin was continued for
his right foot osteomyelitis.  Given the patient's improved
respiratory status, he was transferred back to the medicine
[**Hospital1 139**] service on [**2147-1-12**].

1) OSTEOMYELITIS:  The patient is status post partial
calcanectomy of his right heel with acute on chronic
osteomyelitis.  He will need to continue vancomycin for 6
weeks postsurgery, which will be through [**2147-2-16**].
Additionally, he is to continue nonweightbearing to his right
heel until he follows up with the podiatry service and they
clear him for weightbearing status.

2) HYPOXEMIA:  The patient continued to improve during his
hospital course, and on the day of discharge was satting well
on room air.  The most likely etiology of his hypoxemia was
related to congestive heart failure, although his underlying
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may also have
contributed.  For his heart failure, he will continue his
beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.  Additionally, to help
control his volume, he will continue on a low dose of lasix
that may need to be further adjusted as an outpatient.

3) DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient's sugars were quite
brittle during his hospital stay and rather difficult to
control especially with his varying intake with the
reintroduction of tube feeds as supplements for his
nutrition, given his poor nutritional status.  His NPH and
sliding scales will likely need further adjustment carefully,
as the patient had some trouble with some early morning
hypoglycemia.  This will need to continue to be monitored
carefully, as his tube feeds are tapered as his PO intake
improves.

4) GI:  The patient has a history of chronic dysphagia of
unclear etiology for which he is followed by his outpatient
gastroenterologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  An EGD performed while in
the hospital revealed esophageal dysmotility, but no other
abnormal findings, and no clear etiologic cause.
Additionally, the patient had been having chronic diarrhea
for several months.  Stool studies were sent and were
negative for infectious etiologies.  Additionally, a tissue
transglutaminase was negative.  However, the patient did have
the presence of some stool fat on exam suggesting the
possibility of malabsorption.  This will need to be further
addressed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

5) HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was noted to have a chronic but
stable anemia while he was in the hospital.  B12 and folate
were normal.  Iron studies were consistent with anemia of
chronic disease.  Currently, his hematocrit is stable.  As an
outpatient, he might benefit from starting Epogen.

6) DEPRESSION:  The patient had profound fatigue and somewhat
low mood while he was in the hospital and was followed by our
psychiatry consult service.  They recommended stopping his
SSRI and starting the patient on Ritalin which was done
successfully.  The patient's energy and appetite did improve
somewhat while he was on the Ritalin, and this is to be
continued as an outpatient.  Additionally, he would likely
benefit from psychiatric follow-up as an outpatient.

7) NUTRITION:  The patient came in with chronic malnutrition
and decreased muscle mass.  While in the hospital, he was
begun on tube feeds due to concerns that the patient was
aspirating while he was in the MICU.  Subsequent evaluation
by speech and swallow therapists revealed that he had no
signs or symptoms of aspiration, and he was encouraged to
return to eating PO.  However, he reports decreased appetite
and; therefore, it was decided to restart supplemental tube
feeds to increase his nutritional state.  This will need to
be followed up while he is at rehab with calorie counts to
assess how he is eating now that his appetite has been
improved with the Ritalin, as the tube feeds may need to be
tapered.  If tube feeds are tapered, then his insulin will
need to be adjusted to reflect that.

8) PHYSICAL THERAPY:  The patient is currently
nonweightbearing to his right heel until he is cleared by
podiatry.  Additionally, due to his prolonged hospital course
he is significantly weak and requires assistance with
mobility, as noted in the physical therapy page three
referral.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Improved.  The patient breathes
comfortably on room air.  The surgical incision is healing
well.  He requires assistance with mobility, as the patient
is nonweightbearing to the right foot until he follows up
with podiatry.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To a skilled nursing facility.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient needs to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
of podiatry in [**6-17**] days.  He is to call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4335**] to
schedule an appointment.  He is not to put weight on his
right heel until he sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
2. The patient is also to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3845**] within 1
week of leaving rehab.  He is to call his office at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 16327**] for an appointment.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3845**] will follow-up on
the patient's anemia and consider starting Epogen.
Additionally, he will also assess the patient's nutritional
status and his volume status.
3. The patient would also likely benefit from a follow-up
with psyc
