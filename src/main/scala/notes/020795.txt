History of Present Illness:
69 yo man with known coronary artery disease and systolic heart
failure who has had progressive symptoms of heart failure,
including increasing exertional dyspnea, over the past couple of
months.  1-2 weeks ago his dose of furosemide was increased to
40 mg daily due to new, progressive lower extremity edema.  On
the night of [**5-25**], he was awakened from sleep with severe dyspnea
in the setting of dietary indiscretion earlier that night.  It
was associated with substernal chest discomfort that was not
relieved by belching; he also had nausea without emesis.  He
presented to an OSH where he was found to be in atrial
fibrillation with ST segment depressions V4-V6 on his initial
EKG; his second troponin returned at 7.68.  He was treated with
heparin gtt, eptifibatide gtt, ASA, metoprolol, and clopidogrel.
 He also received furosemide IV for treatment of congestive
heart failure with effective diuresis.  He spontaneously
converted to sinus rhythm early in his hospital course and has
remained in sinus since.  He was transferred here for cath given
his NSTEMI.

Past Medical History:
1. CAD s/p MI x3
2. systolic heart failure (EF 25-30%)
3. hypertension
4. dyslipidemia
5. diabetes mellitus type II since [**2115**]
6. tobacco abuse
7. atrial fibrillation
8. left nephrectomy [**2068**]

Social History:
Smokes one pack of cigarettes daily. Drinks 2-3 beers nightly.
No illicit drug use. Married, lives with his wife. Retired [**Name2 (NI) 2318**]
employee.

Family History:
Brother died of sudden cardiac death from an MI.  Sister age 79
recently had an MI.  Father died of "a bad heart."  Mother died
at 81 from "old age."

U/A: trace protein, trace LE, o/w negative

EKG (initial): atrial fibrillation at roughly 150 beats per
minute, normal axis, 1-2 mm ST segment depressions V4-V6

EKG ([**5-27**]): normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute, normal
axis, normal intervals, 0.5-1 mm ST segment depressions V4-V6, T
wave flattening I and aVL

OSH TTE (per report): EF 25-30%, multiple regional WMA

[**2130-5-29**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound
Mild to moderate plaque in the bilateral internal carotid
arteries, right worse than left. This is associated with
diameter reductions between 40 and 59% in diameter in the right
internal carotid artery and less than 40% in diameter in the
left internal carotid artery. Antegrade flow in the bilateral
vertebral arteries

[**2130-5-29**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a left dominant
system with
three vessel coronary artery disease. The short calcified LMCA
had a 50%
proximal taper. The diffusely calcified LAD had serial 90%
lesions
proximally with a normal distal vessel. The dominant LCX had
extensive
calcification with a 90% lesion at the origin of the OM2 and
LPDA with
no angiographically apparent flow limiting lesions distally.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderately elevated right
sided
(mean RA 21 mmHg), pulmonary (mean PA 28 mm Hg) and left sided
pressures
(mean PCWP 21 mmHg) with no gradient upon movement of the
catheter from
the ventricle to the aorta. The cardiac index was moderately
depressed
(1.9 l/min/m2).
3. Left ventriculography was deferred for high left sided
pressures.

[**2130-5-29**] ECHO
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate
global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Inferior akinesis is present. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is
seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 106768**] was admitted to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Medical
Center on [**2130-5-28**] for further management of his myocardial
infarction. A cardiac catheterization was performed which
revealed a 50% stenosed left main, a 90% stenosed left anterior
descending artery, a 90% stenosed circumflex artery and an
occluded right coronary artery. Due to the severity of his
disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical
revascularization. A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed
which revealed a 40-59% stenosed right and less then a 40%
stenosed left internal carotid artery. An echocardiogram was
performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 30-35%, mild 1+
mitral regurgitation, [**12-25**]+ tricuspid regurgitation and a mildly
dilated left atrium. On [**2130-5-30**], Mr. [**Known lastname 106768**] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to two vessels. Postoperatively he was taken to the
cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On
postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 106768**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact
and was extubated. Amiodarone and coumadin were started given
his preoperative atrial fibrillation. He was then transferred to
the cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. Mr.
[**Known lastname 106768**] was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. His drains and pacing wires
were removed per protocol. The [**Last Name (un) 387**] diabetes service was
consulted for assistance with his diabetes medication
management. As his sugars were elevated, insulin was started.
Mr. [**Known lastname 106769**] INR was markedly elevated on postoperative day 5
and as he remained in normal sinus rhythm, it was decided to
discontinue his coumadin and amiodarone. Vitamin K was given
with good effect. As Mr. [**Known lastname 106769**] blood pressure remained low,
it was elected to wait until his blood pressure improved prior
to starting an ace-inhibitor. Thus, an ace-inhibitor should be
started as an outpatient given his low ejection fraction and
preoperative myocardial infarction. Mr. [**Known lastname 106768**] continued to
make steady progress and was discharged to [**Hospital **] Health Care
Rehabilitation on postoperative day eight. he will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1637**] as an outpatient.
