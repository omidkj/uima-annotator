History of Present Illness:
Please see the nightfloat admission note [**2200-7-4**] for full
details. In short, this is a 38 M with EtOH abuse presenting
from home with altered mental status and pneumonia. The patient
recently moved back to the USA after being layed off from a
pharmaceutical company in Europe and established medical care
here. After a discussion in early [**Month (only) **], has apparently not had a
drink for 2 weeks. Yesterday night he was confused at home,
intermittently A&Ox3 and at other times making bizarre comments,
but brought in by EMS after falling at home. Of note, he was
recently treated with Levaquin for suspected pneumonia, and has
been having both blood-tinged sputum and blood-streaked
diarrhea.
.
Labs on admission notable for lactate of 2.9 (for which he
received 2 L of IVFs), Cre of 1.3 with a gap of 19, NH4 of 15,
AST of 240, ALT of 192, Tbili of 3.8, INR of 1.8. WBC of 10, Hct
of 44, Plts of 196, MCV high normal of 98, but with occasinional
schistocytes on RBC morphology (automated). The pt underwent RUQ
U/S which showed trace peri-hepatic, peri-splenic ascites, no
focal liver findings, and no acute cholecysitis, a Head CT with
?low hanging cerebellar tonsils versus artifact, and a CXR which
confirmed a PNA and ?L pleural effusion. The pt received
Vancomycin, CFTX, Azithromycin (first 2 abx for emperic
meningitis coverage) and thiamine 100 mg PO x1.
.
On the floor overnight, patient became increasingly somnolent.
He recieved several doses of valium overnight for presumed
withdrawl.  This morning, he became increasingly tachypneic to
30 and tachycardic to 120s-130s.  He maintained adequate sats on
room air.  Lactate had also increased from 2.9 to 3.3.  CXR also
may have signs of possible abscess.  ID consult was obtained and
patient was transferred to the ICU for concern for developing
SIRS/Sepsis.
.
Patient reports stopping drinking two weeks ago, followed by
some tremulousness and headaches. He has felt unwell for 3 weeks
or so with persistent cough. Has also had intermittent diarrhea
and brown urine. Denies vomiting. Denies dysuria. Other ROS
negative.

Past Medical History:
1. Gout.
2. Non-hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed at age 2, treated with
several years of chemotherapy. Apparently had ? liver recurrence
at age 6, but liver biopsy showed only scarring.
3. Elevated LFTs on recent lab work at [**Hospital1 2025**].
4. Hyperlipidemia.
5. Alcoholism since his 20s. Always been very functional,
working full time job. No history of withdrawal or rehab.


Social History:
The patient lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 86**]. They are monogamous.
He has no concerns for STD at this time. He has no children. He
works for a pharmaceutical development company. The patient
reports drinking quite a bit alcohol, which includes five
glasses of wine or beer each night seven nights a week for at
least 8 years, likely more. He does realize he needs to cut
down, as we discussed this at length today, and he seems willing
to do so. He has 'the shakes' only for the first 5 days when he
stops drinking. Denies blackouts, seizure activity, or
hallucinations when he stops drinking. Denies any history of
drug use. He smokes one to two cigarettes daily with alcohol.

Family History:
History of diabetes in his father, history of asthma in his
grandfather. [**Name (NI) **] history of early MI, malignancy, or stroke.

- ECG: ([**7-11**]) Ectopic atrial rhythm. Low limb lead voltage. Late
R wave progression with Q waves in leads V1-V2. Consider septal
myocardial infarction. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the
previous tracing of [**2200-7-4**] the rate is slower. Atrial mechanism
has changed, no longer sinus rhythm. ST-T wave abnormalities may
be less.
.
- ECHO: ([**7-7**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF<15%). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-19**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears loculated.
IMPRESSION: Severe global biventricular hypokinesis. Dilated
right ventricle. Depressed cardiac index. Moderate tricuspid and
mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation. Small loculated posterior
per
