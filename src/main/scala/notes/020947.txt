History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 57554**] is a 79 year old man with a medical history
notable for atrial fibrillation on coumadin, severe aortic
regurgitation s/p bioprosthetic AVR on [**6-27**], PCKD s/p cadaveric
renal transplant in [**2155**], and diverticulosis noted in [**2174**], who
presents from his nursing home with 5 episodes of BRBPR over the
past 2 days. The patient underwent an uncomplciated AVR on [**6-27**]
and was discharged on ASA/coumadin. He had been doing well at
his nursing home until [**7-14**], 1 day PTA, when he had diarrhea
with BRBPR throughout the night. He denied abdominal pain,
nausea, and vomiting. He had one episode of dizziness but denied
presyncope or syncope. The BRBPR continued until the morning. He
was transferred to the ED.

In the ED, initial VS were: HR 86, 122/72. He denied
nausea/vomiding and abdominal pain. On exam, he had BRB in
rectal vault. His labs were notable for a HCT of 31 (at
baseline), Cr 1.3 (baseline 1.6), and an NTproBNP of [**Numeric Identifier 101333**].
During his ED stay, his HR increased to 110 and his SBP
decreased to 110. Cardiac surgery was curbsided and recommended
vitamin K and 2U FFP. They cautioned against giving fluid
boluses.


Past Medical History:
- Moderate-to-severe aortic insufficiency with dilated LV (LVEF
50-55%), s/p bioprosthetic AVR on [**2182-6-27**]
- Recent cardiac catheterization showing no obstructive
coronary artery disease, however, found to have elevated filling
pressures, requiring diuresis
- Atrial fibrillation, currently on Coumadin for
thromboembolic prophylaxis
- Hypertension
- Kidney transplant in [**2155**] due to PCKD, the baseline
creatinine approximately 1.6
- Hyperlipidemia
- Peripheral neuropathy
- Diverticulitis
- Pseudogout
- Osteoporosis


Social History:
Patient previously worked as an engineer for channel 5. He
currently lives in a house himself. His wife passed away 9 years

ago. Prior history of 3 ppd X 20 years, quitting 34 years ago.
Occasional ETOH (few beers per week). No illicits. His daughters

([**Doctor First Name **] (daughter) - ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 101330**], [**Female First Name (un) **] (daughter)
[**0-0-**]) are very involved.

sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.

TTE [**2182-7-19**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a moderate
sized circumferential pericardial effusion without signs of
tamponade physiology.

IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Normally-functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion.

[**7-22**] echo
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40%).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. The effusion is echo
dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular
elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-7-19**], the
findings are similar. On both echoes, there is a moderate
circumferential pericardial effusion. There is no clear-cut
evidence of tamponade physiology on either echo. Mitral valve
and tricuspid valve inflows show variability which is partly due
to atrial fibrillation.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo M with a PMHx of moderate to severe AI with decreased EF
s/p bioprosthetic AVR [**2182-6-27**] and discharged to rehab on [**7-2**] on
coumadin and ASA, AF, HTN, renal transplant [**2155**] [**1-17**] to PCKD and
diverticulitis noted on c-scope in [**2174**] who p/f rehab with BRBPR
who was intially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation and sent
to the floor when showed no signs of clinical bleeding, course
c/b AF with RVR, moderate sized pericardial effusion and c.
difficile colitis
.
# LGI BLEED:
GI bleeding resolved spontaneously.  We suspect that this was
likely a diverticular bleed given his known diverticuli.  No
colonoscopy done this admission.

# C. dificile colitis
Patient and family endorse months to years of intermitent
mucousy output from h
