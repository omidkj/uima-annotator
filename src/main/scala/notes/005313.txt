Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female, with a past medical history significant for atrial
fibrillation, status post AV ablation and pacemaker
placement, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 35%, and hypertension, who presents with a 2-day history
of fever, cough, nasal discharge.  On the day prior to
admission, she also developed an nonproductive cough.  She
denies dyspnea or chest discomfort.  She denies headaches,
dizziness, abdominal pain, dysuria, or diarrhea.

The patient was brought to the Emergency Room where her
vitals were 100.9.  She had a blood pressure of 92/32, and a
O2 saturation of 80% on room air which improved to 95% on 4
liters.  She had a chest x-ray done in the Emergency
Department which showed pulmonary edema and a right middle
lobe infiltrate which was consistent with a community
acquired pneumonia.  She received azithromycin and
ceftriaxone, and for her low blood pressure she received IV
fluids.

VITALS ON ADMISSION TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT:  Temperature
100.9, blood pressure 92/31, heart rate 70, respiratory rate
26, satting 87% on room air which responded to 95% on 4
liters.

side halfway up.
CARDIAC EXAM:  Regular.  Normal S1, S2.  No murmurs.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  She has no edema.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 14.2, hematocrit
34.7, platelets 127.  Chem-7 - sodium 137, potassium 3.8,
chloride 100, bicarb 23, BUN 18, creatinine 0.9, glucose 167.
She had normal coags.  She had a lactate of 2.8.  LFTs were
normal.  Her dig level was 1.0.  She had a UA which was
clean.  EKG - paced.  Chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe
infiltrate and pulmonary edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for community
acquired pneumonia.  She was started on azithromycin and
ceftriaxone for her community acquired pneumonia.  Her
initial low blood pressure responded to IV fluids, with a
blood pressure the next day of 120/56.  Her O2 sats remained
stable on the first day of 100% on 2 liters.

On the night of hospital day #1, the patient did have
respiratory distress and was sent to the intensive care unit.
It was thought that this was secondary to flash pulmonary
edema, and she was diuresed, her respiratory status was
stabilized on CPAP, and she responded to standing albuterol,
Atrovent nebulizers.  Blood cultures were drawn at that time,
as well, which showed no growth.

As the patient's respiratory status was stabilized with
diuresis, the patient was transferred back to the floor after
1 day in the intensive care unit.  Back on the floor, the
patient had another episode of respiratory distress where she
had an O2 sat of 87% on 4 liters.  It was thought again that
this was secondary to flash pulmonary edema, and she was
transferred back to the medical intensive care unit for
management.  There, she received further diuresis and
required BiPAP for her respiratory function.  She tolerated
the BIPAP well, and the patient's cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1104**],
was called to evaluate the patient.  Also, the patient did
have a brief episode of hypotension in the intensive care
unit which did require, for a short period of time, a
dopamine drip which she was weaned off quickly.

The patient also did have some thrombocytopenia while in the
medical intensive care unit with platelets as low as 81.  HIT
antibody was sent which was negative, and her
thrombocytopenia resolved spontaneously.

The patient did receive a CT of the chest which showed just
some small bilateral pleural effusion and dependent
atelectasis.  There were also patchy ground-glass opacities
throughout the lungs with slight upper zone predominance.
This was consistent with her pulmonary edema and her
pneumonia which was being treated.

The patient also received an echocardiogram which showed an
ejection fraction of 45%.  There were some left ventricular
wall motion abnormalities which included akinesis of the
inferolateral wall.  There was also 1+ aortic regurg, 1+
mitral regurg, and 1+ tricuspid regurg.  There were no
pericardial effusions.

The patient did require continued BIPAP on and off while in
the medical intensive care unit.  However, once her
respiratory status there was stabilized, she was called back
out to the floor again.  She completed her 5-day course of
azithromycin, and she received 12 days of IV ceftriaxone.
She will complete a full 14-day course of a third generation
cephalosporin with transitioning to PO cefpodoxime as an
outpatient.

The patient on the floor required BIPAP for only 1 night.
However, on the previous 2 nights prior to admission, she did
not require BIPAP.  Her pulmonary functioning continued to
improve, and a repeat chest x-ray showed improved pulmonary
edema and just continued opacification on the right side
which was consistent with her pneumonia.  The patient did
receive chest physical therapy, and was evaluated by the
physical therapy services who recommended rehab placement.

To work-up her recurrent flash pulmonary edema which required
unit stay, cardiology and the primary medical team decided to
work-up ischemia as a possible etiology.  She did receive a
Persantine-MIBI which showed only a fixed defect in the base
of the inferior wall.  There were no reversible perfusion
defects.  Ultimately, we did not have a clear reason for the
patient's flash pulmonary edema episodes here.  It is likely
a confluence of multiple medical factors, including her
underlying pneumonia and already compromised cardiac function
with the ejection fraction of 45%, and akinesis of the
inferior wall of her left ventricle.  However, the patient
did improve with her antibiotics and chest physical therapy.
Her oxygen requirement was weaned down.  She was satting 97%
on room air on the day of discharge.  Her platelets, as
mentioned, returned to [**Location 213**] levels, and her hematocrit on
the day of discharge was 29.8.
