Admission Date:  [**2157-1-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2157-1-11**]


Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80 year-old female
from [**Hospital3 **] facility with a past medical history
significant for hypertension, congestive heart failure (last
ejection fraction in [**2149**] of 35%), atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin and rate control with beta blocker, history of
multiple transient ischemic attacks and two cerebrovascular
accidents with a recent admission to [**Hospital1 190**] for a gastrointestinal bleed from a colonic
AVM status post cauterization who presents to the Emergency
Department three days after discharge from the hospital on
Coumadin and Lasix with a recurrence of bright red blood per
rectum.  During previous hospitalization from [**12-22**] to
[**12-30**] the patient was treated with multiple units of
packed red blood cells, had episodes of atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular response and underwent endoscopy and
colonoscopy.  During the hospitalization she was diagnosed
with multiple gastric ulcers, sigmoid diverticulosis and a
colonic AVM that was cauterized.  In addition, there was
questionable malt lymphoma seen on pathology from biopsy of
the gastric ulcerations.  During the hospitalization her
Coumadin was discontinued and she was placed on heparin.
However, on discharge given her increased risk for
cerebrovascular accident off of anticoagulation she was
discharged on Coumadin with a Lovenox bridge.  On admission
to the hospital this time the patient was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit.  She does have a positive history of
fatigue and decreased po intake for greater then one months
time without significant weight loss.

2.  Coumadin.
3.  Lovenox.
4.  Pantoprazole.
5.  Atorvastatin.
6.  Moexipril.
7.  Triamterene.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO THE FLOOR FROM THE MICU:
1.  Pantoprazole 40 b.i.d.
2.  Metoprolol 100 b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Temperature 98.6.  Blood
pressure 150/70.  Pulse 76.  Respiratory rate 20.  97% on 2
liters.  Significant for dry mucous membranes.  No JVD.
Irregularly irregular with normal rate.  Abdomen benign.  No
peripheral edema.  All organ systems examined and found to be
within normal limits.

LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER:  Hematocrit 30.1, platelets, INR
1.1, albumin 2.9, magnesium 1.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 80 year-old female with a
past medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation,
recent gastrointestinal bleed with possible malt lymphoma who
presents with recurrent bright red blood per rectum.

1.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient is admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit at which time she received vitamin K, 5
units of fresh frozen platelets and 6 units of packed red
blood cells to keep her hematocrit stable.  Her admission
hematocrit was 34.4.  On transfer to the floor the patient's
hematocrit remained around high 29s to 30s until discharge.
The patient received an upper endoscopy that revealed
nonbleeding gastric ulcers and biopsies were taken, a
negative red blood cell scan and a colonoscopy that revealed
nonbleeding AVM.  The patient continued on Pantoprazole 40 mg
twice a day, which was transitioned to once a day prior to
discharge.  She remained hemodynamically stable after
transfer to the floor.  On admission her Lovenox was
discontinued and her Coumadin was held.  However, prior to
discharge the patient was started on low dose Coumadin given
her increase for cerebrovascular accident and she had no
further bleeding. She has been discharged with a stable
hematocrit.  She will follow up with the gastrointestinal
team in clinic.

2.  Questionable malt lymphoma:  Patient with a recent
history of fatigue, decreased po intake and low albumin.
During previous hospitalization gastric biopsy showed
possible malt lymphoma.  During this hospitalization repeat
gastric biopsies were obtained and the results were pending
at this time. The patient will follow up with
gastroenterology for results.

3.  History of atrial fibrillation:  In previous
hospitalization the patient had rapid atrial fibrillation,
however, during this hospitalization her heart rate was well
controlled.  Initially her beta blocker was held, but
restarted prior to admission to the floor.

4.  Hypertension:  Given the patient's gastrointestinal bleed
her beta blocker and ace inhibitor were held.  Prior to
admission to the floor her beta blocker was reinstated and
her ace inhibitor was reinstated one day later.  Blood
pressure remained well controlled in the 130s to 140 range.
The patient is being discharged without Triamterene.  She
will follow up with primary care physician for further blood
pressure control if needed.

5.  History of cerebrovascular accidents:  During
hospitalization the patient had an episode of acute onset of
numbness and paresthesias in the left lower extremities
associated with transient weakness.  Symptoms appeared to be
consistent with transient ischemic attack.  Neuro stroke team
was consulted.  An MRA showed small recent infarct within the
right middle cerebral artery territory involving the
superolateral right temporal lobe, old infarcts in the left
frontal and parietal lobes, left frontal, parietal,
cerebellar, occipital regions.  MRA showed poor visualization
of the distal right PCA.  Neurology interpreted these
results as possible arterial stenosis.  The patient's
symptoms resolved within resolved within a half an hour and
there was no residual weakness.  She has regained function.
The patient is being discharged to her daughter's home with
services.  Given evidence of the patient's hypercoagulability
off of anticoagulation she was restarted on Coumadin at a
lower dose then she was previously on without bridging
heparin or Lovenox.  She was kept in the hospital for a few
days for observation to make sure that she did not have any
bleeding complications.  She is being discharged to her
daughter's house with frequent INR checks.  The new INR goal
is 1.8 to 2.5 lower then the previous INR goal.  The hope is
that she will be less likely to have a recurrence of a
gastrointestinal bleed from this new level and her colonic
AVM will have time to heal.

6.  FEN:  The patient had to be repleted with magnesium
multiple times, therefore she is being discharged on
magnesium supplementation to be followed as an outpatient.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable without recurrence of
gastrointestinal bleed, hemodynamically stable, hematocrit
stable around 30, tolerating po diet, walking with a steady
gait occasional with a cane and with an INR of 1.2.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Lower gastrointestinal bleed from colonic AVM.
2.  Multiple gastric ulcers.
3.  Probable new cerebrovascular accident versus transient
ischemic attack.
4.  Probable malt lymphoma.
5.  Atrial fibrillation.
6.  Congestive heart failure.
7.  Diverticulosis.
8.  History of thyroid nodule.
9.  Hypertension.
10.  History of non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
11.  Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic
regurgitation.
12.  Left ventricular hypertrophy.
13.  History of falls walks with a cane in the right hand at
baseline.
14.  History of two to three cerebrovascular accidents.
15.  History of transient ischemic attacks.
16.  Coronary artery disease.

FOLLOW UP:  Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] early next week.  His
office will call to set up an appointment.  In addition the
patient has an appointment wi
