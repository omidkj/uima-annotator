mitral regurgitation, hypertension, BOOP and status post
recent left hip fracture repair.  The patient presented with
persistent worsening of shortness of breath.  In the
Emergency Department the patient was noted to be in rapid
atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure.  After a
CTA to rule out PE was done the patient at that time
developed worsening hypoxia and was transiently on BiPAP and
went to the Coronary Care Unit.  After she was appropriately
rate controlled and diuresed the patient was transferred to
the floor for further management of her atrial fibrillation.

psychosis.
6.  Glaucoma.
7.  OSA.

9.  History of angiopathy.
10.  Status post cerebrovascular accident times three.
11.  Left hip fracture.

ALLERGIES:  Prednisone causes psychosis.  Tape and
Bacitracin
