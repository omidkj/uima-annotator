History of Present Illness:
[Per admission H&P]
66-year-old male with history of COPD (Gold moderate in '[**72**],
DLCO 45%) and NSCLC s/p cyberknife [**6-23**], prostate ca s/p
prostatectomy '[**69**], who presented to the ED today c/o 4 days of
bilateral lower extremity redness and swelling as well.

Mr [**Known lastname 3444**] states that he was in his usual state of chronic
illness, but overall good health until tuesday night when he
realized that his right foot was "leaking like someone peeing in
the bed."  The next morning when he awoke he noticed that his
right leg was swollen much more than the left and that there was
liquid weeping from his right heel.  He thought that he should
come to the emergency department but new that his "home-maker"
was coming on friday so he decided to wait until then.  He noted
that he couldn't get a sock on his right foot so he put on a
"hospital bootie" that he kept "pushing down" eventually causing
an ulcer/skin tear.

When his home make came to see him today, and they decided
together to take an ambulance.

In the ED inital vitals were 99.1 118 97/55 20 99%.  In the ED
the patient stated that he felt short of breath because he was
anxious about his legs but denied chest pain. He was given
duonebs.  He denies any change in his sputum which he states is
"always dirty" and thats why he sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He doesn't
feel more short of breath than he did at home.

Exam was notable for bilateral lower extremity pitting edema
right significantly larger than left. Warmth and minimal
erythema were noted along the dorsal aspect of the right foot.
CXR was performed and revealed a bilateral upper lobe pneumonia
and given the patients frequent interactions with the health
care system and underlying bronchiectasis he was started on
vanc/cefepime for HCAP as well as ?cellulitis.

Lower extremity doppler was performed and revealed a
non-occlusive clot involving the right calf, common femoral and
possible the illiac.  Heparin bolus and drip was initiated in
the ED. There was concern for overlying cellulitis.

Blood pressures were noted to be soft 93/51 a fluid bolus was
given and the decision was made to admit to the ICU.


On the floor he is in great spirits and arrives with normal
vitals.

OTHER STUDIES
===============
ECG ([**2173-1-8**]):
Sinus tachycardia. Low voltage in the limb leads. Q waves in
leads V1-V2
suggest possible prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. No
diagnostic
change from tracing of [**2172-5-8**]

Chest Radiograph (PA and Lat) ([**2173-1-8**]):
IMPRESSION: Worsening right upper lobe and new left lung,
predominantly upper lobe opacity, concerning for pneumonia.

Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasounds ([**2173-1-8**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Partially occlusive DVT in the right lower extremity
extending from the
posterior tibial veins up to at least the right common femoral
vein. Proximal extent of the DVT is not seen, but most likely
extends into the right iliac vein(s). Peroneal veins not
completely visualized.
2. No DVT in the left lower extremity.

TTE ([**2173-1-11**]):
onclusions
Poor image quality.The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

RUQ Ultrasound ([**2173-1-14**]):
Normal examination of the liver and gallbladder. Midline
obscured by bowel gas, as described above.

CT A/P ([**2173-1-15**]):
1. No evidence for intra-abdominal abscess or colitis. Diffusely
distended
colon with large amount of stool.
2. Right lower lobe consolidation, concerning for pneumonia.
Follow up CT
after treatment is recommended to evaluate for und
