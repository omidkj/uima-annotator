History of Present Illness:
This is a 45 year-old male with history of HIV/AIDS([**4-12**] CD4 53,
VL < 50), HCC (w/ cirrhosis) who was found to have mental status
changes after taking tincture of opium. The patient says he has
had diarrhea for 2 years, but has been worse over past couple of
days. Usually this is relieved with loperamide, though over last
2 days diarrhea worse and took opium. The morning of the
admission the patient took an unknown amount of opium and mother
noted patient was somnolent and difficult to arouse. The patient
said with the recent diarrhea he had some abdominal pain,
nausea, fever to 101 and some streaks of blood in his stool.
Based on his somnolence he was brought to ED.
.
In the ED, patient received naloxone 0.8mg with intermittent
improvement in mental status followed by relapse to original
state. He also complained of headache at this time. Due to
headache and concern for meningitis, patient received head CT
and also 1 dose of acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. Blood
cultures were sent prior to this. He was also given lactulose
for possible hepatic encephalopathy. Due to concern for naloxone
requirement and periods of apnea, patient was transferred to
MICU for further respiratory monitoring.
.
His micu course was uncomplicated, he had some meds (trazodone,
mirtazapine, percocet and clonazepam) held to prevent further
somnolene and he was given lactulose for high ammonia. Initially
treated for presumed meningitis given fevers, given ceftriaxone,
azithromycin and vancomycin His mental status improved and he
was transferred to medicine.
.
Currently patient feels well, had formed, non-bloody stool
today.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 y.o. male with history of AIDS, HCV cirrhosis, polysubstance
abuse, diarrhea, admitted for mental status changes and
respiratory monitoring.
.
His micu course was uncomplicated, he had some meds (trazodone,
mirtazapine, percocet and clonazepam) held to prevent further
somnolence and he was given lactulose for high ammonia.
Initially treated for presumed meningitis given fevers, he was
given ceftriaxone, azithromycin and vancomycin. His mental
status improved and he was transferred to medicine.
.
Floor course:
.
#) Mental status changes - The patient's mental status changes
were likely related to his overdose of opium, as his mental
status improved through his course.  Given his elevated ammonia
a concern for encephalopathy was raised, but this was unlikely.
Given this concern the patient was initially treated with
lactulose, and rifaximin. With the history of fever and headache
in ED, he was initially treated for meningitis, though on the
floor he was afebrile with no meningismus, so concern for
meningitis was low and he was not treated any further.  On the
floor, his mental status improved and this was again related to
opium overdose.  Given this his lactulose and rifaximin were
stopped.  He was doing well prior to discharge, and as blood
cultures were sent in the ED, and should be followed as an
outpatient.
.
#) Cirrhosis: The patient had improved mental status on the
floor, and while he had elevated ammonia it was unlikley he had
encephalopathy, so his lactulose and rifaximin (given in the ED
and MICU) were stopped. He did not appear to have a large amount
of ascites, though given his delicate fluid balance he had an US
which showed minimal ascites. As he had Acute renal failure, his
lasix and spironolactone were held, and his fluid balance was
closely followed.  His renal function improved prior to
discharge, so to prevent fluid overload his diuretics were
restarted at a lower dose, and he will be followed closely by ID
and the coinfection clinic as an outpatient, so he is maintained
on the appropriate dose of diuretics to prevent reacummulation
of ascites.
.
#) HIV - The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3394**], and he is on
appropriate medications.  He was followed by ID and was
continued on PCP and MAC prophylaxis with [**Last Name (STitle) 7615**] and
azithromycin respectively, and also continued on his
antiretroviral regimen (Emtricitabine, tenofovir, abacavir,
ritonavir, atazanavir).  He will be closely followed by ID and
the coinfection clinic as an outpatient.
.
#) Diarrhea - The patient has chronic diarrhea, and the acute
worsening was likely due to the lactulose he was given.  ID did
not feel this was infectious, though stool cultures were sent
and should be followed as an outpatient.  With the
discontinuation of his lactulose and rifaximin, and with
starting imodium, the patient's diarrhea improved and he was at
