Service: OMED

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3276**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from ECHO lab after finding pericardial effusion.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis with temporary drain

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 67-year-old w/ newly diagnosed metastatic non-small cell
lung cancer, originally called in to ED after finding of
pericardial effusion on ECHO. SHe was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name **]
service on [**2119-9-25**] for pericardial effusion and went to cath for
drainage of 240 cc of serous fluid with relief of tamponade.  A
drain was placed in the pericardial sac, with 9 cc of outpu per
discussion with the CCU resident.  F/u echocardiograms showed no
pericardial effusion.  The drain was removed [**2119-9-29**] and she was
transferred to the OMED for further oncologic mangement.  MICU
course c/b [**Month/Day/Year **] and rising WBC count, now being treated for
PNA.

Further background history prior to admission is as follows.
The pt was in her usual good state of health until mid-[**Month (only) 205**] when
she noted a dry [**Month (only) **], increased fatigue, and decreased
appetite. In early [**Month (only) 216**], she had a chest x-ray, which showed
multiple pulmonary nodules, followed by CT scan of her chest at
[**Location (un) 620**], which confirmed multiple pulmonary nodules, bilateral
pleural effusions, and a possible pericardial effusion.  A
subsequent lymph node biopsy from the right lateral neck on
[**2119-9-14**] and showed poorly differentiated non-small cell
carcinoma consistent with lung primary.

Per the admission note ROS: the patient has continued to [**Date Range **]
sometimes at night, often during the day. The only thing that
she has been taking is an over-the-counter regimen. She may have
tried Tessalon but not clear on the dose. She had a mammogram a
year ago that was fine. She notes no breast problems or past
history of breast issues.  Denies cp/palpitaitions. No pleuritic
CP.  Mild inc in SOB w/ exertion on one flight of stairs.  No
orthopnea/PND.  Denies f/chills/n/v.

Current ROS on transfer to OMED:

Echo [**9-25**]:
Impression: Large pericardial effusion with right atrial
collapse detected. The right ventricle appears compressed, but
no clear diastolic collapse is seen. Cannot fully exclude
tamponade physiology. Clinical correlation is required.

Echo [**9-26**], [**9-28**]:
 Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right
 ventricular systolic function is normal. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. No
 mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial pericardial
effusion. There
 is echo dense material within the pericardial space consistent
with blood,
 inflammation or other cellular elements.

 Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of [**2119-9-26**],
 there has been no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
67F newly-diagnosed NSCLCa presented originally for
echocardiogram to evaluate shortness of breath, found to have
significant tamponade.

1) Pericardial effusion:  Catheterization revealed a significant
pericardial effusion with tamponade.  Pericardiocentesis was
successfully performed in the catheterization lab and a drain
was placed.  The patient did well and was taken to the CCU for
continued monitoring.  Following the procedure the drain
continued to put out 9cc over 18 hours.  Repeat echocardiogram
two days following pericardiocentesis revealed no reaccumulation
of fluid.  The drain was removed on the second day following
percardiocentesis and the patient was transferred from the CCU
to the OMED service.  Patient continued to do well following
removal of the drain with pulsus paradoxicus ranging between
5-7mmHg.

On therapeutic cath, found to have sig tamponade -> s/p
pericardiocentesis with post-procedure drain.  Patient monitored
in CCU given post-procedure drain with limited (9 cc) output in
18 hrs.  Pt transferred to OMED for further oncologic mangement.
 MICU course c/b [**Date Range **] and rising WBC count, treated for PNA,
completed course of antibiotics.

2) Shortness of breath: Despite successful pericardiocentesis,
patient continued to have shortness of breath and supplement
oxygen requirement.  Chest xray revealed a number of
nodularities likely due to the patient's NSCLC disease, however,
a pneumonia could not be excluded.  Therefore, the patient was
started on antibiotic therapy for a presumed pneumonia.  She
completed a 11 day course of antibiotics.

On CXR she was noted to have an enlarging left sided pleural
effusion.  On [**2119-10-3**] she had an ultrasound guided
thoracentesis, at which time 1200mls of fluid were removed.  Her
SOB improved after the thoracentesis.  Over the next several
days she continued to have gradually increasing SOB.  A repeat
CXR on [**2119-10-9**] showed re-accumulation of her left sided pleural
effusion and worsening of her right sided pleural effusion.  She
had a repeat ultrasound guided thoracentesis on [**2119-10-10**] at which
time 1050ml of fluid was removed prior to the proceedure being
terminated for [**Date Range **].

3) NSCLCa: She was started on Chemotherapy while in house for
her NSCLCA.  Her first course of Taxol/Carboplatinum was on
[**2119-9-29**], she tolerated the treatment well.  She had neutropenia
requiring her to be placed on precautions and treated with GCSF.
 Her WBC count resolved with GCSF treatment.  She had a dosage
of Taxol chemotherapy on [**2119-10-9**].  Social work has been envolved
with her discussing coping and her diagnosis.  On discharge she
was started on Megace to encourage increased PO intake.

4) [**Date Range **]: While in the hospital she had lots of problems with
[**Name2 (NI) **] productive of white sputum.  She was treated with tesillon
perles, robitussin w/ codeine, hydrocodone syrup, and cepacol
losenges.

5) Depression/Anxiety: While in the hospital she was continued
on her outpatient regimen of Buspar, Paxil CR, and Ativan/Xanax
as needed.

6) Oral thrush: While in the hospital she was found to have some
oral thrush and was started on Nystatin swish and swallow.

7) Hypotension/decreased Urine output/dehydration: After coming
out of the CCU she was found to be hypotensive.  She responded
well to fluids.  Several days later she was orthostatic while
ambulating with PT.  She responded again to IV fluids.  I
