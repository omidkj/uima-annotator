This is a discharge summary addendum summarizing events from
[**2153-1-1**] to [**2153-1-2**].

ADDENDUM:  Over the course of [**2153-1-1**], the patient's
clinical status continued to deteriorate.  As mentioned in
previous discharge summary, patient had a long and
complicated hospital course which began in [**6-/2152**] with AV
endocarditis.  This was complicated by catastrophic CVA,
septic joint infection, destruction of the aortic valve, and
multiple infections and complications.  Most recently,
patient had VRE bacteremia, subclavian venous thrombosis, and
decompensated heart failure, which lead to acute renal
failure, volume overload, acidosis, and finally respiratory
arrest on [**2153-1-2**].  From an ID standpoint, patient was
continued on linezolid and his [**2152-12-27**] cultures had no
growth to date, but it was still unclear if patient would be
able to proceed with valve surgery which would ultimately be
the therapy of choice, but with patient's poor clinical
status as well as his ongoing bacteremia, it was unclear if
patient could have surgery.  He remained in very
decompensated CHF and failed many regimens including Lasix,
Natrecor, fluid challenge, etc.  It was unclear what the next
course of action should be, given the fact of his rising
creatinine and his lack of renal perfusion.  The only options
that remained include tailored therapy with an ionotrope, but
it was unclear what the endpoint would be with this type of
therapy or whether patient should have CVVH.  His status
continued to decline and he became barely responsive on the
day of his death.  He remained a full code until the day of
his death and his brother was his healthcare proxy in the
discussion that were made many times during his hospital
course about the patient's poor prognosis and the futility of
further interventions.  On the day of his death, [**2153-1-2**],
his management was discussed with all of the consultants
involved, and it was determined there were no viable medical
or surgical options left for him.  His brother and sister
were made aware and on [**2153-1-2**] at 4:30 p.m., the medicine
internist was called.  The patient was unresponsive with O2
saturation of 50 percent.  A code was called and the ICU and
CCU teams responded immediately.  Patient still had a pulse,
normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute.  His ABG was 7.13
with a PAO2 of 64 and a PCO2 of 51.  Patient was bagged and
then intubated, a repeat gas of 7.27, PCO2 of 30, and PAO2 of
124.  The family was immediately notified and were present.
After intubation, the patient's family decided on extubation
at 5:00 p.m. to make the patient comfort measures only with a
morphine drip.  At 6:10 p.m., the patient expired.  Breath
sounds were absent, and the patient was without pulse.  He
had no heart sounds.  Pupils were nonreactive.  Corneal
reflex was absent.  He had no response to pain.  [**Name (NI) **]
sister was present at his bedside.  The attending, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and admitting was notified.  The patient's family
declined a postmortem exam.
