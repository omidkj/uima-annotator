Morphine / adhesive tape / Protonix

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1384**]
Chief Complaint:
perforated bowel

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- [**1-7**]: Ex-lap, Right colectomy and ileostomy
- [**1-11**]: Abdominal washout, placement of [**Doctor Last Name **] drain, abdominal
closure


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 51 year old female with history of etoh/HCV
cirrhosis who was transfer to BIMDC ED from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
with free air on the CT scan, hemodynamically unstable on
pressors. Patient was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2133-1-3**]
w/acute abdominal pain, dry heaves and on a CT scan findings of
transmural thickening of the right sided colon consistent with
colitis and a finding of constipation. Of note at the time of
the presentation to the ED at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital her bp was
72/44. [**Name8 (MD) **] CRT was 1.7 from baseline of 0.9; she presented in
acute renal failure. (She is diuretic dependent at baseline.)
After she was admitted, she was treated w/IV cipro, colace,
senna and lactulose
30 [**Hospital1 **]. Patient developed upper GI bleed on HD 3 ([**1-5**] in the
morning). She has EGD which showed bleeding from the duodenal
ulcer at the bulb. The endoclip was placed. The biopsy was taken
from the stomach mucosa. Patient seemed to be stable for
approximately 24 hours post-EGD. On HD 4 ([**1-6**] in the evening),
she was found to be obtunded, was intubated, started on propofol
and later versed. After the propofol strated the patient became
hypotensive and was resuscitated with fluids. She had a CT scan
of the abdomen which showed layering of free air within the
abdomen. Patient recieved unasyn 3 gm and flagyl as a response.
She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, as ED accepted the
transfer. Upon arrival patient was levophed and has recieved a
total of 6 liters of fluid since the time she was intubated. She
is currently on cpap.
