Imaging:
========
CXR [**4-4**]: Diffuse opacities involving the left lung is compatible
with pneumonia.
.
CT chest [**4-6**]: Extensive left upper and lateral segment of left
lower lobe consolidation with surrounding septal thickening and
ground-glass. Given the clinical features of fever and acute
hypoxia, this most likely represents an extensive bacterial
pneumonia.
.
CXR [**4-9**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is mild
improvement of the left-sided pneumonia. The opacities
pre-existing in the left lung has mildly decreased in extent.
Unchanged normal appearance of the right lung. Unchanged
appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo M with limited past medical history, who ultimately
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on afternoon of [**4-4**] after 4 days of
malaise and chills.  Found to have legionella pneumonia.
.
#. Legionella pneumonia: patient was admitted with fevers and
hypoxia and found to have positive Legionella assay. He was
treated on the floor with azithromycin and levofloxacin but
continued to develop worsening oxygen requirment necessitating
transfer to the MICU. In the MICU, he was maintained on facemask
with high flow oxygen and transitioned to nasal cannula but
continued to have mild respiratory distress. He did not require
intubation. CT chest and CXR confirmed involvement of both the
left upper and left lower lobe. He was provided with chest PT.
After some clinical improvement, azithromycin was discontinued
and he was continued on levofloxacin monotherapy for a total of
14 day course (at time of transfer was on day [**5-15**]). He was
transferred to an LTAC to continue his antibiotic course, to
wean down oxygen, and to continue pulmonary therapy. He should
follow up with his geriatric NP[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 715**] after discharge from
rehab.
.
#. Left pleural effusion: patient had a thoracentesis with IP on
[**2136-4-6**]. Given elevated pleural fluid LDH to 461, is most
consistent with a parapneumonic effusion. CXR post-thoracentesis
on the floor was without concern for pneumothorax. Pleural fluid
gram stain was negative and culture showed no growth on [**4-9**].
Pleural fluid pH was 7.44 and no indication for chest tube
placement.
.
#. Crohn's disease: Reportedly asymptomatic at this time.
Continue homed pentasa 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
#. Anemia: HCT stable at 37.2, up from 35.5 at admission.
Baseline anemia likely from chronic GI losses from Crohn's
disease, though not microcytic. Will need further outpatient
work-up.
