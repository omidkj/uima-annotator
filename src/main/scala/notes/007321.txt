Studies:
[**2135-4-26**] CXR: IMPRESSION: New left mid-and-lower lung
consolidation compatible with
pneumonia in the proper clinical setting. Subtle opacity at the
right lung
base could represent atelectasis or developing infiltrate as
well. Recommend
repeat after treatment to document resolution.
.
[**4-29**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Multifocal encephalomalacia in the coronae radiatae, left
occipital pole
and left cerebellar hemisphere, related to prior territorial
infarcts.
.
[**2135-5-3**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Malpositioned percutaneous gastrostomy tube, has retracted
with tip and
the balloon now terminating in the transverse colon. Contrast
administered
via the G-tube fills the colon. Possible residual fistulous
communication of the colon with the stomach.
2. No evidence of associated complication such as gross colonic
perforation; in particular, no free air or fluid in the abdomen.

3. Bilateral moderate-sized simple pleural effusions. Patchy
consolidation
in the right middle lobe may represent changes of aspiration, or
less likely early infection.
4. Fatty liver, cholelithiasis, and left adrenal hyperplasia.
5. Mild colonic wall thickening predominantly in the transverse
and
descending colon may be secondary to underdistension or less
likely due to
early mild colitis. No evidence of pseudomembranous colitis.
.
ECHO [**5-9**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). The right atrium is moderately dilated. There
is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and
inferolateral wall and mild global hypokinesis of the remaining
segments (LVEF = 35-40 %). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Prominent symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with regional and global hypokinesis as
described above. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-3-18**], the
severity of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation
have increased, left ventricular systolic function is more
depressed and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is higher.
.
[**2135-5-9**] HEAD CT:IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hemorrhage, edema or new infarction.
2. Chronic infarcts in bilateral MCA and left PCA distributions.
