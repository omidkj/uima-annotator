Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
64 M h/o obesity, PVD, CKD (baseline unknown), DVT ~6-10y ago,
recently d/c'd [**11-9**] from [**Hospital3 417**] after presenting s/p
fall x 2 (described SSCP 15m prior, non-radiating, in AM, then
LH/dizzy after leaving the shower, fell x 2 10 min apart, no
LOC, preceding SOB, PALP, N/V), with negative p-mibi and TTE
with normal valves, EF.
.
Pt in his USOH at home until ~7PM [**11-14**], went outside, slid on
ice, fell, landing on both knees, then falling towards right,
bruised R elbow.  no LOC, no head trauma.  No antecedent
CP/SOB/PALP/LH/N/V/diaphoresis.  Neighbors brought him inside,
~1hr later, pt started c/o mid-back and central chest pain with
some radiation to both shoulders, dull, no sob/n/v/diaphoresis,
starting ~7PM, at 930pm pain persisted, pt called EMS. no pain
with inspiration, no pain with exertion (though pt not moving
much). states pain worse with bending over.
.
EMS initial VS= BP 126/80 99%RA, EKG per report, sinus
arrythmia, nonspecific ST changes, poor r-wave progression.
given nitro with resolution of CP prior to arrival at OSH ~1030
(unclear if before or after nitro).  At OSH, CK 421 MB TROP
7.16, INR 2.3, heparin gtt ordered however not given [**12-23**]
pharmacy refused due to INR.  Per report, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] decided
against heparin gtt today, instead pt given plavix 300mg 6am on
[**11-15**], and again at 10:30.  no other meds given o/n.
.
On morning of transfer [**11-15**], 7AM VS= NSR, 97.7, 75-68, RR 20,
BP 108/54 (108/54-124/84), 96%RA->100%2L, pt given asa 325,
lopressor 25mg po x 1, mucomyst 600mg x 1, percocet for
bilateral feet pain, IVF= 2ampHCO3 + 1/2 NS @ 11:15AM 100/hr.
[**Name8 (MD) **] RN pt denied CP, though reported intermittent pain to
cardiologist.  Pt being transferred to CCU for further workup of
chest discomfort, described as radiating from the back towards
chest.
.
With regard to cardiac review of systems, pt denies any h/o
regular angina or chest pain with exertion.  He has stable DOE
with occasionally with dressing himself more often with a flight
of stairs.  His bilateral ankle edema is chronic and unchanged
of late, with chronic venous stasis changes.  He denies
PND/orthopnea, but notes an episode of syncope prior to his most
recent hospilazation, though it is unclear if he truly lost
consciousness.  He denies any preceding
cp/sob/palpitation/n/v/diaphoresis, and states he slipped
getting out of the tub.  Of note, ~15min later, he admits to
falling again in his bedroom.  At that time he endorses lh/dizzy
prior to fall, but cannot recall if he lost consciousness.
.
ROS: +cough, non-productive, +DOE, claudication - after walking
20-30 feet, bilateral calf pain, improves within 10-15min, no
rest pain, but + "numbness" bilateral feet with "pins and
needles" which improves with walking.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

STUDIES:
[**2124-11-15**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the inferior, septal
and anterior walls, and apex. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 30 %). No defininte left ventricular thrombus
is seen, but views of the apex are suboptimal. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD (mid-LAD and
PDA lesions).
