Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Aphasia, CODE STROKE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV TPA


History of Present Illness:
73 yo RHF with history of possible prior stroke (details
unclear), NIDDM, diastolic dysfunction, s/p left total knee
replacement [**6-20**] at NEBH.   After the procedure in the PACU she
was noted to develop sudden aphasia, right-sided arm and leg
weakness and left tongue deviation.  She was last seen normal at
8:30pm and symptoms were noted at 8:45 PM.  Her comprehension
remained intact as per the medical record and she denied any
headache, visual changes, or neck pain.  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] and a code stroke was activated at 9:42 PM.  On initial
neurologic examination by the ED physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient was
noted to have right face/arm/leg weakness, gaze preference to
the left, left tongue deviation, and severe aphasia; that
physician gave her [**Name9 (PRE) 18246**] score of 10.  On initial neurologic
examination by the neurology stroke fellow, which took place 20
minutes after the examination by the ED physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient
had an isolated expressive aphasia, a questionable mild right
facial droop, and a mild dysarthria.  Her comprehension was
entirely intact, and - through a series of yes/no questions and
answers, we were able to ascertain that the patient had no
nausea, headache, dizziness, palpitations, or pain.

appears to be effort-dependent and LLE was not testable due to

not testable)

extremities.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 11925**] is a 73-year-old right-handed female with ? history
of stroke in [**2178**], NIDDM, diastolic dysunction, s/p L total knee
replacement [**6-20**] at NEBH with sudden development of aphasia and
right-sided weakness while in [**Hospital 53180**] transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] as code stroke with NIHSS 6, and was administered IV TPA
given her the severity of her speech deficit.  Neurological
examination on admission showed a mild right facial droop, mild
dysarthria, and nonfluent speech.  Her motor exam appears more
consistent with giveway weakness and her deficits do not appear
unilateral. MRI head the following AM showed no evidence of
acute infarct.  Given the lack of infarct by MRI and full
resolution of her deficits in the setting of tPA, the episode is
being diagnosed as a transient ischemic attack.

Neurology ICU course:
The patient was monitored in the intensive care unit s/p IV TPA
and had an uneventful course to date.  Her home antihypertensive
medications were held and she was given normal saline boluses to
maintain systolic blood pressure above 110 mmHg.  A lipid panel
revealed LDL of 79 and she was continued on her home
simvastatin. A TTE showed no evidence of a cardiac source
(however it was noted to be a suboptimal evaluation for PFO),
and there have not been any arrhythmias on telemetry.
Antiplatelet agents were intially held, resumed [**6-22**]. transfer to
floor [**6-22**].

Neurology Floor Course:
Pt had a normal neurologic examination with occasional slow
speech, but no deficits of language. She was continued on daily
aspirin therapy. She had a syncopal episode after standing from
the commode on the day of discharge. Her neurologic examination
was normal. She was notably orthostatic. Oral rehydration was
encouraged. Her diuretic dose was halved. She should follow up
in clinic with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital1 18**].

ID:
She had a mild leukocytosis with no clear source but has been
afebrile and the WBC is trending down.  CXR, UA, culture, blood
cultures were all within normal limits.

Cardiovascular:
Budesonide was initially held, then restarted at 100mg daily.
Given poor PO intake it was decreased to 50mg daily. Clinical
signs for volume overload and titration of diuretics may occur
at rehab. Zestril was restarted, diovan was held and may be
restarted pending serial blood pressure monitoring and
resulution of her orth
