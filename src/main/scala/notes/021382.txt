Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia, PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 46**] is a 78yo female with PMH significant for chronic
ventilator dependence, CAD, and atrial fibrillation who is being
transferred from rehab for hypoxia and PEA arrest. History
obtained from chart and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at rehab facility. Patient was
reported to be restless this morning but was awake and alert
this morning. At approximately 9:30am a code blue was called
when the vent alarms went off and the patient was found to be
cyanotic and pulseless with the trach disconnected from the vent
tubing. MD arrived at this time. Chest compressions were
performed for 15 seconds and ambubag started with prompt return
of pulses and improvement in O2 saturation. Her color also came
back quickly. Blood sugar was 165. EKG post arrest had no
evidence of ischemic changes. Patient remained unresponsive,
gasping on vent, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
work-up. Of note, she was recently discharged from on [**2-24**] from
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after coming in with similar presentation and was
admitted overnight for closer monitoring. She was discharged on
2 week course of Vanco/Zosyn for treatment of VAP.
In the ED initial vitals were T 100.6 BP 238/88 AR 117 RR 40 O2
sat 96% on ventilator. On arrival she was noted to have some ?
of posturing and shaking of her chin. She received Vancomycin
1gm IV, Zosyn 4.5gm IV, Levaquin 500mg IV, and Ativan 2mg IV. CT
head and cxray were unrevealing.

Past Medical History:
1)Ventillator dependence since [**1-5**] s/p trach (perhaps due to
GBS), successfully decanulated in [**10-7**], however readmitted
[**Date range (1) 76415**] for evaluation of small tracheal mass and
desaturated in the setting of bronchoscopy and trach was
replaced. AC 0.6/500/12/5
2)Hypertension
3)CHF
4)DMII c/b neuropathy
5)Anemia
6)CAD
7)Syncope
8)hyperlipidemia
9)COPD
10)Atrial fibrillation

Social History:
Lives in [**Location 86**] area. Former smoker, quit 20 years ago. No
current alcohol or IVDA.

Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
vitals T 99.5 BP 149/66 AR 78 RR 32 O2 sat 100%
vent settings: PCV FiO2 1.00 RR 28 31/8
Gen: Patient sedated, responsive to sternal rub
HEENT: Pupils sluggish, PERRLA (R>L)
Heart: RRR, no m,r,g
Lungs: CTAB
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, +BS; PEG tube in place
Extremities: No LE edema, 2+ DP/PT pulses bilaterally
Neuro: Sedated, spontaneous movement of upper and lower
extremities

Pertinent Results:
Relevant Imaging:
1)Cxray ([**3-25**]): A tracheostomy tube is in position.  There is
cardiomegaly and aortic knob rim calcification.  The appearance
of the lungs appears grossly stable to that from [**2103-2-24**], with central pulmonary vascular prominence.  There is no
right effusion and the left extreme costophrenic angle is not
included in this radiograph.

2)CT head ([**3-25**]): No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 46**] is a 78yo with chronic ventilator dependence who
presents s/p respiratory and PEA arrest and mental status
changes.

1)Hypoxia/respiratory arrest: Most likely due to tracheostomy
tube being detached from the ventillator. Most likely accidental
per report from rehab facility. She presented very similarly to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] a few weeks ago. She had been treated with 2 week course of
Vanc/Zosyn for possible VAP. She was initially cyanotic but came
back quickly after she was bagged. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was
difficult to bag with poor ABG. As a result, she was initially
placed on PSV settings. The following morning she was changed to
AC and she maintained excellent oxygen saturations. She was
continued on albuterol/atrovent MDI but antibiotics were not
started despite the leukocytosis given her normal blood pressure
and she was also afebrile.

2)PEA arrest: Patient had brief episode of pulselessness at the
rehab in the setting of being hypoxic. She did have chest
compressions but no medications or shocks were administered.
Pulse returned quickly and there were no post-ischemic changes.

3)Mental status changes: Patient found to have new mental status
changes after respiratory and PEA arrest. Per report from rehab,
she was awake and alert this morning. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**],
there was evidence of ? posturing and stiffness in the upper
extremities. Also noted to have chin shaking which was
concerning for underlying seizure activity. CT head was
unrevealing. Initially concerned about anoxic brain since it was
not known how long patient was hypoxic. Early evening of [**3-26**]
patient became more awake and alert and had returned to her
baseline mental status. Neurology following patient closely. MRI
was deferred given improvement in mental status. She did undergo
an EEG which was consistent with encephalopathy.

4)Leukocytosis: Patient has elevated WBC to 19 on admission; 12
at time of last discharge. She is on Prednisone as outpatient.
U/A suggestive of UTI. Also concerned about pulmonary source
since she is chronically vented. [**Month (only) 116**] also be secondary to arrest
and possible anoxic injury.
- Trend daily WBC
- Hold off on antibiotics for now
- f/u blood and urine cultures
- CIS

5)Chronic respiratory failure s/p trach: Thought to be [**3-3**] to
GBS, also with element of tracheomalacia. She was continued on
outpatient regimen of Prednisone and albuterol/atrovent MDI.

6)Anxiety/depression: Patient has history of night time anxiety.
Per medical records she has responded well to Seroquel in the
past although this is not on her current medication list. Also
concerned that she may have de-attached herself intentionally
from the vent due to severe depression. Psych regimen was held
given mental status changes.
- Psych consult
- Obtain outpatient medication list

7)Tremor: Patient supposedly on Primodone as outpatient. Not
seen on list from rehab.

8)Hypertension: Patient on ace-inhibitor and beta-blocker as
outpatient. Initially hypertensive in the ED to 238/88 but BP
normalized to baseline. She was continued on outpatient regimen
with good control of her blood pressures.

9)Type 2 DM: Patient on Lantus and sliding scale as outpatient.
Outpatient regimen was continued with close monitoring of her
blood sugars.

10)FEN: Patient was continued on tube feeds via PEG tube

11)Prophylaxis: Heparin SQ, bowel regimen

12)Code Status: DNR (confirmed with daughter [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76416**]

Facility:
[**Hospital3 672**] Hospital

Discharge Diagnosis:
Pulseless electrical activity secondary to hypoxia


Discharge Condition:
Stable, sitting up in bed talking, respiratory status is stable
on vent


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
your ventilator being disconnected.  You are being discharged on
your baseline ventilatory settings.  You were monitored in the
ICU and found to be stable.

Key medication changes were made.

1. We did not treat you with antibiotics because we did not feel
that you had a pneumonia.  We did continue you on the bactrim
ppx given your chronic steroid use.

2. We have increased your lisinopril from 10mg to 20mg because
you were hypertensive. Your lopressor has been increased from 20
twice a day to 20mg three times a day.

3. Psychiatry did come by and see you.  They recommended the
following:
