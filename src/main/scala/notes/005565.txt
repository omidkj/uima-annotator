Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Mechanical fall


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of atrial
fibrillation (anticoagulated on Coumadin), diastolic heart
failure, s/p [**First Name3 (LF) **] [**First Name3 (LF) **] and failed pancreas [**First Name3 (LF) **],
hypertesnion who is presenting following a mechanical fall at
home and found to be dyspneic in the Emergency Department. He
reports that he tripped over a backpack at home and struck his
head on the front of the sofa. he denies any dizziness or loss
of consciousness before or after the fall. He did not have any
confusion after the fall nor did he lose his urinary continence.
Mr. [**Known lastname 77002**] is experiencing pain in his right rib cage along the
mid-axillary line and in his neck and upper shoulder muscles. He
reports improvement in his pain after receiving morphine. The
patient also reports that his dyspnea on exertion has been
somehat worse for the last several months. He can walk a
straight line for about [**Age over 90 **] yards before becoming short of
breath; he can sometimes handle two flights of stairs. When he
feels like he has "fluid on board," his performance decreases.
He has had occasional lower leg swelling. He denies any recent
changes in his medications.
.
In the ED, the initial vital signs were T 97.8, HR 65, BP
121/69, RR 16 84% on RA. He received both CT head and neck, both
of which were negative. The patient also received chest X-ray
and dedicated rib films have enlarged heart, moderate pulmonary
edema slightly worsened, right pleural effusion resolved, no
left sided pleural effusion, remote fracture in rib 6, no acute
fracture. Bedside FAST negative. The patient received Zofran,
morphine, and 40mg IV Lasix in the Emergency Department. Vitals
on transfer were 97.2, 133/79, 70, 18, 94% 4LNC.
.
On the floor, the patient is comfortable at rest in bed, though
he has some pain with deep breaths and with movement. He is
somewhat sleepy but fully oriented and capable of providing his
history

Studies
CT head [**12-24**]
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect or shift of normally midline structures. There is no
cerebral edema or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation to
suggest an acute ischemic event. Sulci and ventricles are
prominent, likely age related involutional changes. Mild
confluent periventricular hypodensities, likely represent
sequela of small vessel ischemic disease. A focal hypodensity of
in the right putamen (2:17), may represent a remote lacunar
infarct or a prominent virchow-[**Doctor First Name **] space.  Extensive
intracranial and extracranial vascular calcifications are noted.
 Rounded density within the right maxillary sinus, likely
represents a retention cyst. The remainder of paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells appear well aerated.
.
CT C-spine [**12-24**]
There is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel
degenerative disc disease involving the cervical spine is most
pronounced at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with endplate sclerosis and
intervertebral disc space
narrowing. There is posterior disc osteophyte complex formation
at the
corresponding levels with mild impingement on the thecal sac.
There is no
critical central canal stenosis.  Imaged lung apices demonstrate
thickening of interlobular septae compatible with intersitial
edema. Thyroid displays homogeneous attenuation. Extensive
vascular calcifications are noted. Round density projecting over
right maxillary sinus is partially imaged and likely represents
a retention cyst. 1. No evidence of acute fracture or
malalignment. Multilevel degenerative
disc disease of the cervical spine, as described above. In the
setting of
high clinical suspicion for ligamentous or cord injury, may
consider MR for further assessment. 2. Instersitial edema in
imaged lung apices.
.
AP SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST, THREE VIEWS OF RIGHT-SIDED RIBS:
Heart remains moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are stable. There is moderate interstitial pulmonary
edema, which appears slightly worse in the interval. Previously
noted right pleural effusion and right basilar opacification has
essentially resolved. There is no pneumothorax or left-sided
pleural effusion visualized. A BB marker indicating the site of
patient's tenderness is located adjacent to the sixth right
lateral rib.  Irregularity of this rib is compatible with a
remote fracture, as seen on the prior chest CT from [**2163-10-10**]. No acute fractures are visualized.  Multiple clips are
demonstrated within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
IMPRESSION: No acutely displaced rib fractures visualized, with
remote right latera
