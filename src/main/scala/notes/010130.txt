SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  He underwent cardiac
catheterization on admission which revealed a severe aortic
stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.7 cm2, and moderate
mitral regurgitation, a 60 percent ostial left main coronary
artery stenosis.  The LAD had mild luminal irregularities.
The left circumflex had mild diffuse disease.  The right
coronary artery had a 15 percent ostial stenosis.  His
ejection fraction was 25 percent.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted, and the patient also had a carotid
Duplex studies which showed no significant stenosis
bilaterally.  He had a dental consultation who cleared him
for surgery.

On [**9-1**], the patient underwent an AVR with a 23-mm
pericardial tissue valve and a coronary artery bypass
grafting times one with a saphenous vein graft to the LAD.
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery
Unit on Levophed, epinephrine, milrinone, amiodarone, and
propofol.  He was extubated.  Shortly after extubation, he
was in respiratory distress, and stridor, and tachypnea and
was emergently re-intubated.

On postoperative day one, he remained on amiodarone and
milrinone.  He was then extubated again over a bronchoscope
on postoperative day one and did well.  He remained on
milrinone and Neo-Synephrine on postoperative day two.  He
had his chest tubes discontinued on postoperative day two.
He remains on milrinone with a slow wean, and he had atrial
