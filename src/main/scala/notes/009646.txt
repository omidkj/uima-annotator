History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 66 y/o woman w/ a PMH of CMML, HTN, DM, AS (s/p
bio-prosthetic AVR), and CVA who was admitted for bilateral
total knee replacements.  One day post-op she was found to be
tachycardic, hypoxic, and hypotensive.  She had awoken that
morning feeling well and worked with PT but was subsequently
found by the nurse to have a spo2 in the 70's, tachycardic to
the 130's, and hypotensive to the 70's.  She was coded w/ little
BP response to NS/PRBC infusion.  She was bagged with 100% fio2
and an ABG at the time was 7.35/26/256.  She was transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where her respiratory and mental status declined and
she was intubated.  She was found to be in PEA on transfer to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and received atropine and epi w/ return of a perfusing
rhythm.  She was started on pressors at this time.
   In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was noted to have a 20pt HCT drop w/out
obvious source of bleeding other than weakly guaiac positive
stools.  She responded to PRBC infusions and has been stable
afterwards.  ECHO after transfer to the unit showed new wall
motion abnormalities whereas a cath in [**2188**] had been normal.
She developed severe CHF and required lasix gtt but had been
auto-diuresing prior to call-out and her respiratory status has
improved significantly w/ diuresis.  Her pressors were slowly
weaned and she was eventually started on an ace-i and bb
secondary to her new dx of CHF and low EF.  She was originally
started on vanco/zosyn when she developed hypotension [**2-18**]
concerns of sepsis but these were d/c'ed after her BP improved
and all her cultures remained negative.

TTE [**2189-11-20**]
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The  left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic  function is
moderately-to-severely depressed (ejectoion fraction 30 percent)
 secondeary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum,
anterior free wall,  and apex. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. There is no  ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right  ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal  leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is severe
mitral annular calcification. There is moderate thickening of
the mitral valve  chordae. There is a minimally increased
gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be  determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2189-11-17**], the heart rate and left ventricular ejection
fraction are reduced.

CT C/A/P [**2189-11-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Stable pelvic lymphadenopathy.
3. Stable soft tissue mass in the left pelvis, which may
represent a duplication cyst, enlarged lymph node, or left
ovary/mass as stated on the previous examinations.
4. Enlarged right axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes of
uncertain clinical significance.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions.

Ultrasound R upper extremity [**2189-11-26**]
IMPRESSION: No DVT. Thrombus within the distal right cephalic
vein.

DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL  [**2189-11-20**] 3:54 PM
LIVER ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLER: The patient is status post
cholecystectomy. There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
The common bile duct measures 6 mm, which is normal for a
post-cholecystectomy state. The portal vein is patent with
normal direction of flow. The hepatic veins and main hepatic
artery are patent. No ascites is seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation.
2. The hepatic vessels are patent.
3. No evidence of ascites.

KNEE 2 VIEW PORTABLE BILAT  [**2189-11-16**] 1:33 PM

BOTH KNEES: Two nonstandard views show bilateral new total knee
prostheses. Skin staples and drains are in place. There is post
surgical air within the soft tissues.

IMPRESSION: Status post bilateral total knee arthroplasty.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 66 y/o f with CMML, AVR, DM2, HTN admitted for bilateral
total knee replacements who developed shock and hypoxemic
respiratory failure on post-op day 1
.
#Shock -- On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], had a 20 point Hct drop. Was
evaluated extensively and pan scanned but no etiology of
bleeding found. Required 7 units PRBC to increase her Hct. A
STAT echo on transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] showed a possible new wall
motion abnormality (after being coded) but no effusion, no
evidence of tamponade, no changes in AVR, and an EF of 35-40%
Repeat echo [**11-25**] showed persistant EF of 35%.  Cardiology was
consulted and they felt that her decreased LV systolic
dysfunction was post-arrest given her clean coronaries in [**2188**]
in cath for pre-op for her AVR.  They recommended a follow-up
echo at some point in the next few months.
.
1. Hct drop -- No clear source. Ortho evaluated and didn't feel
it's her knees. She is not hemolyzing by labs. An NG lavage was
negative though she was trace guaiac positive (though no
melena/hematochezia). Imaging did not reveal the source of the
bleed and she remained stable for the remainder of her stay.
.
2. Respiratory failure- Unclear what the etiology of the pt's
respiratory failure was on admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Was able to be
weaned down and was extubated on [**11-20**]. However, later that
night, she developed increased work of breathing and was unable
to clear her secretions so pt was reintubated.  Extubated [**11-30**]
after a prolonged wean and difficulty getting off the vent. She
was thought to have difficult extubation due to volume overload
and improved once she was diuresed with a lasix gtt.  Pt was
transfered to the floor on 4L NC.  The patient autodiuresed well
on the floor and was eventually weaned off her O2 requirement.
.
3. New LBBB and [**Name (NI) 48688**] Pt had clean coronaries on cath 4/[**2188**].
New wall motion abnormalities following cardiac arrest on
transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Had chest pain [**11-24**] with unchanged ECG.
Pain worse with palpation, c/w musculoskeletal injury.  She was
started on both a bblocker and acei
