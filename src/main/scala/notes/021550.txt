Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
meningitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture

History of Present Illness:
84y/o F with history of DM, HTN, TIAs ([**5-22**]) initially
transferred from OSH [**7-9**] after presenting to OSH on [**7-4**] with
sudden onset of L hand numbness x1 minute, which resolved
spontaneously. Pt was also noted to have elevated BP to 200s.
Recent head CT was negative; pt was given SC insulin and IV
labetalol in ED. Pt denied fevers/chills, N/V, diarrhea, cough,
bleeding, dysuria, or appetite or weight change.
.
At OSH, pt was initially thought to have hypertensive
encephalopathy; MRI/MRA of brain were unremarkable. Pt's BP came
under better control the following day, but she also became
obtunded. Neurology performed LP. CSF had 425 WBC with 97% PMNs,
3% lymphs. Pt developed leukocytosis subsequently, was culture
negative. Pt was placed on acyclovir, ceftriaxone 1g IV q12, and
vancomycin. Also developed acute renal failure with decreased
urine output; Cr climbed from 1.4 on admission to 4.0 on
discharge. At OSH, pt was seen by renal consultant, who felt
that pt likely had ATN. Pt was also hyperglycemic into 400s with
+ ketonuria and was placed on insulin gtt with D5.  One day
prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], pt became tachypneic. Pt was
intubated, and ABG was 7.29/29/180. On day of transfer, pt
became hypotensive with BP 70/palp. She was started on dopamine
with BP increasing to 104/64.  Pt was then transferred intubated
and on pressors to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further care.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Meningoencephalitis: On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was
obtunded with a high WBC count and neutrophilic pleocytosis in
the CSF at the outside hospital, suggesting likely bacterial
meningitis/encephalitis, with possible etiologies including S.
pneumonia, Listeria, or N. meningitidis.  Given the negative
head CT and MRI/MRA, her acute mental status change was unlikely
related to a stroke.  At the outside hospital, there was also a
concern for HSV meningitis, though an HSV PCR returned negative.
 She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and
vancomycin.  She was continued on ceftriaxone and vancomycin and
ampicillin was added for listeria.  Infectious Disease was
consulted and they recommended discontinuation of Vancomycin.
They felt the clinical history was most consistent with
listeria, though the patient's CSF cultures at the outside
hospital remained negative.

Her initial exam was concerning for decreased brainstem function
given the lack of occulocephalic reflex and lack of corneal
reflexes.  Therefore, she was sedated with propofol while she
was intubated so that her neurological function could be
monitored easily.  Given her persistent decreased neurological
function on hospital day 2, Neurology was consulted.  Dilantin
was restarted given the possibility of seizures secondary to
irritation from meningoencephalitis.  An EEG showed diffuse
slowing with frontal temporal sharp features consistent with
encephalopathy without evidence of epileptiform activity.  A
repeat head CT showed multiple hypodense lesions consistent with
early abscess.  Serum cryptoccal and lyme serologies were
negative.  Repeat MRI revealed multiple foci of slow diffusion
involving both cerebellar hemispheres and cerebral hemispheres
predominantly involving the parietooccipital lobes. Findings
were indicative of multiple acute infarcts and thought likely to
be related to inflammation from meningitis causing vasospasms.
Although the infarcts were considered likely related to
inflammation,  there was a theoretical concern for endocarditis
and septic emboli. The patient had a TTE which revealed no
valvular vegetations. A TEE was attempted, but the patient's
posterior oropharynx was small and she had a desaturation event
during the procedure.  Both infectious disease and neurology
felt the concern for endocarditis was so low that it did not
warrant intubating and sedating the patient for a repeat TEE.

An LP was repeated and revealed resolution of the pleocytosis,
normal protein and normal glucose with negative cultures.
Neurology suggested MRI of the patient's cervical and thoracic
spine given the concern for the infarcts and seeding of her
spine.  This was also attempted, but given claustrophobia, the
patient did not tolerate the MRI.  These have been schedule at
an open MRI facility after discharge. The patient's mental
status improved dramatically throughout her hospitalization.

2.  Hypotension/sepsis: The patient was hypotensive on transfer
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU.  Her hypotension was attributed to sepsis
given her elevated lactate and white count.  She was transfered
on dopamine 5mcg/kg/min and levophed 0.175mcg/kg/min with a CVP
low at 8.  She responded well to fluid boluses and her pressors
were weaned off within the first 24 hours of her admission.  A
cortisol stimulation test showed adequate adrenal function.  She
did not require fluid boluses after 48 hours.

3.  Acute renal failure: The patient was admitted with a
creatinine of 3.9. Her renal failure was attributed to ATN in
the setting of hypoperfusion and sepsis.  Her urine sediment was
positive for muddy brown casts.  Her medications were renally
dosed.  Her creatinine improved to 1.1 by discharge and her
urine output picked up considerably as she mobilized her total
body fluid and her kidneys recovered.

4.  DM2:  On transfer, the patient was initially hyperglycemic
and required an insulin drip to control her sugars in the
setting of the acute infection.  During the first 24-48 hours,
she was transitioned to an insuli
