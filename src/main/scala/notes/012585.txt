Chief Complaint:
Cough, tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
66yoM with Afib on Coumadin, HTN, DM, DLP presenting with cough
and tachycardia, admitted to the MICU for tachypnea.
.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 91508**] for
cough and lightheadedness, and diagnosed with RUL, RML, RLL, and
LLL multifocal pneumonia and dehydration. In brief, the
patient's symptoms began 2 weeks ago with a cough productive of
yellow sputum. He was seen at his primary care physician's
office the week prior and had a CXR that was reportedly
negative. He was diagnosed with bronchitis and given an inhaler.
However, he continued to have wheezing, lethargy, and fatigue
and his cough evolved into a non-productive cough. He was
febrile at home to 102. He also had decreased po intake and
decreased po hydration, and had felt lightheaded on exertion for
the past several days. He presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-15**] for
lightheadedness when walking up a flight of stairs and was
admitted for a multifocal pneumonia. He was treated with a 5 day
course of Levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia, as his
two presentations to his outpatient PCP were [**Name9 (PRE) 91509**] based
community clinics. Urine Legionella antigen returned negative.
He was also initially hypotensive in the 80's-90's and was given
IVF hydration with NS with improvement of blood pressures. His
home anti-hypertensives including Labetalol and Diltiazem were
held in the setting of initial hypotension due to dehydration,
but re-started prior to discharge.
.
The patient was discharged on [**2-16**] and followed up with his PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-17**]. He reported a fever of 101.4 the night prior to
presentation as well as dyspnea on exertion, and was found to
have a a PO2 of 88-90% on RA at his PCP's office. He was placed
on 4L NC with improvement of PO2 to 95%. He was also tachycardic
with HR in the 120's at rest, which increased to the 170's with
exertion, and was sent to the ED. The patient notes he had
forgotten to take his morning Labetolol and Diltiazem.
.
Of note, the patient was seen in primary care clinic twice in
the past month and was also on Doxycycline for rosacea for the
past 4 weeks.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.9 98 146/83 22 98% 4L
He was noted to be tachypneic in the 30's, and CXR showed
increased multifocal infiltrates compare to prior. He was found
to be tachycardic in the 120's-130's at rest and increased to
170 bpm with the exertion of urinating. EKG reportedly showed AF
@111 bpm, NA/NI, no acutes ST changes, c/w prior. Repeat EKG
showed HR in the 140's without ST changes. He received 3L IVF
and antibiotics were broadened to Vanc 1gm, Zosyn, Azithromycin.
He was also given Benzonatate and Acetaminophen 650 mg. He was
also given his home labetalol dose and short acting diltiazem 30
mg. BP's were in the 160's.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient reports labored breathing
compared to baseline but denies respiratory distress. He denies
other complaints.
.
The patient was stabilized and transfered to the floor. When
talking to the patient, he feels well except for continued
dyspnea on exertion and a O2 requirement of 6L NC. The patient
can talk in full sentences and he is not using accessory muscles
to breathe. He looks comfortable. He denies chest pain,
palpitations, lightheadedness, or confusion.
