HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39 year old
male with a past medical history of chronic myelogenous
leukemia, status post unrelated allogeneic bone marrow
transplant that has been complicated by chronic graft-versus-
host disease (hypopigmentation, mild ulceration, and
thrombocytopenia).  The patient states that he began feeling
unwell approximately nine days prior to admission but
worsened significantly over the weekend prior to admission,
specifically complaining of fever to 101, complicated by
myalgias, fatigue and an unproductive cough as well as
shortness of breath.  He was seen in the [**Hospital 3242**] Clinic on
[**4-24**], at which time he had an ANC of 3700 and a chest
film that did not reveal any infiltrate.  He was seen in
clinic today as a follow up with an unchanged chest film but
found to be hypoxic to approximately 89 percent on room air.
He denies any headache, rhinorrhea, pleuritic chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, changes in bowel or bladder
habits.  Of note the patient was  noted to have a flare of his
graft- versus- host disease flare ([**2149-1-6**]). He was seen
by pulmonary who felt he had a component of Bronchlitis
obliterans  and was treated with Prednisone 40 mg which was
tapered slowly back down to 5 mg last month.  The symptoms
appeared to develop approximately one week after having tapered
down to 5 mg, in particular the muscle aches, pain, fatigue and
low-grade fever.  This progressed to a dry cough and worsened
fever as above.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is
notable for chronic myelogenous leukemia.  It was diagnosed
in [**2146-12-8**].  He is status post a match-unrelated
allogeneic bone marrow transplant in [**2147-10-8**].  It has
been complicated by graft-versus-host disease as mentioned
above as well as cytomegalovirus colitis, bronchiolitis
obliterans-organizing pneumonia, hemolytic uremic syndrome,
and mouth ulcers as well as thrombocytopenia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  The patient's medications on
admission are Prednisone 5 mg q. day and Acyclovir 400 mg
p.o. b.i.d., Pentamidine q. month and folic acid q. day.

ALLERGIES:  His allergies are to Amphotericin and to
Ampicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married, works as a computer
analyst.  He works with his wife and three children.  He has
no history of tobacco use or intravenous drug use.  He does
not drink alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for the absence of cancer or lung
disease.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed
sodium 141, potassium 3.7, chloride 105, bicarbonate 26, BUN
19, creatinine 1.6, glucose 86.  His white count is 7.4 with
46 percent neutrophils and 7 percent bands as well as 99
percent  lymphocytes.  Hematocrit is 26.1 and platelets are
27.  His ALT is 39, AST is 54.  His alkaline phosphatase is
101, creatinine 1.0.  Chest film does not reveal any evidence
of infiltrate or effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Pneumonia - A high resolution chest
computerized tomography scan did not reveal any acute
changes, though the nasal swabs were positive for respiratory
syncytial virus.  The patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for aerosolized Ribavirin and Synagis
treatment.  The patient received one dose of Synagis as well
as a course of Ribavirin therapy which he tolerated well.
The patient received five days of Ribavirin in all.  The
patient defervesced and had improved oxygenation.  A repeat
viral culture from a repeat nasopharyngeal aspirate again
revealed respiratory syncytial virus.  Infectious disease
consult was obtained for further assistance.  Follow up chest
computerized tomography scan was essentially unchanged from
the prior admission study.  Again, noted were bronchial wall
thickening and scarring of the right lower lobe that was
unchanged from the prior study with no significant air
trapping and no adenopathy.  Overall there was no
computerized tomography scan evidence for acute infectious
process or inflammatory process.  However, given the
patient's immunocompromised status and out of concern for
possible superimposed bronchitis or pneumonia, the patient
was treated with a seven day course of Levofloxacin in
addition to the treatment for his Ribavirin.  The patient's
cytomegalovirus viral load was found to be negative. His
prednisone dose was also increased to 40mg qd.

Thrombocytopenia - The patient has thrombocytopenia which is
thought to be secondary to chronic graft-versus-host disease.
The patient's platelets on admission were 27.  The patient
received platelets on [**5-1**], as well as on [**4-29**], one
unit.

Graft-versus-host disease - The patient has a history of
bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia.  There was
concern that his hypoxia in addition to being caused by
respiratory syncytial virus infection may also have had an
component of graft-versus-host disease as well, in particular
given the drop in his platelet count on admission.  Therefore
Prednisone dose was increased to 40 mg q. day and was tapered
slowly.  The patient's Prednisone dose is 30 mg at the time
of discharge.

Anemia - The patient's hematocrit is stable over the course
of hospitalization.  His hematocrit on admission was 29, the
patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**5-1**], and his hematocrit remained stable.

Chronic renal insufficiency - The patient had an elevated
creatinine on admission of 1.6.  It is felt that his baseline
creatinine is 1.1 to 1.2.  Etiology was unclear for his
elevated creatinine on admission.  The patient was discharged
in stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory syncytial virus.
Extensive chronic GVHD.
Pneumonia.

Status post allogeneic bone marrow transplant with extensive
chronic graft-versus-host disease.

Anemia.

Thrombocytopenia.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with his oncologist
following discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Acyclovir 400 mg p.o. q. 12.
2. Folic acid 1 mg q. day.
3. Protonix 40 mg q. day.
4. Levofloxacin 500 mg q. day to complete his seven day
   course.
5. Prednisone
