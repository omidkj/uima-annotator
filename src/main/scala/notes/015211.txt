Admission Date: [**2172-1-27**]        Discharge Date: [**2172-2-4**]

Date of Birth:  [**2092-2-5**]        Sex:  F

Service:  NSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old
woman with a complaint of left eye swelling, pain, and
redness since [**Month (only) 404**].  It had gotten worse over the past
three days.  She presented to [**Hospital 878**] Clinic for concerns
for a caroticocavernous fistula.  She complained of blurry
vision.  No diplopia.  She has had problems with balance and
falling forward.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake, alert, and oriented
times three.  The left eye is proptotic.  Pupils are equal,
round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements full.
The patient does have nystagmus with right lateral gaze and
diplopia with right lateral gaze.  Face is symmetric.  Tongue
is midline.  No drift.  Strength is [**4-16**] in all muscle groups.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
neurosurgical service.  She was seen by the ophthalmology
service proptosis of the left eye.  The patient was seen by
ophthalmology service and compartment syndrome was ruled out.
The patient's pressures were high on the left side, 22 mmHg
as opposed to 12 mmHg in the right eye.

The patient had an indirect carotid-cavernous fistula of the
left external carotid artery resulting in dilatation of the
superior ophthalmic vein and arterialization of the left
cavernous sinus. On [**2172-1-28**], the patient had coil
embolization of this fistula using a retrograde transvenous
approach. This was deemed to be successful with no evidence
of residual shunting that could be seen angiographically at
the end of the procedure.  There were no intraoperative
complications.

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in the recovery
room.  Ophthalmology saw the patient postoperatively and the
patient had better intraocular pressure.  They recommended
Lacri-Lube and follow up in two days.  Postoperatively, the
patient was awake and alert.  Speech was fluent.  The
patient's strength was [**4-16**] in all muscle groups.  Pupils were
equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
were full.

On [**2172-1-29**] on examination, the patient developed a partial
left sixth nerve palsy with worsening proptosis of the left
eye with a significant bruit.  The patient was taken back to
angiography.  Ophthalmology was called to see the patient
urgently prior to going to angiography.  They felt the
pressure was normal.  The patient was taken back to
angiography.  Angiography at this point revealed a small
residual recanalization of the fistula just proximal to the
coil mass through a pocket in the cavernous sinus that was
difficult to reach from a transvenous approach.  Additional coils
were placed transvenously as well as a trasnsvenous NBCA
injection which was successful in interrupting the last evidence
of AV shunting.

In addition, cerebral angiography of the right carotid system
revealed an unrelated dural AVF involving the anterior portion
of the superior sagittal sinus which appears to have a variceal
dilatation of the draining venous system.  This was identified
as another lesion that needs treatment in order to avoid the
risk of venous hemorrhage.

Postoperatively, the patient was awake, alert and oriented
times three.  Pupils were equal, round and reactive to light.
There was improvement of her left sixth nerve palsy in the
left eye with a decrease in bruit and decreased double and
blurry vision.  The patient remained neurologically stable.
She was monitored in the intensive care unit overnight and
transferred to the step-down unit on postprocedure day number
one.  She was out of bed ambulating, tolerating a regular
diet, and voiding spontaneously.  She was seen by physical
therapy and occupational therapy and found to be safe for
discharge home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Decadron 1 mg p.o. every twelve hours, to wean off over
   two days.
2. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously three times a day,
   discontinue before discharge.
3. Prazosin 20 mg p.o. twice a day.
4. Artificial Tears to the left eye four times a day and at
   bedtime.
5. Diltiazem extended release 240 mg p.o. once a day.
6. Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
7. Lasix 40 mg p.o. once a day.
8. Fluticasone salmeterol inhaler 100/50 one inhale twice a
   day.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient's condition was stable
at the time of discharge.


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in two
weeks for a repeat angiography to verify the state of the left
carotid-cavernous fistula and treat the unrelated right dural
AV fistula.
