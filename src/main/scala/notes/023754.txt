Chief Complaint:
Admitted for Cycle 1 of MEC

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement [**2116-10-2**]

History of Present Illness:
61 yo woman with history of breast CA and subsequent development
of AML s/p allo HSCT on [**2115-10-4**] who recently had episodes of
back pain X2months and MRI revealed an L2 lesion that was found
to be a chloroma, concerning for extramedullary relapse. Bone
marrow done last week on prelim read was also positive for AML.
She had been scheduled for radiation to the spine and planned
DLI. However, with positive bone marrow, she is now being
admitted for MEC. Patient with lower back pain, hip pain (R>L)
radiating down the legs. No numbness or tingling typically. Pain
is intermittent, but constant since last night. Gait feels
unsteady. Denies fevers, chills, no weight loss >2 pounds. Not
sure if having night sweats. Appetite decreased but eating
normally currently. No changes in BMs.
.
Of note, patient with tooth pain recently. 1st molar on left
painful after biting into a tums. Now right first molar also
sensitive. Pain in L>R. No HA, double vision. H/o possible TMJ.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied
cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or
abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias, rashes.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- [**2102**] TAH/BSO showed stage IIB ovarian Ca adjuvant treatment
with six cycles of carboplatin and Taxol
- [**2113-12-7**] had mammogram that showed a poorly
differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, 8 mm in largest
diameter, without LVI. ER/PR/HER-2 negative. FNA of a palpable
right axillary lymph node was consistent with malignancy.
Imaging showed right axillary, subpectoral, and deep cervical
lymph node involvement.
- [**2114-2-4**] treated with Adriamycin and Cytoxan followed by
Taxol at the [**Company 2860**] followed by bilateral mastectomies(right
modified radical mastectomy and left simple mastectomy) at [**Hospital1 2025**].
Pathology from the right breast demonstrated LCIS, chemotherapy
changes, and no evidence of residual IDC. Zero of 24 right
axillary lymph nodes were positive for disease. There was no
evidence of cancer in the left breast.
- genetic testing negative for BRCA-1 and 2 mutations.
- [**2115-4-4**], she developed new lower back pain while undergoing
planning for bilateral breast reconstruction surgery. Initially
managed conservatively. Her pain progressed, and on [**2115-6-4**], she presented to the emergency room at [**Hospital3 **]. Blood work at the hospital demonstrated a CBC that was
notable for
white blood cell count of 19, hematocrit 23, and a platelet
count
of 12. White blood cell count differential was notable for 11%
blasts. At that time, she endorsed easy bruising, but denied
fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, or recurrent
infections. She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where she

underwent bone marrow biopsy on [**2115-6-7**], with findings
consistent with AML with monocytic differentiation. On [**2115-6-8**], she began induction chemotherapy with 7+3. Her treatment
course was complicated by prolonged neutropenic fevers,
multifocal pneumonia requiring lung biopsy that demonstrated
evidence of BOOP. She was subsequently treated with steroids.
Bone marrow biopsy performed on day +14 and day +24 showed
residual blasts in the marrow, and she was treated with one
cycle
of HiDAC. Bone marrow biopsy on [**2115-7-16**], showed no
evidence of blasts. She was subsequently discharged, but had
several short stays in the hospital for difficulties with
infections. On [**2115-9-27**], she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for

ablative allogeneic stem cell transplant from a matched
unrelated
donor. She underwent conditioning with fludarabine, busulfan,
and ATG. Her transplant was on [**2115-10-4**]. She did well
following the transplant, with no evidence of recurrent disease

or graft-versus-host disease. In [**2116-7-3**], she once again began

to develop low back pain with occasional radiation down her
legs.
An L-spine MRI on [**2116-7-31**], demonstrated a new enhancing L2

spinous process mass with associated soft tissue component and
no
spinal canal involvement. There was also new heterogeneous
marrow signal noted in the iliac bone and sacrum. Pelvis MRI on

[**2116-8-6**], once again demonstrated diffuse marrow signal
abnormality with near complete homogenous replacement of the
right posterior ilium to SI joint, and marrow replacement of the
left femur to the mid diaphysis. There were also bilateral
sacral insufficiency fractures noted. On [**2116-8-17**], she
underwent bone marrow biopsy, which demonstrated a mildly
hypocellular marrow with no evidence of AML. Flow cytometry was

negative for evidence of blasts. On [**2116-8-25**], she
underwent an FNA of this newly identified left spinous process
mass. Pathology demonstrated skeletal muscle and soft tissue
with an atypical mononuclear infiltrate consistent with myeloid

sarcoma. Immunohistochemistry staining was positive for CD4, 15,
33, 43, and 68 (similar to her previous AML). This was felt to
represent an extramedullary relapse of her AML.
-Bone marrow biopsy last week ([**9-/2116**]) was positive for AML.
-patient is being admitted for MEC chemo therapy given extent of
relapse
