Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Acetabular fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2-15**] - Left hip percutaneous fixation of acetabular fracture


History of Present Illness:
81 y/o male from OSH s/p slip and fall on ice while walking out
of home. Pt presented initially to OSH where he was found to
have an acetabular fracture. He was afebrile, 98/72 100, satting
97%RA. Patient was given morphine 1mg q15m prn pain and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. He triggered on arrival for 77/52 HR 69 in
Afib but responded to fluids. The pt became tachycardic to 140s
in afib w/RVR and dropped his pressures down to the 70s. He was
cardioverted twice, at 100J and 200J -> briefly in sinus with
bigeminy. He received 4L NS and 1u pRBCs. Because of his
hypotension, he got zosyn. BCx sent, U/a clean. CXR showed low
left lung volume with surrounding pleural thickening and
calcified pleural plaques, consistent with prior asbestos
exposure. He was also given Vitamin K 10mg IV. Comfortable with
blood pressure 91/51, HR 85, RR 18, 100% NRB. No respiratory
complaints. Ortho and trauma consulted.  Non-con CT showed L
acetabular fx near L common fem and sm amt of free fluid in
pelvis.
 .
On the floor, patient found to be 80s-100s/40s-50s, HR 80s-90s,
satting 99% on 5L nc. Patient A&Ox3, states baseline sbps
80s-100s. Denies CP, palpitations. States SOB is at baseline as
well. Does endorse [**2-12**] hip pain at rest with significant
increase with movement.

Imaging:
CT HEAD:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
2. Chronic involutional changes.
.
CT A/P:
1. Severely comminuted fracture of the left acetabulum, ischium
and ilium.
2. Hemorrhage in left and anterior pelvis, without evidence of
active extravasation.
3. 3.3 cm infrarenal AAA.
4. Left-sided pleural scarring/calcification, in conjunction
with liver and splenic calcifications. This is most consistent
with granulomatous infection (e.g. TB), differential diagnosis
includes prior trauma with resolved hemothorax, and asbestos
exposure.
5. Cholelithiasis, without acute cholecystitis.
.
X-ray Pelvis:
IMPRESSION: Comminuted, displaced fracture of the left
acetabulum, also with involvement of the left ilium and ischium.
The left femoral head appears intact. No diastasis of the pubic
symphysis or sacroiliac joints.
.
CT SPINE: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture
2. Reversal of cervical lordosis centered at C6-7, with severe
multilevel degenerative changes.
3. Moderate left apical pleural thickening, secondary to known
asbestos
exposure. Recommend comparison with prior studies/chest
radiographs to assess for interval change in pleural thickening
to exclude a more agressive process.
.
ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior and septal
hypo- to akinesis. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining
segments (LVEF = 25-30%), however the overall LV systolic
function may be UNDERestimated in the context of tachycardia.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring
is present. The prosthesis cannot be adequately assessed. A
tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is present. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR: ([**2-17**]): One view. Comparison with the previous study done,
[**2153-2-16**]. Calcified pleural thickening is noted on the left and
there is volume loss in the left lung as before. There is
interval clearing of right lung infiltrates and improvement in
subsegmental atelectasis on that side. The patient is status
post median sternotomy as before. Mediastinal structures are
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Clearing of pulmonary infiltrates likely due to
resolution of congestive heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 year-old male with history of atrial fibrillation on
coumadin, systolic heart failure who presented with hypotension
and atrial fibrillation with RVR after acetabular fracture.
.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient was started on
amiodarone load upon admission.  He intermittently converted to
normal sinus rhythm, then reverted back into atrial fibrillation
with rates in 120s.  Following the amiodarone load, the patient
was restarted on metoprolol, and titrated up to 75 mg PO QID.
For anticoagulation, the patient was started on heparin drip
(CHADS2 of 4) as his coumadin was stopped on admission given his
fracture.  Post-op the patient's heparin drip was held for 24
hours and restarted on POD #1 ([**2153-2-16**]).  Coumadin was
restarted at 1mg PO daily (lower than home dose given
interaction with amiodarone), and uptititrated to 2 mg at
discharge. His INR will need to be monitored at rehab facility.
INR at discharge was 2.4. Recommend alternating dose of coumadin
between 1 mg and 2mg daily. Consideration was given to
discontinuation of amiodarone in favor of digoxin given his
underlying lung disease.
.
# Acetabular fracture: Patient was taken to the OR by orthopedic
service on [**2153-2-15**] for stablization of his left acetabulum/hip.
Pt remained non-weight bearing following procedure.  Started on
IV dilaudid and oxycodone, and pain was well-controlled
throughout. He was touch down weight bearing the left lower
extremity at discharge per ortho recommendations. Patient will
need outpatient orthopedic follow-up in two weeks following
discharge.
