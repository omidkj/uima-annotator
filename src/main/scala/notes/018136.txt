Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Stroke in the setting of cardiac cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization, failed angioplasty

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34909**] is an 86 year old man with a hx of CAD s/p CABG in
[**2143**], PCI with DESx3 to SVG-OM in [**2157**] who was referred for
urgent cardiac cath in the setting of increasing anginal
symptoms.  Per OMR, the patient has been experiencing chest and
back pain for the past month occurring at rest and with
exertion.
He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in early [**Month (only) **] and his Imdur was
increased to 120mg daily. Since then he has continued to have
increasing chest pain at rest, including 2 episodes on [**2160-10-2**]
requiring several nitroglycerin for relief.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified and has recommended urgent urgent catheterization. Per
the patient's family, he has otherwise been in his usual state
of health lately.
.
In the cath lab, balloon angioplasty was performed to the OM2,
an intervention was about to be performed on the OM1, but the
patient suddenly woke up and was aphasic. Stroke team called,
patient sent for CTA of the head, which showed no bleed or
visible occlusion.  In the cath lab, he was started on a
bivalirudin drip, but transitioned to a heparin drip at the
advice of the stroke team.

Upon stroke consult, initial exam was remarkable for
significantly impaired speech with some preserved repetition of
short words but otherwise unintelligible. Also had R facial
droop and some difficulty with fine movements of R hand but
otherwise full strength throughout. CT head showed no acute
intracranial process and CTA showed no major vessel occlusion.
MRI performed [**10-4**] showed bilateral partial small middle
cerebral artery territorial infarcts. Transferred to the
neurology service for further management.

CT/CTA [**2160-10-3**]:
1. Head CT shows no evidence of hemorrhage. No definite loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation seen. Small vessel disease and brain
atrophy noted.
2. CT angiography of the neck demonstrates calcification in both
carotid
bifurcations, but no evidence of high-grade stenosis. The right
vertebral
artery is only faintly visualized.
3. CT angiography of the head demonstrates some evidence of
decreased
branching in the region of left middle and left sylvian fissure
which could be secondary to an evolving infarct or slow flow in
the region. Subsequent MRI can help for further assessment to
exclude infarct in this location and clinical correlation is
also recommended. There is no evidence of occlusion of main
vascular structures seen. Calcification is seen in the left
vertebral artery and mild atherosclerotic disease is seen in the
basilar artery.

Brain MRI [**2160-10-4**]: There are areas of restricted diffusion seen
bilaterally in the frontal lobes in the distribution of the
middle cerebral artery indicative of small bilateral partial
middle cerebral artery territorial infarcts. There is no
evidence of hemorrhage seen. There is brain atrophy seen. There
is no midline shift. Soft tissue changes seen in the right
maxillary sinus.

TTE 10/3/1:
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild-moderate aortic
regurgitation. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery hypertension. Dilated thoracic aorta. No definite cardiac
source of embolism identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34909**] was admitted on [**10-3**] and was brought to the cardiac
cath lab for angioplasty to relieve anginal symptoms. In the
cath lab, he developed difficulty speaking and the procedure was
halted before the angioplasty was completed. The stroke service
was consulted.

Upon stroke consult, initial exam was remarkable for
significantly impaired speech with some preserved repetition of
short words but otherwise unintelligible. Also had R facial
droop and some difficulty with fine movements of R hand but
otherwise full strength throughout. CT head showed no acute
intracranial process and CTA showed no major vessel occ
