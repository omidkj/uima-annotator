Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 81 yo female with hx type 2 DM, hyperlipidemia, +50
pack year tobacco abuse history, PVD who presented with dyspnea,
new onset afib and decompensated systolic CHF.

#PUMP
Patient initially presented w/ CHF symtoms and was diuresed as
well as rate controlled for new onset atrial fibrillation.  Rate
control was likely overzealous, and given low ejection fraction
in setting of structural heart disease, patient experienced
hypotension and systemic hypoperfusion.  Echo in setting of
decompensation on revealed severely depressed EF (10-20%) with
global hypokinesis and relative akinesis of the septum and basal
inferior walls as well as 4+ TR and 2+ MR.  She was transferred
to the CCU for management of CHF in setting of renal failure,
and rising liver function tests.  The initial differential in
the CCU included sepsis (broad spectrum antibiotics were
initiated), CHF (lasix was given), viral / other hepatitis
(supportive care given).  A swan ganz catheter was placed in the
CCU and revealed a low-normal cardiac index and normal SVR.
Patient was observed and nodal agents were witheld; gentle
diuresis was also continued for overloaded state.  Diagnosis of
ARF and shock liver were made given sustained hypotension and
bradycardia in setting of systemic decompensation.  Renal
function and LFT's returned toward baseline as SBP's and HR
increased.  Broad spectrum antiobotics were discontinued.
Digoxin 0.0625 mg and lisinopril 20 mg daily were started for
CHF. Lisinopril was increased to 40mg daily.  Metoprolol was
also given, however this was discontinued since it was thought
to contribute to impaired respiratory status / wheezing. Patient
was put back on her home lotensin for discharge.

#. Rhythm -
Patient presented with atrial fibrillation and subsequently was
converted to sinus bradycardia with nodal agents.  Beta blockade
was initially used for rate control however was discontinued
given respiratory status. It was restarted on the day prior to
discharge at low dose. Heparin was initiated for paroxysmal afib
and used to bridge coumadin until INR was >2. The patient will
continue coumadin with INR checks as outpatient. PT also noted
to have prolonged QT interval, stable, was recommended to
continue to follow as an outpatient.

#. CAD / Ischemia - Patient has not had a "known" MI, however
presents with EKG findings such as inferior and lateral q's on
EKG as well as ventricular hypokinesis on echo which signify
likely CAD.  ASA was initiated as well as beta blockade; the BB
was stopped for above mentioned reasons and restarted.

#Transaminitis
As mentioned LFTs began to increase on hospital day 2 and peaked
in the thousands on hospital day 3.  Subsequently they trended
down. Hepatitis serologies were sent and were negative except
for HAV IgG positivity. HAV IgM was negative. The transaminitis
was considered secondary to prolonged hypotension in setting of
acute decompensation.

#. Dyspnea/Hypoxia
Patient became quite hypoxic initially. In the CCU patient was
considered to have a COPD flare (despite lack of hx of COPD,
extensive smoking abuse and exam suggested otherwise) as well as
cardiogenic wheezing from failure.  Diuresis was performed as
mentioned.  For suspected COPD flare the patient was initiated
on levofloxacin and a prednisone taper starting at 60 mg daily.
Levofloxacin was changed to doxycycline given risks of QT
prolongation. The patient was restarted on lasix 20mg po daily
prior to discharge. Patient will need to complete 3 additional
days of 20mg PO prednisone at home.

#. ARF / Hyperkalemia
Patient had an increasing creatinine (max 2.0, baseline 1.0)
level during decompensation which was also considered [**1-31**]
hypotension and pre-renal causes.  Renal ultrasound was
negative.  Creatinine trended down as heart function improved.
Patient initially experienced hyperkalemia (up to max 7.3,
without ekg changes) and was treated appropriately.  As renal
function improved along with diuresis, K returned to [**Location 213**] and
occasionally required supplementation.

#. DM
Initially patient had poorly controlled BS in setting of
decompensation (BS > 400).  An insulin gtts was initiated and
then converted to lantus / humalog sliding scale with good
control. She later developed hypoglycemia and her dose of lantus
was decreased to 18UQHS. We are discharging her on 10U of lantus
as she will be completing her prednisone taper.

#. Hypothyroidism
Home synthroid was continued.

#. Anemia
Stable normocytic anemia; outpatient f/u is appropriate.

#. Depression
Home meds of Lexapro, Seroquel, Lithium were withheld initially
during decompensa
