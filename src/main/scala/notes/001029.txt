[**1-21**] TEE
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve is functionally bicuspid (fusion of the right and
left coronary leaflets). There is a echodensity seen at the tips
of the aortic valve leaflets that measures 0.7 x 0.8 cm and
could reporesent a vegetation or partial flail leaflet. This is
best seen in clips 77, 78 and 81 (also 10,13, 28, 31, 37-47).
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Probable moderate sized vegetation on bicuspid
aortic valve. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation. No intracardiac
shunt identified. Normal global left ventricular systolic
function.


Brief Hospital Course:
28 yo F with no significant PMHx who presented with 4 days of
influenza-like illness and developed ARDS requiring intubation
[**1-16**]. Extubated successfully on [**1-19**]. Found to have endocarditis
& severe (4+) aortic regurgitation.
.
# Culture-negative endocarditis: Patient found to have moderate
sized vegatation on bicuspid aortic valve. Likely embolic source
of occipital lobe infarct. Cardiac surgery recommends
re-evaluation after antibiotic course is complete in 6 weeks.
Patient was discharged on ceftriaxone, gentamicin & daptomycin.
Microbiology was pending at discharge, but patient will follow
up with Infectious Disease clinic as an outpatient.
.
# Jaw dislocation: Completely resolved. Patient's jaw was
dislocated during TEE. Dental consult reset it and placed brace.
Patient currently denies any jaw pain or discomfort. Dental team
recommended a soft diet & jaw brace x 1 week
.
# Occipital lobe embolic infarct: Head MRI showed left occipital
lobe infarct which occurred within the past week per radiology.
Etiology of septic embolus likely vegetation on aortic valve.
Patient had no focal neurologic symptoms or visual field
defects.
.
# Anemia: DIC & hemolysis labs were negative in ICU. Possibly
secondary marrow suppression from acute illness. Other cell
lines were initially low, but recovered.
.
# Depression/Anxiety: Patient has anxiety which occasionally
manifested as sinus tachycardia. Continued her buspirone,
lamotrigine and clonazepam.
