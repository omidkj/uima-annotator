Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**2140-5-16**] s/p high speed MVC.  He was
intubated prior to arrival.  He had a small subdural hematoma,
left pneumothorax, b/l 1st rib fractures, left inferior ramus
fracture, left acetabular fracture, small splenic lac. He was
started on dilantin, got a chest tube and an ortho and
neurosurgery consult were called.  He was transfered to the TICU
in stable condition and remained intubated.  A repeat head CT
was stable.  He was extubated on HD 2 but had to be reintubated
due to poor mental status and inability to protect the airway.
He remained stable and was kept intubated in the TICU and ortho
took him to the OR on HD 4 for ORIF for acetabular fracture.  He
had a noncomplicated operative course and was returned to the
TICU in stable condition.  He was started on tube feeds postop.
He remained stable but was kept intubated due to poor mental
status recovery.  On HD7 his chest tube was d/ced and his chest
xray remained stable.  On POD 4 he was started on kefzol for a
wound infection.  On HD 10 the patient's family agreed to
proceed with a tracheostomy.  He had a noncomplicated
percutaneous trach tube placement with a stable f/u chest xray.
He was extubated and put on trach mask the following day and
remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint.  However, his
mental status failed to recover.  He also developed a small
bowel obstruction and the tube feeds were held.  The family did
not wish to proceed with a gastric feeding tube or a PICC line
for enteral nutrition, so he was started on PPN for nutritional
support.  An NG tube was placed for gastric decompression, but
he pulled the tube twice and was briefly transfered to the ICU
due to question of aspiration.  A family meeting was held and it
was determined that we would not proceed with any increase in
the level of care for the patient.  He was made CMO status on
[**2140-6-1**] after a palliative care consult and a long family
discussion.  He remained stable after this and was transfered to
a long term palliative care facility on [**2140-6-3**].
