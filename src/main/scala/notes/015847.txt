coffee-ground emesis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
PI: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 88-year-old woman with dementia,
hypertension, anxiety, and recurrent UTI's who presents from her
nursing home ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Nursing Care Center) with 1 episode of
coffee-ground emesis, during which she reportedly became
diaphoretic and dropped her sats. Per nursing home notes, she
was alert with some confusion at 10:30 pm on the night prior to
admission. She had an episode of vomitting undigested food, her
heart rate went to 130 with O2 sat of 91% and otherwise stable
vitals. She then had another episode of vomiting "dark
coffee-ground color" emesis, again tachycardic to 110. She was
at this time noted to be pale with blue lips and chills. She was
given a neb treatment for sats to 88% and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial vitals: T 99, HR 94, BP 106/58, RR 18, sat
100% 4L. She had an NG lavage with coffee grounds but
subsequently cleared. Initial labs were significant for Hct
40.5, normal coags, Trop 0.05 with negative CK/MB, renal
function 27/1.0, lactate 3.8, WBC count 11.4 with 15% bandemia.
About 7 hours later, her Hct was noted to be to 34.2 and Trop
now 0.07. CXR was concerning for RML consolidation. EKG was
concerning for ST depressions in V2-V6, I, II, aVL and <[**Street Address(2) 4793**]
elevations in III. She was not having chest pain and was not
given an ASA due to the GIB.

Pt has been given Protonix 40mg (80mg?) IV and then gtt. She
received 1L IV normal saline, but it is unclear if she received
RBC transfusion. GI was consulted and recommended IVF, NPO, and
serial hematocrits. She has an active T&S and PIV's x2, 18g in
her R and L wrists.

The pt reportedly had bp's as low as the high 90's/50's, but
vitals before transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] were: HR 87, BP 115/57, RR 14,
sat 98% 2L.

Of note, patient lives at nursing home largely because of
dementia, waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, and dependency for most
ADLs and IADLs. Per her nephew and healthcare proxy, she has
moments of clarity, but her short-term memory overall is very
poor. She does not walk due to severe spinal osteoarthritis and
pain with standing.
