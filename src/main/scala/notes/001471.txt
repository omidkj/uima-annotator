Cardiac Cath

History of Present Illness:
48 yo male with history of HTN and dyslipidemia experienced
intermittent chest pain throughout the day of admission and the
day prior; at 11pm it became more severe and did not resolve in
the usual fashion; he called 911 and was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED. Pt reports that on the morning of [**9-10**] he experienced the
sudden onset of [**7-7**] pain in his posterior neck radiating down
his left arm, it then spread to involve his chest and was a
pressure-like sensation worse with breathing. It began at rest,
lasted a few minutes and then completely resolved. He states
that he had never experienced pain like this. This recurred
several times throughout the day.
.
On the day of admission ([**9-11**]), the pt had similar episodes
starting at rest. After dinner, his pain evolved into [**9-6**]
chest pain with involvement of the left arm. This pain made it
very hard to breathe and was so strong that it "stopped him from
walking." Pt went home, noted that the pain was not resolving
and called 911.
.
Pt received ASA 325mg and nitro in the field (dosage/relief
uncertain). In the ED, his vitals were afebrile, HR=80,
BP=125/80, 100% on RA. His SBPs dropped from 130s to 90s. Pt
received 02, 5mgx3 lopressor, Plavix 600mg, Heparin bolus, and
morphine. Nitro was held for SBP less than 100. His EKG showed
NSR with lateral ST elevations and reciprocal changes. Initial
troponin was 0.08 and CK: 439 MB: 10 MBI: 2.3. Pt was taken to
cath lab were a DES was placed for 100% occlusion of the
proximal LAD.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. he denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for previous absence of
chest pain on exertion, absence of dyspnea on exertion, and
good/unchanged exercise tolerance. Until 6 months ago, he ran
6km per day.

ECHO [**2165-9-12**]: The left atrium is normal in size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30-40) secondary to akinesis of the anterior
septum, anterior free wall, and apex. The posterior wall is
hyperdynamic. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild to moderate ([**11-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: extensive
anteroapical myocardial infarct
.
RENAL ULTRASOUND  [**2165-9-14**]:
1) No hydronephrosis or renal mass is identified.
2) Equivocal mass in the bladder, which might represent
prominant median lobe of the prostate. Correlate with prior
imaging if available; in not available, MR pelvis suggested
without/with contrast to exclude neoplasm given history of new
onset hematuria.


Brief Hospital Course:
48 year old male with STEMI proximal LAD occlusion s/p DES with
hemodynamics consistent with moderately elevated filling
pressures and low cardiac index. ECHO demonstrates anterior
apical akinesis, EF 30-40%.
.
# CAD s/p STEMI: Patient presented following 1 day history of
severe chest pain (late presentation). Pt received ASA 325mg and
nitro in the field (dosage/relief uncertain). In the ED, his
SBPs dropped from 130s to 90s. Pt received 02, Plavix 600mg,
Heparin bolus, and morphine. Nitro was held for SBP less than
100. His EKG showed NSR with lateral ST elevations and
reciprocal changes. Initial troponin was 0.08 and CK: 439 MB: 10
MBI: 2.3. Pt was immediately taken to cath lab were a DES was
placed for 100% occlusion of the proximal LAD. Patient was
monitored in the Cardiac ICU intially and then transferred to
the floor. Patient with no complications following cath and
chest pain resolved. Troponin-T peaked at 9.67, CK peaked at
5378 and CK-MB 269. Patient started on Atorvastatin 80mg daily,
ASA 325mg daily, Lisinopril, and Toprol XL. Lisinopril and
Toprol were tirtrated for optimal BP and HR control, discharged
on [**Month/Day/Year 4319**] 10mg lisinopril, toprol XL 100 mg qd. Patient to follow
up with his Cardiologists in [**Country 4194**].
.
# PUMP: ECHO s/p STEMI demonstrated LVEF 30-40% and hypokinetic
apical segments. Patient started on anti-coagulation to prevent
thrombus formation. Bridged on Heparin ggt until Warfarin
therapeutic INR [**12-30**]. Patient discharged on 5 mg Coumadin qhs for
at least 3 months. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to follow INR until patient
returns to [**Country 4194**]. Patient started on B-blocker and ACE
inhibitor. Patient should have repeat ECHO in [**Country 4194**] per
cardiologist.
