Chief Complaint:
Esophageal perforation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right thoracotomy with mediastinal debridement and repair of
esophageal perforation.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 43 y/o male with a h/o esophageal stricture s/p
balloon dilatation 7 years ago doing well with no symptoms unil
1-2 months ago when he began having pain and difficulty
swallowing.  The patient presents today complaining of a piece
of steak that got caught in the middle of his chest and caused
him to have pain.  The patient vomited the piece of steak up and
had a few episodes of bloody emesis in the ED that has since now
resolved.  NG lavage was negative.  The patient currently
complains of right sided chest pain that is worse with
inspiration.  No shortness of breath or chest pain.  On CT
imaging, the patient was found to have a thickened mid esophagus
with what appears to be contained leak at the level of the
carina.  There is also what appears to be intraesophageal air as
well as a small area of pneumomediastinum adjacent to the
esophagus very concerning for esophageal perforation.  Over the
course of his hospitalization, in the emergency room, he
developed tachycardia up to 145, a temperature up to 102.5, a
white count which was initially normal at 10, and diaphoresis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Based on the constellation of findings, it was determined that
the best treatment was to take the patient to the OR for a right
thoracotomy with mediastinal debridement and repair of
esophageal perforation.  The patient tolerated the surgery well
and was transferred to the ICU intubated in order to allow the
esophagus to heal.  An NG tube was placed to decompress the
stomach.  Broad spectrum antibiotics were started empirically.
TPN was started to provide nutrition.  Initially, there was
difficulty in weaning the patient to extubate because of
agitation.  The thought was that his surgical pain from the
thoracotomy could have been contributing to this so an
intercostal nerve block was performed by the acute pain service.
 However, this was unsuccessful in stemming the agitation.  The
patient was started on a Precidex drip and finally was able to
be extubated on post-op day 4.  The patient remained stable and
was transferred to the floor.  His bowel function returned, his
NG tube was d/c'd, and he had a barium swallow and a CT scan
which did not reveal an anastomotic leak.  He was started on a
diet and was able to tolerate a soft regular diet on discharge.


On post-op day 11, the patient spiked a fever.  He was
pancultured and a chest x-ray revealed a new right middle/lower
lobe infiltrate.  Cultures had no growth.  The patient was
started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for presumed pneumonia.  He was
discharged on a 7 day course of Augmentin.  Psychiatry was
consulted to provide recommendations for managing the patient's
depression.  Physical therapy was consulted to assist the
patient with ambulation.  The patient was discharged on post-op
day 15 in good condition with pain well controlled, in good
spirits, and able to ambulate independently.
