HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Sixty-one-year-old male with
diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, status
post silent MI in [**2135**] with CABG (SVG to RCA, SVG to OM, SVG
to diagonal, LIMA to LAD, status post left main and diagonal
stents in [**2144-10-24**]), CHF with an EF of 30% underwent an
uneventful right carotid endarterectomy in [**2144-12-24**].
Went to rehab.  Patient had a presyncopal event and had
cardiac catheterization in [**Hospital1 **].  No change since his last
catheterization in [**2144-10-24**], but no left subclavian
artery stenosis at 70%.

On the day of admission, the patient came in for an elective
left carotid endarterectomy and had episodes of hypotension.
Systolic blood pressures of 80 at the time of preoperative
catheterization, and then decreased systolic blood pressure
around 65.  Patient was started on Neo-Synephrine.  EKG
showed ST depressions of 2 mm in V4 through V6, I and aVL.
Patient was persistently hypotensive off Neo and post 1 liter
of lactated ringers.  Patient was transferred to the Cardiac
Care Unit to rule out for myocardial infarction and pressure
support.  Also the patient was found to have blood glucoses
of greater than 600, and was started on an insulin drip.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is married on disability.  Used
tobacco cigarettes.  Quit at age 50.  Alcohol use rare.  No
history of drug abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus and coronary artery
disease in parents.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  84, 14, 95/43 on 2 mg of Neo-Synephrine.  No
apparent distress.  Moist mucous membranes.  Oropharynx
within normal limits.  Jugular venous pressure approximately
7 cm.  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.  Regular, normal S1,
S2, no S3, S4, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower
sternal border, orientation x3.

EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at 82, normal axis, normal
intervals, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in I, aVL, V4 through V6
compared with [**2144-12-24**].

Echocardiogram on [**1-14**] at the [**Hospital1 **]:  1+ MR, 1+ TR,
increased left atrial enlargement, PA pressure approximately
45, EF 40%, apical akinesis.  Dilated and hypertrophied left
ventricle.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 10.3,
hematocrit 32.2, platelets 277.  Sodium 135, potassium 4.4,
chloride 97, bicarb 27, BUN 63, creatinine 2.0, glucose 163.
CK 35, myoglobin fractionation 11.  Troponins were 0.07,
0.07, and 0.08.  INR 1.1.  PTT 27.  Digoxin level 1.2.

Repeat catheterization in [**2144-12-24**] showed left main stent
patent, left circumflex diffuse disease, RCA totally
occluded, SVG to RCA totally occluded, SVG to OM okay, SVG to
diagonal total occlusion, diagonal stent okay.  LIMA to LAD
patent.  70% left subclavian stenosis near LIMA.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiac:  Patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
It was felt that the patient may benefit from a stent placed
in the subclavian.  The patient went for cardiac
catheterization, and the subclavian was found to be 80%
stenosed.  A 6 mm stent was placed with 10% residual
stenosis.  There were no other complications from the cardiac
stent placement.

The patient was weaned of the Neo-Synephrine as he has had
fluid repletion from his osmotic diuresis from the  diabetes.


2. Diabetes mellitus:  The patient was initially placed on an
insulin drip, and then was converted to NPH 80 units in the
a.m., 75 units in the p.m., and a Humalog sliding scale with
the help of the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes group.

3. Infectious disease:  The patient had a UTI for which he
was treated for seven days with Levaquin.  The patient did no
go home with any oral antibiotics.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home with VNA services.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is able to get out of
bed with assistance.  He is able to feed himself and
tolerating food without difficulty.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
2. Atorvastatin 10 mg q.d.
3. Protonix 40 mg q.d.
4. Gabapentin 100 mg b.i.d.
5. Iron sulfate 325 mg q.d.
6. Multivitamin q.d.
7. Epo 40,000 units q week.
8. Docusate sodium 100 mg b.i.d.
9. Folic acid 1 mg q.d.
10. Methotrexate 2.5 mg q Tuesday.
11. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
12. Plavix 75 mg q.d. for which he will take it for nine
months.
13. Senna q.h.s.
14. Carvedilol 3.125 mg b.i.d.
15. Acetaminophen as needed for pain.
16. Valsartan 40 mg q.d.
17. NPH 80 units in the a.m. and 75 units in the p.m.
18. Humalog sliding scale, which was attached on a separate
sheet as suggested by the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes group.

FOLLOWUP:  Patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the
Outpatient Clinic in three weeks by calling [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2394**] to
