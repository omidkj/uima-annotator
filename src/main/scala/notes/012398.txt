Admission Date:  [**2158-9-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-9-6**]


Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

Allergies:
Ibuprofen / Altace

Attending:[**Location (un) 1279**]
Chief Complaint:
recurrent VT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Electrophysiological Mapping and Ventricular Tachycardia
Ablation.


History of Present Illness:
83 year old male with past medical history significant for CAD
status post  anteroseptal MI + multiple angioplasties, ischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF20-25%), and AICD (revised St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] [**2157**]).
From [**8-13**] - [**2158-8-16**] he was hospitalized for presyncope,
weakness, and hyponatremia (long standing); he was discharged to
rehab and returned home on [**2158-8-30**] where on [**2158-8-31**] he again
experienced presyncope, feeling lightheaded, fell (without loss
of consciousness), and went to [**Hospital6 33**].  There he
experienced multiple shocks by his AICD.  Initial interrogation
revealed frequent recurrent VT that were hemodynamically
tolerated.  Despite reprogramming and magnet placement he still
experienced shocks and was ultimately started on amiodarone with
prompt suppression of the recurrent VT.  He was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].  Here the [**Hospital3 9642**] device was again
interrogated/reprogramed and amiodarone continued.  The patient
remained VT free and EP was consulted.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Cardiovascular:  With respect to PUMP, the patient's ejection
fraction was 20-25% per outside hospital records.  He remained
euvolemic on exam throughout his hospital admission.  The
patient was started on toprol 25 once a day and then advanced to
toprol 75 at discharge.  A trial dose of captopril 6.25 mg was
attempted because the patient described his altace allergy as
consisting of a headache.  At discharge, the patient's blood
pressure tolerated a dose of 12.5 mg and he did not complain of
any headache, lightheadedness, or cough.  This was increased to
10 mg lisinopril at discharge.  He was instructed to follow up
on this dose of ACE inhibitor at his next PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 648**].  With
respect to RHYTHM, the patient reverted to normal sinus rhythm
with occasional bouts of ventricular tachycardia while on
amiodarone.  EP was consulted and it was felt that the patient
was an ablation candidate.  He was subsequently discontinued
from his amiodarone before the procedure and demonstrated
several more episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
On [**9-4**], the patient successfully underwent ablation therapy
without complication.  There was one limited episode of five
beats of ventricular tachycardia the following evening.  With
respect to ISCHEMIA, the patient has known CAD but did not
experience any chest pain or demonstrate EKG changes during his
hospital course.  His outpatient dose of toprol was increased to
50 mg, and has continued on lovastatin 20 mg and aspirin 325 mg.


2) HTN: The patient's hypertension improved with addition of an
ACE inhibitor, especially as it was titrated upward near
discharge.  It was not felt necessary to increase his
beta-blocker, but it insofar as his heart rate allows, perhaps
this should be considered in the future.

3) URINARY RETENTION: The patient is status post TURP nearly 10
years ago.  Urinalysis revealed a urinary tract infection and
culture grew out 10-100K Pseudomonas resistant to levofloxacin.
Piperacillin was temporarily started per ID, but due to lack of
white cells on the urinalysis, it was subsequently felt this was
a long term colonization issue rather than an acute infection
with the risk of bacteremia.

4) FEN: The patient was maintained on a cardiac healthy, low
sodium diet.  Potassium was kept greater than 4 and Magnesium
was kept greater than 2.

5) RIGHT TOE PARONYCHIA: Patient was instructed to follow up
with outpatient podiatry.  He was given 500 mg keflex for a 10
day course in the meantime because the patient complained of
pain.

6) PHYSICAL THERAPY: Due to the patient's multiple recent
hospitalizations, physical therapy was consulted.  Their
evaluation was that the patient required short term
rehabilitation due to hospital aquired deconditioning.  The
patient's wife was informed of this and agreed with the
management decision to send the patient to rehab.
