Service:  VASCULAR SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 83-year-old patient resides
at a rehab center with a past medical history of insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease,
multiple falls, chronic depression, chronic atrial
fibrillation, and hypertension.  The patient had developed
pressure ulcers to the left heel and calf which escalated to
gangrene.  The patient also has ulcerations to the right
heel.

He was brought to [**Hospital1 69**] for
angiogram studies of his lower extremities.  Intraoperatively
found that both right and left femoral arteries were occluded
and multiple inflation stent placements and removal was done
with total of 10,000 units of Heparin given.  The studies
were significant for severe peripheral vein disease on the
right, but more so to the left.  Patient was recanalized with
left CIA, external iliac artery, and CFA with mechanical
thrombectomy.

Postangiogram, the patient was transferred to the MICU for
observation due to Heparin GTT for anticoagulation and strict
control of blood pressure.  On admission to the TSICU, the
patient was status post angiogram and bilateral external
iliac stents with thrombectomy requiring Intensive Care Unit
care secondary to close blood pressure monitoring, strict
control requiring the nitroglycerin.  Diastolic blood
pressures went as high as 120 postoperatively.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Neurologically, the patient was
a pleasant and confused at times and was able to follow
simple commands, slow mentation needing repeated questioning
at times.  Patient denied seizure activity, and was able to
move upper extremities without difficulty, lower extremities
were move on bed.  Cardiovascularly, the patient was in
chronic atrial fibrillation with occasional PVCs noted,
systolic blood pressure to 140s and above.

Nitroglycerin was used for blood pressure control, and
regular heart rate at 60s to 70s and palpable pulses to
bilateral radials, peripheral pulses showed dopplerable
bilateral femoral pulses, right posterior tibial dorsalis
pedis, no Doppler pulse to the left dorsalis pedis or PT.
Patient was continued on Heparin and denied chest pain.

Lungs had coarse rhonchi and crackles to the upper lobes, but
the patient does not complain of any shortness of breath at
time even during episodes of desaturation to the high 80s.
Respiratory rate never increased above 18-20 and was
unlabored.

GI:  Abdomen was round, soft, and slightly distended.  Bowel
sounds x4 quadrants.  The patient was able to tolerate po's
with observation and monitoring.  No complaints of nausea,
vomiting, or diarrhea.

Genitourinary:  There is an indwelling Foley catheter secure
and patent with adequate, but minimal output.  The patient
had elevated BUN and creatinine at time of admission to
50/1.8.

Integument:  There was no signs of breakdown noted to the
back or buttocks.  Gangrenous toes noted to bilateral feet,
large black, necrotic ulcers to bilateral heels and to left
calf.  The patient was very sensitive to these areas needing
repositioning for comfort and to minimize friction to the
areas.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION TO THE SICU:  Generally, a
temperature of 36.9, blood pressure 118/47, heart rate of 81,
and O2 saturation of 98% on room air, respiratory rate of 16.
Generally, alert, awake, oriented male.  HEENT:  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements are intact.  Cardiovascularly,
irregularly, irregular.  Respiratory is clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft and nontender.  Extremities
showed 1+ palpable femoral pulses, dopplerable right PT and
dorsalis pedis and nondopplerable left.  Two second capillary
refill on the right lower extremity, [**2-22**] second capillary
refill to the left lower extremity without groin hematomas.
Neurologically:  There were no focal deficits.  Mentation was
still slow.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION TO THE SICU POSTANGIOGRAM:  White
count of 17, hematocrit of 31.2, platelets of 530 with PT,
PTT, and INR of 14.6, 34.2, and 1.4.  Chemistries of 129,
5.3, 98, 17, 50, and 1.8.

In the SICU, the patient was weaned on his nitroglycerin
drip.  Was started on Norvasc and Diovan.  Goal systolic
blood pressure less than 150 with Doppler pulse examinations
followed closely.

On postintervention day two, laboratories showed increased
creatinine to 2.4 and Renal team became involved.  They they
discontinued the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], Norvasc, and allowed the
blood pressure to increase to 140-60 range with Lasix prn
indicated for volume overload and hypoxia.  The patient was
fluid restricted 1 liter a day for hyponatremia and volume
overload.  Patient's IV fluids were discontinued and no ACEs,
ARBs, or NSAIDs were placed.  The urine was checked for
protein-to-creatinine ratio.  Antibiotics dosed appropriately
for renal.

Postangio day three, the patient is continued without
incident and Renal input was noted and in place.  Patient's
creatinine then went to 3.0 and stabilized at 3.0 for one day
following Renal's input, and then rose to 3.6.

On hospital day seven, a right IJ was placed with good
position, and urine output was 30 cc an hour with Lasix,
creatinine at 4.0 with 3+ bilateral femoral pulses, and
Coumadin started 5 mg with a goal INR of 1.8 to 2.0.  Patient
was made out of bed at this time and transferred to the
floor.

On postprocedure day seven, patient was continued to be
followed by Renal with continued increase in creatinine and
recommendations were to continued the MAP greater than 70,
systolic blood pressure greater than 120, hematocrit greater
than 30 with assessment for no urgent need for hemodialysis.

However, patient on hospital day eight, was assessed to need
left above the knee amputation for increasing infection
gangrene.  Family was spoken to about this and seemed to need
more time to think about it.  We will continue to follow and
continued expected management for hemodialysis needs.

Patient on the [**7-18**] was found to have acute tubular
necrosis by Renal, and on examination showed generalized
edema with weakly dopplerable pulses and desperate need of
left AKA.  Levofloxacin and Flagyl were continued on
postprocedure day 11, and IV fluids again were discontinued.
Lasix 40 mg IV bid started to try to diurese patient.
Patient then underwent left above the knee amputation on
[**2185-6-21**], hospital day 13 without incident.

The patient was then transferred back to the floor, and on
postoperative day #1, showed stump intact with decreasing
edema.  Renal fellow noted on postoperative day one that
family did not want patient to be on dialysis.

Postoperative day one, the patient was made comfort measures
only, and at 14:45 on [**2185-6-22**], the patient was found
unresponsive in his bed.  The patient had acute renal failure
on chronic renal disease with congestive heart failure and
went into respiratory arrest.

TIME OF DEATH: 14:45.

DIAGNOSES:
1. Peripheral vascular disease.
2. Insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
3. Acute renal failure.
4. Atrial fibrillation.
5. Coronary artery disease.
6. Hypertension.
7. Chronic renal insufficiency.
8. Depression.
