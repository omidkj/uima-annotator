Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was evaluated in the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2139-3-31**]. He
was intubated. NGT and central line were placed. WBC count was
21.3; Hct 37.3; Creatinine 1.5; lactate 4.6; LFTs WNL. (+)UTI.
Abdominal/Pelvic CT scan showed extensive portal venous gas,
with diffuse colonic wall thickening and pericolonic stranding
consistent with pancolitis. He was admitted to the ICU under the
care of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**]. Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl were started. He responded
to fluid resuscitation with improved urine output and stable
vital signs. After a long discussion with the family it was
decided that he would not receive surgical intervention, but
would receive maximal medical therapy.  AT HD 1 WBC count was
still elevated at 19; lactate 2.3.  He was hemodynamically
stable with UOP WNL.  He remained intubated/sedated. At HD 3 he
was extubated. WBC count remained elevated at 24.9. Acidosis was
resolving. TPN was started. At HD 5 he was transferred to the
floor. C. difficile was negative x 2. Blood and urine cultures
were negative from admission. At HD 7 he was afebrile and
continued on IV Abx. WBC count was 21.8.  Abdominal/Pelvic CT
scan showed portal vein thrombosis, slightly improved colonic
thickening, and bilateral pleural effusions. Anticoagulation was
started. Pt's clinical status remained stable.  His wbc count
remained elevated, although he remained a-febrile and was
tolerating clear liquid diet.  HD 10, his abdomen was noted to
be more distended and a KUB revealed a gastric dilatation.  He
was made NPO and continued on TPN.  On HD12, he was noted to
have desaturation down to the 70%, hypotension, and questionable
seizure activity.  He was noted to be retaining CO2 with a PaCO2
measured at 100.  He was intubated and transferred to the ICU.
In the ICU, he required aggressive fluid rescusitation,
ventilatory support and occasional pressor support.  He
underwent bilateral thoracentesis in an effort to improve
pulmonary status, but still remained vent dependent.
Maintainance of his blood pressure required aggressive fluid
rescuscitation with pressor support.  His kidney function
declined as evidenced with a rising serum creatinine.  The
patient's LFT's and coagulation profile also suggested liver
decomponsation.  A family meeting was held on HD 16 to discuss
his clinical status and the fact that he was not improving,
still requiring aggressive support, and the family reiterated
their decision for him NOT to undergo any surgical intervention.
 It was decided that he would be supported until his sister
could come to the hospital on HD 17 to say goodbye.  His sputum
cultures eventually grew Klebsiella.  The patient was made very
comfortable, his ventilator support was withdrawn on the morning
of HD 18, and he expired shortly thereafter.  The family
declined an autopsy for religious reasons.
