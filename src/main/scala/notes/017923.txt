Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
69 year old man with COPD (on 2L NC at home; FEV1 1.12 at
baseline), central hypoventilation, sleep disordered breathing
on home BiPAP, obesity, CAD s/p MI and LAD stent, h/o recurrent
Vfib/Vtach s/p AICD placement, presents from pulmonary clinic
with dyspnea and hypoxia.  He reports that since a
hospitalization in [**State 108**] in late [**Month (only) 547**] for COPD exacerbation,
although improved, his breating has never subjectively felt back
to his previous baseline although his oxygen sats were at his
baseline low 90s% on 2-3L NC.  Over the past few weeks however,
he has noted worsening LE edema and increasing DOE so that even
walking across the room from the bathroom made him feel SOB.  He
reports discomfort in B/L LEs with the edema, but not marked
pain nor asymmetry.  He reports he drove from [**State 108**] to Mass.
in 10 hour stretches approximately 2 weeks ago.  He reported his
worsening LE edema and SOB to his cardiologist who increased his
lasix dose from 40mg PO daily to 80mg PO daily for the 4 days
prior to his admission.  He reports he has been making "good"
urine to this and his LE edema has improved, however his SOB has
not.  He denies increased sputum production nor fevers/chills.
so held on seeking medical attention until this previously
scheduled appointment.  At pulmonary clinic, he was noted to be
hypoxic to 82% on 2-3L NC.  A CT chest was performed which
showed bilateral ground glass opacities.  Following imaging and
in the setting of his worsened hypoxia, he was referred to the
medical floor for direct admission.
.
With respect to his late [**Month (only) 547**] admission for hypoxia.  He
reports he developed worsening hypoxia at home and presented to
a local hospital in [**State 108**].  He endorses worsening in his
sputum production at that time.  He was treated for COPD
exacerbation with 10 day course of levofloxacin and 30 day slow
taper of prednisone.  Although he reports improvement from that
hospitalization, he never returned to baseline and over the past
2 weeks has further decompensated as outlined above.
.
Upon direct admission to the floor, initial O2 sats were noted
to be in the 70s, he was placed on additional supplemental O2
(unclear exact amount via NC) and initial ABG revealed
7.28/75/72.  He was then placed on bipap after which repeat gas
was 7.28/76/51.  From there he was changed to cpap although ABG
on cpap was not obtained.  He received 100mg IV lasix x1 to
which he put out 450ccs urine.  Upon transfer to the ICU, he was
on 4L NC with O2 sats high 80s to low 90s.  Repeat ABG at that
time was 7.30/77/57.  He has made an additional 220 ccs urine
for a total of 670cc out since lasix dosing.
.
ROS:  No changes in vision, no headache.  No
numbness/tingling/weakness.  No chest pain/palpitations.  No
abdominal pain, no frank blood in stool (but endorses guaiac
positive at recent PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]), no dark tarry stools.  No
dysuria/hematuria.  No rashes.  +joint pain specifically low
back.

Pertinent Results:
[**2134-6-7**] CT chest:  Newly occurred diffuse, inhomogeneous, and
slightly apical predominant pattern of parenchymal opacities
that suggests either RB-ILD or DIP. Early NSIP is less likely
given the distribution of the changes.
.
[**2134-6-7**] TTE:  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION:  Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic valve stenosis. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension (50 mmHg).
.
[**2134-6-9**] Bubble study:  Right to left intracardiac shunting is
present at rest. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot
be quantified.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-6-7**],
right to left intra-cardiac shunting is present at rest. If
clinically indicated, a TEE may clarify the degree of
intracardiac shunting and to clarify PFO versus ASD.

Brief Hospital Course:
69yo M with h/o COPD (2-3L home O2 requirement), CAD, CHF, v.
fib/v. tach arrest s/p AICD presents with subacute worsening of
dyspnea and hypoxemia and hypercarbia.
.
# Hypoxemia/Hypercarbia:  Multifactorial in the setting of known
COPD with mixed obstructive/restrictive pattern on PFTs.  He was
not, however, markedly bronchospastic on exam and denies
increased sputum production to suggest overt COPD exacerbation.
Also without focal infiltrate, leukocytosis and fever to suggest
underlying lobar pneumonia although atypical infection was
possible, but less likely.  Further review of ground glass
opacities on chest CT suggested that this was actually the
result of poor inspiratory effort more than fluid buildup or
atypical pneumonia. His BNP was 838 (although may be somewhat
lower than expected given obesity) and thus not overwhelming for
CHF. On TTE he had pulmonary htn (50 mmHg) when compared to
prior which may also be contributing.

In terms of risk for PE, he had long drives from [**State 108**] and
thus perhaps a significant risk, but a lung scan was done and
suggested low probability for PE. Additionally TTE without
decline in EF (actually better than previously) to suggest acute
ischemic eve
