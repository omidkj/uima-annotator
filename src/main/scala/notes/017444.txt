not receive any thrombolytics. Treated with heparin gtt for 48
hours, ASA, metoprolol, and simvastatin. Troponin peaked at
39.54. Echo showed EF of 30% with anterior wall akinesis,
several septal hypokinesis, apical hypokinesis, and mid-inferior
wall moderate hypokinesis; no valvular abnormality. Lisinopril
was continued. Diltiazem was switched to metoprolol. Clopidogrel
