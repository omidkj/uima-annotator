History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68M with DM and Asthma/COPD who presents with
respiratory arrest. Per his wife, he developed non-productive
cough yesterday with increasing wheezing and chest tightness. No
GI or GU symtpoms. No sick contacts or travel, no fever chills
sweats. He took duonebs and prednisone 40mg last night. Today
patient was in the bathroom, wife left a few minutes to go
downstairs. When she returns minutes later, she found him
cyanotic. He was initially awake but then lost consciousness.
His wife attempted to feel for a pulse but didn't detect one.
She initiated CPR.
.
Per OSH records, patient got epinephrine, atropine, and
peripheral dopamine. ?Use of pacer. Took ~10-12 minutes before
pulse returned. Intubated in the field. Sent to an OSH, found to
be in sinus tachycardia in 110's sats in low 90's on 100%. ABG
there 7.17/64/90 on 100% O2. Got combivent, levaquin, solumedrol
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, vitals were 97 100 130/70 on dopamine 95-96% bagged.
CTA chest with multifocal pneumonia without PE. Got vancomycin
and zosyn. CT head worrisome for anoxic brain injury. No
surgical intervention per neurosurgery. Lactate was 3.7 at
presentation. Initial ABG here 7.04 104 204 31. Changed to
levophed. K of 7 -> got sodium bicarb, insulin.
.
Most recent vitals in ED afebrile P60 104/55 20 92-93%. On
levophed at 0.2.

Pertinent Results:
Micro [**2112-11-18**] 2/2 blood cx pending
.
EKG SR @97, right axis, J point elevation V1-V2 with peaked T's
in V2-V3, STD with TWI in II,III,vF with small q's.
.
Imaging
CXR
Multifocal consolidations consistent with aspiration versus
multifocal pneumonia.
.
CTA chest
PFI: No evidence of PE. Severe multi-focal pneumonia, with
[**Male First Name (un) 239**]-in-tree
appearance. Multiple small lung nodules. Recommend repeat CT
chest after medical treatment of pneumonia in order to rule out
malignancy. Severe coronary disease. Severe spine deformity.
.
CT head
diffuse hypodensity of the cerebellum with mass effect on the
fourth ventricle and braintem is concerning for stroke. no
hemorrhage. MRI evlaution is recommended.
.
Repeat CT head:  FINDINGS: There is new global effacement of
sulci consistent with global cerebral edema. There is new
effacement of the quadrigeminal and suprasellar cisterns
consistent with transtentorial herniation. There is new
noncommunicating hydrocephalus with symmetric dilatation of the
lateral and third ventricle with effacement of the fourth
ventricle. Concern for tonsillar herniation is present with
crowding at the foramen magnum, not well evaluated on CT given
beam hardening artifact in this region.
The patient is intubated with secretions in the nasopharynx.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage. Increased opacification
of the sphenoid sinuses likely relate to intubation. Improvement
of air-fluid levels within the maxillary sinus is noted.
  Numerous superficial scalp electrodes incidentally noted.
  IMPRESSION:
1. New global cerebral edema with new effacement of the
suprasellar and
quadrigeminal cisterns consistent with component of herniation.
2. New noncommunicating hydrocephalus.
3. Crowding of the foramen magnum is concerning for tonsillar
herniation.
However, evaluation is limited given beam hardening artifact in
this region.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree with the above, except
that I am not sure that the effacement of the supratentorial
cisterns reflects herniation as much as global swelling. there
is definitely tonsilar herniation, new since the study of
[**2112-11-18**].

Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old man with DM and asthma who presented following a
cardiopulmonary arrest at home.
.
1. PEA arrest:  Secondary to hypoxia or acidosis.  The patient
remained in sinus rhythm while ventilator and pressor dependent.
 The patient underwent cooling and reheating.  The patient had
evidence of anoxic brain injury by CT scan from [**2112-11-18**] and
repeat CT of the head on [**2111-11-20**] showed evidence of tonsilar
herniation.  His neurological exam showed no brainstem function
with no gag, corneal or pupil reflex.  Neurology was consulted
and conducted EEG which showed no brain wave activity.  After an
indepth discussion with the patient's family, the decision was
made to make the patient CMO and withdraw care considering his
brain death secondary to cardiac arrest.
.
2. Hypotension:  Likely was secondary to arrest or underlying
sepsis, remained pressor dependent during course. Pt had
elevated white blood cell count on admission, however on
steroids.  [**Month (only) 116**] have had underlying pneumonia as cause of COPD
exacerbation with element of sepsis.  IJ was placed for accurate
CVP measurement
.
3. Respiratory failure:  Probably secondary to pneumonia versus
COPD exacerbation. Imaging consistent with multifocal pna.  The
patient had a recent MICU stay so nosocomial pathogens thought
to be possible cause.  Treated empirically with antibiotics
including vanc/zosyn.  Continued nebs and steroids.
.
4. DM: Started insulin drip and titered to sugars b/w 100-200,
goal fingersticks <150
.
5. HTN:  Held home antihypertensives in the setting of
hypotension.
.
6. Hyperkalemia:  peaked T's resolved on repeat EKG in ICU. Got
calcium, insulin/dextrose. Kayexalate.  Repeat K WNL.
.
7. ARF:  Trending up to 4.0, likely secondary to hypotension,
most likely ATN.  Consulted renal about possibly starting CVVH..
.
PPX heparin SQ, protonix, mouthcare, head of bed elevations

Communication wife [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96733**], son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96734**]
.
After the patient was determined to have significant anoxic
brain injury secondary to cardiac arrest, the patient was taken
off pressor and ventilatory support.  He was apneic after
extubated and passed within minutes.  The family was offered an
autopsy, but declined.
