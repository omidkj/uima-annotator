Studies-
-Portable TTE ([**2181-3-17**])
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral akinesis, as well as
lateral hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 30-35%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w extensive left circumflex-territory infarction.
Moderate to severe ischemic mitral regurgitation.

-pCXR ([**2181-3-17**])
The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged. There is hazy
perihilar opacification with indistinct pulmonary vascularity
and increased interstitial markings, consistent with
mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Very small bilateral pleural
effusions are suspected. Fissures appear thickened. Minimal
linear atelectasis is noted in the posterior right lower lobe,
but there is no definite evidence for pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Findings suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary
edema.

[**2181-3-19**] Intra-op TEE:
Conclusions
Extremely limited prebypass images were viewed as patient
arrested and CPB was emergently initiated.

POST-CPB:
The patient is on epinephrine, norepinephrine, milrinone, and
vasopressin infusions. No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of
the left atrium. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-39 %). Hypokinesis is most
notable in the mid-inferior and inferolateral segments. The
right ventricle base is mildly hypokinetic and the free wall is
moderately hypokinetic.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.

A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Echogenic material seen in the descending thoracic aorta is
consistent with IABP. There is no evidence of aortic dissection.


Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of study.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old Female presented to ER on [**2181-3-17**] with Nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea
times one week. Lasix was stopped due to gastrointestinal
symptoms and now she then had Dyspnea on exertion. On arrival to
ER Troponins 1.62-2.31. EKG w/ Infer/Lat changes. BNP 20,000.
She had been pain free on heparin drip and was taken to the cath
lab on [**2181-3-19**]. Prelim report found to have occluded circumflex
and small RCA with normal LAD. Ms.[**Known lastname **] became unstable while in
the cath lab and an IABP was placed. Cardiac surgery was called
to eval for emergent surgery. She required emergent intubation
in the cath lab secondary to respiratory distress. She
subsequently developed asystole, rec'd CPR and a transvenous
pacer placed. She was shocked for VF, required pressor support
for blood pressure and taken emergently to the operating room
with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. She underwent emergent coronary bypass grafting x4
with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
artery and reverse saphenous vein grafts to the distal right
coronary artery, first obtuse marginal artery and first diagonal
artery/ Mitral valve repair with a 26-mm [**Company 1543**] CG feature
and annuloplasty ring, model #638R.CROSS-CLAMP TIME:107
minutes.PUMP TIME:  174 minutes. The pericardium was
reapproximated around the internal mammary artery and around the
aorta.  The patient was oxygenating marginally,and given her
tenuous status, Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] left her with an open chest, sedated and
paralyzed. Due to her hypoxia, postoperatively she was bronched
with clearing of secretions, after which her oxygenation
improved. She received a few doses of lasix, and with minimal
response,she was given a bolus of 120 mg iv along with 500 mg iv
chlorothiazide, started on lasix drip, and renal was consulted.
POD#2 she underwent a mediastinal washout with clot removal. The
IABP was discontinued. She remained volume overloaded and
oliguic. Renal recommended that CVVH for volume removal be
started. Attempts to wean off inotropy and pressor support was
slow. [**2181-3-23**] Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken back to the OR for sternal
closure. Please see operative report for further details.
Over the next few days pressors were weaned, and volume was
removed via CVVH. Nutrition was initiated via TPN and ultimately
tube feeds. Her neuro status was intact, with some minor
weakness of her right upper extremity. An US of her right upper
extremity was negative for DVT. A LUQ US was done on [**3-25**]
secondary to an elevated TBili. There were no findings to
suggest acute cholecystitis; no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary
ductal dilatation. She was placed on Heparin drip for a
progressive right t
