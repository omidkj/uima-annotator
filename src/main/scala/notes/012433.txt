History of Present Illness:
82 y/o Portuguese speaking F with PMH of severe COPD with h/o
respiratory failure [**2-27**] with pseudomonas VAP, VRE bacteremia,
CMV viremia requiring trach/PEG that were subsequently removed,
ESRD on HD who presented from OSH [**1-19**] with hypotension, SBP 80s
and low grade temp. She had been doing well until a recent COPD
flare that led to an admission at [**Hospital3 **]. She was discharged
to a rehab facility on [**1-17**] on 60 of prednisone for a taper. She
had been complaining of some weakness since that discharge. On
presentation for HD ([**1-19**], day of admission), she was reported
to have SBPs in the 70s-80s, and was sent to the ED. At the OSH
ED, she had a rectal temp of 100.2. She had a CXR showing
bilateral infiltrates. She was given vanco, ceftriaxone and
levofloxacin. She had a R femoral CVL placed and was started on
levophed when her pressures were as low as systolics in the 60s.
 She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU at that time.

[**1-21**], [**1-22**], [**1-23**]
Blood Culture, Routine (Pending): NGTD

RADIOLOGY:
CXR:
FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Patchy
right
mid-to-lower lung opacity is worrisome for pneumonia. Perihilar
and
interstitial opacities raise concern for pulmonary edema. No
large pleural
effusions are seen, however, trace effusions would be difficult
to exclude.
The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.

TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen (adequate-quality study). Normal
global and regional biventricular systolic function.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo F with h/o COPD, ESRD on HD MWF, afib, CAD s/p MI and PCI,
and hypothyroidism who was transfered to the MICU from an OSH
for hypotension requiring pressors due to pneumonia and MRSA
bacteremia.
.
#) Pneumonia
On presentation for HD, she was reported to be hypotensive and
sent to an OSH ED. She had a CXR showing bilateral infiltrates.
She was given vanco, ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. She had a R
femoral CVL placed and was started on levophed and transferred
to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on arrival, her initial vitals were 96.4 102
108/49 22 97% 4L NC. She had a repeat CXR confirming the
pneumonia findings. Pt was begun on vanc/cefepime/azithro on
admission.  Repeat CXR confirmed multifocal pneumonia.  She was
successfully weaned from levophed over HOD1 and the pt continued
to hold her BPs (91-153/34-62) at HR of 96-110 (aFib).  Due to
marked clinical improvement, the patient's femoral CVL was
removed and she was transferred to the general medicine floor on
HOD2.  She continued to improve, and was weaned from
supplemental oxygen on HOD4.  No successful sputum culture was
ever obtained for organism identification or sensitivities.  She
was discharged to finish a 14 day course of ceftaz/azithro to
finish on [**2133-2-1**].  The PICC was removed prior to discharge due
to concerns of MRSA seeding and therefore Vancomycin treatment
was extended to 14 days from d/c femoral CVL (last day of
Vancomycin [**2-3**])  The azithro was switched to PO, and the
vanc/ceftaz was planned to be administered at hemodialysis.
-- Ceftazidime 1g QHD for 14 days (last day: [**2-1**])
-- Azithromycin 250mg q24 for 14 days (last day: [**2-1**])
-- Vancomycin 1g QHD for 14 days (last day [**2-3**])
-- please wean O2 as tolerated
-- O2 sat difficult to read on fingers and more accurate
readings obtained on forehead.
.
#) MRSA bacteremia
Initial blood culture in the ED grew MRSA.  Unclear whether the
bacteremia was secondary to the pneumonia, or was related to the
femoral CVL placement, or from hemodialysis.  She was already on
vancomycin emperically.  All subsequent blood cultures are
pending, and are NGTD. An TTE was performed and negative for
endocarditis.
