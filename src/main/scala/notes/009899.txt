History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 68 yo nursing home resident with pmhx COPD,
bipolar, L CVA, HTN, chronically trached with pegged who was
brought to the ER for fever, increased respiratory rate and
tacchycardia as well as altered mental status. Patient was
intubated and sedated. His rehab center is [**Hospital3 672**]
Hospital in [**Location (un) 86**] which was contact[**Name (NI) **] in the middle of the
night for additional information. Floor staff could not give
clear history of events of yesterday as the staff who sent him
to [**Hospital1 18**] had left for the day. In the ED, initial vs were: T 104
rectally, BP 60/p, HR 130, R 30, sat 100% on vent. Patient's
initial labs showed white count 23, bun 80, creatinine 4.2
(baseline 1.1 in [**Month (only) **], K 6.2 which trended up to 7.2, lactate
4.1-->2.7, troponin 0.22 with CK 1050 MB 6. Of note, patient
recently had UTI, but UA on this admission showed [**3-18**] wbc and
few bacteria. In the ED, patient recieved 1 g ceftriaxone, 750
IV levaquin, 1 g vancomycin, levophed gtt for presumed septic
shock and insulin, bicarb, D50, calcium gluconate for
hyperkalemia. EKG did not show peaked t waves, but rate was
130-150s, LAD, LVH, St dep I, AVL, II, V4-6. Of note, patient
was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for melena with negative EGD and
presumed LGIB but cscope was deferred and his ASA was stopped.

   On presentation to the ICU, patient was hypotensive to 60s
systolic with HR 130s. He was on levophed gtt and neo was added
for brief time as well as IVF wide open until cvp reached 14 and
then fluids were stopped. A-line was placed and by then pressure
was up to 110s systolic and neo was off.

FOUND.

      NO OVA AND PARASITES SEEN.
      This test does not reliably detect Cryptosporidium,
Cyclospora or
      Microsporidium. While most cases of Giardia are detected
by routine
      O+P, the Giardia antigen test may enhance detection when
organisms
      are rare.

           (Reference Range-Negative).
         A positive result in a recently treated patient is of
uncertain
         significance unless the patient is currently

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 68 yo man with pmhx COPD, left foot osteomyelitis, left
CVA, HTN, bipolar disorder, recent UTI and LGIB who presents
with hypotension, tacchycardia, alt ms and resp distress.
.
# Hypotension- likely secondary to septic shock given fever and
elevated white count with most likely source being lung with ?
LLL infiltrate on cxr, thick, malodorous sputum.  Loads of GI
contents suctioned from Lungs, large amount of GI content in
stomach @ time of presentatio (about 1L removed via G-tube).
Very suspicious for aspiration as cause of sepsis, or at least
aspiration secondary to sepsis.
-Patient initially on Pressors, recieving multiple liters of
fluid via CVL, early goal-directed therapy.  Patient able to
wean from Pressors within first 24hr of hospitalization.
-f/u bld, urine, sputum, picc line cx---> sputum = OP flora, no
other positive cultures.  Checked prior micro results for
sensitivities.
-pulled picc line that he came in wit
