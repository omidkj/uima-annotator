Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Persistent RLL obstruction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubatation
Arterial Line placed
IJ line placed at OSH removed
PICC line placed
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 15036**] is a 63 year-old woman with a history of sarcoidosis
who presents on transfer for evaluation of persistent
cough/fever and RLL obstruction.
.
Per the husband and daughter, approximately three months prior
to transfer, the patient was eating a chocolate bar with almonds
when she apparently aspirated an almond with a subsequent
coughing fit.  Over the next few weeks she continued to have
coughing spells without improvement.
.
Seen in pulmonology clinic in [**2200-10-8**] and started on
antibiotics, inhalers, prednisone.  PFTs showed FVC 66%, FEV1
60%, FEV/FVC 76% predicted with no change with bronchodilators.
TLC was 98% predicted though DLCO was 52% predicted.
.
Symptoms initially improved with steroids though RLL infiltrate
persisted.  Bronchoscopy was done on [**2200-12-26**] and showed
segmental material partially obstructing the posterior segment
of the RLL with marked friability and edema.  Biopsy showed
chronic inflammation with focal acute inflammation superimposed.
 Immunostains showed crushed material positive for CD-45 and
negative for pancytokeratin.
.
Admitted to OSH on [**12-30**] with fevers/cough.  CT showed RLL
consolidation with stenotic areas.  She was treated with
antibiotics and discharged home after 5-6 days.
.
Seen in pulm follow-up and underwent rigid bronchoscopy ([**2201-1-27**])
with removal of foreign body/vegetable material along opening of
stenotic bronchis of RLL.  Per the family, the patient continued
to have symptoms of cough and fevers in the days after the
procedure.
.
Readmitted to OSH on [**2-5**] with fever, malaise and SOB.  A repeat
CT showed RLL infiltrate/atelectasis.  She was continued on
steroids and started on zosyn and BiPAP (18/5).  Course was
complicated by episodes of tachypnea to 40s.  Also complicated
by troponin of 2.69 for which cardiology was consulted; they
recommended beta-blocker, aspirin and heparin gtt.  Subsequent
echo showed EF of 30% and anterior spetal wall motion
abnormality.  Given the complexity of her care, transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] was coordinated.

Brief Hospital Course:

1. Hypoxia/Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: Dyspnea has
been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months prior with
recent bronchoscopy revealing a foreign object. IP performed a
flexible bronchoscopy which showed diffuse airway edema and
friability, small partial RLL obstructing lesion, and a black
lesion in the RUL consistent with invasive aspergillis. She was
started on voriconazole that was then stopped the following day
once Aspergillius galactomannan and B-glucan returned negative.
Endobronchial biopsies were performed which eventually showed
inflammatory changes and negative fungal stains. Steroids were
weaned and she was extubated briefly with episodes of
decompensation (?acute pulmonary edema) requiring BiPAP,
eventually requiring reintubation the following day for
progressive respiratory distress. CTA chest was negative for PE
but revealed bilateral apical and perihilar ground glass
opacities with septal thickening (edema vs. infection), RLL
opacity, bilateral pleural effusions (R>L), and densely
calcified lymph nodes suggesting prior granulomatous exposure.
On [**2201-2-12**], a thoracentesis was performed with the fluid
consistent with transudate. She was started on lasix IV
diuresis. On [**2201-2-14**] the patient was extubated and the following
day transferred to the general medical floor.
  She was continued on vancomycin and zosyn for multi-lobar
pneumonia to complete a two week course (she completed zosyn
prior to discharge). Her respiratory distress, while likely
multifactorial, may have been more related to volume overload
than pneumonitis. She was continued on oral lasix for several
days and continued to require less supplemental oxygen. She was
transitioned to prednisone and tapered. Bactrim was added to her
regimen to cover PCP while on steroids. She was cleared by
speech and swallow and restarted on a regular diet. The
pulmonary service felt she will need follow-up imaging within a
month and possibly another bronchoscopy, for further evaluation
into her underlying lung process. She has a scheduled pulmonary
appointment at [**Hospital1 18**].

2. Troponin leak: The patient ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin
I of 2.69. ECG showed antero-lateral changes but no
ST-elevations. In the ICU, an echocardiogram was performed which
revealed a normal EF. CT surgery was also consulted but did not
feel further intervention was necessary at this time. Cardiology
was consulted, who thought the initial EF estimate was due to
poor echo windows and the NSTEMI due to demand ischemia from
intercurrent illness. It was felt that the patient would benefit
from a cardiac catheterization to evaluate the coronary
arteries. At the time she was continued on aspirin, statin. Beta
blocker was held given her tenuous respiratory status and
wheezing. Once stable and out of the ICU the patient underwent
cardiac cath which showed normal coronary arteries, PA pressure
42/13/25, and PCWP 12.

3. Hypertension: The patient was on max dose of ramipril at
home. In the acute setting she was hypertensive in the ICU,
which was treated with labetalol and enalapril. Once under
better control, she was slowly transitioned back to her home
dose of ramipril. She is currently on lasix mainly for her
pulmonary edema (which has largely resolved) and peripheral
edema. This can be discontinued if her blood pressure is
well-controlled on ramipril.

4. Diabetes: Blood sugars were maintained with RISS, and
glargine. Adjustments were made as she was tapered off steroids.
This may need further adjustment as an outpatient once she has
completed her taper.

7. Metabolic alkalosis: the patient was actively diuresed in the
ICU which may have exacerbated an underlying metabolic
alkalosis. She was continued on lasix po bid and electrolytes
were monitored.

8. Chronic pain: the patient was treated with percocet q4h prn
initially but required intermittent IV morphine 2-4mg for
breakthrough pain.

9. Follow-up: patient will need her foley removed when
comfortable to ambulate or use commode. Please review her
medications and discontinue any unneccessary medications (ie.
prednisone once taper complete, insulin sliding scale, lasix,
etc.).
