syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 55 year old male with h/o HCV and alcoholic cirrhosis
with esophageal varices, HCC with cardiac metastasis s/p
resection in [**2-/2189**] who now presents with syncope. Pt initially
presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital after syncopal episode last night
after a little bit of alcohol and coughing fits. There, pt was
found to have bilateral PEs that appear old (s/p
anticoagulation, stopped several months ago) and a 2.5 cm
circumferential pericardial effusion on CT. Pt had low blood
pressure at OSH but responded to fluids. Heparin was not
started, given h/o liver disease and malignancy. Of note, PET CT
in [**12/2189**] showed recurrence of RA mass.  Pt was hemodynamically
stable and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
treatment.
.
In our ED, initial VS were T 98.5 HR 64 BP 114/68 RR 18 O2 sat
95%.  An EKG showed NSR 73, low voltage, no ST changes.  Labs
were remarkable for normal WBC, plts for 67, Hct 34.  Chem was
wnl, INR 1.6. UA was neg.  A bedside US showed a large
pericardial effusion with RV bowing without tamponade physiology
and pulsus paradoxus measured 14.  CXR showed a moderate
pericardial effusion and metastatic pulmonary nodules.  TTE
showed a large right atrial mass extending into the right
ventricle and a large circumferential pericardial effusion with
brief right ventricular diastolic collapse. Cards was consulted
who suggested need of pericardial window, no need for emergent
pericardiocentesis.  Cardiac surgery was then consulted who
recommended thoracic surgery consult, given likely malignant
effusion.  Thoracic surgery was consulted who stated that they
will see once pt is admitted.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, pt is lying comfortably in bed.  States
breathing feels fine.  Complains of intermittent coughing fits.
Endorses dry cough.  Deneis fevers, chest pain, palpitations.
Of note, pt is planning a trip to [**State 108**] with son and is very
hopeful he can still make it (flight is for tomorrow).
.
On review of systems, endorses last few weeks of LE edema,
fatigue, malaise.  denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
hemoptysis. denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations.


Past Medical History:
# HCC
- has a history of hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis
complicated by grade II-III varices
- initial surveillance CT performed at an outside hospital in
[**9-/2186**] showed a 5-cm mass in the left liver as well as multiple
satellite lesions.  AFP on [**2187-11-14**] was greater than 100,000
ng/mL.
- at [**Hospital1 18**] CT on [**2187-12-6**] showed a 9 x 6 cm enhancing mass in
the left liver as well as innumerable pulmonary nodules, the
largest measuring  9-10 mm.  AFP was >600,000ng/mL.  However,
further imaging showed improved in infiltrating liver process
and
AFP decreased to 2177ng/mL on [**2188-2-25**].  No lesion was
identified
by chest CT, liver CT, U/S, or MRI for biopsy.
- He was hospitalized in [**3-/2188**] with upper GI bleed, and
echocardiogram during that hospitalization diagnosed a right
atrial mass.  HCC diagnosis was confirmed on the right atrial
mass biopsy on [**2188-4-24**].
- He began sorafenib [**2188-5-4**].  Dose was reduced after two
weeks
due to severe hand/foot syndrome and thrombocytopenia to 200mg
[**Hospital1 **].
- Mr. [**Known lastname **] self discontinued sorafenib [**2188-8-17**] due to
progressive leg cramps. His AFP had begun to rise.
- He began second line treatment with capecitabine [**2188-10-30**].
[**2189-3-13**] Exploratory laparotomy, mobilization of the
liver, mobilization inferior vena cava, inflow occlusion.
The remainder of the procedure performed by Dr. [**Known firstname **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 914**] from Cardiovascular Surgery included cardiopulmonary
bypass
and removal of the right atrial tumor thrombus.

IMAGING:
[**2190-1-26**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate pericardial effusion.
2. Metastatic pulmonary nodules.
3. Fractured superior sternal wire.
.
[**2190-1-26**] TTE: A large mass is seen in the right atrium extending
across the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle. This mass
fills the entire right atrium and it's atrial component measures
5.5x7.4 cm in maximum dimension, with bowing of the inter-atrial
septum to the left. The portion extending into the right
ventricle measures 2.8x3.7 cm in maximum dimension, and is
somewhat mobile. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?# leaflets). The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is a large circumferential pericardial
effusion measuring a maximal dimension of 2.7 cm over the right
ventricle. There is brief, diastolic collapse of the apical
right ventricular free wall. There is no respiratory variation
in trans-mitral doppler velocities.
IMPRESSION: Large right atrial mass extending into the right
ventricle. Large circumferential pericardial effusion with brief
right ventricular diastolic collapse (mass distending right
atrium and basal-mid right ventricle may prevent typical
diastolic RA/RV collapse).
.
[**2189-12-17**] PET-CT: IMPRESSION: 1. New FDG-avid disease occupying
the majority of the right atrium, extending from the upper
cavo-atrial junction to the hepato-caval venous confluence. 2.
Redemonstration of bilateral FDG-avid pulmonary nodules,
increased in size and number from the previous study.
