Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, transferred from OSH for cardiac catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2137-9-23**] Coronary artery bypass graft x 4 (Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to
diagonal, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery)

History of Present Illness:
74 year old female who presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on
[**2137-9-9**] with substernal chest pressure, hypertensive urgency,
acute kidney injury, and anemia of unclear origin (Hct 25.7 -->
29.6 with 1 unit pRBC [**2137-9-10**] reported as guaiac negative at
OSH). She noted crushing chest pressure which felt like someone
was sitting on her chest with radiation down her left arm. Pain
began on [**9-9**] around 11 am on [**9-9**] and continued until 6 pm
when she was given ASA and nitro spray by EMS. At baseline she
reports she can walk about a mile without pain or dyspnea. At
[**Hospital3 417**], her troponins were elevated to 0.66 on
[**2137-9-9**] and she was admitted to the CCU. She was noted to
have ST depressions in the anterolateral leads and was
bradycardic (most likely [**1-2**] Digoxin toxicity; level 2.4 on
admission). She underwent cardiac stress test the day of
transfer, which showed moderate sized reversible anterior
ischemia. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of
her ischemia. She was found to have coronary artery disease upon
cardiac catheterization and is now being referred to cardiac
surgery for revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2137-9-17**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION: 1. Severe LMCA and three
vessel heavily calcified coronary artery disease. 2. Systemic
systolic arterial hypertension. 3. Mild LV diastolic
dysfunction. 4. Routin post-TR band care, as ordered in POE. 5.
Cardiac surgery evaluation for suitability of CABG. 6.
Discontinue Clopidogrel. 7. Reinforce secondary preventative
measures against coronary artery disease, non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction, and diastolic dysfunction.
.
[**2137-9-17**] Carotid U/S: Bilateral heterogeneous plaque in carotid
arteries with 60-69% stenosis in the left internal carotid
artery and less than 40% stenosis in the right internal carotid
artery.
.
10/18/11Chest CT: 1. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications in the
left main, left anterior descending, and left circumflex artery.
2. Moderate atherosclerotic calcification in a non-aneurysmal
thoracic aorta. 3. Dense calcifications in the liver and spleen
suggesting prior granulomatous disease.
.
[**2137-9-23**] ECHO: PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
caclification ofnon coronary cusp. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.7 cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The posterior
leaflet has calcium on top. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before
surgical incision and especially the [**Location (un) 109**] 1.7cm2.
POST-BYPASS:
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from OSH on [**9-16**] and had plavix washout for one
week while preop w/u completed. Underwent surgery with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**9-23**] and was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition on tirated phenylephrione and propofol drips. Awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated early on POD #1.  The
patient was  hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating, yet
deconditioned, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital 91291**] and Rehab in [**Hospital1 1474**] in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions.
