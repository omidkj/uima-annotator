History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 year old man with a past medical history
significant for DM, ESRD on HD, history of Chagas disease and
CABG in [**2-15**]. The patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**]  on [**12-18**] for
scheduled peritoneal catheter placement for dialysis. However,
he was noted to be febrile and ill appearing so his procedure
was postponed and the decision was made for him to be admitted
for monitoring and further work up.

right forearm fistula on [**2126-11-28**]. However the procedure was
aborted after the vessels were found to be too small. Procedure

denies redness or swelling. He saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**2125-12-13**] but did
not undergo evaluation of the ongoing arm pain.

(Sunday) when he developed chills, subjective fever, headache,
and then nausea with vomiting. The cough was nonproductive and
the headache was not associated with nuchal rigidity or
photophobia. His appetite has been poor, but he denies any
weight loss, diarrhea or changes in his bowel movements. He also
denies dysuria, throat or ear pain. He has not had any recent
travel. + sick contacts include his wife and grandchildren who
have had nonproductive cough and rhinorhea.
.
He went to his outpt HD unit yesterday ([**2125-12-17**]) where he
reportedly was not looking well but was initially afebrile. He
spiked a low grade temp of 100.6 and was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
who ordered CBC, BMP, LFTs, CBC, and blood cultures. He was
given 1 gm Vancomycin and 80 mg Gentamycin. His catheter site
was not erythematous and had no drainiage.
.
Today he presented for the peritoneal dialysis placement but was
found to appear ill with a temp of 100.3 so the procedure was
aborted and he was admitted to medicine for further work up. VS
at time of transfer Vitals: T: 100.3 BP: 135/ HR: 60 RR:16.
