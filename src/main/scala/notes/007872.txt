Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
status epilepticus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Serial sterotactic biopsy of Right Frontal Brain Mass [**2197-8-7**]


History of Present Illness:
62 yo male w/ PMHx sig for DM II, HTN, and severe
hyperlipidemia who was found down at home.  Pt was apparently
last seen well by his friends on Saturday.  When he did not show
up
for a golfing outing with friends, they went to his house
and found him seizing behind the house on a bed of trash.  His
house was apparently condemned by the [**Location (un) **] Police due to
multiple dead animals on the property including rats and racoons
EMS was called and administered 5 mg of Valium and 10mg of
Morphine in the field. He was intubated given abnormal
respirations. FS was 190.

In the ED, the patient was found to have a temperature of 104,
HR
131s, SBP 76/59. The patient was given a total of 11 liters IVF
in the ED and his pressure rose to 103/60 on arrival to the
MICU.
He was placed on broad spectrum abx and given 10 mg IV valium,
10
mg IV Ativan and 1 gram of dilantin load in the ED for continued
L eye deviation with rhythmic jerking of the L arm and leg.  The
patient continued to have seizures in the MICU, he was given an
extra 600 mg of Phenytoin and subsequently started on a Propofol
gtt.

Routine EEG: [**2197-8-15**] Abnormal EEG due to the reduced voltage
overall, the
posterior background slowing, and the single isolated left
mid-temporal
spike discharge.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: Upon detailed analysis of the FLAIR images, comparison
with the
prior study shows slightly less extensive appearance of a
semicircular area of heterogeneously diminished FLAIR signal in
its central portion seen
along theanteromedial border of the principal tumor mass.  I am
not certain if this change relates to the biopsy procedure.
  Lastly, there is a moderate-sized air-fluid level within the
left sphenoid air cell with moderate mucosal thickening.  This
finding could relate to prior intubation or potentially be
inflammatory in origin, as fluid levels were seen on the prior
study within both sphenoid air cells on [**2197-7-22**].  There is
also prominent high T2 signal within the mastoid sinuses, which
again could relate to prior intubation or be inflammatory in
origin.

Stereotactic Biopsy and pathology results:
 With the available material, the tumor is best classified as a
DIFFUSE ASTROCYTOMA (or a diffusely infiltrating astrocytoma).
No mitotic figures are identified in the above blocks. No
necrosis or vascular proliferation is present. By WHO criteria,
the later attributes indicate the tumor is a grade 2 out of 4
astrocytoma. The available tissue lacks satisfactory pathology
that would explain the enhancement in the neuroimaging, which
suggests the enhancing areas were not sampled.

***NOTE: These immunostaining results confirm the sampled tumor
is a glioma with a low proliferative potential. The staining
features in #11 are more suggestive of a grade 2 astrocytoma
while those in #4 are more suggestive of a grade 2
oligodendroglioma. Further subclassification cannot be
confidently determined with the available material. The tumor
should be considered a grade 2 out of 4 infiltrating glioma with
low proliferative potential


Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be septic with a
temperature of 104,
blood pressure of 76/59, and was given a total of 11L IV fluids
and
broad-spectrum antibiotics.  He was also loaded with Dilantin,
given IV Ativan and Valium for continued seizures.  He had left
arm and left leg as well as left deviation throughout
examination.  He was transferred to the MICU where he was loaded
with phenobarbital and given propofol for continued evidence of
seizures. He was monitored by bedside EEG and finally
around 5:00 p.m. on [**7-20**] he stopped having electrographic
seizures.  Pt had initially required pressors for BP support in
the ICU and remained intubated for respiratory failure and
pulmonary edema.  The pressors were weaned over the first few
days in the ICU. He was monitored by EEG on [**7-22**] with showed
no evidence of any more epileptiform activity.  LP was done on
[**7-20**] that
showed three white blood cells, nine red blood cells, 74
protein,
130 glucose.  HSV-I and II were negative in the CSF.  MRI was
done on [**7-22**] and showed a right frontal lobe lesion with
small
areas of enhancement in the anterior and posterior area
suggestive of neoplasm.  CSF cultures came back negative.  The
patient was then seen by neurosurgery, planned to biopsy these
on
[**7-25**].  This was delayed as the patient had desaturated and
was found to have a PE. Weight based heparin was started for
treatment of PE and
therefore, surgery was delayed.  Pt then had recurrence of fever
while intubated and was treated with a full course of
antibiotics for presumed ventilator associated pneumonia.  The
patient had an IVC filter placed as he could not be on IV
heparin for the biopsy.  Finally, the biopsy was performed on
[**2197-8-7**].  Pathology showed a diffusely infiltrating
Astrocytoma grade 2. After diuresis and resolution of pulmonary
edema/pneumonia, the patient was extubated on [**8-9**].  The
patient has been maintained on Dilantin and phenobarbital for
seizure suppresion.  EEG on [**8-10**] showed no signs of
continued seizure.  Pt was transferred out of the ICU to regular
floor where he has done well since [**8-12**].  He has been
weaned from facetent and has been sating 99% on room air without
any continued evidence of pulm edema.  He has been stable from a
cardiovascular standpoint, with good control of BP with
Valsartan 80mg daily.  Pt passed his swallow study on [**8-14**], NG
tube was removed and he has been eating well since with no need
for supplemental nutrition.  Pt has recovered a significant
amount of neuro function, now using both his distal extremities
and more proximal extremities, however, there is still a deficit
more noticable on Left than Right.  Pt was restarted on Lovenox
sc BID for ongoing treatment of PE and was restarted on most of
his pre-admission medications.  His Metformin was not restarted
due to normal fasting blood sugars a
