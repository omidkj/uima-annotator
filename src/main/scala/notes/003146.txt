History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **]. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old man with CAD and recent STEMI on
[**2198-4-29**] who presents after telemtry at his rehab recorded a 6
second run of VT.

Mr. [**Known lastname **]. [**Known lastname **] was in his USOH until he developed excruciating
chest pain on the evening of [**2198-4-29**]. He presented to OSH where
he was found to have STEMI and underwent placement of 3mmx18mm
Xience DES to persistent 90% lesion to LAD after thrombectomy.
His hospital course was complicated by cardiogenic shock
requiring dual pressors and IABP along with VAP. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2198-5-4**]. His VAP was shown to be MSSA and
he was treated with nafcillin prior to extubation. He was
hemodynamically stable, but remained persistently febrile, so
antibiotics were expanded to vancomycin and cefepime on [**5-12**].
TTE was notable for LVEF= 20% secondary to extensive septal,
anterior, and apical akinesis and patient was started on
coumadin with heparin bridge for thrombus prophylaxis. Because
of multiple runs of NSVT noted on telemetry, patient was
provided a [**Hospital1 1516**] LiveVest and discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on
[**2198-5-16**].

At [**Hospital1 **] aside from feeling profoundly weak, he had no
complaints. He was noted to have 6 second run on polymorphic VT
at approximately 1030 am on the morning of admission. He noted
profound fatigue during this episode. The arrhythmia terminated
without shock from his LiveVest. After discussion with our EP
department, the decicions was made to admit for further
managment.

On arrival to the floor, patient is tired and anxious, but
overall feels well. He denies current CP or palpatations. He has
no SOB at rest. He reports persistent dry eyes.

Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.

IMAGING:
CXR [**5-17**]: Right IJ catheter tip is in unchanged position in the
mid-to-lower SVC.  Diffuse lung opacities have markedly worsened
in the right upper lobe.  Cardiac size is normal.  Mediastinal
lymphadenopathy is better seen in prior CT from [**5-11**].  There
is no pneumothorax.  Bilateral pleural effusions are also better
seen in prior CT, probably unchanged and small in size.  As
mentioned before, the opacities in the lungs are a combination
of pulmonary edema and multifocal pneumonia.

CXR [**5-21**]: Marked worsening of now moderate to severe pulmonary
edema which
is similar to patterns seen previously and therefore pneumonia
is felt to be unlikely.

BLE U/S [**5-18**]: Deep venous thrombosis involving left popliteal
and posterior tibial veins.

BLE U/S [**5-21**]: There is bilateral DVT involving most of the
posterior tibial and peroneal veins in both right and left lower
extremities.  No thrombus is seen more proximally from the
popliteal to the common femoral veins in either leg.

BUE U/S [**5-19**]: Complete occlusion of both cephalic veins and
partial occlusion of the right basilic vein.

BUE U/S [**5-21**]: There is bilateral cephalic vein thrombosis with
the right
cephalic vein clot extending all the way to the junction with
subclavian vein. This vein is more distended suggesting a more
acute process.  Left basilic vein thrombosis is also noted, but
none of the deep veins show evidence of thrombosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **]. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old man with coronary artery disease
(CAD) and recent admission for STEMI on [**2198-4-29**] complicated by
low ejection fraction 20% who was discharged with a LifeVest but
returned to [**Hospital1 18**] [**5-16**] after telemetry at his rehab recorded a 6
second run of ventricular fibrillation (VF). He was scheduled
for ICD placement [**5-29**]. However, prior to ICD placement, patient
developed hypotension, altered mental status and PEA arrest.
Despite agressive management including CPR and balloon pump,
patient passed away on [**2198-5-29**].

ACUTE ISSUES:

# Ventricular Tachycardia:
Patient with documented some runs of non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia (NSVT) during prior admission following STEMI on
[**4-29**].  He was sent to rehab with a lifevest for plans to return
to clinic and have repeat echo in [**3-2**] weeks to decide need for
ICD. While in the Cardiac Care Unit, he had several premature
ventricular beats which looked to originate from the same
location, so he was monitored by the EP team.  Placement of ICD
was delayed by workup of his hypercoagulable state.

# Deep vein thrombosis/Hypercoagulable State: Pt was found to
have bilateral lower extremity and bilateral upper extremity
DVTs. He was treated with hepargin gtt and IVF filter was placed
on [**5-18**], per IR. Hematology was consulted to workup possible
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. PF4 antibody was positive but
serotonin release assay negative. He was switched from heparin
gtt to argatroban gtt on [**5-22**]. Once serotonin release assay was
negative on [**5-25**], patient was switched back to heparin and
bridged to a higher dose of warfarin with goal INR 2.5-3.0.

#Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) Arrest: On the morning of
[**2198-5-29**] patient triggered for hypotension with BP in the 60s/40s.
 At this time the patient was drousy but arousable and alerted
and oriented x 3.  He was bolused 250cc x2 with no response.  He
was given high dose Levophed and Dopamine.  His BP transiently
responded to the 90s then fell to systolic 50s-60s.  The
patient's mental status then deteriorated and he became
unresponsive and a code blue was subsequently called.  Patient
was found to not have a pulse and chest compressions were
initiated.  He was found to be in Pulseless Electrical Activity.
 Multiple rounds of epinephrine and chest compressions were
performed and patient then went into pulseless VT and underwent
multiple shocks, epinephrine, amiodarone.  Patient regained a
carotid and femoral pulse transiently but then went back into
arrest.  An IABP was placed in further effort to save the
patient.  After about 1 hour of aggresive measur
