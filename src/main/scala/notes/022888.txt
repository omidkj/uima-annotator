Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted [**2141-2-22**] for surgery by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) **]. Please refer to their respective operative notes
for details of the surgery. Bilateral chest tubes, a neck JP
drain, and an NGT were placed in the OR. She was extubated in
the OR and transferred to the TICU. Pain was significant,
interfering with respiration and patient needed to be
reintubated. The morning of [**2141-2-23**] she was successfully weaned
from her ventilator and extubated. Pain was well-controlled on
IV Dilaudid. On [**2141-2-24**] chest tubes were placed to water seal,
tube feeds were started, and patient was transferred from the
TICU to the floor. On [**2141-2-26**] the left chest tube and NG tube
were removed and tube feeds were advanced to goal. On [**2-27**],
patient underwent UGI which showed no leak. She was started on
sips. She was evaluated by ENT for hoarseness and underwent
flexible endoscopy, showing normal vocal cord movement and
post-intubation swelling. The right chest tube and Foley were
removed. There was no pneumothorax on subsequent CXR. Patient
was noted to be tired, and thyroid function tests were obtained,
showing a TSH of 7.0. Levothyroxine dose was increased. On [**2-28**]
patient was started on clears. Tube feeds were subsequently
cycled. On [**3-2**] the JP drain was removed. Patient was advanced to
fulls but felt nauseated and had multiple episodes of small
amounts of emesis. After decreasing oral intake, nausea
resolved. On [**3-3**] patient was taking a full diet without nausea,
was ambulating, and received good pain control with oral
medication. She was discharged to home with services for
management of her tube feeding. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
manage thyroid supplementation titration as an outpatient.
