Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 552**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: hypercarbic resp failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Initiation of bipap
================================================================
2. TTE [**2130-7-31**]:
Read, "The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). The right atrium is moderately dilated. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Biatrial enlargement."
==============================================================
3.Chest CT w IV contrast: [**2130-8-1**]
Read, "IMPRESSION:
1. Significantly large pulmonary arteries consistent with
pulmonary
hypertension, findings that might explain the abnormality
demonstrated on the chest radiograph in the area of the left
hilum.
2. Widespread areas of consolidation as described, some of them
representing atelectasis and some of them representing
consolidation, and may be consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
The evaluation of the patient is recommended for documentation
of clearance of these findings 4-6 weeks after completion of
antibiotic therapy.
3. This study was not designed to exclude pulmonary embolism. If
clinically warranted, evaluation with dedicated study is highly
recommended.
4. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy as described, most
likely reactive, should be reassessed on the subsequent study. "
===============================================================
4. UPPER EXT CT W/O Contrast: [**2130-7-26**]
Read, "IMPRESSION:
Abnormality along the course of the median nerve, with soft
tissue density and surrounding stranding effacing the components
of the neurovascular bundle in the area of the median nerve. Due
to limitations of intrinsic soft tissue contrast on CT, the
precise extent and nature of this abnormality cannot be
evaluated -- it may extend slightly more distal or proximal and
the nerve itself is not seen as distinct from the soft tissue
density material. However, given the history, the most likely
etiology is a hematoma tracking along the neurovascular bundle.
If clinically indicated, MRI with and without contrast might
help to better delineate and characterize this finding.
Alternatively, reimaging to confirm resolution and exclude a
soft tissue mass is recommended."

History of Present Illness:
47yo woman w hx of asthma, obesity transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] w
hypercarbic resp failure.  She initially presented on [**7-11**] with
shortness of breath, DOE, increased edema x4d.  She had a pulse
of 160s on presentation.  Thought to be SVT (possibly aflutter).
 Seen by cards and started on digoxin, dilt iv, heparin gtt.
Had improved rate control but remained tachycardic.  She
underwent TEE and cardioversion on [**7-18**] which converted her to
sinus.  She was considered overloaded so was diuresed up to
36kg.  Hosp course also complicated by code blue on [**7-11**] in
setting of PICC line placement.  She became acutely hypoxic w
ABG 7.42/80/50 and improved with sitting upright.  Pt then
experienced right arm numbness which was thought [**2-4**] median
nerve injury with picc.
.
She remained hypercarbic but appeared to refuse BiPAP.  On [**7-19**]
evening following cardioversion, she became lethargic.  Given
arm numbness and apparent HA, neuro was consulted and rec head
ct which was not done [**2-4**] body habitus.  ABG showed 7.27/129/32.
 Pt was placed on BiPAP but remained hypercarbic.  Given
concerns for need for intubation and trach, pt was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].

Pt did well on bipap in ICU and was diuresed further. Pt was
eventually transitioned to night bipap only and tolerated. Pt
was then transferred to the floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
47yo woman with hypercarbic resp failure most likely due to
morbid obesity and hypoventilation.  In addition the patient was
recently diagnosed with Afib s/p TEE and cardioversion.  She was
likely chronically hypoxic and hypoventilating for a long period
of time and slowly retained a large amount of fluid.  She
developed Atrial Fib with RVR and presented to OSH.  She was
transferred to the ICU for concern re: need for emergent
intubation vs. tracheostomy.  She did well on bipap in the ICU,
was diuresed aggressively, and transferred to the floor.
1. Hypercarbic resp failure/Hypoxia:  Most likely due to
Obesity-Hypoventilation syndrome and OSA. In the ICU, pts BIPAP
settings were optimized on PSV/PEEP of 15/5.  The patient was
able to sleep well with these settings and her PO2 on morning
ABGs would average 90-100.  Her baseline ABG reflects a
respiratory acidosis with chronic renal compensation.  Part of
worsening hypercarbia on admission was attributed to aggressive
diuresis and relative increase in respiratory dead space.  The
patient was fluid resuscitated initially with improved
respiratory function and then as the patient became less hypoxic
she began to autodiurese.  She was averaging 1-
