Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
79 yo female, h/o CAD s/p CABG, HTN, hyperlipidemia, HTN,
presenting from [**Hospital6 **] s/p catheterization.  She
presented to [**Hospital3 **] today for a scheduled outpatient cath;
prior to this, she had been experiencing recurrent exertional
anginal symptoms.  She states that since [**Month (only) 1096**], she had been
experiencing exertional angina, described as pressure on her
chest, worse with walking/exertion, better with rest/SL NTG.
This was associated with SOB but she denied
n/v/palpitations/diaphoresis.  She had a MIBI at [**Hospital3 **] that
revealed a defect, and she was scheduled for an outpatient
elective catheterization.  Cardiac Enzymes checked prior to
catheterization were negative.  Her cath at [**Hospital3 **] on day of
admission revealed in-stent restenosis of her SVG-OM1-OM2
(jump).  She was transferred here for brachytherapy;
catheterization here revealed in-stent restenosis in
SVG-OMI-OM2, and angioplasty with brachytherapy was performed.
At the end of the procedure, she had some nausea/vomiting, and
when the sheath was pulled, she threw up a small amount of tarry
emesis.  Her hematocrit was checked and found to be 29.6 (repeat
30.3; had been 40 at OSH on [**4-29**]).  She denies any abdominal
pain, h/o ulcers, NSAID use, or history of bloody/melanotic
stools.  She was transferred to CCU for hemodynamic monitoring.

[**2155-5-2**]: US right groin without evidence of pseudoaneurysm or
fistula

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  GI bleed: Pt had a ?10 pt hematocrit drop after procedure.
Hct of 40 on [**4-29**] was likely hemoconcentrated (unlikely to have
such high hct in female of age 79).  She had hematoma prior to
sheath pull and a small amount of bloody emesis.  She was given
2 U PRBC upon transfer to the CCU with good hematocrit response.
 She was seen by GI who felt that no EGD was necessary.  Her
hematocrit remained stable while in-house, and she was
instructed to be look out for tarry stools (given will need to
be on ASA/Plavix).  NG lavage was initially deferred (needed to
lay flat after sheath pull) and not performed given hct
stability and no further emesis.  She will continue on protonix.
 Her coumadin was not restarted upon discharge (unclear
indication) and can be restarted at the discretion of her
PCP/cardiologist.  She will follow up with her PCP who will
decide if endoscopy is necessary in the future.

2.  CAD: s/p CABG with multiple episodes of ISR, s/p angioplasty
with brachytherapy to SVG-OM1-OM2.  She was continued on
ASA/Plavix.  ACEI/BB were initially held due to ?GI bleed but
restarted prior to discharge.  She had no EKG changes with drop
in hematocrit, and she was also continued on her Lipitor.  She
had no further episodes of chest pain while in-house. She had a
small bruit at site of catheterization without hematoma, but US
showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or fistula.

3.  CHF: EF unknown, takes Lasix at home.  This was initially
held in setting of ?GI bleed but restarted prior to discharge.

4.  Rhythm: She had some sinus bradycardia while in-house that
resolved prior to discharge.

5.  Dispo: She was discharged to follow up with her PCP and
Cardiologist.
