Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
Right upper lobe lung mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Right thoracoscopic right upper lobectomy with pleural tent
2.  Cervical mediastinoscopy with biopsy.
3.  Mediastinal nodal dissection.
4.  Flexible bronchoscopy.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a delightful 78-year-old gentleman with severe
COPD who was noted to have a small right upper lobe nodule in
[**2189**] and has been followed with serial imaging since. At that
time, a PET/CT scan showed no evidence of FDG activity within
the lesion. Due to his severe COPD, he was followed carefully.
Subsequent CT scans demonstrated growth in the lesion, which is
nearly doubled in size overall. In addition, there has been the
appearance of a new second nodule in the posterior segment of
the right upper lobe, which has also grown with time. These
nodules were separated by about 3-4 cm and normal lung tissue. A
recent PET/CT scan obtained in [**2193-6-25**] demonstrated FDG
uptake within both right upper lobe nodules as well as two small
lymph nodes adjacent to the left parotid gland. There is no
uptake within the mediastinal lymph nodes or of elsewhere within
the body of concern. He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2193-7-16**], which showed no endobronchial lesions, and a
bronchoalveolar lavage was nondiagnostic. He subsequently
underwent a CT-guided
fine needle biopsy on [**2193-8-2**], which confirmed the
presence of an adenocarcinoma consistent with bronchoalveolar
type.  The patient presents for surgical resection of his right
upper lobe.

He does suffer from dyspnea on exertion becoming dyspneic after
walking up two flights of stairs. He is able to walk
approximately three blocks without much dyspnea.

Other than some nocturia, he has otherwise been asymptomatic. He

specifically denies chest pain, hemoptysis, cough, chest pain,
fevers, chills, sweats, recent pulmonary infection, weight loss,

anorexia, or new neurological or new musculoskeletal complaints.

All other systems reviewed were otherwise negative.

Past Medical History:
1. severe COPD
2. spontaneous pneumothorax in [**2184**] on the right
3. prostate cancer treated with radioactive seed in [**2189**]
4. hemorrhoidectomy
5. decreased hearing.


Social History:
He is married, lives with his family. He smoked two packs a day
for 50 years, continues to smoke one pack per week. He worked as
a boiler man and also worked in the navy and was exposed to
asbestos. He has no significant alcohol use.


Family History:
COPD and lung cancer in siblings.

CXR - [**12-31**]
The right apical pneumothorax appears a tiny bit larger than it
was on the last two chest radiographs, although the change is
marginal. Otherwise, the right lung volume loss, pleural
thickening, and mediastinal shift remain stable. The right-sided
chest tube is unchanged in position. Chain sutures are again
noted in the right suprahilar region. There are now asbestos-
related pleural calcifications and aortic calcification. Heart
size is unchanged.

CONCLUSION: Minimally increased right apical pneumothorax,
likely insignificant and related to projection. Otherwise,
stable appearance.

[**12-23**] CTA
IMPRESSION:
1. No PE.
2. Severe emphysema. Calcified pleural plaques.
3. Small residual right pneumothorax. Two right-sided chest
tubes appear in good position.
4. 3.1-cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm. Extensive atherosclerotic
disease.
5. Small hypodense lesions in the liver are incompletely
characterized but may represent cysts or hemangiomas.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and had a right thoracoscopic right
upper lobectomy, cervical mediastinoscopy with biopsy,
mediastinal nodal dissection, and flexible bronchoscopy which he
tolerated well.  The patient had a chest tube and a mediastinal
drain placed in his right pleural space.  This was placed to
suction with a leak present.  On post-op day 1, the patient had
an episode of repiratory distress with SaO2 in the 80s on 3
liters O2 via nasal cannula.  Wheezes and rhonchi were
auscultated.  The patient was given albuterol/ipratropium
nebulizer treatments, nasal canula was switched to shovel mask,
and SaO2 increased to 100%. An ecg showed no acute changes.  On
post-op day 2, the patient had another episode of respiratory
distress and was transferred to the ICU for further management.
The patient was started on Levoquin empirically.  Steroids were
also started for the patient's history of COPD.  In the ICU, the
patient also developed atrial flutter.  The patient was placed
on a diltiazem drip and converted back to sinus rhythm.  Serial
ABGs were obtained to ensure that the patient was not becoming
hypoxemic or hypercarbic. On [**12-21**] chest tube was d/c'd, [**Doctor Last Name **]
was left to bulb.  He had an episode of destauration in the ICU
that reslved after bronchoscopy suctioned out a lot of thick
secretions.  Pulm was alos consulted to help manage his COPD.
He was treated with Solumedrol and weaned to PO steroids for his
COPD.  He was also placed on BIPAP which helped as well.  He was
transfused 1 PRBC for a HCT of 26 on [**12-22**] and given lasix.  He
was out of bed an remained in the ICU only as long as he did
mostly because of a bed issue.  On [**12-25**] [**Doctor Last Name **] was d/c'd. small
leak in remaing CT.  Remained chest tube was clamped and removed
and he was started per pulm recs on an outpt COPD regimine.  he
was transferred to the floor where he did well, worked with PT
and was discharged home in good condition.
