Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted through ER for complaint of abd pain, nausea, and
change in mental status. Concern was greatest for superior
mesenteric artery syndrome versus small bowel obstruction, based
on pt's surgical history. CT scan revealed a high-grade
obstruction, free fluid, and a transition point. This situation
was explained to the patient, who verbalized good understanding
and consented to the plan for operative management after a
complete discussion of the risks and benefits and all her
questions were answered. Initially pt's INR was 4.7, and this
was appropriately corrected with FFP. Pt underwent an
exploratory laparotomy, in which a strangulating band was lysed,
and the bowel was deemed healthy and viable. She was transferred
to the SICU post-operatively to optimize her pulmonary status.
Pt was extubated on [**12-22**] without incident. Pt was restarted on
her Lasix, as she began to exhibit signs of CHF, and was
maintained on nitroglycerin drips for BP control. Pt did have
occasional episodes of agitation, but her mental status cleared,
her BP control was optimized, and she was transferred to the
floor on [**12-24**]. Coumadin, a chronic medication for her atrial
fibrillation, was restarted on [**12-25**]. Her mental status continued
to improve, and her oral intake also improved. Pt continued to
have occasional desaturations to the high 80s, despite being on
a facemask, although this significantly improved with nebulizer
treatments. Pt is likely to require home oxygen for some time. A
chest x-ray from [**12-26**] revealed no effusions or infiltrates. On
[**12-27**] pt continued to do well and was deemed suitable for transfer
back to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab's [**Location (un) 550**].
