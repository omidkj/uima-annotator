HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old male
former x-ray technician, who was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital on [**2113-3-8**] with complaints of shortness of
breath x2 days.  The patient denied having any chest pain at
that time, however, noted that he had experienced a dry cough
with a fever prior to this admission.  The patient was
admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with pneumonia and a non-ST
elevation myocardial infarction where he was treated with
intravenous antibiotics.  During this hospitalization, the
patient underwent a myoview ST which demonstrated ischemia.
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization on [**2113-3-14**], which demonstrated multi-vessel disease.

The patient was subsequently admitted to the Cardiothoracic
Service on [**2113-3-15**] for planned coronary artery bypass
graft.

5. Atrial fibrillation.
6. Glaucoma.
7. Non-Q wave myocardial infarction in [**2113-2-28**].
8. Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.

1. Lopressor.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is a former smoker and quit
approximately 20 years ago, but previously demonstrated a 60
pack year smoking history.  Lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) **],
[**State 350**].  The patient is a retired x-ray technician at
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service, at which point he underwent a cardiac
catheterization on [**2113-3-14**].  Catheterization
demonstrated 40-50% occlusion of the LMCA, 60% occlusion of
the left anterior descending artery, 80% occlusion of the
left circumflex, and 80% occlusion of the right coronary
artery.  The patient was subsequently recommended for
coronary artery bypass graft to be scheduled on [**2113-3-15**].

On [**2113-3-15**], the patient underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft x3 with anastomosis of the LIMA to the left
anterior descending artery, aorta to the left PDA via
saphenous vein graft, and aorta to the OM via secondary
saphenous vein graft.  The pericardium was left open.  A line
was placed included an arterial line including a CVP/RA
catheter.  Wires initiated included ventricular and atrial
wires.  Tubes placed included mediastinal and a left pleural
tube.  Cross-clamp time was noted to be 95 minutes and bypass
time was noted to be 110 minutes.

The patient was subsequently transferred to the Cardiac
Surgery Recovery Unit in stable condition with a mean
arterial pressure of 81, CVP of 15, and an A-V paced heart
rate of 80.  On transfer, the patient was noted to be on
Neo-Synephrine and propofol drips at 0.5 and 10,
respectively.  Postoperative antibiosis was provided via
levofloxacin without complication.  Postoperative hematocrit
was noted to be 33.0.

In the CSRU, the patient did well, and was successfully
extubated on postoperative day one.  The patient was
successfully weaned off his Neo-Synephrine drip on
postoperative day #2, after which point he was started on
Lopressor dose as scheduled.

On postoperative day #3, the patient was noted to demonstrate
atrial fibrillation refractory to initial rate control with
Lopressor.  The patient was subsequently started on
amiodarone with initial bolus and subsequent po dose
scheduled.  The patient remained in intermittent atrial
fibrillation for the duration of his stay, requiring
continued doses with Lopressor and amiodarone.

Beginning on postoperative day #3, [**2113-3-19**], the
patient was noted to have increased agitation with a
leukocytosis to 19.3 confirmed by complete blood count.  In
addition, the patient was noted to have increased drainage
from his sternal wound as well as new onset, persistent
diarrhea.  Infectious Disease consultation resulted in
panculturing, which subsequently demonstrated the patient to
be positive for Clostridium difficile colitis.  The patient
was subsequently begun on Vancomycin, aztreonam, and Flagyl,
in addition to his Levaquin dose.  The patient remained on
this antibiotic regimen through [**2113-3-23**], over which
time he demonstrated gradual improvement in his symptoms of
diarrhea, and diminution in his white blood cell count.

The patient was subsequently tapered to Vancomycin and Flagyl
only beginning on [**2113-3-24**].  The patient was gradually
transitioned to clear po intake on [**3-24**], and was
subsequently noted to be tolerant of full po for the duration
of his stay.

On postoperative day #12, [**2113-3-27**], the patient
underwent placement of a PICC line for continued IV axis for
IV antibiotics.  The patient was subsequently transferred to
the floor, where he was admitted to the Cardiothoracic
Service under the direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].  Due to
continued breakdown of the sternal wound site, the patient
was also begun on a VAC dressing with regular q5 day dressing
changes.

The patient continued to progress well clinically through
postoperative day #15, [**2113-3-30**], with transition to po
antibiotics, and controlled, but persistent atrial
fibrillation.  Patient was subsequently cleared for discharge
to rehabilitation facility on postoperative day #15, [**2113-3-30**] with instructions for followup.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged to
rehabilitation facility with instructions for followup.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg po q day.
2. Timolol/dorzolam 0.5-2% drops on drop ophthalmic [**Hospital1 **].
3. Tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg q24h.
4. Haldol 0.5 mg po bid.
5. Lopressor 50 mg po bid.
6. Vancomycin 250 mg/5 mL solution, 2.5 mL po q6h x10 days.
7. Flagyl 500 mg po tid x10 days.
8. Coumadin 2 mg po q day, titrate to INR of 2.0 to 2.5.
9. Amiodarone 400 mg po q day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient's VAC dressing is to be
changed every five days until follow-up appointment.  The
patient is to maintain his incisions clean and dry at all
times.  The patient may shower, but should pat dry incisions
afterwards; no bathing or swimming until further notice.  The
patient is to limit physical activity; no heavy exertion.
Coumadin is to be titrated to an INR of 2.0 to 2.5 via daily
coagulation study blood draws.  The patient is to continue
Vancomycin and Flagyl therapy for 10 days following discharge
to rehabilitation facility for completion of Clostridium
difficile therapy.  The patient may resume a regular diet.
The patient is to followup with his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**12-1**] weeks and with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] in four weeks.  The
patient is to call to schedule these appointments.
