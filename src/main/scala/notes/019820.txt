Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old male with
hypertension and hyperlipidemia transferred from [**Hospital3 1442**] Hospital for treatment of a biliary obstruction and
further Intensive Care Unit management of multiorgan failure.

The patient sought medical attention in early [**2191-5-21**] at
[**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital after developing the gradual onset
of dyspnea, left shoulder pain, low-grade fevers, and a
30-pound weight loss.  A chest x-ray suggested bibasilar
consolidation, with chest CT showing mediastinal and hilar
adenopathy as well.  He was treated for community-acquired
pneumonia with clinical improvement and was discharged from
the hospital.

He presented again later in the month with right lower
extremity swelling and shortness of breath.  He was diagnosed
with deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.  The
patient underwent a hypercoagulability workup which showed he
was heterozygous for the factor V Leiden.  He was placed on
enoxaparin and Coumadin and discharged from the hospital;
eventually achieving a supratherapeutic INR.

He returned to the hospital on [**6-29**] with new left lower
extremity pain, and swelling, and increased dyspnea, as well
as fever and was found to have a new left lower extremity
deep venous thrombosis and likely recurrent pulmonary emboli
despite anticoagulation.  His subsequent hospital course was
complicated.  He received [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter and underwent a
malignancy workup including an abdominal CT which revealed
pancreatic fullness.  A CA19-9 level measured greater than
3000, suspicious for pancreatic cancer.  He developed
increasing abdominal distention with ascites and visible
jaundice with total bilirubin of greater than 10, and an
alkaline phosphatase level of greater than 1000.  An
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was attempted
on two occasions; however, the bile duct could not be
cannulated.  In the midst of this, he developed multiorgan
failure with hypoxemic respiratory failure and oliguric renal
failure, requiring intubation, fluid resuscitation, and the
institution of pressors and antibiotics.  He was noted to be
in right heart failure; presumably as a result of multiple
pulmonary emboli.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for biliary drainage and further
management of his multiorgan dysfunction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  History of positive purified protein derivative.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Low back pain.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications on transfer included
heparin drip, Flagyl, gentamicin, vancomycin, Protonix,
Unasyn, morphine as needed, as well as Ativan as needed.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was married with one son and
daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] is a retired mailman.  He is a former tobacco
user; having a 60-pack-year history and quit 10 years ago.
No history of ethanol abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was positive for coronary
artery disease in his father.  [**Name (NI) **] cancer in his mother and
brother.  [**Name (NI) **] had a brother with prostate cancer.  Another
brother had kidney cancer.  Another brother had pancreatic
cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on presentation revealed an intubated, sedated, obese,
elderly, white male.  His temperature was 100.6, heart rate
was 126, blood pressure was 95/66, respiratory rate was 22,
SpO2 was 96% on assisted control ventilation, 800 X 22, with
an FIO2 of 1.00.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed
scleral icterus.  Pupils were constricted and sluggish.  The
oropharynx was edentulous with an endotracheal tube in place.
Neck was full with a right internal jugular venous catheter
in place.  Heart was tachycardic and regular with a right
ventricular heave.  Lungs revealed crackles at the right
base; otherwise, clear anteriorly.  The abdomen was markedly
distended.  No guarding or rebound.  Decreased breath sounds.
Positive fluid wave.  Extremities revealed 2+ pitting edema
bilaterally.  The extremities were cool.  Pulses were
dopplerable.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission to [**Hospital1 69**] showed a
white blood cell count of 25.9 (with 84% neutrophils and
8% bands), hematocrit was 37.2, platelets were 654.  PT
was 19.2, INR was 2.6, PTT was 77.7.  Sodium was 132,
potassium was 5.1, chloride was 97, bicarbonate was 17, blood
urea nitrogen was 66, creatinine was 3.7, blood glucose
was 118.  Total bilirubin was 13.2, AST was 77, ALT was 42,
alkaline phosphatase was 814, albumin was 2.1.  Calcium
was 7.9, magnesium was 2.3, phosphate was 7.9.  Vancomycin
level was 16.3.  Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity
of 1.025, cloudy/brown with large blood, pH was 6.5, trace
ketones, protein of 30, large amount of urobilinogen, red
blood cells of [**Pager number **], white blood cells of 4, no bacteria.
Urine sodium was less than 10.  Urine eosinophils were not
seen.  Arterial blood gas on the above-listed ventilatory
settings showed a pH of 7.34, PCO2 of 33, PO2 of 139, lactate
measured 2.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management of biliary
obstruction and multiorgan dysfunction.

He underwent immediate endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography with biliary drainage and stenting.
The drainage was noted to be purulent and ultimately grew out
enterococcus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and
lactobacillus.  He was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics,
including piperacillin, and tazobactam, levofloxacin, and
vancomycin.

He was maintained on assist-control ventilation with high
positive end-expiratory pressures to maintain oxygenation and
to compensate for his high pleural pressures, as extrapolated
from esophageal balloon measurements.  A Swan-Ganz catheter
was placed which revealed a high cardiac index and low
systemic vascular resistance, consistent with septic shock.
His pulmonary artery pressures were severely elevated,
presumably as a result of massive pulmonary emboli. He
required pressors despite adequate volume resuscitation.  He
was noted to have gram-negative species in his sputum, and
chest imaging revealed a moderate, multiloculated,
right-sided pleural effusion with associated consolidation.

He underwent a thoracentesis under ultrasound guidance which
showed an exudative process with a pH of 7.1, and a glucose
of less than 60.  A chest tube was placed for drainage, as it
was determined under surgical consultation that he would
unlikely tolerate a video-assisted thoracotomy.  He underwent
multiple therapeutic paracenteses in order to assist with his
ventilator management, given a markedly distended abdomen.
The peritoneal fluid was sterile, though had a low serum
albumin to ascites gradient, consistent with peritoneal
carcinomatosis.

Cytology from the peritoneal specimen ultimately showed
adenocarcinoma.  The hepatobiliary Surgical Service followed
closely throughout his hospitalization; however, the patient
continued to deteriorate.  He continued to require pressors
and fluids with continued high fevers and worsening renal
function.

Given his grave prognosis, his family ultimately elected to
withdraw further care; taking into account the patient's
prior stated wishes.  The patient was extubated on [**7-15**].
He was pronounced dead shortly thereafter at 4:15 p.m.   His
family was present at the bedside.  Postmortem examination
was declined.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Adenocarcinoma; presumably of pancreatic origin.
2.  Biliary sepsis.
3.  Multiorgan failure.
