[**2106-12-9**]: CTA: 1.  Filling defect in the right upper lobe apical
segmental pulmonary arterial branch consistent with a pulmonary
embolism.
2.  Mosaic attenuation in the upper lobes bilaterally could
represent air trapping, small airways disease, or alveolitis.
Additionally, there are multiple areas of ground-glass opacity
predominantly in a bronchovascular distribution in the upper
lobes, left worse than right with additional areas that are more
peripherally located.  This finding is nonspecific, however,
given the patient's history, early infectious process including
opportunistic infection could be considered.  Depending on the
degree/nature of the patient's immunocompromised status,
pneumocystis jerovici could also be considered.
3.  Atelectasis in the lingula and left lower lobe.
4.  Nonspecific cluster of nodular opacities in the right lower
lobe.
.
[**2106-12-9**]: CXR: Resolution of left lower lobe pneumonia. New
left-sided pleural effusion, small
.
[**2106-12-11**]: CXR: Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is normal.
There is again seen some hazy opacity at the left base which may
represent early infiltrate versus atelectasis. There is also a
new area of increased density within the left upper lung zone,
also concerning for developing infiltrate. The right lung is
clear. There is no signs of pulmonary edema. There is a left
pleural effusion, which is small.
.
[**2106-12-17**]; CXR: 1. Persistent left upper lobe consolidation, most
likely infectious.  2. Resolution of left retrocardiac
atelectasis.
.
[**2106-12-19**]: CXR: Continued left upper lobe infiltrate
.
[**2106-12-20**]: CT Chest: 1. Left lower lobe pneumonia has resolved.
2. Generalized increase in multifocal peribronchial
infiltration, particularly left upper lobe, could be due to
either opportunistic infection, typically viral or pneumocystis,
or recurrence of graft versus host disease, less likely
hemorrhage, and not fungal or bacterial infection.  3. New
pneumomediastinum, presumably related to coughing or
bronchospasm in the absence of mediastinal fluid collection or
esophageal abnormality. 4. Multifocal air trapping, presumably
bronchiolitis obliterans.  5. Anterior extrapleural/chest wall
mass or infection, stable since [**12-9**], new since [**6-15**].
This lesion should be accessible to transthoracic needle
aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 30 yo woman with h/o AML s/p allo BMT
presenting with fever, hypoxia, a small PE and ground-glass
opacities on CT scan.  Hospital course by problem:
.
# Respiratory/ID: The patient was admitted from the emergency
department to the ICU for evaluation and treatment of her severe
hypoxia (70%). She did not require intubation as she had
excellent oxygen saturations with non-invasive measures. The
source of her hypoxia was not readily identified, but possible
contributing etiologies considered were: PCP pneumonia, [**Name Initial (PRE) **] known
PE seen on CTA, atypical/fungal infection, or GVHD of the lung.
She was given broad spectrum antibiotics including vanco, zosyn,
azithro and bactrim DS 2 tabs TID.  Labs were sent as above.
Bronchoscopy was considered but there was concern she would be
unable to tolerate it given her poor respiratory status.  The
infectious diseases team was consulted.  She was transitioned to
azithro and pip/tazo to complete a 14 day course for unknown
opportunistic/atypical organism.  Her respiratory status
improved and she was transferred to the floor.  She was weaned
down from 6L O2 and was able to ambulate while on 3L.  We
discharged the patient with home O2 with goal of O2 sat greater
than 92%.  We also prescribed nebulizers (albuterol and
ipratropium).  She will return to the clinic on Sunday (two days
after dispo) for O2 monitoring.
.
# Respiratory/PE: The patient had a small PE on her initial CT
angiogram.  She was treated with heparin and transitioned to
lovenox 90mcg [**Hospital1 **].  She was continued on this upon discharge.
.
# Respiratory/Inflammation: The patient had a followup CT scan
after transfer to the floor.  It was concerning for
bronchiolitis obliterans given the airtrapping.  We increased
her steroids to 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and she continued to improve
clinically.  We also increased her cellcept prior to discharge.
.
# AML: s/p BMT and DLI. We did not notice any blasts in her
peripheral white blood cells.  We continued her cellcept and
prednisone for her history of GVH.  We also continued the
bactrim prophylaxis.  We increased the cellcept prior to
discharge.  We also added acyclovir to her prophylaxis.  We did
not start vori or fluc given her transaminitis.
.
# Nodular mass on anterior chest wall: Both of the CT chest
scans showed a nodular mass on the anterior chest wall.  We
discussed this with the radiologist and it was not clearly
infectious in etiology.  She did not have any tenderness over
this region.  We did not perform a biopsy of the lesion.  It
