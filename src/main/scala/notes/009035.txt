Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
51yo woman w/severe COPD on home O2 and home BIPAP who presented
to the ED c/o worsening SOB x2 weeks. She initially developed
this 2 weeks ago at which point she called her [**First Name3 (LF) 19039**] who
started her on prednisone 40 and azithro. She did not feel any
better after five days of azithromycin, so she was then treated
with levofloxacin (last day day of admission). She finished the
prednisone 2 days prior to admission. She reports increasing
shortness of breath to the point where she cannot walk from the
bathroom to the bedroom. This is also accompanied by bilateral
chest pain that feels like "lung soreness", and resolves with
rest. It is also accompanied by mild nausea. She initially had a
productive cough of thick green sputum which was somewhat better
after the antibiotic treatment but still present. She traveled
recently to [**State 760**] via bus and may have had sick contacts.
She was originally using her nebulizer treatments up to 4x/day
which was helpful, but has stopped doing that lately.

In the ED, she was initially saturating 68% on 1L, which
increased to 94% on 4L. She then became somewhat confused and so
the oxygen was turned down. On admission, she was saturating in
the 80s on 1L. She was put on nasal CPAP on her home settings
([**9-11**]). Her ABG was 7.39/56/50. She was given albuterol and
atrovent nebulizers, solumedrol, and aspirin.

Past Medical History:
1. COPD, followed in pulmonary by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. [**5-13**] PFTs show
FEV1 of 1.04, which is 42 percent of predicted, and a FVC of
2.11, which is 65 percent of predicted. FEV1/FVC ratio is 0.49
Full PFTs from [**10-12**] also showed diffusion capacity 45% pred.
Exercise oximetry showed O2 sat 88%RA at rest, which decreased
to 80% w/ambulation. ABG at that time 7.34/56/52 on RA.
2. Hep C
3. Hx IVDA, on methadone maintenance
4. Hx seizure d/o

Brief Hospital Course:
51yo woman with COPD admitted to the ICU w/ COPD exacerbation,
transferred to the floor after solumedrol, nebulizers, and BiPAP
(home settings), with quick resolution to baseline oxygenation.

Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:

1. COPD exacerbation: s/p levofloxacin and azithromycin as an
outpatient. She was treated with advair, atrovent nebulizers,
albuterol nebs (concern for chest pain, see below), solumedrol,
BIPAP, O2 prn. She was not given supplemental O2 unless her
saturations were <88%, since this caused oxygen narcosis. She
was given solumedrol and discharged with a prednisone taper. She
was discharged with saturations in the mid-90's on room air.
completed courses of levo/azithro prior to admit

2. Chest pain: She had an episode of chest pain prior to
admission that was likely related to her COPD exacerbation. She
had no EKG changes and cardiac enyzmes were negative. She was
monitored by telemetry without events. The pain seemed to be
associated with beta-agonists, so these were minimized. She was
continued on aspirin and started on atorvastatin for
hyperlipidemia. She had an appointment scheduled with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on discharge to further work up the chest pain, as it
sounded cardiac in etiology (left-sided, into left arm,
associated with beta agonists). She may benefit from a stress
test, or possibly should go directly to catheterization, to be
determined by cardiology.

3. Leukocytosis: Thought to be due to steroids or stress
response. Bcx were negative. She had already completed
levofloxacin and azithromycin courses for COPD exacerbation. She
remained afebrile throughout hospitalization.

4. Anemia: Her Hct fell from 36 to 30, which was thought to be
due to hydration. Her studies were consistent with iron
deficiency. She was started on iron. Would benefit from
outpatient work up including colonoscopy.

5. Seizure disorder: She was continued on keppra.

6. IVDU: Her methadone maintenance was continued.
