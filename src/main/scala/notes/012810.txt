CXR on admission:
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in previously noted right
middle lobe and
lingular opacities. No new consolidation or evidence of
pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 41 yo man w/ COPD, DM, Polysubstance abuse, here w/ COPD
exacerbation and poorly controled glucose.
.
#Diabetes: patient has a history of fragile diabetes, poor
control and a sensitivity to glucocorticoids.  On admission he
was hypovolemic [**2-5**] hyperglycemia osmotic diuresis.  He is
followed by the [**Last Name (un) **] and they are seeing him in the hospital.
His current HgA1C=10.9.  A urine tox screen was positive for
cocaine.  See substance abuse below.  Cocaine and prednisone
caused the extreme disturbance in his glucose control.
His steroid course was quickly tapperd in order to improve his
glucose control. However, before discharge his blood sugar was
129 and he was sent home on NPH 20 [**Hospital1 **] and HISS plus his sliding
scale. He was instructed to keep close monitoring of his sugars
for the next week and to attend his follow up [**Hospital1 4314**] next
week. He was instructed to call [**Last Name (un) **] for assistance if needed.
.
#COPD exacerbation: Patient has extensive COPD secondary to
alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and presented with shortness of
breath and a flare of his COPD. No new oxygen requirment. He has
been hospitalized 5 in last 9mo for exacerbations, responds to
levofloxacin/azithro .  The CXR was not consistent with
infection however he has a history of multiple PNA admissions,
likely has bronchitis vs. a viral etiology (influenza).  Ruled
out influenza A/B, adeno, parainfluenza and RSV on rapid screen.
 Unclear whether this is natural hx or there is an underlying
reason for frequent exacerbations (? crack use or other illicit
use, as cocaine positive).  He was treated with a seven day
course of levofloxacin 750mg PO daily.  Fluticasone propionate
and fluticasone-salmeterol were continued.  Standing ipratropium
Q6H and Xopenex Q6H nebs were given.  His course of prednisone
was tapered down from 40mg to 5mg (D/C on 20mg).  He will stay
on 5mg until his adrenal function can be assessed in the
outpatient setting.
.
#Substance Abuse: Patient presented with blood glucose levels in
the 400s that were not responsive to insulin.  This was found to
be [**2-5**] cocaine use as evident by UA.  After confrontation
patient admitted x1 use 6 days prior to admission.  He was
educated about the side effects and dangers of not reporting
substance use when being treated in the hospital.
.
#Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency: has complications of COPD and
cirrhosis.  During his stay his ALT was elevate to 93 from
baseline of 30; AST, Tbili and INR were normal during his stay.
He is followed at [**Hospital1 112**] and receives weekly arala
