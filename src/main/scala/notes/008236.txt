Radiography/micro/studies
[**5-2**] RUQ U/S: The liver is normal in echotexture with no focal
lesions. The gallbladder is normal appearing. There is no intra-
or extra-hepatic ductal dilatation. The common bile duct
measures 2 mm. There is appropriate forward portal venous flow.
The spleen is at the upper limits of normal in size measuring 12
cm. The right kidney measures 10.8 cm. The left kidney measures
10.8 cm. There is no ascites. The pancreatic head and neck are
within normal limits. The body and tail are obscured by
overlying bowel gas.
.
[**5-2**]: Admit CXR: Multifocal patchy somewhat spherical
parenchymal opacities, of uncertain chronicity; differential
diagnosis includes multifocal pneumonia (including septic emboli
and aspergillus), aspiration, and pulmonary hemorrhage related
to vasculitis. Dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph or CT
scan may be helpful for more complete characterization
.
[**5-2**] EKG: NSR, NI NA no acute ST-T changes
.
[**5-4**]: BAL Washings: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Numerous
pulmonary macrophages.  No viral cytopathic changes or fungal
organisms seen
.
[**5-4**]: CT Chest: 1. Multifocal poorly defined lung nodules and
wedge shaped consolidation, with slight improvement since recent
outside CT scan. Although nonspecific, in the setting of
hemoptysis, a vasculitis such as limited Wegener's
granulomatosis or other pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome should be
considered. Differential diagnosis includes cryptogenic
organizing pneumonia and/or infection (especially angioinvasive
Aspergillus and Mucor). Malignancy such as BAC is much less
likely given improvement since recent scan.   2. New left lower
lobe consolidation and rapidly evolving right lower lobe
consolidation most likely represents aspiration or hemorrhage.
.
[**5-5**]: BAL/VATS Cytology:
1.  Lung, right lower lobe, wedge resection (A-H):
a.  Organizing pneumonitis, see note.
b.  Focal accumulation of alveolar macrophages consistent with
respiratory bronchiolitis.
2.  Lung, right lower lobe, wedge resection #2 (I-L):
a.  Organizing pneumonitis, see note.
b.  Focal accumulation of alveolar macrophages consistent with
respiratory bronchiolitis.
Note;  The organizing pneumonitis has features consistent with
bronchiolitis obliterans/organizing pneumonia (BOOP/COP).
.
[**5-8**]: Repeat CT Chest: FINDINGS: Multiple poorly defined nodular
opacities scattered throughout the lungs have slightly improved
from [**2111-5-4**]. The largest opacity containing an air
bronchogram in the right middle lobe is also slightly smaller
measuring 3.0 x 1.5 cm (previously 3.3 x 2.4 cm), as well as
improvement of additional right upper and lower lobe
consolidations, and left pleural effusion. The right pleural
effusion has increased along with an enlarging right basilar
opacity, but this is at the site of recent VATS and is most
likely post- surgical. Centrilobular emphysema is most prominent
in the apices. The heart and great vessels of the mediastinum
are unchanged, remarkable for multiple lymph nodes measuring up
to 10 mm. The visualized abdomen is unremarkable aside from two
simple subcentimeter hepatic cysts. There is a small
subcutaneous emphysema post-VATS. No suspicious lesions are
identified in the bones.  IMPRESSION:
1. Improving multifocal lung abnormalities.
2. Increase in right pleural effusion and focal opacities at
biopsy site, likely post-operative.
.
Discharge CXR on [**5-10**]: Further improvement in pulmonary opacities
with residual poorly defined scattered opacities remaining.
Small residual pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
38yo man who presented with fevers, rigos, chills, and
hemoptysis from OSH.  Hospital course will start with MICU
course then proceed below:
.
In MICU coags and Hct were stable, pt underwent bronch which
showed diffuse blood in bronchi, indeterminant source. Given
multiple nodules seen on CT from OSH and hemoptysis, cancer, TB,
and autoimmune (Wegner's and Goodpasture's) were prime
consideration.  He was covered for pneumonia with levaquin. He
was originally on Vancomycin as OSH blood cultures were known to
be positive for gram positive organisms, however, this was
discontinued once these were speciated as micococcus in one
bottle and bacillus in other bottle, both likely contaminants.
BAL was sent and showed no microorganisms and no malignant
cells.   Extensive lab workup as above.  He was stabilized and
transferred to the floor.  By problem:
.
# Hemoptysis/pulm nodules: The differential was very broad.  Lab
data as above did not support the diagnosis of wegener's
granulomatous disease.  Additionally, [**Doctor First Name **] was only weakly
positive.  HIV was negative.  anti GBM was negative.  He was AFB
neg x3.  The biopsy results suggested COP/BOOP which also did
not point to a clear source.  He did not have any ep
