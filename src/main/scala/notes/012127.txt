Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, cough, LE edema.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
61F w/ pulm fibrosis on 12L NC at home, presenting to ED with 2d
h/o cough, SOB and b/l LE swelling. History provided by patient
and husband. Pt has had increased cough and SOB for 2 days.
Cough occasionally productive of clear sputum, mucus plus
occasionayll tinged with blood. No fevers or chills. No CP. No
nausea or vomiting or abdominal pain. ROS + for loose stools, no
blood or melena. Just found out someone she was in contact with
yesterday called in to work sick today, but symptoms precede
this exposure. Has been in contact with sister whose [**Name2 (NI) 802**] had a
cold recently, but not [**Name2 (NI) 802**] herself. LE swelling is chronic per
husband - she is largely immobile and sits in her chair all day.
She has been getting her pulm care at [**Hospital1 2177**] for the past year,
last hosp there 3 weeks ago. She has discussed getting lung
transplant with [**Hospital1 112**] but has been non-compliant with PT and, due
to her poor mobility, is no longer a candidate for transplant.
She is attempting a chemotherapeutic infusion in a few weeks to
treat her lung disease.
.
In the ED she triggered upon arrival for low O2 sat in the low
80%. Other VS were: 95.1, 100, 136/89, 22, 91% on 15L NC. She
was A&Ox3, had b/l pitting edema to knees, fine crackles 50% up
her lungs (per a note, these crackles may be her baseline). CXR
was done which showed new moderate bibasilar opacities, may
represent superimposed effusion/infiltrate, last CXR [**2192**]. BNP
>6000 (no baseline in OMR). Was given combivent, solumedrol, and
azithromycin for possible pna. After these interventions pt felt
she was at her baseline. Obtained PA/Lateral CXR prior to
transfer to MICU. At the time of transfer vitals were 101, bp
118/77, 92% NRB, rr 25.
.
On arrival to the MICU, VS 96.1, 125/60, 90% on NRB, 106. Pt
appears uncomfortable and deferring most questions to husband.

Radiology:
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2195-11-16**] 3:03 PM
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is a
further mild
increase in extent and severity of the pre-existing bilateral
peripheral
opacities. In light of the history of pulmonary fibrosis, these
findings
could indicate progressing exacerbation, overlying edema or
pneumonia. The
size of the cardiac silhouette is constant.

[**11-16**] CTA chest: 1. Progression of widespread interstitial lung
disease.
2. Increased centrilobular ground-glass opacity and reticular
markings in
right and left upper lobes most likely represent progression of
interstitial lung disease, but cannot exclude superimposed
pneumonia or edema  3. Pulmonary arterial hypertension with
enlarged right heart and bowing of interatrial septum into the
left atrium and reflux in to IVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo female with pulm fibrosis [**12-24**] hypersensitivity pneumonitis
on 12L NC at home, presenting to ED with 2d h/o cough, SOB and
b/l LE swelling with hypoxia/increased oxygen requirement from
baseline.  This was felt to be most likely progression of her
interstitial lung disease, so she was started on high dose
methylprednisolone.  She was also empirically started on
vanc/cefepime/levo for HCAP coverage, Bactrim as well for PCP
coverage since pt chronically on steroids, heparin drip, nebs,
and lasix IV for diuresis.  Blood, urine, sputum, and
nasopharyngeal cxrs were obtained.  No evidence of PE so heparin
was stopped the evening of admission.  CT showed worsening in
areas of prior disease which was consistent with progression of
existing lung disease.  No focal consolidation to suggest PNA
and no diffuse ground glass opacities suggesting PCP PNA, so [**Name9 (PRE) 621**]
also stopped.  PCP was negative so bactrim was decreased to a
prophylactic dose.  Pt diuresed over three liters the first
night of admission but there was no significant change in O2
status; in fact, she was mildly worsened.  Discussed care with
husband who wanted to pursue transplant in [**Location (un) 5622**].  Call
made on behalf of family but transplant center refused patient
as transplant candidate due to her poor respiratory status.  Pt
remained stable in unit but with unremitting high O2
requirement.  Discussion began regarding end of life care and
palliative care was consulted.  Patient and husband informed of
poor prognostic status.  Patient and husband voiced their
preferences for end of life care including no needle sticks,
finger sticks, or lab draws moving her to comfort measures only.
 She was given lorazepam
