Chest CT [**2116-12-21**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Large multiloculated nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion,
decreased
slightly since [**12-15**].
2. Right chest wall graft intact. No associated abscess.
3. Moderate pulmonary edema increased.
4. Right bronchial stump intact.
5. Stable reactive central adenopathy.
6. Stable moderate sliding hiatus hernia.
7. No new emboli in large pulmonary arteries. Subsegmental left
lung emboli are all that remain.

Chest CT [**2118-12-15**]; IMPRESSIONS:
1. Multiple left-sided segmental and subsegmental pulmonary
emboli.
2. Post- operative changes on the right after right upper
lobectomy including increasing fluid and small amount of
residual air within the pleural space, and subcutaneous gas
along the chest wall. Rounded opacity in the right lung base
could represent rounded atelectasis, although infection cannot
be excluded.
3. New reticulation with ground-glass attenuation along the
posterior left
upper lobe could represent aspiration or infection. Trace left
pleural
effusion.
4. Large hiatal hernia.

[**Doctor First Name **] study [**2117-12-17**]: There is thrombus in the right cephalic vein
which is a superficial vein, otherwise no thrombus is seen.
Duplex and color Doppler of both lower extremities demonstrates
thrombus within the peroneal veins only.

[**2117-12-17**]:Cytology. Pleural fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**12-15**]: Patient was admitted to SICU after CT showed multiple
segmental & subsegmental left pulmonary emboli involving both
lobes, as well as a loculated R pleural effusion, a heparin
bolus was given, followed by a drip, together with Zosyn for
possible pneumonia.
[**12-16**]: a pleural tap produced 1.5 L of transudative fluid
[**12-17**]: The patient was triggered fro transient hypoxia, resolved
spontaneously on 4 L N/C O2. R pleural effusion found to be
recurring.
[**12-18**]: coumadin 3 given.
[**12-19**]: The patient had an acute desaturation with sinus
tachycardia, likely a CHF exacerbation, he received IV lasix and
lopressor and was transferred back to ICU. Cultures of pleural
fluid were negative, so the patient's antibiotics were
discontinued. A foley was replaced and the patient given
additional Lasix with good response. The patient also expressed
suicidal ideation to the nursing staff.
[**12-20**]: Patient returned to floor, continued to receive coumadin
and heparin drip. Psychiatric consultant recommended starting
citalopram and changing seroquel to standing, both of which were
done.
[**12-22**]: A chest CT was done to further evaluate the loculated right
pleural effusion.  No further treatment was warrented at this
time. He was converted from heparin to lovenox. His Coumadin was
restarted with a goal INR 2.0-2.5 for pulmonary embolism.  He
will remain off Plavix while on coumadin. His foley was removed
and he voided without difficulty. He continued to do well and
was discharged to rehab on [**2117-12-23**].
