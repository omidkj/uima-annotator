Pleurex Catheter Placed-L sided


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with hx of hypothyroidism, Afib, CAD, HTN, new diagnosis
of GE junction lymphoma (s/p 3 months of radiation therapy with
tumor size [**1-5**] as before but now no longer candidate for
radiation therapy) who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with call0in
with tachypnea, RR 40's with frequent suctioning of very thick
mucous.
.
Came from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with complaints of SOB and DOE. He got
Morphine 8mg po x 1 at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab prior to transfer and
subsequently developed mental status changes. On arrival, he was
noted to have temp 101, BP 70/p, HR 120's, RR6, 99% on 100% NRB.
He was given IVF wide open, 2mg Narcan with ?positive response
([**Name8 (MD) **] RN taking care of him with response in BP to 130s). Then,
he was noted to have a poor gag reflex with RR 4 and thus was
intubated for airway protection (getting succinylcholine and
etomidate). He was then started on versed for sedation. Shortly
after starting his versed, his BP was noted to be 77/45 and thus
was started on PERIPHERAL levophed while attempts made to place
a central line. After 20 minutes, IV infiltrated in arm and he
was given phentolamine at the IV site. His BP was 67/42 and
finally a R. groin line was placed. He was then started on
dopamine via R. groin line and became tachycardic and was
questionably was in VT and shocked 200J x 3 (no strips) and
started on lidocaine and magnesium. Currently on levophed at
6mcg/min and lido at 2mg/min wiht BP 92/49.He was also given 4L
of NS and IV ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, Flagyl.
.
Per son, he states that his father had been coughing white,
yellow sputum for about a week but did not complain of SOB or
chest pain. He states his mental status however has been the
same over the past couple of weeks and his baseline activity -
does not walk. Speaks in full conversations but has lapses of
memory at times.
.
Transferred to MICU for further care for respiratory failure,
and hypotension.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with hx of GE junction lymphoma (s/p radiation
therapy for palliation), afib, hypothyroidism who presents with
PNA and hypotension.
1. Hypotension - Likely secondary to medications given (morphine
initially then versed in the setting of intubation). Unlikely to
be secondary to septic shock given that he was not initially
hypotensive and only was hypotensive in the setting of lots of
morphine and then lots of versed. however, septic shock is
possible given large PNA and UTI. Doubt cardiac etiology for
hypotension. In MICU continued to be hypotensive requiring
pressors-levophed. Not thought to be septic shock micro data was
negative throughout his hospitalization. He was fluid
resusitated however remained on pressors until [**2-23**], he was
started on Hydrocort/fludrocort on [**2-21**] for adrenal
insufficiency. His BP remained stable off pressors and will
continue Hydrocort/fludrocort for a 7 day course which will end
on [**2-27**].
.
2. Mental status changes - Possibilities include infection with
PNA and UTI, new hyponatremia in the setting of free water in
his TFs (more likely to be the cause), medications including
lots of morphine. MICU Course, his mental status was difficult
to guage with him being intubated and sedated. Off sedation pt
seemed to improve with being able to follow commands with the
russian interpreter and per sons. head CT negative for masses or
bleeds; multiple lacunar infarcts present.
.
.
#. PNA with large effusion - likely cause of new tachypnea. MICU
course-pt was intubated for resp failure found to have large
malignant effusions. Had a pleurex cath placed which drained
>1L/day. Resp status improved. Pt was successfully extubated
[**2-17**] and remained stable and called out to floor. His pleurex
catheter fell out and re-accumulated his L-sided effusion. He
also completed a 7 day course of vanc/zosyn for nosocomial PNA.
On following day on the medicine floor he then developed
respiratory distress, he was transferred back to the MICU and
reintubated. On CTA found to have small R-sided pleural
effusions. He was started on hep gtt for PEs. On CTA also found
to have a deviated and narrowed trachea [**2-5**] metastatic lymphoma
surrounding trachea and compromising airway. Pt remained
intubated [**2-5**] airway protection.  On [**2-21**] he had 2nd pleurex
cath placed and connected to suction with continual drainage. He
was also trached on [**2-21**] surgically without complications.
Pleurex cath remained to suction, respiratory status improved.
On [**2-24**] started Trial on Trach Collar, however pt tired and was
put back on Vent. No complications post trach or pluerex cath.
.
#. UTI - will also be treated with abx as above. f/u cultures.
Completed 7 day course of Abx. No further UTI throughout MICU
course.
.
#.Rhythm - hx of afib. Unclear if he really had VT. He more
likely had rapid afib with dopamine wiht underlying LBBB which
made it look like VT. Unclear as no strips. In MICU developed AF
w/RVR was started on dilt gtt with success. Pt converted to NSR.
however he went back into AF was initially put on BB without
success. He was then loaded with Amiodorone for 1 day but was
poorly rate controlled. He was switched to dilt drip which had
good effect and converted to NSR. He was switched to PO dilt and
remained in NSR throughout MICU course. CE remained neg x3.
.
6. Hyponatremia - unclear if from lots of free water from tube
feeds. ?hypovolemic hyponatremia. Got 4L NS in ED. Recheck Na
level now.  In MICU hyponatremia not an issue.
.
7. Hyperkalemia - hemolyzed. Also received succinylcholine in
ED. No peaked T-waves on EKG. Throughout MICU course, no
hyperkalemia.
.
8. hypothyroidism - continued levothyroxine.
.
#. lymphoma of GE junction - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],oncologist notified. has
been getting palliative chemo but is no longer candidate for
further radiation.Per oncologist and MICU team, multiple
conversations had with family informing them of pt's extremely
poor prognosis. Per Oncologist, pt has days to weeks left given
poor prognosis, metastatic lymphoma now encasing carotids/major
vessels in neck as well as affecting/deviating trachea. Family
[**Hospital 5439**] hospice/palliative care, however family refused
palliative care services on multiple occasion. Documentation in
chart.
