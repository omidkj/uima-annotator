Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**]/[**Doctor Last Name **] TRANSFER FOR PREHYDRATION ON SUNDAY [**2-7**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracic aorta and carotid (with cerebral) angiography,
PTA/stent x1 to left internal carotid artery.  [**2179-2-8**] by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **]


History of Present Illness:
82 yo female with history of cellulitis, CAD, diabetes who
recently presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital [**2178-1-19**] with right and
left sided tingling x 1-1.5hr. Dx as TIA. Carotid US
demonstrated critical 80-99% stenosis of the left internal
carotid artery. She declined MRI [**2-12**] claustrophobia, but head CT
was reportedly normal. As per neurology, the symptoms were
compatible with [**Doctor First Name 3098**] lesion. She was discharged to Life Center
Rehab/Nursing home where she is currently residing. She is now
referred for prehydration in preparation for a carotid angiogram
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] tomorrow. She reports having difficulty walking
due to persistence of LE weakness and spends most of her time in
a wheelchair.
.
ROS:
(+) LE swelling unchanged, R LE weakness, tingling sensation
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.


Past Medical History:
1. PAD with recently documented TIA with the carotid duplex
suggesting the critical left ICA lesion.
2. Coronary artery disease: MI [**12/2173**] with stent to LCX. Also
with AMI [**2174**] with instent restenosis in LCx, s/p restenting and
brachytherapy. Also with residual 70% ostial stenosis of LAD,
70% mid vessel stenosis of the LAD with an 80% mid vessel
stenosis of the D1, medically managed. (note: only "baseline
ECG" available predates [**2174**] in-stent restenosis and PCI)
3. Hypertension.
4. Poor mobility due to multiple factors.
5. Recurrent urinary tract infections due to chronic
catheterization.
6. Chronic leg cellulitis/bilateral.
7. Bilateral pedal edema - multifactorial.
8. CRI - baseline Cr 2.0
9. Bipolar disease
10. COPD
11. DM
12. Psoriasis
13. CHF


Social History:
Nonsmoker, nondrinker, lives independently at senior high rise,
[**Doctor Last Name **] Towers.

Family History:
Unknown.

though tangential in thought

Radiologic Data:
[**2179-1-19**] Carotid U/S:
Grossly abnormal study: On the left side there is soft
heterogeneous plaque which is irregular. It is present in the
carotid bulb and extends into the proximal left internal carotid
artery. Spectrum analysis shows markely accelerated flow
velocities and spectral broadening consistent with an 80-99%
stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. Would strongly
recommend patient undergo CT angiography or MRA.
.
On the right side there is heterogeneous calcific plaque in the
bulb which involves the right internal carotid artery. Spectrum
analysis is wnl, not suggesting any evidence of hemodynamically
significant stenosis present in the right internal carotid
artery. There is antegrade flow present in both vertebral
arteries.
.
Conclusion: Grossly abnormal study
1) Evidence of critical 80-99% stenosis of the left internal
carotid artery. Would strongly recommend further imaging studies
as described above.
2) No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis present
in the right internal carotid artery.
3) Antegrade flow present in the vertebral artery bilaterally.

Thoracic aorta and carotid angiography [**2179-2-8**]: stent to [**Doctor First Name 3098**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 82 year old female with severe carotid stenosis
and hx of recent TIA, suggesting [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3098**] lesion, who had a stent
placed in the [**Doctor First Name 3098**] with uncontrolled hypertension.
.
1) Carotid stenosis: She was admitted for pre cath hydration.
One episode of syncope 4 yrs prior to admission. Pt denies
symptoms of orthopnea, chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope
and no amaurosis fugax. She was prehydrated with bicarb and
given periprocedural n-acetylcysteine for renal protection. She
had uncomplicated placement of [**Doctor First Name 3098**] stent with residual 10%
normal flow. She was continued on aspirin and plavix post
procedure. She was notably hypertensive pre and post procedure
requiring nitroprusside gtt with goal SBP 100-150 for adequate
cerebral perfussion. Her antihypertensive regimen was increased
to hydralazine 100mg po q8, imdur 90mg po qd, lisinopril 20mg po
qd, and metoprolol 100mg po bid.
.
2) HCT drop: Following the procedure her hct decreased from
32.1-->25.8-->now 26.2. She had reported a headache/neck pain
immeadiately following the procedure but those resolved and the
decrease hct was thought to be dilutional. She had no
hypotension or tachycardia.
.
3) DM: She was maintained with ISS and had fingersticks QID.
.
4) CKD- Creatinine remained stable. Likely due to diabetic
nephropathy. She received hydration with bicarb and mucomyst for
renal protection.
.
5) Prophylaxis: PPI, sc heparin, bowel regimen
.
6) Code Status: Full
