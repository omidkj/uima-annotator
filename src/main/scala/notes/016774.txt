History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 104543**] is a 57 year-old female with a history of mixed
obstructive/restrictive lung disease, demyelinating
polyneuropathy with consequent limited mobility, and
oropharyngeal dysphagia with prior aspiration pneumonias, who
presents from the ED with hypoxemia. She was most recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (3) 104551**] for hypoxemia and asthma
exacerbation, treated with Levofloxacin, systemic steroids and
bronchodilator therapy.  She now returns with a 2-week history
of increased cough, which is largely non-productive. She also
endorses increased SOB and wheezing. + Rhinorrhea, + sore
throat, now improved. She denies chest pain, no LE pain or
swelling, no orthopnea or PND. Unclear if fever at home. She
claims that her husband and daughter had a similar constellation
of symptoms prior to the onset of her current illness. She
continues to eat, but denies any aspiration event.

In ED, initial vitals with T 100.9, HR 104, BP 90/62, RR 20, Sat
85% on RA, 92% on 2L. She was subsequently placed on a NRB, with
100% saturation. CXR with ? RLL infiltrate, improved left
retrocardiac opacity. She was given Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and
Flagyl. Plan was made to obtain a CT with contrast, and she was
given Benadryl, but this plan was aborted given her history of
IV contrast allergy. While in the ED, her BP dropped to high 70s
despite IV fluid administration, and she was started on
peripheral dopamine. She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
care.

Past Medical History:
1. Mixed obstructive/restrictive lung disease, with
long-standing asthma, multiple prior hospitalizations,
intubations. Last course of steroid in 06/[**2125**].
2. Demyelinating polyneuropathy, extensive work-up in the past,
etiology unclear.
3. Oropharyngeal dysphagia, status post PEG tube placement.
4. Hypothyroidism
5. PUD, last EGD [**6-/2123**] with gastritis and few shallow
pre-pyloric ulcers.
6. Dilated pancreatic ducts status post sphincterotomy
7. Osteoporosis
8. Hypothyroidism
9. Hypercholesterolemia
10. Depression/anxiety
11. Status post appendectomy and cholecystectomy

[**8-28**] EKG: Sinus rhythm, rate 70. Since the previous tracing of
[**2126-7-9**] no significant changes are seen.

Radiology
[**8-26**] CXR: Comparison to [**2126-7-8**]. The heart size is normal,
and the mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The
left lung base is not well evaluated due to rotation and
positioning. The left retrocardiac opacity, however, is somewhat
improved. There is a new small focus of right lower lobe
opacity. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.

[**8-27**] CXR: Opacification at the left lung base is more
pronounced. This could be new atelectasis or pneumonia, but
there is also an increase in small bilateral pleural effusion
and development of mild edema at the right lung base. Heart is
normal size. No pneumothorax.

[**8-28**] CXR: Mild pulmonary edema which progressed on [**8-27**]
is stable. Left lower lobe consolidation which developed
yesterday has improved but less severe opacification at the
right lung base has not. These could represent areas of
dependent edema and atelectasis but raise concern for recent
aspiration. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable. Heart
is normal in size and there is no mediastinal venous
engorgement. No pneumothorax


Brief Hospital Course:
57 year old female with recurrent aspiration, asthma,
neuromuscular disease presents with cough and hypotension, found
to have an aspiration pneumonia and asthma exacerbation

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ICU, she was given fluid boluses and weaned off pressors.
She was continued on levofloxacin for multifocal PNA, as well as
steroids and nebs for asthma exacerbation, and was  98% on 5L NC
on transfer to the floor [**2126-8-29**].

1) Asthma exacerbation: Most likely triggered by viral process
(recent ill contacts, upper respiratory tract symptoms) and
aspiration. The patient clinically improved on high dose
prednisone, and will complete a gradual taper as an outpateint.
She was continued on Advair and albuterol per her home regimen.

2) Aspiration pneumonia: The patient improved on antibiotics
with chest physical therapy, and will complete a 14 day course
of levofloxacin and metronidazole. She has a long history of
dysphagia (she is s/p PEG tube placement) and aspiration, and
she reports that she was taking pureed solids and thickened
liquids until 2 years ago, when she decided that she would
resume a regular diet for quality of life reasons. This decision
was discussed at length with her, given multiple admissions for
aspiration pneumonia. She expressed understanding that, given
her underlying lung disease and current multifocal aspiration
pneumonia, additional aspiration would likely be life
threatening. She expressed understanding of and acceptance of
the risk of aspiration (death, intubation). She was advised to
maintain aspiration precautions at all times. At time of
discharge, her O2 sat was 93-95% on 3L NC, and she will have
home oxygen at home.

3) Hypothyroidism: The patient was continued on her home dose of
levothyroxine. While in the ICU, her TSH was mildly suppressed
at 0.19. This should be rechecked as an outpatient once she
recovers from her acute illness.

4) Anemia: At discharge, HCT 37. Iron studies were not
consistent with iron deficiency, and vitamin B12/folate were
within normal limits. SPEP showed hypogammoglobulinemia, stable
from prior.

5) Neuromuscular disease: The patient was continued on her
outpatient doses of Baclofen and clonazepam. At time of
discharge, she felt that she was at her baseline in terms of
transfer (wheelchair-bound at baseline) and declined home PT or
VNA.

6) Depression: The patient was continued on her home doses of
buspirone.

7) Osteoporosis: The patient was continued on calcium and
Vitamin D.

8) Full Code: This was discussed at length with patient, who
stated that she would want to be intubated/resuscitated, but was
opposed to long-term ventilatory support. She has discussed this
issue with her health care proxy.
