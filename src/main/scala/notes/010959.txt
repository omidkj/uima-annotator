History of Present Illness:
26 yo woman with history of concentric sclerosis (see below) and
depression who was noted to have a right facial droop of the eye
and mouth with dysarthric speech 3-4 weeks ago.  She presented
to
an OSH ED at that time where a CT head was negative, and was
given the diagnosis of Bell's palsy.  She was started on a
steroid taper over the following 2 weeks with some improvement
of
her droop.  Her mother reports that the patient stated her right
hand felt "funny", perhaps numb or tingling, the day after
completing the taper.  She was subsequently instructed to resume
the steroids at a "higher" dose last weekend.  After resuming
the
steroids, her boyfriend noticed that she seemed to be having
weakness of her right upper extremity/hand while trying to feed
herself.  The patient became frustrated and threw her food.  She
was normally mild- mannered, and was becoming increasing
physical
and violent over the following days.  Her aunt noticed last
[**Name (NI) 1017**] that her speech was not only dysarthric, but that she was
having difficulty expressing her thoughts.  Last Monday, she
returned to the ED, due to her behavioral changes, and was
diagnosed with a steroid-induced psychosis.  In addition to the
recommendation of stopping steroids, a family PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2875**] 5
mg
Zyprexa, which made her extremely sleepy (slept 18 hours).  Her
dose was reduced for Tuesday and Wednesday to 2.5 mg each day,
and she seemed less angry and less sleepy.  However, she was
still far from her baseline behavior, and the medication was
subsequently discontinued.  She has declined more rapidly since
yesterday, when she had further feeding difficulties, raising he
right arm to her chest level with the spoon, but unable to bring
it any further to her mouth.  She was actually aiming her head
at
the spoon, but seemed to be missing it to the sides.  Her gait
was unsteady, and her mother described [**Name2 (NI) 78167**] movements.
She went to the [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital ED last evening, where a CT of
the head was reportedly negative for acute changes.  After
speaking to her local neurologist, her parents were advised to
contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who had seen her previously during her stay
at
[**Hospital1 2025**] for concentric sclerosis (see below).  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended
she come to [**Hospital1 18**] to be evaluated in the morning.  last night,
her mother noted right lower extremity jerking q 2-3 seconds
that
persisted on and off through the night from 12 am to 4 am.  On a
similar note her mother noted diffuse body "shivers" during the
week.  Finally, her mother (a nurse) noted intermittent
bilateral
upper extremity movements that appeared to similar to
decorticate
posturing during the week.

Past Medical History:
-Concentric sclerosis: Per report, occurred at age 15 years.
The
patient presented to [**Hospital1 2025**] after experiencing right leg weakness
and incontinence.  She was apparently treated with steroids over
a [**5-9**] weak course after a one-week admission.  However, by the
end of the steroid taper, she had worsened and developed
quadriparesis.  She returned for a one-month admission, at which
time she saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was started on a chemotherapeutic
(possibly Cytoxan).  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], there was a dumbell-shaped
bifrontal lesion.  She gradually gained strength in an ascending
fashion up her legs, then up her arms.  She was ultimately
discharged to rehabilitation, and had returned to "95%" of her
baseline prior to the illness, which may have been post-viral in
nature.  She states that her speech never fully recovered (in
her
mind, tends to speak too quickly), and that there were bouts of
right-sided weakness precipitated by heat.  She loses her
balance
a bit more easily.  She was followed by neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at
[**Hospital 8641**] Hospital for some time, but has not followed with him in
years, as her interval since she has been stable.  The were no
reported intervals of regression or decline.
-Depression, since the onset of the above illness
-s/p tonsillectomy
