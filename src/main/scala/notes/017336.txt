Mr. [**Known lastname 49985**] is a 29 year old man with h/o Type I DM, 10 prior
admissions for DKA since [**1-4**], who presents with SOB/chest
discomfort, found to be in DKA.

The patient was at work today when he started feeling dyspnea on
exertion and substernal chest discomfort. CP worsened with deep
breaths. No difference with change in position. FS at that time
was 491, so the patient gave himself Humalog 7units. Repeat FS
369. He drove himself to the ED for further evaluation.

Of note, the patient was just admitted to [**Hospital3 25357**] 4 days prior in DKA, symptoms of N/V, discharged the
following day without any changes to his prior regimen. He had
been on insulin pump in the past, but was discontinued in [**1-4**].
Just restarted on insulin pump 10 days prior to this admission -
basal rate 0.75units/hr with bolus dosing at mealtime. Follows
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 49986**] as an outpatient, last seen on [**2107-11-4**] and
started on insulin pump at that time.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.4 100 112/72 15 100% RA. Chest
discomfort resolved on arrival to the ED. Initial FS was >500,
with anion gap of 22, urine ketones 150. Patient was given IVF -
2LNS, 1L IVF with K, and started on 1L D5NS; started on insulin
gtt. Repeat lytes showed improved gap from 22 -> 18.

On the floor, the patient is currently comfortable. Only
complaint is that he is hungry. No fevers, chills, cough, sore
throat, N/V, abdominal pain, dysuria. SOB and CP are still
resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 49985**] is a 29 year old man with h/o DM1, frequent
hospitalizations for DKA, recently restarted on insulin pump,
who was admitted in DKA.
.
#. DKA: Patient admitted for the 11th time this year with DKA.
Recently started on insulin pump, now with his second admission
in 10 days; insulin dosing did not appear to be adequate. No
signs or symptoms of infection as a trigger at this time, though
patient later had a persistent cough that was treated with
azithromycin.
On admission, patient was put on a regular insulin drip, and
started on D5 1/2NS when glucose came down <200. The next
morning, he was restarted on his insulin pump at a higher basal
dose.
The second day of admission, there was some confusion on two
levels. The patient misunderstood the calorie counts in the menu
and gave himself very low amounts of insulin based on his
calorie counting scale. His glucose meter was also poorly
calibrated and was giving finger stick readings about 150 lower
than actual. He was hyperglycemic to the 400s, but did not have
recurrent acidosis. His glucose levels subsequently improved.
The next day we spoke with his outpatient endocrinologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 49986**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 49987**]), who said that he had only met the
patient once. He has few insulin pump patients, so the decision
was to have the patient return to [**Last Name (un) **] for further follow-up.
He will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 978**] the day after discharge to re-establish
care with him.
.
#. Cough: Patient had a productive cough. CXR negative. The
decision was made to treat him with azithromycin for a suspected
upper-respiratory tract infection.
.
#. ARF: Patient with Cr 1.3 on admission, baseline Cr 1.0.
Improved with fluid resuscitation.
