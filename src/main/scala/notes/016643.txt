Physical Exam:
admission:
68" 85kg
128/77 lt arm pulse reg at 64 RR 16  RA O2 99%
4/6 SEM precordium to neck
Cor-RSR
Ext: no CCE. 2+ pulses

Pertinent Results:
[**2151-6-9**] Intraop TEE:
Pre-bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 45 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward
the anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets are
myxomatous. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric
nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Post-bypass: The patient is not receiving inotropic support
post-CPB. There is a well-seated mitral annuloplasty ring. There
is no mitral regurgitation. There is a transvalvular mean
gradient of 3 mm Hg at a cardiac output of 5.8 L/min.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved and all findings
are consistent with pre-bypass findings. The aorta is intact
post-decannulation. All findings were discussed with the surgeon
intraoperatively.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2151-6-9**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed a mitral valve repair and
closure of a patent foramen ovale.  See operative note for
details. Following surgery, he was transferred to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and extubated without incident. Chest tubes were removed
per protocol and low dose beta blockade was initiated. He went
on to develop complete heart block, requiring temporary pacing.
Beta blockade was subsequently stopped. EP service was consulted
and attributed AV block to AV nodal edema. His rhythm was
observed for several days and his AV block resolved. He went on
to develop first degree AV block with conversion to persistent
atrial fibrillation/flutter. He remained asymptomatic and pacing
wires were eventually removed on postoperative day nine.
Warfarin was eventually started and dosed for a goal INR between
2.0 and 3.0. All nodal agents continued to be withheld and EP
service felt pacemaker was not indicated at this time. Mr.
[**Known lastname 14893**] will followup with EP/cardiology as an outpatient. At
time of discharge, INR was subtherapeutic but will be followed
closely by [**Hospital1 **] Cardiology Clinic. The remainder of
his postoperative course was routine and he was cleared for
discharge to home on postoperative day nine.
