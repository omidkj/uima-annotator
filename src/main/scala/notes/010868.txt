Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the thoracic surgery service on [**2135-4-7**] and on the day of admission the patient had a CT scan of
the chest that revealed several right sided apical blebs and an
imcompletely inflated right lung.  Thus decision was made at
this time to take the patient to the operating room.  On [**2135-4-8**] the patient underwent flexible bronchoscopy, right
thoracoscopy with apical bleb resection, and mechanical
pleurodesis.  The patient tolerated the procedures very well and
was transferred to the hospital [**Hospital1 **] after a brief stint in the
recovery room.  Postoperatively the patient did have some fevers
and was cultured and found to have growth of staphylococcus
aureus in the blood that was sensitive to oxacillin.  He was
then started on antibiotics which was converted to vancomycin
and levofloxacin prior on [**4-13**] and [**4-11**] respectively.  He also
underwent doppler studies of the legs to assess for venous
thrombosis as part of the fever workup and these were negative.
By the time of discharge he was afebrile and feeling
significantly better with plans to continue the antibiotics
through [**5-8**].
