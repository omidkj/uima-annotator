Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain and UTI


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
In [**Month (only) 958**] the patient underwent sigmoid colectomy w/end colostomy
for malrotation & megacolon limited to the rectosigmoid in a
combined procedure with OB/Gyn performing a TAH/RSO for pelvic
abscess. She recovered from that operation and was doing well
until she presented last month with a small bowel obstruction
neccesitating extensive adhesiolysis, enterectomy and completion
subtotal colectomy with an end ileostomy on [**2201-6-11**] with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 468**]. She recovered and was seen in clinic Monday appearing
healthy, vibrant and eating well. This morning ~8am she was
noted to be much more "fussy" according to her mother and
appeared to be distressed about some lower abdominal pain.
Although she was tolerating oral intake, it was felt to be
somewhat diminished.  She was not experiencing any fevers,
nausea or vomiting, however.  Of note, her ostomy output was not
significantly diminished (albeit somewhat thin) and had copious
gas in her appliance.

AXR: mildly dilated small bowel with scant air-fluid levels

[**7-16**] CXR Limited, but no acute cardiopulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Recurrent Aspiration complicated by Aspiration PNA:
The patient required 3L O2 via NC in the AM of HD2 and was
slowly weaned off to RA.  Then around noon of HD 2 on [**7-17**], she
developed hypoxemia to the 70's and was triggered.  ECG showed
sinus tachycardia, CXR showed some fluid, and ABG showed
hypoxemia.  The patient was placed on 100% NRB and given 20IV
lasix.  The patient responded well and started to saturate in
the low 90's on NRB.  The patient was then given digoxin IV and
another dose of lasix with minimal response.  She continued to
decompensate and was transferred to the SICU.  She was intubated
for hypoxic respiratory failure and started on Vanco/Zosyn IV.
A bronchoscopy and BAL was performed while she was intubated
which showed growth of oropharnygeal flora as well as a right
lower lobe opacification and mucous plugging of the right main
stem
bronchus suggesting post-obstructive pneumonia.  Given no growth
of MRSA or hx of such, she was mainatined on a 10day course of
IV Zosyn for this aspiration PNA which was completed during her
hospitalization.  She continued to require supplemental oxygen
following this slowly resolving aspiration event and was
discharged home with home o2.

2) Abdominal Pain
Initially admitted to the surgical service with abdominal pain
and concern for a partial SBO on imaging.  She continued to have
good ostomy output and she was managed conservatively.  Her
abdominal pain resolved and at discharge she continued to have
good ostomy output.

3) UTI:
On admission to the surgical service, had dirty U/A that was
treated with 3 days of PO cipro (no culture sent).  Her sx's
resolved and subsequent U/As were negative.

4) FEN/aspiration risk:
Pt known to have constant aspiration risk.  She is well known to
the S&S eval team here at [**Hospital1 18**].  A repeat S&S eval showed risk
of aspiration for all consistencies.  She was kept NPO and
mainatined on TFs through an NGT during her stay.  A discussion
regarding the results of her S&S eval was had with her HCP
mother who emphasized that she is careful about having her sit
upright at all times while eating at home and that she has not
had an episode of aspiration at home and rather felt that her
aspiration events while hospitalized were in the setting of her
acute illness.  A family meeting during her hospitalization was
held with attending Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], speech/swallow team, and
case management.  A full discussion regarding her risks of
aspiration were discussed as well as the option of having a PEG
placed for enteral nutrition.  Her mother [**Name (NI) 382**] did not want PEG
tube placement at this time, but did state that if she developed
aspiration events at home she will consider this in the future.
She was maintained on a pureed diet with thickened liquids under
strict supervision by the RNs along with always sitting straight
upright to prevent aspiration.  The speech/swallow team had
multiple teaching sessions with the parents to attempt to
minimize aspiration.  She should consider bringing her back for
outpatient video S&S again in 3 months when she is healthy to
assess her swallow function when she is home and healthy.

5) ARF:
Developed acute renal failure while hospitalized, felt due to
temporary hypoxia and ATN while being intubated along with
contrast nephropathy.  A workup including urine eos to exclude
AIN and renal U/S to exclude hydronephrosis was performed and
negative. Her Cr trended back down to normal range and on day of
discharge her Cr had normalized.

6) CHF:
Known underlying cardiomyopathy, EF 35%.  Takes Lasix at home
but due to her NPO status through much of her stay and
anticipated difficulty maintaining hydration at home, lasix has
been held.  Discussed with pt's family, recommend re-evaluation
as an outpt to determine when and if lasix should be restarted.
