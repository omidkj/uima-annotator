Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
88-year-old woman with severe COPD recently admitted for COPD
flare from [**2103-2-19**] to [**2103-2-23**].  She was sent to [**Hospital1 **]
where she was at rehabilitation for two weeks and then went
home for two days.  She was noted by her family to feel weak,
poor appetite.  The family was unable to care for the
patient.  The patient decreased p.o. intake and was more
lethargic and somnolent on presentation.

In the ER, the patient denied shortness of breath, fever,
cough, nausea, vomiting, or chest pain or urinary or bowel
symptoms.  In the ER, the patient was noted to be
hyponatremic, sodium 129, and dehydrated.  When the patient
was seen on the floor, she was noted to be short of breath,
breathing with pursed lips using the sternocleidomastoid
muscles, and head bobbing.  Her initial blood gas was 7.28,
92, 72, 46, 13.  Repeat ABG was 7.36, 79, 150.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with family
members.  She has five children.  Twenty-pack smoking
history, although her family members do [**Name2 (NI) **].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for lung cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  When the author picked up the patient
from night float, the examination was the following.  On
three liters 91%, breathing at 35, head bobbing, pursed lips,
seizing sternocleidomastoids, pulse 90-100, blood pressure
110/60.  The patient was in no acute distress but was
confused and decreased alertness.  HEENT:  Dry mucous
membranes.  EOMI.  PERRLA.  No JVD.  Neck:  The neck was
supple.  Pulmonary:  Diffuse dry crackles bilaterally.  No
evidence of consolidation on percussion.  The crackles were
greatest at the bases.  Cardiovascular:  S1, S2, regular rate
and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Obese,
soft, normoactive bowel sounds.  No spinal tenderness.
Neurological:  The patient was A&O times one.  Cranial nerves
II through XII were grossly intact. The patient was
somnolent.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema, [**3-11**]
peripheral pulses.

LABORATORY DATA UPON PRESENTATION:  White count 6, hemoglobin
10, hematocrit 33, platelets 370,000, MCV 87.  Sodium 130,
potassium 3.7, chloride 86, bicarbonate 37, BUN 12,
creatinine 0.3, magnesium 1.9, calcium 7.8.  Iron 19, TIBC
273, phosphorus 3.

ASSESSMENT:  The patient was initially seen in the Emergency
Department.  She was thought to be dehydrated.  She was given
1 liter of normal saline when the night shift admitted her.
The respiratory rate increased.  Her mental status decreased.
The ABGs as stated earlier, two ABGs were performed, first
one 7.28, 92, 72.  The next one that was performed was 7.36,
79, 150, her oxygen was decreased to 2 liters nasal cannula.
She had been on 5 liters nasal cannula as the patient has
chronic retention, it may have been contributing to her
somnolence.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 88-year-old woman with severe
end-stage COPD complicated by SIADH who presents with COPD
flare demonstrated by increased respiratory rate and
decreased mental status and an increased effort in breathing.
However, the patient on chest x-ray, had no focal
consolidation or evidence of CHF.  She was afebrile with a
normal white count.  There was no obvious source that tipped
her over to have her COPD exacerbation.  It was felt that
possibly the taper of her steroids resulted in the flare-up
and she has severe disease.

1.  PULMONARY/COPD:  The patient was placed on a
methylprednisolone drip at 100 mg IV q. eight.  As the
patient's respiratory status improved, she was converted to
prednisone which is being tapered over two weeks.  At the
date of discharge, she will be on 50 mg p.o. q.d.  The
patient was given Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q. four
hours; however, on examination, there was no evidence of
wheezing and the patient did not report any symptomatic
relief from the nebulizers.  In fact, it seemed to be
corresponding with the onset of the action steroids in which
the patient began to improve.

The patient was placed empirically on Bactrim Double-Strength
p.o. b.i.d.  The patient showed signs of increased signs of
hypercarbia and C02 retention with higher degrees of oxygen
saturation.  In fact, she had one gas which revealed a pH of
7.25, PC02 107, P02 121 when her oxygen was turned up too
high.  With lowering oxygen to keep her saturations at a goal
between 88 and 92%, the patient's natural respiratory drive
took over and she was able to return to her normal baseline
gas which is approximately a pH around 7.35 with a PC02 in
the high 50s to low 60s.

The patient spent a night in the MICU in [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] without
intubation, without BIPAP, and was transferred back to the
floor after the 24-hour stay.  In general, the patient was
also given inhaled long-acting beta agonists and inhaled
Combivent, and long-acting steroids.

In general, her course respiratory wise is one of
improvement.  The patient's mental status, after being
somnolent, improved to be more alert and less hypercarbic and
her respiratory stress eased to where she was comfortable
sitting up in a chair and working with Physical Therapy.

2.  NEUROLOGY:  The Neurology Service was consulted when she
became somnolent.  They felt that it was toxic metabolic as
the patient at that time had demonstration of asterixis.  Her
electrolytes were within normal limits with the exception of
her sodium which was near her baseline at the time,
approximately 128-130.  It was felt that the hypercarbia was
contributing to her change in mental status and when this was
improved her mental status also improved.

She was not imaged and a lumbar puncture was not performed.
This was based on the Neurology recommendation.  However, the
patient did receive an EEG which showed some left temporal
slowing.  It did not show any epileptiform changes and the
recommendations of the Neurology Team were that her Dilantin
will be tapered off.  She had initially been on 100 mg p.o.
t.i.d.  This will be decreased to 100 p.o. b.i.d. and then
100 q.h.s. and then off.  It was felt that the patient's
seizure activity was due to hyponatremia and as long as her
sodium is controlled she does not have an inherent seizure
disorder.

3.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
dehydrated when she first presented.  She received normal
saline.  Her sodium was near baseline when she presented on
[**2103-3-7**].  The patient in her stay became more dehydrated and
having decreased p.o. intake when she was somnolent and
hyperventilating.  This was corrected with normal saline.
Her sodium came up from a low of 120 up to 126.  However,
then as she began to get more volume she became more
hyponatremic, preferentially retaining free water.  The
patient was switched to hypertonic saline at 500 cc given
slowly over 16 hours of roughly 30 cc an hour.  The patient's
sodium climbed from 120-124 on the day prior to discharge.
It was rechecked in the evening prior to discharge and it was
at 122.  The patient was once again started on a similar
amount of hypertonic saline.

The patient's potassium was 5.7.  On the night prior to
discharge, she received 30 grams of p.o. Kayexalate.  These
two electrolytes will be monitored on the day of discharge
and adjus
