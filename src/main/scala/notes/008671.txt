Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
56yoM with h/o end stage aggressive nasopharyngeal ca involving
skull and carotid s/p embolization and carotid stenting in
[**4-/2184**] who presented with ~1500cc's of bright red hemoptysis to
[**Hospital1 392**] and was intubated at 330pm (difficult intubation). He
received 1u PRBC's and was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED initial vitals: 98.2  110/70  84  18  100% NRB. NSurg,
ENT, and Dr. [**Name (NI) **] (pt's oncologist) discussed the case and
it was felt that no procedure or chemotherapy would be
appropriate, and recommended admit for end of life care. This
was discussed with the pt's family and they decided to support
the pt until his wife could come from [**State 4260**]. Pts was started on
Propofol gtt, 1L IVF's, and 2mg IV Ativan.
.
Pt was admitted in [**4-/2184**] with epistaxis then hemoptysis vs
hematemsis. He went to OSH and was transfused and sent to [**Hospital1 **]. He
decompensated in the ED with desaturations and was intubated. He
was found to have carotid perforation and had a distal right
internal carotid stent by IR. He was transfused 8u PRBC's. It
was thought that tumor was eroding into the artery. He was
treated for aspiration PNA with 8d Unasyn. He was aspirating but
pt allowed to eat small amts. He was noted to have small
ischemic infarcts, and had RUE DVT's, treated conservatively
without anticoagulation given risk of hemorrhage. He was
hypotense and received blood, IVF's, platelets.

STUDIES:
# CXR [**2184-6-1**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. ET tube in appropriate position.
2. Patchy consolidation at the right lung base with obscuration
of the right heart border; differential includes infection
versus aspiration versus hemorrhage in the right middle lobe.

# [**6-3**] portable abdomen
FINDINGS: These radiographs are slightly limited by patient
motion. Air andstool are seen throughout a nondistended colon.
There is air within the
rectum. There is no evidence of obstruction or ileus. No free
air is seen inthe abdomen. Patchy opacities within the lungs are
concerning for infection.  A continuous diaphragm sign is noted,
most consistent with pneumomediastinum.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of obstruction or ileus.
2. Evidence suggestive of pneumomediastinum.
3. Heterogeneous opacities within the lungs are concerning for
infection.
Please refer to the accompanying chest radiograph from [**2184-6-3**] for
additional details.

# [**6-3**] portal CXR
Pneumomediastinum was present, but smaller on [**6-1**],
progressed to increased mediastinal air and subcutaneous
emphysema in the neck on [**6-3**], without subsequent change over
five hours. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural
effusion. Probable right lower lobe pneumonia is improving, due
in part to increased lung volumes generally. There is no
appreciable pleural effusion. ET tube, right subclavian infusion
port are in standard placements.
Nasogastric tube should be advanced 6 cm to move all the side
ports into the stomach.

# [**6-4**] portal CXR
Lung volumes are decreased slightly. This accounts for greater
prominence to right lower lobe consolidation, probably unchanged
over the past 24 hours, and improved since [**6-1**]. There is a
suggestion of a new, possibly cavitated nodule in the left mid
lung at the level of the fourth anterior interspace and possibly
one or two similar sized lesion at the same level on the right.
Consideration should be given to septic emboli.

Pneumomediastinum is stable or improved. There is less
subcutaneous emphysema today in the neck. ET tube and right
subclavian infusion port are in standard placements. Nasogastric
tube would need to be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports
into the stomach. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal vascular
engorgement reflects supine positioning.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after

be
         warranted.
