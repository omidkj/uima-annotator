History of Present Illness:
70 y/o male with PMHx significant for recent MCA stroke, CHF
(LVEF 15%) who was initially at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2141-1-12**] for MCA
stroke. Patient during that admission developed MRSA PNA and
sent to [**Hospital **] rehab for completion of antibiotics. At [**Hospital1 **]
got nosocomial PNA initially treated with vanc/zosyn as well as
developed CHF exacerbation. He was intubated and then extubated
for 72 hours and then needed to be re-intubated for hypoxic
respiratory failure. He was extubated again and then reintubated
after failing bipap for 24-48 hours. He was noted to have a
persistant WBC count and underwent CXR which showed increased R
pleural effusion. A thoracentesis was done which drained 600cc
of exudative fluid that was cloudy (LDH 1200 and glucose 5). A
chest tube was placed which drained approximately 2L and grew E.
Coli from his sputum and chest tube drainage. At that time he
was switched from zosyn to aztreonam based on sensitivities. His
WBC count decreased and his clinical condition improved so he
underwent another trail of extubation on [**4-24**]. He started to
decompensate 24 hours later felt to be in heart failure so given
Bipap and maxamized cardiac meds. He continue to fail and was
re-intubated on [**4-26**] felt to be because patient too weak and
unable to clear secreations. After discussion with patient's
sister decision made to have patient undergo trach and PEG so
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Pertinent Results:
[**4-27**] chest ct:
IMPRESSION:
1. Improvement of right lower lobe pneumonia with persistent
moderate right hydropneumothorax.
2. Enlarged small left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
3. Stable cardiomegaly.
4. Anasarca.
.
[**4-29**] cxr:
Comparison made to prior study of [**2141-4-28**], at 11:04 a.m.
Persistent loculated right pneumothorax is unchanged. The
location of the two chest tubes are unchanged, one with its side
port projecting over the right lower lung fields, and the second
with its sidehole projecting over the right upper to mid lung
field. The extreme left costophrenic angle has been excluded
from the study. Left basilar atelectasis is unchanged.
Atelectasis at the right lung base is unchanged.
.
IMPRESSION: Loculated hydropneumothorax on the right is
unchanged.
.
CXR [**4-30**]:
FINDINGS: Markedly stable examination demonstrating a loculated
hydropneumothorax at the right lung base with an indwelling
apically directed chest tube. Again seen is massive
cardiomegaly. The left costophrenic angle has been excluded on
this radiograph and demonstrates a small effusion. Tracheostomy
in stable position.

IMPRESSION: Markedly stable examination.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o male with PMHx significant for MCA stroke who presents
from [**Hospital1 **] with R pleural effusion s/p chest tube placement
who has failed multiple extubation transferred here for trach
and PEG.
.
## Respiratory Failure: Patient with exudative plerual effusion
that was growing E. coli. Recent CXR raises question of
necrotizing pna and possible PTX. The patient has a chest tube
in place and had a ct to further assess. Based on CT patient
with hydropneumothorax. He had a new chest tube placed, and with
2 tubes now will possibly help reexpand the lung. Given initial
concern for abscess clindamycin used, but stopped on [**4-29**], and
only aztreonam used. would cont aztreonam at least for 4-6 weeks
days, until [**5-28**] or longer per IP. Pt weaned off vent on [**4-29**] to
trach mask. Chest tubes to be kept in place and managed for
empyema; length and suction management per IP. He is s/p trach
and PEG on [**4-28**]. Cont IH/nebs as needed. Chest tubes can be
d/c'd once each one has <100 cc of output per 24 hours. Also,
tomorrow tpa could be applied to each chest tube to see if this
increases output.
.
## CHF: Patient did not appear to be in failure at admission. He
has a known LVEF of 15%.  BB, imdur, hydralizine, and digoxin
were continued. Lasix used prn to keep volume even to -500cc. Cr
slightly elevated on d/c (1.^) so withheld adding ACEI; please
recheck at rehab and consider adding ACEI and stopping
hydralizine if this returns to his baseline.
.
## C. diff colitis: Patient with large quantity of loose stool.
Reported C. diff colitis at [**Hospital1 **], although C diff negative
here. Will cont PO flagyl until one week after last abx dose.
Can use 500 mg PO tid via PEG.
.
## H/O ischemic stroke: Per recent d/c summary patient was to
get repeat CT head and if no evidence of intracranial bleed then
start anticoagualtion; however patient also with history of GI
bleed with
