History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with past medical history
significant for HTN, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery
disease, atrial fibrillation, premature atrial tachycardia, CHF,
anxiety/depression and prior squamous cell cancer of the anus
(s/p resection, chemotherapy and radiation -[**2151**])who presents
now as a transfer from [**Hospital6 17032**] with CBC
and differential concerning for acute leukemia. The patient went
to PCP earlier this week with main complaint of left thigh
cellulitis. The patient was sent to ED after CBC labs were
markedly abnormal. ED labs on [**2157-3-11**] showed a marked
leukocytosis to 45.7, platelet count of 15, Hct 26.8, Hgb 9, MCV
93.7. Manual differential showed 34% blasts, 5% promyelocytes,
12% myelocytes, 14% metamyelocytes, 14% bands, 14% neutrophils,
1% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 2% eosinophils, 7% nucleated RBCs.

.
At OSH a hematology/oncology consult was called and team felt
his presentation was that of possible CML with blast crisis
given increased blasts on differential. He was given 1 Unit of
irradiated platelets and platelets rose from 15 to 26. He also
received Hydrea 500mg x 2 doses. No blood transfusions. He was
started on allopurinol 100mg Po tid. DIC panel showed INR 1.5,
fibrinogen 347.8, d-dimer 1422. He had no fever spikes
throughout his brief course at OSH and blood cultures were
negative to date at transfer time.
.
In terms of his left thigh sores, Mr. [**Known lastname 68754**] explains that he
went to his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 3 days ago complaining of left thigh
"painful boils and redness" that had developed slowly over about
1.5 weeks. He
was placed on PO Keflex for a few days. Then at ED, infectious
disease team was consulted at OSH and placed him on IV
Vancomycin and IV Ancef which he has been getting for last day
leading up to his transfer.
.
Oncologic history is significant for prior squamous cell cancer
of the anus that was resected and treated with 5-FU and
mitomycin with radiation. His treatment ended on [**2151-12-2**]. Staging T2NOMO. Per OSH records, the patient had been in
[**4-/2156**] for a routine visit with his cardiologist and labs at
that time (for comparison) showed WBC 4.5 with 62% neutrophils,
1% bands, 11% atypical lymph cells, 17% monocytes, and platelets
of 149. Also of note, he explains having been exposed to
multiple chemicals and fumes while he worked in autobody
business for many years.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] BMT Unit his vitals were: temp 98F, BP
116/80, HR 83, RR 20, O2 Sat 94% RA. He appeared to be in no
apparent distress. He complained of some diarrhea he had been
having x 4 days since starting antibiotics.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, the patient is a 79-year-old male with PMH
significant for HTN, CHF, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation,
prior squamous cell cancer of anus (s/p resection, chemotherapy
and radiation in [**2151**]) and 1 week history of left thigh
cellulitis who presented with atypical WBCs, thrombocytopenia
and anemia concerning for acute leukemia.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] BMT Unit his vitals were: temp 98F, BP
116/80, HR 83, RR 20, O2 Sat 94% RA. He appeared to be in no
apparent distress. He complained of some diarrhea he had been
having x 4 days since starting antibiotics.  The patient's stool
was positive for C. difficile toxin, and he was started on PO
vanco and flagyl.
.
On the morning of [**3-21**] the patient developed some "burning"
sensations at his epigastric region which were initially thought
to be heartburn. He was given Maalox which offered limited
relief. Upright and supine plain abdominal films were ordered
STAT and revealed evidence of free air. A surgery consult was
called and he had a CT of the abdomen ordered. Physical exam
worsened and he had diffuse lower abdominal tenderness,
decreased bowel sounds, and some rebound tenderness as well. CT
showed new fr
