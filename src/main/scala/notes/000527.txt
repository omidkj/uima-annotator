CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2201-5-26**] 6:03 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: r/o ICH

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman with lethargy, AMS
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ICH
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: kidney disease, not needed

INDICATION: 58-year-old female with lethargy and altered mental
status. Rule out intracranial hemorrhage.

No comparison studies.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT of the head.

FINDINGS: There is linear hyperdensity within the nondependent
portions of the choroid plexus likely calcified choroid.
Posterior to the mid brain and anterior to the cerebellum, there
is linear hyperdensity which is not in a characteristic location
for hemorrhage, likely a benign structure, correlation with MRI
of the head is recommended if clinically warranted. There is no
mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or acute
major vascular territorial infarction. The ventricles are normal
in size and symmetric.

The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
clear.

IMPRESSION: No definite intracranial hemorrhage.
=================================================
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2201-5-26**] 5:43 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o acute process

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman with somnolence
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o acute process
INDICATION: 58-year-old female with somnolence. Rule out acute
process.

No comparison study.

PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Lung volumes are low. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There is
increased interstitial opacity diffusely with prominent hila
bilaterally. There are no appreciable effusions.

IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes. Likely mild pulmonary edema. If
there is further concern, repeat evaluation with better
inspiration is suggested.

ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  [**2201-5-27**] 2:14 PM

ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)

Reason: CIRRHOSIS. EVAL FOR ASCITES. FEVER

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman with h/o DM, cirrhosis a/w fever, lethargy.
Please evaluate for cirrhosis, ascites.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evalute for ascites, cirrhosis.
INDICATION: Assess for ascites and cirrhosis.

COMPARISON: None available.

ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**]
images were obtained and demonstrate the liver to be of
coarsened echotexture without ascites. No focal hepatic lesions
are demonstrated in this study limited by patient factors. The
gallbladder is nondistended. There is no pericholecystic fluid,
no evidence for cholelithiasis and the common bile duct is
nondistended measuring 5 mm. Portal venous flow is normal in
terms of direction. The left kidney measures 10.4 cm
pole-to-pole and the right kidney 10.1 and there is no evidence
for hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass. The spleen
is homogenous in terms of echotexture and measures 4.3 cm.

IMPRESSION:
1. Coarsened echotexture of liver consistent with fatty liver.
2. No ascites.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
