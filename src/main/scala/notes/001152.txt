History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 yo M with treatment refractory ITP on
long-term high dose steroids s/p lap splenectomy on [**2149-12-24**],
discharged to home on [**2149-12-28**]. The next day, his visiting nurse
noted that he was unable to rise from the couch. He presented to
[**Hospital3 **] ED and was diagnosed with steroid induced
myopathy and discharged to a rehab facility. At that rehab, he
had a KUB showing an ileus. He then represented to [**Hospital3 **] last night with marked abdominal distention. Repeat
imaging at that time showed free air on CXR and he had a CT
which
showed a large amount of free air, small fluid collection in
LLQ,
marked bowel distention ? SBO vs ileus, and RLL PNA. He was
started on vanc/cipro/flagyl and a surgery consult was obtained.
The surgeons at the outside hospital recommended transfer back
to
[**Hospital1 18**] for management under the patient's recent surgeon at
[**Hospital1 18**],
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 80 Y M  with ITP on steroids who had un uncomplicated
lap splenectomy on [**12-24**] who was readmitted on [**12-28**] to OSH for
what was thought to be steroid induced myopathy. Readmitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-2**] from OSH for abd distention. Imaging at that time
showed free air on CXR and he had a CT which showed a large
amount of free air, small fluid collection in LLQ, Treated for
diverticulitis with bowel rest and NPO.  Pt was transfered to
the TICU for resp distress, and subsequent B/L aspergillus PNA,
VRE, ATN and acute renal failure, possible PE, most recently a
retroperitoneal hematoma.
.
Events:
.
[**12-24**] readmitted with diverticulitis,
[**1-8**] CTA chest: No PE. likely a predominantly right upper lobe
pneumonia, CXR: the pre-existing right upper lobe pneumonia
markedly decreased
- doing well.  A&O.  on 4L NC, sats in high 90s.  gentle
diuresis. lasix 20mg once.  hct 28-->26-->25-->24.  GI consult:
possible infected diverticuli with perf with 2ndary partial SBO
or ischemic colon with perf. no emergent intervention/scope at
this time.  conservative treatment with hydration and IV abx,
serial hcts.  this AM, pt started to have increased WOB and
tachypnea. another lasix 20mg.  pt improved. febrile to 101. pan
cx. APAP PR. s/p splenectomy and chronic steroids thus with
increased risk of infections. last night febrile to 101. APAP
PR. pan cx.  primary team wants to consider adding fluconzole
and ID consult.  currently on Vanc/Zosyn, to cover HAP and
diverticulitis.
[**1-9**] Fluconazole added, d/w ID. ID also recommended consider add
cipro if continues to spike fevers for double gram neg coverage.
[**1-9**] HCT dropped slightly at noon to 23.6 from 24.6, but was
stable for 9 hours at 23.0. Had another episode of blood per
rectum (red/maroon/clot) at 10pm. Repeat HCT to be checked at
2am.

smaller than prior exam. Left lower lobe pneumonia, new since
prior exam.
[**1-15**]: failed weaning
[**1-15**]: ID consult: see below for recs
[**1-16**]: Started Voriconazole, CT chest worse, CT head done (WNL),
unable to wean off vent, needed to increase PSV, HCP consented
for trach/peg in future
[**1-17**]: spiked to 102.1.  pan cx. requiring increased vent
support. d/c'd fluconazole. tracheal asp sent for PCP. 2 doses
of lasix to keep him even. minimal output, increased Cr.
intermittent runs of V-tach. BPs stable. today: trach bedside,
peg by IR.
[**1-18**] attempted PICC line placement, but failed. Placed L IJ for
access.
[**1-18**] Bcx from [**1-17**] grew out GPCs in pairs and short chains.
[**1-19**] bedside trach/peg converted to open trach/peg in OR, +VRE,
antibiotics changed, increasing Cr, hypotensive --> neo gtt
