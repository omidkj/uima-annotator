Pertinent Results:
[**2108-8-8**] Echo: Pre bypass: The left atrium is elongated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets, although the right and non coronary
cusps appear partially fused. There is a large mass on the non
coronary cusp with some mobile components. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.
Post bypass: preserved biventricular function LVEF 55%. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve is insitu with no AI or perivalvular
leaks. Peak graident 19, mean 11 mm hg. Aortic contours intact.
Remainging exam is unchanged. All findings discussed surgeons at
the time of the exam.

was adjusted and he was started on lantus.  He remained in the
intensive care unit an extra day to manage his blood glucose.
Post operative day two he was transferred to the floor for the
remainder of his care.  Physical therapy worked with him on
