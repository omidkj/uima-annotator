same day. His vasoactive drips were weaned to off by POD #1. He
was transferred to the floor on POD #2. He was started on
heparin and coumadin for his mechanical valve and atrial

and his creatinine began to return to baseline. On [**2139-9-18**] he
reported new onset right leg weakness and dysarthria. He was
seen in consultation by neurology who recommended a CT scan
