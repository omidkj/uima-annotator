CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2192-12-25**] 9:22 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval ptx with chest tubes clamped

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
86 year old woman s/p apicoaortic conduit
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval ptx with chest tubes clamped
INDICATIONS: 86-year-old woman status post apical aortic conduit
placement. Please evaluate for pneumothorax with chest tubes
clamped.

CHEST, PORTABLE AP: Comparison is made to the prior day. The
configuration of two left-sided chest tubes, a right internal
jugular central venous catheter, and a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD
device is unchanged. There is no evidence for pneumothorax or
effusion. Mild prominence of central pulmonary vessels is
unchanged. Left basilar atelectasis appears improved.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe symmetric LVH. Moderately depressed LVEF.


RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in
ascending aorta. Normal descending aorta diameter. Complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2).

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
(1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pred-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left
atrial appendage. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 - 35 %). with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB: The patient received a valved conduit from the LV apex
to the descending aorta, on bypass, with continuous VFib. Meds
are Amiodarone infusion and low dose Phenylephrine. A-Paced.
LV fxn is still moderately depressed with EF 30%. There is a
conduit from the LV apex to the descending aorta, with flow
noted. There is considerable reduction in the flow thru the
LVOT. Aorta is intact otherwise. RV systolic fxn mildly to
moderately reduced.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted preoperatively. On [**12-18**] she underwent an
apico-aortic conduit with 19 mm tissue valve. She was
transferred to the ICU in stable condition. She was extubated on
POD #1. She was started on amio and must remain on it for life.
She remained in the ICU for pulmonary toilet. Creatinine bumped
but peaked at 1.9, and has returned to [**Location 213**]. She was
transferred to the floor on POD #6. She had an air leak and her
chest tubes were placed to water seal and then clamped with no
pneumothorax prior to being discontinued. She was ready for
discharge to rehab on POD #8.
