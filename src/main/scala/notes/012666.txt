Final Report
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND

INDICATION:  46-year-old man with ETOH cirrhosis and ascites,
now with
pancreatic enzyme elevation, abdominal pain, evaluate for
obstruction.  Please
also [**Hospital **] for paracentesis.

ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:  Comparison is made to prior examination
dated [**2198-11-7**].
Again noted is a coarse echogenic liver.  No focal lesions are
seen.  The
gallbladder is filled with sludge, however the gallbladder is
not dilated.
There is a small amount of ascites surrounding the liver.  A
small-to-moderate
amount is seen in the left lower quadrant as well.  The common
bile duct is
not dilated measuring 6 mm.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Coarse echogenic liver consistent with cirrhosis.  No focal
liver lesions
are identified.

2.  Gallbladder filled with sludge.

2.  Small-to-moderate amount of ascites.

   [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
46 year old man with EtOH cirrhosis now w/ intermittant CVA
tendernesss
radiating to his groin. UA w/ blood
   REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please r/o nephrolithiasis, also evaluate pancreas as enzymes
tripled over past
4 days
   CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST:
None.



Preliminary Report
HISTORY:  46-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis with CVA
tenderness
radiating to his groin.  Evaluate for nephrolithiasis and also
evaluate
pancreas for elevated enzymes.

TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector contiguous axial images of the abdomen
and pelvis
were obtained both prior to and following the administration of
intravenous
contrast with reformatted images in the coronal and sagittal
planes.
Comparison was made to a prior study of [**2198-11-6**].

CT ABDOMEN: Images through the lung bases demonstrates a small
left-sided
pleural effusion, which has decreased compared to the study of
one week prior.
Previously seen lower lobe consolidations are predominantly
resolved on the
right, but are decreased and present on the left.  Calcified
granuloma is seen
at the left lung base as well as a calcified left hilar node is
again noted.

Again noted is a diffusely low attenuation liver consistent with
fatty
infiltration.  The vasculature of the liver is patent.  Again
noted is a
distended gallbladder with sludge unchanged. The pancreas is
normal in
appearance and enhances uniformly.  The spleen, adrenal glands,
left kidney,
and stomach are grossly normal.  The aorta and mesenteric
vessels remain
patent.

There is a large amount of ascites; however, it is slightly
decreased compared
to the study of one week ago.

Within the lower pole of the right kidney, there is a 3 mm
nonobstructing
stone seen.  The loops of small bowel are mildly dilated and
edematous, no
transition point is seen.  In the mid ileum, there is focal area
of narrowing
of the ileum (image 65), which is likely secondary to
peristalsis.

Multiple mesenteric lymph nodes mea
