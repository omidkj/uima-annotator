[**2124-7-7**]:  chest x-ray:

FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  A
trauma board
overlies the patient.  Lung volumes are low, exaggerating
bronchovascular
markings and cardiomegaly.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and
lungs are otherwise unremarkable.  Rib fracture is better
evaluated on the same-day CT.

[**2124-7-7**]:  CTA neck:

 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal study, due to relatively poor contrast
opacification, with
1.  No evidence of dissection, pseudoaneurysm formation or other
acute injury to the horizontal or pre-cavernous segments of the
left internal carotid artery at the sites of known central skull
base fracture.
2.  No evidence of craniocervical vascular injury, elsewhere.
3.  Despite fracture involvement of the left jugular foramen,
there is no
evidence of injury or thrombosis of the left jugular bulb, or
the remaining dural venous sinuses.


Metallic clips overlie the left upper quadrant.

[**2124-7-7**]:  cat scan of the c-spine:


IMPRESSION:
1.  No cervical spine fracture, acute alignment abnormality, or
prevertebral soft tissue abnormality.
2.  Opacification of left mastoid air cells, related to
temporoocipital
fracture better seen on same day head CT.

[**2124-7-7**]:  cat scan of the head:

IMPRESSION:
1.  Fracture to the left carotid canal for which a CTA is
recommended to rule out vascular injury.
2.  Fracture of the superior and inferior portion of the left
optic canal
without evidence of retrobulbar hematoma.
3.  Fracture of the inner and outer table of the left frontal
sinus with
adjacent pneumocephalus.
4.  Fracture through the left temporal bone extending throught
the occipital bone and to the foramen magnum, with a tiny focus
of adjacent pneumocephalus,
involving the sphenoid dural sinus but sparing the otic capsule.

5.  Additional fractures as described above including fracture
through the anterior skull base.

[**2124-7-7**]:  cat scan of the torso:

IMPRESSION:
1.  No solid organ injury.
2.  Non-displaced left fifth rib and right scapular fractures.
3.  Wide-mouthed ventral hernia without evidence for
obstruction.

[**2124-7-7**]:  bil. foot x-rays:

 IMPRESSION:
1.  Transverse fracture through the inferior aspect of the
patella.
2.  Acute fractures through the proximal aspect of the right
third metatarsal as well as the proximal and distal aspects of
the right second metatarsal.
3.  Acute fracture through the medial base of the proximal
phalanx of the left great toe with intra-articular extension.

[**2124-7-7**]:  bil. knee x-ray:

 IMPRESSION:
1.  Transverse fracture through the inferior aspect of the
patella.
2.  Acute fractures through the proximal aspect of the right
third metatarsal as well as the proximal and distal aspects of
the right second metatarsal.
3.  Acute fracture through the medial base of the proximal
phalanx of the left great toe with intra-articular extension.

[**2124-7-7**]:  right wrist x-ray:

IMPRESSION:
1.  Comminuted intra-articular fracture of the distal radius
with possible involvement of several of the carpal bones,
although it is difficult to adequately assess on this plain film
study due to suboptimal positioning.
Further imaging evaluation with CT would be advised.
Recommendation for
further imaging was conveyed to [**Doctor Last Name **] in the intensive care
unit by phone on [**2124-7-8**] at 1:14 p.m.

[**2124-7-10**]:  bil. foot x-ray:

 LEFT FOOT:

Intraarticular fracture of the base of the proximal phalanx of
the big toe.
Some degenerative changes present at the tarsometatarsal
articulations.  There is also degenerative change in the
intercarpal articulations.  There is a well-corticated large
plantar heel spur and prominent os trigonum noted posteriorly.
There is minor degenerative change at the ankle joint.

RIGHT FOOT:

There are fractures through the base of the second and third
metatarsal bones.
There is irregularity and likely a fracture through the distal
aspect of the second metatarsal bone.  There is significant
irregularity, degenerative change at the first
metatarsophalangeal joint.

[**2124-7-11**]:  left elbow x-ray ( results pending)








Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Acute care service after a 8
foot fall from scaffolding with possible loss of consciousness.
Upon admission, he was made NPO, given intravenous fluids, and
underwent imaging.  He was reported to have  sustained left
sided facial fractures, including a left carotid canal fracture,
 right scapular fracture, isolated left 5th rib fracture, and
fractures to the right metatarsal.   He was found to have a
right dorsally displaced distal radius fracture which was
reduced with a hematoma block and a splint was applied. Because
of the extent of his injuries, he was evaluated by several
services.

He was admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring and
neuro-vascular assessment.   The plastic service was consulted
for his facial fractures and recommended sinus precautions and a
7 day course of augmentin.  Per Orthopedics, no surgical
intervention was warrented for his lower extremity fractures.  A
hard sole shoe was ordered for his feet. On HD #4 he reported
decreased mobility of his left shoulder and elbow swelling.
Imaging showed a rad
