CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Pancreatic mass.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72 year old
female who presented to an outside hospital in [**2173-3-13**],
with three weeks of malaise, anorexia, progressive abdominal
distention and increasing abdominal pain.  On workup, she was
revealed to be markedly jaundiced and laboratory work
revealed abnormal liver function tests.  The patient was
subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for further workup and was admitted here between
[**2173-3-16**], and [**2173-3-23**].  Please refer to previously dictated
discharge summary for details of her admission.  The patient
now presents to [**Hospital1 69**] for
definitive resection of a mass at the head of the pancreas.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Left breast cancer, status post modified radical
mastectomy with radiation therapy and chemotherapy in [**2169**].
2.  Left total hip replacement with a revision restatic of
the right leg.
3.  Diverticulosis.
4.  Colonic polypectomy.
5.  Spinal stenosis.
6.  Multiple trauma with right arm fracture, injured lower
back, right tibial fracture, ankle fracture, left shoulder
fracture.
7.  Congestive heart failure with cardiomyopathy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Neurontin.
2.  Tamoxifen.
3.  Amitriptyline.
4.  Fentanyl Patch.
5.  Percocet.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and Sulfa. The patient also has an
allergy to all antibiotics ending with the term "mycin",
Keflex and Vioxx.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lived alone prior to recent
period of illness.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2173-5-11**], and taken to surgery
where she had pylorus sparing Whipple procedure.  Surgery was
performed without complications, and the patient was
thereafter transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in
stable condition.  Intraoperatively, she had been noted to
have local invasion by the tumor into the portal vein.  She
received one unit of packed red blood cells intraoperatively.
She was on an epidural for pain control. On postoperative day
number one, the patient was doing well with pain relatively
well controlled.  She was noted by the nursing staff to be
alert and oriented times three but slightly confused at
times.  By late on postoperative day number one, the patient,
however, became increasingly confused, agitated, and started
falling on some of her lines and yelling at family members.
She was evaluated.  A one to one sitter was ultimately
requested and Haldol ordered.  The patient's pain control on
the epidural was somewhat suboptimal late on postoperative
day number one with a Dilaudid PCA added for better pain
control.  The patient's Fentanyl patch was also restarted.
During postoperative day number three, the patient remained
disoriented and agitated requiring Haldol for sedation.  She
remained in soft restraints with a bedside sitter.  On
postoperative day number three, the patient pulled her own
nasogastric tube out.  The decision was made not to reinsert
it.  On postoperative day number three, the patient received
a unit of packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit. On the
night of postoperative day number three, the house officer
was called to the patient's bedside when the patient was
noted to have become tachypneic to the 40s, and tachycardic
to the 120s and 130s.  A stat chest x-ray was ordered to rule
out pulmonary edema.  This was ultimately negative for
pulmonary vascular congestion.  An electrocardiogram was also
ordered and was indeterminate.  Given an arterial blood gas
was drawn which revealed the patient to be significantly
acidotic, a decision was ultimately made to intubate the
patient and transfer her to the Intensive Care Unit for
further management.  In the Intensive Care Unit, series of
cardiac enzymes were drawn and the patient was ultimately
ruled in for myocardial infarction.  Cardiology consultation
was requested and the patient's infarction ultimately
localized to the inferior wall.  On arrival in the Intensive
Care Unit, the patient's temperature was also noted to be
101.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent.  By the
morning of postoperative day number five, the patient was
stable, remained ventilated and sedated and was improving
arterial blood gas values.  During the entire period from the
onset of the patient's tachypnea and tachycardia, the patient
had been unresponsive to stimulation. CT of the patient's
head was ultimately ordered and was negative for stroke.
Part of the patient's workup at the time included duplex
ultrasound to evaluate for portal vein thrombosis.  This test
was inconclusive.  Flow was noted in the right and main
portal veins but the left portal vein was not confidently
assessed.  The patient was also scheduled for CAT scan of the
abdomen and pelvis on the night of postoperative day number
four.  The study revealed the patient had no central
pulmonary embolism but was inconclusive about possible
segmental pulmonary embolisms.  The patient was also noted to
have heterogeneous enhancement of the right lobe of her liver
relative to the left suggesting hyperemia.  Ramifications of
this finding were uncertain. The patient had no evidence of
an intra-abdominal abscess.  There was no extravasation of
oral contrast.  The lungs were clear.

Blood, urine, sputum and wound cultures were drawn on the
night of the [**Hospital 228**] transfer to the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient's blood cultures ultimately grew out E. coli.
Four out of six of the patient's urine cultures were
ultimately negative.  Gram negative rods ultimately
speciated.  [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain cultures ultimately also grew
E. coli.  The patient's sputum grew out coagulase positive
Staphylococcus aureus, gram negative rods, beta Streptococci.
 The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Follow-up blood cultures drawn on [**2173-5-18**], were negative.
On [**2173-5-19**], the decision was made to open up a small portion
of the lateral end of the [**Last Name (ambig) 228**]  [**Doctor Last Name (ambig) 8314**] incision given
some persisting redness.  Wound cultures grew coagulase
positive Staphylococcus aureus.  Wound care was initiated
with wet to dry dressings twice a day.  On [**2173-5-19**], the
patient was screened for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.  The Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
screen was ultimately negative.  By postoperative day number
eight, the patient was clearly improving.  She was started on
tube feeds when she began to have bowel movements.  Her TPN
was weaned.

By postoperative day number eight, the patient was stable
enough to be extubated  In the period immediately following
her extubation, she required frequent pulmonary hygiene.  She
was being treated for presumptive aspiration pneumonia.
Later on postoperative day number eleven, the patient was
deemed stable and ready for discharge to the floor.  At this
time, the patient was alert and oriented and conversing well
although some times forgetful and a little confused.
Screening for rehabilitation placement was initiated.  The
patient was also seen by physical therapy following transfer
to the floor and daily.

The results of the patient's pathology studies ultimately
revealed that the patient had a clear cell cancer of the
pancreas.  The findings were discussed briefly with the
patient but it is anticipated that further discussions and
management given this diagnosis will be made following
discharge.

It should also be noted that the patient had a transient
period of thrombocytopenia with her platelet count trending
down into the 50,000 and 60,000 while in the Intensive Care
Unit.  Studies were sent for Heparin induced thrombocytopenia
which were ultimately negative.  The patient was seen by the
hematology service.  The patient's platelet count was well on
the way to recovery by the time of discharge.

Prior to transfer to the floor, the patient had been started
on a regular diet and during the entire time she was on
