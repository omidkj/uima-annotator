Pertinent Results:
Intra-op TEE [**2172-2-21**]
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus is seen in
the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler.

There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There
appears to be no regional wall motion abnormalities from
transgastric views, but mid-esophageal views provide poor
assessment of LV regional wall motion due to acoustic shadowing.

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta, the greatest measuring 8mm. No thoracic aortic dissection
is seen.

The aortic valve is trileaflet. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. There is mild functional
mitral stenosis (mean gradient 4mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. There is a small mobile strongly echogenic mass
seen on the posterior mitral annulus on the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of the valve
suggestive of calcified atheroma. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen.

Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

POST-CPB:
There is a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. The valve
is well seated with normal leaflet motion. There is no
paravalvular leak or aortic insufficiency. The peak gradient
across the aortic valve is 14mmHg, the mean gradient is 6mmHg
with a cardiac output of 4.

The left ventricle chamber size is small, consistent with
hypovolemic state. The LV systolic function is normal, estimated
EF=50-60%. The RV systolic function is normal.

The descending aorta atheroma appear grossly unchanged. The
small mobile mitral annular mass (likely calcified atheroma)
remains unchanged. There is no evidence of aortic disseciton.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results at time of
study.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**2-17**] and underwent surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Transferred
to the CVICU in stable condition on titrated
phenylephrine,insulin and propofol drips. Awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated later that evening. Went into A Fib on
POD #1 and was converted to SR with amiodarone. She was
transferred to the floor on POD #3 and begin increasing her
activity level with the help of the physical therapy service.
She was gently diuresed toward her preoperative weight. Ativan
was started for anxiety.  She was transfused one unit PRBCs on
[**2172-2-22**] for postoperative anemia. Her chest tubes and pacing
wires were removed per protocol. She developed cellulitis of her
right lower extremity and was placed on intravenous antibiotics
(IV unasyn x1 week).  apicc line was placed on [**2172-2-25**] with CXR
confirmation. She continued to make good progress and cleared
for discharge to [**Hospital **] Rehab in [**Location (un) 701**] on POD # 12. All
follow up appointments were advised.
