Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
HPI: [**Age over 90 **] yo male with a hx of HTN, severe aortic stenosis p/w
SOB. THe patient reports that he has had SOB for the last six
months, maybe a little worse over the last month. He is able to
ambulate a flight of stairs at baseline, but he does not "push"
himself. He reports a mild cough over the last two days
productive of clear sputum. He was noted today at his [**Hospital 4382**] to have a fever (no temp recorded) and to be hypoxic and
was therefore referred to the ED. Per the patient's family
members, he has also been more SOB with exertion over the past
few days. The patient himself denies any acute exacerbation of
his SOB or any distress. He reports + PND, once at night, but
denies any orthopnea, chest pain, N, V, or lightheadedness. He
also denies any calf swelling, weight loss or f/c/ns,
hemoptysis, myalgias or arthralgias.
.
In ED, VS 98.8, HR 55, BP 115/43, O2Sat 94 on 4L NC. CXR
concerning for R perihilar infiltrate. Received Vancomycin and
Levofloxacin. EKG concerning for STE in V2, V3. Ekg was
presented to cardiology who thought that changes were not
concerning for ACS but rather reflect J-point elevation. He was
given 4 baby ASpirin.
.
On the floor, the patient developed an acute worsening in his
respiratory status around 8am, 5 hours after admission to the
floor. An EKG showed mild 1mm STD in lateral leads. The patient
was given nebulizers. His volume status was difficult to assess
but 20iv of Lasix was tried. An ABG was 7.46/31/65 on a NRB. He
was initially admitted to the MICU, but transferred to the CCU
after he was deemed to be in fact a surgical candidate.
.
Of note, the patient had a recent cardiac catheterization for
evaluation of his coronary anatomy in preparation of valve
repair. The Cath revealed a prox 70% LAD lesion, 100% OM2 lesion
and a non-obstructing plaque in the RCA. The hemodynamics were
as follows: RA [**9-26**], RV 45/3, PA 45/19 and AO pressure 146/56.
The aortic valve was not crossed given tight stenosis. Severe
AS.

Social History:
Widowed for 2 years. He lives independently at [**Location (un) 5481**] in
[**Last Name (un) 30506**]. He is very active in the [**Location (un) 5481**] community. He is
completely competent in his activities of daily living and still
drives a car. He has one son and one daughter, both of whom live
locally. The patient does not smoke and only occasionally drink
a little bit of wine.

Pertinent Results:
CAROTID ULTRASOUND
1.  40-59% right ICA stenosis.
2.  No significant left ICA stenosis (graded as less than 40%).
3.  Hypoplastic or occluded right vertebral artery.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM
The left atrium and right atrium are moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened/deformed. There
is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.9cm2). Mild
[1+] aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis. Normal
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Upon admission to the floor, the patient developed an acute
worsening in his respiratory status and was transferred to the
MICU.  He was given albuterol nebulizers and 20mg of IV lasix.
An ABG was 7.46/31/65 on a non-rebreather. He was transferred to
the CCU for management of his hypoxia in the setting of severe
aortic stenosis.  Respiratory therapy was consulted, and the
patient's acute hypoxia improved with small doses of lasix, and
continuous nebulized treatments with albuterol and ipratropium.
A CXR was consistent RLL PNA and mild pulmonary edema.  Sputum
culture showed 4+ GPC in pairs/clusters and 4+ GNR's, a urine
legionella antigen was negative, and blood cultures remained
negative.  The patient was covered with regimen of ceftriaxone
and azithromycin for presumed community acquired pneumonia.
Despite clinically improving, he continued to intermittently
spike fevers on this regimen, afte which vancomycin was added.
Over the course of about one week of gentle diuresis and
antibiotics, the patient clinically improved and was weaned off
of his supplemental oxygen.  His CXR showed near-complete
resolution of his right lower lobe consolidation. His vancomycin
was discontinued. The patient was transitioned from ceftriaxone
to cefpodoxime to complete a 10 day course.
.
The patient's creatinine was elevated on admission from a
baseline of 1.5-1.7 to 2.4.  This trended down to his baseline
with continued diuresis, indicating that this was a problem with
forward flow inthe setting of aortic stenosis.
.
The patient was consulted by the cardiac surgeons, who recommend
surgical repair after a full course of antibiotics.  Thus the
patient was discharged for outpatient managment of his
pneumonia.
