Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Colchicine / Bactrim

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, SOB, chest pressure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Place of central venous catheter (right IJ).


History of Present Illness:
60 yo female with PMH significant for CAD, COPD on home o2 (2L),
systolic HF with EF of 30%, PE, and NF1, adrenal insufficiency
due to chronic steroid use, and hypothyroidism who presented to
the ED with CP and SOB.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.2 P 73 BP 106/44 R 20 O2 sat.
100% on 12L. Attempts at peripheral IVs failed, she became
hypotensive to 75/40 RIJ placed for access, [**First Name3 (LF) **] cultures were
drawn from the line, she was given 1L NS without increase in BP,
levophed was started at 0.05, and titrated up to 0.08, and back
to 0.05 on transfer. Patient was given an additional 1L NS.
Vancomycin 1g x1 and Zosyn 4.5g x1 were given followed by
levofloxacin 750mg IV x1 and flagyl 500mg IV x1 as well as
solumedrol 125mg IV x1. Her CVP was monitored (initially 9,
increased to 24 on levo). She had low urine output with 30cc
draining after placement of foley (no voiding overnight). Her
creatinine was 3.5 up from 1.1. Vitals on transfer: 96.9, 61,
109/44, 18, 97% RA. Total UOP of 105 in the ED.

On the floor, the patient reports 5/10 chest pain which she
states is not new for her.  She called an ambulance for [**6-24**]
chest pressure in the center of her chest.  She took all her
morning meds but no SL nitro. She reports this pain does not
feel nearly as severe as the pain she had in the past with her
MIs. She also reports while in the ambulance she felt like she
could not take a complete breath in. She reports she has a
chronic non productive cough. For the past 3 days she's had 3
loose stools but not [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 62155**]. She has 3 pillow orthopnea
and PND. She denies urinary sx, jaw pain, arm pain, back pain,
sweatiness.

Imaging:
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2172-1-27**] at 4:20:38 PM
Conclusions
Porr image quality. The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is probably mildly depressed(LVEF= 40 -45%). Distal
LV/apical akinesis to dyskinesis is suggested. A left
ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-1-2**],
the LVEF appears improved. If indicated, a repeat TTE with echo
contrast (Definity) or cardiac MRI may better assess
regional/global LV systolic function and exclude apical
thrombus.

Chest X-Ray, study Date of [**2172-1-26**] 10:35 AM
Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid low SVC.

Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, but there is new
consolidation in the left lower lung, worrisome for interval
progression of infectious process.  Loculated pleural effusion
along the left pleural surface is unchanged. Right basal
consolidation has slightly improved in the interim.

evidence of DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. SIRS / sepsis / septic shock: Most likely etiology of her
shock was sepsis secondary to pneumonia. She had a low grade
fever with hypotension and an elevated white count. She initialy
required low doses of levophed and placed on stress dose
steroids.

After initial broad coverage, her antib
