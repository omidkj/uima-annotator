[**2121-4-30**] minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 67-year-old gentleman who had a workup for anemia,
which
included an upper endoscopy with biopsies, which showed at
least high-grade dysplasia.  Further investigations have shown
what appeared to be intramucosal carcinoma.  Endomucosal
resection was attempted, demonstrating intramucosal carcinoma
without invasion into the submucosa.  However, the margin of the
endomucosal resection was positive. He has had no dysphagia and
otherwise feels well.

Pathology [**2121-4-30**]: pT1a pN0 adenocarcinoma of lower thoracic
esophagus, margins clear

CXR [**2121-5-5**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. The appearance of the right lung, including the site of
surgery, is unchanged, the monitoring and support devices are
constant. A second line along the nasogastric tube appears to be
exterior to the patient. The small right pleural effusion and
the postoperative opacities in the right lung have not increased
in size. Unchanged small left pleural effusion and retrocardiac
atelectasis.

[**2121-5-5**] UGI: 1. No evidence of leak or obstruction. 2. Small
amount of oral contrast material is seen tracking into the
airway, consistent with aspiration.

[**2121-5-6**] video oropharyngeal swallow: Barium passes freely
through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of
obstruction. There is no gross aspiration or penetration. For
more details, please refer to the speech and swallow division
note in OMR.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted [**2121-4-30**] for a minimally invasive
esophagogastrectomy. Refer to operative notes from Drs.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] for further detail. Patient was
transferred stable and extubated to the ICU with an NG tube,
right [**Doctor Last Name 406**] chest tube, J-tube, Foley, and neck JP drain. Pain
was well-controlled on PCA. On [**2121-5-1**] chest tube was changed
from suction to water seal and patient was transferred from the
ICU to the floor. Tube feeds were started and advanced to goal
of 115 mL/hr over 16 hours. Since his surgery, patient
maintained a persistent oxygen requirement, likely related to
his chronic lung disease, and would desaturate to the mid-80s,
though as low as 60s-70s, on room air. Chest xrays were checked
daily and showed L>R atelectasis and no evidence of
pneumothorax. On [**5-5**] patient underwent esophogram, which showed
no evidence of leak but a question of aspiration, which in
retrospect appear to have been artifactual. NG tube, chest tube,
and Foley were discontinued. Patient was continued on NPO status
until [**5-6**] when video oropharyngeal swallow study was performed,
which showed no evidence of aspiration or penetration. Patient
was started on a full diet and tube feeds were advanced to goal.
On [**5-7**] JP was removed as output was minimal. Patient was
evaluated by physical therapy over his stay and found to have
good function. Oxygen therapy was attempted to be weaned
multiple times, but patient was still requiring 3L NC as of
discharge. Patient was tolerating a full diet, ambulating, and
was receiving good pain control. He was discharged home on home
oxygen and tube feeds via J-tube.
