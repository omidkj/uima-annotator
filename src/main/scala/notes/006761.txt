[**2147-2-26**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

FINDINGS:

Multiple rib fractures are identified on the right. There is
marked dextroscoliosis. There is atelectasis at both lung bases
with a small left pleural effusion. Epidural catheter is again
identified. Upper lung zones are relatively clear. Heart and
mediastinum within normal limits.

IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple right-sided rib fractures.

2. Bibasilar atelectasis, small left pleural effusion.

    Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2147-2-23**]  12:07:42 AM
 Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contracations. Possible
biatrial
abnormality. Left bundle-branch block. Anterior peaked T waves.

  CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIA

FINDINGS: There are multiple minimally displaced fractures on
the left including inferior orbital wall, lateral orbital wall,
medial maxillary sinus, lateral and frontal maxillary sinus.
There is blood within the associated maxillary and ethmoid
sinuses, and tiny foci of air within the orbit. There is no
evidence for rectus muscle herniation. The globe appears intact.
There is no evidence for post-septal hematoma. There may also be
a minimally displaced right nasal bone fracture.

There is atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous carotid
arteries. The visualized portions of the brain are better
evaluated on the accompanying head CT.

There is opacification of the major intracranial vessels as this
study was performed after contrast-enhanced CT of the torso. The
circle of [**Location (un) 431**] is grossly normal though the study is not
well-suited for its evaluation.

IMPRESSION: Multiple left-sided facial fractures as described
above.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

BONE WINDOWS: Aside from the sternal fracture and rib fractures,
there are severe degenerative changes, severe osteopenia, and
scoliosis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Traumatic injuries include mildly displaced sternal fracture
without underlying hematoma and multiple rib fractures
bilaterally.
2. Aneurysmal ascending aorta measuring up to 4.1 cm.
3. Porcelain gallbladder.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild anterolisthesis of C4 upon C5. While the preservation of
the surrounding fat planes implies a chronic etiology, acute
injury at this site cannot be excluded. Focused clinical exam is
recommended. No cervical spine fracture.
2. Partially visualized left maxillary sinus fracture. Please
see the dedicated facial bone CT for further details.
3. Band-like opacity in the right apex is most likely scarring





Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma service. Orthopedics, Cardiology
and Plastic Surgery were consulted given her injuries.
Cardiology was consulted for evaluation of chest pain and ST
elevations noted on ECG. It was recommended that beta blockade
be started; medical clearance for surgery was granted. She was
taken to the operating room on [**2-23**] for repair of her femur
fracture. There were no intraoperative complications. She was
placed on Heparin initially for DVT prophylaxis and this was
later changed to Lovenox which will need to continue until
discontinued by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**], Orthopedic Surgery at [**Hospital1 18**]. She
is TDWB on her RLE with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] brace.

Plastics was consulted given her multiple facial fractures; the
nasal bone fracture was reduced at bedside. Her remaining facial
injuries were non operative. She will need to follow up with
Plastics, (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient. it was also recommended
that Ophthalmology be consulted to rule out any globe injuries;
no entrapment or orbital compartment/optic nerve injuries were
identified.

The Acute Pain Service (APS) was consulted for epidural catheter
given her multiple rib fractures. The epidural remained in place
for 4 days; once the catheter was pulled she was started on an
oral regimen. Because she continuied to have significant pain
APS recommended adding Neurontin. Her other pain medications
were scheduled as she was not receiving adequate relief with prn
dosing. She was also started on scheduled nebulizer treatments
and instructed on hourly coughing, deep breathing and incentive
spirometry. She continues to require nasal oxygen, currently at
2 liters/minute and was reportedly using oxygen at home. She
will require aggressive pulmonary toilet to prevent pneumonia
which is commonly associated with rib fractures.

Physical therapy was consulted early on during her stay and have
recommended rehab stay.
