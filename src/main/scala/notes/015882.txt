History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old male with multiple medical problems
who underwent a laparoscopic repair of a paraesophageal hernia
with Toupet fundoplication on [**2197-3-31**].  He was discharged to home
on [**2197-4-3**] on a liquid diet and doing well. Unfortunately he
fell
down last evening hitting his left side and this AM had a
cough and shortness of breath prompting treatment at [**Location (un) **]
[**Location (un) 1459**] ER.  He desaturated to the low 80's shortly after
arrival and was intubated at that time.  He was transferred here
for further management.  Upon arrival, he was evaluated by the
Thoracic surgery team and underwent an EGD at the bedside, which
demonstrated patency of the repair.  He remains stable on
pressors and sedation.

[**2197-4-6**] CXR :
 Status post endotracheal intubation. Findings which suggesting
a
large air pocket in the lower mediastinum, which may reflect a
dilated viscus
or extraluminal air-fluid collection, as well as persistent and
potentially
increased intraperitoneal air; correlation to CT performed on
the same day is
recommended. Moderate to large suspected pleural effusions with
parenchymal
opacities at the lung bases probably atelectasis. Differential
considerations
include aspiration and pneumonia are not excluded, however. Case
discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 7 pm in person

[**2197-4-17**] CT torso :
1. Bilobed mediastinal fluid collection containing the JP drains
and oral
contrast, smaller than on [**2197-4-6**], representing a leak,
although no definite connection to the esophagus or stomach is
identified.
2. Likely resolving hematoma at the inferior liver tip.
Superinfection cannot be excluded on this study.
3. Pleural thickening and enhancement around a partially
loculated right
pleural effusion, probably due to chronic pleural effusion but
which can be seen complex pleural effusions. The right effusion
is smaller than on
[**2197-4-6**]. The left pleural effusion has largely resolved with
minimal left pleural fluid remaining.
4. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are increased in size from
[**2197-4-6**] and are likely reactive.
5. 2mm RML nodule. If the patient has no risk factors for
malignancy, no
follow up is needed. If pt has risk factors for lung malignancy,
follow up is recommended in 1 year in absence of prior imaging.
6. Splenic infarction is unchanged from [**2197-4-6**] but new from
[**2196-9-6**].
Multiple splenic hypodensities are nonspecific but are unchanged
from
[**2196-9-6**].
7. Aortic ectasia, measuring up to 4.5cm in the descending
thoracic aorta,
with heavy ulcerative plaque.

[**2197-4-22**] G-J tube study :
Brisk leakage of contrast from the known distal esophageal leak
site filling the paraesophageal collection and layering along
the right
hemidiaphragm without evidence of reflux superiorly in the
mediastinum.

[**2197-4-26**] CT Chest/abd :

1. Extension of leak into the right pleural space. The
previously identified
collection that was seen in the mediastinum surrounding the
esophagus is
completely collapsed.
2. Status post esophageal stent placement.
3. Resolving hematoma at the inferior tip of the liver.
4. Stable splenic infarct.
5. Ectatic aorta with ulcerative arthrosclerotic plaque is
unchanged.
6. Small left pleural effusion stable

[**2197-5-2**] Ba swallow :
Small quantity of extravasation of Omnipaque elicited only
during
retrograde filling of the esophageal stent with slow passage of
small amount of contrast through to the adjacent surgical drain.


[**2197-5-4**] CT chest? abd :
1. Decreased size of moderate right hydropneumothorax. Although
no large
volume of oral contrast is seen in the right pleural collection,
there is
evidence of oral contrast leakage into the adjacent drainage
catheter. No
site of leak is seen on this study.
2. Increased size of moderate right pleural effusion.
3. Stable ectatic aorta with extensively ulcerative calcified
and
non-calcified plaque.
4. Hematoma inferior to the right liver edge is stable.
