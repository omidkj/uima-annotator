History of Present Illness:
This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA and dementia
(nonverbal at baseline with PEG), CHF, h/o c diff, Afib,
hypertension, hypothyroidism who presents from the ED after
being found unresponsive at her nursing home. In late [**Name (NI) **],
pt was admitted to an OSH for UTI complicated by c diff colitis.
Per her daughter, pt has been more sleepy than usual for the
past week with increasing O2 requirement. According to NH
records, pt was diagnosed with LLL pneumonia yesterday and
started on levofloxacin. She developed worsening respiratory
distress and was found unresponsive early this morning. Had temp
to 101 with SaO2 96% on 4L. EMS found her unresponsive and
tachypneic. Pt was intubated in the field by EMS after receiving
fentanyl and versed. Her initial BP in the field was 200/100-->
140s systolic. She was brought to [**Hospital3 1280**]. Vitals on arrival
were notable for temp of 100.1 and BP 89/66. CXR showed RLL
infiltrate. WBC was 15.9 with left shift and 6 bands. Received
NS 2L, levo 500mg IV and vanco 1g IV. ABG prior to transfer was
7.59/36/504/35. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 100.0, HR 67, BP 149/63, RR 14,
SaO2 100% intubated. She remained hemodynamically stable. Head
CT and CT c-spine with no acute process. CXR showed R-sided
infiltrate. WBC was 21 with 88% neutrophils (no bands). Trop was
elevated to 0.18 with CK of 50 and EKG unremarkable. Additional
notable labs include lactate of 4.9, INR of 4.9, K of 2.7, and
BUN/Cr 39/0.4. UA was negative. Urine and blood cultures sent.
She received 2L NS, 40 mEq K, levo 250mg, and ceftriaxone 1g. Pt
was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
ROS: Unable to obtain as patient is intubated and sedated.

Head CT [**12-22**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hemorrhage or recent infarction.
2. Large area of encephalomalacia in the left MCA distribution.

C-Spine CT [**12-22**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of fracture in the cervical spine.
2. Multilevel severe degenerative changes with bilateral
multilevel neural
foraminal narrowing.

CT Torso [**12-22**]
1. Diverticulitis with adjacent inflammatory change and
phlegmon; no discrete abscess or drainable fluid collection.
2. Right basilar airspace opacification likely due to pneumonic
consolidation.
3. Right upper lobe segmental atelectasis.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2194-12-22**] 6:40 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube in the appropriate position.
2. Multiple rib fractures.
3. Right hemidiaphragm elevation, probably due to atelectasis,
recommend
followup to document resolution.

TTE [**12-26**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate
([**1-9**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

CXR [**2195-1-13**]:
In comparison with study [**1-12**], there is now a tracheostomy tube
in
place with no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.
Little overall change in the cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular
congestion, basilar
atelectasis, and bilateral pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure: Likely secondary to aspiration given
altered mental status and recent lethargy. She was able to wean
to pressure support and FiO2 of 40% upon arrival to ICU. Was
initially broadly covered with vanco/cefepime in case of
pnuemonia, but without any evidence of pneumonia on cxr or
culture data, these antibx were stopped. Urine legionella
negative. On HD#3 patient developed HTN and increased WOB in the
setting of flash pulmonary edema. Improved with Lasix and acute
blood pressure treatment. Developed Right sided pleural effusion
and was slowly diuresed in the ICU. Although patient carries a
dx of CHF, TTE demonstrated intact EF of 55%. Due to her
prolonged intubation and failure to wean from the ventilator, a
trach was placed on [**2195-1-13**].

# C Diff Colitis: Hypotension resolved with IV fluid on
admission. Treated with Vancomycin po and Flagyl IV that was
later transitioned to po. Remaining culture data was negative.
CT abdomen demonstrated colitis and diverticulitis. Planned
treatment course f
