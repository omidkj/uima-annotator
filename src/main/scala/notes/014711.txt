Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the MICU/[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with an initial elective
intubation/respiratory support after presenting with AMS and
UGIB.

1. gastrointestinal bleed/Anemia: Upon presentation, the patient
had a stable UPPER GI bleed from presumed varices related to
elevated portal pressures. An EGD was planned, but was delayed
because of patient agitation, combativeness and AMS. Thus, an
elective intubation was pursued to allow EGD evaluation. EGD
revealed Grade I mid-esophageal varices along with bleeding
gastric varices. The patient was stabilized with packed red
blood cells, FFP, platelets. A TIPS revision was pursued - a
patent TIPS was discovered, but a dilation was performed
nevertheless. The patient's bleeding recurred several weeks
after the initial stabilization. Repeated hepatic ultrasounds
with doppler studies revealed patent vasculature and TIPS. He
required further packed red blood cellstransfusions. During his
UPPER GI bleed episodes he was prophylaxed with either
Ciprofloxacin or Zosyn.
On [**11-4**] overnight, pt had approximately 3 L of bloody stool
from rectum with a 7 pt hematocrit drop and mild tachycardia. A
left sided cordus was placed, and the pt was transfused a total
of 5 units of blood and given several L of normal saline. GI was
notified. A orogastric tube lavage was negative, a tagged RBC
scan showed bleeding in the stomach and right side of abdomen.
An US showed his TIPS to be patent. An angiography study was
scheduled for the next day, however, prior to the study the
patient's mother, who was his HCP, decided to make him [**Name (NI) 3225**] since
there was little medical or surgical intervention which could be
offered to him.

2. Respiratory Failure: As mentioned, the patient was electively
intubated to facilitate EGD. However, it was soon discovered
that he was difficult to wean, consistently requiring high PEEP.
This was presumed secondary to a ventilator-associated
pneumonia, underlying hepatopulmonary syndrome, along with AMS.
A tracheostomy tube was placed as he was on mechanical
ventilation for greater than two weeks. By the end of his stay
in the MICU (he was later transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] because of
hospital-wide issues with bed space), he was tolerating CPAP. In
regards to his PNA, he had MRSA growing in his sputum and was
treated with Vancomycin (which was changed to Linezolid) along
with Zosyn for ventilator-associated gram negative coverage. He
also had a history of biopsy-positive Coccidiomycosis, which was
initially a concern given his difficulty with weaning and
concerning chest CT (nodular right-sided opacities). However,
after negative BAL washings for Coccidiomycosis and an
evaluation by ID, it was decided that he did not have active
Coccidiomycosis and only needed to complete he previous course
of Fluconazole, which was initiated for a three-week course. Of
note, a urine Histoplasma Ag and Serum Compl Fixation for
Coccidiomycosis were ordered in the MICU.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was tried on a few trach trial and PS which he
would be able to tolerate for a few hours. His CXR's improved
with diuersis. All antibiotics were removed after a total of 14
days. After his GI BLEED, he was kept on AC in order to
comfortably ventilate him. Once his care was changed to comfort,
he was taken off of the ventilator and placed on cool mist and
morphine drip for comfort.

3 AMS. His AMS was considered likely secondary to his hepatic
encephalopathy with a possible contribution from his current
infection. Of note, his NH3 was at 59 late in his course. He
slowly gained cognitive function once Propofol was turned off,
but remained confused and sleepy.

4. Oliguric ARF: After a dose of Amphotericin (when active
Coccidiomycosis was first considered), continuous Vancomycin,
along with chronic hepatorenal disease, he had a few days of
oliguric ARF during the middle of his course. ATN was confirmed
by urine sediment and electrolytes. This resolved with
conservative treatment. A renal U/S was unremarkable for hydro
or blatant chronic disease).

5. HCV Cirrhosis: TIPS was in place and revised as above because
of concern for stenosis. He was continued on Lactulose 30 ml PO
TID, Spironolactone 25 mg PO QD, and Nadolol 20 mg PO BID. He
was placed on ciprofloxacin qWeek for ppx and then changed to
Levaquin prior to being made [**Hospital Unit Name 3225**]. Last US showed increased
ascites. Not a transplant candidate since he was actively using
alcohol and drugs. Liver service followed closely.

6. SI: There was an expression of suicidal ideation during a
brief period in an  extubation trial. The pt told his family
that his recent substance binges were suicide attempts. A
psychiatric consult was planned once his mental status had
resolved.

7. Dispo: Plan on admission was for rehabilitation for long
term. However, once his gi bleed continued and he was still in
respiratory failure, his mother made the decision to make him
comfort care. Support services were offered. Pt placed on a
morphine drip for comfort and all therapeutic measures other
than comfort were stopped included NGT. He was called out the
floor on [**11-6**].
