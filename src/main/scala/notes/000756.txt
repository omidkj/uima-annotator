History of Present Illness:
63 year old male with h/o severe COPD who is being transferred
from [**Hospital1 2177**] after a prolonged admission for hypercapneic
respiratory failure from COPD complicated by pneumothorax and
bleb rupture. He is being transferred for consideration of
intrabronchial valve.

He was admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] [**2156-5-19**] with hypercapneic respiratory
failure felt to be due to COPD. He has known COPD and was
reportedly not compliant with his medications and still smoking.
At baseline he reportedly has DOE and cannot climb a flight of
stairs and is dyspneic with shaving. He presented with
productive cough and dyspnea. His DNR/DNI status was reversed in
the ED at [**Hospital1 2177**] and he was intubated (initial ABG 7.13/96/234).
CXR showed left basilar PTX and urgent chest tube was placed by
CT surgery. CT chest showed large bulla in [**1-12**] of RLL of lung.
He was extubated on HD2. Course complicated by extensive SC
emphysema felt to be related to bleb rupture. A SC incision into
the left chest wall ("blow hole") was done by CT surgery which
resulted in slow improvement in his SC emphysema. He had
persistent air leak and small left sided PTX was seen on daily
films. Pleurodesis was performed [**2156-6-2**]. He continued to have
persistent air leaks and 2nd chest tube was placed on [**6-10**]. He
is on -40 wall suction on 1st chest tube, and -20 on 2nd chest
tube. He is now being transferred for placement of
intrabronchial valve by IP service.

During his course at [**Hospital1 2177**], he completed a course of steroids and
azithromycin for COPD exacerbation. On [**6-15**], he desatted to the
80's requiring non-rebreather with resolution of his symptoms.
CXR showed RLL infiltrate and he was started on vanco/cefepime
for HCAP, although f/u xray showed chronic changes and
antibiotics were stopped. He also developed diffuse abdominal
pain on [**5-10**] with emesis. CT showed SBO but he refused NG
tube per the discharge summary (per the patient, he agreed and
the team couldn't get it in and he refused to let them try
again). He was made NPO and started on IV fluids. He passed
flatus x 1 on [**6-14**] but has not yet had a bowel movement (last BM
[**6-9**]). Cause of SBO was felt unclear. Vitals on transfer 97.7 80
(100s-110s when moves) 106/57 [**12-24**] 95%4L.

Currently, he reports pain at the site of his chest tubes and
pain in his epigastrium. Denies any SOB, but has productive, wet
cough. States his breathing is okay as long as he has his "best
friend," referring to his nasal cannula. Denies CP. States he is
still passing flatus, but has not had BM. Cannot recall any of
the events leading up to the hospitalization and is not sure why
he was transferred here. He does know that he does not want
anyone to attempt to place another NG tube. Denies recent
fevers. Denies current nausea or vomiting.

Malnutrition/FTT
Chronic hyponatremia
H/o PTX in setting of PNA many years ago
EtOH abuse, remote
Possible h/o cirrhosis per patient
Gastric ulcer
H/o cleft palate surgery in youth with subsequent difficulty
speaking


Social History:
Lived in [**Location 686**] in senior housing by himself prior to
hospitalization. Smokes 1ppd, history of alcohol abuse but quit
[**2137**], no IVDU. Worked in movie theaters and unloading trucks in
past.




Family History:

Imaging:

-CXR ([**2156-6-17**]): The lung volumes are increased.  At the right
apex, there are severe emphysematous and bullous parenchymal
alterations.  Identical lesions are seen in the lateral aspects
of the left lung and at the bases of the right lung.  At the
bases of the right lung, a small pleural effusion is visible.

On the left, two chest tubes are seen.  According to the lateral
radiograph, they appear to be correctly positioned.  One of the
tubes, however, has its sidehole very close to the chest wall
and, as a consequence, could be advanced.  The presence of a
small basal pneumothorax cannot be excluded with certainty.
There are extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities in the
middle and lower lung zones.  The multiple air bronchograms with
irregular border suggest that these changes have a chronic
component.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is normal.  Also
normal are the hilar and mediastinal contours.

Given that this is the admission radiograph and that the
morphologic feature is complex, CT is recommended to obtain a
better assessment of the complex morphology and a valid baseline
for further followups.

-CT head ([**2156-6-19**]):
1.  Thin 2.5 mm subdural hematoma at the right frontal lobe
without evidence of fracture or mass effect.
2.  Left sphenoid bone lytic lesion. DDx includes hemangioma,
fibrous
dysplasia, but also metastasis or chondrosarcoma. Further workup
with MRI
might be considered.
3.  Small amount of fluid in the left mastoid air cells.

-Right shoulder plain film ([**2156-6-19**]): There are no signs for
acute fractures or dislocations.  There is normal osseous
mineralization.  There are mild degenerative changes of the
glenohumeral joint.  The visualized right lung apex is clear.

-Pelvis ([**2156-6-19**]): Single view of the pelvis demonstrates no
displaced fractures or dislocations.  There are degenerative
changes of the right hip with spurring in the superolateral
acetabula.  There are mild degenerative changes of the lower
lumbar spine.  The sacroiliac joints are within normal limits.
There are vascular calcifications.

Brief Hospital Course:
MR. [**Known lastname 106556**] is a 63 yo M with endstage COPD who was admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 2177**] for evaluation for a bronchial valve to help
treat his bullous emphysema which had resulted in pneumothoraces
whose goals of care were shifted to comfort measures only during
this hospitalization, and he expired on [**2156-6-22**].

#Bullous Emphysema- The patient has long standing COPD, not on
home o2, as he continued to smoke and it has been complicated by
bleb rupture with pneumothoraces.  On admission to the outside
hospital he was in hypercarbic respiratory distress and required
intubation (temporarily reversed his DNI status at that time).
He was ultimately extubated and required bipap while there. He
completed a course of a
