Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Morphine / Demerol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from outside hospital for evaluation of ventricular
tachycardia with AICD in place.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization on [**2164-3-10**]
EP procedure on [**2164-3-12**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 18036**] is a 58 year-old man with severe premature CAD
status post CABG X 2 (redo in [**2153**]) and multiple PTCAs, with
known single patent SVG to LAD, cardiomyopathy with EF 35%
status post AICD placement (per patient, had arrhythmia) also
with PAF on Coumadin therapy, HTN, and hypercholesterolemia,
transferred from [**Hospital 1121**] Hospital for further management of
VT/AIDC firing.

Mr. [**Known lastname 18036**] claims that he has been feeling unwell for the past
few weeks since reprogramming of his AICD. This is confounded by
2 recent diarrheal illnesses (last 2 weeks PTA), and a URI. He
also notes progressive dyspnea on exertion and increased use of
NTG for anginal symptoms over the past 5 weeks. + cough. On the
day prior to admission, 45 minutes after using his NTG for
exertional angina, while sitting at home, he "fell asleep or
lost consciousness" and woke up 2/2 shock from AICD. He
presented to the hospital for further evaluation.

At the OSH, cardiac enzymes were flat (CK 54, 59). He had 2
further defibrillations from AICD, each time with "dosing off"
prior to the shock. One of these episodes was captured on
telemetry and showed monomorphic VT. At the patient's request,
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] was arranged for further care.

At [**Hospital1 18**], he was taken straight to the cath lab. Angiography
revealed patent SVG to LIMA with 50-60% in-stent restenosis,
likely chronic. He was transferred to the CCU for close
monitoring.

Past Medical History:
1. CAD, status post MI at ages 25, 29, 32 and 47 years-old.
- Status post 2-vessel CABG in [**2135**] with SVG-->LAD, SVG-->Diag
- Status post redo CABG in [**2153**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG
to PDA, SVG to D1.
- Status post SVG stent in [**2158**].
- Last cath [**2162**] with SVG to LAD patent, all other grafts
closed. EF 35%.
- Status post AICD placement for primary prevention in [**2162**].
2. Ischemic cardiomyopathy, with EF 35% on last cath.
3. Hypertension
4. Hypercholesterolemia
5. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin
6. Status post cholecystectomy

Social History:
He is disabled and a former carpenter. He spends most of his
time on household chores and taking care of his grandchildren.
Former smoker, quit 25 years ago. He rarely uses alcohol.

Family History:
Family history significant for premature CAD (brother who died
of MI at age 42, 2 other brothers died [**3-7**] CAD), DM type 2,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

EKG [**2164-3-10**] after cath: Probable sinus rhythmm, rate 72.
Intraventricular conduction delay with ST-T wave changes.
Anterolateral ST-T wave changes which may be consistent with
left ventricular hypertrophy and intraventricular conduction
delay. A paced. Diffuse anterolateral TWI and ST segment
depression.

********************
[**2164-3-10**]: CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed severe native three
vessel
coronary artery disease. The LMCA had severe diffuse disease.
The LAD
had a proximal occlusion at the origin of the vessel. The LCX
had a
proximal total occlusion with bridging collaterals. The RCA had
a
proximal total occlusion with left to right and bridging
collaterals.
2. Selective graft angiography of the SVG to LAD revealed 50 to
60%
instent restenosis. The graft gave collaterals to the LCX and
RCA.
3. Arterial conduit angiography revealed a large patent native
RIMA.
4. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated left sided
pressures (mean PCWP 19 mmHg) with a normal cardiac index (3
l/min/m2).
5. The right femoral arteriotomy was closed successfully with an

angioseal device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate SVG to LAD instent restenosis.
3. Mild ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
4. Patent native RIMA.
5. Angioseal to right femoral arteriotomy.

*******

[**2164-3-12**] ECHO:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF 30-35%). Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include inferolateral and
inferior akinesis with basal and mid inferoseptal hypokinesis.
The basal lateral wall was not well seen but probably
hypokinetic.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic root is moderately dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate to
severe ([**3-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
8. There is an echogenic density in the right atrium and
ventricle consistent with a pacemaker lead.

******

[**2164-3-11**] CXR: Pacemaker tips in satisfactory position. The heart
is enlarged. No failure is seen. There is a soft infiltrate in
the anterior segment of the right upper lobe. Increased
opacification in the right lower lobe is also present. I suspect
pneumonia in both of these areas.

IMPRESSION: Right upper and probable right lower lobe pneumonia,
cardiomegaly, no failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year-old male with long-standing history of CAD s/p CABG X 2
(redo in [**2153**]), ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 35%, paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation on Coumadin therapy, s/p AICD placement 2
years ago, transferred from OSH after firing of AICD, found to
have monomorphic VT, on Lidocaine drip. Status post cath at
[**Hospital1 18**], with SVG to LAD graft patent with 50-60% in-stent
restenosis.

1) VT: The EP service was consulted on admission. Device
interrogation revealed no programmed antitachycardia pacing and
elevated pacing thresholds. A VT detection zone was added, and
atrial pacing output was increased to 5V, while V pacing was
increased to 3.5V. Per EP, Sotalol was increased to 120mg PO
BID, with plan to D/C Lidocaine. Overnight, Mr. [**Known lastname 18036**] had a
6-beat run of monomorphic VT while off Lidocaine, which was
restarted, and eventually weaned on hospital day #2 without
recurrence of his VT. While in hospital, telemetry revealed
mostly A-pacing, V-sensing.

He was taken to the EP lab on [**2164-3-12**], which revealed no
mappable VT or scar for substrate mapping. No ablation done. Per
EP, Sotalol was discontinued, and he was started on amiodarone
400 mg PO TID on [**2164-3-13**] (LFTs and TFTs normal prior to
initiation of Amiodarone therapy).

The etiology of his VT (given 2 years without events) remains
unclear at discharge. On admission, his monomorphic VT was
initially felt to be scar-based
