Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2174-3-8**]
Diffuse bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, most concentrated
within the area of the right sylvian fissure, and acute subdural
hematoma
overlying the left cerebral hemisphere. There is 6 mm of
rightward midline
shift, but no subfalcine or transtentorial herniation.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2174-3-8**]
1. No fracture of the cervical spine.
2. There is rotation of C1 on C2, which may be due to
positioning in the
scanner, though rotatory subluxation is not excluded. Recommend
clinical
correlation for this.
3. Multilevel disc space narrowing without significant canal or
neural
foraminal narrowing.

[**3-8**] Knee Xray:
AP and lateral views of the left knee are suboptimal due to
difficulties in positioning. No fracture identified and I doubt
the presence of an effusion.  No overt joint space narrowing or
osteophytes.

[**3-9**] CT Head:IMPRESSION:
1. Evolving moderately large hemorrhagic contusion involving the
superficial left temporal lobe, with likely second small
hemorrhagic contusion involving the right frontal opercular
region.
2. Stable diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, predilecting the
right cerebral
hemisphere, with the thin left subdural hematoma, likely
redistributed along that tentorial leaflet.
3. No shift of the midline structures or central herniation.

[**3-10**] Head CTA: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm
involving
the anterior or posterior intracranial arterial circulations.
2. Unchanged diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the
cerebral
hemispheres bilaterally.
3. Continued evolution of the bitemporal lobe contusions as
described above.
4. Unchanged tiny left convexity subdural hematoma and subdural
blood
layering over the left leaflet of the tentorium cerebelli.

[**3-14**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the cerebral hemispheric
convexities
bilaterally is not significantly changed.
2. Bitemporal contusions and associated edema are stable in
appearance.
3. Tiny left convexity subdural hematoma and SDH overlying the
left tentorium cerebelli are not significantly changed.

CXR [**2174-3-15**]
New left basilar patchy opacity and right middle peribronchial
infiltration, raising concern for aspiration and/or infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 77 year old woman who was found down outside house
after walking a dog. She was brought to the ED where she was
seen to be combative and intubated. Head CT revealed a L SDH and
R SAH. She was admitted to neurosurgery for further evalutaion
and transferred to SICU. She was started on dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis. Scalp sutures were placed.

On examination, patient was moving all extremities to noxious
stimuli and pupils were 5 and NR due to eye surgery in the past.


On [**3-9**], patient on examination opened her eyes to noxious
stimuli and moved all four extremities spontaneously, no
commands. She remained intubated. Repeat head CT was performed
which revealed no significant change. She was seen by trauma and
cleared. Her head laceration was stapled. Fever work up was
initiated for WBC of 15. Pt continued to not have a gag reflex
therefore extubate was not attempted.

On [**3-10**] a CTA was performed which was negative for vascular
malformation.

On [**3-11**] her C-spine was cleared by trauma and SBP was
liberalized.

On [**3-12**] neuro checks were changed to Q2hrs and she was
successfully extubated.

On [**3-13**], patient was awake, but not following commands, moving
all extermities purposefully. She remains in ICU for monitoring.


On [**3-14**], she was transferred to the step down unit and was
assessed by Speech & Swallow and failed her evaluation. a head
ct was performed which was consistent withIMPRESSION:
Subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the cerebral hemispheric
convexities bilaterally is not significantly changed. Bitemporal
contusions and associated edema are stable in appearance. Tiny
left convexity subdural hematoma and SDH overlying the left
tentorium cerebelli are not significantly changed.


On [**3-15**], patient was noted to have leukocytosis, low grade
fevers and an elevated WBC. A CXR showed a LLL infiltrate and
antibiotics was started. A PEG was discussed with the family and
the patient was scheduled to have a PEG placed on [**3-17**].

On [**3-17**] she pulled out her Dobhoff tube. She was verbal for the
first time that morning. She was oriented to self. She was
speaking and asking questions in sentences. She had memory
deificts.PEG tubefeedings were resumed [**3-18**] 24hrs after
placement. Her dilantin was subtherapeutic and she was switched
to keppra for seizure prophylaxis 500 mg po bid.

On [**3-18**], the patient was alert moving all extremities
antigravity/purposfully. She said "hi" to the examiner but this
was not clear otherwise she was non verbal and not following
commands- this has been her baseline.  The patient tracks with
her eyes and greets the examiner with a smile. A vancomycin
trogh was attempted but sent at the wrong time and directions
are being sent to the rehab facility to draw a vanco trough
tonight prior to her second dose of the day.
