Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Phenobarbital

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1945**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a very nice [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with COPD on 2-4L of
oxygen at baseline, presents with SOB. The patient chronically
feels SOB and fatigued, however, she notes a gradual worsening
of her SOB in the last 3 months with increased difficulty going
up small amounts of stairs. She notes some small amount of cough
with white/yellow sputum production over the last week. She
denies Fevers, chills, sweats. No Hemoptysis, or chest pain.
Today, at 430pm, she acutely felt SOB and was unable to ambulate
across the room at home without bracing herself. She called EMS
and was taken to [**Hospital1 **] ED. There, they interpreted her CXR as
PNA. SHe received albuterol and dounebs, doxycycline 100mg,
Rocefin 1gm IV, and solumedrol 125mg. When the plts were noted
to be <5 and an ABG was 7.44 /43/45 on 50% venti-mask she was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. She denies bleeding
gums, epistaxis, h/o bleeding disorder

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T 97.1 P 97 BP 182/79 R 34 O2
sat 96% 15L NRB. CXR showed bilaterally patchy opacitys which
were interpreted as pulmonary edema. The patient was given
albuterol and ipratropium nebs. She also got Nitroglcyerin gtt,
and 40mg of IV furosemide thinking that the HTN lead to
pulmonary edema. EKG was without significant ischemic changes.
She was placed on bipap briefly but did not tolerate it well.
When the BNP returned at 100, they re-evaluated the pateint and
discontinued Bipap and Nitro Gtt thinking that pulm edema was
not the etiology. Although tachypeic, sats remained in the mid
90s on NRB. Hematology was consulted and saw the patient in the
ED. VS prior to transfer afebrile. 83, 92% NRB, 24, 137/57.

On the floor, the patient is in no acute distress. Her
respiratory status feels improved from ealier today.

Microbiology Data:

Urine Legionella: negative
MRSA Screen: pending
Blood Culture: pending (no growth to date)
================
Imaging Studies:

CXR ([**2114-9-12**]): Cardiomegaly, scattered bilateral pulmonary
opacity likely secondary to pulmonary edema, though cannot
exclude pneumonia. Probable underlying emphysema.
------------
EKG ([**2114-9-13**]): Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact in precordial
leads. Mild ST segment depressions laterally are likely
non-specific. Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

Bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound ([**2114-9-13**]):
1. No DVT in bilateral lower extremity.
2. Left [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.
----------------
CT chest without contrast ([**2114-9-14**]):
Preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**]: severe emphysema (not fibrosis) with acute
involvement of upper lobes = interstitial ?pulm edema (most
likely) or atypical PNA (non pus-producing, ?mycoplasm) or ?pulm
hem (unlikely without hemoptysis).
-------------------
CT-CHEST with contrast ([**2114-9-16**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate-to-severe emphysema, most predominant in the upper
lungs
bilaterally.
2. Ground-glass opacification in bilateral lungs may represent
infectious
process such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
3. Initial attending impression was of no pulmonary embolism but
review of
images by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Radiology suggests segmental PE in left
lower lobe
arteries. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is contacting the clinical services with the
revised
impression of PE.
4. Small left sided pleural effusion is noted.
-------------------
ECHO ([**2114-9-16**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function.

CXR [**2114-9-17**]
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest read in conjunction with chest
radiographs
and CT scans of the chest since [**9-12**], most recently CTA on
[**9-16**].

Previous mild generalized pulmonary edema has cleared. Residual
heterogeneous
opacification in the right upper lobe and in the suprahilar left
upper lobe by
virtue of its persistence is less likely to be pulmonary edema,
more likely
hemorrhage or infection. Tiny left pleural effusion is
comparable to the
appearance on recent chest CT scans. Heart size normal.
--------------------

Bilateral Lower extremity dopplers [**2114-9-18**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary this is a very nice [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with history of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presents with
worsening shortness of breath and new thrombocytopenia.

# Thrombocytopenia: In general causes are broken down into
decreased production or increased destruction of platelets.
Decreased production is typically associated with a decrease in
multiple cell lines which is not the case here. The differential
for increased destruction includes ITP, DIC, TTP, and heparin
induced. Per Heme onc the periperal smear was without platelet
clumping or schitzocytes and she has not had known exposure to
heparin. Therefore ITP is the likely diagnosis. The patient was
treated initially with IVIG and prednisone, dosed at 1 mg/kg;
she also received one unit of platelets. The IVIG was stopped on
the first hospital day when her pl
