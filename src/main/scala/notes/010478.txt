Date of Birth:   [**2094-7-22**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Coronary Care Unit

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a
60-year-old gentleman with hypercholesterolemia who was
transferred from an outside hospital for cardiac
catheterization and further management.

The patient presented to an outside hospital today with
shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest discomfort
described as a burning pain.  There was no associated nausea,
vomiting, fever, chills, or diaphoresis.  The patient has
also noted worsening dyspnea on exertion over the past
several years; especially over the past two weeks with a
decreased exercise tolerance.  History is positive for
two-pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  The
patient is able to walk only about 50 yards before developing
shortness of breath.  His chest discomfort resolved at the
outside hospital following nitrates, and there has been no
recurrence of chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Borderline hypertension.
3.  Status post rotator cuff surgery in [**2150**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lipitor 20 mg by mouth once per
day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smokes three packs per day times
20 years, but he quit 30 years ago.  He drinks two glasses of
wine per day and is a retired UPS worker.  He is currently
doing carpentry jobs and is married.

FAMILY HISTORY:   He has a grandfather who died from a stroke
in his 60s.  He has another cousin with a heart valve.  His
mother in her 80s with congestive heart failure.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission was notable for bibasilar crackles and an oxygen
saturation of 94% on 1.5 liters by nasal cannula.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission were within normal limits except for cardiac
enzymes.  At the outside hospital, the creatine kinase was
230, with a CK/MB of 25.5, and a troponin I of 2.78.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram showed a
normal sinus rhythm at 90.  There was a normal axis.  There
were 1-mm ST depressions in leads V3 and T wave inversions in
V3 through V6.

An echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital showed an
ejection fraction of 25% with global hypokinesis.

Cardiac catheterization showed increased left ventricular
filling pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
of 41.  Right coronary artery showed an 80% focal lesion.
The left anterior descending artery and left circumflex both
showed mild luminal abnormalities.  His cardiac index was 2
L/min/m2.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient ruled in for a
myocardial infarction by electrocardiogram changes and
cardiac enzymes.  He was transferred from outside hospital
for a cardiac catheterization where he was found to have an
80% focal lesion of his right coronary artery which was
stented with a cypher stent.  On cardiac catheterization he
was also found to have increased left ventricular filling
pressures and systolic dysfunction.

An echocardiogram at the outside hospital showed an ejection
fraction of 25% with a global hypokinesis.

The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit following
stent placement for management of his congestive heart
failure.

Following stent placement, the patient had no further
episodes of chest pain.  Due to his extremely elevated
filling pressures and his poor ejection fraction, it was
decided to place the patient on Natrecor and Lasix
intravenously for effective diuresis.  It was believed that
the most likely source of his cardiomyopathy was a
combination between ischemia and alcohol use.  He was noted
to have a dilated cardiomyopathy on echocardiogram from the
outside hospital.

A Swan-Ganz catheter remained in place until his filling
pressures improved.  He was also transitioned from Natrecor
to captopril for afterload reduction.  His cholesterol panel
was checked and he was found to have an elevated low-density
lipoprotein, and his dose of Lipitor was increased.  His
oxygen requirement eventually improved with continued
diuresis.

2.  POSSIBLE ALCOHOL ABUSE ISSUES:  The patient was admitted
was admitted with an aspartate aminotransferase to
alanine-aminotransferase ratio of 2:1.

An outside echocardiogram showed dilated cardiomyopathy
consistent with alcohol use; although, the patient stated
that he only drinks two drinks per day.  The patient was
placed on Valium per CIWA scale.  He showed no evidence of
withdrawal during the hospitalization.  Nonetheless, the
patient was advised to stop drinking entirely.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was hemodynamically
stable with compensated congestive heart failure and
breathing on room air.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was instructed to follow his weights daily.
The patient was advised that if he gained more than two
pounds in one day that he should call his cardiologist.
2.  The patient was instructed to follow up with his
cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 13740**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) in one to two weeks.
3.  The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary
care physician (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4702**]) in one to two weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
2.  systolic dysfunction.
3.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.
4.  Coronary artery disease.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Prerenal acute renal failure from overaggressive
diuresis.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Lipitor 40 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Digoxin 0.125 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Lisinopril 40 mg by mouth in the morning.
6.  Toprol-XL 25 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
7.  Lasix 20 mg by mouth once per day.
