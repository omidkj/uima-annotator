Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stents to left main
artery and Left anterior descending artery


History of Present Illness:
76 year old female with a history of CAD s/p MI [**12-29**] with
stenting x 5 (likely RCA) c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] on HD, DM, HTN, CVA [**2167**]
presented this afternoon to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with Chest Pain. The
patient reports that at 5 pm, while she was at rest and lying
down, she began to experience sharp, non-radiating, substernal
pain. The patient also became diaphoretic. When she asked for
some ginger ale, the patient noticed that she was nauseated. The
patient had never experience this constellation of symptoms
before. By 10pm, the pain had significantly worsened, and an
ambulance was called. She was given ASA and NTG en route. On
arrival at [**Location (un) 620**], her EKG demonstrated NSR with STD in V5, V6,
STE in V1, aVR. She was initially placed on a NTG drip, but this
was discontinued once it was noted that the patient has a
history of AS. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] for urgent
cardiac catheterization.
.
On cath, a 70% stenosis of the left main was treated with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
2. An 80% lesion of the LAD was treated with one DES. A 90%
stenosis was nboted in the RCA, but intervention was deferred.
She was chest pain free after the procedure and transferred to
the CCU for further management.
.
The patient recently had a fall that resulted in damage to her
knee. During her previous catheterization at [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 108**] hospital,
she experienced kindey failure witha creatinine that peaked at
8.
On review of systems, the patient endorses regular diarrhea with
occasional bouts of constipation. She also reports that she
often feels diaphoretic and hot at night. The patient reports
easy bruising, but has been told it is a sequela to her ASA
therapy. The patient denies any changes to eyesight, sinus
congestion, dysphagia, cough. The patient also denies dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.

.
ECG [**11-17**]:
Sinus rhythm. Inferolateral lead ST-T wave abnormalities are
non-specific but
cannot exclude myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is
suggested. Since
the previous tracing of [**2172-11-16**] there is probably no
significant change.
TRACING #2
.
ECHO [**2172-11-11**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild aortic valve stenosis. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-5-14**],
the aortic valve gradient has increased. Regional and global
left ventricular systolic function are similar.

.
Cardiac catheterization [**2172-11-11**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Patent stents in LMCA and mid LAD
2. Successful PTCA/stenting of mid RCA with Endeavor drug
eluting stent.
3. Patent bilateral renal arteries with 20% proximal left renal
artery
stenosis.
Additional Cardiac cath [**11-13**]:
IVUS guided ENDEAVOR stent mid RCA 3.5 X 15 mm.
LMCA and LAD stent patent
.
Chest CT [**2172-11-18**]: Unsigned at discharge. But, "there are two
featuers whcih are concerning for diagnosis other than a serous
pleural effusion. The first is a roughly 15x33 mmm wide
elliptical region in the anterior costal pleural space adjacent
to the ligula, [**Doctor Last Name **] 46, which could be a mass or a resudila
hematoma. The second is a 28mm wide elliptical op-acity probably
in the left lower lobe up against the major fissure wich
contains pleural effusion. [**Month (only) 116**] be consistent with mass or
atelectasis. "




Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
76 year old female with a history of CAD, hx [**Last Name (un) **] on HD, DM, HTN,
CVA [**2167**] transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] for cardiac cath, found to
have 70% stenosis of the left main treated with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2, 80%
lesion of the LAD treated with one DES, and 90% stenosis of RCA,
but intervention was deferred. Post-cath course c/b continued
chest pain associated with SOB and hypertension, [**Last Name (un) **] req UF,
delerium.
.
# NSTEMI: s/p DES to LM, LAD and RCA during the course of two
catheterizations.  Minimal CK leak but pos trop. No further
chest pain. She was continued on aspirin and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely
need these medicines indefinitely. BP was quite high and
responded to Hydralazine 50 mg TID. She may require additional
Hydralazine IV for SBP > 190. Imdur was continued at 120 mg.
Olmesartan was held because of kidney function and Metopr
