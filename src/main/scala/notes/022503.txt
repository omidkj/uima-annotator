Service:  ONCOLOGY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 57 year old
male with non-small lung carcinoma diagnosed in [**2125-2-2**], at which time he presented with cough.  A chest x-ray
revealed a left upper lobe mass and CT scan guided biopsy
confirmed the diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma.
The patient underwent eight cycles of Taxotere Carboplatin
between [**4-14**] and [**5-5**], for which the patient reportedly had
an excellent response.

In [**2127-4-3**], the patient received XRT complicated by
esophagitis.  In [**2127-6-3**], the patient was started on weekly
Taxotere with only minimal response.  The patient underwent
pleuracentesis on [**2127-9-25**], and again on [**10-2**], for
symptomatic relief of malignant pleural effusions.

On [**2127-10-15**], the patient was started on Gemcitabine and
EGFR inhibitor.  The patient presented to clinic today for
day number eight of chemotherapy with Gemcitabine.  The
patient reports having worsening cough associated with
shortness of breath beginning three days prior to admission.
The patient had been taking codeine without relief in
symptoms.

In the Clinic, the patient's O2 saturations were recorded as
93% on four liters.  The patient was admitted for hypoxia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Non-small cell lung carcinoma, metastatic.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Codeine.
2.  Robitussin DM.
3.  Fiber laxative.
4.  Sc benzoate.
5.  OSI-774.

ALLERGIES:   Intravenous contrast.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married with four children.
Former child psychologist.  [**Country 3992**] war veteran.  History of
tobacco, quit in [**2100**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission febrile; pulse 136;
pressure 115/70; no pulsus paradoxus.  O2 saturation 94 on
50% shovel mask.  In general, awake, alert, tachypneic,
shallow breath.  HEENT:  Extraocular muscles are intact.
Anicteric sclerae.  Moist mucous membranes.  Cardiovascular:
regular rate; tachycardic to 136.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops appreciated.  Lungs with crackles at left base;
otherwise clear.  Dullness to percussion at left base; using
accessory muscles of respiration.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
normal bowel sounds.  Extremities with no edema.

ADMISSION LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 7.1, hematocrit
of 33.9, ANC 5830.

Chest x-ray, left pleural effusion with layering on lateral
decubitus.

EKG sinus tachycardia; no changes compared to previous EKG.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 57 year old male with
metastatic non-small lung carcinoma status post chemotherapy
and XRT who presents with a three day history of worsening
cough and dyspnea on exertion, with hypoxia and evidence of
increasing pleural effusion on chest x-ray.

On admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable and
started on supplemental O2, morphine and Prednisone taper.
Was started intravenous fluids for sinus tachycardia was
thought to be secondary to hypovolemia.  The patient's
respiratory status continued to decline and the patient was
intubated on hospital day number three.

The patient became progressively hypotensive and was started
on Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support.  In addition,
the patient began spiking fevers and was started on
Ceftazidine and Vancomycin for a presumed superimposed
pleural infection.  The patient's white count and platelets
began to decrease likely secondary to Gemcitabine
chemotherapy.

A family meeting was held and given metastatic cancer, it was
decided to make the patient comfort measures only.  The
patient was started on Ativan and morphine infusions.

The patient passed away on [**2127-10-29**].
