CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Progressive dyspnea on exertion

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 61-year-old
gentleman who recently complained of progressive dyspnea on
exertion.  He had a stress test which showed inferior wall
ischemia with an ejection fraction of 50% and inferoseptal
wall motion abnormality.  He subsequently underwent a cardiac
catheterization which revealed three vessel disease.  He came
in for elective cardiac surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Obesity
2.  Severe bilateral knee arthritis with prior arthroscopic
surgery
3.  Prior eye surgery
4.  Pedal edema diagnosed previously as early congestive
heart failure
5.  Hypertension
6.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes
7.  Ex-smoker

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Lasix 40 mg once daily, Glyburide
5 mg once daily, metoprolol 50 mg once daily, Digoxin .125 mg
once daily, Ecotrin one tablet once daily, potassium chloride
20 mEq once daily.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft x 3 and repair of an arteriosclerotic disease on
[**2138-3-25**].  Postoperatively, he was transferred to the CSRU in
stable condition.  He was extubated on the day of admission,
i.e., postoperative day zero.  He was then transferred to a
regular floor on postoperative day one in stable condition.
He was in atrial fibrillation at this time.  He was started
on amiodarone.

On postoperative day three, his pacing wires were
discontinued, and he was started on heparin infusion and on
Coumadin for the atrial fibrillation.  On postoperative day
five, it was noted in the early morning that the patient was
found to have a high creatinine, around 3, with a potassium
of 8.  He was given Kayexalate, glucose insulin, and arterial
blood gas was sent at this time, which showed a PCO2 of 80.
At this point, the patient was still mentating but somewhat
confused.  The decision was made to electively intubate him.
During the intubation period, his systolic blood pressure was
in the 80s, so he was started on Neo-Synephrine drip and
renal dose dopamine.  At this point, a Foley catheter was
inserted.  At this time, it was noted that the urine output
was only 5 cc.  He was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for
a raised white count.  He was transfused two units of packed
cells, and a Cardiology and Renal consult were called.  He
was transferred to the CSRU.

On postoperative day six, he continued to be sedated and
intubated and on dopamine and Neo-Synephrine.  He had, by
this point, started making good urine, and his creatinine
decreased to 1.9.  It was also noted at this time that his
liver function tests were deranged, and a Hepatic consult was
obtained.  They recommended a right upper quadrant ultrasound
and Dopplers.  He continued to remain on pressors for the
next few days.  He was started on vancomycin.  A diagnosis of
shock liver, ischemic hepatitis was entertained for the
deranged liver function tests.

On postoperative day seven, a rash was noted on his back, and
Dermatology consult was called.  A diagnosis of a heat rash
or early drug eruption was made.  His renal function slowly
improved while his liver function stayed the same.  He
continued to remain intubated and ventilated.  Late on
postoperative day seven, the patient went into atrial
fibrillation again, and it was decided to digitalize the
patient.  At this point, his renal function had improved back
to baseline.  His liver function tests slowly improved.

On postoperative day eight, a Cardiology consult was called
to evaluate the atrial fibrillation.  On their
recommendation, sotalol was started.  On postoperative day
eight, coffee-ground output was noted from his orogastric
tube, which was lavaged and cleared.  His hematocrit remained
stable at this point, and his abdomen was nontender.  Slow
weaning of his ventilation was continued.  He was also
started on procainamide.  He reverted back to sinus rhythm.

An Infectious Disease consult was obtained for the raised
white count on postoperative day nine.  Per recommendations,
blood cultures were sent.  He continued to make slow progress
over the next few days.

On postoperative day 11, he self-extubated in the evening.
He then reverted to atrial fibrillation on postoperative day
11.

On postoperative day 13, the patient tried to get into the
cardiac chair with assist.  Subsequently he became
unresponsive.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated,
and he was shocked x 3 for VSVT.  He became asystolic and was
then revived.  He was reintubated at this point.  He was then
briefly on dopamine to prevent hypotension.  He had a
transesophageal echocardiogram at bedside, with a preliminary
report of a PDA and a moderately high mitral regurgitation,
right pericardial effusion, and left pleural effusion.  His
procainamide was discontinued at this time.  On postoperative
day 13, a left chest tube was placed to drain the left
pleural effusion.

Pulmonary consult was also obtained for his respiratory
status.  Recommendations are for aggressive diuresis.
Attempt to wean his FIO2 was made.  Subsequently a right
chest tube was inserted.

On postoperative day 16, he continued to be intubated and
remained in atrial fibrillation.  He was then cardioverted
and converted to a sinus rhythm.  Subsequently he remained in
sinus rhythm.  He was extubated on postoperative day 17.

Over the next few days, his condition gradually stabilized
and very slowly improved.  He reverted back to atrial
fibrillation on postoperative day 20.  His amiodarone and
Lopressor were discontinued, and Betapace was increased.  He
was begun on a heparin infusion.

He was finally deemed ready to transfer to the regular floor
on postoperative day 21.  Subsequently he has remained stable
and has made remarkable progress.  He continues to be in
sinus rhythm.  His respiratory status was much improved, and
he is currently ready for discharge to a rehabilitation
facility.
