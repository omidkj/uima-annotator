Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, pulmonary embolism

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 yoF s/p CABD x 4 vessel on [**2177-10-10**] at [**Hospital1 498**],
who was at [**Hospital3 **] rehab when she developed shortness of breath
and hypoxia starting yesterday morning.  Symptoms began as
palpitations while brushing teeth and then she was noted to have
decreased O2 sats & SOB.  Of note, she has been on O2 since
being discharged from [**Hospital1 498**] on [**2177-10-16**] s/p CABG.  At [**Hospital1 80956**] as part of the work-up for the hypoxia,
she was found to have multiple large PE's though she remained
hemodynamically stable.  She was started on heparin ggt, got
lasix 40 mg PO x 2, metoprolol 12.5 mg, lisinopril 2.5 mg, and
transferred here; she also received mucomyst.  Of note, she
reports good activity levels over the last three weeks at rehab
and is up and about walking the floors and climbing [**11-29**] flight
stairs.
.
In the ED here on transfer, VS were T 98.8, BP 128/72, HR 78, RR
18, 95% NRB (desatted to 90% on 6LNC).  CT chest showed a
left-sided effusion and a large right-sided PE with multiple
other PE's throughout bilaterally, as well as evidence of right
heart strain with a flattened intraventricular septum.
Cardiology was consulted and felt there was no indication for
percutaneous embolectomy given she is HD stable.  Attempts have
been made to contact CT surgery regarding risks of lytics with
recent CABG.
.
Currently she denies SOB.  She reports a sensation of
"tightnight" that is bandlike bilaterally acrosss her chest,
which has been going on since her CABG.  She otherwise denies
HA, lightheadedness, SOB currently, CP, abd pain, change in
BM's, N/V, change in urinary frequency/urgency.  She reports
feeling thirsty though she is noted ot have a face mask on.

Pertinent Results:
Admission labs [**2177-11-5**] notable for Cr 1.5 (baseline 0.9-1.1; 1.3

(baseline), plt 274, negative trop/CK

.
[**2177-11-5**] ADMISSION CTA CHEST:
1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, as proximal as the
distal right main pulmonary artery and involving bilateral lobar
branches supplying all lobes bilaterally, with segmental and
subsegmental involvement as well. Slight bowing of the
intraventricular septum, concerning for possible right heart
strain.
2. Large left pleural effusion with associated overlying
atelectasis.
3. Emphysema with pulmonary nodules as above. Given the history
of cigarette use, followup with a dedicated CT of the chest is
recommended in 6 months.
4. Indeterminate right adrenal lesion. Further characterization
can be obtained with adrenal protocol MRI or CT.
5. Atrophic left kidney with numerous hypodensities, some of
which are
characterized as simple cysts, others of which are too small to
characterize.
.
ECG [**2177-11-5**]: Sinus rhythm. Low limb lead QRS voltage. Prolonged
QTc interval. Findings are non-specific

TTE [**2177-11-6**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with focal
basal free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Probable
diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricle is not well seen but
may be dilated with mild basal hypokinesis. No pathologic
valvular abnormality seen. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. These findings could be consistent with a
pulmonary

Brief Hospital Course:
73 yoF s/p CABG in [**10-6**] a/w large clot burden of bilateral
PE's; hemodynamically stable with no indication for
embolectomy/lytics on admission.
.
#. PULMONARY EMBOLISM:
The patient developed sudden worsening shortness of breath and
hypoxia starting on the morning of [**11-4**]. She was brought to an
OSH, where she was found to have multiple large PE's. She was
started on heparin ggt, got lasix 40 mg PO x 2, metoprolol 12.5
mg, lisinopril 2.5 mg, mucomyst and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
On admission, CT chest showed a left-sided effusion and a large
right-sided PE with multiple other PE's throughout bilaterally,
as well as evidence of right heart strain with a flattened
intraventricular septum. The patiient remained hemodynamically
stable, so embolectomy was not pursued. She was observed
overnight in the MICU, and transferred to the floor the
following day.  She was started on warfarin after 48hrs of full
anticoagulation with heparin gtt.  She remained hemodynamically
stable thoughtout her hospital course.  Her O2 was weaned to
room air, but with some desaturatio
