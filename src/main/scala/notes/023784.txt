Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1**]
Chief Complaint:
sepsis secondary to perforated sigmoid diverticulitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
exploratory laparotomy, sigmoidectomy, transverse end colostomy

History of Present Illness:
86 yoM with recently diagosed infiltrative glioma as well as
htn, who p/w 1-2 weeks of decreased po intake and fatigue, found
by niece to have HR in 160s. Patient notes that he has not been
eating and drinking normally in the last week. He states he has
had no desire to eat or drink.  He thinks it may be due to his
steroids. He also notes feeling generally fatigued. Normally he
can go up a flight of stairs without difficulty but has not been
able to do so in the last week.  He otherwise denies fevers,
chills, cough, diarrhea, urinary complaints, chest pain,
shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, orthopnea,
PND. He does note some lower extremity swelling since starting
steroids. He also notes balance problems over the last few
months as well as intermittent dysarthria.  However, he denies
and vision changes, numbness, weakness, bowel or bladder
incontinence, or loss of consciousness.
.
In the ED, T 96.0, BP 98/57, HR 140.  EKG showed Aflutter in the
150s as well as possible coarse Afib. Patient has no prior
history of Afib/flutter. Patient was felt to be very dry on exam
and IVFs were begun in both arms.  He received diltiazem 10 mg
IV x 2 with HRs decreasing to the 100s but SBPs also dropping to
the 80s.  HRs then jumped back into the 130s-140s and a
diltiazem drip was started.  Patient then converted to sinus
rhythm and diltiazem drip was discontinued.  However, he
remained hypotensive. Given that patient is on steroids as an
outpatient for recently diagnosed glioma, differential of
adrenal insufficiency was considered and he was given 100 mg of
hydrocortisone IV.  A CXR was performed which was unremarkable
as was a U/A.  However, labs were significant for a leukocytosis
of 14,000 with a left shift including 11% bands.  A set of
cardiac enzymes were drawn which were negative.  He received 4 L
of NS in the ED with SBPs in high 80s low 90s at the time of
transfer to the floor but patient was awake, alert, and
mentating.
.
Of note, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on the Neuro service
[**Date range (1) 22730**] when he presented with 24 hours of dysarthria and
several weeks of dizziness/lightheadedness. His exam was
significant for dysarthria, left gaze nystagmus, and left
hemiataxia at that time. A CT showed right posterior limb
capsule lesion consistent with cavernoma. MRI showed extensive
signal abnormality involving the left temporal lobe, left
superior cerebellum, and left lateral mid brain.  A low-grade
neoplasm (i.e. glioma) is the most likely diagnosis.
Neuro-oncology was consulted and felt presentation and imaging
was consistent with gliomatosis cerebri. Radiation Oncology was
also consulted.  Aspirin was discontinued while in house in
preparation for brain biospy which was performed on [**2107-7-27**].
.


Past Medical History:
# Gliomatosis Cerebri
-infiltrative glioma: L temporal lobe,insula,left cerebellum,
brainstem diagnosed [**7-/2107**]
- began whole brain cranial radiation recommended due to
infiltrative nature (28 treatments scheduled)
- Also treated with daily temozolomide but stopped [**2107-8-19**] due
to thrombocytopenia
# DM
# htn
# Gout
# hyperlipidemia
# h/o TIA


Social History:
He is a retired civil engineer.  He was living alone but he has
moved in with his sister in [**Name (NI) 4628**], MA who is 84 years old.
He does not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit
drugs.

Family History:
No strokes.  No malignancy.

EKG (in ED): Aflutter @ ~150. Nonspecific ST/TW changes.

EKG (upon MICU arrival): Wandering atrial pacemaker @~70.
.
CXR [**9-4**]:
1.  No acute intrathoracic pathology is identified.
2.  Stable appearance of pulmonary arterial congestion.
.
CT head [**8-13**]:
1.  No hemorrhage.
2.  Abnormality in the left medial temporal lobe and left
cerebellum,
unchanged and corresponds to the previously described changes on
prior MRA examination.
3.  Stable right parietal white matter lesion that was
previously described as a cavernoma.
4.  No significant change from prior study.
ATTENDING NOTE: There is hypodensity in the superior cerebellum
with mild compression of 4th ventricle due to leptomeningeal
disease seen on previous MRI. The findings are unchanged. No
hydrocephalus seen.
.
MRI Head [**7-19**]:
1) Extensive signal abnormality involving the left temporal
lobe, left superior cerebellum, and left lateral mid brain.
Given the additional history provided of several months of
ataxia and gait difficulties, differential considerations
include a low-grade neoplasm (i.e. glioma), subacute infarction,
or an infectious encephalitis (viral, Listeria), though the
latter would be somewhat atypical without a more acute
presentation.  Correlation with clinical presentation and
comparison with the recent MRI performed at an outside hospital
would be extremely helpful.
2) Right parietal white matter lesion, corresponding to the CT
finding is consistent with a cavernoma.
3) 2-mm outpouching from the right supraclinoid ICA, at the
origin of the PCOM; this could represent an infundibulum or a
very tiny aneurysm.
4) Mild stenosis of the origin of the right vertebral artery.
