History of Present Illness:
70 yo RH female with ho HTN, DMII, Afib  recently admitted to
Stroke Service at [**Hospital1 18**] for left MCA infarct and started on
Coumadin not presents with ICH in infarction site. Original
stroke occured on ASA. Patient was hospitalized from
[**Date range (3) 94237**] after presenting with aphasia and right sided
weakness. She had h/o PAF and CTH showed large hypodensity on
left side on [**1-22**] and repeat head CT showed evolution of infarct
with minimal hemorrhage on day of discharge. Patient started on
heparin gtt and transitioned to Coumadin. She was sent to
[**Hospital **] Hospital for rehab and was doing well but complaining
of HA starting 10 days ago. Patient worked well with PT but son
noted that 4 days ago she vomited during a PT session. Her INRs
were difficult to get into therapeutic range but peak INR was 5
days ago at 5.8. Coumadin was stopped and restarted this week.
Last INR documented in OSH records is INR 4 on [**2-12**] and Coumadin
held again. Per son, patient's INR was 2 yesterday and she was
given small dose Coumadin. INR now is 1.8.

Per son, patient is at her baseline since stroke, maybe more
confused and agitated this week. She otherwise has been well, no
fevers, URI symptoms, diarrhea, CP, SOB, ab pain.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2170-2-14**] 3:39 PM
In comparison with the prior study, there is evidence of
hemorrhagic transformation on the previously described area of
ischemia in the left MCA vascular territory. The area of
hemorrhage is demonstrated as a hyperdense heterogeneous area,
effacement of the sulci, and midline shifting is also detected
with approximately 4.4 mm of midline shifting to the right. The
perimesencephalic cisterns are patent without evidence of uncal
herniation. Increase in the pattern of vasogenic edema
surrounding the hemorrhagic area as well as effacement of the
left lateral ventricle. The core of the hematoma measures
approximately 2.9 x 5.3 cm at the level of the left temporal
lobe and insula.
IMPRESSION: Large hemorrhagic transformation on a prior ischemic
area involving the left MCA vascular territory, associated with
vasogenic edema, effacement of the sulci, and midline shifting
as described above.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2170-2-15**] 10:22 AM
FINDINGS: Again identified is a hemorrhagic infarction of the
left middle cerebral artery territory and associated vasogenic
edema. There is no new hemorrhage identified. There is no change
in appearance of effacement of sulci or increase in the degree
of midline shift.
IMPRESSION: Large left MCA territory hemorrhage, with no
significant change in edema or midline shift.


Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo RH female with ho HTN, DMII, Afib  recently admitted to
Stroke Service at [**Hospital1 18**] for left MCA infarct and started on
Coumadin now presents with large ICH in infarction site.

1) Left MCA hemorrhagic transformation-
Likely etiology was supratherapeutic levels of coumadin at
outside hospital, reported by son to have [**Name (NI) 62023**] as high as [**5-12**].
She reported headache for approximately 10 days preceding her
current presentation. CT on admission revealed hematoma
measuring approximately 2.9 x 5.3 cm at level of temporal
lobe and insula compressing the left lateral vent with 4-5 mm
midline shift. Her examination at presentation was slightly
improved from her last examination at time of discharge- this is
likely because the hemorrhage was contained within the prior
infarct region.

Patient was given 2 units FFP and 1 dose Vit K far and admitted
to the neuro ICU for close observation and blood pressure
control. She was continued on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure
prophylaxis. Interval CT scan did not reveal worsening of the
hemorrhage or midline shift.

2) Lower extremity cellulitis and Enterococcus bacteremia:
She completed her 4-week course of ampicillin and gentamicin on
[**2-21**] and her PICC Line should be discontinued. In hospital there
were no signs of LE erythema, edema or tenderness.

She was transferred the floor where she was stable. On [**2-22**],
because of the concern re persistent aphasia, she had a repeat
NCHCT which was unchanged. Her exam at discharge: global aphasia
(mute but mouthing, inconsistently follows basic commands), R
facial droop and hemiparesis with RUE plegia and triple flexious
response to noxious stim of RLE, R upgoing plantar response,
L-sided strength full. She was hypertensive and hyperglycemic so
her antihypertensives (Lisinopril initially 20 but decreased to
10 due to BP dip, Metoprolol 37.5 TID, Lasix 40) and Metformin
were restarted. She is also on Atorvastatin.  Her Keppra was
discontinued. We recommend that she be restarted on her Coumadin
14 days after the hemorrhage which occurred [**2-14**], without
Heparin bridge, but this should be done at conservative doses
and with frequent INR monitoring. She is being transferred back
to [**Hospital1 **]. She is also on Hep 5000 U SC TID for DVT
prophylaxis while not anticoagulated.
