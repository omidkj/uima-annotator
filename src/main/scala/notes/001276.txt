Carotid Bruit:  no bruits

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2133-6-12**]: Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the left atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Post-CPB: The patient is
in SR, on noinotropes. Preserved biventricular systolic fxn.
Trace MR, no AI. Aorta intact.

Carotid U/S [**2133-6-11**]: Right ICA no stenosis. Left ICA <40%
stenosis.

Cardiac cath [**2133-6-10**]: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system revealed left main and two vessel coronary
artery disease. The LMCA was found to have a 70-80% distal left
main stenosis. The LAD had diffuse 40% stenosis with 40%
stenosis at the origin of a larger 2nd diagnonal branch. The LCX
had 70-80% proximal and mid-LCX stenosis extending to include
origins of 1st and 2nd OM. The ramus has a 70% proximal
stenosis, but is a small vessel. There are multiple sequential
50% stenosies within the proximal and distal RCA with a 70%
stenosis in mid-RCA. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed
systemic arterial normotension with central aortic pressure of
130/77.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9035**] was initially admitted to the cardiology serviceto
work up exertional chest pain for several years. He underwent
stress testing which showed ischemic ST changes. He was then
brought for a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe left
main and three vessel disease. Cardiac surgery was consulted and
he underwent usual pre-operative work-up. On [**6-12**] he was brought
to the operating room where he underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft x5. Please see operative report for surgical
details. In summary he had: Urgent coronary artery bypass graft
x5:  Left internal mammary artery to left anterior ascending
artery; saphenous vein sequential graft, obtuse marginal-1 and
2; saphenous vein grafts to ramus; saphenous vein graft
to posterior left ventricular branch. Endoscopic harvesting of
the long saphenous vein. His cardiopulmonary bypass time was92
minutes with a crossclamp of 81 minutes. He tolerated the
operation well and following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. He was
hemodynamically stable in the immediate post-op period, was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. On post-op day one he was started on beta-blockers
and diuretics and was gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight.
Also on post-op day one he was transferred to the step-down
floor for further recovery. All tubes lines and drains were
removed per cardiac surgery protocol. The remainder of his
hospital course was uneventful. Over several days, beta blockade
was advanced as tolerated. He remained in a normal sinus rhythm.
He continued to make clinical improvement with diuresis and was
eventually cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day 4.
