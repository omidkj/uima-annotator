Brief Hospital Course:
67 y/o female who was found to be disoriented and brought to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED. In the ED she was awake alert and oriented. CT showed
Bilateral acute subarachnoid hemorrhage, greater on the left,
and an acute/subacute small left subdural hemorrhage with
resultant mild swelling of the left cerebral hemisphere and a
6-mm rightward midline shift without signs of herniation,
Chronic lacunes in the left external capsule and the head of the
caudate nucleus, and Frontal subcutaneous hematoma with a
possible underlying non-displaced skull fracture. A MRI was
requested by the neurosurgery team however the patient has
signficant difficulty in enclosed spaces. Ativan was used to
calm the patient and she was sent down but a scan was unable to
be obtained due to motion artifact. The patient was brought back
to the ED where it was felt that the MRI was of the utmost
urgency so it was decided that the patient would have to be
intubated for the scan. She was intubated in the ED and sent to
the MRI scanner after which she was admitted to the Trauma team
and transferred to the ICU.The scan showed MRI BRAIN: Limited by
motion Intracranial/subarachnoid hemmorhage present-described on
recent CT (not transmitted) L temporal gyral edema. 6-7mm shift
to R and slight shift of cerebellar tonsils inferiorly No AVM
appreciated. MRA BRAIN: Limited by motion
Decreased flow and probable mass efect on L MCA branches, likely
related to
the L temporal edema and SAH. Rest of intracranial vessels
grossly normal
No AVM appreciated
Overnight the patient deteriorated and on exam was found to be
have minimally reactice pupils, to localize to pain RUE>LUE and
to withdraw to pain in the BLE's. She was started on Nimodipine.
Repeat CT showed  Marked interval increase in diffuse
subarachnoid hemorrhage with interval development of notable
larger amount of hemorrhage on the left side, particularly in
the sylvian fissure. This latter finding raises the question of
an aneurysm at this locale involving a branch of the left middle
cerebral artery.
An angiogram was obtained in the morning of [**2153-11-8**] which
showed a MCA aneurysm. The neurosurgery team decided to transfer
the patient to the [**Hospital1 756**] for further care.
