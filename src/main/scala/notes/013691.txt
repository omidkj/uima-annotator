Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, dark stools

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper [**First Name3 (LF) **] [**2166-5-23**] with argon-plasma coagulator

History of Present Illness:
65 yo M with h/o CAD and MI s/p ICD and stents, s/p mechanical
AVR, h/o CVA x4 on warfarin complicated by freqeunt hemorrhagic
gastritis presents today to the ED with hypotension in the
setting of getting blood transfusion because of a hematocrit
drop from the mid 20s to 19.7 and INR of 2.5.  Per the
transfusion clinic note, patient was getting 2 units of pRBC,
but after 1 unit, dropped SBP 98/60 to 82/49, mentating well.
He denied any melanic stools.  No symptoms of lightheadedness,
dizziness, SOB, chest discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.2, P 86, BP 92/45, R 18, O2
100%, 4L NC.  Labs were drawn in the ED and given his relative
hypotension and complex medical history, including GIB, patient
was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.

On the floor, patient reports having generalized weakness that
has persisted since his last admission.  He denies any new DOE,
chest discomfort, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
 His BM has been regular, once a day, and the color has been
dark, but slightly lighter than during his last admission.  He
reports taking all of his medications, including the new ones,
since the day prior to admission.  He denies NSAID use or
alcohol consumption.

[**2166-5-14**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm with top normal P-R interval, approximately 200
milliseconds.
Ventricular premature depolarizations. Inferior myocardial
infarction of
indeterminate age. Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization
abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2166-4-29**] right bundle-branch
block is no longer evident.

[**2166-5-14**] CXR: Cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions and
mild pulmonary edema. PICC line tip appears to be located within
the cavoatrial junction

[**2166-5-16**] CXR: Increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions with
persistent mild pulmonary edema.

[**2166-5-17**] SHOULDER X RAY: Clustered periarticular calcifications
in keeping with clinically suspected calcific tendinitis

[**2166-5-20**] HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage and no CT evidence of an acute
major vascular territorial infarction. MRI would be more
sensitive for an
acute infarction, if clinically warranted.

[**2166-5-23**] EGD
Many angioectasias were seen in the stomach. The lesions were
distributed in a watermelon-stomach pattern, consistent with
GAVE.  An Argon-Plasma Coagulator was applied for hemostasis
successfully.  Otherwise normal EGD to 3rd part of duodenal.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old man with coronary artery disease and stenting in the
distal LAD, mechanical AVR, and CVA x4 on warfarin complicated
by frequent hemorrhagic gastritis (also has known gastric AVM
and colon diverticulosis) who presented to the ED with
hypotension during outpatient regular blood transfusion. He was
at high risk for GI bleeding given his history and
anticoagulation with warfarin despite decreased therapeutic goal
to INR = [**1-2**]. His most likely source of bleeding was from upper
GI tract given his history of hemorrhagic gastritis and gastric
AVM. He had a recent colonoscopy in [**Month (only) 116**] that showed
diverticulosis, which can also potentially bleed. His INR was
2.6 on admission. He was treated with pantoprazole IV then PO.
From [**5-14**] to [**5-23**], he received a total of 7 units of PRBC
transfusion for continually dropping hematocrit.  After much
discussion with GI, Cardiology, and the patient, the decision
was made to pursue EGD with possible use of argon-plasma
coagulator.  Coumadin stopped and INR allowed to drift down to
1.5.  EGD performed on [**5-23**] revealing angioectasia.
Argon-plasma coagulator treatment was applied.  Heparin gtt
started after the EGD and Coumadin started the day after the
procedure.  For the 72 hours following the procedure, the
patient's HCT remained stable even while the PTT was in or above
the therapeutic range.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], the patient's cardiologist
said it was okay to stop heparin once the INR was close to the
therapeutic range.  Specifically, INR 1.6 was okay for heparin
to be stopped.  The reason is that clot formation on a
prosthetic valve in the aortic position is relatively low.  The
patient was discharged home with slightly subtherapeutic INR
with instructions to continue taking warfarin only for
anticoagulation.

The patient does have borderline hypotension and SBP in the
outpatient setting is usually 100-120. He was initially
euvolemic on exam but CXR showed some edema and bilateral
pleural effusions. We continued on atorvastatin but initially
held metoprolol and diuretics in the setting of borderline
hypotension. He then developed some dyspnea and chest pain.
Repeat EKG showed old unchan
