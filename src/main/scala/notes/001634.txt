History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year-old woman with  a history of HCV
cirrhosis, polysubstance abuse, and history of hemorrhoidal
bleeding presented [**2167-11-24**] with 1-2 wks BRBPR and discovery of
Hct 18 at PCP's office. Her creatinine was 1.1. In the ED, she
was found to have a hct of 10% and acute renal failure with
creatinine of 1.6. She had a femoral cordis placed. She was
given IVF and had emergency released blood transfused. Her BP
was as low as 80/40, but stabilized with IVF to 100/60. She
refused NG lavage.

Past Medical History:
1) iron deficiency anemia
2) GI bleed - presumed secondary to hemorrhoids
3) Sigmoid diverticulosis
4) Schatzki's ring
5) Duoenal polyps and duodenitis
6) MGUS
7) ?etoh/ HCV cirrhosis followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] (vl 9k in [**5-15**])
8) psychotic disorder
9) remote polysubstance abuse - etoh, cocaine, marijuana
10) COPD
11) compex partial seizures

Social History:
She lives alone, 10 blocks from her daughter. She smokes several
cigaretts per day, and occasionally uses EtOH, marijuana, and
cocaine. She is originally from [**State 3908**], and changed her name
when she became a practicing Muslim, which she says she
currently still practices. She worked as an administrative
assistant when she was younger, but is now on SSDI (for
schizophrenia and seizure disorder, per pt, both now quiescent).

Family History:
Mother: asthma, grandmother with diabetes, HTN.  No family
history of liver disease or bleeding disorders. Great aunt with
epilepsy


Physical Exam:
Physical Exam on Discharge

Gen: Awake and alert. Oriented to month, year, person.
Tangential speech. Easily re-directed.
HEENT: Mucous membranes moist.  EOMI. Pupils equal and reactive.
Marked scleral icterus.
Neck: Bandage in place.
Heart: Regular Rate and Rhythm. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs.
Chest: Diffuse crackles bilaterally
abd: Soft. Nt/ND.
Extremities: 1+ peripheral edema
Neuro: CN II-XII intact. Moving all extremities. Tangential
speech but easily directed.

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2167-11-28**]-The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 60-70%) There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Impression: moderate pulmonary hypertension; dilated
hypocontractile right ventricle
.
Chest X-ray [**2167-12-8**]:Severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality
has worsened radiographically but this may be a function of
extubation and the end of positive pressure ventilatory support
which has produced slightly lower lung volumes. Small bilateral
pleural effusions may be present. Heart size is normal.
Mediastinal vascular engorgement is moderate and unchanged. No
pneumothorax. Tip of the right supraclavicular central venous
line projects over the upper SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Gastrointestinal bleed:  Pt admitted with significant lower GI
bleed at hemorrhoids likely thought secondary hepatitis C
associated cirrhosis.  She underwent EGD with two cords of Grade
I varices identified, no stigmata of bleeding. Colonoscopy led
to rectal prolapse and bleeding thought likely from rectal
varices. A TIPS by interventional radiology was performed with
the intention of relieving portal hypertension and rectal
variceal bleeding.  Rectal bleed recurred on [**11-27**], with rectal
foley placed by surgery later expelled with Valsalva.
Hepatology placed a rectal [**Last Name (un) **] to tension, which
controlled bleeding.  Ultrasound revealed patents TIPS and it
was thought that bleeding may be secondary to hemorrhoids versus
varices. Patient was transfused intermittely to maintain stable
hematocrit. [**Last Name (un) **] subsequently discontinued with no
significant bleeding since. Hematocrit is stable at discharge at
30.8.
.
# Respiratory distress:  On [**11-27**] in the setting of acute
re-bleed, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was intubated secondary to wheezing, severe
shortness of breath, and increasing rales.  Vancomycin,
cefepime, flagyl started [**11-27**] to cover for nosocomial PNA.
Metronidazole later discontinued. Endotracheal suction removed
particulate matter consistent with aspiration. She also
demonstrated fluid overload and pulmonary edema. She has
received intermittent furosemide to relieve pulmonary vascular
congestion. To maximize respiratory capacity, she was started on
standing ipratropium MDI 6 puff IH Q4H, albuterol 6 puff IH Q4H,
fluticasone Propionate 110mcg 2 PUFF IH [**Hospital1 **].  On [**12-3**], pt noted
to have respiratory distress likely [**2-13**] flash pulmonary edema
after administration of D5W 250ml over 2 hours for
hypernatremia; stat CXR demonstrated increased opacities.  She
was extubated on [**12-7**] and was saturating well on nasal cannula.
 Vancomycin and cefepime were discontinued on [**2167-12-8**] after a
12 day course.
.
# Hypernatremia: On [**2167-12-3**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have
increasing sodium (147), and therefore free water boluses were
begun and IV D5W administered.  Because of pulmonary vascular
congestion, IV fluids were discontinued were and free water
boluses titrated to maintain stable sodium.  Once patient was
extubated, IV fluid boluses were discontinued in favor of oral
free water repletion. Sodium is 148 on the day of discharge.
.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine was noted to be gradually
increasing, with consideration of acute interstitial
nephritis/acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension or,
given positive rare eosinophils in urine, of new drug.
Creatinine gradually improved as overall condition improved.
Creatinine is 1.7 on the day of discharge.  Electrolytes and
renal function should be monitored daily for the next several
days given new oral diuretic regimen.
.
# Tachycardia: Pt demonstrated episodic tachycardia to 160s-170s
during suctioning, but persistent tachycardia as well into 100s
even without stimulation.  In addition, pt developed concomitant
hypertension into the 190s-220s.  Pt received Haldol for
agitation, hydralazine 10 mg IV x2, Dilt 10 mg IV x1. She was
started on metoprolol which was discontinued in favor of the
non-selective blockade with labetalol 100mg PO BID given
patient's recent cocaine use.
.
# Coagulopathy: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has had persistently abnormal
coagulation factors.  This was thought likely secondary to poor
synthetic function in the setting of hepatic failure.  Vitamin K
was initially given to correct any component of nutritional
deficiency with little effect.  She was transfused with FFP in
times of acute bleeding with a goal of INR < 2.5.  At the time
of discharge, Ms. [**Known lastname **] INR was stable at 2.4.
.
# HCV cirrhosis: Pt not on medical therapy for HCV cirrhosis.
Paracentesis results during hospitalization demonstrated no
evidence of spontaenous bacterial peritonitis.  Pt is s/p TIPs
and there is concern that TIPS may have worsened encephalopathy
noted during admission.  Lactulose continued for encephalopathy
prevention.  Total bilirubin reached a peak of 11 on [**2167-12-1**]
and has been trending downward to 8.2 at time of discharge.  She
should continue lactulose and rifaximin. and follow-up
