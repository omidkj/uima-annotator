Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Scheduled CoreValve procedure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CoreValve aortic valve replacement

History of Present Illness:
80yo male with h/o CABG x4, CVA, 100% L carotid occlusion, known
aortic stenosis now symptomatic. Patient reports shortness of
breath after walking 1 block, must rest after climbing 1
flightof stairs. He admits to 1 witnessed syncopal episode while
havingIV's started in an  upright position, 1 syncopal episode 6
months ago while getting into shower (also found to have
pneumonia). He denies chest pain. Cardiac cath showed three
patent grafts.Echocardiogram revealed [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2, mean gradient
36mmHg.
Noncontrast chest CT showed heavily calcified aorta prohibitive
for conventional surgical AVR.
.
He was consented for participation in the Corevalve TAVI study.
He met all inclusion criteria and did not meet any exclusion
criteria. He reported cold-like symptoms of head congestion, no
fever. He saw his PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 40018**] was initiated. His symptoms are
improving, he remains fever free and he was cleared by his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] dose Plavix [**12-14**].
.
He underwent succesful CoreValve placement today. His
transvenous pacing was placed through the femoral line and the
valve was placed through subclavian access. He was sedated with
fentanyl and versed and required Neosynephrine for blood
pressure supporet at the beginning of the procedure but was
weaned off by the end. During balloon dilation he developed LBBB
with a paced rhythm. He was given Vancomycin and cefazolin
during the procedure. He was extubated prior to arrival to the
CCU. He is currently mildly sedated but appropriately responding
to commands.
.
He does have a history of post op N/V from previous surgeries.
He also has some residual sensory deficit from prior CVA but no
motor deficits. He has a history of esophageal stricture so can
not get TEE.

ECHO [**12-20**]
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. An aortic
CoreValve prosthesis is present. Mild to moderate ([**1-30**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: CoreValve aortic prosthesis in good position.
Posterior, mild to moderate paravalvular aortic regurgitation.
.
ECHO [**12-23**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the
aortic arch. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. A mild (1+)
paravalvular aortic valve leak is present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2163-12-20**], the aortic regurgitation is reduced.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG x4, L MCA CVA [**3-/2163**]
with minimal residual R arm weakness, 100% L carotid occlusion,
and previous symptomatic aortic stenosis now s/p CoreValve
procedure.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis: Underwent succesful
CoreValve procedure. He was initially monitored in the CCU. His
vitals were stable and he did not have any complications related
to venous access or any conduction abnormalities. He was started
on plavix and his aspirin was continued post procedure.
.
# Possible TIA: On [**12-24**] he had a 20 minute epidose of
expressive aphasia without any noted motor or sensory symptoms.
MD was made aware after episode resolved and there were no
residual deficits on first evaluation. A CTA o
