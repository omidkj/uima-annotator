History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26818**] is a 61 year old gentleman, with a PMH of CAD and
severe MR s/p CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-AM and dRCA) and MV repair
[**8-/2182**], dilated cardiomyopathy with sCHF EF 25-30%
post-CABG/MVR, severe pulmonary hypertension on sildenafil and
CKD (recent baseline Cr 1.6-1.9),  transferred from an OSH to
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-30**] for CP, SOB, AMS.  Intubated patient unable to
provide history.  On review of transfer records,
patient noted to present with CP, SOB, AMS.  Family had noted
that the patient was increasingly altered over the past several
days to the point where he was found to be "delirious, unable to
do anything."  At the outside hospital, patient was afebrile,
tachycardic at 108, had CXR showing mild cariomegaly, CT head
without acute infarct, leukocytosis to 11.7, Cr 2.5.  Trop I
0.062 (uln 0.045), UA clear and dig level 0.1.  He was then
trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was be febrile to 102, hypoxic to 90% on
RA and noted to have bilateral upper extremity asterixis.  Labs
were notable for WBC 20, Cr 3.4, K 6.4, AST/ALT in the 1000s,
TBili 2.4, Trp 0.21, UA w/tr leuks, [**10-24**] WBC, mod bacteria,
S/UTox neg for Tyleonol and pos for opiate.  CXR showed LLL
effusion vs. PNA.  EKG: WC tach, RAD, RBBB, STE in III, felt to
be consistent with prior.   Concern for infection prompted CT
Chest & Abd & hepatic US (below) and patient was empirically
treated for ?HCAP vs cholangitis with meropenem and linezolid
(multiple allergies) and admitted to MICU Green.
.
On presentation to MICU he was hypotensive to 66/53,
unresponsive to three fluid boluses, and was started on
norepinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine and vasopressin.  He was
emergently intubated for hypoxia.  Left IJ and a-line were
placed.  He was started on meropenem and continued on
norepinephrine.  Cardiology
fellow was consulted by MICU over concern for cardiogenic [**Month/Year (2) **]
or complication following CABG/MVR and performed a bedside
echocardiogram, showing severe biventricular function with
worsened EF (to 10% from 30%); no pericardial effusion, no MR,
no AR, no ASD, no VSD, no free wall rupture. Serial labs have
shown worsening [**Last Name (un) **] (Cr 4.2), LFTs in the 6000-7000s, K 5.8 (s/p
kayexalate) and WBC 18.5 (which peaked at 26.6).  The patient
continued treatment with IVF out of concern for septic [**Last Name (un) **],
and was able to be weaned off of vasopressin and dopamine; doses
of dobutamine and norepinephrine were reduced.  Infectious
source yet to be identified.  Surgery was consulted out of
concern for cholecystitis, and a HIDA scan was recommended.
.
The patient's MVO2 trended 27->58->75->79 and his lactate
trended down from 9->5->2.2.  He was noted to have low UOP that
did not respond to Lasix challenge.  CCU Fellow was consulted to
determine whether Swan Ganz placement would be required to
evaluate for cardiogenic [**Last Name (un) **].  She believed that biventricular
hypokinesis were more consistent with [**Last Name (un) **] than ischemia,
possibly triggered by infection.  A right heart cath is planned
to investigate cause of right heart failure and do a trial of
milrinone, on which the patient could continue treatment
following hospitalization.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was intubated and
dysynchronous with the vent.  He had a cough reflex, but did not
respond to voice, follow commands or respond to pain.  His
initial vital signs were 99.5 93/56 120afib 100% on CMV/assist.
.
ROS: unable to perform secondary to inutbation/sedation
