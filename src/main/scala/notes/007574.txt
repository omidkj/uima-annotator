STUDY: CT abdomen and pelvis dated [**2195-4-3**]
CLINICAL HISTORY: 34-year-old woman with history of
diverticulitis, now with abdominal pain in the left lower
quadrant. Evaluate for intra-abdominal pathology.

Comparison made to prior CT trachea dated [**2195-3-26**].

TECHNIQUE: Multiple transaxial images of the abdomen and pelvis
were obtained after the administration of IV and oral contrast.
Coronally and sagittally reformatted images were also obtained.

CT ABDOMEN: There is mild dependent atelectasis at the
visualized lung bases. No pleural or pericardial effusions.
There is extensive intraperitoneal free air. In the left lower
abdomen, there is a gas-filled structure containing a small
amount of fluid that communicates with a loop of left colon
(sequence 2, image #66). This structure may represent redundant
sigmoid colon, but cannot exclude extraluminal collection
predominantly containing gas. As there is no oral contrast in
the left colon, a followup CT may be helpful see if this
collection contains contrast on delayed-phase imaging. Several
diverticula are identified in the left colon. There are adjacent
loops of small bowel that demonstrate diffuse wall thickening
with adjacent free fluid. The distal sigmoid colon is
unremarkable.

The liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen and
adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys demonstrate
symmetric enhancement without hydronephrosis or focal lesions.

CT PELVIS: There is a Foley catheter within the urinary bladder.
The rectum, uterus and adnexa are unremarkable. No significant
pelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.

No suspicious osseous lesions.

Findings were initially discussed by on-call resident with
surgery resident, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15737**], on [**2195-4-3**] at 1:45 a.m.

IMPRESSION: Findings most consistent with perforated
diverticulitis, with associated extensive intraperitoneal free
air and inflammation of adjacent small bowel loops. Thin-walled,
predominently gas-filled structure in the left abdomen may
represent redundant colon, but cannot exclude collection. No
discrete abscess is identified.

Operative Note
-----------------
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Perforated sigmoid with peritonitis.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Perforated sigmoid with
peritonitis.

PROCEDURE:  Drainage (of intraperitoneal abdominal abscess),
end-sigmoid colostomy and Hartmann turn-in, peritoneal
washout with antibiotics.

ASSISTANT:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 15738**] [**Name (STitle) 15737**], RES and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**], M.D.

INDICATIONS:  This patient was seen by me in the emergency
room at 1:15 a.m. on [**2195-4-3**]. She had been seen by
members of the surgical staff earlier and by emergency room
staff who started antibiotics empirically. The history went
back several weeks when she was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6426**] for
abdominal and chest pain associated with an indolent but not
controlled arthritic situation. As part of the workup, he
ordered the CT scan of the chest. In the report of the CT
scan and, in my review of the CT scan, there was free air
along the colon which was easily visible and visible by the
radiologist who, in their report, stated that they had
discussed these findings with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6426**]. Despite this, the
patient was discharged to [**Location (un) 15739**], [**State 531**]. In the
intervening period, she had been placed on prednisone for an
asthmatic situation and took continual pain medicine,
including Vicodin, almost nonstop with gradually increasing
abdominal pain, evidence of partial obstruction, distention
of 8 inches according to the patient, early satiety and
inability to eat a reasonable meal. She was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] yesterday on [**2195-4-2**], who noted rebound
tenderness in the left lower quadrant which apparently had
been present since [**3-26**], according to the patient, and he
ordered the CT scan which again showed free air, including
loculated free air, in the left lower quadrant as well as
some stranding of the sigmoid colon. There was no
retroperitoneal collection although this seemed likely on the
part of the patient's history.

When the patient was admitted at 1:15 a.m. of [**4-3**], I
decided that, since she had not received adequate
resuscitation, had been on steroids and was quite ill, that
we would do better and she would get a better operation to
wait until the morning and spend the intervening period to
replete her with Crystalloid and let some antibiotics, in
this case, ampicillin, gentamicin and Flagyl, take an effect
and, in general, try and get antibiotic control. It was
clearly a septic situation with a white count of 21,000 and a
shift to the left with a bandemia of 93%. This was carried
out and, although she stabilized as far as her vital signs,
her pain continued to get worse and start extending off over
to the right abdomen, and her bowel sounds, which previously
had been present, were lost. I, therefo
