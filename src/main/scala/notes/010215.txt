Chief Complaint:
Transfer for cardiac catherization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p Ranger LAD

who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for cardiac catherization.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] with hypotension, SOB
and falls last week. Prior to admission to [**Hospital3 **] patient was
seen by primary care physician with complaints of weakness and
exertional fatigue. Patient states that over those days he was

CARDIAC CATH [**2183-1-6**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent flow limiting disease. The LAD had a
calcified 85% stenosis at the mid segment at the level of the
first Diagonal. The first Diagonalhad two poles, and the lower
pole was occluded. The LCX had no angiographically apparent flow
limiting disease.  The RCA had no angiographically apparent flow
limiting disease and supplied collaterals to the LAD. 2. Limited
resting hemodynamics demonstrated systemic hypotension with
central aortic pressure of 81/59 mm Hg, of note this was
simultaneous with a non-invasive blood pressure cuff [**Location (un) 1131**] of
approximately 68-72/40 mm Hg. 3. Successful stenting of the mid
LAD stented with 2 2.5x28 mm Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 3.5
proximally and 3.0 distally. Final angigraphy reve
