History of Present Illness:
79 year old gentleman from transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital
with a new diagnosis of ALL. States previously with only
surgeries and mild GERD, but had developed severe, progressive
fatigue and malaise for about one week. He denies any other
localizing symptoms such as fever, sore throat, cough, chills,
myalgias, arthralgias, dyspnea, or chest pain. He was given
empiric antibiotics without any change in his progressive
fatigue by his primary care earlier this week. Given the lack of
improvement he presented to an OSH ED earlier today. ED labs
notable for profound leukocytosis with WBC 140.1k, 90% blasts,
6% PMNs, 2%bands, 2% lymphs, Hgb 11.6, Hct 34%, Plts 89k. He was
also quite hypokalemic with potassium of 2.0 (repleted with 40
mEq of KCl via IV fluids) and had a creatinine of 2.67 (unknown
baseline). A nasal swab was negative for influenza A and B. He
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for presumed acute leukemia.

In the ED the patient's vital signs were initially temp 97.5, hr
80, bp 136/65, rr 15, and breathing 94% on room air. CXR showing
possible left side pneumonia and U/A showed many bacteria.

Past Medical History:

drug
use. Lives with his daughter and son-in-law on [**Hospital3 **]. Stays

IMAGING:

CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:

[**2135-1-6**] CXR: Subtle opacity at the left lung base is concerning
for developing infection.

[**2135-1-31**]: Interval increase in small left pleural effusion. No
focal consolidation.

[**2135-2-27**]: Patchy opacities at the right lung base and in left
retrocardiac
area appear similar to the recent study, and may reflect very
slowly resolving pneumonia considering appearance on prior CTA
of the chest of [**2135-2-10**]. An area of adjacent linear
atelectasis at right base has slightly improved. No new areas of
consolidation are identified.

ECHOCARDIOGRAMS:

[**2135-1-7**] ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

[**2135-2-14**]: The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There
is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %).
RV with depressed free wall contractility. There is a small to
moderate sized pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2135-2-11**], the pericardial effusion
appears slightly smaller (still mainly anterior). LV systolic
function appears slightly lower.

[**2135-3-1**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
