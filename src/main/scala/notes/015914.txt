History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 67 yo F with a h/o asthma who p/w "an asthma attack" to
the ER.  The patient was feeling in her usual state of health
until last night when she felt the sudden onset of wheezing,
SOB, and chest tightness.  She gave herself a nebulizer
treatment and her symptoms resolved and she was able to sleep

abdominal pain, urinary sypmtoms. She had left calf pain
(chronic and unchanged). In the ER, the patient was treated with
continous albuterol/combivent nebullizer treatments, given a
dose of solumedrol 125mg IV x 1. She was started on a heparin
drip because of concern for PE, but this was stopped when the
CTA was read as negative.  Her peak flow was originally 250 in
the ER (after neb treatments), and she was admitted to ICU for
frequent nebs.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 67 year old woman with history of DVT/PE, asthma,
who presented with chest tightness and shortness of breath c/w
an asthma exacerbation.
.
SOB: The patient has a significant h/o asthma and pt's SOB was
responsive to steroid and neb tx c/w asthma exacerbation. She
was admitted overnight in ICU for continuous nebs, and then was
c/o to floor. She does have a known h/o mild hemoptysis, with a
negative AFB w/u during prior admission. She notes a h/o
orthopnea and had some hypoxia and rhales on exam. Given her h/o
diastolic CHF, she was given a small amount of diuresis with
some improvement in her hypoxia. Her pro-BNP, however, was
normal.
.
Her peak flows improved after several days to the low 300's, and
it was decided that she should be placed on a slow taper of
Prednisone and continue inhalers. She was thought to benefit
from outpatient pulmonary rehab, which was arranged. She will
also follow-up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] from Pulmonology as well. A
consideration was made of a vasculitic process given her h/o
sinusitis, hemoptysis, eosinophilia, and frequent asthma
exacerbations. She will have a work-up inclusing and ANCA as an
outpatient with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
DVT: The patient reports that she has been compliant with her
coumadin, but her INR was only 1.1 on admission.  She was
started on lovenox to bridge her to a therapeutic INR with
coumadin.  Her coumadin was increased to 7.5mg QD. She has a f/u
appt with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] 3 days after discharge where her INR will
be checked, and may d/c Lovenoz at that time.
