Service:  Vascular

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Acute abdominal and back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old female who
presented to [**Last Name (un) 4068**] [**Location (un) **] with onset of acute abdominal
back pain.  Soon after arriving in the Emergency Room, she
became unresponsive with systolic blood pressure in the 40's.
The patient was intubated.  A large bore IV access was
obtained.  A Foley was placed, and hematocrit returned to 24.
By this time, Med-Flight had arrived and Vascular Surgery at
our institution was notified and the patient was transferred
to us for further care.  While the patient was being
transferred, the surgical team was mobilized and the patient
went directly to the OR from the helicopter pad.  There was
no discernable blood pressure.  By this time, she had
received seven units of packed red blood cells and her EKG
was without ischemic changes.

The patient underwent a small emergent exploratory laparotomy
and repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and repair
of an aorto-IVC fistula by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

The only past known medical history at that time was a
history of hypothyroidism and allergy to penicillin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypothyroidism.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Was intubated, unresponsive, without
systolic blood pressure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was taken to the Operating Room.
Her blood pressure was 136/72.  Her PAP was 40/14 and her
wedge pressure was 27, CVP 14, SVR 1,096.  Heart was a
regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation.  The incision was with serous oozing.  She had
warm right DP and PT palpable and dopplerable and a left DP
and PT that were dopplerable with good capillary refill.

Her hematocrit was 37.3, platelets 126 K, BUN 13, creatinine
0.8, K 4.0.  Calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal.
Total bilirubin was 0.4, ALT 69, AST 78, alkaline phosphatase
50.  ABG: 7.23, 48, 123.  Base excess -7.  Lactate 8.3.
Calcium ionized 1.02.

On postoperative day number two, the patient remained
intubated and sedated on an insulin drip of 6 units per hour,
nitroglycerin 0.6 mg/kg per minute, phentanyl at 75 mg/kg per
minute, profadol at 60.  The patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  Hematocrit was 26.7 requiring a transfusion.  The
patient was continued to be hemodynamically monitored.  Her
serial troponin levels, initial ones, were negative.  She
remained on full vent support.  Blood gases remained stable.
She remained NPO.  IV fluids were continued.  NG tube was
continued.  IV carafate was begun for perioperative
treatment.  The patient remained on triple therapy
antibiotics with vancomycin, Levaquin, and Flagyl.  The
patient remained in the ICU.  Nutritional Services saw the
patient and recommended TPN if the patient remains intubated
and NPO.  The patient's right IJ was replaced on [**2113-5-30**] to a
left IJ with PA and cordis.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well.  Patient's hematocrit remained stable at 35.
Coags remained normal.  BUN and creatinine remained stable at
21 and 0.9, K of 3.7 which was repleted.  Abdominal exam
showed some mild abdominal distention.  The patient had good
lower extremity pulses.  Lopressor was continued to maintain
a systolic blood pressure less than 140.  Platelets were low
at 70, platelet transfusion was considered.  Antibiotics were
continued.

On postoperative day three, the patient remained in the Unit.
Total CK was 1,482, troponin levels were 0.7 and 0.3.
Patient required two units of FP and a unit of platelets for
her platelet count of 70 K.  Abdominal wound continued to
have serous drainage.  Pulse exam remained on unchanged.
Lopressor was increased to 20 mg secondary to heart rate of
92.  Recommendations were to wean vent to extubate.  Patient
was begun on TPN for nutritional support.  Bowel sounds were
noted on exam on postoperative day three.  The patient was
weaned and extubated, but failed weaning trial.  She remained
intubated as of postoperative day number five.  A chest x-ray
showed no failure or pneumonia.  Hematocrit was stable at 36
with a BUN of 34 and a creatinine of 0.7.  The patient
remained lined and monitored.  The patient's total CK's
peaked at 2,171 and, by postoperative day six, were down to
103.  The initial troponin levels were 0.7 and the patient
peaked at 5.3 and, on [**6-8**], troponin level was 0.9.
Cardiology was requested to see the patient and evaluate
regarding troponin levels and EKG.  Cardiology evaluated the
patient and noted that she was in failure with an increase in
her PA pressures because of failure.  Now reveals evidence of
a small non-ST MI.  Echocardiogram was done that showed an
ejection fraction of 40% with multivessel CAD pattern in the
wall motion.  They felt, given this, it was just a small
troponin leak.  Recommendations were to continue with enzyme
cycling, consider heparin anticoagulation if it is not
contraindicated and BB or AAA agents.  Nitroglycerin for
afterload reduction.  Given the patient's platelet count, it
was discussed with attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and he agreed with
low dose heparinization for a PTT goal of 50, but no
catheterization at this time.

With this understanding, further recommendations from
Cardiology is to titrate beta blockers for a goal heart rate
of 60 and a systolic blood pressure of less than 130.
Continue ACE inhibitor given her low ejection fraction.

Patient had blood, sputum, swab cultures, urine cultures
obtained which were all no growth, for temperature elevation
and elevated white count.  The patient was continued on TPN
and Reglan.  Tube feeds were held secondary to high
residuals.

Patient was finally extubated on postoperative day 12.  Blood
gases at extubation: 7.46, 381, 21, 28, 3, 97% oxygen
saturation.  TPN was continued and ambulation was begun.  The
patient was begun on sips of clears on postoperative day 13.
She tolerated sips well.  Her diet was advanced as tolerated.
Her TPN was weaned and the patient was begun on fluconazole
200 mg PO q 24 hours on [**2113-6-16**] which should be continued for
a total of seven days for sputum cultures showing yeast.
Physical Therapy continued to work with the patient and PT
also continued aggressive pulmonary care.  The patient was
seen three to five times per week with Physical Therapy to
increase her mobility.  Patient was recommended rehab to
maximize patient's functional status and endurance level.
Case Management began screening.

Patient was discharged on [**2113-6-19**] tolerating her diet,
working with Physical Therapy, wounds were clean, dry, and
intact.  Did have some ecchymosis along the abdominal
incisional borders and the shoulders.  Her DP and PT's were
palpable DP's bilaterally, dopplerable PT's bilaterally.
Foley was discontinued.  Patient continued to do well and was
transferred to rehab for continued rehabilitation.
