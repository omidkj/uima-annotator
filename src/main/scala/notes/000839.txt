Brief Hospital Course:
74 year old female with CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, DM,
dyslipidemia, p/w acute dyspnea.  EMS found her in her home with
respiratory distress unable to speak, requiring BVM ventilation,
gave her Lasix 80 mg IV, nitro patch.  When she arrived in the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED she was 88% on room air and 100% on Bipap.  She was
started on a Nitro gtt, given Aspirin 600 mg PR. Labs notable
for WBC of 18.9 and so concern for pneumonia she received
Ceftriaxone 1 gram and Levaquin 750 mg. It was felt her physical
exam, CXR and clinical course c/w CHF exacerbation/acute flash
pulmonary edema was felt to be most likely though trigger
unknown.  Patient was is NSR so arrythmia was not felt likely to
be contributing to flash.  Patient was therapeutic on Coumadin,
and while her left leg is more swollen than her right this is
chronic so PE was felt to be unlikely trigger.
.
When she arrived in the ICU, she arrived on BiPap at FiO2 40%
5/5 had a rate of 30, Vt 600, and on a Nitro gtt 2
mcg/kg/minute. She was able to speak full sentences and no
longer appeared to be in acute respiratory distress.  She was
given 80 IV lasix, nitro gtt was stopped at 2AM and she was
weaned to 02 via NC by the morning. Repeat CXR showed
improvement of the signs suggesting pulmonary edema. As she had
a low grade temperature of 100.1, her antibiotics (azithromycin
& ceftriaxone) were continued presumptively for
community-acquired pneumonia. Transthoracic echocardiogram was
negative for ventricular pathology. Her chest x-ray reportedly
showed bilateral extensive focal parenchymal opacities persist,
some of which appear mass-like or nodular (notably in the left
lung). It was suggested that these nodules may undergo CT
evaluation.

.
Her other chronic medical problems were managed as below:
# A Fib: Patient in NSR, INR therapeutic at 2.2, she was
continued on coumadin 6mg po qhs and monitored on telemetry. Of
note, her troponin level increased from 0.02 to 0.07, but only
non-specific changes were seen on the ECG. This was communicated
by telephone to your accepting physician prior to transfer.
.
# OSA: Continued on CPAP overnight.

# HTN: Written for her home Imdur, Metoprolol, Hydralazine

# GERD: Home Pantoprazole

# DM: Continued on (unable to confirm as patient didn't know her
dose) Novolin NPH 20 units QAM, and sliding scale.
.
# Pulmonary Nodules: CXR read " left more than right, extensive
focal parenchymal opacities persist, some of which appear
mass-like or nodular (notably in the left lung). As suggested on
the previous examination, these lesions could undergo CT
evaluation. "
-CT not yet ordered or done, will need assessment at [**Hospital1 34**] (where
patient is being transferred today).
