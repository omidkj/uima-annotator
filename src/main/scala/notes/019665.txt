CT C-SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST: Images were obatined from the skull
base through T1. There is essentially normal alignment with mild
grade I anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and mild loss of
intervertebral disc space height at C6. There are no fractures
and no dislocation. Prevertebral soft tissues are normal. There
is no central canal stenosis.
IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation; minor degenerative
changes.

CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage, mass effect, or evidence of acute infarction.
Hypoattenuation and encephalomalacia within the right parietal
and occipital lobe are unchanged and consistent with old
infarcts. The ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent
with age- related involutional changes. Osseous structures and
soft tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.

PORTABLE AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: The heart size
remains enlarged, without evidence of pulmonary edema,
atelectasis or pneumonia. The lungs remain hyperinflated with
flattening of the diaphragms. No pneumothorax or pleural
effusion is seen. A left axillary pacemaker is again seen, with
continuously transvenous right atrial pacer lead and right
ventricular pacer defibrillator lead in unchanged position. The
patient is status post CABG, with unchanged appearance to median
sternotomy wires. Calcifications are again noted along the
aortic arch.
IMPRESSION: Stable moderate cardiomegaly and hyperinflation,
without evidence of acute intrathoracic process.

CT Head ([**6-1**]):
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to [**2195-5-30**].

There are no intracranial hemorrhages or masses. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white
matter
differentiation is maintained. Again seen is an old posterior
watershed
infarct of the right occipital lobe. There is a minimal amount
of
periventricular white matter hypodensities consistent with
chronic
microangiopathic change.
