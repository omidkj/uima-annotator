[**2180-3-16**] echocardiogram

The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
the middle third of the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is unusually small.
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: there is akinesis of the middle third of the left
ventricle. This pattern is not consistent with coronary artery
disease and suggests regional cardiomyopathy/myocarditis or
atypical stress cardiomyopathy. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild
to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**2180-3-16**] CTA chest
1. Bilateral consolidation, with some volume loss in the right
middle lobe
and lowers lobe is more likely atelectasis than pneumonia.
2. Three left lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary emboli of
questionable
clinical significance.
3. A 7-mm right lower lobe nodule seen on PET CT [**2179-8-2**] is not
visualized on this study due to the right lower lobe
atelectasis.

[**2180-3-16**] LE U/S

Duplex and color Doppler demonstrate no DVT either acute or
chronic, involving both lower extremities from the common
femoral through to the proximal tibial veins.

[**2180-3-17**] cardiac catheterization

1) Selective angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated no
significant coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD had
mild
luminal irregularities with a 20-30% mid-vessel stenosis.  The
LCx and
RCA had mild luminal irregularities.
2) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed markedly-elevated
left-sided
filling pressures, with an LVEDP of 22 mmHg.  There was moderate

pulmonary arterial hypertension, with a PA pressure of 40/23
mmHg,
likely due to elevated left-sided filling pressures (low
transpulmonary
pressure gradient).  The cardiac output and cardiac index were
preserved.
3) The right CFA was closed with an AngioSeal device.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No significant angiographically-apparent coronary artery
disease.
2. Markedly-elevated left-sided filling pressures
