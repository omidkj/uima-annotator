Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
polymorphic VT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 yo M hx nonischemic cardiomyopathy and cardiac
arrest w/AICD placement [**2194**], DM2 and Hypertension, recently
admitted for polymorphic VT in the setting of prolonged QT. At
that time he presented with dyspnea, conerning for infection,
was initially started on levofloxacin. He subsequently developed
polymorphic VT storm with ICD cluster shocks requiring generator
change, performed [**4-15**]. He was discharged on [**4-20**] after PM was
adjusted to HR 90, started on mixilotine after initially being
started on lidocaine drip, as well as started on verapamil and
changed from metoprolol to toprol.
Unfortunately the patient was unable to fill the rx for
mexilitine as it was not avaiable to pharmacy, had planned to
pick up this AM, was able to fill his other meds.
Pt left hospital yesterday, felt well. This AM he woke up at
4am, developed some mild substernal chest discomfort, [**5-7**],
non-radiating, no associated sx's. He called EMS and while being
transferred to ambulance, had recurrence of his ICD shocks.
Initially evaluated at OSH, where K was 3.5, repleted,
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. He was seen on arrival to
CCU, feels well. He continue to have mild substernal chest
discomfort, [**4-6**], which he believes is heartburn, he has had
this discomfort for years, it is never exertional.
.
ROS: chest pain as per HPI, no further cough or dyspnea, no
orthopnea or PND, no recent fever, chills, lower extremity
edema, no diarrhea or dysuria. No known prior hx of MI.

5. Status post cardiac arrest [**2194**] with ICD placement at that
time.
6. Status post right epididymectomy in [**2163**] and right
inguinal hernia surgery in [**2163**].
8. [**2194-3-31**] echocardiogram with mild left atrial dilatation,
mild dilated left ventricular cavity, moderate to severe left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, delayed relaxation for
c/w left ventricular infiltrate, transaortic regurgitation.
9. CAD: On [**2194-3-31**], catheterization showed no significant
coronary
artery disease with hypokinesis of the anterior basal,
anterolateral, apical, inferior posterior basal walls with
ejection fraction of 25% to 30% and elevated LVEDP at 22.
10. VT/torsades in [**2194**] in setting of prolonged QTc (approx 70
shocks at that time)

Cardiac Cath [**4-22**]
1. Coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed no

significant coronary artery disease. The LMCA was short and had
no
angiographically-apparent coronary disease. The LAD was normal.
The LCX
was a large dominant vessel without obstructive coronary
disease. The
RCA was a small vessel and also was normal.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial
pressure with
an SBP of 123 mm Hg. The LVEDP was elevated at 20 mm Hg
suggestive of
moderate diastolic dysfunction. There was no aortic stenosis on
left-heart pullback.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Moderate diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.
3. No aortic stenosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 80 yo M hx non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, recent
VT/torsades storm who returns with recurrence of torsades.
.
# VT/torsades: This appears to be related to prolonged QT. No
evidence of active ischemia and cath did not show evidence of
ischemic lesion.
QT continues to be prolonged, initially was attributed to
treatment with levaquin, although should have been out of
system. Other potential reasons for recurrence include
hypokalemia and missing mexilletine. K may have been somewhat
low in the setting of stress and catecholamine driven
intracellular shift.  He was initially on lidocaine drip and
then transitioned to several antiarrhythmic regimens.  Final
discharge regimen was mexillitine 200mg q8h, verapamil 240mg SR
(previously 120), and inderall LA 160mg
.
# Pump: nonischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 30-40%, appeared
euvolemic.  Continued spironolactone, changed beta-blocker from
metoprolol to propranolol and started lisinopril 2.5mg daily
