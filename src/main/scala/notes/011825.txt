History of Present Illness:
77 yo M with h/o COPD, CAD s/p CABG, CHF, and PVD who presented
from OSH after being found down at home and developing
respiratory distress. Pt was found down at home this morning by
his wife who called EMS. The pt reportedly did not recall the
fall and could not provide further history on any preceeding
symptoms. Upon EMS arrival, pt noted to be bradycardic with HR
30-40s and appeared to be slightly cyanotic. On arrival to the
OSH, T 98.0, HR 90, BP 92/47, RR 28, O2 sat 80% on 40%
venti-mask with brief improvement of O2 sats to 91%. A CXR
reportedly showed cardiomegaly and perihilar fullness c/w with
CHF although PNA could not be ruled out. He was given duonebs
and solumedrol 125 mg IV X 1 without much improvement in
respiratory status. Labs were significant for WBC 15K with 34%
bands, 48% neutrophils, BUN 35, Cr 1.8, BNP 1050, CK 522, MB
15.9, MBI 3.0, and troponin 0.06. A UA was negative. An ABG was
7.29/57/45/27. The pt was sating as low as 70% on 50% ventimask
and when the decision was made to intubate for respiratory
failure after being given 2 mg IV versed. Post-intubation, the
BPs decreased to 56/28, subsequently bolused 1 L IVFs and
started on dopamine gtt at 10 mcg/kg/min with imprvement in BPs
to 129/53. He was then med-flighted into [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
In the ED, T 98.4, BP 133/72 on 7.5 mcg/kg/min dopamine, HR 114,
RR 26, O2 sat 77% on vent settings (AC 500 X 16, PEEP 5, FiO2
100%). ABG 7.27/60/48/29. The pt was noted to be biting down on
the ETT and was given 5 mg IV versed X 2. A L IJ was placed
successfully. BPs were noted to be 88/50 after 2nd push of IV
versed and dopamine was turned back up to 7.5 mcg/kg/min with BP
94/53. The pt also received a total of 1 L IVFs. He was then
transferred to the ICU for further care and management.
.
Of note, per prior OSH d/c summary, pt's baseline O2 sats in
upper 80s to low 90s.

Adult respiratory distress syndrome.

Admission CXR: Bibasilar infiltrates,  engorged pulmonary
vasculature.

[**11-21**] Echocardiography: Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], "The left atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is borderline normal. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-11-19**],
there is mild aortic stenosis and left ventricular function is
mildly depressed. No interatrial shunt is identified. Mild
estimated pulmonary artery systolic hypertension."

Brief Hospital Course:
This 77 year old gentleman with history of COPD, CAD s/p CABG,
and systolic CHF was found unresponsive at home.  He was found
to be in hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and in
septic shock with associated acute renal failure.  He underwent
central line placement and was supported with IVF and pressor
(levophed). Broad spectrum antibiotics were started. It became
apparent, with the difficulty in oxygenating the patient, that
he developed ARDS.  ARDSnet ventilation and proning maneuvers
were attempted.  Heparin was empirically started as PE could not
rule out.
The patient also, during the course, went into unstable AF with
RVR and had to be electrically cardioverted.  An amiodarone drip
was started.

The respiratory and hemodynamic status of the patient did not
significantly improve over this time.  By hospital day 6, the
family requested a meeting and believed the patient would not
have wanted these measures to be prolonged.  When the patients
closest family members had gathered, aggressive care was stopped
the patient was made comfort measures only.  With his family in
the room, Mr. [**Known lastname 31522**] passed away soon thereafter on the night
of [**2180-11-24**].
