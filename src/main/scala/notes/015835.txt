CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

1. Compared to a prior exam from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] obtained nine
hours prior, there is slight increase hemoperitoneum. Again seen
is a grade 4 laceration to the splenic hilum with active
intraparenchymal extravasation of contrast material. Given only

may be related to hypvolemia.
