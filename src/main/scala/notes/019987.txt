Atenolol / Tricor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for treatment and further evaluation of CHF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
paracentesis
Swan-ganz catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3647**] is a 71yo man with a history of atrial fibrillation/
flutter, CAD s/p PTCI, CHF EF of 45%, h/o ascites without known
liver disease, who is transferred from Lakes [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital
for further evaluation of CHF, including possible right and left
heart cath. Pt presented to OSH on [**2136-9-23**] with CHF
exacerbation after not taking his medications for three days (pt
reportedly unable to pay for the medications). He was diuresed
approx 1L. Developed acute renal failure with diuresis (crt
1.5--->2.3). Additionally, on admission to OSH, he was noted to
have increasing LE edema & ascites (which he has had in
"moderate" amounts in past, as documented by US & CT at OSH).
His LFTs were WNL (ALT 20, AST 29, alk phos 130) as they have
been in past. Despite reported h/o ascites & LE edema, pt
reportedly has no pulm HTN/RV failure on OSH imaging. Concern
raised about possible constrictive/restritive pericarditis
causing sx's. Pt was transferred for further evaluation of this.

.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt was brought directly to the floor. He
reported feeling slightly more dyspneic at rest than earlier in
day. His VS were 95/52, 94, 16, 98% on 4L nasal cannula. He
appeared uncomfortable breathing & had near tense ascites. This
was thought to be impairing his ventilation. He reported never
having had a paracentesis. The decision was made to perform
diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis. His most recent labs
from OSH were reviewed, with INR of 1.95, plt 180, crt 2.3 and
normal LFTs.
The patient underwent a 4.3L paracentesis with fluid sent for
diagnostic studies (serosanguinous fluid removed). The pt
reported some improvement in his dyspnea following the
procedure.
.
On review of systems, pt notes occasional pleuritic CP with deep
breath. Pt has significant LE edema at baseline. No orthopnea,
actually pt reports feeling better while laying flat. Decreased
exercise tolerance, particularly as his abd girth has enlarged.
He reports no yellowing of skin, light colored stool, abdominal
pain, or pruritis. No n/v. No fevers/chills. He denies any prior
history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. Cardiac review of systems is
notable for absence of palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
Of note, pt had not been taking home meds prior to presentation
to OSH since he cannot afford his to pay for his meds as he has
gone over his insurance plan's cap for medication spending.

Social History:
Married lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 3844**].  Former tracker truck
driver, now retired.  Previously heavy drinker; though has not
drank for over 15years.  No h/o tobacco use.  No IVDU.

Family History:
Mother had h/o premature coronary artery disease--had MI in her
40s.

Physical Exam:
VS - 98.8, 95/52, 94, 12, 97% on 4L
(manual BP: L arm 94/50 & R arm 92/55; pulsus of 10mmhg)
Gen: obese man, appears to be in mild distress, though answering
all questions appropriately & a&o x3.  Mood, affect appropriate.

HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Large neck. Unable to assess level of JVP due to size of
neck.
CV: IRRG, IRRG, normal S1, S2. ? 2/6 SEM. No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp
were slightly labored. Crackles anteriorly & posteriorly, though
posterior exam limited.
Abd: Distended, large amount of shifting fluid. No HSM or
tenderness.
Ext: [**12-31**]+ pitting edema b/l lower exts. Mild stasis dermatitis.

Skin: warm, dry

Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated low voltages, afib w/ average ventric response
of 100bpm, LAD, poor R wave progression, TWI in aVL & flattening
in I.  No prior to compare with.
.
Stress MIBI performed on [**6-1**] at [**Hospital3 17921**] Center
demonstrated: mild global hypokinesis, EF 45%, and no evidence
of ischemia
.
CXR (portable) [**2136-9-25**]) -- Two frontal views of the chest were
obtained.  Low lung volumes are noted.  A left retrocardiac
opacity is noted.  In addition there is a well-circumscribed
round opacity at the right base seen on one image.  The right
lung is otherwise clear.  There is prominence of the pulmonary
vasculature that is slightly indistinct with associated cephalad
re-distribution suggestive of underlying pulmonary edema.  There
is soft
tissue fullness within the AP window.  This may be exaggerated
secondary to the patient's low lung volumes however cannot
exclude underlying lymphadenopathy and/or mass.  The bony thorax
is grossly intact.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Mild pulmonary edema.
2.  Left retrocardiac opacity likely secondary to underlying
atelectasis and a small-to-moderate sized effusion, difficult to
exclude pneumonia.
3.  Fullness within the AP window concerning for underlying
lymphadenopathy. Consider CT for further evaluation.
4.  Right basilar rounded opacity.  Again this can be further
characterized with a chest CT.
.
TTE Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is >20 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %). Right ventricular
chamber size is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and moderate biventricular global hypokinesis. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
In the absence of a history of systemic hypertension, an
infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid) should be considered.
.
CARDIAC CATH:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
patent LMCA. LAD nad LCX had only mild disease. RCA had mild to
moderate
disease.
2. Left vetriculography was deferred given renal insufficiency.
3. Hemodynamic assessment revealed near equalization of the
right and
left sided filling pressures. There was no respiratory variation
in the
RA pressure or RVEDP. RA tracing had prominent X and Y descents.
There
was discordance with respirations between RV and LV pressures
consistent
with contriction.
