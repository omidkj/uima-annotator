History of Present Illness:
69yo female h/o non-Hodgkin's lymphoma c/b vasculitis w/
cryoglobulinemia, previous dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 40% up to
70%) and chronic kidney disease transferred from an OSH one day
post-op from lap cholecystectomy b/c of worsening oliguria and
continued hypoxemia.
.
She presented to [**Hospital6 7472**] [**12-5**] w/ weakness,
abdominal pain, and increased abdominal girth. She had been
discharged one day earlier after having findings c/w
cholecystitis with plans for non-urgent cholecystectomy, plans
to continue cholecystectomy. On admission she had an episode of
bradycardia thought due to a vasovagal episode, which resolved
w/o intervention. She had a newly elevated creatinine to 2.4,
thought to be prerenal. She was on the general medicine floor,
with surgery following, and continued her antibiotics (switched
to Augmentin/Flagyl), along with an aggressive bowel regimen b/c
she had not had a bowel movement for a week. Abdominal film had
shown retained barium from a week earlier. Plan was to optimize
her prior to a lap cholecystectomy.
.
[**12-11**] her respiratory status acutely worsened, and there was
concern for acute congestive heart failure. CXR showed bilateral
infiltrates, and she was given lasix with little response. Cr
rose from baseline 1.0. WBC normal and patient afebrile. A Swan
was placed, showing CVP 8 w/ wedge 12 to 15, so patient volume
resuscitated. Patient had not been intubated, but was up to 5L
NC.
.
Patient at this point had no transaminitis, but did have ongoing
RUQ pain, and repeat U/S c/w chronic cholecystitis. HIDA scan
showed no gall bladder uptake. [**12-12**] she had a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy without complication, with gallbladder appearing
"diseased, but not impressively so". She was switched to Zosyn
for antibiotic coverage. Post-op, her urine output and
oxygenation worsened, so a vasculitis work-up was started,
showing  RF>500 and low complement. Anti GBM and ANCA pending,
seen by rheumatology who recommended examining path from
gallbladder and considering a lung biopsy. Started empirically
on methylprednisolone 40mg IV Q8hrs. She was bolused fluid w/
increase in CVP up to 19, but she was still only urinating 5 to
10cc/hr. Given 80mg IV lasix prior to transfer with no
improvement. Prior to transfer, patient intubated, current 40%
FiO2, 10 of PEEP. BPs have been stable, 120 to 150s. On Zosyn
alone for gall-bladder coverage.
.
On the floor, patient intubated and sedated. Per husband, had
been having diffuse, worsening abdominal pain for several weeks
prior to admission to [**Doctor Last Name **] Dickinsen. She had been living
independently.
.
GENERAL MEDICINE FLOOR ADMISSION NOTE AFTER MICU CALL OUT
I have reviewed notes from the MICU Green Notes, Rheumatology
Consult, Nephrology Consult, Rheumatology consult. Briefly this
is a 69 year old female with history of Non-Hodgkins's Lymphoma
c/b and unclear h/o of cutaneous vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia
and chronic kidney disease, previous dilated cardiomyopathy (EF
40% up to 70%),who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**2107-12-13**] one
day post-op from lap cholecystectomy due to worsening oliguria
and continued hypoxemia, patient was intubated prior to
transfer. In the MICU patient was found to be severely volume
overloaded with minimal urine output, she did not have fevers or
leukocytosis but had been transferred on high dose steroids
(concern for vasculitides), Zosyn for antibiotics. Throughout
course patient remained afebrile, antibiotics were DC'ed.
Steroids were were only continued for the first day. In regards
to volume status, patient was diuresed with IV lasix. Patient
did not end up requiring CVVH. Upon consultation with the renal
team, patient was found to have muddy brown casts consistent
with ATN. Patient had an initial concern for vasculitides, 1st
bronch appeared to be bloody but upon second bronch and repeat
imaging there was no signs of pulmonary hemorrhage. Rheumatology
saw the patient, as the patient was found to have elevated RF
and decreased complement (which could be due to
cryoglobulinemia). ANCA,[**Known firstname **] negative. Finally, Patient had a TTE
done in the hospital, which showed preserved systolic function,
mild MR.
.
Hematology was also on board, smear not consistent with MDS.
History per outpatient Hematologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25237**]: Patient had
history of marginal zone lymphoma treated with chemo several
years ago. She also had a history of cutaenous vasculitis 8
months ago and found to have polyclonal croglobulinemia with
evidence of small amount of lymphone in marrow, she was given
chem and developed HSV and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] where she went to [**Hospital1 2025**] and was
treated. She had a vasculitic rash on her lower extremities 3
weeks ago, there was no intervention and patient improved. At
about 2 weeks ago at OSH patient had a small amount of
cryoglobullins and flow cytometry with a small number of NHL
cells. Patient reported to have baseline Cr 1.1-1.2. There was
no previous history of hypocomplimentenemia. MDS has been mostly
in her RBC line, getting procrit as outpatient.
