Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

right heart catherization
Swan-Ganz catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
49 yo M w/ h/o cardiomyopathy (EF 15-20%) s/p St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] ICD
([**2134**]), CAD s/p [**Year (4 digits) **], HTN, DM2, HLD, OSA on CPAP, CKD, and GERD,
recently admitted [**Date range (3) 67806**] for diagnostic R and L heart
Cath as part of testing for consideration for transplant, who
now p/w weakness after starting several new medications in the
last few days. Pt states that symptoms began a few days ago
while in NY.  Had some soup (with likely high salt load).  Felt
tired over the weekend.  He usually is able to climb 14 steps in
his home without SOB, but last night began to feel chest
heaviness. He placed himself on home O2, but did not sleep well
(typically sleeps vertically, but can recline with supplemental
O2.)  When he awoke, he took his AM meds, checked his FBS 71,
had his typical breakfast (bagel and yogurt), but at 11 AM began
to feel progressively weak and tired. After opening his two
stores, he became extremely exhausted, SOB, very fatigued and
weak.  He took 2 Tylenol, FBS 135.  His daughter drove him home,
where his BP 111/68 (typically SBP 80-90s).  His family then
brought him to the ED as his symptoms had not improved.
.
Upon arrival in the ED, VS 96.8, 62, 98/69, 16, 97%. He became
markedly diaphoretic and started to have a dry cough.  CXR
showed moderate pulmonary edema. Received 100 mg IV Lasix in ED,
with diuresis of 650 cc on the floor. Denies CP, arm pain, h/a,
f/n/v/d/c (diarrhea 2 weeks ago d/t virus).
.
Upon arrival to the floor, VS 97.5  62  103/76  18  96% 2LNC
Pt states he was feeling much better.
.
Wt at home has been stable (232 at home, but 238 in office
yesterday). However, he was found to have LE edema at an office
visit yesterday, and was told to increase his torsemide to 200
mg [**Hospital1 **].  He took one dose last night and a second dose this
morning, but did not feel that he was diuresing any more than
usual. Per pt, in the past he had been on torsemide and another
medication (? metolazone) but became very dehydrated as a
result.  Also he had been on po lasix 1 yr ago but this was not
effective.  However IV lasix has always worked. Medication
changes were as follows:
Medication Changes:
- Carvedilol 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] --> 3.125 mg [**Hospital1 **]
- Metronidazole started wife is has [**Name (NI) **]
- Sertraline 50 mg daily --> 100 mg daily

Married and has 3 children. Restaurant owner. 90 pack year
smoking history; quit in summer [**2135**]. Drinks on rare social
occasions. No illicits. History of diet non-compliance eating
salty Greek foods at home however has been trying to salt
restrict.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2139-2-10**]
TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The lungs are low in volume and showed
diffuse bilateral interstitial and focal airspace opacities. The
cardiac silhouette is massively enlarged. The mediastinal
silhouette and hilar contours are normal. No definite pleural
effusions are present. A left-sided pacer with its leads
terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle and coronary
sinus is unchanged compared to the previous examination.
IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary edema.
.
ABD US [**2139-2-10**]
IMPRESSION: No ascites.
.
[**2139-2-12**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %) secondary to
extensive anterior, anteroseptal, and apical akinesis, and
severe hypokinesis of all other segments except for the basal
posterior wall. The right ventricular free wall thickness is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Baseline LVOT VTI with programmed AV delay 100 msec was 10.9 cm.
After lengthening the AV delay (sensed and paced) to 200 msec,
the LVOT VTI increased to 14.9 cm.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2136-9-13**], a pacemaker/defibrillator wire is now seen in
the right heart. Tricuspid regurgitation is increased. Left
ventricular systolic function remains profoundly reduced.
Reprogramming CRT settings as described above resulted in
improved stroke volume.
