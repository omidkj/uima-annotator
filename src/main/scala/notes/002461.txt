HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 55-year-old female
with a history of multiple ventral hernia repairs, the latest
being on [**2199-6-15**], who presents to the Emergency Room
today with diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and fever.  Her
abdominal wound was opened secondary to intermittent
serous drainage and mild scattered erythema.  She was put on
Keflex followed by levaquin and the erythema resolved.  At
present, she has no complaints of chest or abdominal pain.
Patient has also had some loose stoo since last night.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Goiter.
3. Obesity.
4. Asthma.
5. Fibromyalgia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Multiple mesh ventral hernia repairs, last one being [**2199-6-15**], with prior panniculectomy.
2. Cesarean section x2.
3. Right salpingo-oophorectomy.
4. Liver hemangioma resection.
5. Left breast biopsy.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Synthroid.
2. Diovan.
3. Calcium.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature is 99.8,
blood pressure is 85/52, pulse is 96, respiratory rate is 14.
Her heart examination is regular, rate, and rhythm with no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Her lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft with mild to moderate
right upper quadrant tenderness distinct from her incisional
wound on the right mid abdomen.  She is obese.  Positive bowel
sounds in all four quadrants.  Rectal examination is guaiac
negative. Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count was 23.5, hematocrit
33.9, platelets 268.  Sodium 137, potassium 3.6, chloride
100, bicarbonate 23, BUN 21, creatinine 1.0, glucose of 138.
After Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] noted her to be icteric, LFTs were obtained
(below) and found elevated.

Chest x-ray was negative.

CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a stable appearance
of a fatty infiltrated liver with no abscesses in either the
peritoneal cavity or the abdominal wall. It also showed some
stranding and soft tissue thickening adjacent to the skin
defect in the right anterior abdominal wall without any
associated abscess.  There is some evidence of diverticulosis
and inguinal hernia on the right that was nonobstructive.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the floor for apparent
sepsis without any localizing source.  She was given empiric
levofloxacin and Flagyl antibiotics.  She was kept NPO and
was aggressively rehydrated.

On hospital day one, [**2199-8-13**], patient was admitted to the
SICU with hypotension of 70s-80s systolic blood pressure.

On hospital day one, the patient was transferred from the
floor to SICU with hypotension.  Patient has had chronic
right upper quadrant abdominal wound for multiple hernia
repairs.  She denied any chest pain, shortness of breath,
cough, congestion, or any blood in her bowel movements.  She
also denies any stiff neck, photophobia, rash, numbness,
weakness, or tingling.  She also denies any dysuria,
hematuria, or frequency.

On admission to the SICU, the patient was hypotension with
minimal response with fluids.  She is on levofloxacin and
Flagyl.  Vancomycin was added on the day of admission to the
SICU.  Her laboratories prior to admission to the SICU was
white blood cell count of 23.5, hematocrit of 33.9, platelets
268.  Chem-7 was normal.  Urinalysis was preliminarily
negative.  AST 86, ALT 89, LDH 229, alkaline phosphatase 76,
total bilirubin 3.8, amylase 47, ESR of 75 with a C-reactive
protein of 29.

While in the SICU, patient received an arterial line.  Also
received a left subclavian central venous line.  Infectious
Disease was consulted and requested hepatitis serology as
well as blood and stool cultures which were sent.  While in
the SICU, a PA catheter was inserted.  The patient was
treated with Levophed with good response.  Patient's levo was
weaned off with approximately 12 hours.  Patient continued to
be treated with Levaquin, Flagyl, and Vancomycin.  An
echocardiogram was negative for any vegetations.  Patient was
ruled out for myocardial infarction by electrocardiogram and
cardiac enzymes.  She had a liver and a gallbladder
ultrasound done on [**8-14**] that was negative.

She had intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation and
flutter that was self limiting.  She was treated with
Lopressor and transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
Electrolytes were repleted.  Patient was transferred to the
floor on hospital day three.

Upon transfer to the floor, patient's LFTs were AST 108, ALT
139, alkaline phosphatase 124, total bilirubin of 4.1 with a
direct bilirubin of 2.7.  GI was consulted.  They suggested that
the LFT pattern was suggestive of sepsis of unknown etiology.
The surgical service felt that an episode of self-limiting
cholangitis, given the RUQ pain, unclear source of sepsis, and
previous major liver resection, was equally plausible.
Hepatitis panels were drawn and were all negative.  In
addition, an MRI cholangiogram was normal.  Stool cultures were
all negative.

While on the floor, the patient was advanced from NPO to a
regular diet as tolerated.  The patient was able to tolerate
regular food without difficulty.  The patient was out of bed
and ambulating.  She had no complaints of pain and was
afebrile.  She had no other episodes of hypotension.  Her
LFTs and white blood cell count continued to trend downward.
White blood cell count on the day of discharge was down to
10.7.  Her last Chem-7 on the day prior to discharge was a
sodium of 143 potassium 4.1, chloride 108, bicarb of 29, BUN
of 8, creatinine of 0.5, and a glucose of 110.  LFTs showed
an ALT of 36, and AST of 23, alkaline phosphatase of 78,
amylase 42, and total bilirubin of 0.8.

Patient's abdominal wound continued to be changed twice a day
on the floor with Dakin solution.  On the day of discharge,
the wound is clean, dry, and intact without any evidence of
erythema.  The patient was discharged home on a seven day
course of Flagyl and levofloxacin.
