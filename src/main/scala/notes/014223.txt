Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 72009**] is a 75 year old female with COPD (on O2 at home)
and schizophrenia who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 2177**] to the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. At the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] the patient had an
aspiration event and was found to be hypoxic to the 60's. She
was placed on a NRB and taken to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where she was found to
be extremely labored and congested. She was suctioned and also
noted to be in rate-controlled a-flutter. She appeared fatigued
and was intubated. She had received steroids since at least [**2-16**]
when she was discharged from [**Hospital1 2177**].
.
She was not started on antibiotics in the ICU. Bronchoscopy
showed white food particles in the RLL. She continued to have
episodes of a-flutter while being intubated. She was quickly
extubated without complication. She was treated as aspiration
pneumonitis. She was started on steroids, with the plan for a
[**2-23**] day taper, and transferred to the floor. She was also found
to have a + UA. She was started on Cipro initially, but the
culture eventually demonstrated FQ resistant E. coli so the
patient was switched to Keflex for a 7 day course. Subsequent
UA/culture demonstrated yeast, thus she was given a 3 day course
of fluconazole.
.
On the day of anticipated discharge, the patient was found on
the bathroom floor with a new ecchymosis on her forehead. CT
head was negative. EKG demonstrated that the patient was in
a-fib with RVR, she was given a small dose of beta-blocker which
caused bradycardia into the 30s. She remained hemodynamically
stable, but all beta-blockers were subsequently held. She
subsequently remained in rate-controlled a-fib versus a-flutter
with variable block with diltiazem only. EP was consulted but
felt that the patient was not a candidate for cardioversion or
ablation given the requirement for post-procedural
anti-coagulation and the patient's concurrent risk of falling.
.
On [**2136-2-29**], the patient had an elevated HCO3 and was
significantly more lethargic. ABG was as follows: 7.41/88/98/58.
Pulmonary consult and respiratory therapy were called to
initiate BiPAP given the concern for CO2 retention and risk of
hypercapnic respiratory failure. She was also started on
Solu-Medrol 80 IV q8h for presumptive worsening of aspiration
pneumonitis. Approximately 1.5 hours after being placed on BiPAP
with 2L O2, the patient was noted to have an O2 sat in the low
80s. It rose slowly to the low 90s when increased to 4L O2.
Albuterol neb treatment was attempted, but the patient dropped
to the high 70s. She recovered to an O2 sat of 90s after being
placed on 4L O2 by nasal cannula. She was transferred to the
MICU for closer monitoring given her respiratory instability and
lethargy. In the MICU, she remained stable on nasal oxygen.
High-dose steroid therapy was continued. She was subsequently
transferred back to the floor. It is possible that she was
over-ventilated in the setting of COPD. She was discharged with
instructions for a slow steroid taper.
.
Clonidine and diltiazem were continued for hypertension. This
patient should not receive beta-blockers in the future as she
was very sensitive to a low dose. For her schizophrenia, the
patient was maintained on Haldol per her outpatient regimen. She
had no symptoms of psychosis on this admission.
