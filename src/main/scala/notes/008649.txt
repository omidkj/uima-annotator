DIAGNOSIS:  Esophageal perforation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 74-year-old
woman who presented on [**2167-12-8**] in the Emergency
Department at an outside hospital and was transferred to the
Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 **] Hospital.  She
was previously well, but has a history of esophageal
strictures that had previously been dilated.  Her
gastroenterologist was a physician at the peripheral
hospital.  Her last esophageal dilatation was approximately
one year prior.  The evening of [**2167-12-8**], she was
having dinner when a piece of chicken pot pie got caught in
her throat.  She felt like it was obstructed distally and
attempted to cough to expel the food particle.  Eventually,
she managed to cough the morsel of dinner out, but
experienced excruciating pain at the same time.
Subsequently, she vomited several times and noted bright red
blood in her vomitus.  The pain subsided a little, and she
noted that it radiated to her back and flank.  Subsequently,
the pain remained constant, and she vomited a total of 8
times prior to presenting at the Emergency Department.

She denied any chest pain or shortness of breath,
diaphoresis, fever.  She had no similar experience in the
past.

At the peripheral hospital, she had a work-up which
ultimately showed a CT scan suggesting a ruptured esophagus.
She was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 **]
Hospital for acute management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Asthma.
2. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
3. Esophageal strictures.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Esophageal dilatations.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Advair.
2. Albuterol.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denies smoking any tobacco, nor drinking
any alcohol.  She lives at home with her husband.

EXAM:  She appeared in moderate distress when seen in the
Emergency Department.  She remained afebrile with a
temperature of 98.8??????F, pulse 82, respiratory rate 26, blood
pressure 115/54, with an oxygen saturation of 96% on 2 liters
of nasal cannula.  Her abdomen was nontender to palpation,
with normal bowel sounds, and no peritoneal symptoms.  She
had clear lung fields throughout.  She had a regular pulse
with normal heart sounds.  She had good peripheral
circulation with warm extremities and good pulses.  She was
grossly neurologically intact.

COURSE IN HOSPITAL:  She was admitted and seen in the
Emergency Department at the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2167-12-8**].  Her labs were within normal limits except for an
elevated white count of 21.  Chest x-ray had shown a small
right pleural effusion.  A CT chest showed, again, the right
small pleural effusion with contrast extravasation of air
into the periesophageal tissues.

She was urgently taken to the operating room for repair of
the esophageal rupture.  She was taken to the OR for
thoracotomy and exploration of the esophagus.  She was
primarily repaired in the OR and received a G-tube, J-tube,
and a JP, as well as a chest tube.  Postoperatively, she
received an epidural for pain management.

Postoperatively, she did well and recovered slowly in the
Critical Care Unit.  She was extubated postoperatively with
no complications.  On postop day #2, she was transferred to
the floor for further management.  She had a low-grade
temperature of 100.3??????F, with remaining vital signs stable.
That same day, she was started on tube feeds with the J-tube.
Initially, she had some nausea with the starting of the tube
feeds, but tolerated it well eventually.  Her course in
hospital remained uneventful.

Subsequently, her chest tube was removed without
complications, as well as the NG tube.  She started drinking
clear fluids and tolerated that with no problems.  The JP was
left in place due to moderate drainage.  She was seen by
physiotherapy and was able to move to a chair.  She is
currently stable.

Her G-tube can be capped when the patient is able to
ambulate.  The JP is to remain in place until follow-up for
removal.  She will require further physiotherapy to help
regain her strength until she is able to return to her
baseline.  Tube feeds are currently at 80 cc/h.  Her G-tube
is currently on a trial of clamping.  It should continue to
be clamped for 4 hours, and then opened to note the amount of
drainage.  She is currently stable for discharge to
rehabilitation.
