Date of Birth:   [**2028-5-12**]       Sex:  F

Service:  GOLD SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
female who was recently diagnosed in [**2104-11-1**] with
metastatic ovarian carcinoma for which she underwent a
debulking surgery, total abdominal hysterectomy, omentectomy,
sigmoid colon resection, and colostomy.  This was done at an
outside hospital.  Her postoperative course was complicated
by urinary tract infection.  She did well until [**2104-12-2**]
when she spiked a temperature and subsequently developed
................. sepsis.  She required to be intubated and
was hemodynamically unstable requiring pressors.  At this
point, she was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux
disease, breast cancer status post left lumpectomy in [**2093**],
ovarian cancer diagnosed [**2104-11-1**] status post debulking
surgery, hypercholesterolemia, status post appendectomy,
history of shingles.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She came to this hospital on [**2104-12-24**], at which point she was febrile, hemostasis unstable,
intubated, and on pressors.  An initial surgical consult was
sought as cholecystitis was a possible source of her sepsis.
She underwent an ultrasound which showed a normal
gallbladder.  She was initially admitted to the Medical
Service in MICU.  She remained intubated and unstable and had
repeated drops in her hematocrit despite multiple
transfusions.  She underwent her first EGD on [**12-26**]
which revealed grade II esophagitis, gastritis, and an ulcer
in the anterior aspect of the first part of the duodenum.
She was treated with H2 blockers for ulcer.  She was also on
broad spectrum antibiotics for her sepsis.  A chest x-ray
revealed bilateral lung infiltrates, and pneumonia was
diagnosed on the basis of this.

Subsequently she continued to drop her hematocrit despite
repeated transfusions.  She had several further EGDs, one on
[**1-2**], [**1-4**], and on [**1-5**].  Each of these
EGDs revealed healing esophagitis and blood in the antrum and
body of the stomach and a large clot in the bowel of the
duodenum with no active source identified.  EGD done on
[**1-5**], showed a single oozing ulcer noted in the
anterior bowel of the duodenum which was about 2-3 cm in
size.  This was injected with epinephrine, and she also
received BIPAP treatment; however, the oozing still
continued.  On [**1-7**], she underwent repeat EGD which
showed a fungating ulcerative bleeding mass distal to the
duodenal bulb.

As the patient continued to have a transfusion requirement,
Surgery was reconsulted for management of this bleeding
duodenal mass.  She went to the Operating Room on [**1-11**].  She underwent an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of
adhesions, and duodenotomy was performed.  The duodenal ulcer
was oversewn, and a pyloroplasty was done.  Subsequently her
transfusion requirement stopped, and her hematocrit
stabilized.

Over the course of her Intensive Care Unit stay, she
developed MRSA sepsis followed by VRE sepsis and fungemia for
which she received appropriate treatment.  She had bilateral
pleural effusions, right worse than left.  She received an
initial CT-guided pigtail insertion in the right pleural
space.  Subsequently she was noted to have loculated pleural
effusions, again worse on the right side.  This was a
presumed malignant effusion.  She underwent two sessions of
pleurodesis for the same.  This was around the middle of
[**Month (only) 956**].

Her Intensive Care Unit stay was further complicated by rapid
onset of atrial fibrillation for which she received
Amiodarone.  Her Intensive Care Unit stay was further
complicated by a right groin pseudoaneurysm for which she
received Interventional Radiology guided thrombin injection.

Her prolonged complicated Intensive Care Unit stay resulted
in ventilator dependence and the inability to wean off the
vent.  She received a tracheostomy on [**1-21**].  She also
underwent a CT scan of her head in early [**Month (only) 958**] for persistent
mental status changes.  The CT scan was negative.

Subsequently the during the first two weeks of [**Month (only) 958**], she had
a more stable course.  She remained hemodynamically stable.
Her vent support was gradually but slowly decreased.  She did
not have any further infective issues and has remained off
antibiotics.  She has remained hemodynamically stable.  She
has been tolerating enteral feeds via a postpyloric feeding
tube.  Her stoma has been functioning, and she has been
putting out good stools every day.  She has been making good
urine, and there are no issues with renal function at
present.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Metastatic ovarian carcinoma status post debulking
surgery.
2.  Total abdominal hysterectomy, omentectomy, sigmoid
resection with end colostomy.
3.  Bleeding duodenal ulcer and fungal duodenal mass status
post exploratory laparotomy and oversewing of duodenal ulcer
and pyloroplasty.
4.  Status post Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus sepsis,
fungemia, and Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus
sepsis.
5.  Malignant pleural effusions status post pleurodesis times
two.
6.  Right groin pseudoaneurysm status post injection of
thrombin.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is currently has a
tracheostomy tube in place.  She has a postpyloric feeding
tube in place.  She is hemodynamically stable, afebrile, not
on any antibiotics, tolerating her enteral feeds, and is with
good renal function.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to vent rehabilitation.
