[**2138-11-3**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
three
vessel coronary disease. The LMCA was short and without
significant
disease. The LAD had 2 serial 70% stenoses proximal and
mid-segment with
a 90% ostial D1 stenosis as well. The LCX had a 99% stenosis at
the
previous POBA site. The RCA had a 90% stenosis in the
mid-segment.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated systemic
arterial
pressure with an SBP of 148 mm Hg. The LVEDP was elevated at 20
mm Hg.
There was no aortic stenosis will pullback across the aortic
valve.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
[**2138-11-3**] Carotid U/S
1. Patent right internal carotid artery stent with no evidence
of stenosis.
2. 60-69% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
 [**2138-11-4**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with inferior, inferolateral and lateral
akinesis. The remaining segments contract normally. Quantitative
(biplane) LVEF = 31%. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation.

[**2138-11-8**] CTA
1. Right lower extremity: Thrombosis of the right external iliac
artery at
its origin at the level of the bifurcation of the right common
iliac artery. The right common femoral artery reconstitutes via
collateral branches from the right obturator artery, and deep
iliac circulflex arteries. Multifocal atherosclerotic disease is
seen in the widely patent right common femoral, superficial
femoral and popliteal arteries. There is one vessel runoff to
the right foot via the diminutive right posterior tibial artery.

2. Left lower extremity: Multifocal atherosclerotic disease is
seen
throughout the left iliac arterial system, left common femoral,
superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. These vessels remain
widely patent. There is one vessel runoff to the left foot via
the left posterior tibial artery.
3. Note is made of bilateral renal artery stents. The kidneys
enhance
symmetrically, implying patency of the stents.

[**2138-11-5**] Chest CTA
Minimal centrilobular emphysema.
No lung nodule identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2138-11-3**] for a cardiac
catheterization. As this revealed severe three vessel disease,
the cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical
revascularization. He was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed a
patent right and a  60-69% stenosis of the left internal carotid
artery. There was a question of a lung nodule on chest x-ray
however a follow-up CT scan showed no evidence of any lung
nodules.

On [**2138-11-7**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels.
Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively he was
taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring.

On postoperative day one, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. On postoperative day one he complained of pain and
his right leg pulses were absent and a vascular surgery consult
was obtained. A CTA of his aorta and lower extremities was
performed which showed a thrombosed right external iliac artery
from its origin at the bifurcation of the right common iliac
artery. He was taken to the operating room where he underwent
exploration of right groin with thrombectomy of right iliac
artery followed by angiogram and stenting of right common into
the external iliac artery, bovine patch angioplasty of common
femoral artery. Postoperatively he was returned to the intensive
care unit. Bicarbonate was administered for 6 hours following
his surgery to prevent acidosis.

He did well and was transferred to the step down unit on
[**2138-11-11**] for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards
his preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. By post-operative day 6 he was ready for discharge to
home with physical therapy.
