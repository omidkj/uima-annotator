Pertinent Results:
[**2105-4-16**] Echo: PREBYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. There is mild to moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.9-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
POSTBYPASS: LV systolic function is slightly improved
(LVEF~45%). RV systolic function is preserved. There is a well
seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position.
No AI is visualized. The study is otherwise unchanged from the
prebypass study.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 56442**] was a same day admit after undergoing all preoperative
work-up following his cardiac cath on [**2105-4-9**]. On [**4-16**] he was
brought directly to the operating room where he underwent an
aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft x 1.
Please see operative report for surgical details. He tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred in critical but stable
condition to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours
he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and
extubated. He subsequently developed rhythm issues with
Nonsustained VTach, A Fib, and AV nodal disease. EP was
consulted and he is rate-controlled with beta blockade.
Anticoagulation was initiated with Coumadin,INR goal of 2.0-2.5
for atrial fibrillation. he remained in the CVICU for closer
observation of his rhythm as well as postoperative ATN. Renal
was consulted. Diuresis was limited. Mr.[**Known lastname 86395**] BUN/Cr continued
to trend down without any intervention. POD# 5 his INR increased
to 13 after 2 doses of Coumadin (5mg/2mg) having been bolused
with Amio. He was reversed with Vitamin K/FFP. POD# 6 he was
transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility. His rhythm remained stable in paroxysmal AFib. He
continued to progress. POD# 7 he was cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]
for discharge to Life care Rehabilitation in [**Location (un) 86396**].
All follow up appointments were advised.
