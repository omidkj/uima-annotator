History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 yo F who p/w to OSH with chest pain that began
suddenly, [**8-8**] SSCP not relieved by 2 nitroglycerin. Pt has
recently had several social stressors and has noticed more
frequent dyspnea on exertion and increased fatigue. Last night,
after drinking two margaritas, she went to bed and shortly
thereafter felt substernal chest pain that was "heavy" and
radiating down her left arm. + associated SOB and diaphoresis.
She took a 3rd nitro with some relief. She says she has not had
this pain since she last had chest pain in [**2172**]. She reports
that in the ambulance to the OSH she had a HR to 140's and was
in a.fib, but it resolved on its own as the chest pain resolved.
At [**Hospital6 10353**], the patient had an unremarkable EKG
but troponin's peaked at 2.81. She was started on integrillin
and heparin drips (not given plavix).
.
Per her request, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization.
.
Upon arrival, she was without chest pain or dyspnea. She was
still on the heparin drip but not the integrillin drip. No c/o
at this time.
.

[**2-19**] Cath report: Coronary Angiography: was performed in
multiple projections using a 5 French JL4 and a 5 French JR4
catheter, with manual contrast injections. Percutaneous coronary
revascularization was performed using placement of drug-eluting
stent(s) to mid-LAD.

.
[**2-19**] CT abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION: Large left retroperitoneal
hematoma extends from just below the iliac crest to the left
groin. High-density material surrounding the left common femoral
artery and vein in the groin suggests possible active bleeding
at this site.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo caucasian F with 2 vessel CAD s/p recent NSTEMI (cath on
[**2194-2-19**] with DES to LAD), h/o MI in [**11-1**] with stenting of OM1,
IDDM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia who is being transferred to the
CCU with a 10x11 cm RP bleed. Pt noted new onset back pain and
dizziness post cath with SBP in the 90's.
.
Pt was initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from an [**Hospital3 13347**] on [**2194-2-16**] for cardiac catheterization following
increasing episodes of sub-sternal CP radiating to her arm,
dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and diaphoresis. On admission,
troponin elevated to 2.8. ECG without ST-T changes (old T wave
inversions were noted in V1-V4). She was loaded with plavix and
continued on ASA, beta blocker, [**Last Name (un) **], and Lipitor. Her cath was
initially scheduled for [**2-18**], however, was postponed until today
secondary to inadvertent overdosing of integrellin. She was
noted to have mild bleeding of skin scabs and oral mucosa which
has since resolved.
.
Cath revealed a 100% occlusion of LAD after septals, patent OM1,
99% small OM2, and RCA with 100% after RV marginals with
placement of Cypher stent to LAD (0% residual). [**Name (NI) 1917**],
pt reported [**7-8**] back pain, nausea, and diaphoresis. SBP dropped
to the 70's with a HR in the 40's-50's. Her blood sugar was 66.
She had oozing from her L groin site. She was given 1.5L of
fluids with recovery of SBP to the 100-120's and resolution of
her symptoms. A CT scan showed a 10x11cm retroperitoneal bleed.
She was typed and crossed. A vascular surgery consult was
requested, and she was transferred to the CCU for observation
.
She remained hemodynamically stable in the CCU, HCT
41.9->32->42.1 s/p 2 uPRBC's. Repeat abdomen/pelvis CT done
showing stabilization of hematoma. Vascular surgery followed,
but no intervention was necessary.
.
She was transferred back to the floor on [**2-20**] as she remained
hemodynamically stable.
.
She was restarted on atenolol 25mg daily prior to discharge. She
should f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7389**] next week. She should f/u with her PCP
for diabetes management.
