History of Present Illness:
Patient very lethargic, he was able to provide some history but

Mr. [**Known lastname 17315**] is a 67 y/o man with PMH Addison's disease (on
Prednisone) and bilateral subdural hygromas noted on head CT
after MVA in [**2134-8-22**], who developed acute onset of [**10-31**]
headache yesterday. He says he was just sitting, no exertion,
when headache started acutely. Initially took some Ibuprofen
prescrbed by the PCP which helped, but later on had headache
again with gait unsteadiness and dizziness. No recent head
trauma
(did have head trauma from MVA in [**2134-8-22**]). He says he feels
extremely fatigued with generalized weakness, but no other
symptoms. While in ED, he was initially noted to be alert and
responsive; however, when I first saw him, he was lethargic and
this was noted to be a change according to ED staff.

took ibuprofen which relieved his h/a temporarly, but headache
reoccurred with dizziness and gait unsteadiness. Upon
examination in ED, patient was observed to be very lethargic,
head CT revealed bilateral chronic subdural hematomas and
patient was taken to OR emergently for bilateral burr holes for
evacuation of hygromas. He was transfered to the ICU post

remained stable.
