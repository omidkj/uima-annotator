Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80 year old Hispanic
female who has known heart disease and was watching
television on the day of admission when she felt substernal
chest pressure that progressed to a gurgling sensation in her
throat.  Her daughter called 911 and she was treated with
Nitroglycerin and Lasix and then morphine.  She was
diaphoretic and had improved symptoms in the Emergency Room
but on presentation her blood pressure was labile.  She was
given Lopressor and Nitroglycerin in the Emergency Room and
then she was admitted.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a normal stress test
in [**2151-1-2**].  She had an echocardiogram in [**2152-12-2**] which showed an ejection fraction of 55 percent and 2+
mitral regurgitation.  She has a history of hypertension.
She is status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2148**].  She
still has a history of hypothyroidism and dysphagia.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o.
q. day, Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q. day which was discontinued
prior to admission.  Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day, Ecotrin
one p.o. q. day, Zoloft, Levoxyl 0.025 mg p.o. q. day and
Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q. day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke cigarettes.  She does not
drink alcohol.  She lives with her two daughters.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination she is an
elderly white female with dyspnea.  Her temperature is 99,
heart rate 109, blood pressure 150/77, oxygen saturation 3
liters on 97 percent.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination, normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular movements
intact, oropharynx benign.  Neck was supple, full range of
motion, no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids were 2+
and equal bilaterally without bruits.  She had jugulovenous
pressure of about 9 cm.  Her lungs had bibasilar crackles.
Her cardiovascular examination had a regular rate and rhythm
with III/VI holosystolic murmur.  Abdomen was soft, nontender
with positive bowel sounds, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities were without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  She was admitted and had an echocardiogram
which showed a normal ejection fraction, left ventricular
hypertrophy and a partial flail leaflet of her mitral valve
with 2+ mitral regurgitation and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation
and severe mitral valve prolapse.  She was started on
intravenous Nitroglycerin and her ACE was restarted.  At that
she was made Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate.  She also
had an increased creatinine up to 2.  She was intermittently
aggressively diuresed.  She was given inhalers.  She
continued to be very short of breath.  As she was diuresed
her BUN and creatinine rose.  She also had intermittent
supraventricular tachycardia with some ventricular
tachycardia and was started on Cardizem.  She had
intermittent days where she would have symptomatic
improvement.  On [**2153-6-12**], she underwent a cardiac
catheterization which revealed the left ventricle showed 4+
mitral regurgitation and a hyperdynamic left ventricle.  Her
coronaries revealed mild plaquing of the left main and
minimal plaquing of the left anterior descending coronary
artery and circumflex coronary artery and a 30 percent plaque
of the right coronary artery.  Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was consulted
and the patient's creatinine continued to rise.  She also had
a Proteus urinary tract infection that was being treated and
she was also seen by Neurology who cleared her for surgery.
Her pulmonary status did begin to improve, and she became
acutely shortness of breath on [**6-16**], requiring intubation
and a balloon pump, and on [**6-18**], the patient underwent a
mitral valve repair with a 26 mm [**Doctor Last Name **] anuloplasty band.
She was sent to the CSRU on Milrinone and Neo.  She still had
her balloon in.  She had a stable postoperative night except
she was slow to wake up.  She was discontinued from all
sedation.  On postoperative day #2, she continued to have
intermittent agitation with lethargy.  She was seen by
Neurology.  She also did not move her right arm at first but
then was removing it but it was considerably weaker, so they
felt that she had had a cerebrovascular accident.  Her
original computerized tomography scan did not show this.  She
continued to improve.  Her balloon and her chest tubes were
discontinued on postoperative day #4.  She did continue to
improve neurologically-wise.  She did have an magnetic
resonance imaging on postoperative day #3 which revealed
multiple small cerebral infarcts which were in the Watershed
distribution.  She also went in and out of atrial
fibrillation and was anticoagulated.  She continued to
improve but she did again become shortness of breath and had
bilateral pleural effusions and on postoperative day #9, she
had a right chest tube placed and 1100 cc was obtained and
she had a left chest tube placed.  So, she had improved from
this standpoint and these were eventually removed and she was
effectively diuresing.  On postoperative day #11 she was
transferred to the floor in stable condition.  She continued
on a stable postoperative course and on postoperative day #16
she was discharged to rehabilitation.

Her laboratory data on discharge are hematocrit 35.5, white
count 8,100, platelets 439, sodium 142, potassium 4.8,
chloride 108, carbon dioxide 26, BUN 27, creatinine 1.5,
blood sugar 92, PT 17.4, INR 2.

1. Levoxyl 25 mcg p.o. q. day.
2. Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day.
3. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
4. Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q. day.
5. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. q. day.
