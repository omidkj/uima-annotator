History of Present Illness:
65M with alcoholic focal pancreatitis in [**2143**] with
suspicious vessel invasion, atypical cytology with distal CBD
stricture, sphincterotomy and wallstent placement [**4-/2143**] with
last ERCP [**11-16**] for stent occlusion admitted to [**Hospital3 **]
with Increased LFTs, abdominal pain, nausea/vomitting, chills,
and BCx growing strep (?pneumonia). Has had four
hospitalizations
for acute pancreatitis. Seen by surgery Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] in past and
thought not to be a surgical candidate for pancreas based on CT
findings.

Pt was on low dose dopamine in the ICU, new onset of Afib.
Transferred on lovenox and clears from [**Hospital1 **]

ABD: SOFT, NT, ND
EXT: No edema


Pertinent Results:
CT TORSO [**2148-1-22**]:
1. Bilateral multifocal ground glass opacity which appears new
from same day chest radiograph. Differential diagnosis includes
pulmonary edema, atypical infection, or aspiration.
2. Biliary dilatation in the context of a metal stent. There are
also
multiple discrete hypoattenuating lesions within the liver
parenchyma. These appear new when compared to [**2144-1-13**].
Interestingly, extensive peripancreatic soft tissue abnormality
present that has mostly resolved.

There are no focal bone lesions. The [**Hospital 228**] medical history
is reviewed. The fact that the patient originally presented in
[**2143**] with pancreatic abnormalities and there has been no
progression of disease would argue against the diagnosis of
pancreatic adenocarcinoma. As such, given the presence of
cholangitis, the discrete hypoattenuating lesions in the left
lobe of the liver could represent small microabscesses.
Continued attention on followup is recommended. At 11 mm, they
are small too percutaneously sample especially given their high
dome location.

ERCP [**2148-1-24**]:
IMPRESSION: Metal stent removed from the CBD. No significant
intrahepatic
ductal dilatation. A plastic stent was placed. For more
details/recommendations please see the Gastroenterology report
in Careweb from the same date.

XRay L ankle [**2148-1-27**]:
IMPRESSION: Diffuse abnormalities which could reflect Charcot
foot related to a systemic neuropathy or could potentially be
the sequelae of old injury with secondary arthritic changes. No
definite superimposed acute fracture is identified, but a subtle
injury would be difficult to detect given the diffuse
abnormalities. With this in mind, correlation with any previous
outside radiographs would be helpful to assess for interval
change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7631**] was transferred from an OSH on [**2148-1-22**]. He was
admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 2829**] service in the SICU. He was awake and
responsive, placed on IV abx, and made NPO with IVF. A CT of his
torso was obtained, which was consistent with ascending
cholangitis and pneumonia. A GI consult was obtained for ERCP.

Hypoxia:
On HD 1, the patient had labored breathting and became hypoxic.
He was intubated for impending repiratory failure. He was
extubated on HD 5. He was transferred from the SICU to the
general floor on HD 6.

Aspiration:
While advancing his diet, it was noted that he would cough with
consumption of thin liquids. A speech and swallow eval was
obtained who recommended 1:1 monitoring and small amounts of
thin liquids. Otherwise, he was tolerating a regular diet prior
to discharge.

Ascending Cholangitis:
On HD 3 and ERCP was performed and old metal stent was removed
from the CBD. A new plastis stent was placed. The patient
tolerated the procedure well.

Atrial Fibrillation:
On HD 4, the patient went into atrial fibrillation and he was
rate controlled medically. He was subsequently cardioverted in
the SICU by the cardiology service that day. He returned into
a-fib rhythm on HD 5. An attempt to medically cardiovert/rate
control him with amioadarone and diltiazem in the SICU. He again
converted to NSR. He again went into a-fib on HD 7 and was seen
again on the floor by Cardiology who recommended using 50mg
metoprolol q8hrs and increasing ammounts as tolerated for
tachycardia providing his BP is stable. Diltiazem was d/c'd and
amiodarone continued. They also recommmened anticoagulation with
coumadin. However, given his upcoming operation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
on [**2-8**], it was decided to hold coumadin and anti-coagulate the
patient with heparin or lovenox. Pt intermittenly in a-fib, rate
controlled with moteprolol.

Left Ankle Pain / Poor ambulation:
The patient has a history of Charcot arthropathy, and developed
worsening ankle pain on HD 6. An ankle xray was performed
showing chronic changes withouth evidence of accute injury. He
was seen for fitting of an ankle brace by NOPCO, but he refused
the brace. He ambulated with PT on HD 10, but was deemed a poor
candidate for self care at home based on his unsteady gate and
assist requirements.

The patient was discharged to a rehab facility on [**2148-2-1**].
