Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
hypercarbic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation [**2101-11-1**]
A line insertion [**2101-11-2**]
PICC line [**2101-11-2**]

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F w/hx of COPD on 2L at baseline for last day has had increase
O2 requirement. Per husband/rehab has increased O2 requirement
over the last day. Coughing decreased from COPD baseline. Yest
was hypoxic and NC uptitrated to 5L. This AM requiring NRB (sats
and circumstances unclear). [**Name2 (NI) **] has been afebrile but has
had increasing LE edema.

Per husbands report, had not been on home O2 for COPD until
placed in rehab in [**Month (only) 205**]. Had been living at home and very
functional until recent admission in [**Month (only) 205**] for N/V/Abd
distension. Had a laparotomy and appendix taken and out R
femoral hernia repaired. D/ced to rehab and has been there
since. Husband reports that roughly a week ago she had a
worsening cough and he thought she had developed bronchitis.
From the rehab charts it appears she was put on a prednisone
taper and azithromycin. He reports she had been improving with
these treatments until the last 2 days, although his history of
her worsening is very unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] ED signout from talking to
the nursing home she was more hypoxic yesterday requiring 5L NC
and being placed on a NRB this AM. He reports she was
complaining of no other symptoms but is unclear if there was any
change in her mental status.

He reports that at home baseline before rehab she was able to
talk roughly 50yds before being limited by shortness of breath.
She did all the chores, cooking, and cleaning at the house per
his report and they went out together 3x/week. Since her
admission to the hospital and discharge to rehab, he reports she
had not done as well, but again his history is somewhat unclear.

ED Course, presented with Temp 98.4, HR 96, BP 118/54, RR 44,
Sats 100% on NRB. Altered here, A&O x 1, husband (also in 90s)
says she is fine at rehab baseline. Rales bilateral bases with
JVD at mandible. CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions with
infiltrated on RLQ and concern for aspiration. WBC elevated to
17.3 (89% PMNs without bands, Bcx drawn, and started on
vanco/zosyn. EKG: NSR at 94, NA/NI, No ST elevations. Given
combivent trial with 125mg IV methlyprednisone. Initial Chem 7
with HCO3 of 42, BNP of 1700. Initial VBG on NRB showed 7.23 /
112 / 55 / 49. Trialed on BiPAP with ABG showing 7.18 / 138 /
209 / 54. Pt wasn't tolerating BiPAP and kept taking off. Resp
rate high but other VSS. ED called PCP and daughter as pt had
DNR order but no DNI order and husband wanting everything done.
Daughter and PCP decided to intubate and see how things go with
thought that would withdraw care if dosen't recover. Easy
intubation. Intubated with succinylcholine and propofol. After
intubation and propofol BPs dropped to 80s/60s, given 1L NS and
switched to Midazolam and Fentanyl. Did not require pressors and
BPs came up to 110-120s. No CVL placed (2 PIV). Yellowish fluid
from lungs after intubation (unclear when was aspirating - with
intubation vs yest).

VS on ICU arrival now: Afebrile, BP 106/51, HR 81, RR 20, 98% on
100% FiO2 on Vent. Pt unable to respond to questioning and so no
ROS could be obtained.

IMAGING:
[**2101-11-1**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Limited study. Small bilateral pleural effusions
with patchy
opacities in the lung bases, which are nonspecific, and may
reflect
aspiration, infection, or atelectasis.

[**2101-11-2**] CXR
Evaluation of the study is limited due to technique, also the
patient's chin obscures the apices of the lungs. Allowing this
limitation, the ET tube is against the right tracheal wall. NG
tube is in the s
