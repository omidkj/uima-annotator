Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 68 y.o. Female w/ history of tobacco use transferred
from [**Location (un) 620**] for evaluation of hemoptysis. Pt states that
afternoon 2 days PTA, she coughed up what she thought was phlegm
but turned out to be a dark blood clot with a tea spoon of
bright red blood. She was symptom free until afternoon PTA when
she had 4 episodes of hemoptysis, she states each episode showed
less than a teaspoon of blood. She decided to go to the ED in
[**Location (un) 620**]. In the [**Location (un) 620**] ED she underwent a CTA Chest which
showed unchanged pulmonary nodules, no pulmonarty embolism but
did show some infection versus bronchitis versus bronchiectasis.
Given that she was on Coumadin with an INR of 1.8 she was also
given 5 mg IV Vitamin K, 1 unit of FFP and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
She is being admitted to the ICU given risk of airway compromise
as well as bronchoscopy.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo F with h/o atrial fibrillation (subtherapeutic on
Coumadin), smoking history, family history of lung cancer
presents with 2 days of hemoptysis.

1. Hemoptysis: The patient was admitted to the medical intensive
care unit, where she was started on azithromycin. As there was
no evidence of massive hemoptysis, she was transferred to the
medical floor on hospital day 2. The differential diagnosis of
the patient's hemoptysis initially included
bronchitis/bronchiectasis, chronic infection, and pulmonary
hemorrhage syndrome. Given the patient's history of tobacco use
and her personal history of lung cancer, malignancy was also
considered. UA showed no blood or protein, making a pulmonary
renal syndrome less likely. The interventional pulmonology
service was consulted. Bronchoscopy was performed, and the
anterior segment of the lingula was felt to be the source of the
bleeding. No endobronchial lesion was identified. Brochoaveolar
lavage was performed, and the fluid was sent for cell counts,
microbiology, and cytology. The patient's outpatient providers
will need to follow up on the results of these studies. After
bronchoscopy, the interventional pulmonology team felt that
atypical infection and bronchiectasis in the setting of
anticoagulation was the most likely etiology of the patient's
hemoptysis. The IP team recommended repeat non-contrast CT in
[**1-31**] months, as well as the initiation of PPI therapy for
bronchoscopic evidence of laryngeal reflux. The patient will
complete a 5-day course of azithromycin.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation and was on anti-coagulation prior to admission.
Anticoagulation was reversed given hemoptysis and plan for
bronchoscopy.

3. Hypertension: The patient maintained good blood pressure
control on Altace and Metoprolol.

4. Hyperlipidemia: Patient continued Liptor.

5. Osteoporosis: Patient continued vitamin D, calcium, and
calcitonin.

Discharge Instructions:
You were evaluated for your episodes of hemoptysis and monitored
closely in the intensive care unit, treated for infectious
causes, and underwent bronchoscopy for further diagnostic work
up.
