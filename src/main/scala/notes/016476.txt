MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.3 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: *5.7 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 10% to 15% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Ascending: 2.6 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
Aorta - Descending Thoracic: *2.6 cm (nl <= 2.5 cm)
Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient: 36 mm Hg
Aortic Valve - Mean Gradient: 32 mm Hg
Aortic Valve - LVOT Diam: 1.9 cm
Aortic Valve - Valve Area: *0.5 cm2 (nl >= 3.0 cm2)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior
- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid
anteroseptal -
hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal
inferior -
hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid
inferolateral -
hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo;
anterior apex -
hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex -
hypo; apex -
hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic
valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the

anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient was
under general
anesthesia throughout the procedure.

Conclusions:
Pre-CPB: Severe global LV systolic dysfxn. No spontaneous echo
contrast is
seen in the left atrial appendage. Right ventricular chamber
size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild to
moderate ([**12-9**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.


Prior to weaning from bypass, a perivalvular leak was noted by
TEE, at the
non-coronary cusp. It was reduced by sutures on the outside of
the aorta,
without re-using x-clamp/opening aorta.

Post-cpb: Prosthetic aortic valve in place. Not able to discern
individual
leaflets. Severe left ventricular systolic dysfxn, and moderate
right
ventricular systolic dysfxn., being treated with high-dose
epi/milrinone/norepi infusions. Modest improvement, especially
in lateral and
anterior LV walls. MR now 1+. Aorta intact. Other parameters as
pre-bypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**6-1**] for evaluation of resolution of CHF and completion
of pre-op work-up.Underwent AVR/cabg x2 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] on
[**6-2**]. Of note, pre-bypass EF decreased to 10-15%. Transferred to
the CSRU in stable condition on epinephrine, milrinone,
levophed, insulin and propofol drips.Drips slowly weaned over
next 2 days and extubated the morning of POD #2. Chest tubes
also removed on POD #2.Low-dose ACE inhibitor started and beta
blockade titrated over next several days.Gentle diuresis started
and pacing wires removed on POD #3, then transferred to the
floor to begin increasing her activity level.Coumadin also
started for mechanical valve and heparin started for coverage
until therapeutic INR obtained. Cleared for discharge to home on
POD #9.  Target INR for an aortic mechanical valve is 2.0- 2.5.
