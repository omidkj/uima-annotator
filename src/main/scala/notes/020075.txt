Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 54 year old woman with history of ESRD on HD, HIV
([**11-29**] CD4 261, VL 5,640), [**Month/Year (2) 106113**] [**Month/Year (2) 106114**] pneumonitis
and severe pulmonary HTN who presents with HCT drop in the
setting of epistaxis. She has H/O cocaine use. she has had
guaiac positive stools but they are related to swallowing blood.
GI bleed concurrently is unlikely. No evidence of hemolysis at
the OSH or here. GI stated that guaiac positive stool is from
swallowed blood. ENT saw her and recommended packing to stay in
place for at least 5 days. However, her oozing persisted so they
recommended leaving the pack for additional days (3-4 days). We
asked her to check to our ER in 3 days after discharge for
possible removal of the packing if oozing stops. They
recommended Keflex to prevent toxic shock while packing in
place. She was advised to not use cocaine and come to the ER if
bleeding recurs. She was asked not to manipulate the packing.
She has been hemodynamically stable for many days.
