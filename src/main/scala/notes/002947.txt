Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachypnea/ectopy/altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6930**] is a 77 yo F with h/o COPD and h/o NSCLC, CAD,
longstanding hypertension, CHF with preserved EF, recurrent c
diff infections and diabetes who was brought into the hospital
for dyspnea, transferred to the floor initially and then
transferred soon after to the MICU for tachypnea, ectopy, and
altered mental status.
According to her family, she did not sound like her usual self
on the day of admission, and they stopped by to check on her as
they live in adjacent apartments. She was found to be short of
breath and tripoding. She was hypertensive on arrival of EMTs to
200 systolic.
In the ED, she was initiated on CPAP but was off around one half
hour later. She was thought to be in CHF exacerbation, and
received lasix 80mg IV x1 and SL NTG x2.
When she arrived to the floor, she was tachypneic and
tachycardic with frequent ectopy. She was sent to the unit for
further management shortly after arrival to medical floor.

The patient was previously a hairdresser, beautician and
saleslady. Until the age of 40, she smoked 2 packs per day and

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6930**] is a 77yo female with history of COPD, NSCLC, CAD,
longstanding hypertension, CHF and recurrent c. diff infections
presents with septic shock and profound lactic acidosis and
ultimately abdominal catastrophe.

1)Respiratory Failure: The patient was breathing in the 40's to
compensate for her acidemia and was beginning to tire out
overnight, neccesitating intubation. She is being maximized on
her minute ventilation to facilitate blowing off the acid, while
avoiding breath stacking given her severe underlying obstructive
disease. Once the lactate returned so high, this seemed to
explain that her hyperventilation was in compensation for
significant acidosis and not because of heart failure as
initially believed. ABGs were closely monitored and she remained
acidemic. Once the decision was made to withdraw care by her
family, the breathing tube was removed and the she expired soon
after.

2)Septic Shock: Unclear source. The assumption is an
intraabdominal catastrophe, possibly bowel ischemia given her
distended abdomen (which was not present on presentation to the
ED). While it is possible that the bowel abnormalities developed
secondary to hypotension, it still remains the only obvious
source of infection, given that she has a history of recurrent
c. diff infections. KUB was unrevealing. She was not stable
enough to undergo CT scan. She may have had a cardiac event with
a sudden decrease in CO, resulting in lactic acidosis and gut
ischemia. More likely she has stunned myocardium in the setting
of sepsis. Once the central line was placed, she was agressively
resuscitated with normal saline to maintain MAP>65 and CvO2>70.
Surgical consult was obtained and declined the patient as a
surgical candidate.
.
#. Rhythm: afib. patient has frequent short runs of NSVT which
improved on amiodarone. The ectopy was likely secondary to her
profound acidemia and electrolyte derangements.
.
#. Coronaries: shock could have been ischemic in etiology, ekg
was concerning for ectopy with NSVT, afib with RVR, but no
STTWC. Initial troponins were slightly elevated in the setting
of renal failure, tachycardia and sepsis. Held [**Known lastname 4532**] and
statin.
.
#. Leukocytosis:  See sepsis discussion above. Had history of
recurrent c diff infections. She was pancultured. CXR did not
reveal consolidation. We were considering GI source with
elevation in LDH, concern for ischemic bowel.
She was maintained on vanco po, vanco iv and levo, zosyn for
double gram negative coverage.
.
#. Acute renal failure: creatinine was elevated above baseline -
it has bumped in the past when dehydrated from infection. This
was likely secondary to prerenal azotemia with poor forward
flow.
.
#. Coagulopathy: Patient appeared to be in DIC, but never bleed
actively.
