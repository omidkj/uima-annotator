HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 -year-old female
who was recently discharged from the [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **]
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] following resolution of an upper
gastrointestinal bleed which was found to be secondary to
gastric ulcer.  She now returns to the hospital with
progressive shortness of breath and lower extremity edema.
One week prior to her first admission, she reports having had
a cough and shortness of breath, but denied any production of
sputum.

During her first hospitalization, she was hospitalized in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for an upper gastrointestinal
bleed with a hematocrit drop to 22.3 and she was found to
have a nonbleeding ulcer at the gastroesophageal junction.
After her stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, her
hospital course was notable for worsening dyspnea on exertion
and hypoxia with saturations equal to approximately 90% on
three liters of oxygen.  She was felt to have chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, versus fluid overload and was
started on Albuterol, Atrovent, and Flovent inhalers, as well
as Lasix 20 mg q day.  She had partial resolution of her
shortness of breath and was discharged with the diagnosis of
likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and
given metered dose inhalers and two liters of supplemental
oxygen at home.

On the day of discharge, she had an echocardiogram which was
to be forwarded to her primary care physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 4565**].
Following discharge, the patient developed further
progression of her dyspnea on exertion and worsening lower
extremity edema, for which she returned to the hospital on
[**2117-8-9**].  At that time she denied any paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, fever or chills, nausea or vomiting,
dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or black stools.  She
did at that time complain of some pleuritic chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

2.  Hypertension.
3.  Diabetes, type 2, for which the patient is taking oral
agents.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease with bilateral symptoms.
5.  Subtotal thyroidectomy.
6.  Question abdominal aortic aneurysm repair fifteen years

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is visiting [**State 350**] from

oropharynx clear.  Neck: supple, obese, no lymphadenopathy,
anterior scar visible.  Lungs: decreased breath sounds at the
bases, right side greater than left, bibasilar crackles,
otherwise decreased breath sounds, no wheezes.  Cardiac:
tachycardic, regular rhythm, distant heart sounds, S1, S2
normal, no S3 or S4, no murmurs, no jugular venous
distention.  Abdomen: obese, positive bowel sounds,
nontender.  Extremities: 2+ edema, 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  Neurologic: alert and oriented times three,
moving all four extremities.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count equal to
26.3, with 95% neutrophils, 2.3% lymphocytes, 1.6% monocytes,
hematocrit equal to 32.1 platelets equal to 477,000.  Sodium
equal to 133, potassium equal to 4.1, chloride equal to 95,
bicarbonate equal to 25, BUN equal to 17, creatinine equal to
1.7, glucose equal to 205.  CK equal to 99, troponin equal to
5.9.  PTT equal to 24.8, INR equal to 1.5.  Urinalysis:
negative.

Chest x-ray: mild congestive heart failure, bilateral pleural
effusions, increased in size from prior study.
Electrocardiogram: sinus tachycardia, Q-waves in III and AVF,
0.5 mm to 1.[**Street Address(2) **] depression in leads I and V4 through V6.
Chest CT scan: no evidence of pulmonary embolus, partial
collapse or consolidation of the right middle lobe, right
lower lobe, and left lower lobe, question pneumonia, large
right pleural effusion, moderate left pleural effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary:  When she returned to the hospital, the
patient was admitted directly to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit with hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and suspected
pneumonia.  She had a chest CT scan which revealed right
middle lobe and right lower lobe pneumonia as well as
bilateral pleural effusions.  The patient underwent
thoracentesis of the right lung which showed loculated
pleural effusions, exudative in nature, with a high white
blood cell count.  400 cc of yellowish fluid was drained at
that time.  She then underwent a left sided thoracentesis
which was complicated by a left pneumothorax.  This effusion
was also exudative by laboratory analysis.

She then underwent a VATS and decortication of the right
lung, as well as placement of chest tubes for drainage.  At
the time of discharge from the Medical Intensive Care Unit,
the patient's respiratory status had improved greatly and she
was discharged to the floor on three to four liters of
supplemental oxygen with oxygen saturation in the mid 90s.

On hospital day eleven, the patient's chest tubes were
removed and x-ray revealed no evidence of pneumothorax.
During her time on the floor and at discharge, the patient
remained on four liters of supplemental oxygen with oxygen
saturations in the mid 90s.  This was thought to be related
to a combination of resolving pneumonia as well as
atelectasis.  At the time of discharge, the patient was
instructed to continue her Flovent, Atrovent, and Albuterol
metered dose inhalers.

2.  Cardiovascular:  Echocardiogram revealed an ejection
fraction of 45% as well as septal and inferoseptal wall
motion abnormalities.  Elevated troponin at the time of
admission raised the possibility of a recent myocardial
infarction; however, it was thought that this was more likely
secondary to congestive heart failure and related myocardial
stretch.  The patient's shortness of breath and increased
lower extremity edema were thought to be partially related to
congestive heart failure, and the patient was therefore
diuresed accordingly.

At the time of discharge, the patient continued to have some
moderate lower extremity swelling; however, her lung
examination was unremarkable for significant signs of
congestive heart failure.  During her stay in the hospital,
the patient was seen by Cardiology who recommended that the
patient undergo further evaluation following discharge,
possibly including cardiac catheterization.  They did not
recommend pursuing this during her current hospitalization.
During her hospitalization, the patient's electrocardiograms
remained stable and she ruled out for a myocardial infarction
by CK enzymes, although troponin was elevated as mentioned
above.  The patient was discharged on Valsartan, Lipitor, and
Lopressor.

3.  Infectious Disease:  On admission, the patient was found
to be febrile with a white blood cell count equal to 26.3.
She was found to have a pneumonia as well as bilateral
loculated pleural effusions, which were exudative in nature.
She was subsequen
