Babesiosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
56 M orthopedic physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **] (good) until 7 Days PTA . 1
week prior to admission while in [**Country 18084**] he noticed sudden
onset of fatigue, no muscle pains, joint pains, denied cough,
fevers, sob, diarrhea, dysuria. On return, he had a cxr which
was negative per his report, and f/u blood work which
demonstrated intraerythrocytic parasites and he was admitted for
further treatment at an OSH.
.
While in [**Country 18084**] for 10 days, had been playing golf, no known
tick bites, however prior to trip, for the past month he had
noticed increasing fatigue, also multiple exposures to ticks,
which at [**Location (un) **], and in his gardens in [**Location (un) 1411**].
.
At OSH was noted to have WBC of 7800, 24% monos, ALT 102, AST
107, TBili 3.18 was started on clindamycin 1200mg q12h, quinine
650 PO. He was continued on clinda/quinine. Doxy was started for
possible ehrlichiosis co-infection. He was then transitioned to
atovaquone and azithromycin [**6-15**].

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**6-17**] for possible plasma exchange
given high parasitemia (10-15% at OSH). Parasitemia here was 6%
and, in discussion with transfusion medicine and infectious
disease services, it was decided that he did not need plasma
exchange. ICU course also notable for continued high-grade
fever, CHF (received IV lasix) and hearing loss (attributed to
quinine).

TTE: Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%) with inferior hypokinesis suggested (poor
image quality). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad

CTA CHEST: There is no pulmonary embolism. Thoracic aorta is
normal in caliber and contour, without evidence of dissection or
aneurysm. Heart, pericardium, and great vessels are normal.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is no enlarged
adenopathy within the chest. Central bronchi are patent to the
subsegmental level. There is evidence of previous median
sternotomy and cardiac surgery with CABG. Lung windows
demonstrate no pulmonary nodules or focal consolidations,
although evaluation of the left lower lobe and lingula is
slightly limited due to respiratory motion artifact. There are
small bilateral pleural effusions, and minor subsegmental
atelectasis at the lung bases bilaterally. Limited views of the
upper abdomen are notable for mild splenomegaly. Osseous
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY
Recently described interstitial edema has resolved. Cardiac
silhouette remains mildly enlarged with upper zone vascular
redistribution. New discoid atelectasis developed at the left
lung base peripherally.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted initially to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] then transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 516**]
Hospitalist Service

1. Babesiosis
- ID consultation
- [**Hospital **] clinic f/u on [**6-27**] with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
- Patient is being continued on docycycline given we have not
recieved his leptospirosis serology. This is a less likely
co-infection but must be considered given the constellation of
Sx
- Patient to continue atovaquone and zithromax until instructed
by ID to stop
- Serial thick smears demonstrated clearing of babesia
parasites, last smear 0.2%
- Presumed etiology of hemolysis
- The infection really behaved as if the patient is asplenic,
and he is being recommended to have this worked up at his PCPs
office
- Special babesia serologies were sent to the CDC for
speciation. These were pending at discharge

2. Transaminitis
- Likely due to babesia, however several features are hard to
explain, especially his albumin of 2.4
- Given the level of transaminases his lipitor was held
- Recommend further workup at his PCP's office in [**1-28**] weeks for
repeat serologies to restart lipitor
- His bilirubins have improved
