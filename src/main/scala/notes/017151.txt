History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 30380**] is an 87 year old man with COPD, CAD, CHF and Afib who
presented to BIDN complaining of dyspnea and hemoptysis. Patient
reports productive cough with yellow sputum for the past 3 weeks
that was treated with azithromycin by his primary care doctor
one week ago. Patient also c/o hemoptysis for the past 4-5 days,
which he described as "big globs" of blood. Patient also
endorses fever and chills at home.

  At BIDN, initial VS were 98.1 140 132/67 24 76% RA that
improved to 95% on NRB. Labs revelaed WBC 13.1 91.6%N and INR
8.0. CXR revealed RUL consolidation c/f PNA, and he received CTX
1g IV, Vitamin K and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

  At [**Hospital1 18**] initail VS were 99.0 120 111/70 24 94% 15L NRB. Labs
revealed lactate 2.9, WBC 13 92.5%N, HCT 40.7, Cr 2.2, proBNP
4254, TropT 0.28. ABG 7.43, 28, 81. Patient received 2 units
FFP, 40mg IV lasix, 10mg IV diltiazem, 30mg PO diltiazem, 500mg
IV azithromycin and 1g IV vancomycin. The patient was then
admitted to the MICU.

  On arrival to the MICU, the patient happeard was dyspnic with
oxygen saturation of 90% on NRB and was placed on non-invasive
ventillation with improvement to 100% oxygen saturation.

Imaging:
CXR [**4-24**]
Possible asymmetric right greater than left, pulmonary edema;
superimposed
infectious process not excluded. Given history of hemoptysis,
underlying
pulmonary hemorrhage is not excluded. Small right pleural
effusion.

CXR [**4-25**]
Status post median sternotomy for CABG with overall stable
cardiac and
mediastinal contours. Prosthetic aortic valve. There is interval
worsening
of bilateral airspace and interstitial process which may reflect
pulmonary
edema, worsening pneumonia, or a progressing hypersensitivity
reaction.
Pulmonary hemorrhage could also have this appearance. Clinical
correlation is advised. No pneumothorax. No acute pulmonary
abnormality appreciated.

TTE [**4-25**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is borderline low (LVEF 50%). A bioprosthetic aortic
valve prosthesis is well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
borderline low left ventricular systolic function. Well-seated
bioprosthetic aortic valve with normal transvalvular gradients.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2204-5-30**], the
left ventricular function appears less vigorous. The gradients
across the bioprosthetic aortic valve are normal.

CXR [**4-26**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there are
unchanged
bilateral airspace opacities and a small right pleural effusion.
The
opacities and the effusion have not changed in the interval.
Moderate
cardiomegaly, status post CABG with subsequent position of the
surgical
material. No other relevant findings.

CXR [**4-27**]
IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in diffuse pulmonary opacities,
suggesting
decrease in edema, with probable superimposed pneumonia.

CT Chest [**4-28**]
FINDINGS: There is mild, apical-predominant centrilobular and
paraseptal
emphysema. Diffuse ground-glass opacities are present throughout
both lungs, involving all lobes and extending to the pleural
surfaces. Early fibrosis with mild honeycombing at the lung
bases. Mild diffuse peribronchial wall thickening, but no
interstitial thickening. No pleural effusions.  Heart is normal
in size, without pericardial effusion. Changes of coronary
artery bypass grafting, with mediastinal clips. Note is made of
a prosthetic aortic valve and discarded right atrial/ventricular
pacemaker leads. Diffuse calcific atherosclerosis is present in
the thoracic aorta.  Prominent mediastinal nodes measure up to
12 mm in short axis in the superior right paratracheal region,
10 mm in the inferior right paratrache
