Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2103-8-15**] Cardiac cath
[**2103-8-16**] 1. Urgent coronary artery bypass grafting times 5 with
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
coronary; reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta the
first diagonal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein graft
from the aorta to the first obtuse marginal coronary; reverse
saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the distal right

History of Present Illness:
71 year old male reports a longstanding history of intermittent
chest pain occurring primarily related to stress and not related
to activity. He reports having this on a weekly basis for years
and states that over the last month, it has been occurring on a
daily basis, which he relates to increased stress in his life.
He denies any chest pain occurring with activity but does not
exercise on a regular basis. He reports having stress tests
every 2 years for many years and they have always been normal up
until this one. Due to the abnormalities on the stress test, the
patient has now been referred for cardiac catheterization. He is
now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization
after finding coronary artery disease upon cardiac
catheterization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2103-8-15**] Cardiac cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
some
minimal disease.  The LAD was notable for 90% stenosis of the
mid-LAD,
and 90% of the distal LAD.  The mid-LCx had a 90% stenosis.  The
RCA had
a 40% lesion proximally, and a 90% stenosis in the proximal PDA.

2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a moderately elevated
systolic
arterial pressure, with a central aortic pressure of 154/80,
mean 89
mmHg.

[**2103-8-16**] Carotid U/S: Minimal bilateral ICA plaque, no
appreciable associated stenosis, however (graded as less than
40% bilaterally).

[**2103-8-16**] Echo: Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the left atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 - 45 %). There is
hypokinesis of the basal infero- and anterior septum. There is
akinesis of the apex. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Post-CPB: The patient is in SR, on no inotropes. Preserved
biventricular systolic fxn, with EF now 45 - 50%. 1+ MR, no AI.
Aorta intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 71 yo male with hypertension and dyslipidemia
complaining of chronic chest pain and s/p abnormal stress test.
Cardiac catheterization showed multivessel disease. He was
brought to the operating room on [**2103-8-11**] where the patient
underwent  Urgent coronary artery bypass grafting times 5 with
left    internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
coronary; reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta the
first diagonal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein graft
from the aorta to the first obtuse marginal coronary; reverse
saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the distal right
coronary artery; as well as reverse saphenous vein single graft
from the aorta to the posterior descending coronary artery,and
endoscopic left and right greater saphenousvein harvesting.

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.   POD #1 found
the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD #4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions.
