Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint:  presyncope, palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 48F with h/o stage 4 jejunal adenocarcinoma with
peritoneal mets, HTN, DM2, HLD, followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], Yergulun,
on palliative chemotherapy with FOLFIRI/bevacizumab. She was
seen in clinic Monday [**5-10**] and was found to have superficial
phlebitis of the left lower leg, which responded to heating
pads. She now has worsening lower extremity pain now in the
medial thigh, which was so severe that she felt like she was
going to pass out. She endorsed palpitations. She presented to
[**Hospital 1562**] hospital, where an ultrasound showed new DVT, and she
was started on heparin 1400/hr. No CT chest was performed; Head
CT was negative, no rectal recorded.

OSH labs: trop 0.47 EKG: NSTTT. Vitals at OSH: 97.4 BP: 124/95
HR:104-124 97% 2l

In the ED, initial VS were:  Temp: 98.8 ??????F (37.1 ??????C), Pulse:
107, RR: 18, BP: 138/99, O2Sat: 96%, O2Flow: ra. CTA showed
Large bilateral PE, Saddle embolus at pulmonary artery; may also
be clot extending into right ventricle, right atrium but
difficult to tell due to motion. Right heart [**Hospital 16089**]. Rec'd 500cc
of IVF in ED.

Per cardiac surgery (Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] cardiac [**Doctor First Name **] attending on call),
thrombolysis was preferred to thrombectomy. Called Cards
(fellow, [**Doctor First Name 25812**] who discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], recommended
admission to MICU for TPA by intensivist. Given recent Dx of LLQ
dz, decision made not to proceed with TPA given risks of GIB.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is comfortable and not c/o any
pain. Denies CP, SOB, pleuritic CP, abdom pain, HA, leg pain.

ROS: negative for blurry vision, headache, SOB, cough, rash
Stable nausea, vomiting, diarrhea from chemotherapy.

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- Early [**2189**]: Began experiencing vague abdominal discomfort,
bloating, intermittent nausea/vomiting, and weight loss from
poor
PO intake.
- [**2189-3-21**]: Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for SBO after MR enterography
revealed dilatation of the proximal small bowel with a
transition
point in the mid-jejunum.  Just distal to the transition point,
there was evidence of intussusception with a 2 cm stretch of
circumferential bowel wall thickening concerning for a mass
lesion.
- [**2189-3-22**]:  Underwent exploratory laparotomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Intraoperatively, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] described a "[**1-4**] feet ...
obscured
jejunal strictured mass."  He thus performed a resection of that
segment of small bowel measuring 8.1 cm in length.  Pathology
revealed a 2.7 cm x 2.1 cm x 1.1 cm poorly-differentiated
invasive adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis propria
into the subserosa (pT3).  There were six lymph nodes available
for examination, four of which demonstrated metastatic
adenocarcinoma (pN2).  One of the lymph nodes demonstrated focal
extracapsular extension of the tumor. Of note, there was also
adenoma with high-grade glandular dysplasia adjacent to an
overlying epicenter of the invasive mass. Surgical margins were
negative with the closest margin being 3.5 cm at the proximal
margin.  There was evidence of lymphovascular invasion.  There
was no perineural invasion. KRAS G12V mutation confirmed; IHC
for
MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 were intact; Microsatellite stable
(MSS).
- [**2188-4-29**]: Began cycle 1 of modified FOLFOX6, however CEA noted
to be quickly rising so no further treatment was given at the
time. PET CT showed questionable increased uptake in portal
lymph
node.
- [**2189-6-9**]: Underwent repeat laparotomy to evaluate rising CEA for
possible wide excision of small bowel mesentery.
Intra-operatively, was found to have multiple small deposits
along the small bowel mesentery, pathology of which confirmed
metastatic adenocarcinoma.
- [**2189-7-21**]: Resumed mFOLFOX6 for palliation. Chose to take a
treatment break after her 12th (C7D1) dose on [**2189-12-7**].

CT Head ([**2190-5-16**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
Evaluation for metastasis is limited and would be better
performed with a contrast MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9304**].
.
CT Chest ([**2190-5-16**]):  IMPRESSION: Extensive pulmonary emboli

ECHO [**2190-5-17**]:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). No masses or thrombi are
