Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Electric Cardioversion.


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 35869**] is a 76 year old gentleman with a history of CAD s/p
stenting of RCA in [**2113**], hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and
new-onset atrial fibrillation, presenting with progressive
shortness of breath. His problems started a few months ago. He
started to feel more short of breath, especially with
exertion/walking, and he would experience left-sided sharp chest
pain (non pleuritic, no radiation or associated symptoms) with
severe episodes.  Of note, he was diagnosed with new atrial
fibrillation in [**11-14**], and was started on coumadin at this time
(and was on beta blocker already). He went to Floriday in
[**Month (only) 956**], and while on the plane, he had increased shortness of
breath with the associated chest pain. He also noted the onset
of new bilateral LE swelling.  When he got off the plane, he
went to a hospital in [**State 108**] where he was admitted for 2 days,
a CXR showed LLL infiltrate, and he was started on antibiotics
(completed a 7-day course of a fluoroquinolone).  A BNP was
normal at 50, he was given 40 mg IV lasix, and discharged on PO
Lasix. His symptoms did not improve and in fact, worsened. He
denied any fever/chills/abdominal pain/bowel or urinary
symptoms, but said he was experiencing PND/orthopnea (states he
hardly sleeps at night, can only sleep at 60-90 degree angle)
which had been getting progressively worse.  He denied
palpitations, light headedness, or dizziness, but he stated that
he had had episodes in the past few months where he would just
pass out/thought he suddenly fell asleep.  He denied any
prodromal symptoms before these episodes and denied any tongue
biting, loss of bowel or bladder function.  He does not think he
lost consciousness with these episodes.  He was hospitalized
this second time from [**Date range (1) 35870**], and at this time, he was treated
with rocephin/azithro, V/Q was low prob, bilateral LENI's were
negative, BNP was 126.  To work up these ?syncopal episodes,
neuro was consulted, and CT of the head was negative, bilateral
carotid US showed only 30% stenosis, EEG was negative, and TTE
showed EF=60% with trival PR, borderline concentric LVH.  He was
discharged and returned to [**State **] on the day of
admission.  He came right to the hospital, stating that he had
no improvement in his symptoms of shortness of breath.

In the ED, he was afebrile, 92% on room air, found to have BNP
of 1386.  He was given 40 mg IV lasix with good diuresis.  CTA
could not be performed, for he couldn't lie flat due to his SOB.
 He was admitted for further workup of this shortness of breath.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO/TTE ([**2117-3-4**]): The left atrium is normal in size. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Views are technically
suboptimal for assessment of ventricular systolic function. Left
ventricular function is probably mildly impaired with
inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis. Estimated ejection fraction
?50%. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is probably normal. The aortic
root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior
pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. There is at least mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

ECHO/TTE ([**2117-3-16**]): The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be estimated. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2117-3-4**], the findings are similar (trace aortic
regurgitation is now seen - may be due to technical
differences).

CXR PA/LAT ([**2117-3-2**]): The heart is of normal size for technique.
The pulmonary vascularity is difficult to evaluate due to very
low lung volumes. There are bibasilar atelectases. There is a
left retrocardiac opacity that most likely represents
atelectasis. There are no obvious pleural effusions. There are
degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. The patient is
status post posterior spinal fusion of the lumbar spine. There
is no pneumothorax.

CXR PA/LAT ([**2117-3-16**]): IMPRESSION: Persistent patchy bibasilar
opacities, most likely due to atelectasis. Underlying infection
in the left lower lobe cannot be fully excluded.
