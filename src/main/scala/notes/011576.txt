Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall and SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
89yo CM with PMHx significant for CAD s/p incomplete atherectomy
and PCA ([**1-27**]), and recent echo ([**7-27**]) demonstrating CHF (EF:
25-30%), moderate AS (valve area 1.0), mild->mod AR, mod MR, mod
TR, and mild pulm artery systolic HTN as [**Doctor Last Name **] as DM2, and CKI
(baseline Cr ?2-2.7) who was admitted to the ICU for managment
of altered mental status in the setting of hypervolemic
hyponatremia.
.
Prior to his admission the patient had been gaining weight (from
172 lbs to 180 lbs) and had B/L effusions on CXR, which prompted
his PCP to increased his Toresimide on [**7-12**] from 10 mg to 20 mg
in the AM and 5 mg to 10 mg in the PM. Over the next week his
weight remained stable at 184. And per a prior note his wife
reports that the patient had experienced a decrease in urine
output, but no CP, SOB, PND, orthopnea, or abdominal pain.
.
On day of admission the patient was leaning over to put on his
slippers and fell over. His wife found him alert and attempting
to get up, then called the EMS. In the ED he was awake and
responsive and his initial vitals were 97.4, 82, 137/89, 16, 91%
on 3L NC, but throughout the next couple of hours he became
unresponsive and was found to be hyponatremic to 118. Head CT
was negative. He was guaic-negative.
.
In the MICU it was determined that the patient's hyponatremia
was hypervolemic hyponatremia consistent with his history of
heart failure and chronic kidney injury. He was placed on a
lasix drip and diuresed about 6L, taking into consideration the
need to not decrease his preload in the setting of AS in order
to maintain his CO. Renal was consulted for his elevated Cr,
which occurred likely secondary to poor forward flow state and
suggested an SPEP/UPEP, which was negative for Bence [**Doctor Last Name **]
protein. His lasix drip was d/c and he continued to
auto-diurese. His Toresmide was restarted and a Heart Failure
consult was requested.

==========================================
IMAGING Studies:
.
Head CT ([**7-28**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
CXR ([**7-28**]):
IMPRESSION: Increased size of right pleural effusion, now
moderate, with persistent small left pleural effusion.
Subsegmental atelectasis in the right lung base, as well as mild
atelectasis in the left lung base.
.
ECHO ([**7-29**]):
Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
The estimated cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.0 cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-19**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-4-10**],
biventricular systolic function is more depressed suggesting a
diffuse process. The severity of aortic regurgitation and mitral
regurgitation are increased. The aortic valve gradient is lower,
but is likely due to reduced stroke volume.
.
Cardiac Cath ([**8-6**]):
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
was
limited to the left-sided circulation. The LMCA had mild
disease. The
LAD was heavily calcified and had serial diffuse 90% stenoses in
the
proximal, mid, and distal portions of the vessel. Angiography of
the
left circumflex demonstrated a 40% proximal stenosis and a 70%
stenosis
at the ostium of the OM1. There was collateral flow from the LAD
to the
distal circumflex system.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right heart
filling
pressures with a mean PCW of 35 mmHg and RVEDP of 11 mmHg. There
was
moderate to severe pulmonary arterial systolic and diastolic
hypertension with a PASP of 67 mmHg and PADP of 30 mmHg. There
was
moderate systemic arterial hypertension with SBP 152 mmHg. The
cardiac
index was preserved (3.5 l/min/m2).
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of distal LAD with 2.5x18 mini
Vision
bare metal stent.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of mid LAD with 2.5x18mm mini
Vision
bare metal stent post dilated to 3.0mm.
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of proximal LAD with 3.0x18mm
Vision
bare metal stent post dilated to 3.0mm.
6. Successful closure of right femoral arteriotomy with 6F
angioseal.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left heart filling pressures
3. Moderate Systemic arterial systolic hypertension
4. Moderate to severe pulmonary arterial systolic and diastolic
hypertension
5. Normal cardiac index
6. Successful PCI of distal LAD with BMS.
7. Successful PCI of mid LAD with BMS.
8. Successful PCI of proximal LAD with BMS.
9. Successful closure of right femoral arteriotomy with 6F
angioseal.
