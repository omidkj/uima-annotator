movement was three days prior to admission.  She has
decreased urine output the prior two days, no chest pain
although she does have some shortness of breath and abdominal
pain over the past few days.  She feels weak and has diffuse
aches and pains.  She has a history of GI bleed in the
setting of anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism.  In
[**2174-2-18**] she underwent embolization of a duodenal artery
by interventional radiology at that time.  She has a large
pancreatic mass requiring gastrojejunostomy done by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] because of stricture/obstruction.  She has not
noticed any melena or bright red blood per rectum.  In the
Emergency Room she was with blood pressure 80/60, hematocrit
12.5, received one liter of normal saline, one unit of packed
red blood cells.  EGD showed bleeding of a pancreatic mass in
the stomach.  Patient and family wanted to proceed with IR
intervention.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission is notable for
temperature 97.7, pulse 79, blood pressure 94/63,
respirations 15.  100% sat on room air.  In general, alert
and oriented times three, no acute distress, Russian

light, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear, right
IJ line in place, no lymphadenopathy.  Heart tachycardic, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Chest is clear to auscultation
bilaterally, no wheezes or rales.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
active bowel sounds, positive ascites.  Extremities, no

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count 13.2, hematocrit 12.5,
platelet count 219,000, INR 1.3, BUN 56, creatinine 1.0.
LFTs within normal limits.  CK and troponin within normal
limits.  Albumin 2.9.  EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 86 with
normal axis, normal intervals, a Q in lead 3 which is old
with flipped T in 1 and 2 and 3 which is new.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and taken to the
Intensive Care Unit.  For left GI bleed she received multiple
units of packed red blood cells and then a stable hematocrit
after transfusions in the mid 30's.  EGD was done which
showed a bleeding pancreatic mass and therefore patient went
to angiography, had embolization of her gastroduodenal branch
with good results.  She has been hemodynamically stable since
the procedure and was called out of the Intensive Care Unit
on [**2174-6-9**].  The procedure was complicated with right groin
hematoma which has since improved.  A radiation oncology
consult was obtained to evaluate for palliative radiation to
the site of her mass.  They felt it would not be of benefit.
After discussion with the family and with the patient, we
decided on no further treatment at this time for the
malignancy but to try to optimize her status by transferring
her to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Rehab.  Her PO intake has been
gradually increased with the normal 50 cc IV fluids.  Also of
note, her CKs were normal and her blood pressure was
initially low and then as it increased the Metoprolol and
then the Captopril were able to be added back on.  She had
occasional runs of supraventricular tachycardia which all
stopped spontaneously.  Her hematocrit after 6 units of
packed red blood cells is in the mid 30's.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Calcium carbonate one po tid,

Ambien 5 mg po q h.s. prn, Glucotrol 5 mg po bid, Colace 100
mg po bid.  Diet is cardiac and diabetic.  She will have

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Metastatic pancreatic cancer/biliary cancer.
2.  Pulmonary embolism.
3.  Upper GI bleed, now status post embolization.

Patient is stable for transfer. Upon transfer her oncologist
will have further discussions with the family about code
status and possible hospice placement.
