Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
SVC Syndrome

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**7-18**] tracheal bronchial stent placement
[**7-19**] Svc stent placement: 6mm and 8mm Stent placed


History of Present Illness:
57 year old male from [**State 1727**] with CAD s/p MI x2 ([**2135**], [**2143**]),
?COPD (on 2L home O2, 3ppd smoking for years), atrial flutter on
coumadin, found to have new lung mass with recent onset of SVC
syndrome, s/p bx at VA [**Location (un) 669**], now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
airway protection prior to initiation of XRT.
.
Patient initially went to [**Hospital6 43614**] Center in
[**2152-11-10**] for CP. W/u revealed a new mediastinal mass and he
was transferred to Togus VA for further workup. An initial
bronchoscopy was performed but biopsies have been nondiagnostic.
A f/u CT on [**2153-6-3**] revealed spread of the mass to the
right lung. He also developed pneumonia during this time and
went into new-onset atrial flutter during another bronchoscopy
which had to be aborted because of this event. He was started on
diltiazem and coumadin. However, his rate was difficult to
control. He underwent repeat bronchoscopy in [**Month (only) 205**] but obtained
tissue only revealed necrosis per the patient.
.
The patient was eventually transferred to the VA [**Location (un) 669**] for
CT-guided biopsy given these unsuccessful attempts to make a
diagnosis. He was initially on the floor after admission on
[**2153-7-3**] but transferred to the CCU b/o 6-8 seconds pauses after
diltiazem, digoxin and atenolol given for treatment resistent
atrial flutter with RVR in the 150s. His coumadin was held for
the biopsy and he was kept on a heparin drip. His rate remained
difficult to be controlled despite several treatment attempts.
He became symptomatic after relative bradycardia to the 60s
(nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness and diarrhea). His symptoms
abated after CBB reversal and dopamine drip.
.
His course was c/b wheezing and SOB as well as increasing SVC
syndrome with swelling of his face, both arms and ears. He
initially received a 5-day course of PO prednisone for wheezing
but was switched to IV decadrone to reduce swelling from his SVC
compression. He was also started on azithromycin for
post-obstructive PNA.
.
The CT-guided biopsy showed sarcoma versus melanoma. Plans were
made to provide XRT at [**Location (un) 538**] VA. However, he was
transferred eventually to [**Hospital1 18**] because of the concern for
airway compromise during XRT. He was transferred on Verapamil
and Digoxin for rate control as well as a heparin drip.
.
On ROS, the patient denies any fevers but nightsweats since
[**2115**], weightloss (10 lbs in one month) with decreased appetite,
and cough with clear sputum and occasional brownish clots coming
up. He denies frank hemoptysis, N/V or SOB in rest. However, he
did become more SOB over the last few months, most recently he
can only walk to the bathroom w/o dyspnea. He is on 2L home O2.
He denies any CP, constipation, urinary symptoms or blood in the
stool (although he does have bleeding hemorrhoids with
occasional blood on top of the stool).

[**Hospital1 18**] STUDIES:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-7-16**] 7:23 PM: Opacification of the
right upper lung likely represents lung collapse due to proximal
obstruction. It is associated with moderate sized right pleural
effusion and compression of the lower trachea. Multiple masses
in the left lung field measure up to 3.7 cm. Cardiac size is
normal with prominence of the left atrial appendage.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-7-21**] 7:20 PM: There has been no
appreciable radiographic change. Right upper lobe is collapsed
around a mass and multiple nodules are seen in the remaining
portion of the right lung and left. There is probably a small
left pleural effusion. The stent is not radiographically
apparent. There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-7-27**] 10:33 AM
No change, given slight differences in technique, to the
opacified right hemithorax reflective of effusion and right
upper lobe collapse.

[**Numeric Identifier 73512**] EXTREM BILAT VENOGRAPHY  [**2153-7-19**] 8:54 AM
Reason: stent placement in SVC
Contrast: OPTIRAY
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent was obtained from the
patient explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure. The
patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the
right arm was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
Using ultrasonographic guidance and a micropuncture sheath
system, access was gained into the right basilic vein and a
0.018 guidewire and 5 Fr sheath was placed. The inner dilator
was then removed as well as the wire and a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire
was placed up to the level of the subclavian vein under
fluoroscopic guidance. The vascular sheath was exchanged for a
5- French [**Last Name (un) 2493**] Tip sheath and a right subclavian venogram was
then performed. The venogram demonstrated no antegrade
opacification/flow through the SVC, with retrograde flow in the
right IJ and collaterals. Using a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire, the 5-
French [**Last Name (un) 2493**] Tip sheath was exchanged for a 7- French [**Last Name (un) 2493**] Tip
sheath. Using a combination of a 5- French Kumpe catheter and a
0.035 Glidewire, access was gained into the SVC and then
distally into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic
guidance. The Kumpe catheter was advanced all the way into the
inferior vena cava and the Glidewire was exchanged for a 0.035
[**Doctor Last Name **] wire that was placed with tip in the inferior vena cava
preserving access. The 5- French Kumpe catheter was removed and
then reinserted through the 7 Fr sheath alongside the [**Doctor Last Name **]
wire. The Kumpe and Glidewire were then used to selectively
catheterize the left brachiocephalic vein, and a left
brachiocephalic venogram performed. This showed mixed retrograde
and antegrade flow, with mild narrowing of the left
brachiocephalic vein at its confluence with the right.The Kumpe
catheter and a Bentson guidewire were then negotiated through
the severely narrowed SVC into the right atrium. Pull-back
SVC-grams were performed delineating the anatomy and extent of
the seve
