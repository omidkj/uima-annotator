Unresponsiveness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EEG Monitoring

History of Present Illness:
63 y.o. female with history of seizures and CVA as well as
multiple abdominal surgeries and recent mesenteric ischemia s/p
bowel resection who was admitted to the general medicine floor
lastnight for confusion, hallucinations, increased falls and
worsened abdominal pain. In the ED, she was evaluated by
neurology where an LP was done and was normal and a CT head
showed posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy vs. multiple old
CVAs. She was additionally seen by surgery to evaluate abdomen
and drains were felt to be in place and working well.
.
This morning, patient was found unresponsive by nurse with right
arm twitching, concerning for a seizure. Of note, patient has
history of a seizure disorder since [**2108**] and was on Dilantin
until one month ago when it was stopped because of problems with
line clogging. She was then switched to [**Year (4 digits) 13401**] 500 mg [**Hospital1 **]. She
was also recently taken off of Klonopin. Patient was only
responsive to sternal rub this morning and a trigger was called
for change in mental status. She was given a total of 6 mg of
Ativan with improvement of twitching. She was additionally
loaded with Dilantin after which her blood pressure dropped to
SBP of 80s. She received a 500 cc bolus with improvement of her
BP. The stroke fellow was notified and requested a stat CTA head
perfusion study. Patient was transferred to the ICU for further
management.


Past Medical History:

s/p tonsillectomy
Seizure d/o - since [**2108**]
CVA '[**08**]

Social History:
Married female living with husband. Unknown occupation status.
Smokes cigarettes: unknown amount, denies alcohol/illicit drug

Family History:
n/c

Physical Exam:
General: Cachectic, mute and largely unresponsive, though she
does withdraw from sternal rub
HEENT NC/AT; PERRLA,
CV: S1,S2 nl, no m/r/g appreciated
Lungs: CTAB anteriorly
Abd: Soft with old surgical scars and G and J tubes,
well-appearing
Ext: No c/c/e
Neuro: Limited due to patient's inability to cooperate, but
notable for 2+ bilateral biceps reflexes, but otherwise reflexes
could not be elicited; upgoing toes bilaterally;
Skin: No lesions


Pertinent Results:
CT Head ([**11-18**]): Confluent subcortical white matter hypodensity
in the frontal and parieto-occipital lobes bilaterally, most
likely representing chronic subcortical infarcts.  Given the
distribution, another differential consideration would include
PRES, which does not appear concordant with the clinical
presentation.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 y.o. female with multiple medical problems, admitted for
confusion and ?gait instability treating in MICU for ? seizure
vs status.
.
Seizure: Patient has a history of seizures and had been on
Dilantin, which was switched to [**Doctor First Name 13401**] because of problems with
a clogged PICC, though [**Name (NI) 13401**] was subtherapeutic.  Transferred
to MICU for episode of status vs seizure.  She was dilantin
loaded and continued on [**Name (NI) **].  Dilantin levels monitored
closely and doses titrated for goal corrected level 20-25.
Continuous EEG performed without evidence of seizures.
.
Delirium: Likely multifactorial. ID w/u revealing for GNR in
blood (details below) potentially contributing.  LP negative.
No evidence of seizures on EEG.  Likely significant contribution
of PRESS syndrome(posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy)
causing visual hallucinations from the occipital lobes which was
managed as below.  Intermittently responded to Zydis.  Her pain
was treated with dilaudid and then morphine elixir after
palliative care consult with question of contribution.  She was
eventually started on standing ativan with improved agitation.
.
Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome: Seen on MRI.
This could account for hallucinations, altered ms, and seizures.
 Pls see neurology notes for details.  Thought [**1-30**] hypertension,
which occurs in setting of pain.  We maintained goal SBP 140
given proven improvement in sx with good BP control.  Were not
more aggressive given hx of bowel ischemia.
.
ID: Grew 2/2 bottles GNR from Hickman cath on presentation to
MICU.  Other blood cx negative.  Repeat CT abd performed which
showed no evidence of bowel or intraabdominal abscess.  Surgery
was consulted and did not recommend surgery or change of line.
Recommended treating through it and she received a 14 day course
of ceftriaxone.
.
Hx of bowel ischemia s/p resection: as above.  Surgery followed
pt.  Repeat imaging showed no abscess for drainage.  Pain
control as below
.
Chronic Pain: In the setting of multiple abdominal surgeries.
Pain medications intially minimized to assess mental status.
These were added back and she was relatively well controlled
with dilaudid IV prn.  Fentanyl patch was added back.  At the
recommendation of palliative care, dilaudid was changed to
morphine elixir for ease of transition to home.
.
Psych: On multiple medications for depression/anxiety.
- Continued Venlafaxine. Held Restoril given somnolence
.
FEN: She was profoundly malnurished.  TPN for nutrition.
.
Access: Right Hickman, left PIV
.
Code: DNR/DNI
.
Dispo: After long discussion with the patient and her family,
patient expressed wishes to go home with hospice. With the help
of the palliative care team, she was transitioned to morphine
and fentanyl for pain, ativan for agitation, and per neuro PR
[**Month/Day (2) **] for seizures. She will not be going home with any IV
medications and the Hickman will not be used any longer. Goals
of care is patient's comfort. She will be receiving home hospice
while at home.
