Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
fall, unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66921**] is a 75 year old man with history of grade 4 left
parieto-occipital GBM, found minimally responsive after a fall
at
home in the bathroom at 8 p.m. tonight.  He is currently
ungergoing chemotherapy with Temazolamide (yesterday he went for
his 21 day lab check, following up his most recent 5 day
course).
His oncologist is Dr.[**Name (NI) 24469**] at [**Hospital1 2025**], and this is where he has
received all his prior medical care.  According to Mr.
[**Known lastname 66922**] girlfriend, his functional status has declined
steadily over the past couple of weeks.  He has not been taking
steroids as far as she knows and there have been no recent
changes to his medications.  However, he has become less
interactive, perseverating about his brain all the time, and is
having increasing difficulty getting about with his walker.  He
has been in two car accidents in the past two months (both his
fault, rear-ending people), after one of which he was reportedly
found to have increased cerebral edema and was hospitalized at
[**Hospital1 2025**] (per an ED discharge summary from [**Hospital3 10310**] that was
included with his paperwork).  We don't have any information
about the details of this hospitalization, or any recent
imaging,
though.  Mr. [**Known lastname 66922**] girlfriend is not aware of any history
of seizures. He is taking Keppra 500 [**Hospital1 **] prophylactically.
      Yesterday Mr. [**Known lastname 66921**] had to appear in court regarding
his most recent car accident, and he was quite "out of it."
Then
this evening at 8 p.m. his girlfriend was downstairs and he was
upstairs, and she heard a thud.  She came upstairs to find him
lying on the floor of the bathroom, on his back, looking at her
but not responding.  She called 911 and he was brought by EMS to
[**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital, where his blood pressure was 212/111
with hr 102, and where his exam was documented as revealing
equal
pupils, "unresponsive," and right sided weakness (unclear how
much the weakness represented a change from his baseline
neurologic exam).  He was intubated for airway protection, for
which he received etomidate, succinycholine, ativan, and versed.

He had a head CT there which revealed significant vasogenic
edema
of the left hemisphere and small areas of hemorrhage at the left
frontal pole and the right occipital region (?within ventricle
or
mass).  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
      Upon arrival at the ED here he was still hypertensive to
190/90's, with hr 106.  His temperature was 100 rectal.  He had
a
repeat head CT which revealed the areas of hemorrhage to be
unchanged, but increased rightward shift compared to the scan
from earlier this evening.  He was given Decadron 10 mg IV, and
started on a Mannitol infusion per Neurosurgery recommendations.

Neurosurgery evaluated the patient and felt there was no acute
surgical intervention to be done at this time.
The patient was then admitted to the Neurology ICU service for
further monitoring and treatment.

hypertension
gout - takes colchicine


Social History:

[**6-5**] CT BRAIN:
IMPRESSION:  Acute foci of hyperintensity in the left frontal
and
parietal cortex consistent with contusion.  Compared to prior
study from outside hospital, these do not appear significantly
larger.  Diffuse hypodensity
within the left brain consistent with edema and history of GBM
with mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and rightward
shift of normally midline structures.  Compared to the study
from
the outside hospital, there appears to
have been interval increase in the amount of rightward shift.
Medial shift of left temporal lobe concerning for impending
uncal
herniation.

anterior wedging of C7 cervical body, of uncertain acuity

CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS

FINDINGS:  Compared to the exam obtained one day earlier, there
are stable
