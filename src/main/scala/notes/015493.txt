CC:[**CC Contact Info 25938**]
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
48 F with PMH MS (wheelchair bound) presented to [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital
[**2168-3-13**] with complaints of fever on last Fri. Prior to
presentation, pt had fevers and UTI and was treated with 10 d of
levo (completed [**3-11**]). Initial CXR from [**Last Name (un) 4068**] demonstrated
enlarged L pleural effusion. While at [**Location (un) 620**], had CT chest
which demonstrated large pericardial effusion / L pleural
effusion. Was started on Ceftriaxone/Azithro to cover for Strep
pneumo. Also spiked T101 at OSH on [**3-14**]. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
diagnostic/therapeutic pericardiocentesis.
.
220 ml serosanguinous fluid was removed from pericardial sac,
pigtail was placed for continuous drainage. Effusion was thought
to be loculated.
.
Pt has hx of basal cell ca on her nose, that was removed several
years ago. She been having intermittent fevers for months. 20 lb
unintentional weight loss in the last month. Pt has been having
mammograms since age 40, last in [**Month (only) **], all wnl. No past or
present smoking hx. Has not had colonoscopy since age 48, but no
colon ca in family. CT chest showed no mediastinal or hilar LAD.
Family hx of cancer on both sides.

Pertinent Results:
Pericardiocentesis [**2169-3-15**]:
1. Baseline resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated
right sided pressures (RA mean 10 mmHg), normal pulmonary, and
normal
left sided pressures with a normal cardiac index (3.3 l/min/m2).
The
initial pericardial pressure equaled the RA pressure (10 mmHg).
2. Pericardiocentesis was performed and approximately 220 ml of
sero-sanguinous fluid was removed until pericardial pressure was
less
than 0. It was not possible to remove more fluid despite
posterior
positioning of the catheter. RA pressure following the
intervention was 5 mmHg. A pericardial catheter was left to
drain and the patient left the laboratory in stable condition.
.
TTE [**2169-3-15**] 7 pm:
There continues to be a moderate to large pericardial effusion.
No significant change compared to prior. No evidence of RV
collapse in diastole to suggest tamponade.
.
EKG: NSR at 119, Q in III, TWI I, low voltage
.
TTE [**2169-3-15**]:
EF 70-75%, 1+MR, 1+TR, large pericardial effusion, question of
loculation, echodense, no tamponade, no RV collapse
.
CT chest [**2169-3-14**]:
No mediastinal or hilar LAD, L left pleural effusion, collapsed
LLL, small R effusion, no pneumonia. VERY LARGE PERICARDIAL
EFFUSION, LARGE LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION, AND SMALL RIGHT PLEURAL
EFFUSION.  COMPRESSIVE LEFT LOWER LOBE COLLAPSE SECONDARY TO THE
EFFUSION.  NO PNEUMONIA SEEN IN THE VISUALIZED AERATED PORTIONS
OF THE LUNGS.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 F with PMH MS (wheelchair bound) presenting with intermittent
fevers, pericardial effusion and pleural effusion.
.
# Pericardial effusion and Cardiac:
Differential Dx:  Possibilities for etiology of pericardial and
pleural effusion include drug-induced hypersensitivity
(increased serum eosinophil count), drug effect (patient was
taking copaxone for years and zenapax for 4 months, both of
which deviates T cells to a Th2 response, which promotes an
eosinophilic response), infection (GPC in broth from pericardial
biopsy), and autoimmune disease (unusual presentation of lupus
or vasculitis to have isolated effusions).
.
On admission, a TTE showed a large possibly loculated
pericardial effusion (greater posteriorly - 3.5 cm compared with
anteriorly - 1.2 cm) that was echodense and consistent with
blood, inflammation and cellular elements without evidence of
tamponade.  The patient was taken to the cath lab for
pericardiocentesis with removal of 220 ml of serosanguinous
fluid and placement of a pigtail catheter.  Another 200 cc
drained on the floor before the catheter stopped draining and
was pulled on [**3-17**].  Analysis of the fluid was consistent with
an exudate (see pertinent results).  Cytology showed 79%
lymphocytes, some activated forms consistent with a reactive
process.  Microbiology studies showed no bacterial or fungal
growth.  Acid fast culture continues to show NGTD, but the AFB
smear was negative.  Following pericardiocentesis and drainage,
she continued to have a large circumferential pericardial
effusion by TTE without signs of tamponade.  Repeat pulsus
checks were consistently 6.  CT surgery performed VATS to
evacuate the pericardial effusion without complication. TTE
showed EF 70%, 1+ MR, 1+ TR.
.
All autoimmune and vasculitic markers checked returned negative.
Pericardial biopsy showed Gram positive cocci only growing in
broth, which may be contamination. Biopsy showed lymphocytes,
degranulating eosinophils, and a few scattered PMNs.  Tissue
culture needs to be followed after discharge, although the
effusion is unlikely to be caused by a bacterial infection
because the patient has clinically been asymptomatic other than
fevers.
.
# Pleural effusion:
Pt has had fevers and 20 lb weight loss over the last several
weeks.  To evaluate for a source of possible malignancy and L
pleural effusion seen on CXR, she was sent for a CT with IV and
oral contrast following the pericardiocentesis which showed a
large left pleural exudative effusion, small right pleural
effusion, indeterminant 1.4-cm adrenal nodule, dilated common
duct measuring 7-8 mm with no obvious obstructing source.  The L
pleural effusion was tapped 1L by interventional pulmonology,
revealing straw-colored, clear fluid.  There was no pus noted in
the pericardial or pleural fluid.  Patient was asymptomatic
before and after procedure, with >95% O2 sat.
.
# Fevers:
Etiology unknown.  Fevers up to 103 were intermittent, and
patient would spike once a day and then remain afebrile for the
remainder of the day.  Patient's fever improved after surgical
evacuation of pericardial effusion, with maximum temp 99.5
during last day.
.
# Multiple sclerosis:
Patient was advised to follow up with her neurologist and stop
taking Copaxone (glatiramer) HS and Zenapax for life. Patient
will continue to take Baclofen 60 [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Osteoporosis:
Fosamax and Ca carb were held during admission, but may be
continued after discharge.
.
# Anxiety:
Paxil and Zyprexa prn were continued during admission.
