ECHO-The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of mild
to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad.

EKG [**2141-12-19**]-
Atrial fibrillation
Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities
These findings are nonspecific but clinical correlation is
suggested
Since previous tracing of the same date, no significant change
.
CXR-FINDINGS: No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is
mildly enlarged in
this patient with a dual-channel pacemaker device in place.
Pulmonary vessels
are essentially within normal limits and there is no definite
pleural effusion
or acute pneumonia.

Cardiac Cath [**2141-12-22**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Unsccessful attempt to cross the LCX CTO.
4. Successful rotablation, PTC and stenting of the RCA.
.
CT SCAN TORSO [**2141-12-23**] -
IMPRESSION:
1. Left inner thigh hematoma. No evidence of retroperitoneal
bleed.
2. Significant coronary artery calcification.
3. Age-indeterminate compression fracture of L4; in the right
clinical
context further imaging such as edema-sensitive MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9304**].

4. Left adrenal adenoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms [**Known lastname 10148**] is an 87 yo F w afib, TIA, temporal
arteritis, hypothyroidism, HTN who presented to OSH with chest
pain, was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath for NSTEMI, and is now
s/p CCU stay.
.
#. NSTEMI:  The patient was found to have a NSTEMI given the
patient's symptoms and elevation in cardiac enzymes.  She did
not have any changes in her EKG.  She was treated with a heparin
drip, integrillin and plavix while we waited for her INR to
drift down to an acceptable level.  She underwent cardiac
catheterization and was found to have 2 vessel coronary artery
disease.  The interventional cardiologists were unable to treat
the LCX lesion, but stents were placed in the right coronary
artery.  The patient's hospitalization was complicated by a
bleeding and hypotension after her catheterization.  She was
given 2 units of PRBCs and a CT scan of the torso revealed left
inner thigh hematoma.  A femoral line was place for access and
she was transferred to the CCU for more intensive monitoring.
She received fluids to maintain her blood pressure.  She was
started on prednisone because of concern of adrenal
insufficiency since the patient had recently been taken off
steroids.  She is being discharged on a steroid taper.  After 2
days in the CCU, she was hemodynamically stable and Hct was
stable ~30.  The [**Hospital 2
