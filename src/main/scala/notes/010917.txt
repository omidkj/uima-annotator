Hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular

TEE (Transesophageal Echocardiogram) with DC cardioversion
[**2149-7-18**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7594**] is a 79 y/o female with rheumatic heart disease s/p
porcine MVR (bioprosthetic mitral valve, on coumadin), moderate
aortic insufficiency, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response which has been poorly controlled during recent
hospitalization (was recently chemically cardioverted into NSR),
and recent treatment for enterococcal bacteremia and
endocarditis for 4 weeks at the end of [**Month (only) 116**] to the early part of
this month, who initially presented to [**Hospital3 7569**] for ?
dehydration vs. orthostatic hypotension. She reports that she
"almost passed out" and was "dizzy" at times. She reports "loss
of balance" and "inability to get up." During admission, she was
treated with IVF and fludrocortisone for the hypotension. She
had CT abdomen and pelvis for mild abdominal pain. She was felt
to have ? diverticulitis for which she was started on flagyl. On
her labs, she was noted to be in acute renal failure. The [**Last Name (un) **]
was felt to be in part due to gentamycin, and this was
discontinued. They continued the IV vancomycin. She was
discharged home.

 She presented on [**7-13**] for a generalized rash over her body,
swollen lips, and some lesions in her mouth felt to be due to
the recently started flagyl. The rash was felt to be c/w
erythema multiform per dermatology. There was no airway
compromise, but she did report some difficulty swallowing. She
was kept on IV steroids, which was changed to oral prednisone on
date of transfer. Rash and erythema improved per dermatology
team. Reportedly, her SBP was in the 80s, and she was
resuscitated with IVF. HR was in the 130s-140s on arrival to
OSH.

  She also had acute renal failure on admission to the OSH. She
was continued on mIVF. Cr on presentation to [**Location (un) **] was 1.8 and
improved to 1.5 on transfer. Her atrial fibrillation is
reportedly poorly controlled, and she remains on IV amiodarone,
now transitioned to oral amiodarone, along with metoprolol and
diltiazem gtt. Initial plan was for electrical cardioversion,
but daughter requested transfer to a tertiary medical center for
this.

  Additionally, the patient had an episode of pulmonary edema on
evening prior to transfer. She reported that it was "hard to
breathe." This was suspected to be from poorly controlled heart
rate and perhaps mIVF. CXR showed bilateral pulmonary vascular
congestion. She diuresed well with 40 mg IV lasix (-1800 cc
since then). She was initially on 6L NC. She reports cough, but
no productive sputum. HR reportedly increasing to 138 bpm at
times.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI. Reports 20 lb weight loss since [**Month (only) 958**].
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies sinus tenderness,
rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies productive cough, shortness of
breath. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or
weakness. Denies vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal
pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or
urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.

OTHER RELEVANT STUDIES:
.
Images: CXR at OSH - no acute cardiopulmonary process
.
CXR [**2149-7-16**]: Heart size is enlarged with left ventricular
configuration. Mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There are
multifocal opacities noted, with some perihilar and upper lung
redistribution as well as both basal involvement. There are also
bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left. There is no
pneumothorax. The findings are worrisome for a combination of
pulmonary edema given the perihilar and upper lobar distribution
as well as multifocal infection giving relatively focal and
patchy character of the finding. Correlation with prior imaging
as well as assessment after diuresis is recommended. Surgical
clips are projecting over the right axilla and no right breast
identified, suggesting that the patient can be after right
mastectomy, please correlate with clinical history.
.
CXR [**2149-7-20**]: CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: The heart is somewhat
enlarged. There is no evidence of failure. The lung fields are
clear. The costophrenic angles are sharp. There has been a
marked improvement in the overall appearances since the prior
chest x-ray of [**7-17**]. IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly, otherwise
normal chest.
.
TTE [**2149-7-17**]: The left atrium is elongated. Th
