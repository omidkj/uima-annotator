Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Scopolamine / IV Dye, Iodine Containing / Levaquin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, Urosepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Venous Catheter Placement

History of Present Illness:
80 y/o M with PMHx significant for metastatic lung cancer,
CLL/SLL. Was found to be unresponsive, twitching, and
hypotensive at nursing home today. Was initially being brought
to [**Hospital3 **]; however, en route, BP's dropped to 55/P and he
was brought to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to the ED, the patient's VS were 94/P, 108, 20, 100%
on 4L. Temp was 99.6, but then patient spiked to 102.8. CXR
showed ? retrocardiac consolidation. Given the pt's AMS, CT head
was performed and was negative for ICH. Labs were significant
for a UA with 11-20 RBCs, >50 WBCs. Given the high suspicion for
urosepsis, the patient was given vancomycin and zosyn. There was
some uncertainty regarding the patient's code status. Per
report, his wife and daughter reported that they felt that a DNR
was warranted; however, the patient wants to remain full code.
The decision was made to hold off on central line placement and
to start treatment with peripheral pressors in the ED. He was
given IVFs (5L total) as well as started on periperal levophed.
By the time of transfer to the ICU, the patient's BP had
improved to the low 100's. VS at the time of transfer: Temp 98.7
HR 101 P 106/52 RR 18 100% on 2L.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient's VS were: T: 99.3 BP: 137/88
P: 96 R: 16 O2: 98% on 4L. The patient was moaning and coughing
and was only oriented to person. He was not able to provide much
of a history. Per his wife, the patient has been less coherent
than his baseline recently. She reports that he is normally
quite coherent. She reports that she visited him today and that
he wasn't feeling well.
.
.
Review of sytems: Unable to obtain. The patient denies any
complaints.

CXR ([**2176-7-5**]) - IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study. It is unclear
to what extent interstitial opacities are acute versus chronic.
There are likely as well accentuated by the profound low lung
volumes. There is increased opacity at the retrocardiac left
lower lobe, which may indicate a focal consolidation such as
pneumonia if truly acute. It is difficult to place these
findings in context without pulmonary symptomology. Correlate
clinically.

CT Head ([**2176-7-5**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Note that MRI is more
sensitive for ischemic process if clinical concern is high.
2. Non-contrast head CT is limited in evaluation of intracranial
metastasis. Gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI is more sensitive.
3. Likely chronic paranasal sinus disease with a component of
fungal colonization, given high atenuatin of layering internal
secretions. No
osseous changes noted.
4. Age-related involutional change.
