History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year-old gentleman who presents with 3D of
atraumatic neck, R shoulder and insidious R sided weakness,
first
arm then leg.  He denies any preceding symptoms or other
complaints.  In addition, he reports radicular pain into
bilateral hands with any neck rotation and now constant
paresthesias of all fingertips.  He has been incontinent of
urine
once; no other changes to his bowel or bladder habits.  Pain is
constant, sharp, exacerbated with any motion.  He presented to
[**Hospital6 1597**] after the weakness progressed to such a
point
that he could no longer work as a mechanic due to hand weakness
or ambulate normally due to right leg weakness.  Imaging was
concerning for pathologic fracture and he was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for definitive care. Denies fevers, chills, chest pain,
SOB, cough or weight change.

LAB:
Laboratory data was reviewed and notable for Hct=38, WBC=6

IMAGING:
MRI was reviewed and notable for multiple sites of disease in
cervical vertebral bodies and posterior elements, most
significantly at C3 where there is a pathologic fracture with
mild retropulsion.  Disease extends into the thoracic spine,
which is minimally imaged.

Imaging:
c-spine [**2-16**]: Six films from the O.R. demonstrate interval
placement of a
prosthesis at the C3 level. The alignment is near anatomic.

c-spine ct [**2-16**]: 1. Multiple lytic lesions throughout the
cervical spine with pathologic fracture at C3. Posterior bowing
and fracture fragments appear to contact the spinal cord at this
level.
2. Lytic lesion in the C5 vertebral body appears to erode
through the cortex to the left transverse foramen. In
correlation with prior MRI, there is abnormal soft tissue
surrounding the vertebral artery.
Overall, the appearance is compatible with multiple myeloma or
widespread
metastatic disease.

CXR [**2-16**]: AP chest compared to [**2-15**] and [**2-16**] at 12:12
a.m.:
With the chin slightly down, the tip of the endotracheal tube at
the thoracic inlet is no less than 6 cm from the carina. It
should be advanced 2.5 cm for more secured seating. Mild
pulmonary edema and mild bibasilar atelectasis are new. Heart
size is normal but mediastinal fullness could be due to either
dilated pulmonary artery or prevascular mediastinal mass.
Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax.

chest xray [**2-19**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
patient has improved ventilation, as reflected by larger lung
volumes. The size of the cardiac silhouette is borderline but
there is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Larger pleural
effusions. The nasogastric tube has been removed. Unchanged
appearance of the cervical stabilization devices.

LE u/s [**2-20**]:  No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower
extremities

CTA [**2-20**] 1. Acute pulmonary embolus involving the segmental
branch of right upper lobe pulmonary artery. Possible additional
acute pulmonary embolus in the right lower lobe segmental
branch.
2. A large soft tissue heterogeneously enhancing mass arising at
T7 level
extending into the posterior left hemithorax and exerting mass
effect on the descending aorta. There is apparent extension of
the mass into the central canal and bony destruction of the
adjacent vertebral body and rib and posterior elements. Further
assessment with MR may be considered, if
clinically indicated.
3. Bibasilar atelectasis.
4. Enlarged pulmonary artery, likely signifies underlying
pulmonary
hypertension.
5. Numerous lytic bony lesions, similar in appearance to
cervical spine
pathology seen on MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] C-spine of [**2194-2-15**], and likely
represent
extension of the same underlying disease process.

CT abd [**2-24**]: 1. Bibasal atelectasis. Interval resolution of left
lower lobe opacity. 4-mm pulmonary nodules bilaterally. Followup
CT chest in one year is recommended.
2. Hyperenhancing liver lesions and 1.5 cm hypodense liver
lesion without
mass effect. These most likely represent hemangiomas.
Correlation with previous outside imaging is recommended.
3. Multiple lytic lesions throughout the visualized skeleton
with a soft
tissue mass extending from T6 vertebral body involving the left
sixth rib
which is unchanged in appearance.
4. Bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.

MRI L/T spine [**2-27**]: 1. Extensive metastases along the
thoracolumbar spine, ribs, and the pelvis, corresponding to the
lytic lesions described in the recent CTA chest and CT abdomen
and pelvis.
2. No evidence of fracture or malalignment. No cord compression.
No spinal
canal narrowing. The patient remains at very high risk for
developing
pathologic fracture sec
