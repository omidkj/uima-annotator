History of Present Illness:
86yo gentleman with h/o CAD s/p CABG in [**2138**], HTN, and DM
admitted after an episode of symptomatic VTach.

Mr. [**Known lastname 52730**] was walking out of [**Company 79153**], where he works doing food
demonstration (yesterday was lemonade day), when he began to
feel faint.  He stated he was weak all over and felt short of
breath and diaphoretic.  He denies chest pain, pressure, or
palpitations.  Some coworkers came to him and helped lie him
down.  They called EMS.  Although he does not remember it, he
was told he lost consciousness.

Of note, he stopped his ASA about 2 weeks ago because of ?
hematuria.

When EMS arrived, he was noted to be in ventricular tachycardia
at 200bpm.  He abruptly converted to an accelerated junctional
rhythm in the 70s and then to sinus tachycardia per their
report.  He received ASA.

At [**Hospital3 3583**], he was given amiodarone 150mg followed by
gtt at 1mg/min.  He also received 600mg plavix and heparin gtt
was started for ? STE in V1-V2.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
because of concern for ACS.

In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], his VS were: no temp recorded  85  116/60
18  99% NRB.  He was continued on amiodarone gtt at 1mg/min.
STE were less pronounced, and after discussing with cardiology,
the patient was not felt to have ACS.  He was admitted to the
CCU for further management.

Upon presentation to the CCU, the patient stated he was feeling
well.  Although he was requiring a NRB in the ED, he was
breathing comfortably on 2L oxygen by NC.

On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.  +hematuria about 2 weeks ago.

+Dyspnea on exertion, though he walks about a mile around the
mall, only having to stop a few times.  Cardiac review of
systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, or palpitations.

Brief Hospital Course:
86yo gentleman with CAD s/p CABG in [**2138**], HTN, and DM admitted
with presyncope and wide complex tachycardia.
.
# Rhythm:
Patient presented with wide complex tachycardia. Patient's
episode was not associated with chest pain or typical anginal
symptoms, EKG changes not evolving and enzymes negative x3, so
it seemed unlikely that he had an ischemic event. It was thought
that he might have scar mediated VT. Different EKGs showed LAFB
vs. RBBB. Episodes of wide complex tachycardia while inpatient
appeared more likely consistent with SVT. However, EPS showed
inducible VT, degenerating into VF, leading to ICD placement.
ICD was interrogated by electrophysiology and found to be
functioning normally. PA/Lateral CXR was done, showing good lead
placement. He was discharged on three days of prophylactic
Keflex. Finally, his outpatient Coreg regimen was changed to
Toprol XL 100QD. A decision was made to change from carvedilol
to metoprolol because it was felt that his blood pressure was
unable to tolerate increases in carvedilol.
.
# Pump:
Patient noted to have LV systolic and diastolic failure with EF
15-20%, severe LV hypokinesis except at basal and lateral
segments, dystolic dysfunction, mild MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was initially
somewhat volume overloaded, with signs of pulmonary edema and
bibasilar crackles. He was diuresed well, responding well to
Lasix 20mg PO. He likely developed some mild pulmonary edema in
the setting of possible VT, which resolved with diuresis. By the
time of discharge, he was oxygenating well, with good oxygen
saturation on room air, and appeared fairly euvolemic. His
Diovan was initially held, but he was restarted on his
outpatient dosage of 80QD prior to discharge.
.
# CAD s/p CABG:
No signs of active ischemia were noted. No EKG changes
suggestive of ischemia were noted, and cardiac enzymes were
negative x3. His aspirin, lipitor and diovan were continued. He
was switched from carvedilol to metoprolol.
.
# ARF:
Baseline Cr unknown, creatinine while inpatient was
approximately 1.3 and fairly stable. This may have been related
to transient poor perfusion in the setting of VT. Initially,
Diovan was held, but it was restarted prior to discharge.
.
# HTN:
Beta blocker switched from Carvedilol to Metoprolol because his
blood pressure would not tolerate further increases in
carvedilol. Initially, Diovan was held, but it was restarted
prior to discharge.
.
# DM:
Metformin was held and he was covered with sliding scale
insulin.
.
# Anemia:
He was noted to be somewhat anemic, but his hematocrit was
fairly stable. This was not worked up while inpatient, but he
was advised to consider an outpatient colonoscopy following
discharge.
