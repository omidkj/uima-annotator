HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88-year-old
female who had recently undergone thoracotomy and repair of
an esophageal perforation. The patient had been sent to rehab
but had come back with fevers and shortness of breath. On CT
scan of the chest, it was evident that the patient had
bilateral lower lobe collapse and evidence of bilateral
pneumonia. The patient was begun on antibiotics and had a
bronchoscopy performed on admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the bronchoscopy, there were very
thickened and copious secretions. The patient was brought to
the intensive care unit and monitored. Over the next 3 days,
her white count went down to 12. She had intermittent fever.
Given her overall condition, however, a discussion with the
family was had. After discussion with the family and review
of the patient's condition, it was decided to take the
patient off all mechanical and vasopressor support. The
patient was transferred down to a regular nursing floor. The
patient eventually expired on [**2178-1-27**], after a
hospital stay of 1 week.
