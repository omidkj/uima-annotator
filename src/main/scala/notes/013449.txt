History of Present Illness:
56 woman with [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosone positive ALL in remission
presented to clinic with fever to 103 and BP 92/58. She was
initially diagnosed by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-/2128**] after presenting with
weakness. She  underwent induction therapy with daunorubicin,
vincristine, l-
asparaginase, and prednisone and responded well. In the past 15
months, she has received gleevec, hyper CVAD, desatinib,
rituxan, and pulse dose steroids to maintain her clinical and
cytological remission. Recently, she has been on velcade and
cytoxan, with most recent dose 4/9.

Of note, the patient complains of fevers and drenching night
sweats for the last 3 weeks. She also had a CT scan in [**Month (only) 958**]
[**2129**] to discover the etiology of her fevers. It showed ground
glass opacities and she then underwent a bronchoscopy that was
unrevealing.
.
In clinic, she was given 100mg IV hydrocortisone, Ertapenem 1gm
IV, tylenol 650mg po after blood and urine cultures obtained.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 woman with [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosone positive ALL in remission
presented to clinic with hypotension and fevers.
.
Hypotension: The patient presented with systolic blood pressure
in the high 70s to 80s that was minimally responsive to fluids.
She received stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8)
and spent one night in the ICU, not requiring pressors. She did
not have symptoms of lightheadedness or change in mental status
and over the course of her stay her blood pressure returned to
her baseline of 90s to low 100s.
.
Fever: The patient presented with high spiking fevers to 102s.
These fevers continued for a full week into her stay and were
often accompanied by severe chills, fatigue and in general a
"toxic" looking appearance. Although she was not neutropenic,
she was started on broad antibiotic coverage, including
vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl given her history of C.Diff, and
caspofungin. She was also receiving her standing prophylactic
dose of oral vanco and had been receiving monthly pentamidine.
Her admission CT chest actually showed an improvement in her
ground glass lung opacities from previously and given that she
had had a negative BAL within the last month, PCP was [**Name9 (PRE) 1801**]
thought to be a low probability.
Given the lack of improvement on antibiotics and the negative
cultures, the fevers were thought most likely due to either
Velcade (last dose on [**5-9**]) or desatinib. However, the duration
and lack of improvement was thought unusual for Velcade and the
fevers did not improve when her desatinib was held for 4 days.
Eventually a b-glucan test was found to be significantly
positive, when tests from previous hospitalizations had only
been "intermediate." She then had a repeat CT of the chest which
showed worsening ground glass in the upper lobes. She was
started on treatment dose Bactrim and her Fevers immediately
subsided (see ID).
.
ID: ID consult service was involved and based on beta-glucan and
CT findings and resolution of fevers on Bactrim, determined that
the diagnosis could be made without doing another bronchoscopy.
She was started on Bactrim 2 DS tabs TID and prednisone 40 mg
[**Hospital1 **]. Within two days of starting the bactrim, her LFTs had
climbed from a normal level to a maximum of ALT 433, AST 336
(the LFTs continued to rise for a day after the bactrim had been
stopped). On discharge the LFTs had trended downward for 48
hours and on discharge were ALT 317, AST 150. She was switched
from the Bactrim to Clindamycin Q6 and primaquine 15 mg QD
dosing and had been on these medications for >48hrs prior to
discharge with no fevers. She was discharged on a three week
course of this regimen, with an increase in her PO vanco to 125
Q6H given her past history of Cdiff. The patient was also
discharged on a quick taper of steroids from 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] to a
standing dose of 10 mg QD, to be continued on an ongoing basis
until further adjusted by her outpatient oncologist. A longer
taper of high dose steroids was not considered necessary given
her good O2 sats, no desatting on ambulation, and not as much
data on this protocol in non-HIV patients.
.
ALL: The patient had her Dasatinib held for roughly 4 days to
rule out drug related fever but was discharged on her normal
dose of 70 mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
CHF: The patient's cardiac medications, metoprolol and
lisinopril, were held when she presented with hypotension. These
were not restarted on her discharge from the hospital, as she
had relatively low blood pressures (<120) and was still being
actively treated for infection. These long-term benefit
medications could be restarted as desired by her outpatient
HCPs.
