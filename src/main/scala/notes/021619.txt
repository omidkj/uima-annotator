Service:  Cardiothoracic

CHIEF COMPLAINT/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is
an 85 year old male with known coronary artery disease and
history of myocardial infarction in [**2089**] who presented to an
outside hospital with a complaint of shortness of breath and
dyspnea on exertion.  An echocardiogram at the outside
hospital demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45% with mitral
regurgitation 2 to 3+ as well as inferior, posterior
hypokinesis.  He had computerized tomographic angiography
which demonstrated no pulmonary embolus.  Dobutamine stress
demonstrated large anterior apical inferior, posterior and
lateral reversible defects.  Chest x-ray also done at the
outside hospital showed right middle lobe infiltrates.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for cardiac catheterization.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data at the time of transfer
revealed white count 8.2, hematocrit 34.2, platelets 195,
sodium 138, potassium 4.5, chloride 101, carbon dioxide 32,
BUN 18, creatinine 1.3, glucose 118, CPK prior to admission
on [**462-12-13**], on [**413-12-14**], on [**394-12-17**]
and on [**394-12-19**].  Troponins are all less than .04
except for on [**12-13**], they were 0.05.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory, please see catheterization report
or full details.  In summary the catheterization report
showed normal left main with left anterior descending 80%
occlusion, circumflex 70% occlusion and right coronary artery
totally occluded.  Post cardiac catheterization,
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted.  In summary, the
patient was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting at a
later date following a complete workup including carotid
dopplers, pulmonary function tests, and echocardiogram to
assess left ventricular function as well as his mitral
regurgitation and resolution of his right middle lobe
infiltrates as well as diuresis prior to his surgery.  The
patient was maintained on the Medical Service prior to his
surgery during his preoperative testing.  On [**12-20**], he
experienced an episode of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.  At that time he was seen by the
electrophysiology service who recommended that the patient be
loaded with amiodarone and started on heparin.  On [**12-23**] the patient complained of abdominal pain.  Following his
complaint of abdominal pain he had decreasing level of
consciousness followed by a cardiac arrest during which he
had periods of asystole, lasting six to eight seconds.
During that time he was pulseless.  He did rule in for a
non-Q wave myocardial infarction following his cardiac
arrest.  A temporary pacing wire was placed and he was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for continued
monitoring prior to his coronary artery bypass grafting.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was further complicated by an
episode of ventricular tachycardia during which the patient
was pulseless.  This occurred on [**12-26**].  The patient
was shocked out of the ventricular tachycardia with 300
joules followed by ventricular pacing with the temporary wire
he had in place.  The following morning, [**12-27**], the
patient was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent
an off-pump coronary artery bypass graft times one with a
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
please see the operation report for full details.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and he was transferred
from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit.  At the time of transfer, the patient's mean arterial
pressure was 70, central venous pressure was 12, he was
ventricularly paced at a rate of 70.  He had a propofol at 20
mcg/kg/min and Neosynephinre at 0.3 mcg/kg/min.  The patient
did well in the immediately postoperative period.  He
remained on his Neosynephrine infusion to keep his mean
arterial pressure greater than 70.  He remained intubated
throughout postoperative day #1 in anticipation of an
angioplasty to be done on postoperative day #1.

As stated, the patient was brought to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory on postoperative day #1.  At that
time his coronary arteries were again studied.  The
catheterization showed his left anterior descending to have
an 80% occlusion with competitive flow distally, circumflex
and obtuse marginal 1 to be 80% occluded and the right
coronary artery to be 100% occluded with proximal filling via
left to right collaterals.  His left internal mammary artery
to the left anterior descending was widely patent with normal
flow.  At that time he underwent an angioplasty of his obtuse
marginal 1 lesion.  The lesion was crossed and stented with
no residual lesion.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well, please see the catheterization report for full details.
Following the catheterization and stenting the patient was
transferred from the Catheterization Laboratory to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  Upon arrival the
patient's sedation was discontinued.  He was weaned from his
ventilator and ultimately extubated.  For the next 48 hours
the patient remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit, monitoring his hemodynamic stability and his
respiratory status.  On postoperative day #4 the patient was
transferred to Far 6 for continuing postoperative care and
cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next several days the
patient remained on the Cardiothoracic Step Down Floor.  His
activity level was slowly increased with the aid of physical
therapy and the nursing staff.  He continued to be followed
by the Electrophysiology Service and on postoperative day #10
he was brought to the Electrophysiology Suite where he
underwent electrophysiology studies and automatic implanted
cardioverter defibrillator placement.  Please see
electrophysiology study report for full details.  The patient
remained on Cardiothoracic Step Down Floor for two additional
days at which time he was deemed stable and ready for
transfer to rehabilitation.

At the time of transfer to rehabilitation, the patient's
physical examination is as follows:  Vital signs temperature
97.7, heartrate 67, ventricularly paced, blood pressure
145
