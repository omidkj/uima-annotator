History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19219**] is a 63 year old male with a history of GERD and
Barrett's esophagus for which he was undergoing surveillance
endoscopy. He was found to have an adenocarcinoma within an
esophageal nodule near the GE junction. He underwent EUS on [**4-21**]
which noted a 1cm malignant appearing lesion at the GE junction
without evidence of invasion beyond the mucosal layer. A single
0.7 x 0.8 cm lymph node was seen in the periesophageal region
which was sampled via FNA. LN negative for malignancy. The
patient underwent endoscopic mucosal resection on [**2107-5-12**] with
pathology as low grade well to moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma, at least intramucosal, multifocally extending to
specimen margins with concern for invasion, possibly into the
muscularis mucosae. He presents to discuss the possibility of
surgical resection.

Mr. [**Known lastname 19219**] explains that he had some mild heartburn in the past
but has difficulty remembering exactly when he was first started
on antacid medication. He reports having been followed with
serial endoscopy for at least 3-5 years for what sounds like
Barrett's esophagus likely found at the time of his initial GI
workup in the past. The cancer was diagnosed on recent
surveillance EGD.

The patient complains of a 15 pound weight loss and significant
anxiety which began upon learning his diagnosis. Otherwise he
denies reflux, dysphagia, odynophagia, heartburn, nausea,
shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, chest pain. Eating and
drinking well. Denies heart disease, MI, has never needed oxygen
therapy, never been hospitalized, never taken inhalers or
steroids for his lungs. He has a heavy smoking history, having
quit 2 weeks ago. Also a heavy drinking history, sober for last
20 years. The patient states that he hopes to have surgery as
soon as possible.

[**2107-7-2**] Ba swallow :
Status post esophagectomy with gastric pull-through, without
evidence of holdup or leak at the neogastroesophageal junction

[**2107-7-3**] CXR :

The right-sided chest tube has been removed.  Emphysematous
changes
in the lungs are again visualized.  There is improved aeration
in the left
lower lung with decreased effusion; however, there continues to
be some
retrocardiac volume loss.  Old rib fractures on the right are
again seen


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19219**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent a laparoscopic esophagectomy.
He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in
stable condition.  He maintained stable hemodynamics and his
pain was well controlled with a thoracic epidural catheter.  His
tube feedings were started via J tube on post op day #1 and he
was eventually cycled over 18 hours.

He was able to use his incentive spirometer effectively and his
oxygen was gradually weaned off with room air saturations of
94%.  His epidural was removed and he was treated with oxycodone
for pain via the j tube.

A barium swallow was done on post op day #6 which confirmed no
anastomotic leak and he began a liquid diet which he tolerated
well.  Unfortunately his J tube site started to leak some
purulent material and some erythema was noted around the tube.
The J tube was removed on [**2107-7-4**] and his diet was advanced to
soft solids along with Ensure supplements which he continued to
tolerate well.

The j tube site had a 1 cm area of cellulitis around the
insertion site and was I&D'd at the bedside with placement of a
wick.  He was also placed on Keflex and the wound was monitored
for another 24 hours.  The area receded a bit and he continued
to undergo [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes.  He remained afebrile and his
pain at the J tube site decreased.

He was up and walking independently and continued to increase
his oral intake with soft food and supplements.  He was
discharged to home on [**2107-7-6**] with VNA services and he will
follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 1 week.
