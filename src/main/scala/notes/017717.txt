Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo F with HTN, skin melanoma in [**2153**] and skin squamous cell
cancer in [**2155**] who developed new onset jaundice, nausea with
vomiting and was found to have a cystic pancreatic mass at OSH.
.
# CMO: Patient was made comfort measure after discussion with
family. Palliative care saw patient and it was decided that she
would go home with hospice care. She was comfortable at the time
of discharge. She was sent home on oxycodone, zofran,
promethazine, compazine, & ativan for symptom management.
Patient medications were reviewed and non-palliative medications
were removed from regimen. We called the PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] couple of times
during this stay and were only able to reach his answering
machine. We left messages with the new changes in care goals and
with numbers for him to contact us. Family (very involved) has
also said that they will be in touch with her PCP as well. She
will continue to have her foley and oxygen with N as needed at
home, which hospice can provide.
.
#bile duct obstruction with obstructive jaundice/cystic
pancreatic head lesion-Etiology of patients symptoms, abdominal
distention, nausea, jaundice is likely related to obstruction
from pancreatic head mass. DDX includes malignancy vs. cyst. Pt
does have h.o skin cancer, but unlikely to metastasize to
pancreas. Pt may also have stricture or stones. She had an ERCP
with 8cm by 10mm Wallflex fully covered biliary stent which was
successfully placed with large amounts of mucin which drained.
Patient presented with nausea and continued to have nausea
intermittently throughout stay. Have increased regimen as above
to control nausea, able to tolerate PO meds, gingerale, and some
soft foods.
.
#Hypoxia-?LLL infiltrate--Pt thought to have PNA at OSH. CXR
found streaky LLL infiltrate. Pt does have a leukocytosis, but
denies cough. On exam, pt with elevated JVP/crackles more c/w
volume overload. Pt does have suspicion of malignancy, and will
consider if continued hypoxia. Will continue to cover for
suspected pna including atypicals with levofloxacin to end on
[**2156-10-5**]. Able to tolerate PO so will go home with PO regimen.
.
#Transient bacteremia s/p ERCP: will treat with flagyl in
addition to levoflox as above for total of 2 wk course, to end
on [**2156-10-5**]. have been tolerating PO as well.
.
#h.o skin cancer/squamous cell/melanoma--stable, will f/u outpt
if necessary but CMO at this point
.
#Afib: patient found to have atrial fibrillation [**2-25**] to
procedure, which has resolved and has not recurred. No need for
any anticoagulation especially given goals of care.
.
#Hypothyroidism: will continue home levothyroxine as it might
help patient feel better, more energetic.
.
#code-DNR/DNI, CMO, d/w patient in presence of HCP.
