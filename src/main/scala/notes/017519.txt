History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
.
81 y.o. M with CAD, s/p atrial closure surgery, h/o BPH s/p TURP
who presented to [**Hospital1 **] last week with an acute on chronic
systolic CHF exacerbation and weight gain requiring
thoracentesis of 2L of fluid.  Patient has been having
progressively worsening heart failure symptoms over last 9
months.  He has recently moved here from [**Country 4194**] 5 months ago.
Patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible
MVR/TVR and/or CABG depending on cath results. Patient also
unable to lay flat for cardiac catherization

Patient's course was complicated by hematuria requiring urology
evaluation and subsequently patient is being transfered to
cardiology service for further workup.  He has been gently
diuresed with IV lasix during his CSRU stay.  Patien also had L
femoral triple lumen catheter inserted.  He is transfered to
medicine service for continued CHF management.

As far as the hematuria, course at OSH was complicated by
traumatic foley insertion.  A foley was placed with a urologist
assistance after he performed a cystoscopy to place a Couniltip
catheter over a wire as there were multiple false passages and
urethral trauma causing hematuria.  Patient continued to have
gross hematuria with clots especially since heparin gtt was
instituted for management of Afib.

Pertinent Results:
Diagnostic Imaging:
[**2130-10-16**].Echo.
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior akinesis and focal distal septal
hypokinesis. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2130-11-1**].  Cardiac cath.
COMMENTS:
1.  Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right sided
filling
pressures, with RVEDP of 17 mm Hg and mean RA pressure of 16 mm
Hg.
There was moderate to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension
with PA
pressure 64/27 mm Hg.  The cardiac index was preserved at 3
l/min/m2.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial
pressure of
115/46 mm Hg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Elevated cardiac filling pressures.
2. Moderate to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
.
Renal Ultrasound. [**2130-10-23**].
IMPRESSION:  Large simple cysts on the left and on the right a
septated cyst as well as multiple cysts TSTC by US; likely
simple cysts.
.
[**2130-10-21**] Tib/Fib XRAY
IMPRESSION:  Normal radiographic appearance with no evidence for
osteomyelitis.
.
[**2130-10-23**] Urine Cytology
 ATYPICAL.  Rare atypical urothelial cells present singly.
.
[**2130-10-23**] CT HEAD:
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses,
mass effect, or
major vascular territorial infarction. A small chronic left
occipital pole
infarct is seen, as well as probable chronic infarcts in the
region of the
posterior limb of the right internal capsule and subinsular
white matter.  The ventricles and sulci are unremarkable. Age-
related changes are noted.  No fractures are identified.
Scattered ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening is
noted, likely a chronic inflammatory process. The sinuses are
otherwise
unremarkable. The visualized orbits are normal.
.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial pathology. Probable multiple
chronic
infarcts, as noted above.
.
[**2130-10-28**] CT HEAD:
FINDINGS: Nsignificant interval change from [**2130-10-23**]
without evidence for intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage or mass
effect.  There is mild brain atrophy and a small lacunar infarct
in the right thalamus/posterior limb of the internal capsule as
well as further periventricular white matter hypodensities that
are sequelae of chronic small vessel infarction.  There is no
evidence for fracture.
.
IMPRESSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
.
[**2130-11-1**] Right Heart Catheterization
COMMENTS:
1.  Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right sided
filling
pressures, with RVEDP of 17 mm Hg and mean RA pressure of 16 mm
Hg.
There was moderate to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension
with PA
pressure 64/27 mm Hg.  The cardiac index was preserved at 3
l/min/m2.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial
pressure of
115/46 mm Hg.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Elevated cardiac filling pressures.
2. Moderate to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
.
[**2130-11-3**] Pleural Fluid Cytology:
 Pleural fluid:
 	
 	NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
 	
 	Virtually acellular specimen with abundant proteinaceous
 	debris, red blood cell fragments and extremely rare benign-
 	appearing cells, likely histiocytes, mesothelial cells and
 	lymphocytes.
.
.
[**2130-11-6**] CXR portable:
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions greater on the right side
are unchanged from [**11-5**], increased from [**11-3**].  Left
lower lobe atelectasis is persistent.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
unchanged.  The right IJ tip is in the cavoatrial junction,
unchanged.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.  ET
tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.  Mild pulmonary edema is
stable.
.
[**2130-11-3**] Left Ankle Xray
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**2130-10-21**], there is no
interval
change.  Specifically, no evidence of bone erosion.
.
[**2130-11-11**] CXR portable
FINDINGS:  A single portable image of the chest was obtained and
compared to the prior examination dated [**2130-11-9**] demonstrating
no significant interval change.  Moderate-sized bilateral
pleural effusions persist.  There is persistent perihilar
fullness associated with indistinct bronchopulmonary vasculature
with an appearance most consistent with underlying edema.  The
right internal jugular central venous line and right PICC line
are grossly unchanged and in satisfactory position.  The bony
thorax is grossly intact.
