CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 78 year old female with a
past medical history significant for obstructive sleep apnea,
pulmonary hypertension, chronic hypercapnic and hypoxemic
respiratory failure, who presented with worsening shortness
of breath and decreased oxygen saturation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year old
woman with a history of long-standing obstructive sleep apnea
and subsequent pulmonary hypertension.  Two days prior to
admission, the patient reported experiencing gradual
worsening shortness of breath.  On the morning of admission,
the patient's daughter found the patient severely short of
breath, cyanotic and called EMS.  When EMS arrived, the
patient was noted to have a room air oxygen saturation in the
60% range and she was noted to be tachypneic with a
respiratory rate in the 40s.

Upon arrival in the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be cyanotic
and her vital signs showed a heart rate of 85, blood pressure
175/77, respiratory rate 32, and she was saturating at 97% on
100% nonrebreather face mask.  She denied any chest pain at
the time of Emergency Department presentation.  She denied
any [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 691**] fever or chills.  She denied any nausea or
vomiting.  There was no abdominal pain.  She denied any
urinary symptoms, and she denied any symptoms of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.

The patient was placed on full face mask BIPAP and was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for monitoring of
her respiratory status.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Obstructive sleep apnea. This was diagnosed at least five
years prior to the time of admission when sleep studies
performed in [**2098-2-17**], showed 43 hypopneas and oxygen
saturation in the 70s.  This data was from records provided
by the patient's primary pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10132**], from [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center. At home, the patient wore CPAP
for four to six hours every night and received oxygen via
nasal cannula at a rate of 2 to 2.5 liters per minute during
the day.
2.  Chronic hypercapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure.  The
patient had room air oximetry studies performed in [**2102-7-21**], again at an outpatient hospital which showed that she
spent approximately 63% of her time with oxygen saturation in
the 90s, 24% of her time with oxygen saturation in the 80s
and 5% of her time with oxygen saturation in the 70s.
3.  Restrictive lung disease.
4.  Pulmonary hypertension.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
catheterization in [**2097-10-18**], which showed clean coronary
arteries.
7.  Status post inferior myocardial infarction approximately
fifteen years ago.
8.  Inguinal hernia.
9.  Chronic anemia thought to be due to Vitamin B12
deficiency.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lasix 40 mg q.d.
2.  Atenolol 25 mg once a day.
3.  Nitroglycerin patch 0.4 mg transdermal patch applied once
a day.
4.  Carvedilol 3.125 mg once a day.
5.  Allopurinol.

ALLERGIES:  Reported allergies were to Penicillin and
Streptomycin.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Not assessed.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a Russian speaking woman who
had come to the United States from [**Country 532**] eight years ago.
She lives alone in the [**Location (un) 86**] area but had two daughters who
lived nearby.  She had no history of tobacco use and no
history of exposure to asbestos or known industrial agents.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  When we examined the patient, her
vital signs revealed a heart rate of 48, blood pressure
89/48, respiratory rate 26, oxygen saturation 92% on BIPAP
face mask with a pressure support of 15, PEEP of 5 and FIO2
of 40%.  She was noted to be awake, alert and able to respond
to questions with the help of translation.  Her skin
examination was notable for pallor but no cyanosis.
Examination of the jugular venous distention revealed jugular
venous pulse of 9.0 centimeters.  Her chest examination
showed diffusely decreased breath sounds, decreased more so
on the left side than on the right side, however, there were
no wheezes or crackles noted.  Her cardiac examination
revealed a bradycardic heart rate but at a regular rhythm
with a harsh IV/VI systolic murmur heard across the
precordium, an occasional S3 but no rubs.  Her abdominal
examination revealed normoactive bowel sounds, obese but soft
abdomen, which was nontender.  There was no costovertebral
angle tenderness.  Examination of her extremities showed
dorsalis pedis pulses 1+ bilaterally.  Her extremities were
warm.  There was 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema.  She was
also noted to have bilateral calf tenderness.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, sodium 142, initial potassium
of 7.0 in a hemolyzed specimen with a repeat potassium of
4.9, chloride 96, bicarbonate 37, blood urea nitrogen 23,
creatinine 0.8, and glucose of 151.  Her complete blood count
revealed a white blood cell count of 6.9, hematocrit 37.5,
and platelet count of 357,000.  The white blood cell count
differential included 72% polys, 20 lymphocytes and 7
monocytes.  Her coagulation panel showed a prothrombin time
of 13.0, partial thromboplastin time of 29.1 and INR of 1.2.
Initial CK level was 65.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 78
beats per minute with some right axis deviation and right
bundle branch block which was unchanged from previous
electrocardiogram provided from outside hospital.

A chest x-ray showed opacification at the right mediastinal
border and prominent pulmonary vasculature but no focal
consolidation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, an initial
arterial blood gas was performed with the patient on 100%
nonrebreather face mask.  This blood gas revealed a pH 7.19,
pCO2 122, and pO2 of 150.  After the patient was placed on a
face mask with 50% FIO2, a repeat blood gas showed a pH of
7.13, pCO2 of 137, and pO2 of 132.  The patient was given a
single dose of Levofloxacin in the Emergency Department to
treat for community acquired pneumonia.  She was also given
intravenous Solu-Medrol to treat for any underlying
bronchospastic component contributing to her pulmonary
decompensation.  She was given 1 mg of Morphine Sulfate and
also Nitroglycerin paste in the Emergency Department.

At the time of her Emergency Department presentation, the
patient reported a DNR/DNI code status.  Therefore,
intubation was not attempted in this patient.  Instead, full
face mask was the preferred method of oxygen delivery and she
was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
monitoring of her oxygenation and ventilatory status.

On the evening of admission, ultrasound studies of the lower
extremities were performed and revealed no evidence of deep
vein thrombosis.  The patient was also diuresed with Lasix,
having received a total of 100 mg intravenous Lasix in the
Emergency Department and an additional 40 mg of Lasix after
admission to the Intensive Care Unit.  This produced a net
diuresis of negative two liters on the evening of admission.
Further antibiotics were held at this time as the patient was
afebrile and did not have an elevated white blood cell count
and there was low clinical suspicion for pneumonia.  Further
steroids were also held.

Overnight, the patient's oxygenation and ventilatory status
improved somewhat based on repeat arterial blood gas
analysis.  She was placed on nasal CPAP overnight.  She
subsequently ruled out for myocardial infarction via cardiac
enzymes.

On [**2103-7-25**], hospital day two, an echocardiogram was obtained
in order to assess the possible role of diastolic congestive
heart failure contributing to pulmonary edema and the
patient's shortness of breath.  Following the echocardiogram
which was performed at the bedside, the patient experienced a
desaturation with oxygen saturation noted to be in the 30 to
40% range. The patient was noted to be profoundly cyanotic
and also began to report left sided chest pain.  An
electrocardiogram was obtained and showed no changes
suggestive of acute ischemia.  Stat portable chest x-ray also
showed no acute change from prior chest
