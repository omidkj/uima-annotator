Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**]
Chief Complaint:
fever/hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 62M with hx of schizophrenia, dementia, recurrent pneumonia
 presents to the ER with worsening shortness of breath x 1 day.
Per transfer notes, pt was found to be febrile this am to 101
(rectal) with pulse of 103, RR 44 and O2 of 89% on 2L.  He was
given a duoneb for wheezing and tylenol for the fever and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Of note, pt was recently hospitalized at
both [**Hospital1 2177**] and NEBH for pneumonia.  He was found down at his
nursing home on [**8-16**] with a swollen right shoulder.  He was
taken to [**Hospital1 2177**] and diagnosed with a RLL PNA and a right humeral
neck fracture.  He was initially started on levaquin but then
switched to Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia.  He received 14 days
of vancomycin through a L-sided PICC (last dose on [**2199-8-30**]).  A
repeat CXR on [**9-4**] showed a persistent right basilar infiltrate
and he was started on clindamycin.  On [**9-6**], pt was found to be
lethargic with a temp of 101.7 and O2 sat of 82% on 2L.   He was
then admitted to NEBH and started on linezolid.  This was
continued for 14 days and finished on [**9-18**].  Also during this
admission, pt had a PEG tube placed due to chronic dysphagia and
dehydration (cr to 2.0).  He was discharged back to his nursing
home on [**9-13**] and was doing well until the day prior to
admission.
.
In the ER, pt was 88% on 6L.  He was given combivent nebs x 3,
steroids, ceftriaxone/vanc(given hx of MRSA) and he improved to
100% on 2L.  A CTA was done given his tachypnea and it showed no
PE but bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis vs
infiltrate on the right.  It also showed his right humeral neck
fracture.

Past Medical History:
* Dementia
* Schizophrenia
* hx of recurrent pneumonia, most recently treated in [**8-23**] with
linezolid (finished on [**9-18**])
* Insulin dependent diabetes
* HTN
* COPD/emphysema on 92-93% on 2L chronically
* high cholesterol

Social History:
- lives at [**Hospital **] Health Care Center

Family History:
not obtainable [**12-20**] mental status

Physical Exam:
Exam: temp 101.2 --> 99, BP 128/89, HR 96, R 23, O2 98% on 2L
--> 93% on RA, I/O: 2.2/320
Gen: awake, tracking across the room with his eyes, nonverbal
HEENT: MM dry, PERRL, EOMI
Neck: rigid, no appreciable JVD
CV: tachy, regular, no murmurs
Chest: crackles throughout, no wheezes
Abd: PEG tube in place, site appears clean/dry/intact;
nontender, nondistended, +BS
ext: no edema, 2+DP; rigid, increased tone in all ext
neuro: nonverbal at baseline, rigid extremities, hyperreflexic
R>L; upgoing toes bilaterally, not following commands

Pertinent Results:
CXR: Cardiomegaly.  Congestive heart failure.  The underlying
infectious process cannot be excluded.
.
CTA chest:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive
atelectasis versus infiltrates.
3.  Prominent bilateral hilar and subcarinal soft tissue likely
represents lymphadenopathy.
4.  Comminuted, impacted fracture of the right humeral neck,
incompletely evaluated on this CT of the chest. Recommend plain
films of right shoulder.
5.  Cardiomegaly with moderate coronary artery atherosclerotic
calcifications.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) RESP:  Pt presents with recently with recurring pneumonia in
RLL s/p ~1 month of antibiotic treatment, presenting now with
recurrent fevers, increased work of breathing and hypoxia.  (of
note, at baseline, pt is 92-93% on 2L).  Ddx included new
pneumonia, partially treated PNA over past month, aspiration
PNA, loculated pleural effusion (although pt's effusions were
not felt to be substantial effusion on bedside USN [**9-26**] AM).
CHF and COPD flare were felt unlikely given lack of wheezing,
good air movement, and impression that pt was hypovolemic.  Pt
was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  PE unlikely given negative
CTA.
.
Pt was put on empiric antibiotics with cefepime and vanco.
Micro work up revealed klebsiella in sputum so pt was continued
on cefepime only for a 7 day course.  With this, his fevers
resolved.  His oxygenation improved as well.  He was ruled out
for Tb with AFB sputum x 3 (negative).
.
CTA of chest did reveal lymphadenopathy.  Initial consideration
was for bronch but given active pneumonia, pulmonary consult
recommended waiting 6-8 weeks to see if lymphadenopathy resolves
with resolution of pneumonia.  (Pt was seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 513**]).  If lymphaden persistes, pt can be
referred to pulm for possible bronchoscopy.
.
2) C DIFF:  Checked given fever and came back positive.  Started
on flagyl.  Last day will of 2 week course will be [**10-10**].
.
3) CHF:  Pt did appear volume overloaded after initial ICU
course and volume repletion.  Echo showed severely depressed EF
of 20-25% and PA HTN, which were known previously.  Pt was
periodically diuresed with lasix.  He was started on ACE-I,
continued on beta blocker.  He was not discharged with any
standing lasix.
.
4) Anemia:  Hct ranged between 23 and 30 while at NEBH.  Most
recent hct from nursing home was 32.9 on [**9-18**].  During the last
week of hospitalization, Hct stable in 29-30 range.  Restarted
outpt iron.
.
5) Fracture of humerus: Appeared to be old (dating back to
[**8-17**]); spoke with ortho [**9-25**] who recommended plain films which
showed callus formation suggesting prior injury.  Pt can f/u
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of ortho ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1228**]) after discharge.
.
6) Schizophrenia:  Continued on risperdal.
.
7) CODE STATUS: FULL
