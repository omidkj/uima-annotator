Admission Date:  [**2142-7-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-8-10**]


Service:

The patient was admitted on [**7-27**] to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for increasing shortness of breath and observation
for possible elective intubation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was an 80-year-old
male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and a recent diagnosis of vasculitis, possibly Wegener's
vasculitis.  His vasculitis had been diagnosed 3-4 months
prior to admission when the patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 14475**] for a presumed pneumonia.  While in
the hospital the patient apparently developed myalgias and
elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, elevated creatine
kinase levels and elevated white blood cell count and signs
of liver and renal failure.  Two lymph node biopsies and skin
biopsies were performed and the results were thought to be
consistent with a lymphocytoblastic vasculitis, possibly
Wegener's vasculitis.  The patient was, at this time, begun
on Cytoxan and high dose steroid therapy with good results
and was discharged home.  Approximately 6 weeks prior to his
[**Hospital1 **] admission.  On the day prior to his
admission he noticed worsening shortness of breath.  He
visited his PCP and [**Name Initial (PRE) **] routine CBC showed a white blood cell
count of 1,000.  At this time the patient was asked to stop
taking his Cytoxan, however, he noted worsening shortness of
breath and was transported to the [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Room by ambulance on [**7-27**].  At
presentation he was found to have interstitial infiltrates on
chest x-ray, a white blood cell count of 0.2 with no
neutrophils and in the Emergency Room was begun on
Ceftazidime, Bactrim and Solu-Medrol and was admitted to the
MICU for close observation of respiratory status.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Included chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, Wegener's vasculitis, steroid induced diabetes
mellitus, no history of coronary artery disease.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Cytoxan 50 mg q d, Prednisone 50
mg q d, Glucophage 850 mg tid, Prevacid 30 mg q d, Rocaltrol
25 mg q d, Procrit, Glyburide 5 mg tid which had recently
been discontinued.

ALLERGIES:  The patient reported an allergy to Penicillin.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient was unable to provide a family
history.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient reported that his lived with his
wife in [**Name (NI) 1268**].  The couple had no children.

SUBSTANCE ABUSE:  Notable for a 100 pack year history of
tobacco use with the patient having quit smoking
approximately 30 years ago.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for three days of dyspnea on
exertion and fevers and chills on the day prior to admission.
There had been no recent weight changes, no change in the
patient's urinary habits, no change in the patient's bowel
movements and no nausea or vomiting.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission the patient
was noted to be an elderly, thin white male lying in a
stretcher in mild distress.  His vital signs showed a
temperature of 100.2, heart rate 130, blood pressure 100/63,
respiratory rate 24.  Oxygen saturation was 94% on a 12
liters O2 face mask.  His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
exam was notable for pupils which were 3 mm and minimally
reactive.  There was no cervical lymphadenopathy.  His lungs
revealed coarse breath sounds on the right side, rhonchi and
faint coarse wheezes bilaterally.  There were coarse crackles
at both lung bases with crackles greater on the right than on
the left.  His cardiac exam revealed tachycardic rhythm and
normal S1 and S2, no murmurs were appreciated and there was
no jugulovenous distension.  His abdominal exam showed a soft
abdomen with active bowel sounds.  There was no tenderness or
abdominal distention noted.  On extremity exam there was no
lower extremity edema and fair distal pulses bilaterally.
Neurologic exam showed the cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.  Strength was [**4-14**] throughout all four extremities.
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and symmetric throughout and the
patient was alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission showed white blood cell count
of 0.2, hematocrit 41.9, platelet count 330,000.  On the
differential there were no neutrophils, 75 lymphocytes, 19
monocytes and 6 others.  His electrolytes were notable for
sodium of 137, potassium 4.8, chloride 96, CO2 23, BUN 36,
creatinine 1.3 and glucose of 224.  CK level was 16. Troponin
level was less than 0.3 and arterial blood gas showed a PH of
7.40, PCO2 40 and PO2 of 77 taken on 12 liters face mask.  An
EKG showed a rate of 180 beats/minute, possibly with
suggestions of multifocal atrial tachycardia.  There was no
ability to assess the ST-T waves secondary to wandering
baseline on the EKG.  His chest x-ray, as mentioned, showed
bilateral interstitial opacity and blunting of the right
costophrenic angle.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medical
Intensive Care Unit for monitoring of respiratory status with
diagnoses of pneumonia and neutropenia.  At the time of
admission the following major issues were addressed:

1.  Pneumonia.  The patient was placed on broad spectrum
antibiotic coverage for pneumonia including Ceftazidime and
Bactrim.  Induced sputum were obtained for gram stain culture
and analysis for PCP.

2.  Cardiac.  The patient was placed on Verapamil to control
his heart rate.

3.  Neutropenia.  At the time of admission the patient's
neutropenia was thought to be attributable to his Cytoxan and
Prednisone use.  These two medications were held at the time
of admission and hematology was consulted to assess the
benefit of beginning the patient on GCSF to assist in
resolution of his neutropenia.

4.  Endocrine.  Given the patient's prolonged outpatient
steroid course of several months, there was concern that he
might be developing some adrenal insufficiency.  The patient
was therefore placed on Prednisone at a dose of 50 mg daily
at the time of admission.

Over the course of the next several days the patient
continued to develop worsening respiratory status.  He was on
neutropenic precautions and was begun on GCSF.  His
antibiotic coverage was broadened to include Vancomycin
beginning on [**7-28**].  On [**7-31**] the patient was placed on bi-pap
to assist in his breathing.  An echocardiogram was also
obtained on this date to assess the role of potential
congestive heart failure in contributing to his shortness of
breath.  The echocardiogram showed a relatively well
preserved ejection fraction of between 45 and 55%.  On [**8-1**] a
hematology consult concurred that the patient's neutropenia
was likely secondary to his outpatient Cytoxan use and
recommended that this medication should continue to be held
during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course.  At this time the
patient's platelet count was also noted to be 48, down from
330 at the time of admission, several days previous.  On [**8-2**]
a rheumatology consult was obtained.  Rheumatology
recommended continuing the patient's steroid dose and also
assisted in obtaining outside hospital records to clarify the
patient's diagnosis of vasculitis.  Also on [**8-2**] the patient
had a bronchoscopy performed.  Bronchoscopy showed friable
airways with mucopurulent discharge.  A bronchoalveolar
lavage was also obtained.  Overnight, however, on [**8-2**] the
patient's respiratory and cardiopulmonary status further
declined.  The patient was placed on Dopamine to support his
blood pressure and he ultimately required intubation
overnight.  On [**8-3**] the patient's Bactrim was discontinued
out of concern that this medication may as well be
contributing to his thrombocytopenia and the patient was
placed on Pentamidine to treat possible PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2**].  A
chest CT performed that day showed a multifocal pneumonia.
On [**8-4**] the patient spiked new fevers in the MICU and
cultures were obtained.  In addition, an induced sputum
culture from [**8-2**] returned results that showed yeast in the
sputum.  The patient was begun on AmBisome and infectious
disease consult was obtained.  Infectious disease recommended
continuing AmBisome as the yeast was suspicious for invasive
