Imaging:
.
[**4-3**] CXR: CHF, no PNA
.
[**4-3**] ABD XR: MPRESSION: Dilated loops of small bowel with
multiple "step-ladder" fluid levels, and paucity of large bowel
gas, highly concerning for small bowel obstruction; adynamic
ileus is less likely.
.
[**4-3**] CT Chest, ABD, Pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1) No pulmonary embolism or evidence of bowel obstruction.
2) Moderate amount of ascites.
3) Cardiomegaly with evidence of mild congestive heart failure
and passive hepatic congestion. Small right pleural effusion.
4) Coronary artery calcification.
5) Mild enlargement of the pulmonary arteries, suggestive of
pulmonary arterial hypertension.
6) At least one small cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas,
which appears likely to connect to the main pancreatic duct but
is not well evaluated on CT; this could be followed up in 6
months.
7) Adrenal lesions not well characterized on this study appear
consistent with adenomas on prior studies.
.
[**4-4**] RUQ U/S:
1. Liver Doppler findings consistent with right heart
failure/triscuspid regurgitation. Patent hepatic vasculature.
2. Hepatomegaly. No evidence of splenomegaly.
3. Limited evaluation of the gallbladder which may contain
stones.
.
[**4-4**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular ejection
fraction appears somewhat reduced. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen
on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.
IMPRESSION: No left atrial or left atrial appendage clot, but
severe left atrial appendage spontaneous echo contrast
.
[**4-7**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Improvement in the congestive heart failure seen on
the prior examination.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 73 yo F with DM II, HTN, ESRD on HD, who presented
with shortness of breath, found to have new onset atrial
fibrillation, cardiac ascites, course complicated by persistent
bleeding in the setting of attempted [**Numeric Identifier **] in
preparation for cardioversion, requiring transfer to the MICU.
.
On the floor patient underwent an abdominal CT scan which showed
moderate ascites as well as hepatomegaly. She also underwent
abdominal ultrasound as well as paracentesis with 800cc of fluid
removed, and ultimately it was thought that her ascites was c/w
cardiac ascites. Hepatology was consulted and agreed. Hepatitis
serologies have been negative.
.
She also had new onset atrial fibrillation, and patient was
started on a heparin gtt with the plan for TEE and subsequent
cardioversion. However, after TEE was performed, she had not yet
been dialyze
