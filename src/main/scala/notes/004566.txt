Admission Date:  [**2107-10-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2107-11-2**]


Service:  Medicine

ADDENDUM:  1.  Pulmonary/respiratory:  The patient was
admitted to the floor and completed a course of vancomycin
for pneumonia with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus positive swabs in her nares.  On discharge, she was
saturating 95% to 98% in room air.  She is tachypneic at
baseline due to her kyphotic lung restriction.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was periodically
tachycardiac on the floor, which was fluid responsive.  She
was not tachycardia in the final days of her admission.  She
was hypertensive at times during her admission and her
atenolol was increased to 25 mg with good blood pressure
control.

3.  Neurologic:  The patient was status post generalized
tonic-clonic seizure.  The plan was to have her on Dilantin
until [**2107-11-7**] at 150 mg daily, although she was
subtherapeutic on this dose and, on the day prior to
discharge, the dose was upped to 200 mg daily.  The patient
will need a free Dilantin level taken tomorrow since her
albumin is low.

4.  Infectious disease:  The patient has completed a ten day
course of vancomycin for pneumonia with Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus in sputum culture.

5.  Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit was stable when she
left the floor.

6.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient
initially failed her swallow evaluation after her extubation.
Upon re-evaluation, the patient was found to aspirate thin
but to be safe for thickened liquids.  The patient should get
thickened pureed foods and should get a one-to-one sitter,
but she was taking orals at the time of discharge.

7.  Tubes, lines and drains:  The patient had a left midline
placed which was discontinued two days prior to discharge
since she had erythema in the area and her right peripheral
was taken.

8.  Prophylaxis:  The patient was continued on subcutaneous
heparin and proton pump inhibitor.

9.  Code status:  The patient remained "Do Not Resuscitate",
"Do Not Intubate".
