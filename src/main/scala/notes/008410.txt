Hyperlipidemia, and Hep C who presents to the ED this morning
with speech difficulty and right facial weakness.  The patient
herself is unable to provide a history at this time.  According
to family, the patient woke up this morning around 5:30AM.  She
was last seen well yesterday evening.  upon awakening this
morning, she apparently tried to call another relative to report
that something was wrong.  During that phone call, however, her
speech was unintelligible.  The family went to the house to
check
on her and found her ambulating with non fluent, nonsensical
speech.  She followed occasional commands, but appeared
"confused".  Her daughter noted a right facial droop.  EMS was
called and she was brought to the ED.  Neurology consult was
called at 8:30 AM and I was present at the bedside within at
8:35AM.

According to the family, she has had occasional diarrhea over
the
last week.  Otherwise, she has been healthy.  She had her
regularly scheduled dialysis yesterday. She was recently
admitted

have
a viral infection, all cultures were negative.

LDLcalc-266* LDLmeas-241*
[**2157-4-7**] 09:35AM BLOOD %HbA1c-5.7 [Hgb]-DONE [A1c]-DONE

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the neurology ICU given her
hypotension and position-dependent exam, with fluctuating
right-sided weakness. She stabilized her pressures on pressor
support for the first few days and was then transferred to the
floor on HD #3 off pressors. At this point, her global aphasia
had resolved to a fluent aphasia and her right side had
recovered its strength.

Her vascular risk factors include hyperlipidemia, for which she
will continue on lipitor and zetia. HbA1c was 5.7. TTE was
unremarkable for cardioembolic source. MRA neck showed no
stenoses.

The patient was started on aggrenox, as she had a drug-eluding
stent in [**2154-6-4**] and no history of angina. Cardiology agreed
with this plan and discontinuation of plavix.

She was followed by renal for hemodialysis and suffered no
complications.

She will be seen in stroke clinic for follow-up.

Her NG tube should be continued until she is fully able to eat
enough to meet her nutritional needs. On video swallow, she had
no esophageal difficulty but was slow to swallow. For this
reason, the NG tube was continued, even as her diet was advanced
to nectar/puree, until she is able to eat enough on her own.
