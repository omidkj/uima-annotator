Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2758**]
Chief Complaint:
MRSA pneumonia, bacteremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation x2
Tracheostomy placement
G-tube placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 77yo M with PMH significant for a left pontine CVA
with residual right-sided hemiperesis, prior subarachnoid
hemorrhage, severe HTN, HL, CKD (baseline Cr 2.0) and asthma who
was originally admitted to OSH with 3 weeks of progressive SOB
and was found to have extensive left-sided MRSA pneumonia and
bacteremia. Of note, pt was recently in Phillipenes, returned to
the U.S. on [**1-1**].  Pt was initially treated with Zosyn, CTX,
Azithro and streoids.  He subsequently deteriorated requiring
admission to the ICU, intubation and addition of Vanc for MRSA
coverage.  Cultures eventually grew MRSA in sputum and blood and
CXR contineud to show progressive consolidation of the left lung
and his fevers persisted.  Pt was changed to Linezolid due to
concern for toxin-producing community-acquired MRSA with
necrotizing pna and CT scan showed consolidaiton throughout left
lung and left sided pleural effusion as well as narrowing in the
left main stem bronchus.  He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**1-8**]
which showed blood clot which completely occluded takeoff to LUL
and extended into left main stem and it could not be suctioned
off via flexible bronchoscopy.  Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for rigid bronchoscopy.  ID team recommended switching back to
Vancomycin given the bacteremia.  Current vent settings on
transfer were AC 40% TV 400 RR 12 PEEP 5. VS were 160s-180s
70-80s CVP 8-10 Tmax 103.6.
.
Of note, pt's course was complicated by AF with RVR on evening
of [**1-8**] requiring Diltiazem drip. He has reportedly now been rate
controlled and in NSR since 0600 on [**1-9**]. At baseline, PERRL,
does not follow commands, nonenglish speaking. UOP has been
45-100cc/hr. Hospital course also complicated by episode of
twitching on [**1-8**] with abnormal tongue movements. Head CT was
performed and was negative.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, pt is sedated, unresponsive.  Appears
comfortable.

[**1-10**] Cytology: DIAGNOSIS: Left Pleural Fluid:
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

[**1-10**] CXR:
The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. The left internal
jugular line tip is at the level of junction of the left
brachiocephalic vein and SVC. The NG tube tip is in the stomach.

There is large left upper lung consolidation with minimal air
bronchogram that might represent the known necrotizing pneumonia
mentioned in the requisition.  There is also left lower lobe
consolidation that most likely represents a combination of
pleural effusion and consolidation. Right lung is essentially
clear, but there is questionable opacity in the right lower
lobe, faint, that might represent developing infectious process.
