Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**]
Chief Complaint:
Urosepsis and hypotension.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation [**2144-11-13**] to [**2144-11-16**].

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 41-year-old right-handed man, with a history
of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe
lower extremity weakness and urinary retention, s/p Foley
catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, chronic pain, who
presented to the emergency room at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2144-11-12**] with
increased weakness. The patients sister reports that he had been
having fecal incontinence and diarrhea over the last week, and
then developed SOB and acute onset abdominal pain the day of
admission. There were no fevers or CP, but were some chills. But
he was on high-dose dexamethasone.

ED COURSE: He was noted to be somnolent and hypotensive. He was
intubated for airway protection. CVL was placed and started on
neosynephrine and Levophed drips. Given 8L NS fluids and broad
spectrum antibiotics with vanco/zosyn. Labs were notable for
elevated lactate 7.1 and acute renal failure (creatinine 1.8).
Scans of head and torso with evidence of possible pneumonia
(aspiration) but no other source. Urinalysis was grossly
positive. Cardiology and surgery were consulted for questionable
cardiogenic shock and acute abdomen, respectively. He was then
admitted to the MICU.

MICU COURSE: He was weaned off vasopressors with repeated fluid
boluses. Levoflox and Flagyl added to vancomycin and Zosyn. C.
difficile and legionella urine Ag were negative. Urine and blood
cultures from the ED eventually grew E. coli sensitive to
cephalosporins and antibiotics were tailored to cefazolin and
flagyl. He was extubated on [**2144-11-15**]. But he developed CHF with
echocardiogram suggestive of Takotsubos. He was auto-diuresed
and started on ACE inhibitor per Cardiology; no beta-blocker
given chronically bradycardic (HR 40-50s, asymptomatic).
Troponin peaked at 0.3 with flat CKs. Anticoagulation was
discussed given apical akinesis but deferred due to risk of
bleeding with underlying malignancy. His dexamethasone were
continued at Q12H. But he developed thrombocytopenia and heparin
products stopped but HIT negative so restarted and platelet
counrs have subsequently improved. He had been holding chronic
pain medications given recent intubation. He was transferred to
OMED for further care.

Currently the patient complains of mild abdominal pain and loose
stools. Denies SOB but notes low O2 sats occasionally. No other
pain including no chest pain. Denies nausea or vomiting. He
feels below baseline strength overall and fatigued.

off.
This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2
weeks rest and repeat cycle [**11-6**]= C1D22 CPT-11/Avastin (D15 was
held).
