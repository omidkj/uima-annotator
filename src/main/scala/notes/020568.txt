Pertinent Results:
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage.
A patent foramen ovale is present with left to right flow under
anesthesia
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve is
bicuspid. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**Known firstname **]
[**Known lastname **] before surgical incision.

POST-BYPASS:
Preserved biventricualr systolic function.
Intact thoracic aorta and the tube graft in the ascening aorta
is visualized well with a good contour and no leaks
Aortic bioprosthetic valve is well seated and functioning well
with a residual peak gradient of 28mm of Hg peak and 15mm of Hg
mean.
