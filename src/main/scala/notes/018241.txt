Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypertension

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 88-year-old white male with
history of congestive heart failure, multiple sclerosis and
neurogenic bladder with an indwelling Foley catheter
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with fever and
hypertension.  The patient was initially transferred from the
nursing home to the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency
Department because the patient's chronic indwelling Foley
catheter had come out.  After unsuccessful attempts to
replace the Foley by the Emergency Department staff, as well
as the urology service.  A cystoscopy was performed by
urology.  This revealed multiple urethral strictures.
Following this, a suprapubic tube was placed by urology.  The
patient was initially planned to go back to the nursing home,
but then decompensated spiking a fever to 101.8?????? with a heart
rate of 110 along with a blood pressure of 70/palpation.  The
patient was initially given intravenous fluid boluses and
then begun on a dopamine drip.  He was given doses of
ceftriaxone and Levaquin.  Upon arrival to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, the patient reported mild abdominal
pain, but denied shortness of breath. There was a report of
greenish sputum produced in the Emergency Department.
However, the patient denied chest pain or trouble breathing.

ADMITTING LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 9.0,

bicarbonate 27, BUN 29, creatinine 0.9, glucose 106, INR 1.2,

RADIOLOGIC:  Electrocardiogram - sinus tachycardia at 124
with left axis deviation, left anterior fascicular block.  Qs
in 3, F, V5 and V6 without acute change compared to [**Month (only) **] of
'[**91**]. Chest x-ray with a right lower lobe opacification,
increased bilateral interstitial markings with mild hilar
engorgement.  Chest CT with bibasilar opacifications, right
greater than left, atelectasis versus aspiration versus
pneumonia, distal aortic aneurysm.  Abdomen and pelvis CT
distal nonobstructive IVC thrombus without evidence of free
air or fluid.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Cardiovascular/Hemodynamic:  The patient was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a presumed diagnosis of
sepsis from a likely urinary tract infection and potentially
a pneumonia.  Upon arrival to the Intensive Care Unit in the
Emergency Department, the patient's blood pressure remained
quite labile often cycling from a systolic of 80 to 130 over
the course of several minutes.  During these cycling
episodes, even with low blood pressure, the patient remained
tachycardic with no change in his mental status or
oxygenation.  It was concluded that his highly labile blood
pressures could very likely be secondary to underlying
autonomic dysfunction given his multiple sclerosis with
urinary and gastrointestinal involvement.  As a result, the
patient's pressors were weaned off very quickly and required
minimal fluid boluses for blood pressure control.  During
this admission, the patient appeared to tolerate a systolic
blood pressure in the 80s without tachycardia or symptoms.
During this admission, his Lasix and his Vasotec was held.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient remained on minimal supplemental
oxygenation without desaturation.

3.  Infectious disease:  The patient defervesced over the
course of his admission.  His urinalysis revealed a urinary
tract infection and is felt to be the most likely source of
his bacteremia, given his genitourinary manipulation and
pneumonia was also diagnosed on chest x-ray.  At the time of
this dictation, all cultures remained negative.  The patient
was changed to Levaquin po for coverage of his community
acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection.  Because of
potential for bacterial seeding of his genitourinary tract,
he was recommended to complete a 14 day course.

4.  Hematologic:  A distal IVC thrombus was noted in the
patient as an incidental finding on his abdominal CT.  This
was felt by the radiology interpretation to be chronic rather
than acute.  Given the patient's multiple comorbidities an
desire for minimal amounts of treatments and potentially
invasive procedures, Coumadin or any kind of anticoagulation
will be deferred at this time.

5.  Neurological:  The patient was continued on his
Neurontin, Sinemet and Dilantin.

6.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient
tolerated a soft pureed diet with thickened liquids and was
to remain on aspiration precautions.

7.  Genitourinary:  The patient's suprapubic tubes remained
in place.  As per the urology service, this will remain in
place for six weeks until he will follow up in urology clinic
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8872**], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 24252**].

8.  Disposition/Code status:  After extensive discussions
were held with the patient's doctor, Mrs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
and her husband, along with the patient's primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 24253**], the patient's code status was
confirmed as DNR/DNI.  Because of his age, multiple
comorbidities, very frequent hospital admissions and the
desire to minimize any and all invasive and/or stressful
procedure, the decision was made that should the patient be
hospitalized again he specifically request that he not be
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and not have any
central lines placed.
