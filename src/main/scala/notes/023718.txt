Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 73M with h/o NSCLC s/p pneumonectomy, CHF (LVEF 25-30%),
COPD, presents with STEMI likely [**2-28**] apical ballooning syndrome
and respiratory failure.

1) Respiratory failure: Pt initially p/w Likely aspiration/PNA
superimposed on underlying pulmonary disease (s/p right
pneumectomy, COPD). Following pt's catheterization on [**7-24**], pt
was intubated and transferred to CCU. Pt  was extubated on the
same day. Pt was re-intubated on [**7-25**] when became hypoxic (o2
40%). Pt self extubated [**7-26**] after which he became he had apnic
episodes lasting up to one minute, for which he was
re-intubated. Pt received several dose of diamox given concern
for decreased respiratory drive [**2-28**] metabolic alkalosis. Pt
continued to fail pressure support trials [**2-28**] apnea so trach
placed on [**8-6**]. Pt again failed PS trial on day prior to
discharge as pt became tachy with high rr (40s) on PS of 18.
Pt's present vent settings now AC Vt 350 rr 22 Fi02 0.25 PEEP 5.

2) STEMI: On [**7-23**] pt had elevated TPN level and EKG with STE
V1-V4 with TWI. On [**7-24**] pt had acute chest pain and received
cardiac catheterization which revealed only mild disease except
known disease to RCA with good collaterals and apical
ballooning. Elevated troponin levels attributed to apical
ballooning vs. coronary vasopspasm. Pt transferred to the CCU
[**2-28**] to intubation. In MICU pt has been continued on ASA. ACE and
BB held for septic shock. Pt now back on ACE-I. TO be placed on
BB post-d/c.

3) Septic shock: On [**7-31**] pt spiked a fever C. diff (+) with MRSA
in urine/sputum. PT's SBPs dropped to 70s with leukocytosis. Pt
given large volumes of fluid and placed on a titrated dose of
levophed. Pt placed on vanco for MRSA and flagyl for positive C.
diff toxin. Pt's volume status by MAPs and CVPs resolved. Pt off
levophed since [**8-4**], afebrile, with resolving leukocytosis on
vanco/flagyl.

4) Neuromuscular weakness: Due to pt's apneic episodes, there
was a concern for apneic episodes/bulbar weakness during prior
extubation. No current apneic episodes
Given LE weakness and ?LUE weakness, neuro suggested L&T spine
CT and repeat head CT which were done on [**8-5**] and were negative.
An EMG performed on [**7-26**] was c/w general axonal
sensorimotorpolyneruopathy, ?superimposed proximal myopathy; not
c/w NMJ disorder (LEMS or MG), though the study was limited.
(-)MG Ab; LE panel negative; anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] pending.
.
5) CHF, EF 30%: Diuresis was held due to septic shock/
hypotension. Pt is presently 24L positive. Pt restarted on lasix
10-20 mg qd on [**8-5**] once his pressors were d/c'd. Pt restarted
ACE-I on [**8-7**] and has been titrated up to present dose.

6) Right scapular wound: Pt has had chronic wound since
pneumonectomy. Pt was continued on [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes.

7) F/E/N: Pt on tube feeds by OG throughout majority of hospital
course. PEG placed without complications on [**8-7**] by GI.

8) PPx: Pt on PPI and subQ heparin throughout hospital course.

9) Comm: son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 19647**] (cell phone). Wishes to be
called w/ all changes.
