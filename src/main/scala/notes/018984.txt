.
[**2184-12-8**] CXR: No pneumothorax. Stable cardiomegaly, right
pleural effusion and background pulmonary parenchymal changes of
sarcoidosis.
.
[**2184-12-8**] LENIs: No evidence of DVT.
.
[**2184-12-9**] CT Chest: 1. No evidence of mediastinal hematoma.
2. Small, likely partially loculated right pleural effusion,
without evidence of hemorrhagic component.
3. Focal superior segment right lower lobe opacity, which may be
due to
atelectasis, aspiration, or early infectious pneumonia.
4. Slight increase in right pericardial lymph nodes with
otherwise unchanged lymphadenopathy. Widespread pulmonary
changes of sarcoidosis are unchanged.

[**2184-12-9**] CT Abd/Pelv:

Brief Hospital Course:
# Anemia - Pt's baseline HCt appears to be 26-30. Arrived at ED
with Hct of 16.3. Likely secondary to bleeding, could be a slow
GIB given h.o angioectasias and guaiac +stool. CT CHEST/Abd/Pelv
ruled out intrathoracic/abdominal bleeding and confimend HD
tunnel line in place.  GI deferred scope as this was likely a
slow bleed.  She received HD x2 with 3 L take off each time and
total of 3 U PRBC given.  Addtionally DDAVP was given for uremic
platlets.  Her Hct bumped appropriately.
.
# Fever/chills - Likely related to infection. Patient complained
of mild dry cough prior to admission.  CT chest with ? early
pna.  Abx were peeled off, but it was decided that she should
complete a course of Levofloxacin for ? PNA vs Bronchitis.
.
#SOB - was a first thought be a combination of PNA, fluid
overload and sarcoid flare. Treated with Levofloxacin for PNA,
HD for pulm edema. Pulm was consuted.  Her shortness of breath
was thought to be secondary to pulmonary hypertension of unclear
etiology.  She had had a VQ scan earlier this year which was
negative for PE and thus pulmonary thought that it was less
likely to be secondary to this.  Her oxygen level decreased to
82% on RA after walking the entire loop of the nursing station.
Her oxygen level was titrated and she required 6L with
amublation to maintain an oxygen saturation of 92%.  She was
started on sildenafil 25 mg tid after HD which she tolerated
well. On discharge home she was switched to revatio with strict
instructions to monitor her blood pressure prior to taking it
and to hold this medication prior to dialysis. She has selected
to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of pulmonary.
.
#ESRD - Pt formerly on PD and HD started the second day of
admission.  She underwent HD daily to attain euvolemia.  Towards
the end the patient weight 127 lbs which she claimed was close
to her dry weight of 126 lbs. She was continued on sevelemer and
a renal diet.
.
# RUE/Breast swelling: was though to be from obstruction of SVC
[**2-28**] to RIJ HD catheter placement. Her breast swelling improved
slightly with daily HD but it was still present at discharge. A
right upper extremity US was negative for DVT.  She knows that
she must discuss this with her NP[**MD Number(3) 18184**] appointment on [**12-27**] to faciliate further evaluation such as a mammogram and an
ultrasound.  Of note we avoided additional studies involving
contrast as the patient has some renal function left which is
critical for her to be able to eventually return to peritoneal
dialysis.
.
# Medication reconciliation: Upon performing medication
reconciliation prior to d/c it was observed that her ursodiol
had been held. Careful review of the chart was unrevealing apart
from a transaminits but per micromedix ursodiol does not cause
increased liver function tests. I discussed this in detail with
her and she will discuss this with her NP and gastroenterologist
on [**12-27**] and [**12-28**].
.
#HTN - initially held antihypertensives and restarted them as
needed.
.
# Epilepsy - Continued home lamictal, lorazepam prn.
.
# FEN: renal diet.
.
# Access-2 PIVs, HD catheter
.
# PPx:PPI, bowel reg, spirometry, venodynes, NO HEPARIN
.
# Code:full discussed and confirmed with patient.
.
Dispo: Discharged home at her request with services: HHA, PT,
[**Name (NI) 269**].
