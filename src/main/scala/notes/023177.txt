Carotid Artery Stenosis

PROCEDURE: Left carotid endarterectomy with bovine pericardial
patch angioplasty

PROCEDURE:  Evacuation of left neck hematoma.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an elderly female who was found
to have a 90% carotid stenosis. Given her advanced age, she
recovered nicely from colectomy and was very concerned about
stroke. She understood the risks of the procedure, including
stroke, cranial nerve injury and bleeding. After long
discussions with her and her  family, she decided that she
would prefer an endarterectomy as opposed to watchful waiting
where she was already on full medical management

Past Medical History:
-  Carotid artery stenosis: 80-99% on L, 40-59% on R by doppler
(4/[**2108**]). Bruit found incidentally on exam (asymptomatic at that
time); twice was supposed to have repair, but delayed [**1-28**]
anemia.
-  Coronary artery disease w/ h/o silent anterior MI in
[**2094**]: Echo [**2094**], estimated LVEF>55%, LV hypertrophy,
anteroseptal hypokinesis, mild-moderate MR. [**First Name (Titles) 25209**] [**Last Name (Titles) 101551**]
scan [**2094**]: Severe defect over the anterior and apical walls,
which partially improves to a moderate defect on resting images.

-  Hypertension: pt uncertain of baseline BP
-  Colon cancer: diagnosed by colonoscopy [**2109-7-1**]: A ulcerated 2
cm mass of malignant appearance was found in the proximal
ascending colon.
-  Gastric ulcers: diangosed by endoscopy [**2109-7-1**]
-  Anemia: believed to be [**1-28**] GI bleed from cancer, ulcer
-  IVC filter: patient unsure of why it was placed
-  Right humerus and pelvic fracture: motor vehicle accident. R
arm hardware.
-  Asthma: hospitalized 8-9 years ago O/N, was not intubated

Social History:
Never smoked. Does not drink alcohol.
Retired. Ambulates without assistive devices. No falls. Lives
alone. Son who used to live with her, passed away last year at
age 62 with heart attack. Daughter (health care proxy, [**Name (NI) **]
