Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 60 year-old woman transferred from OSH
after perforated sigmoid diverticuli s/p partial sigmoid
resection, right-sided weakness, colostomy, sepsis, respiratory
failure, pneumonia and ARDS, quite notable on CXR. Due to her
respiratory status, she received a percutaneous tracheostomy
tube on [**12-18**]. She also underwent an exploratory laparotomy with
revision of her ostomy site, at which time by report she
underwent a 5cm bowel resection; the final operative report was
not available at time of this writing. She continued on TPN,
however, as she was felt to be unable to swallow, and in need of
aggressive nutrition. An MRI on [**12-20**] confirmed the clinical
diagnosis of left MCA stroke, eliciting her right-sided
weakness. She continued aggressive antibiotic and antifungal
therapy at the recommendation of the infectious disease service.
As she experienced return of bowel function, she was
transitioned from TPN to tubefeeds, and was at goal tubefeeds by
[**12-24**]. A further cardiology workup revealed  a mitral
endocarditis, for which she was treated with aggressive
antibiotic therapy by the cardiology team. Her ARDS was slow to
improve, and was closely followed with chest x-rays and clinical
monitoring. Pt continued a slow but steady improvement.

It was only by [**1-12**] that any significant radiologic improvement
was noted in her ARDS, although she seemed to be tolerating the
tracheosotomy well, with good saturations. A follow up CXR on
[**1-17**], however, still showed large infiltrates bilaterally. In
order to maximize her nutritional status, a percutaneous
gastrostomy tube was placed on [**2127-1-15**]. As her post-operative
fever and wbc cell count remained elevated, a tagged wbc scan
was undertaken, which showed no focal aggregations of white
blood cells. ALthough of unclear origin, her difficulty
swallowing remained. She did not tolerate a Passy-Muir valve;
she had quite thick secretions and was noted to be in some
distress with the valve. She is quite comfortable on the trach
collar. Her white blood cell count stabilized, and she remained
afebrile for over a week. By [**1-22**], the nature of her care
requirements was more suitable for an acute care rehabilitation
facility (she will require extensive rehabiliation, and a
skilled nursing facility would be inappropriate), and was
transferred to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital in good
condition.
