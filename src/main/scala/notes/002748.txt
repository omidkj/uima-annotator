aneurysm with [**Doctor Last Name **] tag stent.  He tolerated the procedure well,
was extubated and taken to the PACU for recovery.  He remained
hemodynamically stale, and his systolic BPs were kept a bit on
the higher side, 120-160, for spinal perfusion.  He maintained
good neuro-vascular function of the lower extremities throughout
his stay. He was later transfered to the CV ICU where he was
montiored closely. He remaiend hemodynamically stable with good
BPs and neuro-motor function. He tolerated a regular diet and
once his spinal drain was removed, he ambulated and voided
without difficulty.  His pain remained under good control
throughout his stay.  Given his need for slightly elevated BPs,
his lisinopril was not restarted post operatively.  On POD 3 he
was doing quite well and was deemed stable for discharge to
home.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as well as his
