Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
Bronchial stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible bronchoscopy, rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal and
balloon dilation of the bronchus intermedius, endobronchial
biopsy of the bronchus intermedius.


History of Present Illness:
Ms.[**Known lastname 32872**] is an 80 year-old woman with lung cancer who has
undergone right upper lobectomy and radiation therapy 17 years
ago. She presented in [**2185-3-25**] with progressive dyspnea and
productive cough.  She was ultimately found to have stenosis of
the bronchus intermedius and underwent placement of a metal
stent
[**2185-8-18**].  She continues to complain of cough, mainly over the
past 3 days; she reports sputum productive of brownish sputum.
She notes her baseline level of dyspnea, which she tells me is
10
-15 feet on level ground.  She denies fever, chills, or night
sweats.  She presents today for bronchoscopy and stent
evaluation.


Past Medical History:
COPD, GERD,  CAD with stent placement, breast cancer, s/p l
Mastectomy; colon cancer, s/p colectomy; History of syncopes and
collapse (not in the last 1.5 years), LLE DVT one year ago

Pertinent Results:
[**8-29**]: CT Chest
FINDINGS: The new stent in the bronchus intermedius is fully
expanded and
contains eccentric intraluminal soft tissue in its distal
course. There is
residual narrowing just proximal to the tip of the stent in the
right main
stem bronchus(3.20). The right middle and lower lobe bronchi are
patent.
Evaluation of the upper mediastinum is limited due to extensive
streak
artifact from multiple surgical clips however there is no
evidence of disease recurrence at the resection site post- right
upper lobectomy. The
infectious/inflammatory component of the right upper lung
consolidation has resolved with residual post-radiotherapy
related consolidation in the right apex, unchanged. The small
right pleural effusion has slightly increased in size, and
marked peribronchial wall thickening in subsegmental and
subsegmental bronchi of the right lower lobe persists with
centrilobular nodularity throughout the right lung, suggesting
superimposed infection or inflammation. There is increased
peribronchial thickening which is severe surrounding the
segmental course of a right lower lobe bronchus (3.23) which is
most likely due to inflammation or infection, attention to this
area should be made on followup to exclude disease recurrence.
This is best seen on the coronal sequences (400B.36).
Atelectasis in the periphery of the right lower lobe (3.37) is
new and mild. No new pathological enlargement of mediastinal or
axillary lymph nodes by CT size criteria. Centrilobular
emphysema in the left upper lobe is mild and unchanged. Discrete
sub 2 mm nodules in the left lower lobe (4.150 and 4.176) are
stable. Calcification of the aorta is unchanged, the heart size
is normal with no pericardial effusion. Pulmonary arteries are
normal, calcification of the aortic valve is stable.

Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable except to
note atrophy of both kidneys and the pancreas.

No new destructive or sclerotic bone lesions, post-surgical
changes in the
right hemithorax are unchanged with extensive degenerative
changes throughout the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION:

1) New stent in the bronchus intermedius with residual proximal
stenosis in the right main stem bronchus. The distal stent
contains intraluminal
secretions/granulation tissue

2)New peribronchial wall thickening in a subsegmental bronchus
in the right lower lobe, the presence of enlarged small right
pleural effusion and multiple centrilobular nodules suggest
superimposed infection or inflammation.

3)Stable sub-2-mm left lower lobe nodules.

4)Status post right upper lobectomy with post-surgical changes
including
radiation fibrosis in the right apex is stable.

5)Calcification of the coronary artery and aortic valve and
mitral valve is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
80F hx bronchial stenosis admitted evaluation.  Flex bronch and
chest CT revealed granulation tissue around metal stent placed
[**8-3**].  Stent was subsequently removed and the airway was
dilated. The patient's WBC [**Known firstname **] to 47.8 and she was started on
Linezolid and Zosyn emperically.  C. Diff was negative.  The
following day WBC count decreased to 16.1.  The elevated WBC
count may be attributed to a reaction to a colonized stent.
Following stent removal the patient did well, maintaining
original O2 requirements without SOB or complication. A R PICC
was placed for abx.

At time of discharge, patient's vitals are stable, she is
afebrile.  She is tolerating a regular diet, ambulating and
breathing without difficulty.
