Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p unwitnessed fall; transferred from [**Hospital1 1474**] for eval of
intracranial hemorrhage and non-ST elevation MI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- placement and removal of right internal jugular central venous
catheter
- placement and removal of right femoral central venous catheter
- placement of left femoral central venous catheter

[**2177-3-4**] IVC filter placement
[**2177-3-6**] Bronchoscopy, transbronchial biopsy, bronchoalveolar
lavage and brushing
[**2177-3-13**] Stereotactic CT guided brain biopsy
[**2177-3-14**] Ultrasound-guided liver biopsy

History of Present Illness:
68F with HTN, COPD, EtOH abuse, and question of lung CA
presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2177-3-1**], one day after having
fallen in the setting of EtOH use.
.
The fall occurred on [**2177-2-28**].  Pt cannot give much history
surrounding the fall but mentions that she was walking towards a
chair when she fell.  Pt denies chest pressure or chest pain,
shortness of breath, or palpitations.  Denies hitting her head.
The morning after the fall ([**2177-3-1**]) pt's daughter called pt,
noted that pt seemed confused, with slurred speech, and brought
pt to the ED at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.  In the ED at [**Name (NI) 1474**]
Hospital, pt complained of headache, mild right shoulder pain,
and blurry vision.  Her exam was significant for a left frontal
echymosis and some swelling around her left orbit.  Pt was alert
and oriented x 3, with no focal neurologic deficits.  Laboratory
studies were notable for WBC 12.3, Plt 644, Na 129, troponin
5.1, CK 3319.  A head CT revealed right parietal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.  In the [**Name (NI) **], pt
was febrile to 103 with BP 89/57.  Pt was noted to be
disoriented and inattentive.  Finger-to-nose was unstable, L>R.
Pt received Tylenol 1300mg, vancomycin 1g IVx1, levofloxacin
500mg IVx1, flagyl 500mg IVx1, norepinephrine, and
dexamethasone. Due to hypotension to 79/palp, code sepsis called
and pt was started on levophed. A subclavian line was placed but
needed to be pulled [**3-14**] location of tip of catheter.  A R fem
line was placed and subsequently was pulled out by pt; a L fem
line was placed for access.
.
Does not have any pain now, does not feel thirsty. Pt denies
recent fevers at home, denies dysuria, cough, abdominal pain, or
changes in bowel movements.



Past Medical History:
ETOH abuse
HTN
R lung mass, possibly malignant, with "spot" in liver - pt due
for Bx and staging
COPD
anxiety


Social History:
Lives alone, has someone help with vacuuming and washing the
floors. Used to smoke about 1/2ppd x most of her life - > 45
years, quit 3-4 years ago. States that she drinks 3-4 beers/day
but family members have suggested more. Pt denies having had
shakes [**3-14**] withdrawal or having h/o seizures.

Pertinent Results:
CT head: hemorrhagic foci in L cerebellum and R frontal lobes
with surrounding vasogenic edema, concerning for metastatic foci

.
CT C spine: no acute fracture
.
Micro:
BlCx x 2 negative
.
EKG: 115bpm, NSR, nl axis, no ST/T wave changes
.
Bronchial Washings, [**2177-3-6**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Pulmonary macrophages and rare bronchial cells.
.
CXR, [**2177-3-6**]: No evidence of pneumothorax status post
transbronchial biopsy. 2.  Hazy increased opacity throughout the
right upper lobe could be suggestive of a postobstructive
process, likely secondary to right hilar adenopathy, better
appreciated on recent CT. 3.  Rounded nodular opacity in the
medial right upper lobe correlates with mass seen on recent CT.
.
Echo [**2177-3-6**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are  normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of
the basal half of the inferior and posterior (inferolateral)
walls. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valveleaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. Suboptimal image quality -patient unable
to cooperate.  Impression: inferior posterior hypokinesis
.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis, [**2177-3-7**]: 1.  Right upper lung nodule
concerning for lung carcinoma until proven otherwise. 2.
Partially occlusive intraluminal filling defects inferiorly from
the right upper lobe nodule as well as separate left lower lobe
fourth order branch filling defect is better visualized on CTA
of [**2177-3-3**], but likely still present. 3.  5.4 x 4.0 x
5.0 cm heterogeneously enhancing liver mass as described.  The
appearance is more suggestive of a metastatic lesion than
primary hepatocellular carcinoma or benign lesion. 4.  Multiple
hypoattenuating lesions in both kidneys too small to
characterize.  5.  Stable bilateral small pleural effusions with
compressive atelectasis. 6.  Atrophic spleen with multiple
punctate calcifications indicating prior granulomatous disease.
7.  Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. 8.  IVC
filter.
.
[**2177-3-12**] Stereotactic brain biopsy, +6 mm (smear #15 only):
Reactive brain, numerous cells with small, pyknotic nucleus and
red cytoplasm, and single, microscopic, poorly-preserved
fragment of atypical cells, suggestive of metastatic carcinoma.

NOTE: The only tissue suggestive of metastatic carcinoma is a
single tiny cluster of poorly preserved cells in the final
smear. That tissue contains nuclei tightly clustered together
and partially molded around each other. The remaining tissue is
either air dried, necrotic and partially mineralized, or
contains blood with frequent nucleated red blood cells. The
latter cells are the predominant preserved cell in the deeper
biopsies. Nucleated red blood cells are abnormal and make the
diagnosis of carcinoma suspect, especially given to poor
preservation of the small cluster of suggestive cells. Given
that this patient has a small, calcified spleen, other diagnoses
aside from carcinoma should be considered (e.g. granulomatous
disease, extramedullary hematopoiesis, bone marrow emboli,
chronic infections). The current material alone should NOT be
the basis of treatment for metastatic carcinoma. Confirmation of
carcinoma elsewhere should be sought (e.g. reviewing outside
pathology, additional biopsies of suspect sites). A bone marrow
biopsy to determine the cause of the nucleated red cells may be
warranted.
.
[**2177-3-13**] Liver biopsy:  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent
with metastatic small cell carcinoma.
