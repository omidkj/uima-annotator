Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7539**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath for one day

s/p Inferior vena cava filter placement

History of Present Illness:
78 y.o. female with h/o CAD s/p CABG x 2 [**2146-12-8**], who presented
to OSH with SOB x 1 day and was found to have pulmonary embolus
along with RV failure and was started on heparin.
She originally presented to an OSH on [**12-4**] with a left
swollen leg secondary to trauma and was found to have a leaking
popliteal aneurysm.  In the midst of [**Month (only) 1106**] w/u she was noted
to have TWI inversions and elevated troponins and thus underwent
L popliteal stent placement and cath on [**12-6**]. See results
below.  She then underwent 2 V CABG on [**2146-12-8**]. She
was then discharged to rehab on [**12-14**] and was at rehab
when she developed 1 day of shortness of breath for which she
was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] and found to have a PE and
hypotension along with RV dilatation on echo. She was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

OSH Imaging:
LLE US: L popliteal stent with no flow
.
Chest x ray at OSH: COPD changes, Focal L basilar opacity c/w
atelectasis or infiltrate, Small bilateral pleural effusions
.
Spiral CT:Extensive pulmonary embolus of the right main
pulmonary artery extending into the right upper, right middle
and right lower lobe arteries and left uppoer lobe artery. Right
brachiocephalic. Small bilateral pleural effusions, atelectasis
and emphysema.
.
Echo report from OSH: R ventricular dilatation with nml LV size
and function

ART DUP EXT LO UNI;F/U PORT
Duplex evaluations are performed on the left lower extremity
arterial system. The proximal above knee popliteal artery is
patent. At the level of the knee, there is increased velocity of
541 cm per second, no flow was seen in the popliteal artery
below that. Distal to the stent, there is a significant
turbulent flow with diminished velocity in the popliteal artery.

Chest AP:
IMPRESSION:

Improving CHF, decreasing bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar
consolidation, probably representing atelectasis, however,
pneumonia cannot be totally excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 78 year old female with h/o CAD s/p 2V CABG who now presents
with massive pulmonary embolus accompanied by hypotension
requring dopamine.
.
1. Massive PE:
Hypotension:
The patient was started on levophed in order to maintain an MAP
of 60. Upon review of her old records from her previous
discharge we learned that her normal BP is 90/60 and upon
floating a Swan Ganz catheter her PCWP was 6. We thus realized
that her hypotension was most likely secondary to dehydration
and she was gently re-hydrating with IV fluids and weaned off
dopamine. She was not given lytics because of her recent
surgery. She was taken to the cath lab for embolectomy and found
to have adequate clot dissolution and no RV compromise. A
temporary optese IVC filter was then placed and she was started
on heparin. (The removal of this filter should be discussed at
her appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22423**].) Her hypoxemia continued to
improve on heparin until the day of discharge when she was
sating well on 2.5L of O2 and able to ambulate independently
without difficulty.
.
2. CAD:
s/p recent CABG [**11-19**] (Lima to LAD, reverse SVG from Lima to
OMCa). Upon admission her enyzymes were flat and thus we had no
evidence of acute ischemia. She was thus continued on aspirin
and plavix.
.
3. CHF: EF 30%, near-global akinesis, 1+MR, mild pulm HTN
We thought that she was grossly fluid overloaded but she was
intra-vascularly dry. She also became tachycardic which we
thought was secondary to her being dry and thus her lasix was
held and she was gently hydrated by encouraging po intake. In
light of her low EF we suggest that she start on low dose lasix
20 mg qd upon discharge from [**Hospital1 **].  We also
suggest a chemistry 7 be drawn within 1 week of her resumption
of lasix.
.
4. Heme-occult positive stools:
During her hospitalization she was found to have heme-positive
stool with a stable HCT and thus we recommend an outpatient GI
work up.

5. LLE aneurysym:
Arterial duplexes demonstrated that her L popliteal artery stent
was occ
