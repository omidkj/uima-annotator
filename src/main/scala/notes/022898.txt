Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2139-2-3**] Urgent coronary artery bypass grafting x5: Left internal
mammary artery graft to left anterior descending; reverse
saphenous vein graft to the marginal branch, ramus intermedius,
diagonal branch, and posterior descending artery.


History of Present Illness:
51 year old male with known coronary artery disease and
cardiomyopathy who has been treated medically since his last
myocardial infarction in [**2134**]. Recently he was admitted for
heart failure and a repeat cardiac catheterization revealed
severe, diffuse three vessel disease with a markedly decreased
EF. He was quite symptomatic of his disease with significant
dyspnea on exertion and daily exertional angina. Given the
progression of his symptoms and severity of his
coronary artery disease, he has been referred for surgical
revascularization.

Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: Evaluation for pleural effusion.

COMPARISON: [**2139-2-5**].

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the Swan-Ganz
catheter has
been removed. The clips and sternal wires after CABG are
unchanged.
Unchanged elevation of the left hemidiaphragm due to an
overinflated stomach.
The presence of a minimal left-sided pleural effusion cannot be
excluded. The
ventilation of the retrocardiac lung areas, has improved.
Minimal fissural
density on the left suggests a small amount of intrafissural
effusion.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Moderate-severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. No resting
LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (?#). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal
image quality - poor apical views. Suboptimal image quality -
bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes. Suboptimal image
quality - body habitus.
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate to severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %). The right
ventricle is not well seen. The aortic valve leaflets (?#)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal wit
