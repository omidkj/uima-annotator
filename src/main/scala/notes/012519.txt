Allergies:
Lipitor / Ativan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4588**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o male w/h/o dementia (A&Ox2 at baseline), chronic
AFib, CAD s/p single-vessel CABG in [**2093**], and pseudogout who is
sent in from his PCPs office w/ acute mental status changes in
the setting of worsening productive cough and hypoxia.  His two
daughters found him quite confused last night and this morning
in his independent apartment at [**Location (un) **].  When they went to
see him this afternoon he was in his pajamas, confused and
agitated beyond his baseline.

Over the past few days, they had noted that he had developed a
cough with a small amount of sputum production.

Of note he recently had an episode of pseudogout, which was
treated by his rheumatologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1839**], at the [**Hospital1 3372**] with colchicine.

In Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] office he was found to be hypoxic on presentation
(91% RA), with a productive cough, and diminished mental status
(A&Ox1).

In the ED initial vitals:  98, HR 97, BP 110/55, RR 16, O2Sat
91% RA and work-up was initiated with CXR, head CT, u/a,
chemistry and CBC.  EKG was interpretted as AFib, LAD, NI, no
s/o ischemia and unchanged from prior.  Labs were impressive for
an INR of 18.0 and hct drop from 43 in [**Month (only) **] to 25 today.  On
further history taking it was discovered that the patient's INR
hasn't been checked "in months."  Rectal exam revealed guaiac
positive melanotic stool in the vault.  He was ordered for 4
units of FFP, 2 units of blood and 10mg of IV vitamin K and GI
was consulted.  He only received 1 unit of FFP prior to
transfer.

A Head CT was checked and ICH was r/o'd.  Given his elevated
WBC, he was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

On the floor he is without complaint, though nauseated in rapid
AFIB.

EGD:
Impression: Erythema in the gastroesophageal junction
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: The findings do not account for the symptoms.
Consideration should be given to repeat colonoscopy. Will need
to discuss with patient and faimly.
Additional notes: The attending was present for the entire
procedure. FINAL DIAGNOSES are listed in the impression section
above. Estimated blood loss = zero. No specimens were taken for
pathology

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]M on coumadin for AFIB coming in with greatly supertherapeutic
INR, AMS, hypoxia, and GI bleeding with HCT drop.

Diagnoses:

# GIB:  He presented with a supratherapeutic INR of 18 and was
given 3 units of FFP with improvement in his INR to 1.6.
Spontaneous gastritis in the setting of the coagulopathy was the
most likely source. EGD was performed and he did not show any
signs of active bleeding or oozing.  Colonoscopy was performed
and showed diverticulosis and two polyps the largest of which
was removed. He received 2 units of PRBCs with an appropriate
bump in his hematocrit. His bumex, lisinopril, metoprolol,
aspirin, and warfarin were initially held. He was restarted on a
diet and tolerated food. An IV PPI was initially started and
then he was transitioned to PO. His metoprolol was restarted but
his bumex and lisinopril were held due to low  blood pressure.

# AMS:  Thought to be secondary to acute illness in the setting
of a GIB coupled with sundowning. Frequent orientation was
helpful, and small doses of antipsychotics.

# Hypoxia:  He had mild hypoxia in the setting of a white count
and dry cough. His chest x-ray was unremarkable, however he did
have unilateral crackles. He was treated for a CAP with
azithromycin initially but this treatment was stopped later in
his hospitalization.  Exact etiology was not determined.

# Coagulopathy:  This may be secondary to a drug-drug
interaction between his coumadin and colchicine.  More likely
this was [**3-13**] either patient error administering his own
medication or the fact that he gets his INR checked relatively
infrequently (monthly) He was aggressively corrected. His
colchicine was discontinued after discussion with his
rheumatologist.

# AFIB:  HIs metoprolol was initially held but he had several
episodes of AFib with RVR.  He was treated with 5 mg IV
Metoprolol with resolution of these episodes. His Metoprolol was
restarted and was titrated up to 25 mg TID. This was converted
to metoprolol succinate on discharge. His warfarin was planned
to be restarted the day after discharge. He was also planned to
take enoxaparin unitl his INR was therapeutic.

# CAD: Aspirin held during coagulopathy.

Transitional Issues:
Anticoagulation: Mr [**Known lastname 103486**] warfarin was held in the setting
of his GIB and elevated INR. His INR at discharge was 1.2. His
warfarin will need to be restarted and his dose will need to be
titrated up to his goal INR of [**3-14**]. While he is subtherapeutic
he should be treated with enoxaparin which should be renally
dosed. Aspirin held at discharge. Decision about re-starting
aspirin can be addressed as outpatient once HCT known to be
stable with therapeutic INR.

Follow-up: Patient needs a follow up appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**]
after discharge from the rehabilitation facility.
