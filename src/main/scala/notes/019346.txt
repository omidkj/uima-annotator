Micro:
[**2145-11-24**] Stool Studies: C. Diff Negative
.
Studies:
[**2145-11-22**] EKG: (ED) Atrial fibrillation with uncontrolled
ventricular response. Diffuse low voltage. No previous tracing
available for comparison.
[**2145-11-22**] EKG: (ICU) Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response and slowing of the rate as compared to the previous
tracing of [**2145-11-22**]. There is continued diffuse low voltage.
Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
CXR [**2145-11-22**]:
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
Bilateral pleural effusions are noted with associated bilateral
lower lobe atelectasis. Cannot exclude underlying pneumonia.
Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion is also noted. The
heart size is difficult to assess but appears mildly enlarged.
No pneumothorax is seen. Cephalization is present. The osseous
structures are intact.
IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with congestive heart failure
with bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis also
present.
.
CTA Chest [**2145-11-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Dense contrast opacification of the right heart with enlarged
atria
bilaterally, and contrast reflux into the IVC and hepatic veins
raises concern for right heart failure. Findings along with
pulmonary septal thickening is consistent with CHF.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive
atelectasis.
.
Transthoracic Echo [**2145-11-23**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2145-11-23**]:
Bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated, right more than
left, with the impression of increasing of right pleural
effusion as compared to prior study. More layering appearance of
the effusion due to supine position of the patient as compared
to upright on the prior examination could explain different
distribution of pleural fluid. Bibasilar atelectasis in
particular involving left lower lobe is demonstrated. New left
upper lung opacity is seen, and might represent area of
atelectasis but infectious process in this area cannot be
excluded and should be closely followed on the subsequent
studies.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
.
Transesophageal Echo [**2145-11-25**]:
Mild spontaneous echo contrast appreciated in the left atrium
without evidence of discrete thrombus in the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild to moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.
.
CXR [**2145-11-26**]:
Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate on the right and
small-to moderate on the left, slightly decreased as compared to
[**2145-11-22**]. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There
is currently no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar
atelectasis secondary to effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 83 year old woman with no past medical history
who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and cough
and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR and
pulmonary edema.  Hospital course by problem list:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: This patient was likely in atrial
fibrillation for a long time given her echo findings of dilated
left atrium and heart failure.  She has 3+ MR which is likely
the etiology of her afib.  TSH was normal and CTA did not show a
PE.  She had an elevated d-dimer on admission.  She was
initially admitted to the ICU due to her heart rate of 160.  She
was on a diltiazem drip overnight, then weaned off and put on
metoprolol 25mg PO TID.  She was then transferred to the medical
floor.  Her heart rate was poorly controlled on metoprolol, even
with a doses of Metoprolol 100mg PO TID.  She expressed wishe
