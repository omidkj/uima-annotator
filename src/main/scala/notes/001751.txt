Hydralazine / Opioid Analgesics / Compazine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Removal of hemodialysis catheter, replacement with tunnelled
catheter
Pulmonary Intubation
Placement of PICC line
Cardiac cathteterization: 3VD


History of Present Illness:
74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, HTN, SVC stenosis s/p
dilation presents from HD with acute dyspnea. She reports
malaise the past 5 days. In dialysis, she had a low-grade temp
of 99, and developed chills and respiratory distress with sats
80's on NRB at which time she was sent to ED for further
evaluation.
.
In the ED, VS: T 100.6, HR 117, BP 170/84, RR 38, Sat 90% on
NRB. She reported chest pain. She had evidence of new LBBB with
discordant ST elevations <5mm in V2-V4. CODE STEMI was called.
She received ASA 325mg, Plavix 600mg load, heparin bolus+gtt,
nitro gtt. She also received 1 gm Vanco for presumed line
sepsis. She was intubated with Etomidate and Rocuronium and
transferred to the cath lab for intervention.
.
In the cath lab, she was found to be right dominant with no
disease in left main. Serial 90% lesions in LAD with TO at mid
LAD. She has left-to-left collaterals. Minimal disease in circ.
RCA with 30% mid occlusion and 90% at origin of PDA. Lesion in
RCA could be crossed wire but not ballon due to tortous nature.
CT [**Doctor First Name **] was recommended. Post-cath, the LBBB was resolved and HR
was lower. LVEDP was elevated at 35. Patient was transferred to
the CCU for further monitoring.

BCx [**11-22**]: PANTOEA SPECIES. NGTD since then
Influenza neg
C Diff neg x 3

CXR [**11-29**]
No evidence for CHF or pneumonia. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis
and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

CT ABD [**11-27**]:
1. Slight thickening of the gastric antrum. This is very likely
due to
underdistension and much less likely due to antral gastritis.
2. No bowel obstruction. No evidence of fluid collection.
3. Colonic diverticula, most prominent in the sigmoid colon. No
evidence for diverticulitis.
4. Stable renal hypodensities since the prior study. These are
indeterminate by CT criteria and may be further evaluated with
renal ultrasound.
5. Rounded tissue density adjacent to the SMA as detailed. This
is unchanged from multiple prior studies and may represent an
adrenal nodule. Contrast enhanced study may aid.

ECHO [**11-22**]: The left atrium is normal in size. The interatrial
septum is aneurysmal. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the
distal inferior wall, distal septum and apex. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2189-10-26**], a mild regional left ventricular wall motion
abnormality is now seen c/w CAD, Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension is now present.

CATH [**11-22**]:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Diastolic dysfunction and elevated systemic blood pressure.
3. Unsuccessful attempts to rervascularize the RPDA and LAD.
4. Cardiac surgery was consulted for CABG.


Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with
NSTEMI and pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.

BACTEREMIA: Pt found to have Pantoea spp in multiple cultures on
[**11-22**]. As pt continued to be febrile with climbing WBC, his
hemodialysis line was removed and thought to be the culprit
infectious source as she developed rigors with removal. The line
was replaced after line holiday of 3 days. Upon removal of the
line, the cuff was retained. This was evaluated by the
transplant surgeons who determined that this was not concerning
and it would not act as a nidus of infection. Pt was treated
with meropenem for 2 week course (end [**12-7**]) from first negative
blood culture on [**11-23**], and midline was placed to continue the
course as an outpt. Given the persistent elevated WBC, pt was
screened for C Diff and although was negative x 3, was treated
empirically with PO flagyl while on Meropenem for the
bacteremia. At time of discharge WBC was trending down and pt
was afebrile.

PUMP: On presentation pt was hypoxic with SOB, and showed signs
of pulmonary edema on CXR, in the setting of demand ischemia.
Echo showed normal EF, interatrial aneusym and mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of
the distal inferior wall, distal septum and apex. Pt was
uptitrated on ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker prior to discharge.


HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: On presenation, pt was intubated,
but had marked improvement in respiratory status following
antibiotics and diuresis. Patient was extubated without
difficulties, and continued to sat well afterwards.

HYPERTENSION:  As an outpatient, Ms. [**Known lastname 108904**] was on several
medications for blood pressure control.  As an inpatient, her
blood pressure has been well controlled on Metoprolol and
Lisinopril with SBPs in 110-120s.  There is some concern that
Ms. [**Known lastname 108904**] may have not been adherent to her regimen at home.

CORONARIES: Pt was determined to have demand ischemia given
bacteremia. Initially she was thought to have an NSTEMI
(elevated troponin and new LBBB). Given cath with severe
