62 y/o male w/ Medical history of untreated Hep C, COPD, chronic

with chest pain and withdrawal. The patient has had multiple
admissions most recently 2 in [**Month (only) 216**]  [**2116**]. In [**3-/2116**] he had an
NSTEMI with stent placement. In [**6-/2116**] he had a stress MIBI with
a wall motion abnormality and small,  reversible, anterolateral
perfusion defect. In [**7-24**], he was r/o for MI with enzymes,
EKGs. Cardiac cath was not recommended.  Pt was to be optimized
on medications, but continues to drink to excess and not take
cardiac medications. He was also found to have depression and
alcohol withdrawal and was encouraged to go into therapy, but
declined last minute.  He was readmitted from [**Date range (1) 45402**] for
chest pain again where cath was deferred given his continued
drinking and non-compliance with medications.
.
The patient presented again to the ED on the day of admission
with chest pain and concern over his drinking.  He reports that
he lost his health insurance and so has not been able to take
his medications for the past 3-5 days (was taking half pills
prior to that).  This made him anxious so he started drinking
more than usual.  He reports usually drinking 1 quart of vodka
daily, with his last drink being yesterday.  He has chest pain
2-3x daily for which he usually sits down and rests, which
dissipates his pain.  The patient also had a fall a few days
prior from a sitting position where he fell forwards and hit his
nose on a table, denied LOC, loss of bowel/bladder function,
tongue biting.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  98.0 110 154/114 18 100% 15L nrb.
Labs showed bicarb of 12 with anion gap of 26, normal CBC,
lipase of 93, EtOH of 69, normal LFTs, and trop < 0.01.  He was
given 3L NS, plavix 75mg, metoprolol tartrate 100mg, and a total
of ativan 8mg IV for withdrawal.  Per ED report, did have
hallucinations.  On transfer vitals were 90 185/115 RR: 30 O2:
99%RA
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient states he is feeling better
than on admission.
