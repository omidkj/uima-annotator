Chief Complaint:
Crohn's Disease

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is 26-year-old gentleman with Crohn's ilietis who
presents to the ED complaining of nasuea, bloating, and
abdominal
pain in the setting of known distal terminal ileum phlegmon
being
treated with Cipro, Flagyl and Remicade, and being followed by
GI. Most recent CT scan from [**8-27**] showed about 30-35 cm of
terminal ileal involvement with some proximal dilation.  Since
antibiotics were introduced and since being placed on 10 mg/kg
he
had done better, but he was tapering off the antibiotics and
developed some upper respiratory tract symptoms and then
developed some abdominal symptoms, particularly bloating and
diarrhea. Saw GI on [**11-9**], who were concerned about
concommitent
viral infection in the setting of Crohns flair, and had
encouraged a referral to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] to discuss surgical
options as has been failing medical therapy.
   He presents today after feeling acutely worse by mid-day,
much
different from when he saw GI only one day ago.  He states his
nausea, bloating, and reflux symtoms were much worse, and he
'didnt feel right'.  He denies fevers or chills, vomiting, chest
pain, or trouble breathing.  Last BM at 7pm, loose diarrhea no
blood.  +flatus, but not since coming to ER.  He states his
abdominal pain is unchanged from baseline, complaining of the
same discomfort in his RLQ from his known phlegmon.

POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS..
.
CTA [**2186-12-1**]
1. Suboptimal bolus renders this study non-diagnostic for
pulmonary embolus. Within this limitation no central PE is
identified.
2. Right upper lobe patchy consolidation, possibly due to acute
aspiration
or infectious pneumonia.
2. Secretions and mucus plugging in the bronchus intermedius and
right lower lobe bronchi, with postobstructive atelectasis right
middle lobe and collapse of right lower lobe. Left lower lobe is
also collapsed.
3. Moderate ascites.
4. Pneumoperitoneum, probably related to recent surgery.
.
[**12-1**] CXR
No change since previous chest radiograph. Reference to the CT
pulmonary
angiogram of the same date is advised.
.
[**12-2**] CXR
Comparison is made to prior study from [**2186-12-1**].
There is a consolidation at the right base, which has worsened
since the
previous study. This may represent aspiration or developing
pneumonia. The
cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is normal. There are low lung
volumes.
There is some atelectasis at the left base. No pneumothoraces
are seen.
.
[**12-3**] CXR
The findings are slightly more plate like suggesting that this
is atelectasis.
There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac
silhouette and
mediastinum is normal. There are no pneumothoraces.
.
[**12-4**] CXR
In comparison with the study of [**12-3**], there is persistent
opacification at the right base. Although this could merely
reflect
atelectasis, the possibility of supervening pneumonia can
certainly not be
excluded.
.
[**12-5**] CXR
In comparison with study of [**12-4**], there is little overall
change
at the right base. Again, the findings may reflect atelectasis
and small
effusion, though the possibility of supervening pneumonia cannot
be excluded.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to general surgery post-operatively.
Please see the intra-operative report for full details.  His
urine output was consistently low with minimal response to IVF
boluses.  He had serial hematocrits which were trending down to
a nadir of 22.7 on POD1.  On the evening of POD1, he was taken
back to the OR for exploratory laparotomy.  Again please see the
intra-operative report for full details.
.
Overnight, POD 1 from his second surgery he then became
tachycardic to 140's, desat'ed to 80's on 4L NC, but recovered
until this morning. At around 11am, he once again became hypoxic
to mid 80's on NC requiring NRB, BP 130's/80's, febrile to
103.0. ABG 7.42/49/68 EKG showed sinsus tachycardia with TWI
laterally. CXR with ? volume overload, gave lasix 10 IV to which
he put out 2500cc. He received nebs w/o improvement and was not
wheezing on exam. It was noted by surgery nursing staff that his
family had been pressing his diluaded PCA for while he was
sleeping. He was drowsy but easily arousable and RR 16. He then
went for CTA, which was negative for PE but showed new
consolidation and lobar colapse. He was then transfered to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Of note, he is 14L positive over his LOS.
.
[**2186-12-3**]-
- [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team & IP agree that pt is getting better on his own and
will hold off on ; needs aggressive chest PT and ability to
clear secretions is limited by pain. CXR today much improved
from prior. Bronch is invasive and can worsen pts underlying
pulmn process (asp PNA post-operative)
- ct abx
- adv diet to clears->fulls as tolerated
- MRSA positive nasal swab, put on contact precautions
[**2186-12-4**]
-[**Name2 (NI) **]ced to regular diet, given Colase for bowel regimen
-Has been walking in the hallway
-Had a bowel movement with fresh blood, Hct 25.1 from 25.7, will
re-check in 6 hours.
-Switched to PO pain regimen
-Hct 23.6 at 2am. Surgery aware, no tachycardia, good UOP. No
further BMs. No transfusion for now, will re-check at 8am.
-Satting well on 4L NC
.

He returned to the floor and was continued on a regular diet and
oral medications. He was weaned from Oxygen. Staples were
removed and steri strips were placed. he will followup with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2-21**] weeks. All d/c paperwork was reviewed and
