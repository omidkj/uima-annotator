Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2163-2-14**] 1. Aortic valve replacement with a 21-mm St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4041**] tissue valve. 2. Coronary artery bypass grafting x4
with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending artery, and reverse saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery, and sequential reverse saphenous
vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery and the distal
circumflex artery.

History of Present Illness:
68 year old male with severe aortic stenosis was transferred
from [**Hospital6 5016**] for further management of severe
aortic stenosis and three vessel disease. He was admitted to
[**Hospital3 **] in [**12-23**] with symptoms of wheezing and shortness of
breath. Reportedly, he was found to have an STEMI and was in
acute sCHF - cath showed 3VD and TTE with EF 25%. He experienced
Vfib arrest while in the hospital - ICD was subsequently placed.
He was evaluated for possible AVR/CABG but was thought to be too
high risk due to calcified aorta. He was set-up with [**Hospital1 2025**] for
evaluation for percutaneous valve replacement but has not been
evaluated by them yet and states that they were not able to
accomodate him quickly enough. He was readmitted to [**Hospital3 **]
on [**2-6**] with recurrence of wheezing, shortness of breath, cough
- less severe than in [**Month (only) 404**] per him. He was diuresed there
with Lasix 40 mg IV BID with resolution of his symptoms and his
AceI was decreased. He feels back to his usual self now except
for cold symptoms. He is now being referred to cardiac surgery
for surgical evaluation for aortic valve replacement and
revascularization.

IMAGING
[**1-/2080**] PANOREX
No peri-apical lucency to suggest dental infection. Clear
maxillary sinuses.
.
[**1-/2080**] CXR
FINDINGS: No previous images. The heart is normal in size and
there is no substantial vascular congestion or acute focal
pneumonia or pleural effusion.
Single channel ICD line extends to the region of the apex of the
right ventricle.
.
[**1-/2080**] CT TORSO
CHEST CT: In the left upper lobe, there is a 6-mm pulmonary
nodule (2:15). An additional 4-mm nodule is seen in the right
lower lobe (2:28). More inferiorly in the right lower lobe,
there is a tiny calcified granuloma (2:39). There is minimal
bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.
There are no pleural effusions. The airways are patent to the
subsegmental levels bilaterally.
There is extensive calcification throughout the thoracic aorta,
denser in the ascending portion and along the arch. Marked
aortic valve calcifications are seen. There is severe
calcification of the coronary arteries. The visualized portion
of the thyroid gland is unremarkable. Small calcified left hilar
lymph nodes measure up to 7 mm (2:23), consistent with prior
granulomatous disease. There are no pathologically enlarged
mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph nodes. There is no
pericardial effusion. Note is made of a left-sided pacemaker
with a right ventricular lead.
ABDOMEN CT: Lack of intravenous contrast material limits
assessment of the abdominal organs. The liver is grossly
unremarkable. The patient is status post cholecystectomy. The
spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.
The stomach, small bowel, colon, and appendix are grossly
normal. There are extensive calcifications throughout the
abdominal aorta, including at the origins of the celiac axis,
SMA, renal arteries, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**].
Calcifications are also seen throughout the iliac arteries
bilaterally. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. There is
no free fluid or free air in the abdomen. No pathologically
enlarged abdominal lymph nodes are seen.
PELVIS CT: The bladder is unremarkable. The prostate gland is
markedly enlarged, indenting the bladder at its base. There is
no free fluid in the abdomen. No pathologically enlarged
abdominal lymph nodes are seen. In the right inguinal region, in
continuity with or just anterior to the right common Femoral
artery, there is a rim calcified 3.6 x 3.0 x 3.5 cm structure,
incompletely characterized on this non-contrast study, but
possibly an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm of the right common
femoral artery or old calcified hematoma (2:116, 300B:26).
BONE WINDOW: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are
identified.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine are
seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive widespread atherosclerotic disease including
calcifcations thoughout the entire aorta, specifically the
ascending aorta and aortic arch.
Severe coronary artery calcifications.
2. Left upper lobe 6-mm pulmonary nodule and right lower lobe
4-mm pulmonary nodule. If this patient has no history of smoking
or malignancy, followup CT in 12 months is recommended.
Otherwise, followup CT in 6 months is recommended.
3. Rim-calcified 3.6-cm structure in continuity with or just
anterior to the right common femoral artery could be a
pseudoaneurysm of the adjacent artery or may represent a
calcified hematoma. Further evaluation with ultrasound or prior
imaging could provide additional information.

[**1-/2080**] CAROTID SERIES
Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On
the right there is mild heterogeneous plaque seen in the ICA. On
the left
there is mild heterogeneous plaque seen in the ICA.
On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 98/22, 100/36, 91/25 cm/sec. CCA peak
systolic
velocity is 97 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 116 cm/sec.
The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.0. These findin
