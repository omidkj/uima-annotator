History of Present Illness:
HPI: 74 yo F with HTN, DM2, COPD who developed endocarditis s/p
total hip replacement.  Briefly, the patient had a hip
replacement 8 months prior to admission.  Presented to [**Hospital **]
hospital [**1-28**] with fever, SOB, CP, and L hip pain.  Grew [**3-8**]
bottles B strep on blood cx and placed on IV ampicillin.  TEE
[**1-31**] veg on post MV and veg on aortic.  Decided to treat
medically [**1-6**] poor surgical candidate.  Repeat TEE [**2-9**] revealed
increasing size of the vegitations and an aortic root with
abcess.  Of note, the patient had a neg hip aspiration and spine
MRI.  Also while in OSH the patient developed afib with RVR.
.
Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-11**] for consideration of
surgical treatment of her endocarditis.  However on the day of
transfer the patient had an asystole arrest.  CPR was initiated
and she was brought back to afib.  (Required epi and atropine x
5.)
.
Hospital Course:  Unfortunately since the code the patient has
had poor neurologic performance.  Neuro consulted.  MRI/MRA of
head was initially read as within normal limits.  Afib initially
controlled with dilt gtt.  On admission to the CCU, the patient
was in NSR off gtt.  Over the past day the patient has been
having worsening secretions and CXR.

Reports:
[**2-11**] non contrast Head CT - No acute intracranial pathology
including no sign of intracranial hemorrhage.
[**2-14**] EEG - encephalopathy, no seizures
[**2-14**] TEE - Aortic valve endocarditis with aortic root abscess
and moderate to severe aortic regurgitation. Posterior mitral
leaflet prolapse/flail with at least moderate mitral
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study from the outside hospital of
[**2174-2-9**] (CD reviewed), the discrete mitral valve vegetation is no
longer seen, but the severity of mitral regurgitation has
markedly increased and partial posterior leaflet flail is now
identified. The aortic valve vegetation is slightly larger. The
posterior abscess is similar in size.   EF > 55%
3/13 Head MRI - No acute territorial infarct seen within the
brain.  Limited MRA exam by motion artifact.  There is no
intracranial vascular stenoses or occlusions.
[**2-16**] CXR - Stable cardiomegaly with worsening pulmonary edema.
Improved left lower lobe atelectasis. Bilateral small pleural
effusions.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2174-2-17**] 2:00 PM
INDICATION: Endocarditis, fever, status post anoxic brain
injury.
COMPARISON: [**2174-2-12**].
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT scan.
FINDINGS: Compared to prior study, there has been global loss of
the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter differentiation, worrisome for edema. No
intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures
is apparent. Surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Global loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation
concerning for
NOTE: In retrospective review of the preceding [**Hospital1 18**] MR study,
there is a suggestion of restricted diffusion of a substantial
portion of the cerebral cortex bilaterally, particularly
posteriorly, that would also be consistent with a global anoxic
brain injury.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo F with HTN, DM2, COPD who developed endocarditis s/p total
hip replacement.  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-11**] for
consideration of surgical treatment of her endocarditis.
However on the day of transfer the patient had an asystole
arrest.  CPR was initiated and she was brought back to afib.
(Required epi and atropine x 5).  On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was
intubated and obtunded.  Given her neurological status, CT
surgery decided to postpone surgery to determine if her
neurologic status was reversible.  An initial head CT was
normal.  Neurology was consulted who recommended an MRI/MRA of
the head, which was initially read as within normal limits with
some motion artifact.  An EEG was consistent with toxic
metabolic encephalopathy.  She subsequently developed Afib with
RVR that was initially controlled with a diltiazem drip.  She
spontaneously recoverted into NSR.  ID was consulted, and they
recommended continuing ampicillin for her endocarditis as she
remained afebrile.  A follow-up TEE on [**2-14**], when compared to
the TEE at the OSH showed a mitral valve vegetation that was no
longer seen, worsened mitral regurgitation with partial
posterior leaflet flail, a larger aortic valve vegetation, and a
posterior abscess that was similar in size.  Her CXR on
admission showed moderate CHF which progressively worsened over
the course of her admission secondary to her severe AI and MR.
She was initially diuresed with lasix, but gradually became
unresponsive to even a lasix drip.  Her acute renal failure from
admission (BUN 73, Cr 2.0), thought to be secondary to her
asystole vs. embolism from her endocarditis vs. AIN from her
antibiotics, worsened.  Renal was consulted and recommended an
ultrasound of her kidneys and urine eos - both of which returned
negative.  She became febrile again on [**2-16**] and was pancultured
and started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl for empiric
coverage of ventilator assocaited pneumonia according to
infectious disease recommendations.  Neurology recommended a
repeat head CT, which showed loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction
differentiation consistent with anoxic brain injury.  Her
initial MRI/MRA was re-read and the changes that were initially
thought to be secondary to motion artifact were felt to be
consistent with anoxic brain injury as well.  Neurology
performed caloric testing to which she had a very minimal
pupillary response suggesting brainstem injury.  She redeveloped
AF with RVR which was resistant to amiodarone.  She became
hypotensive and was started on levophed.  Her lactate increased
to 10 and she became acidotic and hyperkalemic.  Her health care
proxy, Sister [**Name (NI) 1743**] was updated on her condition, and decided
to make her comfort measures only.  Her pressors were withdrawn
and she was taken off the ventilator and passed away shortly
afterwards with members of her convent present.  Her family (a
nephew) was notified by Sister [**Name (NI) 1743**].
