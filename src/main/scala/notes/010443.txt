Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Left lower extremity calf pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 32 year old male with HIV/AIDS not on
anti-retroviral therapy(last CD4 5 on [**2189-1-28**]), history of
coagulase negative staph endocarditis status post aortic valve
replacement and mitral valve replacement in [**1-25**], strep viridans
prosthetic valve endocarditis in [**8-25**] complicated by aortic root
abscess (medically managed), and end stage kidney disease on
hemodialysis who presented with chief complain of left lower
extremity pain.   He reported a sharp pain in the back of his
calf that began three days prior to presentation associated with
this he reported worsening of his bilateral lower extremity
edema over several weeks prior to presentation.

Regarding other issues he reported that his baseline dyspnea on
exertion that he had for months had worsened over the previous
few weeks.  He reports that he has dyspnea when walking only a
few steps. Overall, he reported being very sedentary and
spending the majority of his day in bed due to his multiple
medical problems.  [**Name (NI) **] uses oxygen at home as much as possible.
He denied cough, chest pain, increased sputum, or pleuritic
chest pain. He reported chronic orthopnea and denied paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.  In addition, he reported nausea/vomiting
over the past few days prior to admission. He reported
non-bloody, non-bilious emesis after each meal.  He also had
diarrhea with 6-7 loose stools per day over the three days prior
to admission without blood. On presentation he was denying
abdominal pain but said he had had it over the past days.

In the ED, vitals were T96.5, BP 100/71, HR 116, RR 20O2 Sat
100% on 3L. Patient was given vancomycin, levoflaxcin, and
pipercillin-tazobactam due to question of right lower lobe
infiltrate and new effusion.  He was given 1LNS. Initial labs
revealed LFT's elevated from baseline so a RUQ U/S was performed
that showed no acute biliary pathology but findings consistent
with cirrhosis.

Review of Systems:
====================
Positives are per HPI.  He denied fevers, chills, or night
sweats.  Denied headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied constipation or abdominal
pain. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.


Past Medical History:
1.  HIV/AIDS, CD4 count of 5 in [**1-26**].  Not on HARRT.
2.  History of native valve bacterial endocarditis with
coagulase negative staph in [**1-/2188**] requiring mitral and aortic
valve replacements and four weeks of vancomycin
3.  Prosthetic valve endocarditis in fall of [**2187**] with strep
viridans, medically managed with prolonged vancomycin and
gentamicin therapy complicated by partial dehiscence of
prosthetic aortic valve  (also had pacemaker placed temporarily
for symptomatic 1st degree AV delay but this was removed due to
pocket infection)
3.  Chronic hepatitis C though no circulating virus
4.  Hepatitis B infection + but HBc equivocal [**10/2186**]
5.  End stage renal disease (hemodialysis dependent) secondary
to HIV nephropathy and focal sclerosing glomerulonephritis
6.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism secondary to ESRD
7.  Chronic low back pain reportedly to osteoarthritis & nerve
impingement
8.  Asthma


Social History:
He reports a short period of IVDU during his teens but denies
any use since then.  Per his report he acquired HIV through
sexual contact.  [**Name (NI) 15110**] to his multiple medical problems and poor
physical condition he lives with his mother.  Smoked 1 ppd for
20 years and currently smoking 6 cigarettes/day.


Family History:
Notable for DM and HTN in his father.

OTHER STUDIES
===============
ECG [**2189-2-24**]:
Sinus rhythm. Right axis deviation. Left atrial enlargement.
Left
ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave change. Compared to the
previous
tracing of [**2188-10-27**] no diagnostic interim change.

Chest Radiograph [**2189-2-24**]:
IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia with pleural effusion.
Cardiomegaly
with vascular engorgement.
RUQ ultrasound - No acute cholecystitis.

Right Upper Quadrant Ultrasound [**2189-2-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Presence of gallbladder wall thickening and right upper
quadrant ascites
is likely related to liver disease. No definite signs of acute
cholecystitis.
2. Right pleural effusion.

Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasounds [**2189-2-24**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.

Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2189-2-24**]:
Conclusions:
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic left and right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral
and tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets are
thickened. Motion of the aortic annulus is abnormal and
suggestive of partial dehiscence. There is a probable vegetation
on the aortic valve. Mild to moderate ([**12-19**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis
is present. The prosthetic mitral valv
