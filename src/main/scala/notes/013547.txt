History of Present Illness:
37 y.o male with pmhx of non insulin dependent DM was walking
home from [**Last Name (un) 1445**] [**Doctor Last Name **] when he fell down. He did not strike his
head or lose consciousness. He has felt ill for the past several
days and has been vomiting X 5 billious nonbloody, last episode
yesterday. Associated with vomiting is constant nausea, mid
abodminal pain, constant [**4-23**], crampy, and exacerbated by
movement/p.o intake. He endorses decreased intake because of "no
appetite." At baseline he has [**1-17**] loose brown BM per day and
denies any recent changes to this. This loose BM are thought to
be due to his "diabetes medications." He also endorses a
nonproductive cough for 2-3 days duration associated with
fevers/chills. Denies recent travel, sick contacts, dyspnea,
chest pain, alcohol intake,confusion, hematochezia, melena,
vision changes, headaches. He was found to be hyperglycemic,
tachypnic and CXR revealed LLL consolidation.

IMAGES:
CXR [**7-10**]:  Large left mid and lower lung zone pneumonia.
Recommend repeat
chest radiograph after treatment to ensure resolution.

ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is severe symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. A mid-cavitary gradient is identified. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severe LVH c/w hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

CXR [**7-11**]:Endotracheal tube has been advanced, now terminating in
standard
position about 4.5 cm above the carina.  Extensive pneumonic
consolidation is again visualized in the left perihilar and
basilar regions with adjacent moderate left pleural effusion,
but no definite pneumothorax or
hydropneumothorax is visualized on this semi-upright study.  New
patchy
opacity at right lung base could reflect patchy atelectasis,
aspiration or
additional site of pneumonia.

CT CHEST [**7-11**]: 1.  Extensive left upper and lower lobe
consolidation consistent with given history of pneumonia with
right lower lobe atelectasis and superimposed consolidation.
Trace right-sided and small-to-moderate left-sided pleural
effusions.  No evidence of hydropneumothorax.
2.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy may be reactive and can be
reassessed after resolution of pneumonia.
3.  Nonobstructing right upper pole renal stone.
