CXR
[**2120-2-28**]: Persistent low lung volumes, widening of mediastinum
and cardiomegaly have markedly improved. There is no evident
pneumothorax. Multifocal subsegmental atelectases are present in
the right upper lobe, right lower lobe and left lower lobe.
Pulmonary edema has resolved. Left pleural effusion is small.
Thickening of the right pleural margin is unchanged, this is
likely pleural effusion.
[**2120-2-27**]: In comparison with the study of [**2-26**], there are
continued low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette. Indistinctness of
engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with some increasing
pulmonary venous pressure. Widening of the superior mediastinum
is seen, suggesting
engorgement of the vascular pedicle. Bibasilar atelectatic
change with probable small pleural effusions.
[**2120-2-25**]: Frontal chest radiograph compared to multiple prior
examinations. Again noted are multiple leads projecting over the
chest of unclear etiology. Unclear if these are within or
outside the patient. Otherwise, there is patchy airspace opacity
in right upper lung zone, bilateral lung bases. Low lung
volumes.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 55484**] was admitted on [**2120-2-23**] following  Right
thoracotomy and tracheobronchoplasty with mesh (intrathoracic

intermedius bronchoplasty with mesh, left
main stem bronchus bronchoplasty with mesh), flexible
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. He was transfer to the
TSICU intubated and immediately successfully extubated.
Aggressive pulmonary toilet, mucolytics nebs were administered.
His pain was controlled with an Bupivacaine Epidural managed by
the acute pain service.

Respiratory: aggressive pulmonary toilets, mucolytic nebs, chest
PT & incentive spirometer Q2H while in the TISCU. Once on the
floor nebs, IS  ambulation and good pain control he titrated off
oxygen with room air saturations 99% at rest, 92 % ambulation
and 94% during sleep.  He does have a history of sleep apnea but
did not require CPAP/BiPAP.  His persistent cough improved.

Chest-tube: right [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain once drainage decreased was

and started on low dose beta-blocker 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] with heart rate
70-80's sinus.

GI: aggressive bowel regime and PPI's were continued.  He
required additional laxatives for large amount of stool seen on
chest film with good reponse.

Renal: On [**2120-2-27**] he required gentle diuresis for volume
overload noted on exam.  His renal function remained normal with
good urine output.  The foley was removed [**2120-2-27**].  His lytes
were replete as needed.

Pain: Dilaudid/Bupavicaine epidural managed by the acute pain
service was removed [**2120-2-26**].  He was transitioned to PO
narcotics, NSAIDs and acetaminophen with good pain control.

Infectious Disease: Intra-op BAL positive for H. flu. Started
ciprofloxacin ([**2-25**])

Endocrine: BS < 150.

Disposition: he was seen by physical therapy for exercises to
maintain upper extremity ROM.  He continued to do well and was
discharge to home with his family on [**2120-2-29**].  He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
