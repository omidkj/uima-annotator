Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted from ED with Type B aortic dissection, uncontrolled
hypertension and pain. He was admitted to the CVICU and placed
on nipride/esmolol drips for blood pressure control. His INR was
sub-therapeutic and he was started on a heparin gtt for his
mechanical avr. Given his heavy ETOH history, the pt was placed
on withdrawl precautions and a ciwa scale. He was evaluated by
the cardiology service who made recommendations for oral blood
pressure meds.  His drips were weaned off and his BP was
controlled with oral agents. Once off the drips he was
transfered to the VICU where he continued to be monitored
closely. His pain and blood pressure were well controlled.  He
was seen by addiction medicine and social work and followed
throughout his stay.  CT scan showed:"thoracic aorta dissection
most consistent with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 11916**] type B dissection. The
dissection starts just distal to the left subclavian artery and
ends just proximal to the bilateral renal arteries. The
dissection extends into the proximal SMA. The visualized vessels
are patent."  Cardiac surgery was consulted and evaluated the
patient. They determined that he would need an open repair and
asked for a cardiac catheterization prior to surgery. On [**12-16**]
the patient went for a cardiac cath, which showed no coronary
artery disease. He remained in the VICU through [**12-17**] at which
time it was determined he was stable for discharge home. His
pain and blood pressure were well controlled. He will return in
a few weeks for open surgical repair of his dissection with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  We reviewed the seriousness of
his condition, including the importance of medication
compliance, blood pressure control and refraining from any
drugs.
