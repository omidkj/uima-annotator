      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
                                    IN PAIRS.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2176-4-16**]):
      SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
BLOOD CX: PENDING
URINE CX: NO GROWTH
.
CXR [**2176-4-13**]:
One view.  Comparison with the previous study done earlier the
same day.  The lungs remain clear.  The heart and mediastinal
structures are unremarkable and unchanged.  An endotracheal tube
has been inserted and terminates at the thoracic inlet.  A
nasogastric tube has been inserted and ends beneath the left
hemidiaphragm in the region of the gastric fundus.  A fracture
of the right seventh rib is again demonstrated.
IMPRESSION:  Status post intubation.  No other significant
change.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P  59 year old woman with history of asthma/COPD and paranoid
schizophrenia, admitted with hypoxia and hyponatremia.

1) HYPOXIA: Suspect COPD flare due to URI.  No pneumonia on
chest xray.  She initially required intubation but was quickly
weaned and treated with azithromycin, steroids, and nebs.  A
MRSA swab is pending given GPC were noted on sputum gram stain
but given her clincal improvement, she does not need any further
antibiotics at this time, regardless of the results of this
test.  Her O2 sats are now in the low 90s on room air with
occasional desats into the upper 80s.  She has completed her
azithromycin and is weaning off the steroids.  She will continue
on advair and tiotropium with prn albuterol as an outpatient.
Please encourage continued incentive spirometer.
.
2) HYPONATREMIA: Suspect psychogenic polydypsia given low urine
osm (so unlikely SIADH) and continued to improve with subsequent
lasix diuresis (so unlikely hypovolemia).  Her sodium remained
stable in house on a 2 liter fluid restriction.
.
3) IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA: Hematocrit remained stable at 33 and
patient was continued on her iron.
.
4) SCHIZOPHRENIA: Psychiatry was consulted in house to assess
her competency.  They feel patient does not have the capacity to
make the decision to leave DMH housing and agree with pursuing
guardianship, as PCP is [**Name Initial (PRE) 49722**].  They suggested continuing her
current psychiatric regimen.  Patient's mood remained stable.
She had no suicidal ideation or hallucinations.
.
5) METABOLIC ALKALOSIS: Onset following intubation, even without
diuresis.  Suspect due to quick correction of a chronic
respiratory acidosis.  Her bicarb is now improving.
.
6) DISPO:  Patient discharged to [**Hospital3 537**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 49723**])
