Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with history of CAD with ischemic
cardiomyopathy EF 25%, CHF, recurrent VT s/p ICD placement, who
presented to OSH with worsening shortness of breath and SVT with
ventricular rates in the 110s.  He was recently seen by his
cardiologist, Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 23246**], who actually had increased his Coreg
to 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d. on [**5-31**] after the patient had shown
some evidence of possible SVT. The patient has a pacemaker, the
settings of which have been changed from DDI to DDD after he was
noted to have complete heart block.  Over the past two weeks, he
was noted to have worsening orthopnea, shortness of breath at
rest and exertion, and lower extremity edema.  He presented to
[**Hospital1 **] on [**7-4**] with these complaints after his VNA noticed
increased dyspnea on exertion at home; at [**Hospital1 **] he got a
repeat echo which showed worsened valve area to 0.7 and EF
worsened to 25%.  He was noted to have episodes of paroxysmal
SVT with ventricular rates ~110s.  Given that adjustment of his
pacer may be required, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
Review of systems: He does not have any fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, no abdominal pain. The patient does have a significant
cardiac history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and known ejection
fraction of 2%, and also mitral regurgitation and aortic
incompetence and aortic stenosis. The patient is DNR.


Past Medical History:
(1) CAD status post MI
(2) CHF  w/ AR, MR, echo today showing EF 25% (worsened compared
to [**12-11**])
(3) ischemic cardiomyopathy, right bundle branch block with
fascicular
block, question of complete heart block, recurrent ventricular
tachycardia.
(4) prostate cancer
(5) arthritis


Social History:
 nonsmoker. No EtOH.  Worked as economy professor [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and
other [**Location (un) 86**] schools for much of his life.  Married with 3
children.


Family History:
Unremarkable


Physical Exam:
VS: BP 84/50, HR 98, temp 98.9, O2 sat 94% 2L
Gen: Pleasant, elderly male, hard of hearing, in no apparent
distress
Neck: JVP not significantly elevated, supple
Cardiac: difficult to appreciate heart sounds, S1/S2 noted, no
murmur evident
Resp: mild rales at lung bases
Abd: obese, nontender, tympanic abdomen

[**2164-7-5**] Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = [**11-16**] %). Doppler parameters are most
consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction
and moderate aortic stenosis.
.
[**2164-7-4**] CXR:
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2158-6-3**].

There is interval development of pulmonary edema, moderate
accompanied by
bilateral pleural effusions. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. The
pacemaker leads are in place. The previously demonstrated
tortuous descending aorta is less seen on the current study most
likely due to oblique position of the patient.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of ischemic
cardiomyopathy with EF of 10%, moderate-severe aortic stenosis,
CHF, recurrent VT, now presenting with worsening shortness of
breath, orthopnea and lower extremity edema in the setting of
SVT.
.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic congestive Heart Failure EF: 10%:
Trigger is likely secondary to SVT with 1:1 ventricular tracking
worsening underlying systolic dysfunction leading to pulmonary
edema.  Echo was done and AS classified as moderate with valve
area 1.0-1.2. Patient was diuresed. Symptoms improved prior to
discharge, not pt has no peripheral edema or crackles on exam.
His weight is 159.2 pounds. His spironolactone was changed to
furosemide and Carvedilol was changed to Metoprolol for
borderline BP's.
.
# Hypotension - Has low BPs are baseline apparently. Coreg
stopped and metoprolol started. Spironolactone discontinued. SBP
> 90 prior to discharge. Would have high tolerance for BP's in
80's-90's as long as patient is not symptomatic. Avoid holding
diuretics for low BP.
.
# SVT: EP interogated pacemaker and adjusted settings. Patient
started on amiodarone [**Hospital1 **] for total of 5 gram load, will
decrease to 200 mg daily in 1 week. Pt will f/u with his
electrophysiology doctor [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 620**] in 2 weeks.
.
# Coronary Disease:  Troponins flat at OSH.  EKG does not show
any evidence of active ischemia. Patient discharged on
beta-[**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, and ACE inhibitor.
.
# Ischemic cardiomyopathy - EF of [**11-16**]%. Has ICD in place
secondary to recurrent VT in setting of low EF. Patient on BB
and ACE-I and lasix.
.
# Arthritis - continue prednisone and salsalate, treated by
outpatient PCP.
.
#  Depression - continue fluoxetine and perphenazine
.
#  Prostate cancer - Gets monthly leupron injections. Stable.
.
CODE: DNR/DNI, confort care form with pt. Please assess if pt
and family would prefer "Do Not Hospitalize". Pt may be a
candidate for long term care. This was discussed in the hospital
with his wife and children and should be continued after
discharge.
