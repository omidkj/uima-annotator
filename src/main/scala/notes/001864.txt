HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
female, who was transferred from an outside hospital for an
infected pancreatic pseudocyst.  She has a history of
gallstone pancreatitis for which she came to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital in [**2169-4-10**].  In [**Month (only) 547**], she developed
a pseudocyst, which was felt to have decreased in size on
followup CT.  However, the patient presented to her primary
care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2169-6-12**] with a complaint of 10 days of
malaise and decreased appetite.  She was admitted to the
outside hospital on [**6-13**] and started on IV antibiotics.  A
preliminary CT scan report showed "evidence of pancreatic
abscess with pockets of air."

On admission to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital, the patient
reports feeling weak and tired without a desire to eat.  She
denies abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or fevers.

ALT 69, total bilirubin 0.6, alkaline phosphatase 229,
amylase 69, lipase 210.  Dilantin 1.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for a pancreatic
abscess status post gallstone pancreatitis, made NPO, placed
on IV fluids, and Zosyn was started.  Blood cultures were
also drawn, which were subsequently negative.  The patient's
laboratories on admission included a hematocrit of 24.4, for
which the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
The patient also had Dilantin levels drawn, which were
initially 2.9.  She was loaded with Dilantin, and over the
course of the remainder of her hospital stay she remained in
the 10-20 range, the last Dilantin level being 12.8 on [**7-1**].

On hospital day three, the patient received a PICC line and
began receiving TPN with the expectation that she would go to
the OR once her nutritional status was improved.  The patient
continued to be afebrile with Zosyn and TPN until she was
taken to the OR on hospital day 11 ([**2169-6-20**]).  The
patient's hematocrit had remained stable up to that point and
was 28.8 on the day of her surgery.

On [**2169-6-20**], the patient underwent an open cholecystectomy
along with open drainage of the pancreatic pseudocyst.
Patient tolerated the procedure well.  Please see dictated OP
note for further details.  Intraoperatively, two swabs and a
tissue culture were taken and sent.  They later came back
with vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus.  The patient was
presumptively treated with Zosyn and fluconazole
postoperatively.

In the course of the operation, the patient required a total
of 10 liters of fluid and due to low urine output
postoperatively, the patient continued to require ongoing
fluids to maintain her urine output.  The patient, on the day
of the operation, positive 6 liters on postoperative day one.
On postoperative day two, the fluid requirement decreased and
the patient was net 0 fluids.  Because of the large quantity
of fluids required, patient was kept intubated and sedated
for several days.

On postoperative day two with a hematocrit of 27, the patient
received 1 unit of packed red blood cells.  This brought her
hematocrit only up to 29.

On postoperative day three, the patient's TPN was restarted
and the patient was begun on vancomycin along with Zosyn and
fluconazole.  The patient's white blood cell count
postoperatively had been elevated up to 23.6, but by [**6-25**]
was down to 12.7, and continued to trend down from there
until two days prior to discharge when her white blood cell
count had leveled out at 7.5.

On postoperative day three, diuresis was begun and the
patient was a net negative 2 liters for the day.  This level
of diuresis continued to through postoperative day nine as
the patient remained in the ICU, that is to say she lost
approximately 1.5 to 2 liters per day during that period.

On [**6-26**], a routine rectal swab showed vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus in the patient's rectum, however, it was not
thought that the patient required any change in her
antibiotics, so she was kept on Zosyn and vancomycin, the
fluconazole haven been stopped a few days prior.

The patient continued to be difficult to extubate and on
[**7-1**], underwent a bronch with a culture that was ultimately
negative.  On postoperative day 13, the patient's wound was
noted to have a bit of cellulitis on the right and was
therefore opened and packed with wet-to-dry dressing.  The
patient was finally extubated on postoperative day 13 after a
very long vent wean.  Wound cultures were sent from the open
wound and later came back as showing rare growth of gram-
positive cocci.  Patient was continued on her TPN and tube
feeds were begun.  However, those tube feeds were relatively
short-lived and the patient was started on a clear diet on
postoperative day 14 and sent to a floor.  Also all of her
oral medications were restarted.  She continued, however, on
TPN.

The other side of the patient's wound was later opened and
packed wet-to-dry so that both sides were ultimately opened
on the patient's discharge.  The two sides were opened
approximately 3 cm with the left side draining a greater
amount of fluid than the right.

On the floor, the patient did well, tolerated her clear diet,
and was advanced to a regular diet without difficulty.  Her
TPN was ended on the day of her discharge, and a repeat
surveillance CT was obtained.  Please see the CT report for
details.  The patient was discharged to a rehab facility on
[**2169-7-7**].
