History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 56yoF with chronic renal failure s/p DDRT in
[**2127**] due to congenitally malformed kidneys, HTN, neuropathy,
lung mass resection, GERD, depression who is transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] Hosptial for management of fevers and confusion,
nosebleed, and unsteady gait.
She was found by her neighbors found her stumbling, who then
activated EMS.  At OSH, she was febrile to 103 and empirically
got vanco/ctx.  CXR benign per report.  CT head revealed a basal
ganglia bleed versus mass, so she was given 100mg IV methylpred.
 Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were T99.3, HR89, BP181/94, RR18,
Sat98%RA. Neurosurgery consulted but felt patient would be
better suited to medicine service due to elevated creatinine and
mild transaminitis.  Recommended MRI/MRA for better evaluation
of the bleed/mass with BP control to systolics<140.  Got IV
lopressor x2 with BP to 160.  Creatinine appears at recent
baseline- she has chronic renal disease of her graft with biopsy
showing widespread sclerosis earlier this summer.
.
On arrival to the MICU, initial VS were T99.4 P83 BP147/84 RR18
97RA.  The patient is a difficult historian, needing directed
questions to elicit a story. She relates intermittent fevers for
the past 3 weeks up to 102.  Over past three days, noting vague
abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting in the morning.
Diarrhea 4 times daily. She feels generally weak and has been
walking unsteadily.  She feels confused. No neck stiffness,
though with some photophobia. Mild SOB. No dysuria, hematuria.
No rashes

STUDIES:
MR HEAD:
CONCLUSION: Interval development of extensive zone of T2
hyperintensity, with some mass effect in the left basal ganglia
and subinsular white matter. Right posterior temporal/occipital
lesion, which is smaller compared to the other lesion. In the
prior MR report, there was a provided history of renal
transplantation and immunosuppression. The findings could
represent multiple areas of infarction, with hemorrhagic
elements. However, given the history of immunosuppression, it is
conceivable, though not as likely, that a superimposed
infectious process could be considered. Obviously, a more
detailed work-up is necessary at this time.
.
[**2146-11-1**] Renal ultrasound transplant:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric
collection. Resistive indices of 0.75-0.82, slightly increased
as compared to [**2146-4-9**].
.
[**2146-11-1**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because of focal slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies
over the left hemisphere indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction in this region. Moderate diffuse background slowing
is indicative of a moderate to severe diffuse encephalopathy
which is etiologically non-specific. No epileptiform discharges
or electographic seizures are present.
.
[**2146-11-2**] ECHO:
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Normal regional and global biventricular systolic function. No
significant valvular regurgitation seen. If clinically
indicated, a transesophageal echocardiogram may better assess
for valvular vegetations.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 56yoF renal transplant recipient who presents
with fevers, confusion found to have listeria bacteremia and
brain abscess.
.
# Listeria bacteremia and brain abscess:
Patient was initially covered with broad spectrum antibiotics
for fevers, delerium, and concern for brain abscess, which
included vancomycin, meropenem, and acyclovir. She grew listeria
on day 2 of admission and antibiotics were narrowed to
ampicillin and gentamycin. Patient required desensitization to
ampicillin. Patient markedly improved after starting ampicillin.
Patient is currently on ampicillin (for planned 6 - 8 week
course) and gentamyin (planned for at least one week).  The
patient was instructed to continue her ampicillin until [**2146-12-15**]
and she has follow up with ID at the beginning of [**Month (only) **].  She
also was instructed to get repeat brain imaging in 4 weeks to
evaluate the abscess.
.
# Delirium:  The patient was delirius during her MICU stay;
likely secondary to her CNS infection.  Neurology was consulted
while the patient was in the unit, and given the concern for
seizures, patient received one dose of keppra. However, the pt
had two EEGs, which were not suggestive of seizure activity and
the Keppra was stopped.
.
# Anemia: Patient had a drop in her HCT when she was first
admitted from 30 to 21.7 over one day. Patient found to have
guaiac positive brown stool. She was transfued 1 unit PRBC with
appropriate response. Etiology of anemia unclear, in ICU thought
possibly secondary to marrow supression given infection.  The
patient had lower end of normal TIBC and transferrin, with
elevated ferritin possibly suggestive of anemia of chronic
disease.  However, because the patient was acutely infected, her
ferritin levels are expected to be elevated because it is an
acute phase reactant.
.
# s/p kidney transplant: The patient was continued on her
immunosuppresive medications including her prednisone and MMF.
The patient's MMF was initially decreased in the unit
