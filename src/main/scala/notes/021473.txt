History of Present Illness:
64M with a hx of HIV and recent hospitilization for COPD
exacerbation presented with nephew complaining of several days
of worsening DOE, cough, and new AMS status this morning. Nephew
notes pt has baseline SOB with 3L o2 rec over past few months
with worsening cough over last several days. He cannot speak for
myself as he is too short of breath. His relative states the

frequency recently, currently smoking 1ppd. Nephew also notes
worsening AMS over last day, finding patient laying on bathroom
floor and not oriented to name or place. Family notes similar
episode of AMS in [**2165**] with [**Last Name (un) **]. In past documentation, has been
compliant with HAART therapy and Bactrim PPx. On recent
admission [**2169-9-15**], CD4 54 but HIV VL undetectable.

In the ED, initial VS were:97.8 99 122/63 25. PE was notable for
Patient has distant lung sounds without wheezes. CXR notable for
possible left lower lobe consolidation. Pt placed on BiPap and
ABG pH 7.16/82/106. CBC wnl, chem 7 remarkable for BUN 124 and
Cr 6.4 with AG of 24, lactate of 1.8.

On arrival to the MICU, he is sedated and intubated.

IMAGING
[**10-28**] RUQ Ultrasound:1-cm stone in the distal common bile duct
with distal dilatation of the CBD without intrahepatic ductal
dilatation.

[**10-23**] Renal US
IMPRESSION:
1.  No hydronephrosis. Stable asymmetry of renal sizes
consistent with chronic scarring of left kidney.
2.   Bladder not assessed due to foley catheter in place.
3.   Pelvic ascites.

[**10-23**] RUQ US
IMPRESSION:
1.  Gallbladder has been surgically removed.  Stable dilatation
of the common bile duct, unchanged compared to [**2166-3-16**].  Duct
is well seen to the level of the ampulla and no stones are
identified.
2.  Doppler assessment of the main portal vein shows patency and
hepatopetal flow.
3.  Minimal perihepatic ascites identified.
4.  Liver echotexture is normal and without a macronodular
contour to suggest cirrhosis.

[**10-22**] CXR
IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal study due to patient positioning.
Interval
development of left mid to lower lung patchy opacity may relate
to infection or aspiration versus asymmetric edema.  Trace
blunting of the right costophrenic angle, trace pleural effusion
not excluded.  Consider PA and lateral views when/if patient
able with better positioning.

ECG
Sinus rhythm. Normal ECG. Compared to the previous tracing
atrial
fibrillation has resolved and pacing is no longer appreciated.
