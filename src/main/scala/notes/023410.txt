ADDENDUM:  This is an Addendum to the Discharge Summary that
was done on [**2125-4-3**] to [**2125-4-20**].  This addendum
addresses hospital events from [**2125-4-20**] to [**2125-4-27**].

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM (CONTINUED):

1.  NEUROLOGIC/LEFT MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY INFARCTION ISSUES:
The patient was initially put on a ACE inhibitor.  For atrial
fibrillation, she was put on a beta blocker.  She was then given
a statin and baby aspirin for further stroke prevention.  In one
month, she should discontinue aspirin and be restarted on her
Coumadin for anticoagulation for her atrial fibrillation.

2.  HEMATOLOGY/DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION/ANEMIA
OF CHRONIC DISEASE ISSUES:  By the time the patient came to
the Neurology floor, she was no longer having any blood
transfusions.  Her hematocrit remained stable at 34.1, and
her platelets remained stable at 315.

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL/SHOCKED LIVER ISSUES:  When the patient
arrived to the Neurology floor, her alanine-aminotransferase
was rechecked and found to be low at 68, and aspartate
aminotransferase checked and found to be normal at 48.  Her
alkaline phosphatase was 182 and total bilirubin was 0.9;
which was the lowest that her numbers have ever been during
this hospital course.

4.  CARDIOLOGY/ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  Given the
patient's atrial fibrillation, it was decided that an
echocardiogram should be performed.  The echocardiogram
showed an ejection fraction of 40% with mild LVH and 2+
mitral regurgitation.  There was no evidence of a patent
foramen ovale or clot.  She was also ruled out for a
myocardial infarction a second time on the Neurology floor.

5.  PULMONARY EDEMA/PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  A chest x-ray was
repeated [**2125-4-25**] which showed resolving pulmonary edema, and no
evidence of pneumonia.  She was adequately treated with
antibiotics while on the Unit for her pneumonia.  She was
continued on Lasix for diuresis. While on the Neurology service,
she developed respiratory distress requiring transfer back to the
MICU on [**2125-4-27**]. CXR/ ABG pending at the time of this note.

6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/URINARY TRACT INFECTION WITH YEAST
ISSUES:  The patient had a fever of 101, so she was
pan-cultured.  Urinalysis showed 99 white cells, 0 epithelial
cells, and many yeast.  Infectious Disease was curbside, and
they recommended that the Foley catheter be changed.  They
also recommended that she be started on fluconazole 100 mg
per day for one week.  In addition to starting the
fluconazole, her peripherally inserted central catheter line
was removed and tip sent for culture.  Blood cultures and
sputum culture were also obtained. Repeat cultures performed
[**2125-4-27**] at time of transfer to MICU.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
 1.  Left middle cerebral artery infarction.
 2.  Atrial fibrillation.
 3.  Hypertension.
 4.  Diabetes.
 5.  Hypothyroidism.
 6.  Shocked liver.
 7.  Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
 8.  Anemia of chronic disease.
 9.  Pneumonia.
10.  Urinary tract infection.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
 1.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
 2.  Prevacid 30 mg by mouth once per day.
 3.  Synthroid 125 mcg by mouth once per day (on Monday
through Friday) and 75 mcg by mouth once per day (on Saturday
and Sunday).
 4.  Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg by mouth q.4-6h. as needed.
 5.  Dulcolax 10 mg by mouth/per rectum as needed.
 6.  Colace 150 mg by mouth twice per day.
 7.  Miconazole powder three times per day as needed.
 8.  Atorvastatin 20 mg by mouth once per day.
 9.  Lidocaine solution as needed.
10.  Nystatin solution as needed.
11.  Reglan 10 mg by mouth four times per day.
12.  Captopril 25 mg by mouth three times per day.
13.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth twice per day.
14.  Glycerin by mouth q.6h. as needed.
15.  Subcutaneous heparin 5000 units twice per day.
16.  Lopressor 6.25 mg by mouth three times per day.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  guarded.

TRANSFER STATUS:  To MICU

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed

discharge from the hospital. Patient will continue to be followed
by Neurology in-house.
