respiratory distress/?ARDS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

EGD with PEG placement ([**2160-3-11**])


History of Present Illness:
51F with PMH sig for COPD, Hep C, depression, sz d/o who
presented to OSH p 4 days of progressive SOB and subjective
fevers at home.  2 days PTA, pt seen by PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/o cough prod
of yellow sputum and was started on Levoquin for question of
PNA.  Pt presented to OSH [**2160-2-13**] after hallucinating at home
and increasing SOB.  Pt awoke the night of admission at home and
insisted to husband that there was someone in the house when
there was not.  At OSH CXR showed bilateral infiltrates and was
found to be hypoxic with O2 sat of 76% on RA.  At that time, she
was thought to have worsening PNA +/- CHF.  Her BNP was elevated
in the 800's.  She was started on BiPAP and transferred to the
ICU. She was given Ceftaz and Clinda as well as steroids for
presumed COPD flare.  She was diuresed with lasix. Her
oxygenation did not improve and she was combative with BiPAP, so
was intubated [**2160-2-15**].  She had a CTA that was negative for PE,
but showed patchy ground glass infiltrates with septal
thickening consistent with "crazy paving". Radiology ddx
included ARDS, PCP PNA, alveolar proteinosis, among others.
Vancomycin and Bactrim were added.  During the course at the
OSH, the pt had elevated CKs to 2400 with negative MB fraction
and negative troponin I. Her EKG shows small 1mm ST depressions
in the lateral leads from [**2-14**].  She had a negative UA, negative
influenza DFA, sputum cx that grew [**Female First Name (un) **], no PCP X 2.  Tox
screen was + for opiates on admission.  Pt was started on Zydis
for hallucinations before intubation.  On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt
was intubated and sedated, unable to answer questions. No family
available for further history.

Radiologic Studies:
CXR [**2160-4-3**]- There is no pneumothorax. There are small bilateral
pleural effusions, right greater than left. Again seen are the
diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities bilaterally, which have
slightly improved since prior exam. The findings are consistent
with the pulmonary consolidation of ARDS.
*
CT CHEST [**2160-3-12**]-IMPRESSION:
1) Limited study due to artifacts from the arms.
2) Worsening of bilateral patchy consolidation, especially in
the right upper and middle lobe, probably representing worsening
multifocal pneumonia in this patient with ARDS, however, the
consolidation can represent atypical edema.
3) Improvement of diffuse ground glass opacities representing
improving edema.
4) Slightly increased bilateral pleural effusion associated with
edematous atelectasis.
5) Slightly increased ascites with gallbladder edema.
6) Extensive edematous change of subcutaneous tissue of the
thorax and upper abdomen.
7) Persistent mediastinal lymphadenopathy
*
ABDOMINAL U/S [**2160-3-14**]- Limited portable scan was performed.
Small amount of ascites is identified, however, no dominant
pocket which could safely be accessed for fluid. There is
evidence of cholelithiasis. However, the gallbladder itself
shows no signs to suggest cholecystitis. The liver is
homogeneous in echo texture. There are no focal mass lesions or
dilated intrahepatic biliary radicles. Small bilateral pleural
effusions are appreciated
*
CTA [**2160-3-17**]- Negative for PE. bilateral consolidations c/w
multifocal pneumonia in this patient w/ ARDS
*
CT CHEST [**2160-2-17**]- IMPRESSION:
1) Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacity with septal
thickening. Confluent areas of dependent consolidation primarily
within the lower lobes. These findings could relate to pulmonary
edema, diffuse atypical lung infection such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] ARDS.
Possible contributing aspiration. The acuity of the respiratory
distress renders pulmonary alveolar proteinosis less likely,
although the ground-glass opacity and thickened septae could be
radiographically consistent with this diagnosis. Correlation
with bronchoscopic findings of same date are recommended.

2) Centrilobular nodular opacity in the right middle lobe,
suggests possible superimposed infectious process.

3) Ascites, hepatic enlargement, and possible varices,
incompletely imaged on this examination. Clinical correlation is
recommended. Could further evaluate with CT or US.

4) Prominence of the right and left adrenal glands, incompletely
imaged on the present examination. No definite focal masses are
visualized. Clinical correlation is recommended. Could further
evaluate with CT.

*
CXR [**2160-2-16**]- Diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltration is noted.
Appearance of the infiltration in the left upper lobe is more
pronounced at this time. Dense infiltration throughout the right
lung is unchanged.
*
CT Head [**2160-2-16**]- There is no intra or extraaxial hemorrhage,
midline shift, or mass effect. The ventricles are normal
