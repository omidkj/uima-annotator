HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This a 55 year old
right-handed man with a history of untreated hypertension who
collapsed in church on the evening of [**2178-3-24**], at 9:00
p.m.  He was witnessed to have seizures after he fell down.
He was immediately transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Department where the neurosurgery
team evaluated his case as unsalvageable.  His history is
that he had a stroke one year ago which left him with
residual left-sided weakness, however, he was able to
ambulate without a cane.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Left-sided weakness due the
cerebrovascular accident.

Untreated hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  He was on no medications.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives in [**Location **].  He was separated from
his wife and currently not working.  He has two children.

In transit by the EMT, he was noted to be posturing at the
scene with a GCS score of six.  On arrival with extensor
posturing, he was intubated and given Ativan 4 mg
intravenously and Propofol.  He was taken to the CT scanner
where he was found to have a four by seven centimeter left
basal ganglia bleed with intraventricular intraparenchymal
extension, effacement of the left ventricle and 1.6
centimeter subfalcial herniation, with also bleed into the
third ventricle and fourth ventricle.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, initially his blood
pressure was systolic 240 and diastolic in the 110s.  The
pupils were two millimeters and nonreactive bilaterally.  He
did have corneal reflexes bilaterally.  He extensor postured
mainly left upper extremity greater than the right.  He had
no movement of the right upper extremity.  He extended his
lower extremities and had upgoing toes on Babinski
examination.  He was subsequently seen by the neurology
service where corneal reflexes were absent.  There was no
response to visual threat.  His eye position was fixed to the
midline.  His funduscopic examination reveals severe
papilledema bilaterally, left greater than the right.  The
pupils were unequal in size.  The right was four millimeters
and the left was seven and neither reacted directly or
indirectly to light.  There was no nystagmus.  There was
conjugated deviation that was not present.  There was no good
receptor or noxious stimulation. Motor examination revealed
high tone overall.  He had decerebrate posturing
spontaneously and after noxious stimulation.  He was
hyperreflexic and had sustained and spontaneous clonus on the
left.  His toes were upgoing.

LABORATORY DATA:  His laboratories showed normal coagulation
parameters.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
service.  He was NPO and maintained on intravenous fluids.
He was continued on a Nitroprusside drip to his systolic
blood pressure less than 160.  He was on telemetry.  His
family came to see him on [**2178-3-24**], shortly after admission
and were notified of the poor neurological and grave
prognosis.  After discussion with the Intensive Care Unit and
neurology attending, it was decided to make him comfort
measures only and to withdraw ventilatory support.  He was
extubated at 7:00 p.m. on [**2178-3-24**], at the family's
request.  He was made comfortable on a Morphine Sulfate drip.
At 8:55 p.m. on [**2178-3-25**], neurology resident on call was
notified by the nurse that the patient had expired at 8:35.
He was comfortable at the time of death.  He was with his
clergy and his church at the time of his death.  The patient
was examined.  He had no pulse or spontaneous respirations.
He had no corneal reflexes and no responses to noxious
stimuli.  The patient's family, his son, [**Name (NI) 55657**], was called
and notified.  The family had agreed to an autopsy.
