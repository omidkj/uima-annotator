Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: The patient is a 68 year old female with a history of DMII,
HTN, HL, and asthma who presents with viral-like syndrome of
myalgias, fevers, cough and N/V x 3 days.

1. Fevers
- The patient presented with a leukocytosis, fever, cough, N/V,
mylagias with a history of DMII and asthma and no prior flu
shot. She was placed on droplet precautions and we started
amantadine on the day of admission. Her DFA was positive for
influenza A although her viral culture was negative.
- Her CXR showed a right lower lobe opacity which the
radiologist believed might be secondary to atelectasis. However,
we believed the patient may also have had a community-acquired
pneumonia especially in setting of leukocytosis with left shift.
As a result, she was started on Levoquin 500 mg PO Q24
empirically for CAP x 7 day total.

2. Asthma/COPD exacerbation
- The patient received salumederol in ER. We started her on 60
mg prednisone for a COPD exacerbation with a slow taper. She was
discharged on 30 mg and was told to continue this for 2 more
days and then decrease her dose to 10 mg for 3 days and then
discontinue the prednisone.
- The patient was discharged on 3 L O2, sat'ing 96% but in the
high 80s on room air. It was felt that the patient would require
home oxygen for approximately one week and then would follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 week to reassess her home O2 needs.
- She was continued on albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer
treatments.

3. DMII
- The patient's blood sugar was in the high 100s, at times 200.
She is diet-controlled as an outpatient but was originally
unaware, she claims, on admission that she was in fact diabetic
and had been eating McDonald's in the hospital. She was placed
on a sliding scale and should be followed as an outpatient.

4. HTN
- Hypertensive in the ED. Her Captopril was increased to 50 mg.

5. CHF, EF 70-80%
- Has diastolic dysfunction. Appeared dry on exam initially.
Stable during her admission.

6. Hyperlipidemia
- She was continued on Lipitor 20 mg, we added ASA.

7. Depression/anxiety
- She was continued on Buspar, Ativan prn as the patient takes
these at home.
