Neurology Service  for  new L MCA CVA.
Per Neurologist patient was doing better overall for the last 3
days and was ready to be discharged to rehab today. He was awake
until yesterday and although not able to talk, he was able to
slurry speak. For the last 24 h he became more somnolent and
with difficulty breathing. He had speech and swallow study
yesterday which he did not pass. For this reason a GY tube was
placed today.

worsened over the last 24 h. There is no clear history of
pulmonary disease . Upon evaluation he was breathing at 35 bpm ,
SPO2 was 95 % on NRB mask ABGs c pH 7.16 pCO2 59 pO2 62 HCO3 22
. Of note patient had a GJ tube placed yesterday and tube feeds
were started last night.
Patient's code status was discussed with the family . His health
care proxy stated clearly he is DNI/DNR , but expressed her
wishes to try non invasive measures. He was transferred to MICU
for eventual non invasive mechanical ventilation.
.
The pt's wife stated that he has recently been treated with
antibiotics (azithromyci for pneumonia as an outpatient) . He
seemed to have been improving over the past week, but has
complained of generalized fatigue. There is no further history
of antecedent illness prior to the event leading to
presentation.

General: Awake, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in
oropharynx
Neck: Supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated.
Pulmonary: Lungs with rhonchi bilaterally and transmitted upper
airway sounds
Cardiac: RRR, nl. S1S2, III/VI crescendo-decrescendo HSM at left
sternal border radiating into axilla
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or
organomegaly noted.
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, 2+ radial, DP pulses

Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert, regards examiner. He is able to state his
name and the month of the year.  He repeats words only, but
nothing more complex such as two word phrases. He closes eyes
and
shows tongue briefly to command, but does not follow more
complex
commands or appendicular commands.  When he speaks, his words
are
dysarthric.

-Cranial Nerves: Olfaction not tested.  PERRL 2.5 to 2mm. He
does
not appear to blink to threat on the right.  Funduscopic exam
was
technically impossible due to pt cooperation. His extraocular
movements are full, but he prefers to look to the left.  Right
facial droop. He prefers to keep head to left, suggesting
dysfunction of left sternocleidomastoid. Tongue protrudes in
midline.

-Motor: Somewhat atrophic musculature throughout. Tone is
flaccid
on the right. He will not cooperate with formal strength
testing,
but he is plegic on the right and briskly withdraws to noxious
stimuli on the left. No adventitious movements noted.

-Sensory: Brisk withdrawal to noxious stimuli on left, no
response on right.

-Coordination: Could not test due to pt cooperation.

CT: Moderate to large left middle cerebral artery early subacute
infarct. There is no evidence of herniation.

Carotid Echo: Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.

CXR: Mild improvement but persistent left retrocardiac opacity
consistent with improving left lower lobe pneumonia with small
adjacent effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M c Afib , new L sided MCA , CAD admitted for respiratory
failure and acidosis.   Most likely cause of respiratory failure
is aspiration considering the abrupt onset and that he was
recently started on tube feeds. He also has a new infiltrate on
CxR . Worseing mental status can also be contributing to
acidosis and hypoventilation. Pt met  criteria for intubation
although DNR/DNI. After evaluation of the patient with the team
and discussing his case with the family , it was decided to make
the patient CMO . This taking into consideration the patient's
poor prognosis and his wishes prior to having a CVA.
Case was discussed extensively between Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] , the
patient's family and health care proxy [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 34742**] and myself.
Patient expired after a  few minutes of his ICU admission.
