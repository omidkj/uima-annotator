HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48-year-old
male who was well known to the surgery service having had a
malignant pheochromocytoma resected in [**2134-8-20**]. At the
time he had multiple small liver metastases and a very large
malignant pheochromocytoma. The decision at that time was to
observe his liver metastases. Hence, the endocrinologist
thought that this would not create a problem.

The patient represented to [**Location (un) **] in late [**Month (only) 547**] with
distention and difficulty having bowel movements. He was also
found to have hypoxia based on shunting. No pulmonary
embolism was found. The patient had massive hepatomegaly
which may have been the cause of some of his pain. The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] and underwent a CT scan which confirmed the finding at
[**Hospital3 **]. We made multiple efforts to decompress the
colon with enemas and cathartics but this did not work. There
was some question as to whether he had a small bowel
obstruction. The patient did not progress and the decision
was made to take him to the operating room on [**2135-4-21**].

At this point, the patient had been transferred to the ICU
because of difficulty breathing. We were hoping to do
colonoscopy with the patient intubated but the GI service
felt that was probably not an option given his tenuous state.
Lysis of adhesions showed a transition point in the mid
jejunum with some lysis of adhesions but this did not appear
to be the cause for his bowel obstruction. The patient
developed acute renal failure requiring dialysis. By [**4-23**]
the hope was that he can be weaned from the ventilator. He
continued to require labetalol and nicardipine to control his
blood pressure. By [**4-24**], the patient had worsening chest x-
ray consistent with pneumonia. He was extubated on [**4-25**] but
no real progress was made on his ileus. He was started TPN.
At this point consideration for colonoscopy was reopened with
the GI team. The endocrine team recommended starting
doxazosin. The GI service continued to be reluctant to
perform colonoscopy. By [**4-26**] the patient was felt to be
stable but no progress was made in terms of GI function. The
decision was made to try to a Gastrografin enema both for
diagnosis and treatment as recommended by the GI service.

The patient continued to be somewhat unstable but was unable
to maintain his ventilatory status without intubation. By [**4-27**] he had a couple of small bowel movements after the
Gastrografin enema and the NG tube was removed because of
lack of output and discomfort. Unfortunately by [**4-28**] the
patient continued to do poorly and we felt that we had to do
a decompressive laparotomy for his pseudoobstruction with
high bladder pressures. On the beginning of the operation he
desaturated and the feeling was that he probably had an
endobronchial on the right and a left chest tube was placed
and the endotracheal tube was pulled back. Decompressive
laparotomy showed massive dilated loops of bowel without
specific obstruction. The cecum was very distended and
cecostomy tube was placed with a 26 Foley. The abdomen was
left open.

After this operation, the patient continued to deteriorate
with worsening respiratory status. On [**4-29**] the opened
abdomen was removed and bowel was visualized and appeared to
be pink and viable. There was some question as to whether it
was not viable, but this did not seem to be the case. The
patient continued to require high-dose pressors without much
response. A family meeting was held with the patient's wife
and they decided that given his current status and his
underlying condition, that they would proceed with comfort
measures only. On [**2135-4-30**], the patient expired at 5:20
p.m.

DIAGNOSIS:
1. Metastatic pheochromocytoma.
2. Colonic pseudo-obstruction.
3. Sepsis.
4. Renal failure.
5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome.
