Pertinent Results:
[**2152-12-26**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant system demonstrated left main coronary artery disease.
There was a 60% hazy lesion in the distal left main at the
bifurcation involving the left main, ostium of the LCx and the
LAD.  The LAD had moderate luminal disease.  The LCx stent was
widely patent.  The RCA was a large vessel
that tapered into a small subtotally occluded RPDA. 2. Resting
hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided filling
pressures with RVEDP 10mmHg and PCWP mean 6 mmHg.  The pulmonary
arterial systolic pressure was high normal PASP 33mmHg.  The
cardiac index was preserved at 3.16 l/min/m2. 3. Left
ventriculography was deferred. 4. An intraortic balloon pump was
placed sheathed via the right femoral artery, with systolic
unloading from 173 mmHg to 171 mmHg and diastolic augmentation
from 76 mmHg to 140 mmHg on [**11-17**] counterpulsation.
[**2152-12-27**] Echo: Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is
normal in size. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small and
underfilled. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully appreciated. LV systolic
function appears depressed (LVEF guess = 40%). The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2153-1-2**] 10:11 AM
Final Report HISTORY: CABG.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-29**], the right
central catheter
has been removed. Persistent opacification at the left base is
consistent
with volume loss in the lower lobe and effusion. The right lung
is
essentially clear.

 UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT Study Date of [**2152-12-26**] 10:38 AM
 64 year old woman with L sided calf tenderness, swelling
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    eval for DVT
Final Report
HISTORY: A 64-year-old female with left-sided calf tenderness
and swelling.
STUDY: Left lower extremity venous ultrasound.
COMPARISON: None.
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common
femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed. There
is normal
compressibility, flow and augmentation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7749**] was transferred from outside hospital on [**12-26**] for
cardiac cath and a Intra-aortic balloon pump placed. She was
brought urgently to operating room after cath for surgery with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Please see operative note for surgical details. In
summary she had: Emergency off-pump coronary artery bypass graft
x2 with Left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
artery and saphenous vein graft obtuse marginal artery.
Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein. She tolerated
the operation well and following surgery she was transferred to
the CVICU in stable condition on epinephrine, phenylephrine and
propofol drips. On post-op day one she was weaned from inotropic
and most of her pressor support, additionally her IABP was
removed. She remained intubated until post-op day two when she
was weaned from sedation and awoke neurologically intact.
Following extubations her pressors were weaned off and she was
started on beta-blockers and diuretics. Psychiatry was consulted
on post-op day three regarding the patient's
depression/mood/mental status. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing
wires were removed per cardiac surgery protocol. On post-op day
four she was transferred to the telemetry floor for further care
and to advance her activity level. The remainder of her
post-operative hospitalization was uneventful.
The wound nurse followed this patient during post-op course for
her sacral decubitus ulcer (and she also examined eschar at vein
harvest site). On post-op day six she had an episode of rapid
atrial fibrillation which was appropriately treated and she
converted back to sinus rhythm. On post-op day eight she was
discharged to rehab at [**Hospital 671**] Rehab at [**Hospital6 10353**] in
[**Hospital1 392**], MA.
