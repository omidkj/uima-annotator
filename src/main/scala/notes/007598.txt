History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79 yo R-handed man with Afib (on coumadin),
HTN, hyperlipidemia and blindness R-eye who was sent to the ED
by his PCP after [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 55006**] showed SDH.
The patient reports that he had a fall about one month ago while
walking in the [**Doctor Last Name 6641**] with a couple of friends. [**Name (NI) **] remembers that
he hurt his head while falling backwards. He denies loss of
consciousness and was able to walk without problems after he was
helped back to his feet by his friends. At the time he did
notdevelop a headache, weakness, double vision or numbness.
During the past month, the patient noted that he has been off
balance more frequently. He denies any further falls. He also
developed headaches. These were dull, located on both sides
patient is not able to specify the location) and were
intermittent. He cannot point to factors that made the headache
worse or better. Day of admission, the patient visited his PCP
for his gait problems. A head- CT was obtained that showed SDH.
The patient was then sent to the ED.

RADIOLOGY

HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: [**2140-10-30**]
Stable to slight increase in size of left subdural collection.
Minimal increase in shift of midline structures to the right.
Stable small right subdural collection.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST; [**2140-11-3**]
1. Large acute infarct involving almost the entire right middle
cerebral arterial distribution.

2. Abrupt loss of signal within the mid portion of the right M1
segment. This is either due to embolic occlusion or thrombosis.

3. Unchanged bilateral subdural hematomas.

4. Mild rightward subfalcine herniation, unchanged since earlier
head CT.

CTA OF THE CHEST W/CONTRAST AND RECONS;[**2140-11-11**]
1) Acute pulmonary embolus in the segmental branches to the
right middle and right upper lobe. Central pulmonary arterial
tree is patent and the left side appears normal.

2) Minimal rim of pleural fluid and minor subpleural atelectasis
at the right base. No consolidation or gross pulmonary edema
demonstrated.

VENA CAVA FILTER  [**2140-11-11**]
Successful placement of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter
with its tip immediately below the level of the renal veins. The
tip of the filter is at approximately the level of the inferior
endplate of the L1 vertebral body. A Bard Recovery filter was
used which is possible to be retrieved at any time.

[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT)  [**2140-11-13**]
No DVT
.
CXR [**2140-11-20**]:
Tracheostomy tube is 5 cm above carina. No pneumothorax. There
is persistent opacity at the left base consistent with
atelectasis/consolidation in the left lower lobe. Cannot rule
out associated small left pleural effusion. The right lung
remains clear.
.
CT of head [**2140-11-21**]:
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: No new intracranial hemorrhage
is identified. Increased conspicuity of both right and left
subdural hemorrhages from interval increased hypodensity of
these collections is noted, without appreciable change in size.
The ventricles are stable and normal in size.
Large right middle cerebral artery distribution infarction with
preservation of cortical density (presumably from leptomeningeal
vascular collateralization) is not significantly changed.
Infarction of the right caudate nucleus body is also unchanged.
Of note, increased hypodensity of the right cerebral peduncle is
consistent with evolving Wallerian degeneration. Prior left
craniotomy defect and soft tissue scalp hematoma are noted.

Left maxillary and ethmoid air cell mucosal thickening is not
significantly changed.

IMPRESSION: Stable bilateral subdural hemorrhages with no new
intracranial hemorrhage identified. No hydrocephalus or shift of
the normally midline structures.
.
[**2140-11-22**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and
color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 55007**] were performed of the left and right
common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins. In all
of these vessels bilaterally, there is echogenic material
consistent with intraluminal thrombus. There was loss of
compressibility and color flow within all of these vessels. The
superior extent of this cannot be evaluated. No w
