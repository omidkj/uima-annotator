Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1242**]
Chief Complaint:
sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left femoral CVL [**4-13**]

History of Present Illness:
61F with DM1, ESRD on PD, s/p pancreatic transplant, CAD with
[**Month/Year (2) **] [**10-3**] s/p CABG in [**2-3**], p/w rigors and fever to 103.  Pt
reports being n her USOH until she developed diarrhea two nights
ago X 3 BMs, none since.  On the morning of admission she
developed chills that became severe and quickly developed a temp
of 101.  She was sent to the ED.
.
In our ED, Temp was 103.5 at triage. She was noted to have RLE
erythema, warmth and tenderness consistent with cellulitis.  She
was evaluated by transplant surgery who supported diagnosis of
cellulitis and recommended avoidance of central line if
possible.  Renal was also made aware.  Hct 23, lactate 2.2.
Blood culture and peritoneal cultures were sent.  CXR with LLL
opacity worse than prior.  Peritoneal WBC 24 with no left shift.
Patient was started empirically on Vanco/Meropenem/Flagyl for
coverage of cellulitis and posible Cdiff.    During her ED
course systolic blood pressures dropped to 70s despite receiving
3L NS, so she was transferred to the ICU for management of
sepsis. Access 2 PIVs. Vital signs on transfer were: BP 83/36 HR
101 RR 19 O2 sat 100%.
.
Of note patient has history of relative hypotension since her
cardiac surgery with blood pressures usually in the low 100s on
midodrine.  Ocassionally pressures drop to the 70s at her rehab
and quickly improve after small gatorade bolus.  She also has a
history of multidrug resistant organisms including VRE.
.
On the floor, she looks tired, but answering questions
appropriately.  She reports feeling better, still has RLE pain.
.
Review of systems:
as above.
Denies cough, sore throat, abdominal pain, further diarrhea,
blood in stools, change in urinary output, dysuria, any other
skin changes, feeling confused.

.
CXR [**4-12**]:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, improved on the right compared
to the prior
examination, but worsened on the left. Increased opacification
at the left
lung base may represent underlying infection.
2. Low lung volumes with crowding of bronchovascular markings
and minimal
increased pulmonary vascular engorgement.
.
LENI'S [**4-13**]:
TECHNIQUE: Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of right common femoral, superficial
femoral,
deep femoral, popliteal and proximal calf veins were performed.
There is
normal compressibility, flow and augmentation throughout. Mild
subcutaneous
edema is seen in the right calf. Left common femoral vein
waveforms could not
be obtained due to the overlying dresing.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old female with a complicated past medical history
including DMI, on peritoneal HD, s/p pancreas transplant, CHF
who presents with cellulitis of RLE who later developed
enteroccocus sepsis.
.
# enterococcus sepsis: Most likely etiology is RLE cellulitis
given clinical findings on exam.  Blood cultures growing
enterococcus from 1/4 bottles.  She was maintained on pressors
overnight of admission and was eventually weaned off with stable
BPs.  CXR also showed some suggestion of opacification at left
long base so was was covered broadly with meropenem/linezolid to
start, but the linezolid was changed to daptomycin on [**4-13**].
LFTs/CK subsequently increased, so she was changed back to
linezolid. Urine and peritoneal cultures were pending, but no
sign of SBP on cell count.  No diarrhea to suggest c.diff.  She
was put onto stress dose steroids on admission, but was tapered
back to her home dose of prednisone 5mg daily.  Cellulitis was
trended with marked borders and improved. The patient's HD line
was pulled given her bacteremia, and she was switched to PD
Vanc.  The patient also had TTE and TEE, both of which were
negative.
