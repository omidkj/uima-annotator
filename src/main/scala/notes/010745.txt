Brief Hospital Course:
1.SIRS:Sepsis/SIRS presumed result of his LLL PNA (admission
CXR).  Multiple cultures were unrevealing during hospital
course.  Pt had initial lactate of 4.7. This peaked at 6.1 then
trended down.  He was hydrated aggressively. Levofloxacin and
vancomycin were started and continued throughout.  SvO2s were
followed and started in low 40s.  Improved to 60s with
resuscitation. Initially required a bicarb infusion given
worsening acidemia and increasing lactate levels.  This improved
and gtt was stopped.  SvO2 values also improved.  PA catheter
numbers obtained but did not provide clear evidence for sepsis
or pump related failure.

2.PNA/COPD/Resp Failure: Pt treated empirically with levoflox
and vancomycin for PNA.  Attempted mask ventilation to prevent
intubation, but pt became increasingly fatigued with
commensurate worsening of his pH ABGs.  He was therefore
intubated for respiratory failure.  On mechanical ventilation,
he required a fair amt of support.  After initial improvement,
he remained dependent on mechanical ventilation despite multiple
weaning attempts.  Inability to wean presumed secondary to a
number of factors including underlying lung disease with
superimposed pneumonia and a component of failure.  Agitation
and sedation requirements also played a role. Levo was changed
to cefepime for pseudomonal coverage given continued need for
mechanical ventilation with persistent secretions.

3.COPD:Pt was started on dexamethasone for COPD and possible
adrenal insuff given on chronic steroids.  A cortisol level
returned very elevated at >100 though, and the steroids were
weaned down.

4.CV:Pt had h/o cardiac issues.  Unclear cardiac output
initially.  He had TTE that was c/w nL LVEF and RV failure. [**1-23**]+
MR.  Milrinone gtt was started. Also had hydralazine and nitro
gtt as his BP would tolerate to attempt afterload reduction.
Soon though, he became relatively hypotensive, so all BP
lowering medds had to be held. Milrinone continued.  Believe he
needed diuresis, but unable to provide given low BP and poor CO.
Pt also in AF while here, and BB was good at controlling rate.
Rate did increase when this had to be held sec to low BP.  This
worsened his DD.
  With persistent low BPs, phenylephrine was added in addition
to IVF boluses to maintain adequate blood pressure.  This was
difficult to wean off, but did eventually we were able to wean
it off while still maintaining adequate BPs.

Picture had become unclear as to whether pt needed diuresis or
what his CO was, so PA catheter was placed.  As noted above, CO
was in nL range and SVR/PCWP were close to nL even off pressors
so not consistent with either sepsis or cardiac failure.

5.ARF on chronic RF:  Initial creatinine above his baseline
almost normalized with hydration.  Believe problem was poor
perfusion of kidneys in setting of hypotension.  UOP was very
poor and Cr rose for several days, but this process then
reversed, and his renal function markers returned to [**Location 213**]
function and had good urine output.

6.FEN:Tube feeds were started for nutrition and poorly
tolerated.  Did tolerate slightly better close to the end of his
life, but never very successful with this.

6.HTN/hypotension:As above, pt was hypertensive initially.
Placed on hydral and nitro gtt, as well as low dose BB.

7.Neuro:Had head CT done whcih showed old lacunar infarcts.
Nothing new to explain decreased consciousness.

8.Summary:As pt was not improving and had failed multiple
attempts at weaning, ongoing family discussions were held
regarding his wishes.  Pt had expressed desire to be intubated
only for short time if we had reversible cause of illness, but
no more.  He had been intubated for >1 week with no clear
endpoint or easily reversible process.  He remained ventilator
dependent and would face an course fraught with risk of setback
as well as procedures such as a trache and lengthy rehab.  Given
the continued nature of his illness without clear evidence of an
immediately reversible cause, the family felt further aggressive
care was not consistent with Mr. [**Known lastname 30613**] previously expressed
wishes.   The family asked to make Mr. [**Known lastname 1356**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3225**].  The
ventilator was disconnect vent once the family was all present.
The pt died several hrs after vent was turned off.  He was kept
comfortable throughtout.
