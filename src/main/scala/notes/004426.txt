Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
88 yo F with h/o alzheimer's dementia, HTN, and DM2 transferred
from OSH for evaluation by neuro out of concern for ICH.  She
was found in her bed today at NH diaphoretic, somnolent,
lethargic, dysarthric and hypoxic to 80% on 3L NC at which time
she was transferred to Good Samiritan ED for further evaluation.
 She underwent head CT at OSH ED which revealed ? of basal
ganglia bleed.  She was then intubated for increasing
unresponsiveness (only to painful stimuli) and for airway
protection in setting of ? head bleed for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Prior to intubation, she received lidocaine 100mg, etomidate
20mg, succinylcholine 100mg and cerebyx 1gm.
.
En route, she was hypotensive, initially 94/60 -> 64/31 at
9:50am.  This came up with IVF to 97/69, but fell again to 83/44
and thus neosynephrine was started.
.
In the ED here, initial vitals were T: none recorded BP: 111/72
HR: 76  RR: 14  O2 sat: 100% on AC (settings unclear).  She was
continued on neosynephrine for SBPs in the 70s and had only
received 600cc IVFs prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  Here, she
received 2L IVFs in the ED and SBPs improved to 100s-110s off
pressors.  UA was positive for >50 WBCs and many bacteria (no
squams) and she received levofloxacin 750mg IV x1.  CXR was
negative for infiltrate.  She received 1mg ativan prior to
neurology consult. Per RNs, she was moving all extremities, with
good strength in both arms, prior to the ativan (received 1mg IV
x2).  On review of OSH head CT, neurology felt that basal
ganglia finding was more consistent with calcification as
opposed to bleed and recommended repeat imaging here.  Repeat
imaging showed no evidence of acute intracranial process on
NCHCT and CTA head and neck.
.
ROS:  Unable to obtain given patient intubated.

Physical Exam:
98.6  92/43  67  14  100%  AC 450x14  PEEP 5  FiO2 0.5
GEN: Intubated, non on sedating meds however unresponsive.
HEENT: Pinpoint pupils nonreactive to light, symmetric,
conjuctival injection, anicteric, OP clear, dry MM, Neck supple,
no LAD
CV: RRR, distant HS,  no m/r/g appreciated

ABD: soft, ND, + BS, no HSM appreciated
EXT: cool b/l however palpable peripheral pulses including DP/PT
NEURO: Rarely moves both lower extremities minimally.  Does not
follow commands.


Pertinent Results:
[**2147-6-16**] CXR (from OSH):  Increase of right basal lung markings
possibly representing a small infiltrate.  Otherwise relatively
clear lungs.  Chronic changes.
.
[**2147-6-16**] head CT (from OSH)--no official report:  Per transfer
notes, ? basal ganglia bleed.
.
[**2147-6-16**] CXR:  Adequate position of ET and NG tubes. No acute
intrathoracic process.
.
[**2147-6-16**] CTA head/neck:
1. Findings consistent with internal globus pallidus
calcifications bilaterally. No evidence of acute intracranial
process on non contrast head CT.
2. CTA shows moderate internal carotid artery stenosis


Brief Hospital Course:
88yo F with h/o CAD, recurrent UTIs, DM2, alzheimer's dementia
presents with altered mental status and sepsis. The following
issues were investigated during this hospitalization:
.
# Sepsis/Hypotension/Respiratory Failure: Resolved hypotension
and was probably mostly due to hypovolemia on presentation. Did
meet criteria for sepsis given WBC count and tachycardia (at
OSH) with source of infection, clearly positive UA (culture sent
on second sample after received abx and was negative) and had
blossomed pneumonia on CXR. CSF seemed like an unlikely source,
particularly for bacterial meningitis. However, patient was
treated for HSV encephalitis with Acyclovir given RBCs in CSF.
This was later discontinued once cultures came back negative.
Sputum eventually grew MRSA which was treated with Vancomycin
and a 14 day course was completed on discharge. Given a sudden
decline in clinical status and increased sputum production,
Cefepime was also added for possible hospital acquired PNA and
was completed on the day of discharge. Patient was difficult to
wean from the vent given copious secretions which were not
controlled even with Scopolamine and frequent suctioning. For
this reason, a trach was pursued after one failed extubation.
.
# Altered mental status: Most likely due to metabolic insult of
infection (pneumonia/UTI) on already demented baseline. Improved
markedly with lightening of sedation. Initial OSH CT head
concerning for basal ganglia bleed for which she was transferred
however review of that imaging and repeat imaging here negative
for bleed. Initially covered for bacterial and viral
meningitis/encephalitis with ctx/vanco/amp/acyclovir however CSF
cultures negative and by counts on CSF unlikely bacterial.
Again, HSV cultures were eventually negative and empiric
meningitis regimen was discontinued. Patient was otherwise
continued on her dementia medications and upon discharge, was
awake and communicative at her baseline.
.
# CAD: No acute issues
.
# DM: Maintained on Insulin sliding scale

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen and evaluated for respiratory failure, which was
felt to be due to pneumonia. You have received treatment for
this pneumonia, however, it was difficult to remove the
breathing tube that you needed while you were treated. For this
reason, we performed a tracheostomy to assist with your
breathing. Since you cannot eat with this tracheostomy in place,
you also had a gastric feeding tube placed in your stomach. You
are now being discharged to a rehabilitation facility where you
will continue to be treated.

Followup Instructions:
You will be followed by physicians at your rehabliitation
