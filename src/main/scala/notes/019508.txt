Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress
.
Reason for MICU transfer: Critical tracheal stenosis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy
Rigid Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
39 yo WF with a hx of CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG in [**7-10**] complicated
by cardiogenic shock requiring IABP, LV systolic dysfunction (EF
35%), HTN, HLD, DM who presented with to an OSH 3 days ago with
dyspnea and was intubated and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.
.
Her respiratory problems date back to her hospitalization for
her CABG on [**2200-7-8**], after which she was intubated for 7 days for
cardiogenic shock, successfully extubated and discharged on
[**7-19**].  However, she re-presented to an OSH on [**7-21**] with chest
pain and dyspnea and was found to have MRSA PNA and was treated
with Vanc/Moxi. During that hospitalization, she was also noted
to have upper airway stridor and hoarseness [**1-1**] tracheal
stenosis found on CT-Chest that was treated with steroids and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-31**]. During that hospitalization, the
patient had a rigid bronchoscopy which revealed mucoid
concretions that were obstructing the tracheal lumen and given a
presumptive diagnosis of tracheitis. Tissue culture grew out
corynebactrium however BALs were negative. She was covered
empirically with vancomycin, clindamycin, and aztreonam, as well
as micafungin for possible fungal infection and Bactrim for PCP
prophylaxis given her course of steroids. Post-bronch, her
breathing was unlabored with no evidence of inspiratory stridor
or hypoxia. CT-chest also demonstrated LAD thought to be
secondary to her infection. She was subsequently discharged home
on [**2200-8-8**].
.
Most recently, she presented to an OSH three days ago with
worsening dyspnea was intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Here,
she had another rigid bronchoscopy that revealed tracheal
stenosis with friable/necrotic tracheal mucosa obstructing ~80%
of her tracheal lumen that was subsequently removed.  She
ultimately underwent tracheostomy and was admitted to the MICU.
CT-Chest revealed a small amount of mediastinal air thought to
be iatrogenic, LAD which was increased in size from prior, and
diffuse ground glass opacities consistent with aspiration. She
was started on vanc+cipro on [**8-16**] for recurrent tracheitis and
clinda was added on [**8-17**]. She had also been diuresed ~1.5L while
in the MICU. Prior to transfer, ID recommended discontinuation
of Vanc and Cipro and continuation of IV clindamycin for 10
days.
.
Prior to transfer, the patient states that she is still short of
breath, unable to take deep breaths, but feels better than when
she came in.  She also describes a periodic cough productive of
small amounts of green-yellow sputum.  She continues to have
pain over both her tracheostomy site and her sternotomy site.
She denies any fevers, chills, abdominal pain, or change in her
bowel habits.

Imaging
1. New tracheostomy with air visualized in the soft tissue
spaces of the neck and tracking down to the mediastinum. No CT
evidence of tracheal perforation or mucosal tear (trachea above
the tube is opacified with secretions and this section is not
fully assessed) These findings are likely post-procedural.
However, correlation with physical exam and continued clinical
monitoring is recommended.
2. Extensive bilateral opacities with bilateral ground-glass
opacities with sparing of the periphery and more focal
parenchymal opacities at bilateral bases. These findings are
concerning for edema overlying aspiration pneumonia. Edema may
be cardiogenic or noncardiogenic and an early ARDS picture
cannot be excluded.
3. Nodal mass at the level of the right bronchus intermedius
extending to the level of the takeoff of the superior segment of
the right lower lobe superior segment bronchus appears more
prominent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization: This is a 39 year old female
with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2200-7-8**] complicated by cardiogenic shock
with IABP, EF 30%, possible Dressler's syndrome, pneumonia, and
recent admission for tracheal stenosis who was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for management of respiratory failure in the setting of
tracheal stenosis.
.
Active Issues:
.
#. Respiratory Failure: Presented to an OSH with dyspnea and was
intubated and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
In the ED, her ETT appeared to be obstructed, Anesthesia was
emergently consulted, and ultimately she went to the OR with IP
?????? rigid bronch was performed which revealed tracheal stenosis
with friable tracheal mucosa for which she underwent cryotherapy
and forceps removal of the necrotic-appearing respiratory
mucosa; she ultimately underwent a tracheostomy with a long tube
[**Last Name (un) 295**] (terminating ~2cm above the carina). She was admitted to
the MICU for further evaluation. She was able to be weaned off
positive pressure ventilation down to 40% FIO2 with trach mask.
She was then able to be transitioned to the floor and continued
to improve with regards to her oxygen requirement. She was
weaned to a high flow trach mask and was cleared by PT to go
home. She was taught how to manage her trach by respiratory
therapy and demonstrated an understanding of how to manage her
secretions. Case management was able to coordinate the
appro
