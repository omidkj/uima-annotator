Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62 year man with coronary artery disease status 6
vessel CABG [**2153-12-7**] that was complicated by stroke (on
anticoagulation), CHF (EF 25%), pneumonia and  respiratory
failure. He is status post tracheostomy placement.  He was
readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with tachypnea from a rehabilitation
facilty.  Initial differential was chiefly CHF vs. PNA. PE
appeared less likely as INR therapeutic.  Of note the patient
had a recent pna with coag + staph, with hypoxia, tachypnea,
increased wbc. There was concern that he acquired noscomial
pneumonia.  His presentation over the next few days appeared
more consistent with a CHF exacerbation rather than a pneumonia
so the chief goal was to optimize his volume status.  A
cardiology consult was called to assist in this process.
Repeat echo revealed
EF of 40%, and a small loculated pericardial effusion, no sign
of tamponade.  The patient was started on aldactone and diuresed
aggressively with furosemide.  He had lost 7 kg in weight by
time of discharge and was negative 9L.  His lisinopril and
Toprol doses were adjusted for low BP; he was continued on
minimal doses for secondary prevention of CHF.  He will have a
repeat echocardiogram and then follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] in
cardiology at [**Hospital1 18**] upon discharge.  He should see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**]
one week after discharge.  Additionally, he remained in normal
sinus rhythm.  Amiodarone was discontinued.  His INR was
supratherapeutic on discharge at 4.0.  Coumadin was held for the
two days prior ot discharge, and INR trending down.  Plan to
resume warfarin 2mg qHS when INR <3.
.
His respiratory status remained relatively stable on admission,
requiring only intermittent pressure support through the
tracheostomy.  He soon was maintain good saturation on 40% trach
mask.  His tracheostomy was closed with a "trach button" and he
continued to saturate well on 2L nasal cannula.  On [**2154-1-13**] his
trach was decannulated.  He is tolerating this well at the time
of discharge and continues to oxygenate well on 2Lnc.
.
In summary, this is a 62 year old gentleman with CHF (EF now
40%), CAD s/p recent CABG complicated by respiratory failure
requiring tracheostomy and complicated by CVA on
anticoagulation.  He was admitted for tachypnea/respiratory
distress likely secondary to CHF exacerbation.  Currently with
good respiratory status after diuresis and optimization of heart
failure medications.  Also in the process of gettting
tracheostomy reversed.  He is being transferred to
rehabilitation hospital at this time.
