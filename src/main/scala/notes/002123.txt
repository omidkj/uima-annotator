History of Present Illness:
Pt is 85 y/o F with h/o Crohn's disease, right hemicolectomy in
[**2095**] for colon cancer, CAD, afib who presents with abd pain
concerning for ischemic bowel.  Pt initially presented to OSH
one week ago with complaints of chest pain and was ruled out for
MI. Pt developed some RUQ abd pain a few days into her
admission, but her abd pain acutely worsened 2 days ago and was
associated with nausea and vomiting.  Her abdomen was also noted
to be tympanitic.  She had a NG tube placed for her symptoms,
which was subsequently pulled.  KUB initially was nonspecific.
She had a repeat KUB yesterday which showed some dilated small
bowel loops and WBC count increased to 25 with 26% bands.  On
admission it was noted that her Cr had increased to 3.4 and
urine output decreased.  Her abd pain continued to worsen and pt
was noted to have severe tenderness on right side on exam with
rebound tenderness and guarding.  NGT was placed again today
with 1 liter output.  Pt was ordered for CT scan but apparently
pt refused study because of claustrophobia.  For concern for
need for operation, pt was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47639**] was admitted on [**1-6**] to the ICU for managment of
abdominal pain which was concerning for ischemic bowel.  Due to
claustrophobia, patient was unable to undergo CT scan, however
her exam and history were highly concerning for ischemic bowel
and after discussion with the patient and family, it was decided
to go ahead with surgery.  She underwent an exploratory
laparotomy and lysis of adhesions on the day of admission, and
at that time she was found to have an incarcerated Spigelian
hernia with necrotic small bowel.  The necrotic bowel was
resected and patient was managed postoperatively in the ICU.
Initially she required ventilatory support and low-dose
levophed.  She was treated empirically with vancomycin and zosyn
peri-operatively.  Creatinine was elevated to 4 perioperatively
but decreased with IV fluids.

On [**2105-1-8**], patient was extubated and out of bed to a chair.
Her WBC count was 12 and she was afebrile.  She was in atrial
fibrillation but rate controlled.

On [**2105-1-9**], she was transferred from the ICU to the floor and
TPN was started.

On [**2105-1-10**], she conitinued to auto-diurese.  Her pulse oximetry
decreased to 88% on room air and she was re-started on 2L O2 by
NC.  She complained of left-sided chest pain, similar to the
type she has at home for which she normally takes SL
nitroglycerin.  She was given SL nitro x2 and refused IV
morphine, stating her pain was better.  EKG showed Afib, CXR
showed no acute change, and cardiac enzymes were negative x3
over the next 24 hours.

On [**2105-1-11**], she was re-started on her home pain medications and
the O2 was weaned succesfully to room air.

On [**2105-1-12**], a picc line was placed for continued TPN, patient
reported passing flatus, and diet was started on clears and
advanced to regular diet.

On [**2105-1-13**], patient was tolerating a regular diet.  Her
abdominal incision was noted to be mildly erythematous, and she
was started on cipro and flagyl empirically.

On [**2105-1-14**], patient was doing well, out of bed to chair.  TPN
was discontinued in the morning and she was screened for rehab.
The incisional erythema was stable/decreased from the previous
day, and the inferior aspect of the wound was opened [**3-9**]
centimeters and a small amount of serosanguinous fluid was
expressed and sent for culture.

On [**2105-1-15**], patient's blood sugars stable overnight off of TPN
for 24hrs. Surgical status continues to be stable. Abdominal
incision continues with Moist saline packing with decreased
erythema. Contact Dr.[**Name2 (NI) 12822**] office with concerns regarding
incision. She will continue with PO Cipro/Flagyl for another 8
days. PO intake has been adequate. Continue to monitor PO intake
at Rehab.
