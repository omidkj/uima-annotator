[**2115-9-20**] GIB study
INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous
red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic
images of the abdomen for minutes were obtained. A left lateral
view of the pelvis was also obtained.

Blood flow images show a small active bleed in the right lower
quadrant.

Dynamic blood pool images show a small active bleed in the right
hepatic flexure

IMPRESSION: Small active right hepatic fexture gastrointestinal
bleed.

[**2115-9-20**] mesenteric angiography
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After the risks, benefits and
alternatives of the
proposed procedure were thoroughly explained to the patient,
informed consent
was obtained. The patient was taken to the angiography suite and
placed
supine on the imaging table. The right groin was prepped and
draped in the
usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure timeout was performed.
After local
anesthesia with 10 mL of 1% lidocaine, access was gained into
the right common
femoral artery with a 19-gauge needle. A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] guide
wire was
advanced through the needle into the abdominal aorta. The needle
was removed
and a 5 French sheath was inserted. The sheath was connected to
a continuous
side arm flush. A 5 French C2 catheter was then placed through
the sheath
over the wire into the right common femoral artery with the tip
ending in the
abdominal aorta. The [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire was then removed. The C2
catheter was
lodged into the superior mesenteric artery. Arteriogram of the
superior
mesenteric artery taken in multiple projections was recorded
digitally and
showed no active bleeding site or vascular abnormalities
involving branches of
the ileocolic, right colic or middle colic arteries. The [**Last Name (un) 7648**]
wire was
then placed through the C2 catheter and the catheter was then
removed over the
wire. A 5 French SOS catheter was then placed over the wire into
the right
common femoral artery and further advanced into the aorta and
formed in the
thoracic aorta. The wire was then removed. The SOS catheter was
then used to
selectively catheterize the inferior mesenteric artery.
Arteriogram of the
inferior mesenteric artery did not show any active bleeding site
or other
vascular abnormalities at the branches of the left colic artery,
sigmoid
branches, and superior rectal arteries. The C2 catheter was then
removed. The
sheath at the right groin was removed and hemostasis was
achieved by manual
compression of the right groin site for 15 minutes. A sterile
dressing was
applied.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
immediate
complications.

IMPRESSION: Mesenteric arteriogram of the SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] did not
show any active
bleeding or vascular abnormalities. If the patient continues
lower GI
bleeding, a repeat superselective arteriogram of the ileocolic
and right colic
and middle colic arteries could be repeated with possible
transcatheter
embolization.

[**2115-9-24**] CXR
FINDINGS: In comparison to the previous chest radiograph of
[**2115-8-20**],
the multifocal pneumonia has almost completely resolved with
subtle residual
airspace opacities in the right lower lung. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette
is normal and unchanged. Calcification in the thoracic aorta is
stable,
degenerative changes throughout the thoracic spine are moderate
to severe.

IMPRESSION:

Resolving multifocal infection with persistent subtle airspace
opacities in
the right lower lobe


Brief Hospital Course:
82yo M with h/o Afib on Coumadin, dCHF, CRI, and s/p recent EGD
on [**2115-9-11**] showing erosive gastritis with some coffee grounds,
polypectomy of 2 polyps at hepatic flexure, and diverticulosis
in sigmoid colon, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with significant amount of
bleeding per GI tract. Was admitted to unit and resuscitated
with blood products, 9U PRBC's and 4U FFP, and s/p tagged RBC
scan showing bleeding at hepatic flexure (at site of previous GI
procedure), unsuccessful angiography, and s/p repeat colonscopy
with clips applied to ulcers seen at hepatic flexure.

1. GIB--Pt went to unit and resuscitated with blood products,
tagged RBC scan showed bleeding at sight of hepatic flexure.  Pt
went to IR (after prophylactic Bicarb and Mucomyst) for
angiography but no vessel was found for coiling.  By morning
bleeding had stopped entirely and he went for colonoscopy which
showed two deep ulcers around the site of polypectomy from his
prior colonoscopy.  Five clips were placed.  Another polyp was
also discovered during the colonoscopy, but clipping was held in
the setting of acute GI bleed.

Serial Hct's initially showing some drop which required
transfusion of one more U PRBC's which were stopped early due to
low grade fever as below. However, pt's vitals stable through
continued stay on the floor and Hct finally stabilized and was
stable around 28 by the time of d/c.

Coumadin was held on first admission and continued to be held
while pt was admitted. This will need to be addressed at further
visits with PCP as pt has high risk for stroke
