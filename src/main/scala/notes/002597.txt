Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension s/p surgical ASD closure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ASD repair [**2135-2-3**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47091**] is a 74 yo F with h/o AF, IPF (on 4L home O2),
cardiomyopathy with EF 35%, and diabetes who was admitted today
for ASD closure with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**]. Plan was for her to be admitted
to the NP service post-procedure, repeat echo tomorrow AM and
discharge home. ASD closure was successful, but during the
procedure patient became bradycardic to 40s and hypotensive to
70s systolic. Received 500cc IVF with little improvement. She
was then was started on dopamine and neosynephrine gtt (now
weaned to only dopamine), and bolused with atropine 0.5mg IV x2.
In the PACU she was given another 1L IVF with little hemodynamic
improvement. Of note, midazolam, fentanyl, rocuronium and
etomidate were used for sedation and paralysis during the case.
Patient is now being admitted to the CCU for pressors and
monitoring overnight.
.
During ASD closure, patient was noted to have left to right
shunting at the level of the left brachiocephalic artery. She
was also found to have right to left shunting at the level of
the right atrium, causing hypoxemia (see below for blood
oximetry data). Filling pressures were found to be WNL: RAmean
9, RVEDP 8, PAP 54/24, PCWP 11. Ratio of pulmonary blood flow to
systemic blood flow (Qp/Qs) was 1.4. ASD was successfully
closed. Given her h/o IPF and right heart failure, selective
catheter placement in each of the 4 pulmonary arteries was
performed and angiography demonstrated no stenosis. Plan is for
patient to start ASA and Warfarin anticoagulation and f/u with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] in 1 month.
.
Patient has h/o cardiomyopathy with EF 35% and IPF diagnosed in
[**2131**]. Over the past 6 months she has become progressively more
short of breath, now becoming extremely dyspneic on minimal
exertion (e.g. walking to bathroom). She is on 2-4L O2 per NC at
home, normally satting in high 70s to low 80s on room air and
low 90s on 4L O2.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient is hemodynamically stable (SBP
110s, HR 60s), satting 88-93% on 4L. She is awake and responding
to questions. Denies pain, dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations,
nausea, leg pain.


Past Medical History:
1. Atrial fibrillation, currently rate controlled with Toprol-XL
and Warfarin for thromboembolic prophylaxis.
2. Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis on 2L (4 liters with
exertion) home O2 initiated spring of [**2133**] only at night and
requiring oxygen around the clock at present.
3. Hospitalization last year for decompensated heart failure.
4. Cardiomyopathy, most recent LVEF of 35% in addition to RV
dysfunction and severe TR on a recent echo. NYHA III-IV.
5. Secundum ASD noted on recent echocardiogram with
left-to-right shunting.
6. Diabetes.
7. Chronic right hip pain due to hip fracture requiring the use
of a
crutch for ambulation.
8.  Tonsillectomy

TTE [**2135-2-3**]:
Pre-device deployment: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). A patent foramen ovale
is present. A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at rest. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The right ventricular free
wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Severe
[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results at time of procedure.

TTE [**2135-2-4**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. A septal occluder device is seen across the
interatrial septum. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47091**] is a 74 yo F with h/o AF, secundum ASD, IPF (on
4L home O2), cardiomyopathy with EF 35%, and diabetes who was
admitted today for ASD closure, procedure c/b bradycardia and
hypotension.
.
#.HYPOXEMIA: Ms. [**Known lastname 47091**] was satting 88-93% on 4L O2 per NC
on arrival to CCU. With her end stage IPF, she reports home O2
sats of high 70s-low 80s on room air, and 90-94% on her usual
4L. CXR inconsistent with fluid overload. Worsening of PAH may
also be contributing to worsening hypoxemia/dyspnea. On the
floor, she would desaturate to the 70s on 4L NC with ambulation.
With preoxygenation with 100% NRB prior to and with ambulation,
these desaturations were avoided. Per most recent pulm notes,
her pulmonary and overall functional status has significantly
worsened over the past 6 months, now with dyspnea on minimal
exertion and requiring 4L home O2 at all times. Unfortunately
there is no effective
