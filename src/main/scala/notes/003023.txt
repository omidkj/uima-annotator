History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6692**] is a 64 year old female who recently underwent a
bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement and Maze procedure on
[**2122-12-31**]. Her hospital course was rather uneventful and she was
discharged on postoperative day seven. She re-presented with
multiple vague complaints including RUQ abdominal pain and right
flank pain. The pain was described as dull and was rated a [**6-29**].
Patient also  admitted to some nausea and vomiting which was
associated with some fevers, and chills. She denied rigors,
weight loss/gain, bleeding and change in bowel habits. She did
describe her urine as a dark, amber color. Initial evaluation
was notable for elevated LFT's, elevated BNP, elevated white
count, supratherapeutic INR along with a slight increase in
creatinine. She was therefore admitted for further evaluation
and treatment.

[**2123-1-8**] RUQ Ultrasound: 1. Normal gallbladder and liver, with
no evidence of cholecystitis or gallstones. 2. Right-sided
pleural effusion.
[**2123-1-9**] HIDA Scan: Images show prompt uptake of tracer into the
hepatic parenchyma. No tracer activity is seen during this time
within the gallbladder, biliary tree, or GI tract. The above
findings are consistent with cholestasis.
[**2123-1-9**] Abdominal MR: 1. Limited study secondary to motion
artifact from patient's breathing throughout the examination. 2.
Cholangitis involving the left lobe of the liver, better
visualized on recent CT. No focal fluid collections identified
within the liver. 3. Dilated side branch within the tail of the
pancreas likely representing side branch IPMT.
[**2123-1-9**] Abdominal CT Scan: 1. Multiple enhancing tubular and
rounded hypodensities within the left hepatic lobe, likely
representing microabscesses with reactive cholangitis.
[**2123-1-9**] Transthoracic ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small pericardial effusion which is most prominent posterior to
the atria.
[**2123-1-11**] RUQ Ultrasound: There is no biliary dilatation
identified, but there is pneumobilia seen throughout the liver.
The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. Flow is
identified in the right hepatic vein, middle hepatic vein and
the left hepatic vein. There is no ascites identified. There is
a right pleural effusion seen.
[**2123-1-14**] Renal Ultrasound: The right kidney measures 12.1 cm,
and demonstrates diffusely increased echogenicity. A tiny
subcentimeter cyst is identified in the interpolar region. There
is no evidence of stone, mass or hydronephrosis. The left kidney
measures 13.2 cm. There is no evidence of stone, mass, or
hydronephrosis.

ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)

Reason: evaluate for ascites

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old woman with elevated LFTs s/p MVR and MAZE
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for ascites
STUDY: Abdominal ultrasound.

INDICATION: 64-year-old female presenting with elevated LFTs.
Status post MVR and MAZE procedure.

COMPARISONS: MRCP dated [**2123-1-9**] and CT dated [**2123-1-9**].

FINDINGS: Multiple hypoechoic foci present within the left lobe
of the liver are consistent in appearance with small abscesses
and appear unchanged compared to the recent CT and MR
evaluations. These hypoechoic foci appear solid. The right lobe
of the liver appears normal in echotexture. There is prominent
pneumobilia which is new compared to the previous examinations
and consistent with the recent history of ERCP and common bile
duct stent placement. A stent is visualized within the common
bile duct which measures approximately 6 mm in diameter. There
is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. The
gallbladder wall appears mildly thickened. There is no
pericholecystic fluid or wall edema and overall the gallbladder
is not distended. Note is made of prominent sludge within the
gallbladder. A small amount of perihepatic free fluid is noted.
There are bilateral small pleural effusions. The spleen is
prominent in size measuring 12.5 cm in length. Images of the
head and body of the pancreas are unremarkable. The pancreatic
duct is not distended. The main portal vein is patent with
appropriate direction of flow.

IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple hypoechoic foci within the left lobe of the liver
consistent in appearance with small abscesses. All foci appear
solid and non-drainable.

2. Pneumobilia and common bile duct stent placement are new
compared to CT and MRI of [**2123-1-9**].

3. Tiny amount of abdominal ascites.

4. Bilateral small pleural effusions.

5. Gallbladder sludge.
