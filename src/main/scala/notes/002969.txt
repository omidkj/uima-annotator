SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives a [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay nursing
facility.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed a
temperature of 96 degrees Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was
101/61, his heart rate was 66, his respiratory rate was 14,
and he was saturating 98% on 2 liters of nasal cannula.  The
patient was alert and oriented to self only, which apparently
is his baseline.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed a right forehead laceration.  The pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light.  The tympanic
membranes were clear bilaterally.  The oropharynx was clear.
The neck was in cervical collar.  The tongue was midline.
Pulmonary examination revealed the lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed the patient had a regular rate and rhythm.  The
abdomen was protuberant but soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  He had full range of motion of all
extremities.  The extremities were nontender, and no
deformities.  He was guaiac-negative with normal rectal tone.
The back was nontender.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 6.6, his hematocrit was 28.4, and his
platelets were 163.  Sodium was 143, potassium was 4.5,
chloride was 106, bicarbonate was 29, blood urea nitrogen was
51, creatinine was 2, and blood glucose was 108.  The
urinalysis was negative.  The patient had a prothrombin time
of 13.7, his partial thromboplastin time was 35.4, and his
INR was 1.3.  He had a troponin of 0.01.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His electrocardiogram showed no
ST elevations.  He had Q waves in II and III (which were
likely old), and poor R wave progression.

A computed tomography of the head showed a subarachnoid
hemorrhage in the right cistern with an intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.

A computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed a
large right pleural effusion, a small left pleural effusion,
fluid around the liver, gallstones, bilateral renal cysts,
and mass at the prostate.  No acute injuries were found.

A chest x-ray confirmed a right pleural effusion.

A computed tomography of the cervical spine showed slight
widening of the C4-C5 disc space.  The computed tomography
was negative.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit for every 1-hour
neurologic checks and cardiovascular monitoring.  The patient
was started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.

A Neurosurgery consultation was obtained for management of
his intracranial hemorrhages.  A magnetic resonance
imaging/magnetic resonance angiography was obtained which
showed no evidence of aneurysm but confirmed known head
computed tomography intracranial hemorrhages.  The cervical
spine was cleared with a magnetic resonance imaging of the
cervical spine.

Throughout, the patient remained oriented to himself only
(which apparently is his baseline).  The patient had no
neurological deficits during his hospital stay.

Hematuria was noted in the Foley later on hospital day one,
and a Urology consultation was obtained.  Given a negative
CTU, there was low suspicion for trauma etiology.  Discussion
with primary care physician confirmed that this was an
ongoing issue and that the patient already had a urologist
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43569**] who was aware.  Hematocrit reached a nadir of 25,
for which the patient was transfused one unit.  His
hematocrit stabilized at 31, and the patient was to be
discharged with a Foley catheter.

A Cardiology consultation was obtained for the unknown reason
for the patient's fall and observed an erratic heart rate,
alternating between tachycardia and bradycardia.  Per
Cardiology, they thought that he likely developed
supraventricular bradycardia, and his beta blocker was held.
Atenolol was decreased from 25 mg once per day to 12.5 mg
once per day.

An echocardiogram was performed which showed severe mitral
regurgitation with a flail of the anterior leaflet of the
mitral valve.  The patient had an ejection fraction of 35%
and severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall and apex.

Given his multiple medical problems, the patient was not
considered an operative candidate.  The plan was for the
patient to be discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor for
further evaluation of possible dysrhythmias.

A large right pleural effusion was noted on initial Radiology
examinations.  This improved somewhat on subsequent chest
x-rays five days later.  A discussion with the patient's
primary care doctor confirmed that this was an ongoing issue
which she is following.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
 1.  Right subarachnoid hematoma in the sylvian fissure;
which is stable.
 2.  Subdural hematoma in the right midbrain; which is
stable.
 3.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage; which is stable.
 4.  Closed head injury.
 5.  Scalp laceration.
 6.  Right pleural effusion.
 7.  Hematuria.
 8.  C4-C5 disc space widening.
 9.  Coronary artery disease.
10.  Chronic renal insufficiency with left hydronephrosis.
11.  Dementia.
12.  Severe mitral regurgitation with partial flail of
anterior mitral leaflet with an ejection fraction of 35% and
severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall and apex.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (The patient was to resume all of
his regular medications except)
1.  Atenolol 12.5 mg by mouth once per day (versus old dose
of 25 mg once per day).
2.  Discontinue aspirin until [**2156-7-6**].
3.  The patient was to be on Dilantin 150 mg by mouth three
times per day (last dose to be given on [**6-9**]).
