Brief Hospital Course:
58F initially admitted to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] with symptoms of SOB and L
shoulder pain.  Found to be in CHF and Afib, developed a LBBB.
Echo showed EF 55% and basal inferior hypokinesis.  Put on
integrillin and IV heparin and transferred to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Hospital1 **] for
emergent cardiac cath, which showed 3-vessel CAD.

She was taken to the OR [**2135-6-2**] for CABG x3 (LIMA-LAD,
SVG-ramus, SVG-distal RCA).  Post-op, she was transferred to the
CSRU.  She was extubated on POD 0-1.  She developed rapid afib
which had a negative effect on her hemodynamics, with a drop in
her cardiac index and mixed venous oxygen saturations.  Pt. was
started on amiodarone and managed conservatively.  She improved
over the next several days with diuresis with improving pa
catheter numbers and hemodynamics.  She was transferred to the
floor on POD 5.  She was anti-coagulated with coumadin for a
short time, but was taken off after she converted to sinus
rhythm on POD 7, secondary to high fall risk.  She had a brief
transient rise in her creatinine that resolved with decreased
lasix doses.

Neurology commented that the patient has very limited rehab
potential based on atypical dementia and worsening gait
function.
