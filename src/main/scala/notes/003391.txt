Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, jaundice and fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
 72 yo M with DM, A Fib, CAD and CHF admitted with obstructive
cholecytsitis with possible cholangitis s/p ERCP with large
ampullary clot.
.
The patient originally presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital
approximately 1 week prior to admission his current admission.
At that time he presented with jaundice and abdominal pain. He
was found to have elevated LFT's with concern for cholecystitis.
He underwent ERCP at that time with sphincterotomy without
identification of a clear source of obstruction. Per patient
preference, cholecystectomy was delayed for elective removal in
the future. The patient re-presented on [**2178-5-19**] with fevers,
jaundice and abdominal pain. He was noted again to have a
transaminitis to the 200's with T Bili of 5 and leukocytosis to
11.5. Cultures were sent and he was initiated on amp-sulbactam
3g IV q8h. Repeat ERCP on [**2178-5-22**] revealed large blood clot at
the sphincterotomy site as well as periampullary diverticulum.
The patient was transferred for repeat ERCP. He had fevers
overnight and was continued on amp-sulbactam and flagyl. The
patient went for repeat ERCP today where he was found to have a
large clot in the area of his prior sphincterotomy. The clot was
snared (75% of clot removed). He received epinephrine and a
biliary stent was placed. He is transferred to the ICU out of
concern for bleeding and infection risk.

Imaging:

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 72 yo M with DM, A Fib, CAD and CHF admitted with
acute obstructive cholangitis transferred to the MICU s/p ERCP
where he was found to have a large obstructive ampullary clot at
site of prior sphincterotomy and enterococcus bacteremia.

1) Obstructive cholecystitis/cholangitis - Likely due to
obstructive clot at site of recent sphincterotomy.  He had ERCP
on [**5-22**] with removal of the blood clot and placement of a
biliary stent.  Post procedure symptoms now resolved.  He had
remained afebrile with resolving transaminitis.  He was also
found to have enterococcus bacteremia likely [**12-27**] recent
ERCP/sphincterotomy which was likely cause of his fevers.  He
was hypotensive immediately post ERCP but remained
hemodynamically stable overnight.  He had slight drop in his
hematocrit but did not require transfusion or have any evidence
of significant blood loss.
The patient was transferred to the medical floor where he
clinically remained asymptomatic with only only occasional
low-grade fevers on unasyn.
On the afternoon of [**5-25**], the sensitivities on the patient's
[**5-22**] blood cxs growing enterococcus faecium returned revealing
VRE.  The patient's unasyn was discontinued and the patient was
started on linezolid.  He will complete a 14 day course of
linezolid.  His citalopram will be held during that time to
minimize any risk of serotonin syndrome
He will require outpatient cholecystectomy once bacteremia
adequately treated and will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for
stent removal.   His coumadin and aspirin are to be held until
[**2178-5-29**] at which time the patient should resume the medications.

2) VRE bacteremia - likely due to recent ERCP/sphincterotomy and
biliary obstruction.  He was initially treated with unasyn,
flagyl and vancomycin but regimen was tapered to unasyn only on
[**5-24**] once blood cultures returned with enterococcus.  Regimen
changed to linezolid on [**5-25**].

3)Atrial fibrillation - his coumadin and aspirin were held on
admission due to concern for bleeding and possible
re-obstruction of biliary tract.  His metoprolol was initially
held due to hypotension post procedure but was restarted on [**5-24**]
at 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and patient was discharged on home dose.
