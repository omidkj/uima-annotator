History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10528**] is a 65 year old woman with diabetes, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and prior remote left circumflex MI transferred
from OSH to our CCU for evaluation and treatment of CHF
exacerbation. Two weeks ago she was admitted to OSH for
treatment of DKA associated with significant nausea and vomiting
and involving a 5 day ICU stay. On transfer to the floor, her
family states she got lots of IV and PO fluids out of concern
for dehydration and was discharged, by their thoughts,
prematurely. According to her family, she entered the hospital
weighing 160lbs and left weighing 180lbs. When at home she felt
very short of breath and noticed significant lower extremity
swelling. She returned to the hospital 3 days later in what was
assessed as an acute CHF exacerbation.
.
She was initially admitted to the floor and was given IV
furosemide. Cardiac biomarkers were cycled. Her troponin reached
a high of 0.41. Her CK-MB reached a high of 8. Her renal
function gradually climbed from 1.5 -> 2.6. UOP decreased and
started on dobutamine with improved UOP. She also had a few
episodes bradycardia to the 30's which required atropine. This
occured in the setting of using the bedpan. On [**11-26**] she
received two units of pRBC's without any diuretics for a drop in
hematocrit from 25 to 21. There were no obvious areas of
bleeding. She was on [**3-6**] L nasal cannula prior to her transfer.
.
On arrival to the CCU, she was on a non-rebreather. She had been
transferred on a dobutamine and furosemide drip. She had 300 cc
in her foley. She reported her breathing was slightly better
than the past few days.
.
On review of systems, she reports some constipation. She denies
any blood in her stools. She still has episodes of nausea.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2195-11-27**] CXR New right PIC line passes to the mid SVC, where the
tip is partially obscured by a nasogastric tube that is looped
in the stomach and ends at the level of the carina in the
esophagus. Nasogastric tube was removed on subsequent radiograph
available at the time of this dictation, so I made no attempt at
position verification.
Heart is moderately enlarged. Lungs are filled with multiple
nodules and
moderately severe pulmonary edema and/or consolidation. Right
pleural
effusion is small. No pneumothorax or appreciable left pleural
effusion.

[**2195-11-27**] ABDOMEN XRAY AP view of the chest and left decubitus
frontal view of the abdomen show marked fecal impaction of most
of the colon and a nasogastric tube is looped in the stomach
returning to the level of the carina, subsequently removed on
chest radiograph performed on [**2195-11-28**] at 7:50 p.m. and
available at the time of this dictation. The absence of
appreciable distention of bowel proximal to the impacted colon
corroborates an intact ileocecal valve. There may also be a
right femoral or inguinal hernia, without evidence of
incarceration or obstruction.

[**2195-11-28**] CXR Nasogastric tube has been removed. Right PIC line
ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction. Widespread
pulmonary opacification, has worsened appreciably, obscuring the
margins were previously well defined lung nodules.  Pleural
effusions may also have increased and cardiomegaly worsened. No
pneumothorax.

[**2195-11-28**] ABDOMEN US GALLBLADDER OR LIVER The liver echotexture
is coarse. There is no focal intrahepatic lesion or intrahepatic
bile duct dilation. A 5-mm calcified granuloma lies within the
right lobe. The main portal vein is patent, demonstrating proper
hepatopetal flow. The CBD is not dilated, measuring 2 mm. The
gallbladder is normal. No ascites is detected. The spleen is not
enlarged, measuring 8.7 cm. Bilateral pleural effusions are
present.
IMPRESSION:
1. Coarsened liver echotexture, suggestive of underlying liver
disease.
Clinical correlation is recommended and advanced disease such as
cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be excluded with this technique.
2. No intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilation.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions.

[**2195-12-2**] CXR Cardiomegaly is stable. Now mild-to-moderate
pulmonary edema has improved.  There is no evidence of
pneumothorax or increasing pleural effusions. The pleural
effusions are small and bilateral. There are no new lung
abnormalities, lung nodules are not appreciated, and continued
followup is recommended until resolution of acute fin
