History of Present Illness:
79yo M with h/o crohn's colitis on prednisone and asacol, Afib
on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG, PVD who presented to [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital with hematemesis and BRBPR.  On admission labs notable
for INR 7.7.  Initial Hct 21->19.  Pt was transfused total of 8
units pRBC and 6 units FFP with Hct rising to 27 and INR
dropping to 1.3.  Pt remained hemodynamically stable with HR
between 80-120 and SBP greater than 140.  Pt also given
lopressor and solumedrol (for presumed adrenal insufficiency)
and ceftriaxone/Flagyl for possible PNA.  Pt became extremely
agitated requiring ativan and haldol.  EGD revealed nl
esophagus, bright blood in prepyloric region of antrum.  Unable
to identify source of bleed.  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] at
[**Hospital1 18**] where on admission he remained hemodynamically stable with
HR in 90s and BP 170/80.  NG Lavage was performed with 1500cc
water and was clear.  Initial Hct was 26, INR 1.1, platelets 93
and fibrinogen 360.
    Wife reports that pt has been c/o early satiety for past
week with decreased PO intake.  No abd pain or N/V.  Had
increased swelling in L arm over weekend for which he took
alleve.  Saw PCP early last week and U/S reportedly was neg for
DVT.  Pt rx with Celebrex and increase of prednisone to 40mg
with plans to taper.

MRI of neck:
Each of the discs of the level screened, C2-C7 is narrowed and
at
each level there are bilateral disc/osteophyte complexes.
Endplate
degenerative changes are noted, as seen on the plain film from 2
days
previously. There is mild relative stenosis of the left [**Name (NI) 20526**]
foramen. There is moderate C3-4 foraminal stenosis.
At C4-5, there is some indentation of the thecal sac but no
clear flattening of the spinal cord. There is mild to moderate
bilateral foraminal stenosis minimally worse on the left than
the right.
At C5-6, there is fairly severe left foraminal stenosis, as seen
on the plain film. There is mild right foraminal stenosis.
At C6-7, there is also severe left foraminal stenosis from the
disc/osteophyte complex. Mild right foraminal stenosis is seen.
The C7-T1 foramina are well maintained. There is minimal
anterolisthesis of C7 on T1.
The spinal cord is of normal size and signal intensity and there
is no spinal cord compression. The craniovertebral junction is
normal.
IMPRESSION: There is multilevel moderate to severe spondylosis.
There is bony stenosis of multiple foramina, particularly the
left C5-6 and C6-7 foramina. No spinal cord compression is seen.


LEFT SHOULDER MR: There is a moderate-sized joint effusion with
debris within it. Also there is fluid in the subacromial and
subdeltoid bursa. There are complete tears of the supraspinatus
tendon and infraspinatus tendon with retraction of their
respective muscles. Additionally there is high signal within
their respective muscles consistent with atrophy. There is also
high signal within the subscapularis tendon on proton
density-weighted sequence suggestive of a tear. The teres minor
tendon is intact. There is a high riding humeral head. There are
osteophytes on the glenoid and within the AC joint. There is
thinning of both the humeral head and glenoid cartilage. The
biceps tendon is torn, and there is retraction of the tendon.

IMPRESSION:
1. Torn supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and biceps
tendons with atrophy of their associated muscles.
2. Effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  gastrointestinal bleed - Pt was initially admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  The EGD showed that the bleed was likely gastric in
origin, as there was fresh blood in the antrum, but no
particular focus of bleeding source could be identified.  The NG
lavage was clear, and pt remained hemodynamically stable.  Pt's
hematocrit was 25.8 on admission and remained stable after 2
units PRBCs in the 28-30 range.  There was no further evidence
of bleed.  Of note, pt's INR was 1.1 during his hospitalization
(was 7.7 initially at outside hospital, where pt received 8
units PRBC and 6 units FFP).  PPI was given [**Hospital1 **], and pt was sent
out on [**Hospital1 **] PPI for an acute GI bleed.  Coumadin was held for one
week per GI recommendations, as was aspirin for 2 weeks.  Follow
up endoscopy is recommended in 6 months.

2.  atrial fibrillation - pt was noted to have [**11-28**] second pauses
reportedly while on telemetry in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  His BB was stopped
in the context of an acute GI bleed and in the setting of these
pauses, as it was noted that pt has bifascicular block.  When pt
reached the floor, an EP consult was called.  Pt was placed on
telemetry and monitored, and he remained tachycardic in 120s.
It was decided to try to reinstitute beta blocker and monitor on
telemetry for pauses.  The maximum length of pause that was seen
at a dose of BB sufficient for rate control was 1.6 seconds.
Therefore, it was recommended that pt not undergo pacer
placement, and he was sent home on lopressor 50mg po bid for
rate control of atrial fibrillation.  As noted above, coumadin
was held temporarily in setting of acute GI bleed.

3.  coronary artery disease - s/p CABG, with small troponin leak
in setting of GI bleed.  This was thought to be due to demand
ischemia.  Pt did not rule in for an MI.  Aspirin was held, as
was his statin initially; the latter was begun on arrival to the
floor.  ACE inhibitor was begun, as well; pt will require
monitoring as an outpatient to check potassium and renal
function.

4.  acute renal failure - Cr was initially elevated to 2.6 at
outside hospital, trended down to 1.7 with volume resuscitation,
suggesting prerenal azotemia.  Pt's Cr on discharge was at
baseline of 1.4

5.  L arm swelling - the etiology of this was initially unclear.
 Reportedly had a negative UENI recently.  Pt showed both
weakness and pain and could not lift arm above head.  Plain
films were unremarkable, showing mainly some osteoarthritis.
MRI of shoulder showed rotator cuff tear, and MRI of neck showed
cervical spondylosis, which also may have been contributing to
pain.  Results of these MRI studies were printed on patient's
discharge paperwork - will follow up with PCP and may require
consultation with orthopedic surgeon.

6.  agitation - pt has h/o of ICU psychosis, became agitated
while in [**Hospital Unit Name
