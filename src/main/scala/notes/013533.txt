.
[**2110-11-2**]: Ankle xray: There is a displaced comminuted overriding
distal fibular (lateral malleolus) fracture. There is also a
comminuted fracture of the medial and posterior malleolus
(tibial) with likely intra- articular involvement. There is
surrounding soft tissue swelling. The ankle mortise appears
symmetric.
.
[**2110-11-3**]: TTE: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal.
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe mitral
annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
7. Compared with the report of the prior study (images
unavailable for review) of [**2107-2-14**], there is probably no
significant change.
.

[**2110-11-4**]: CT chest (w/o contrast): 1. Multiple small discrete
peripheral pulmonay opacities. The appearance is nonspecific but
could be secondary to pulmonary infarctions from multiple
pulmonary emboli. This could be further evaluated with a chest
CTA. The mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy could also be
better evaluated with intravenous contrast.
2. Mild interstitial edema.
3. Slight over-distension of the endotracheal tube cuff.
.
[**2110-11-16**]: Chest xray: Endotracheal tube, central venous
catheter, and nasogastric tube remain in standard position.
Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. There is persistent
vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness attributed to
congestive heart failure. The peripheral right hemidiaphragm is
partially obscured. This may be due to right effusion and/or
developing consolidation in the right lower lobe. Followup
radiographs are suggested to exclude developing infectious
pneumonia.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:52 year old COPD, CRI, HTN, anemia, p/w ankle fracture and
now intubated for hypercarbic respiratory distress.
.
#Hypercarbic respiratory distress - This is likely exacerbation
of her underlying COPD and CHF with questionable PNA. PCP
reports [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 15 lb weight gain over the last month although no
evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR. PNA is no evidence on CXR,
but there is significant secretion on suctioning as well.
Patient was treated with lasix in attempt to diurese, levaquin
and vancomycin for pna, albuterol, combivent, solumedrol for
COPD. Despite these efforts, patient was extubated
unsuccessfully and required reintubation and had an episode of
asystole. She then was reintubated for one more week. On
extubation, patient was made DNR/DNI and comfort measures were
started with morphine gtt. Patient died the next day [**3-6**]
respiratory failure.
.
.
#Ankle fracture
-comminitated fracture-> put in cast.
.
# CKD- Baseline Cr 1.7 - 2.4, and planned for starting HD at the
end of the year. Cr on admission was 4.1 and BUN 108. Attempted
aggressive diuresis. Creatinine improved down to high 2s.
Dialysis never started.
.

.
# CV
a)Pump: history of CHF. Patient had pulmonary edema on cxr and
had h/o weight gain. Attempted diuresis with bumex and
metalazone which was difficult given CRI.

.
b) ischemia-elevated CK likely in setting of fall and elevated
troponin likely in setting of renal failure. troponin is at
baseline.
-monitor on telemetry
-continue b-blocker and ASA
.
c)rhythmn-NSR w/1 AVB.
.
# HTN: Elevated over baseline likely in setting of stress
-Continued labetalol, nifedipine, bumex, imdur, hydralazine
-held valsartan given very limited renal status
.
# DM type II: FS QID with RISS for now. oral glycemic held in
setting of sulfonrea-related hypoglycemia.
.
# ANEMIA: Stable and at baseline.Will guaiac all stools and
monitor hct daily
.
# DEPRESSION: Continue home regimen of doxepin, carbamazepine
and remeron.
