Service: MED

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Tylenol and Sominex Overdose in Suicide Attempt.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous gastrosostomy tube ([**10-13**]), Tracheostomy ([**10-13**]),
Tunneled Left Subclavian Port (for Hemodialysis). Hemodialysis.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 32 yo male with a past medical hx significant for EtOH
abuse and past suicide attempts who presented on [**2123-9-25**] to an
outside hospital after he was found in a field "rolling around."
 At the site, a receipt for sominex and tylenol were found.  At
the outside hospital, pt reported injestion of the above the
night before.  At the OMH, he had an acute change in mental
status with vomiting and he was intubated for airway protection.
 Tox screen there was +for TCAs (thought to be a false + due to
the Sominex), with tylenol level of 242.  Pt received mucomyst
and charcoal.  LFTs rose to AST 9792, ALT 6063, INR 3.69.  EtOH
level 289.  Rec'd more mucomyst and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
liver transplant evaluation.

EtOH abuse, Depression (past suicide attempt by injestion,
hanging.)

[**2123-9-27**] DOPPLER FINDINGS: The hepatic venous system is patent.
The portal venous system is patent with flow in an appropriate
direction. The main hepatic artery is also patent.IMPRESSION:
1) Perinephric fluid surrounding both kidneys in the perirenal
space. 2) Echogenic renal cortices. This finding is suggestive
of diffuse renal parenchymal disease. 3) Patent hepatic veins
and portal venous system with flow in an appropriate direction.
Normal hepatic parenchymal echogenicity with no evidence of
biliary ductal dilatation.

[**2123-9-28**] CXR:  1) Right IJ central venous line retracted slightly
and is now in satisfactory position. 2) NG tube should be
advanced slightly as the side port still is above the GE
junction. The tip is in the stomach. 3) Bilateral lower lobe
opacities consistent with aspiration.

[**2123-9-28**] ECG: Sinus bradycardia. Minor nonspecific ST-T wave
abnormalities

[**2123-10-7**] CT head: IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of hemorrhage or
acute stroke or mass effect.

[**2123-10-9**]  CT1: Extensive diffuse bilateral parenchymal and
interstitial opacities. Given the patient's history, this likely
represents ARDS vs. congestive heart
failure. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  2. No
intraabdominal source of fever identified. No loculated fluid
collections.  3. Endotracheal tube low-lying above the carina.
This may be partially withdrawn for optimal positioning.

[**2123-10-18**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 15-20%).
The basal
inferior and inferolateral walls contract the best. Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2123-10-18**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Right axis deviation. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2123-10-15**] there are new T wave
inversions in the anterolateral leads - cannot rule out
myocardial ischemia.

[**2123-11-2**] ECG: Sinus rhythm Marked right axis deviation T wave
inversion in leads l, aVL, V3-V6 - consider metabolic
abnormality or ischemia Since previous tracing, sinus
tachycardia absent, and T waves now upright in lead V2

[**2123-11-6**] CXR: Comparison is made to prior portable film dated
[**2123-10-31**]. Previously described tubes and catheters have been
removed. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is
considerable interval improvement in aeration diffusely,
although the lungs are not yet clear, there is no evidence of
pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU after a suicide attempt with
Acetaminophen ingestion.

1) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Upon admission the was lethargic,
confused and in fulminant hepatic failure, with laboratory
studies revealing severe hepatic injury along with a decreaes in
hepatic function. He was seen by Toxicology who recommended NAC
Antidotal therapy. He was seen by the hepatology team who
started a work-up for possible liver transplant. His family was
contact[**Name (NI) **] in [**Name (NI) 4754**] and sister (in [**Name (NI) 86**]) was alerted to the
pt's condition. Social work and psychiatry also evaluated the pt
with conclusion that pt would be a poor social candidate for
transplant given past hx of EtOH abuse, poor self-care, and
limited support. Liver transplant team evaluated the pt and
found him to be a poor transplant candidate given multiple
social stressors and lack of insurance. The initial plan was to
determine his hepatic status and continue to monitor LFTs. Over
his course, his mental status improved (after a waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**]
course), his liver function improved, and his liver enzymes and
liver function nearly normalized by his discharge.

2) Acute Renal Failure: Also early in the pt's course, he
developed worsening renal function along with a metabolic
acidosis. He soon required qod hemodialysis. Over his course, he
regained renal function and began to produce urine at the end of
his course. He was followed by the Renal Team.

3) Respiratory Failure: In conjuction with his ARF, it was
believed that a respiratory compensation for an acute metabolic
acidosis caused his respiratory failure. At the onsent of his
resp distress, a CXR showed a probable aspiration PNA and
Levofloxacin was started. It shall also be noted that an acute
CHF also likely contributed to his failing respiratory status
(see below). The pt was then intubated. His course was
complicated by repeated exacerbations of worsening PNA, and
pulmonary edema. He required emergent HD on several occasions to
address the pulmonary edema. After continuous antibiotics and
CHF support, the patient stabilized and then im
