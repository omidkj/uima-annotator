Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room on [**2192-10-17**] where he underwent a right
thoracotomy and right upper lobe sleeve lobectomy.  He tolerated
the procedure well and returned to the SICU in stable condition.
 He maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was controlled
with an epidural catheter. He underwent vigorous pulmonary
toilet including bronchodilator nebulizers and was gradually
able to wean off oxygen. His chest tubes had an intermittent
leak early on which resolved and there was minimal drainage.
His hematocrit was stable.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he continued to make
good progress.  His epidural catheter was removed on [**2192-10-19**]
and he had adequate pain relief with Oxycodone and scheduled
Tylenol.  He was able to use his incentive spirometer
effectively and was ambulating independently after his chest
tubes were removed. His xray showed a small apical space post
chest tube removal but he remained asymptomatic.  His incision
was dry and healing well and after an uneventful recovery he was
discharged to home on [**2192-10-22**] and will follow up in the Clinic
in 2 weeks.
