CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: evaluate effusion - in HD please check with RN that pt
on fl

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old woman with s/p avr
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion - in HD please check with RN that pt on floor
INDICATION: Followup.

FINDINGS: Comparison to [**2164-12-22**]. The right-sided
sheath in the jugular vein has been removed. All other invasive
and monitoring devices are in unchanged position. The effusions
are small and limited to the very area of the pleural sinuses.
In unchanged manner, the silhouette of the heart is enlarged.
Slight aortic calcification. Subtle signs of fluid overload.

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with signs of fluid overload, unchanged
extent of bilateral pleural effusions.

[**Numeric Identifier **] PICC W/O PORT  [**2164-12-24**] 12:01 PM

Reason: no IV access

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old woman with s/p AVR w/ chronic renal failure, on HD
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
no IV access
PICC LINE PLACEMENT

INDICATION: IV access needed for antibiotics.

The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was
performed.

RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4686**] performed the
procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4686**], the Attending Radiologist, was present
and supervised the entire procedure.

TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the
right brachial vein was punctured under direct ultrasound
guidance using a micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound
images were obtained before and immediately after establishing
intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 35 cm
in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its
tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position
of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the
chest.

The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. The
catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile
dressing applied.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
5 French double-lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial
venous approach. Final internal length is 35 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.
