shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
74y/o F NH resident w/ h/o COPD, CHF, DM2, CRI, was in USOH 2
days PTA when she began to develop fever, productive
cough-yellow sputum, increasing shortness of breath with
decreased sats (85% on 2L increased to 93% on 4L). She was seen
by her PCP who started her on steroids (prednisone 60mg),
levofloxacin 500mg, and nebs for treatemtent of a COPD
exacerbation. Pt was then sent to ED at [**Hospital1 18**]. Here she was
given further nebs in addition to antibiotics/steroids and
admitted to the medicine service. The CXR at time showed
pneumonia and heart failure. On [**2111-4-22**], ICU was called for
worsening shortness of breath despite increasing oxygenation.
*
On arrival to the ICU, the patient was noted to be tachypneic,
with no accessory muscle use. She was lethargic and disoriented
with HR 116, BP 122/60, R 24, T 101. ABG at time was
7.22/91/201 on high flow mask. Patient was then placed on BIPAP,
and within minutes patient became more awake. Repeat ABG after
10min on NIV was 7.23/86/102.

Radiologic Studies:
*
CXR [**4-21**]: Findings consistent with failure which may be slightly
asymmetric. Patchy basilar and retrocardiac opacities making
difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia.
*
LENI [**4-23**]: Negative for DVT
*
ECHO [**4-22**]:
There is moderate symmetric LVH. The LV cavity is unusually
small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. LV systolic function
appears hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The RV cavity is dilated. RV
systolic function appears depressed. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The MV leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no MV prolapse. MR is present but cannot be
quantified. TR is present but cannot be quantified. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion
*
Renal Doppler U/S [**4-23**]:
1) No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2) Technically suboptimal Doppler examination of the kidneys.
Renal artery stenosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this
exam
*
Bronchial Washings [**4-24**]: Negative for malignant cells.
*
CHEST/ABD/PELVIS CT [**4-27**]:
1) Congestive heart failure with likely underlying multifocal
pneumonia; correlate clinically.
2) Cardiomegaly and marked prominence of the main pulmonary
artery, likely consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension.
3) Aortic and coronary artery calcification.
4) Cholelithiasis. Possible gallbladder wall edema, though this
may be artifactual second to non-contrast low-dose technique.
5) No other identifiable cause to explain the patient's severe
abdominal pain and distention.
6) Thoracic kyphosis and degenerative disease of the spine.
*
[**4-28**] RUQ U/S:
1. Cholelithiasis and gallbladder wall edema in a nondistended
gallbladder. This finding is nonspecific in nature and could
represent chronic cholecystitis. Alternatively, this could
represent sequela of hepatitis, pancreatitis, or a low protein
state.
*
[**5-6**] Chest/Abd CT:
1) Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, increased
consolidation within the left lower lobe as well as improved
opacity within both upper lobes. These findings are suggestive
of aspiration pneumonia.

2) Cholelithiasis with no pericholecystic inflammatory change.
No cause for the patient's abdominal pain is identified.

3) Enlargement of the pulmonary artery indicating probable
pulmonary artery hypertension.

4) Collapse of the airways in this patient status post
tracheostomy, a finding raising the question of tracheomalacia.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 74 y/o F with PMH of COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, CRI,
who initially presented with hypoxia secondary to CHF/COPD flare
and likely LLL pneumonia. Her respiratory status worsened and
she was admitted to the ICU on hospital day 2 for hypercarbic
respiratory failure. A brief [**Hospital 11822**] hospital course is
outlined below.

1. Respiratory Failure: She developed worsening dyspnea and was
admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure on
hospital day 2. Her intial ABG was 7.22/91/201 and was not
responsive to BiPap, so she was emergently intubated. Her
respiratory failure was felt multi-factorial from COPD/CHF and
underlying LLL pneumonia (with leukocytosis). While intubated
she was treated with a steroid taper for COPD exacerbation,
diuresed aggressively for CHF, and was treated with a 14 day
course of Zosyn for suspected pneumonia. She had initially
recieved 4 days of Levofloxacin and Vancomycin, but this was
changed to Zosyn on HD 5 for broader coverage of suspected
nosocomial pneumonia (and no history of MRSA). She was extubated
on HD 11. However, she subsequently developed increasing work of
breathing off of the ventilator, and was therefore re-intubated
on HD 14 with plan for trach. Trach was placed on HD 15.
However, she was unable to be weaned from the ventilator despite
continued diuresis and completion of her antibiotic course. She
has a noted history of COPD, but her lung volumes were not felt
to be consistent with this diagnosis, and she did not have PFTs
on record here for further evaluation. Chest CT was also
performed to evaluate for interstitial process and was negative.
NIF was performed and was borderline (-25). Of note, following
completion of her 14 day course of Zosyn, she was also treated
empirically with a 7 day course of vancomycin for empiric
treatment of gram positive cocci in her sputum culture (from
4/31), although final sputum culture showed only oropharyngeal
flora. She did gradually begin to have improved respiratory
status (unclear if related to vancomycin antibiotics or other
un-related factors) with decreasing need for pressure support.
RSBI was noted to be <100 and she was given a
