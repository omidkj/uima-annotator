Dyspnea

None.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71yo male who fell ~20 feet to ground on [**2106-1-18**]
while shoveling snow off a roof, likely sustained single rib fx
and L1 fx at time, and had been doing well until 3 days ago when
he developed SOB with exertion.  About one month ago, pt fell
~20 ft when the ladder he was standing on collapsed around him.
Reports hitting his head at time, with + LOC.  Also reports
ladder folding around his abdomen.  At OSH, had CT head and
C-spine without contrast, which showed no acute intracranial
process and no acute fracture or dislocation of cervical spine.
Had been doing well since that time, with intermittent abdominal
pain but no back pain.  Then about 3 days PTA, began to develop
dyspnea on exertion.  Presented to PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] referred patient for
CT abd/pelvis given concern that patient may have sustained
further injury during recent fall.  Report notes L1 vertebral fx
of indeterminate age, though new since 6/[**2104**].  Patient also
noted to have patchy opacity R lung, c/w possible PNA.  Started
on azithromycin for planned 5 day course. Over the next two
days, developed progressively worsening dyspnea to the point
where he could not walk.  Wife brought him to ED at OSH for
further evaluation.  Denies any CP during this time.
.
At [**Hospital6 19155**] ED, was tachycardic to 120s,
tachypneic in 30s, and hypoxic to 60s on room air.  Sat came up
to 98% on NRB.  ABG on 12L O2 NRB (FiO2 100%): 7.43/39/82/25.9.
WBC 14.5.  Had CTA chest which revealed bilateral segmental and
subsegmental PEs, as well as bilateral lower lobe infarction.
Received heparin bolus, and was started on heparin gtt (guiac
neg).  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible lysis.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient satting well on NRB.  VS: 96.3 120
123/73 34 98% on NRB (10L O2).  Per report lungs clear on exam,
abdomen benign, and lower extremities w/o edema.  PTT
therapeutic at 63.  Had bedside echo which showed RV dilitation,
intraventricular septal bowing.  Given patient hemodynamically
stable, he did not receive lysis. Just prior to transfer to
MICU, VS: 111, 116/69 22 97% on 8L NRB.
.
On arrival to MICU, patient satting in high 90s on NRB, and
quickly weaned to 6L NC with sat maintained in mid-high 90s.
Patient still tachy to 120s.  Reports significant improvement in
SOB with supplemental O2.  Denies any CP at present, though does
have discomfort when coughing.  Intermittent dry cough; no
hemoptysis.
.
ROS: Positive as per HPI.  Also notable for ~10 pound weight
loss over past month, decreased appetite.  Had colonoscopy ~1
year ago with single polyp removed per patient's report.  Felt
warm/diaphoretic last night.  Chronic constipation. Denies any
HA, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/D,
blood in stool, dysuria, myalgias, arthralgias, easy bruising,
bleeding, or rashes.

Past Medical History:
HTN
Hand tremor
HLD
s/p hernia repair
s/p knee surgery

Social History:
Married, lives with wife. [**Name (NI) **] 5 children. Denies any tobacco or
illicit drug use.  Rare EtOH, about one drink every 3 months.

Family History:
Mother may have had history of blood clot. No family history of
bleeding disorders.

IMAGING:
TTE [**2106-2-22**]: IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement
with free wall hypokinesis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mitral valve prolapse with moderate mitral
regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta.
.
LENIs [**2106-2-22**]:
IMPRESSION: Deep vein thrombosis seen in two of the calf veins
of the right leg (one posterior tibial vein and one peroneal
vein). A nonocclusive thrombus is seen in the right popliteal
vein. No DVT seen in the left leg.
.
CT Head w/o Contrast [**2106-1-18**] ([**Hospital6 19155**]): No
acute intracranial process. Soft tissue swelling over high right
parietal convexity.
.
CT C-Spine w/o Contrast [**2106-1-18**] ([**Hospital6 19155**]):
Multilevel degenerative changes, most prominent at levels of
C4-C5 and C5-C6.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**2106-2-19**] ([**Hospital6 19155**]): Compression
deformity involving L1 superior endplate; which is new compared
to [**2105-6-5**], but remains age indeterminate. The frature line
extends into the right pedicle, but not the right pedicle. There
is no retropulsion of bone fragments into the spinal canal.
There is approximately 20% vertebral body height loss. Further
eval with MRI recommended. Patchy opacifications at right lung,
c/w PNA. Small fluid density left pleural effusion, with
compressive atalecatsis. No acute intraabdominal pathology.
.
CTA CHEST (OSH) [**2106-2-21**]: bilateral large pulmonary emboli
.


Brief Hospital Course:
71yo male s/p fall ~1 month ago at which time he likely
sustained rib fracture and L1 fracture, with progressively
worsening dyspnea on extertion over past several days, bilateral
PEs noted on CTA chest at OSH, and evidence of RV strain, who is
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management and possible
lysis.
.
#. Bilateral Submassive PEs: Patient presented with dyspnea,
tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxemia, CTA chest findings of
bilateral PEs, and evidence of RV strain.  Given RV strain,
elevated trop of 0.19, and elevated BNP of 7355, patient at
overall increased mortality risk.  Was hemodynamically stable on
arrival to ICU; there were no indications for urgent/emergent
thrombolysis.  PTT was therapeutic on heparin gtt, and dyspnea
had significantly improved with supplemental oxygen.  Etiology
of PEs unclear, though may be related to recent trauma.
