Service:  Gold surgery service

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76 year-old
male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath.

The patient was discharged home on [**3-22**] status post a Whipple
procedure on [**3-15**].  The patient had an uneventful pylorus
preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with open cholecystectomy
and incidental Meckel's diverticulectomy.  The surgery was
indicated on the basis of a periampullary mass identified on
endoscopy.  Prior to the patient's discharge there was no
indication of an [**Last Name 14344**] problem.  His laboratory
values were acceptable.  He had low output from his [**Doctor Last Name 406**]
drain, and the drain amylase was checked and found to be less
than 3.  There drain was therefore pulled prior to his
discharge.  At home, the patient became ill.  He complained
of weakness and shortness of breath.  However, he denied
fever, vomiting, pain or cough.  He had had no bowel movement
since his discharge ten days prior.

IMPRESSION:  A 76 year-old male, status post Whipple
procedure with uncomplicated postoperative course now with
increasing shortness of breath, decrease in blood pressure
and hematocrit of 23.  Also with apparently worsening renal
failure, possibly secondary to dehydration.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The night of admission the patient's
shortness of breath increased and his saturations decreased
to 90 percent on a nonrebreather with a respiration rate of
40.  The arterial blood gas showed hypoxia but a VK scan was
negative.  The patient was transferred to the unit,
intubated, and ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  The
patient also received two units of packed red blood cells and
hydration.  The following day the patient received two
additional units of packed red blood cells bringing his
hematocrit up to 37.9.  The patient underwent an abdominal CT
which showed free air in the abdomen consistent with an
anastomotic leak.  Some of the free air was noted to be in
the afferent limb of the base of the liver.  Because of the
findings on CT scan the patient was taken to the operating
room where he underwent drainage of an intra-abdominal/
retroperitoneal abscess, control of an early postoperative
pancreatic fistula, placement of gastrostomy tube, and
placement of a feeding jejunostomy tube.  The patient was
found to have dehiscence of the anterior aspect of his
pancreaticojejunostomy and a regional intra-abdominal/
retroperitoneal abscess.  Please see dictated operative note
for further details.  The culture of an intraoperative swab
was later found to be growing enterococcus gram negative
rods, lactobacillus, and presumptive Clostridium perfringens.
Postoperatively the patient was initially placed on broad
spectrum antibiotics consistent with Vancomycin, Levofloxacin
and Flagyl.  Postoperatively the patient exhibited a septic
picture requiring continuing Levophed in order to maintain
his blood pressures.  The patient was also placed on CDBH for
his acute and chronic renal failure and in order to properly
regulate his blood volumes.  The patient was followed closely
by a renal consulting team for his acute and chronic renal
failure.  On postoperative day two the patient experienced
two bouts of rapid atrial fibrillation with hypotension.  The
patient was cardioverted but then returned to rapid atrial
fibrillation.  The patient was then treated with an
amiodarone drip.  The patient's blood pressures then
stabilized at 110/50.  A cardiology consult was obtained for
the new onset rapid atrial fibrillation.  They point out that
atrial fibrillation in the setting of SIRS with Levophed is
not unusual and amiodarone and hemodialysis is the
appropriate action.  Therefore, the amiodarone was continued
along with the DCCV.  By postoperative day three the
patient's Levophed requirement began to decrease.  However,
he was still in refractory atrial fibrillation.  Amiodarone
was therefore continued.  The patient was also begun on
trophic feeding through his J tube.  On postoperative day
five the patient required continuing CVVH, one unit packed
red blood cells for decreasing hematocrit and Levophed
weaning was begun.  An infectious disease consult was
obtained for the blood cultures previously mentioned along
with the fact that the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drain output
transitioned to some creamy appearance.  The patient was
switched over the Vancomycin, meropenem, clindamycin and
fluconazole for his cultures, the worst of which was the
Clostridium perfringens. The patient also had a sputum
culture showing Klebsiella pneumonia and consolidation or
collapse in the retrocardiac area along with an ill defined
opacity in the right lung base.  By postoperative day seven
the patient was continuing to be weaned from Levophed along
with weaning from the PEEP respirator.  His tube feeds had
increased to 40 cc an hour.  By postoperative day ten the
patient was off Levophed, continued to be treated for his
Klebsiella pneumonia along with the Clostridium perfringens
in his swab with Vancomycin, Meropenem, Clindamycin, and
fluconazole.  The patient continued on CVVH.  His sedation
was weaned but he continued to be intubated.  His examination
by this point showed a soft nontender abdomen.  By
postoperative day 11 the patient was off of the amiodarone
drip with no more atrial fibrillation.  Patient was slowly
being weaned from the ventilator and the tube feeds were
slowly being advanced to goal rate.  The patient continued to
receive intravenous antibiotics.  The wound was noted to have
some fibrinous exudate along the edges and required surgical
debridement back to bleeding surfaces.  By postoperative day
14 the patient's propofol was discontinued, vent weaning was
continued, CVVH was planned for an additional two to three
days, antibiotics were continued and the patient's status
continued to improve.  On postoperative day 16 the patient's
wound continued to be an area of concern with bile draining
from the midportion of the incision.  The plans were made to
switch the patient over to hemodialysis.  Tube feeds were
switched to 2/3 strength.  Over the next few days the wound
drainage decreased and the wound looked clean.  On
postoperative day 19 the patient's antibiotics were
discontinued.  The patient had two C. diffs drawn that were
negative on [**4-9**] and [**4-12**].  The patient continued on
hemodialysis.  By postoperative day 20 the patient was noted
to have a soft nontender abdomen with no drainage from the
wound.  It was being packed at times with wet to dry
dressings.  The patient was transferred to the floor and
followed a fairly uneventful course except for periods of
periodic bradycardia for which his hypertension medications
were adjusted.  The patient also was found to have a
Vancomycin resistant enterococcal urinary tract infection for
which he was treated with a seen day course of L
