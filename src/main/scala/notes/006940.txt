Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Subdural Hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
82F w/ h/o multiple myeloma, peripheral neuropathy recently
hospitalized on neuro service for work-up of multiple falls
transferred from [**Hospital3 2783**] with dx of right SDH.  The
patient was found down, awake, in the afternoon by staff at
nursing home where she lives.  She was admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] about 2
weeks ago to work up the falls and at that time had negative
intracranial imaging (see detailed neurology note from [**2157-3-15**]).
The falls were thought to be due to a combination of neuropathy
post chemotherapy and mild cervical spondylosis and she was
discharged to a nursing home.  The current fall was unwitnessed
and it is not clear if there was any LOC. Patient denies any
dizziness, lightheadedness, vertigo, nausea/vomiting.  She also
comes with a new dx of PNA, possible aspiration PNA and was
treated with levaquin at OSH prior to arrival.

.

In the ED, initial vs were: T98.1, HR 80, BP 104/56, RR 14-16,
O2 99%RA. Patient was alert but somewhat confused.  Head CT
showed no interval change in mid-line shift or size of SDH.
Neurosurgery recommended 6-pack of plt's, DDAVP, Vit K (10mg IV)
and 2L NS.  Patient also received CTX for finding of pneumonia
on CXR.  Was admitted to MICU for q1H neuro checks and treatment
of pneumonia.  At time of transfer, VS 97.8, HR 80, Bp 96/41, RR
22 O2 97% 3L NC, RA sat of 93-94%

[**3-28**] CT Head:
IMPRESSION: Acute on chronic right subdural hematoma, unchanged
in comparison
study from five hours prior. 1-2mm of leftward shift of normally
midline
structures.

[**3-29**] CT Head:
Evolution of acute-on-chronic right subdural hematoma with
posterior layering of the acute component, now tracking along
the tentorium. There is no evidence for new hemorrhage,
increased mass effect, or edema.

[**4-2**] CT Head:
There has been not significant change in size of an acute on
chronic subdural hematoma, but evolution of blood products
within the
hematoma is seen. There is no shift of minimal mass effect on
subjacent right occipital gyri remains seen, and sulci are
unchanged in configuration. The sulci are otherwise prominent,
compatible with age-related involution. The ventricular
configuration is unchanged. Again seen is scattered
periventricular white matter hypodensities, consistent with
chronic microvascular ischemia.

Surrounding soft tissues and osseous structures are stable in
appearance.
There is no fracture. Imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION: Evolution of right subdural hematoma without
evidence for new
hemorrhage or increased mass effect. No new hemorrhage.

[**3-28**] CT C-spine:
1. No fracture or prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes, predominantly at C5-6 and
C6-7, unchanged in comparison to MRI [**2157-3-18**].

[**3-28**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic
velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Preserved biventricular global and regional systolic
function. Mild resting outflow tract gradient, likely due to
vigorous left ventricular function. Severe pulmonary
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Subdural Hematoma: Patient continued to have decreased level
of consciousness throughout the hospital stay. Neurosurgery was
consulted for acute on chronic SDH.
Vitamin K given for INR 1.3. ddavp given in ED given h/o aspirin
use. Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended transfusing
plt's with goal of >80, received 1 6-pack in ED. CT head and
subsequent MRI/MRA were significant for stable SDH but chronic
embolic events. Neurology was consulted and an EEG showed spike
and wave patterns consistent with pre-seizure activity. Dilantin
was given throughout the hospital course with no seizures noted.
.
# Hopsital Acquired Pneumonia. Has known PNA on CXR, treated
from the start.  Abx treatment included vanco and cefepime
started [**3-29**].  Did get one dose of ceftriaxone.  Was started on
levo for atypical coverage on [**3-29**] which was stopped [**4-2**].
Flagyl was started [**4-2**]. Culture data only positive for GPCs in
sputum, no speciation done.  Remained tachypneic but
oxygentating well until the date of death. The patient continued
to require high O2 supplementation on [**2157-4-8**] and over the course
of the day, the O2 sat declined, with a sharp decline in HR and
BP. The patient became hypoxic and bradycardic, and expired in
the afternoon. The family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and came to the hospital
for viewing. The PCP was notified.
.
# Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up
attributing LE weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and
multilevel degenerative disease with myelopathy and neuropathy.
Unclear if LOC with fall so would pursue syncope w/u, which is
likely [**3-7**] UE neuropathy, weakness, ? seizure in setting of SDH.
MRA showed no lesions.
.
# Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
.
# Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.  Stable.
.
# Renal Failure: At baseline from last admission.  Unclear
etiology to CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.
.
# Code: After family meeting, DNR/DNI was established.
