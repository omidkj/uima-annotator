NOTE:  This is an initial Discharge Summary spanning the
dated of [**2147-5-31**] through [**2147-6-23**].  The remainder of
this [**Hospital 228**] hospital course will be dictated as part of an
Addendum to this summary.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old
gentleman with a history of multiple myeloma who was - on the
day of admission - day 41 status post a matched unrelated
nonmyeloablative allogenic transplant.

His initial presenting complaint was shortness of breath and
cough.  The patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in
the Fall of [**2143**] when a bone marrow biopsy revealed myeloma
with hypercellular marrow with 66 percent plasma cells.  IgA
level was at 4910 at that time.  He was treated with VAD,
followed by stem cell mobilization with Cytoxan, with high-
dose chemotherapy stem cell rescue.

He did well for approximately for one year until decrease of
[**2145**] when his IgG levels rose.  He was treated with
thalidomide alone but developed neuropathy.  Decadron was
added, but he still had resistance of disease.  In [**2146-11-26**], he was treated with four cycles of Velcade, still
with a dropping platelet count, increasing neuropathy, and
only a modest decrease in his IgG level; which subsequently
then began to increase.

On [**2147-4-12**], he was admitted for a nonmyeloablative
allogenic transplant on the mini-MUD protocol.  Post
transplant course was complicated by acute graft-versus-host
disease of the gastrointestinal tract, congestive heart
failure with cardiomegaly, and renal insufficiency.  A bone
marrow biopsy and aspirate on day plus 30 showed extensive
involvement by plasma cell myeloma.  He was subsequently
tapered rapidly off his Neoral, which he tolerated without
any acute exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease.

On [**2147-5-31**], he presented to clinic with increasing
shortness of breath and an increased nonproductive cough.  A
repeat computer tomography of the chest was obtained which
revealed a linear opacity in the right middle lobe that was
felt to be either focal atelectasis versus focal pneumonia as
well as an increased size of pleural-based soft tissue
lesions.

ALLERGIES:  KEFLEX (which caused nausea and dizziness).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  In general,  the
patient was a pale and ill-appearing gentleman in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed the oropharynx was red.  The mucous membranes were
dry.  Skin revealed there were no rashes.  The lungs had
crackles at the right base.  Poor air movement throughout.
The heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  There were no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The chest revealed no tenderness
to palpation over the sternum or the anterior ribs.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There were
positive bowel sounds.  There was no hepatosplenomegaly.  The
extremities revealed there was no clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.  No calf tenderness.  Back revealed there was
costovertebral angle tenderness.  No vertebral tenderness.
Mild tenderness to palpation over the right posterior ribs.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 3.1, his hematocrit was 27.7, and his
platelets were 88.  His blood urea nitrogen was 18.  His
creatinine was 1.3.  Alanine-aminotransferase was 23, his
aspartate aminotransferase was 24, his lactate dehydrogenase
was 337, his alkaline phosphatase was 206, his total
bilirubin was 1.2, with an indirect bilirubin was 0.9.
Cytomegalovirus viral load from [**5-29**] not detected.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  A computed tomography of the
chest from [**2147-5-30**] revealed stable cardiomegaly,
increased size of the left anterior, left paravertebral,
right paravertebral pleural-based soft tissue lesions.  An
increased opacity in the right middle lobe; called as focal
atelectasis versus pneumonia.

An echocardiogram from [**2147-5-22**] revealed left atrium
and right atrium moderately dilated.  Left ventricular [**Known lastname **]
thickness was normal.  Left ventricular cavity was mildly
dilated.  Left ventricular systolic function was low-normal.
Ejection fraction of 50 percent to 75 percent.  Mild-to-
moderate 1 plus to 2 plus mitral regurgitation.  Borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  PULMONARY ISSUES:  His initial
presenting complaint was cough, mild shortness of breath, and
a concern of a right middle lobe process.  On presentation,
he was afebrile.  He was treated with Levaquin initially;
however, early on became febrile and was changed to therapy
with cefepime.

A Pulmonary consultation was called on hospital day three.
As per their recommendations, a _____________ was sent which
was negative as well as a Aspergillus ____________  level
which was also negative.  He was continued on treatment with
cefepime and Levaquin with minimal change in fever curve or
symptoms.

There was a discussion over the patient undergoing a
bronchoscopy; however, prior to that happening, the patient
developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate
with resulting hypotension and was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit.  The details of this will be dictated
below.  While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient
continued to be febrile despite Levaquin and cefepime.  Thus,
voriconazole was initiated for concern over a possible fungal
etiology.

On [**2147-6-5**], the patient had a repeat computed tomography
scan of the chest which showed an interval decrease in the
right middle lobe infiltrate with no new consolidations.  Due
to this radiographic improvement, it was felt that holding
off on bronchoscopy was advisable, and the patient was
continued on Levaquin and voriconazole alone.  The patient
subsequently became afebrile.  Thus, it was decided to
complete a course of antibiotics as there was still no clear
indication of the etiology of this right middle lobe process.
The voriconazole was stopped first, and he then completed a
14-day course of Levaquin without further fevers.

Throughout the remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, he
continued to have a nonproductive cough as well as to be
tachypneic.  However, he remained afebrile to the date of
this summary.

ACID BASE ISSUES:  As the patient was tachypneic, and it was
noted that his bicarbonate was low at 14 to 18, a blood gas
was performed.  This revealed a pH of 742, a pO2 of 100, and
a pCO2 of 21.

The Renal team was consulted to help with interpreting this,
and they felt that this represented a chronic respiratory
alkalosis, and that the low bicarbonate was compensation for
that and did not represent a primary metabolic acidosis.  The
Renal and Pulmonary teams worked together to develop a
differential diagnosis which included hypoxia; such as
secondary to a pulmonary embolism, a central process such as
a cerebrovascular accident, or meningitis/encephalitis, and
medication.

The suspicion for a pulmonary embolism was low given his pO2
of 100 on room air, and a computed tomography angiogram of
the chest was undesira
