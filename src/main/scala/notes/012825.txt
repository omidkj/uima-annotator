History of Present Illness:
Pt's a 82 yo F with h/o HTN, h/o of prox a-fib, (not on
coumadin), mood disorder on depakote (has had since CVA 4 yrs
prior), with prior L inferior division MCA infarct now
presenting with altered mental status.  Pt basically at baseline
AA0x2, has been reclusive living alone with mood disorder since
her stroke - but has family heavily involved in her care -
including ex-husband who visits daily.  Pt basically has been at
her baseline (which is described as more aggressive - usually
asking her family to leave within 10-15minutes of being around
her), but then 3-4 days ago noted being more lethargic - less
aggressive but without any other notable complaints per
ex-husband who saw pt then (no report of CP, F/C, HA, SOB as
best assessed).  Family getting concerned - were thinking would
be needing more higher level care placement as pt generally
weaker (no focal weaknesses) - but Sunday started appearing at
baseline again.  Pt was seen Monday early and was doing well
(has called ex-husband roughly around 2pm and noted again at her
baseline) - however when home aide came by apartment today in
the morning - pt did not respond to door - found lethargic with
emesis/stool/urine around her.  No further information able to
be obtained related to any events preceding to the evident n/v,
bowel/stool incontinance.
<br>

Pt denies any cp, ha symptoms - can not elaborate further - was
sent to ED - noted aggitated, +echolalia described in ED and
from home aide initially - all consistant per family with her
prior CVA 4 yrs prior.  CT head without sig changes - however
noted poor quality due to aggitation - neurology consulted.
Noted trop elevated 1.12 - cardiology called - stated will not
cath at present but for full medical treatment.  Pt had been put
in restraints in ED with foley placed - pt was subsequently
severely aggitated.  On arrival to floor - pt much calmer - not
in restraints - family at bedside.
<br>

In [**Name (NI) **] pt treated with hep gtt, ASA/Plavix (though pt refused to
take), IV metoprolol (due to declining po meds), and vanc
1g/ceftriaxone 1g - for emperic treatment with leukocytosis (d/w
ED resident - they stated just emperic tx with leukocytosis -
were not aiming towards meningitis at time or any focal
infection).

Social History:

CXR:  IMPRESSION:
1. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, without evidence of
pulmonary edema and without change compared to [**2109**], suggesting
possible cardiomyopathy.
2. Slight increased, now moderate-sized hiatal hernia.

Non-contrast Head CT:
IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage or obvious major acute area of
infarction.
If acute infarction is of clinical concern, MR has improved
sensitivity in comparison to non-contrast head CT.
Chronic infarct in left MCA distribution.

Cardiac Echo:
Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum, anterior wall and
apex. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitra
