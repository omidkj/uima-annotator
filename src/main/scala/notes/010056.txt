Chief Complaint:
s/p cardiac arrest requiring balloon pump for pressure support

Intraarterial balloon pump removal
Central venous line placement
Central venous line removal
Cardioversion attempt x 2

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 15942**] is a 73 year-old female with pmh of dementia, newly
diagnosed hyperthyroidism on methimizole, and atrial
fibrillation s/p cardiac arrest being transferred from [**Hospital 6451**] Hospital due to hypotension requiring a balloon pump.

She had presented to the [**Hospital3 **] ED the night prior to
admission with shortness of breath and was treated with
combivent and discharged home.  The night of admissison she
collapsed in the presence of her family with a reported down
time of about 5-10 minutes.  Her family called 911 (at 22:23)
and CPR was initiated by the fire department while awaiting EMS.
 An AED advised no shock as her initial rhythm showed a
ventricular escape which was paced externally.  Reportedly she
had pulses for about 10 minutes, then went asystolic while still
in the field.  Chest compressions were started and she was
intubated by EMS.  She underwent 2 rounds of epi, atropine, and
bicarb.  CPR continued into her arrival in the ED for another 15
minutes with more rounds of epi, atropine, and bicarb.  She
eventually developed a sinus tachycardia with SBPs in the 80s on
neo.

EKG showed new ST elevations in her inferior leads.  She was
loaded with 600 mg of plavix, given 325 mg of ASA.  She was also
given 125 mg of solumedrol in the ED.  She was sent to the cath
lab emergently.  She again lost a pulse with bradycardia to the
40s while being prepped on the cath lab table and underwent an
additional round of CPR with epi, bicarb, and atropine.  Her HR
increased with this treatment to the 90's and her pulse
returned.

Of note she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2-20**] to [**2-24**]
when she presented with chest discomfort and was found to have
new atrial fibrillation and hyperthyroidism.  At that
hospitalization she was started on methimazole and propanolol
for her hyperthyroidism and propanolol and aspirin for atrial
fibrillation.  Her course was complicated by delirium on chronic
dementia and psychiatry was consulted and made medication
changes to her psych meds.

On arrival to the CCU her SBP were in the 180's to 200's.  Her
dopa and neo were turned off and she was given 10 mg IV
labetalol for persistently elevated blood pressures.

12:55 am [**3-3**] - STE in II, III, avF (1 box)

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. A
small secundum atrial septal defect is present. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The presence/absence of mitral valve prolapse cannot
be determined (poor image quality in certain views). No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 15942**] is a 73 year-old female with dementia, newly
diagnosed hyperthyroidism on methimizole, and atrial
fibrillation s/p cardiac arrest complicated by persistent
hypotension resulting in death.

She arrived in the CCU with hypertension and her pressors were
stopped.  Persistent hypertension with SBPs in the 180's to 200s
required treatment with labetalol 10 mg IV.  Her balloon pump
was removed.  On admission there was also concern for lack of
distal pump in her left leg (the leg with the balloon pump).  A
heparin gtt was continued due to concern for limb ischemia after
removal of the balloon pump.  The decision was made to do
hypothermia protocol due to her arrest, however on arrival she
was < 33 degree celceius so no cooling was initiated.

The etiology of her cardiac arrest is unclear.  She had no
occlusive thrombus or CAD on cath making ischemic cardiac arrest
unlikely.  Given her recent diagnosis of hyperthyoridism, there
was some concern that thyroid toxicosis could have caused her
presentation, however she was supposed to have been on
methimazole which should have presented this.  Due to concern
for thyroid toxicosis as a cause of her presentation and
recurrent tachycardias causing hypotension endocrinology was
consulted, however she decompensated before any of their
recommendations could be given.  TSH and free T4 were pending at
time
