History of Present Illness:
68 year old male who has been complaining of worsening fatigue
as well as mild exertional dyspnea. In addition he was four
pillow orthopnea and occasional
PND. He has been followed for mitral regurgitation and most
recent echo revealed severe mitral regurgitation with prolapse
of posterior mitral valve leaflet likely due to chordal rupture.
He is now referred for surgical evaluation.

Neuro: non-focal

Pertinent Results:
[**2136-9-26**] ECHO: PRE-BYPASS:  The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is moderate/severe mitral
valve prolapse. The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is
>=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results on [**Known lastname 36066**], W at 09:45 before CPB. Post_Bypass: Normal RV
systolic function. LVEF 45%. There is a ring in the mitral
postion with no residual regurgitation. There is no [**Male First Name (un) **].
Thoracic aorta is intact. Trivial TR.

[**2136-9-30**] CXR: As compared to the previous examination, the extent
of the pre-existing right pneumothorax has not substantially
changed. There are no signs of tension. Unchanged aspect of the
cardiac silhouette and of the remaining lung parenchyma. No
newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 36066**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2136-9-26**] for surgical
management of his mitral valve disease. He was taken to the
operating room where he underwent a mitral valve repair. Please
see operative note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to
the intensive care unit for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Over the next 4 hours, he awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated. He had some ventricular and atrial ectopy
which was treated with amiodarone. On postoperative day one, he
was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He
was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. He had
atrial fibrillation in the 50-60's with slowing to the 40's.
Electrophysiology was consulted and they recommended stopping
amiodarone and beta-blockers and start anticoagulation.  He was
started on Warfarin. Chest tubes were removed on post-op day
two. A follow-up chest film showed small apical pneumothorax and
bilateral effusion. Epicardial pacing wires were removed on
post-op day three. He was seen by physical therapy for strength
and mobility who eventually cleared him for discharge home. His
pain was well controlled on oral pain medication.  He made
steady progress and was discharged to home with VNA services on
post-op day six. He will follow-up as an outpatient and with his
cardiologist for further Coumadin management.
