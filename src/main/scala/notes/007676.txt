CONTINUATION OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the [**9-11**] the
patient appeared to be more confused.  A repeat head CT
showed a stable appearance of her hemorrhage and her
confusion was contributed to the amount of blood in her
ventricles.  Also on the [**9-12**] the patient did have
a nutrition screen and this recommended the patient to have
some assistance with eating.  On the [**9-13**] the
patient was found to have an INR of 1.5.  She was given 2
more units of fresh frozen platelets.  She was oriented to
person and place.  She remained in the Intensive Care Unit
for blood pressure control.  She has difficulty keeping her
blood pressure less then 170 without medications.  She also
did require 3% saline due to a sodium of 130, increased to
132 with 30 cc per hour of 3% saline.  She did have a central
line placed in order to administer the 3% saline and that was
put in without difficulty.  On the [**9-17**] the
patient was transferred to the surgical floor.  Her 3% saline
was discontinued and she was put on strict fluid of a
restriction of 750 cc a day.  Her sodium on transfer was 135.
 She was awake, alert, conversant, following commands, face
was symmetric.  The patient was also started on Boost t.i.d.
due to poor po intake.  We have discussed possibly giving her
tube feedings, however, we decided to push po food and
continue with supplements.  She was seen by occupational and
rehab therapy who recommended acute rehab therapy or gait
training, cognitive training and functional mobility.  The
patient had been started on Levofloxacin on the [**9-11**] for presumed urinary tract infection.  She should
complete Levofloxacin for a ten day course ending on the [**9-21**].

On the [**9-19**] the patient remained awake, alert and
oriented times three at this point with good strength
throughout with her grafts on the right side were 4 out of 5
and her IPs on her right side were 4 out of 5.  Discussed to
discontinue her peripheral line, continued to restrict any
free water, fluid restriction of 750 cc an hour.  Her sodium
on the [**9-19**] was 132, which had been stable from
the previous day.  The patient will be transferred to acute
rehab once her sodium remained stable.  She should follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in one months time with repeat head CT.
