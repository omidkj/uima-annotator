who presented with three days of abdominal pain and
distention.  No nausea or vomiting.  The pain started three
days prior to admission and was diffuse followed by abdominal
distention.  He had no fevers or chills but did not have

1.  Nissen fundoplication in [**2175**].
2.  Bilateral inguinal hernia repairs.
3.  Peripheral neuropathy.
4.  Question Charcot [**Doctor First Name **] tooth disease.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.6,
pulse 105, blood pressure 158/78, respiratory rate 40.  Lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart had a regular
rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was firm and distended with mild
right-sided tenderness.  No guarding.  No percussion
tenderness.  Rectal examination revealed normal tone, normal
prostate, heme-negative.  Extremities were warm.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 7.5,
hematocrit was 45, platelets of 179.  Sodium was 139,
potassium was 3.4, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 21, BUN
was 57, creatinine was 1.6, sugar was 176.  ALT was 59, AST
was 78, alkaline phosphatase was 111, total bilirubin
was 3.5, direct bilirubin was 1.8, amylase was 411, lipase
was 660.

Abdominal x-ray showed dilated loops of small bowel with
air/fluid levels.

Abdominal CT showed dilated small bowel with small pockets of
free air, positive pneumatosis, and positive portal venous
gas with distended small bowel.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with a diagnosis
of small-bowel obstruction with a secondary diagnosis of
ileus secondary to gallstone pancreatitis.  He was admitted
and given IV fluids and ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and Flagyl
IV antibiotics and made n.p.o.

He was taken to the operating room on [**2190-2-28**], with
a preoperative diagnosis of small-bowel obstruction and a
postoperative diagnosis of small-bowel obstruction.  The
operation was lysis of adhesions.  Findings included adhesive
bands crossing the small bowel at the inferior portion of the
prior midline incision.  The bowel was decompressed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube was placed.  It was noted that there were some
areas of ischemic bowel, but nothing was gangrenous.  The
plan was to take the patient back for a second look operation
the next day.  He was admitted to the surgical intensive care
unit, intubated and sedated; otherwise, stable.  He did well.
He was continued on propofol overnight and morphine for
comfort and kept n.p.o. with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube and NG-tube to low
wall suction.

On [**3-1**], he was taken back for a second look.  No
resection was necessary.  Findings included small bowel which
was viable, some submucosal hemorrhage.  All small bowel was
viable.  He was returned back to the intensive care unit,
intubated and sedated and continued on ampicillin,
ceftriaxone, and Flagyl.  In the surgical intensive care unit
his sedation was weaned, and he was extubated on [**2190-3-8**].  He was also started on total parenteral nutrition
during his surgical intensive care unit stay.

Also of note, on [**3-5**], he spiked a fever to a temperature
maximum of 101.5 overnight with a concomitant increase in
white blood cell count to 5900.  It was thought that the
fever was likely due to pneumonia, and sputum cultures were
taken which eventually grew out Citrobacter.

An infectious disease consultation was called, and they
recommended starting levofloxacin IV and continuing
ampicillin and Flagyl at that time.  He was transferred to
the floor on [**2190-3-8**], in stable condition, and his
[**Hospital Ward Name **] tube was slowly discontinued while on the floor.  The
[**Hospital Ward Name **] tube finally came out on [**2190-3-11**], and he was
started on a clear liquid diet which he tolerated well.  His
diet was advanced on [**3-13**] to a regular diet which he also
tolerated well, and he was also switched to all of his p.o.
medications.  He was getting out of bed and continuing to
progress, so the decision was made to transfer him to the
postanesthesia care unit to the care of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] for further
treatment and rehabilitation.  His IV antibiotics, and he was
continued on p.o. Levaquin on discharge.


MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. until [**3-19**].
2.  Hydralazine 20 mg p.o. q.i.d.
3.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Albuterol 7 cc and 7 cc normal saline q.4h. p.r.n.
5.  Mucomyst 3 cc and 5 cc normal saline q.4h. p.r.n.
6.  Haldol 2 mg IV q.4h. p.r.n.

FOLLOWUP:  He was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and to call for an appointment in about one week.  On a
regular diet.  No physical activity restrictions.  Potential
for full recovery.
