Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was seen and evaluated in the emergency room and the
decision was made to take the patient urgently to the OR given
her clinical evidence of impending bowel compromise.  She was
given 2U FFP pre-operatively.

On [**2140-4-8**], she underwent exploratory laparotomy, repair of
incarcerated
paraesophageal hernia with feeding gastrostomy and splenectomy.
A g-tube was placed.

She tolerated the procedure well and was admitted to the SICU
post-operatively.  She developed oliguria in the immediate
post-operative period, requiring fluid boluses.  She had a
period of desaturation requiring CPAP, and also developed atrial
fibrillation for which she was given lopressor.

Her tube feeds were begun within 48 hours post-operatively and
were advanced to goal, which she tolerated.  On [**2140-4-12**], she was
out of bed to a chair but requiring face mask oxygen
supplementation.  She continued to improve clincally and her
oxygen requirement decreased until she was tolerating oxygen via
nasal cannula.

She was transitioned to the floor on [**4-16**], where she has been
tolerating a regular diet (~300cc/day), tube feeds at goal via
her G-tube, and maintaining oxygen saturations >90% on 4L nasal
cannula.  She has had occasional periods of desaturation into
the high 80s percent,  but was overall quite stable.  She was
given albuterol and steroid nebulizers/inhalers with good
effect.

By the time of discharge to rehab on [**4-18**], the patient was awake
and alert, voiding, moving her bowels, and oxygenating well.
Her pain was well controlled.  She expressed her readiness to be
discharged from the hospital.
