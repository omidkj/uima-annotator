Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Coumadin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
slurred speech, facial droop, and weakness.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Nasogastric tube placement

History of Present Illness:
The pt is an 83 year-old right-handed woman with a past medical
history significant for prior right mesial temporal lobe ([**2122**]),
right insular ([**2125**]), and right cerebellar stroke, HTN, DM,
hypercholesterolemia, CAD s/p CABG [**2113**], and afib recently off
coumadin for nose bleed and who is transferred from an OSH with
slurred speech, facial droop and right hand weakness. The
patient
originally presented to the [**Hospital3 1443**] hospital on
[**2129-9-6**] with slurred speech and some confusion. The differential
on admission was an ischemic stroke or complications of a UTI
noted on UA. She was placed on a heparin ggt. An initial head CT
and a subsquent MRI were negative for acute stroke per report.
The UTI was treated with levofloxacin and the patient's symptoms
seemed
to resolve when she abruptly worsened on [**2129-9-8**]. At that time
she became completely mute, developed a right facial droop, and
some fumbling vs. weakness of her right hand. A stat CT was
performed which revealed no acute bleed. Blood was noted to be
50mmhg systolic and she was transferred to the ICU. Repeat head
CT was negative per report. The patient also had an ECHO while
at the OSH which did no demonstrate any clots and an EF of 40%
mod MR, TR, and pulm HTN. Today's labs at the OSH were notable
for a bicarbonate of 17, creatinine of 1.7, WBC 14.4 and a PTT
that was above the linear range of detection. The patient was
transferred for further stroke management.

ROS
the patient is mute and unable to provide a full ROS.

Past Medical History:
- Atrial fibrillation-3 years

palpate, but dopplerable DP pulses.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.



Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert. Unable to relate history. Does not speak
at all. Appears to understand certain questions but not others.
For example she will close her eyes to command, but doesn't show
2 fingers or a thumb correctly. She had some difficult with left
vs. right. There was no evidence of neglect - able to track
examiner on either side of her body.



-Cranial Nerves: Olfaction not tested. PERRL 2mm and poorly
reactive to light. VF untested. There is no ptosis bilaterally.
Funduscopic exam precluded by small pupils. Normal saccades.
Right facial droop noted. Hearing intact to finger-rub
bilaterally. Palate elevates not visualized. Trapezii and SCM
bilaterally. Tongue deviates to the right.



-Motor: Patient unable to cooperate with formal strength
testing.
She has at least 4- strength in the delts and IPs bilaterally as
I was able to get her to hold each of these limbs high in the
air. No adventitious movements.



-Sensory: Appears to detect light touch in her limbs but can not
report this.



-Coordination: No intention tremor. No dysmetria on FNF
bilaterally.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2129-9-9**] 2:44 PM

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to an MR of the head from [**2125-11-16**].
There are no intracranial hemorrhages.
There is a new hypodensity with loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter
differentiation as well as some effacement of sulci involving
the left frontal lobe and a small portion of the left insula in
the left middle cerebral artery distribution consistent with a
new acute or subacute infarct.

Again seen is encephalomalacia of the right temporal lobe and
adjacent right insula with ex vacuo dilatation of the temporal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle. Also again seen is an old
encephalomalacia of the right inferior cerebellum.

The ventricles are unchanged in size since the prior study.

The visualized orbits show post-cataract surgical changes. There
are extensive carotid siphon arterial calcifications. The
visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear
cavities are clear. No suspicious bony abnormalities are seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. New acute or subacute infarct of the left middle cerebral
artery distribution.
2. No intracranial hemorrhages.
3. Old infarcts of the right temporal lobe and right inferior
cerebellum.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2123-10-15**], the left ventricular
ejection fraction is increased.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted from an OSH to the Neuro ICU
at [**Hospital1 18**].  CT scan of the head confirmed an infarct in the LMCA
territory likely due to atrial fibrillation.  She was continued
on a heparin drip and started on Coumadin.  The INR target is
2.0-2.5.  Given her recent cauterization for epistaxis on
coumadin, an ENT consult was called to place a Doboff tube.  The
patient was given humidified air overnight and the tube was
placed without difficulty.  She had two swallow evaluations and
it was decided that the patient should remain NPO.  The speech
therapist also recommended a PEG tube but the family wanted to
wait to see if the patient's swallowing improved at rehab.  The
patient's PTT goal is 50-70 until her Coumadin level is
therapeutic.  She finished a 7 day course of Levofloxacin for a
UTI diagnosed on [**9-6**] at an OSH.  She was seen by PT and
determined to be suitable to rehab.  The patient was given a
follow up appointment to be seen in the [**Hospital 107467**] clinic as well
as the stroke clinic.
