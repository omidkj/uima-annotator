History of Present Illness:
76 M h/o recurrent C.diff, hiatal hernia, Parkinsons, HTN, and
GIB. Pt initially presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] with shortness of
breath and general malaise. Finished recent course of cipro for
UTI and 1 dose Levoquin for cough. Noted to have diffuse ST
elevations and received aspirin, statin, heparin, plavix.
Transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath, required levophed in cath lab.
Cath on [**10-23**] demonstrated coronary arteries without
angiographically apparent disease.
.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, had fever, stool studies
confirmed severe sepsis from C.diff requiring pressors. GI and
Surgical consultation were obtained with recommendation for
continuation of medical management. He had NG placed for concern
of aspiration; tube was unable to be placed
sub-diaphragmatically due to a large hiatal hernia. Had PICC
placed by IR.
.
Pt transfered to floor on [**10-29**] but triggered for hypotension and
returned to MICU. Received short course of pressors. Vancomycin
was increased and was treated with IVIG on [**10-30**]. He demonstated
a subsequent improvement in his WBC count to 14.2 on [**11-5**].
Aspirin was stopped due to positive guaiac stools. Pt remained
stable and was transferred to medical floor on [**11-5**].
.
On the floor, pt was found to have a nonocclusive thrombus in
the right subclavian vein surrounding the indwelling PICC
catheter on [**11-7**]. His PICC was pulled and he was started on a
heparin gtt. Pt developed gauaic positive stools with bright red
blood per rectum on [**11-8**]. He was evaluated by GI and surgery. Pt
HCT dropped from 29 on [**11-7**] to 25 on [**11-9**]. Heparin gtt DC'd. PTT
130. He was transferred back to the MICU, where he remained
stable over the course of 3 days.
.
On recent transfer to floor on [**2165-11-12**] s/p IVC filter, L arm
PICC on [**2165-11-11**]. Pt otherwise felt well on floor.

[**10-23**] Cardiac cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenosis
in the
LMCA, LAD, LCx, or RCA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamic measurements (taken while the
patient was
receiving 8 mcg/min of levophed IV) revealed mildly elevated
right
atrial pressure (mean 9 mmHg) and normal pulmonary artery
pressure
(27/11 mmHg).  The left sided filling pressure was normal
with a mean PCWP of 12 mmHg.  The systemic arterial pressure was
low at
91/57 mmHg.  The cardiac output, calculated using an assumed
oxygen
consumption, was preserved at 2.5 l/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred given the patient's
reduced
GFR.

ECHO: Limited study.  Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pulmonary consolidations, left more than right,
could reflect
aspiration pneumonia in the setting of hiatal hernia. There is
also an
abnormal appearance to the hypopharynx, which is gas-distended
with apparent external laryngoceles, which may relate to
aspiration risk.

2. Massively distended sigmoid colon measuring up to 10.3 cm.
There is a
transition point at the rectosigmoid junction with fullness in
the rectum and associated mural edema. Overall, these findings
reflect potential rectosigmoid obstruction possibly from
volvulus, occult mass or stricture. Within limitations on
non-contrast evaluation, no associated secondary signs of
inflammation or ischemia were noted.

4. Cystic structure adjacent to the proximal third part of
duodenum as
described above may represent a duodenal duplication
cyst/fluid-filled
duodenal diverticulum. Other differential considerations include
cystic
neoplasm or, less likely, aneurysm, overall incompletely
evaluated in the non- contrast setting.
.
Video Swallow [**10-28**]
FINDINGS: Bolus control, bolus formation and anterior to
posterior tongue
movement were moderately reduced, with AP rolling of the oral
bolus. Oral
transit times were mildly to moderately increased. Laryngeal
elevation and
laryngeal valve closure were moderately reduced. Moderate
vallecular residue
remained after the swallow, requiring multiple followup swallows
to clear.
Episodes of aspiration were noted to occur after the swallow
secondary to
pharyngeal residue across all administered consistencies,
including honey-
thick liquid, nectar-thick liquid, and puree consistency.
Intermittent
reflexive coughing was effective in clearing penetration within
the laryngeal
vestibule. However, acute and reflexive coughing was ineffective
in clearing
aspiration beyond the level of the vocal cords. Initiation of
cough was weak
and ineffective in clearing the penetrated material. Residue was
also noted
on the NG tube within the pharynx, also contributing to
penetration of
material into the airway after the swallow. Chin tuck techniques
were
attempted, but were ineffective in preventing or eliminating
aspiration.
