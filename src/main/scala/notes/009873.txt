SERVICE:  Trauma surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81 year old female,
with a history of hypothyroidism.  She was found by her
neighbors down on her back porch. It was unknown at the time
how long the patient was down for.  The patient was unable to
give any history.  She ws brought into the Emergency Room.
Core temperature was noted to be 86 degrees F.  The patient
is known to have history of weakness, fatigue, malaise and 10
pound weight loss and dizziness over the last several months.
Her family believes that this may have contributed to her
fall.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, the
patient's initial vital signs were temperature of 88 degrees;
pulse of 72 and blood pressure 80/palpable, respiratory rate
of 14.  The patient was 100 percent on non rebreather.
General appearance:  The patient appeared sedated.  Body was
noted to be cold.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils
were 6 mm and minimally reactive to light.  Cardiovascular:
Normal S1 and S2 with regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs were
with coarse breath sounds bilaterally. Extremities revealed a
large bruise over the right lower extremity and what looked
to be chemical type burns.  Distal pulses were 2 plus
bilaterally.  As stated before, the patient was noted to be
cold and clammy in appearance.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was started on warmed inhaled
oxygen immediately, warmed intravenous fluids and warming
blankets were placed. The patient was placed in a hard collar
and sent to the CAT scan.  At that time, she underwent
pulseless electrical activity arrest.  The patient was given
1 mg of epinephrine, 1 mg of Atropine, 2 amps of bicarbonate
and the patient returned with pulse and blood pressure
appropriately.  The blood gas showed improvement at this
time.  The patient was admitted to the trauma surgical
service and also evaluated by the plastic surgery team.  They
recommended Silvadene cream topically twice a day to her burn
wounds. There was no concern for compartment syndrome at this
time.  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
for further evaluation and treatment.  Chest x-ray revealed
no significant findings at this time.  Pelvis x-ray revealed
no fractures.  CAT scan of the head was negative.  CAT scan
of the cervical spine was negative.  CAT scan of the torso
revealed some lymph nodes with no acute process likely,
showing spleen enhancement heterogeneous in nature.  Minimal
thickening of the first portion of the duodenum and a
pancreatic head 9 by 17 mm low density mass and mesenteric
fat stranding.  The patient was able to have her collar
removed when the magnetic resonance scan of the head and
cervical spine returned.  The patient, at this time, was also
receiving Levophed for blood pressure assistance.  The
patient was also sedated on Propofol and was resuscitated
actively with Crystalloid solution.  The patient was
receiving Fentanyl for pain control as well.

The patient was also evaluated by cardiology who noted that
there was no indication for catheterization at this point.
She was to receive an exercise tolerance test if she
clinically improves and was able to exercise, and to be
careful in terms of monitoring for possible signs of
pulmonary embolus.  On hospital day three, Ipratropium was
added for increased wheeziness on examination and likely
failure on chest x-ray.  Tube feeds were also started and the
patient's fluid was hep-locked.  The patient's cervical
collar was removed as the magnetic resonance scan revealed no
signs of cord involvement or fracture, in addition to the CAT
scan of the cervical spine was obtained.

On hospital day number four, the patient was extubated and
was started on Ampicillin for pan sensitive Enterococcus.  On
hospital day number five, the patient was able to be weaned
off of Levophed and insulin drips.  The patient responded
well and was noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation this
morning, [**2138-1-6**] and received Diltiazem twice.  She
had no chest pain at this time and an electrocardiogram
revealed atrial fibrillation.  The patient was cardioverted
and was rebolused with Amiodarone appropriately.  The patient
responded by returning to sinus rhythm.  The patient received
a swallowing evaluation on [**2138-1-6**].  The patient
was able to receive regular diet as tolerated. Her voice also
began to improve in quality.  On hospital day number six, the
patient was taken to the operating room for tangential
excision of right lower extremity eschar down to viable
tissue.  The patient was also assessed by physical therapy
who suggested need for a stint in rehabilitation facility.
On hospital day number seven, the patient was noted to be
having some difficulty with chest pain in the morning,
shortly after transfer from the Intensive Care Unit.  An
electrocardiogram was done that revealed no significant
changes.  The patient was ruled out via enzymes.  Chest x-ray
was obtained and this revealed her to be somewhat in
congestive heart failure.  The patient received Lasix at this
time and then improved her respiratory status.  She proceeded
to not have any more complaints of chest pain or shortness of
breath during her stay.

On [**2138-1-10**], the patient was noted to be stable and
afebrile. Vital signs were within normal limits.  Examination
revealed the patient's VAC drain placed the prior day to be
functioning well and on continuous therapy.  Plan for the VAC
drain was to have it changed every three days.  It was placed
on Thursday, [**1-9**].  The next change would occur on
Sunday or Monday.
