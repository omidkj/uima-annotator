CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2162-11-8**] 1:32 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o inf, eff

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old woman s/p CABG, superficial sternal wound infection
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o inf, eff
INDICATION: Status post CABG with superficial sternal wound
infection.

Portable AP chest dated [**2162-11-8**] is compared to the prior from
[**2162-11-3**]. The patient has been extubated and a tracheostomy tube
has been placed, which is positioned in the mid-trachea at the
thoracic inlet. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. A
right subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the
region of the cavoatrial junction; however, the tip is not well
seen. The heart size and mediastinal contours are stable. The
lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Status post tracheostomy. No acute cardiopulmonary
abnormality
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2162-11-4**] 8:52 AM

PORTABLE ABDOMEN

Reason: evaluate for contrast passage

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old woman with s/p sternal wound and trach/j tube
placement
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for contrast passage
HISTORY: 68-year-old female status post sternal wound,
tracheostomy and J- tube placement. Here to evaluate for
contrast passage.

COMPARISON: Abdominal radiograph of [**2162-11-3**].

FINDINGS: A single portable semi-erect radiographed view of the
abdomen reveals a small amount of contrast remaining within the
colon. The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable. An NG tube is seen
with its tip in the stomach. No jejunal tube is seen. A vertical
abdominal staple line is seen. Surgical clips are seen in the
thorax. Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracolumbar
spine.

IMPRESSION: Small amount of contrast remains within the colon
only. No evidence of obstruction. A jejunal tube is not seen,
however, a nasogastric tube is seen with its tip in the stomach.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
