Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50 M smoker w/last CD4 of 111 from HIV, CAD h/o 7 MIs,
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome who presented to the ED w/one
week of increasing SOB and cough productive of yellow sputum.
.
# Resp distress - Suspect inciting event combination of PCP/PNA,
asthma and CHF, now with concern for developing ARDS given
hypoxemia. Viral/legionella neg (cultures pending). Chest CT
with multifocal PNA; started on IV bactrim & steroids for
concern for PCP (esp given very low CD4 count). [**Name (NI) **], pt
resisted BiPAP with tachypnea throughout day; abd he was
intubated. Pt. had acidosis and continued to have bad gases
throughout his stay. Multiple attempts to wean FiO2 not
well-tolerated. CXR concerning for ARDS.  Pt. was on
ceftriaxone/azithromycin for empiric 1wk course
.
# hypotension/sepsis - Sepsis protocol activated on admission,
but unable to get central line; has not needed pressors,
however. Suspect pt hypovolemic on admission [**3-13**] poor PO intake.
Likely still dehydrated from full day of tachypnea but careful
with IVF given CHF.  Pt. diuresed throughout stay.  Once pt. was
no longer febrile, he continued to have hypotension and require
fluid boluses to maintain b.p.
.
# CAD/NSTEMI - h/o 7 MIs s/p stentx2. last ECHO [**12-14**] WMA
inf/inflt hypokinesis/akinesis. LVEF ?30-35%, 1+MR/(1+), E/A
ratio 0.73. Atypical CP overnight with ST changes in setting of
tachycardia and tachypnea before intubation, troponin increased.
On ASA and anticoagulation, given NTG for pain. Holding lipitor
for slight increase in LFTs.  Pt. continued on ASA.  BB hard to
give b/c of hypotension.
.
# Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome - goal INR is 3.5-4.0 as
with APLA syndrome as well as a history of PE in the past ('[**75**]).
Pt. was on a heparin drip and then coumadin
.
#. Acute renal failure- Creatinine 1.0 baseline and on
admission.  This improved w/ adequate fluid resuscitation.
.
#. AIDS/HIV - CD4 count 22, down from 115 ([**2188-4-24**])
- Cont HAART meds Epivir 150 [**Hospital1 **], Viread 300 QD, Sustiva 600
QHS, Zerit 30 [**Hospital1 **]
- PPX Ayclovir 400 [**Hospital1 **]
.
# Anemia - stable; Hct threshold <28 given NSTEMI

On [**6-18**], pt's family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and discussed the possibility
of a PEG and trach given difficult wean.  Family decided that
pt. would not want this and it was decided that pt. would be
made comfort care only.  Pt. died of cardiopulmonary arrest
shortly after this decision.
