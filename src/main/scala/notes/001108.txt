Chief Complaint:
hyponatremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
75 y/o M with a history significant for COPD with 2L home O2
requirement, CHF, A-fib and recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] in
[**Month (only) 205**] for PNA and hyponatremia, from which he left AMA, who
presented to PCP the morning PTA for evaluation of vomitting and
was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED after labs revealed Na 111. N.B. the
patient and his wife speak primarily Italian but together are
able to provide a coherent history.
.
He is here with his wife who explains that he has "not been
himself" for the past week--low energy, no appetite. Mr.
[**Known lastname 13858**] confirms that he has not been eating much, and is
unsure why. Reports an 8-10lb weight loss over the past [**2-26**]
weeks. Admits also to cough and SOB, with  "doubling" of his
home O2 requirement to be comfortable. He has also had nausea
and vomiting for two days, and also admits to thirst. Denies
fevers/chills, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea and
constipation.
.
Notably, during his prior admission, he presented with
hyponatremia to the mid 120??????s which corrected with 50mg
hydrocortisone x7 days. He was not discharged home on steroids.
.
On presentation to the ED VS T98 HR73 BP151/75 RR18 O2Sat100%
(FiO2 unclear). [**Name2 (NI) **] in the ED he had a CT head which was WNL,
a CXR with evidence of hyperinflation but no evidence of PNA.
Labs were significant for serum Na 111 BUN 9 Cr 0.8, urine Na
37, and Uosm 272. He was started on IVF at 125 cc/hr and also
received vancomycin 1g and levofloxaacin 750mg IV for presumed
pneumonia.  Given the severity of the hyponatremia, he was
admitted to ICU for further management.

Imaging:
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL VIEWS ([**8-28**]):
Evaluation is limited by exclusion of the right costophrenic
sulcus.
Lungs are hyperexpanded with flattened diaphragms and widening
of the AP diameter. There is relative hyperlucency of the lungs
suggesting chronic obstructive lung disease. Small left pleural
effusion is present as well as a residua of a prior infection in
LLL.  Heart size is enlarged as before. There is tortuosity of
the thoracic aorta and enlargement of the pulmonary arteries.
Two leads follow a normal course from the left-sided battery
pack terminating in the expected region of the right atrium and
right ventricle. There is no overt edema.
.
CT head ([**8-28**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
75M with history significant for COPD, CHF, recent admission for
PNA and hyponatremia from which he left AMA, who presented with
hyponatremia in the setting of two days of n/v and ~1 week of
poor PO intake.
.
# Hyponatremia: The patient's history and physical exam was
consistent with volume depletion, with Na of 107.  Following
hydration, the Na did not entirely correct, indicating a
possible component of SIADH secondary to COPD and recent PNA.
In addition, the patient had recently been on steroids and there
was concern for adrenal insufficiency.  The final diagnosis is a
combination of dehydration, SIADH, and adrenal insufficiency.
Resolved with hydration and steroids.
.
# Adrenal Insufficiency:  Per Endocrinology, recent Cosyntropin
stimulation testing revealed a mildly suppressed
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with a low baseline
cortisol level and an insufficient response to ACTH stimulation.
This is most likely secondary to chronic inhaled steroid
therapy, though recent treatment with Prednisone (last given on
[**2195-8-4**]) may have contributed. The presenting symptoms of
nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and hyponatremia were considered
to be partially due to this insufficiency.  He was treated with
hydrocortisone at tapering doses.  He was discharged with
instructions to take hydrocortisone 20 mg qam and 10 mg qpm.  He
was also given a script for 100 mg im, in case he is unable to
take po doses.  He will follow-up in the [**Hospital 6091**] clinic on
[**9-9**].
.
# COPD: Severe, with home O2 requirement and use of multiple
nebs. No exacerbation during this admission.  During the
admission, the patient did not have an increased O2 requirement.
 Home regimen continued.  His oxygen saturation with ambulation
dropped to 80%, though he was not dyspneic.  His serum
bicarbonate level rose to 39, though his venous pH was 7.35.
.
# A-Fib: AICD in place. Chronically on coumadin with INR 1.5 on
admission. EKG shows he is ventricularly paced, no ischemic
changes.  Coumadin was continued through his stay and his INR
was therapeutic at the time of discharge.  Home amiodarone and
digoxin were continued.  He did have an episode of higher rates,
for which diltiazem 30 mg po q6h was started.  As his HRs
remained stable during the rest of the admission, diltiazem was
stopped at the time of discharge, to avoid excessive nodal
blockade and interaction with other medications.
.
# CAD
# CHF, chronic, systolic: No sign of volume overload on exam or
CXR.  His home furosemide was initially held, then restarted.
His weight at the time of discharge was 127.5 lbs.  He is not on
a beta blocker.  His [**Last Name (un) **] has been held recently due to relative
hypotension.

He had frequent PVCs and NSVT, including a 19 beat run of NSVT
(asymptomatic).  Electrolyte levels were normal.  Cardiac
biomarkers were negative.  These runs were likely from
myocardial scar.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: continued statin
.
# Anemia: Hct was stable during this admission, though has been
lower recently than previously.  Defer further work-up to
outpatient setting with PCP.
