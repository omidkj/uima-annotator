History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year old woman with a history of COPD on
home O2 2-4LNC, bronchiechtasis with multiple recurrent
pneumonias, dCHF, a fib not on coumadin, AS s/p balloon
valvuloplasty who presents with acute shortness of breath and
[**Known lastname **] with green/yellow sputum. Of note, she was recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (2) 111100**] for acute dCHF, acute COPD
and treated with diuresis and steroids with improvement in her
symptoms. She grew pan-resistant pseudamonas but was thought to
be a colonizer per ID c/s. She was discharged on a long steroid
taper, starting at prednisone 5 daily x 1 week, followed by
prednisone 2.5 daily x 1 week, then to stop. She was still
taking 5 a day when her symtptoms began 3 days prior to
presentation. She first noted increasing [**Date range (2) **] with heavy
green/yellow sputum that was new. She also noted associated
dyspnea worsening with the [**Date range (2) **]. Within 1-2 days prior to
presentation she noticed increasing wheezing, orthopnea, mild
weight gain (4lbs from 266->270lbs in 24 hours), pedal edema.
She also complained of generalized malaise and weakness. Due to
this constellation of symptoms, she decided to come to the ED
for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were 99  131/99  100  18  94%3L.
She was thought to be in hypercarbic respiratory failure
requiring bipap with her initial ABG 7.33/79/181. Repeat 1 hr
after bipap trial was 7.42.60/174 while on 2LNC. She was given 2
doses of albuterol nebulizer without clear improvement in her
symptoms, but it did lead to thick yellow sputum clearance. Her
pressures remained in the 90s/40s while on bipap. After bipap
her pressures improved and she was given lasix 40mg IV ONCE for
presumed pulmonary edema. She made approximately 300cc of urine
after this bolus. She had a foley and 1 20 gauge IV placed. Her
last set of vitals were 98.6  95  100/50  26  96%2LNC.
.
In the MICU, she continued to have a heavy [**Date range (2) **] with heavy
secretions and remained mildly dyspneic and mildly tachypneic.
She also became hypotensive to the high 70s/40s, which responded
to a 250cc bolus. She was started on vancomcyin, meropenem for
HAP treatment, hydrocortisone for mild COPD flare and relative
adrenal insufficiency, and kayaxalate for hyperkalemia. Bipap
was started overnight for her known OSA.
.

Past Medical History:
 Asthma: (since childhood)/COPD s/p multiple intubations: 2L NC
(since [**2172**]) at baseline for spO2 91-95%, last PFT ~1 yr ago
at OSH, trach previously suggested but pt refused
- OSA: sleep study in [**2187**], recommended CPAP but has not
tolerated it well, unclear how compliant since last discharge
(made some progress on the fit of the mask). Of note, overnight
oximetry "better than expected" when measured at rehab --> now
100% adherance to CPAP at home
- Bronchiectasis: Grows panresistant pseudamonas last admission
[**Date range (2) 111100**] thought to be colonizer
- GERD
- Anemia (history of GI bleeding many years ago)
- Leukopenia, long standing, unclear etiology
- Hyperglycemia when previously on prednisone
- Diastolic heart failure, LVEF > 55%, [**8-/2197**]
- Aortic stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2 cm^2)  -->ballooned in
[**4-/2198**] and again in [**8-/2198**] while intubated for respiratory
failure
- Moderate to severe pulmonary HTN, PCWP > 18
- Atrial fibrillation (on dilt + beta blocker), no
anticoagulation due to questionable history of GI bleeding
- Acute on chronic respiratory failure with intubation in [**8-/2198**]
during which she had balloon valvuloplasty for severe AS and
started workup for TAVI vs surgical AVR, was treated for
resistant Pseudomonas PNA

Social History:
-Smoking/Tobacco: quit smoking in [**2172**] (20 pack years)
-EtOH: None
-Illicits: None
-Lives at/with: sister (a nurse) in [**Name (NI) 4628**], was in rehab until

complication, has a daughter who's a CNA.
-Retired manager of a medical answering services
