Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, pulmonary edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CVVHD, hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 67 male well known to me, with h/o CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF
30%) ESRD on HD, COPD, Chronic Afib who was transferred NH with
pulmonary edema and hypotension; also found to be in Atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.

Mr. [**Known lastname 37564**] was noted to be dyspneic on the afternoon of
admission. O2 sats were found to be 76% on RA and 80% on a NRB.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was noted to be in Afib in rvr to
140-160 and BP was in mid 70s/20s. CXR was consistant with
pulmonary edema. He was given diltiazem, lasix 100iv in the ED.
He was then attempted on BiPAP, however he was unable to
tolerate it. He was then admitted to the ICU for CVVH.
Additionally, he required pressor support of levophed and
dopamine which were weaned off. Pt had intermittent episodes of
rapid a fib which were controlled with IV beta blockers.

While in the ICU in the am of [**4-20**], pt had an episode of
coffee-ground emesis. NG lavage was negative. INR was noted to
be 10.8. His INR was reversed with FFP and vitamin K was given.
GI consulted and said that scoping at this point was not
recommended as pt had recent hypotension, a stable Hct, and no
frank blood on lavage.

Additionally, pt with rising WBC to 31.5 on [**2191-4-20**] from an
initial WBC of 14. ? of infiltrate on CXR. Initially started on
vanc/levo/flagyl ([**2191-4-19**]) for possible pneumonia. CVVH and
dopamine d/cd [**2191-4-21**].

Pt was on transferred to the floor and had signs and symptoms
consistant with stroke. MRI revealed a small ischemic stroke in
the corona radiata on the left. Pressures were kept ~100 as
there was a tight balance between rate control and pressure
control. On [**2191-4-25**] pt went to HD. Pressures were in the 80s
systolic and he did not tolerate it and was not stable to UF.
His pulse went to the 130s and it came down to ~100 with 5 IV
metoprolol. Cardiology was consulted and we loaded pt with
digoxin (1 gram). Pt was transferred to the MICU for possible
CVVH with pressor support. He was stable overnight in the unit,
received no intervention, and was transferred back to the
medicine team now.

Radiology:
Chest AP [**2191-4-19**]-IMPRESSION: Mild worsening of congestive heart
failure with small bilateral pleural effusions. No definite
underlying consolidation is identified; however, if pneumonia is
suspected, followup films may be helpful.

MR head [**2191-4-23**]-FINDINGS: On diffusion images, a small area of
hyperintense signal is seen within the left corona radiata,
which could represent an acute subcortical infarct. Moderate to
severe brain atrophy is noted. Increased signal is seen in the
periventricular white matter due to small vessel disease.

IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited study secondary to motion. Small
area of hyperintense signal seen on diffusion images in the left
corona radiata could represent a small acute infarct. Moderate
to severe changes of small vessel disease and brain atrophy.

Echo [**2191-4-26**]-The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. No definite left ventricular
thrombus is seen (images suboptimal). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is minimal aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
67M DM2, HTN, COPD, PVD, CAD s/p CABG, CHF, ESRD on HD admitted
for hypoxia, and a. fib in rapid ventricular response with
resultant hypotension. Also found to have ? pneumonia and with
episode of hematemesis in MICU. Pt has CHF in the setting of
ESRD and and likely rapid a. fib as well. [**Date range (1) 61736**]/05- [**2191-4-27**] pt
with 18 s (49 beat run VT), Asx. [**2191-4-28**] pt febrile, tachypnic
without hypoxia. tachypnea was likely [**12-22**] fever. He did have a
resp alkalosis with increase of Aa gradient. Received tylenol PR
and Mg 2 g. Fever from likely line infection (started on zosyn
and vanc) with cultures.

1. CV
a. [**Name (NI) 4964**] Pt was in frank overload upon admission to the ICU. He
was on CVVH in the ICU as above. Echo done showed an EF of 20%
with RV and LV hypokinesis. Pt's CHF was handled by dialysis. He
initially did not tolerate it secondary to fluctuation of
pressures and hypotention. He improved when his rate improved
(See below) and he handled dialysis until he decided that he not
longer wished to have it (see below)

b. [**Name (NI) 2694**] Pt with CAD s/p CABG. We continued ASA, beta
blocker, and statin. His enzymes were negative here.

c. [**Name (NI) 9520**] Pt came in in rapid a. fib with rapid ventricular
response with possible flash. He remained in atrial
fibrillation. MR. [**Known lastname 37564**] was initially on metoprolol 50 tid
for rate control but BPs were tenous and lead to hypotension. He
was digoxin loaded IV but levels reached 3.4 on HD 9. He had a
49 beat run of Vtach during that time but no evidence of EKG
changes. His levels slowly drifted down. During the initial
loading of digoxin, his rate slowed down to the 90s-100 and BP
improved dramatically to 100-110 systolic.

2. Fever/Leukocytosis/Fungemia-
a. [**Name (NI) 25933**] Pt spiked 101.3 on HD #10 and had a leukocytosis. CXR
was clear. Pt was tender in suprapubic region, refusing straight
cath, and Ab CT. We started pt empirically on Vanc (dosed by
level <15) and Zosyn with negative cultures. We d/cd the zosyn
but were treating what we thought
