History of Present Illness:
81 y/o Spanish only speaking man with PMhx of DM, CAD, poorly
controlled HTN, diastolic HF and aortic stenosis who presented
[**8-28**] with HA and chest pain after being non-compliant with BP
meds for last 24-48hrs (he states was unable to get rx filled at
time of discharge). Of note, pt was discharged on [**2157-8-26**] after
admission hypertensive urgency, c/b bp lability prompting w/u
that is still pending. He a headache in the evening [**2157-8-27**] with
worsening chest pressure at which time, he took his BP and
decided to come to the ED because it was very high.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.3 P 85 BP 230/130 R 24 Sats
100% on RA O2. There was difficulty obtaining IV access and pt
was initially treated with oral home regimen including Losartan
100mg, Carvedilol 25mg, Hydralazine 37.5mg and Percocet x 2. SBP
initially responded coming down to 180s but rebounded quickly to
240s. CVL was placed in the left IJ and pt was started on a
nitro gtt. EKG was essentially unchanged, CT head without ICH
and CXR without pulm edema. Nitro gtt was maxed out with minimal
change in BP and pt was started on labetalol gtt (nitro weaned
off). In the ICU his labetolol gtt was weaned off on [**8-29**] and he
was resumed on his home medications. His BP [**8-30**] was 120-170 but
increased at night to 211/98 associated with some agitation
(though fully oriented). He was given hydralazine 10mg iv with
improvement in his blood pressure to 170. He continues to have a
HA ([**8-29**]) but denies chest pressure, sob, palpitations, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain. His vision is at baseline. He notes
diarrhea (non-bloody) in the icu ([**2-22**] BM's/day). He denies
fevers. Also of note in the icu on [**8-28**] he had aggitation with
paranoia requiring restraints, 3mg iv ativan and 10mg iv haldol.
Psychiatry was consulted and thought he was acutely delerious
due to hypertension and that withdrawal for etoh was very
unlikely.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo man with labile poorly controlled hypertension admitted
with hypertensive emergency, delirium, CAD, diastolic heart
failure, seizure d/o, DM and anxiety/depression.

1. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient has admitted with
systolic's >>200's. He was initially admitted to the ICU where
BP control was attempted. Secondary causes were considered.
Once the BP was in better control, the patient transferred to
floor.  On occasion, the SBP would be in 120's when patient was
resting, but it was noticed that the patient's mood plays a
significant role in raising the SBP to >210's. Without
significant medical intervention, the systolics could
spontaneously drop back down to 120's.

We determined that this patient has severe anxiety and
depression.  One of the practices that he does at home is check
his BP >30x/day and when he notices that it is high, his
pressure increases... then it is self-escalating.  These
psychiatric issues also lead him to having poor sleep and thus
further exacerbates his BP.  We found that it was very important
to use Spanish interpreters frequently when interacting with
him.

2. Anxiety/Depression: Psychiatry consulted during admission.
They assisted with recommendations on how to manage these issues
while avoiding delirium from benzodiazapine use.  These issues
are deeply ingrained and will require further outpatient
management.  The patient is also dealing with significant home
stressors---his geriatric wife has cancer, one of his sons was
killed in an accident, another son is an alcoholic, etc...

3. CAD, native vessel: continue aspirin, [**Last Name (un) **], bb, statin.

4. Chronic diastolic heart failure, not exacerbated: continue
antihypertensive regimen as above, monitor for pulmonary edema.

5. Seizure Disorder: Stable, his last seizure was in [**2138**].
Continued his home Carbamazepine 300mg [**Hospital1 **] and lyrica 100mg TID.

6. Afib/Flutter: Continue BB, aspirin. He is not anticoagulated
at baseline due to fall risk and lack of compliance.

7. Diabetes mellitus, type II, without complications: Restart
metformin, continue ssi with qid bg checks and dm diet, on
aspirin, [**Last Name (un) **].

8. OSA: treat with cpap in house.

9. PUD: continue ranitidine.

10. Dispo: He will be discharged home with several services:
Nursing, Physical Therapy, Social Work, and whatever Psych
services are available.
