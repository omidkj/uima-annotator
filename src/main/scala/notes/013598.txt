History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 78 yo female with PMHx of a-fib, hypertension,
benign bladder tumor presenting with light-headedness and
bradycardia.  It began on [**7-13**] when patient first noticed
symptoms.  She was placed on KOH monitor the following week,
which captured an abnormal rhythm.  In addition, this AM, she
woke up dizzy with a pulse she measured to be 38.  Daughter was
called, captured event on KOH and brought patient to ED after
talking to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Captured event was a junctional
rhythm.  Patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath,
headaches, syncope, fever, chills.
.
In the ED vitals were HR 50, RR 17, BP 138/34, Sa02 of 95%.
Patient was stable.  Developed some nausea after receiving
atropine- was given zofran and ativan.  Nausea subsided and
patient's anxiety was relieved.  She was given dopamine 10mg in
ED which converted her back to sinus rhythm.  Attempt was made
to wean patient off dopamine but she converted back into
junctional rhythm.  Dopamine restarted and patient returned to
sinus rhythm.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was sleeping.  Comfortable.
Still in sinus rhythm with HR of 58.  SBP of 138.  Satting at
92% on 2L NC.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope.  Reports light-headedness
and dizziness.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78 year old female with a-fib, aortic stenosis,
hypertension who presented with light-headedness and symptomatic
junctional rhythm which required pacemaker placement.
.
# RHYTHM:  History of paroxysmal a-fib/flutter/tachy.  Admitted
for symptomatic (light-headed) junctional rhythm.
Hemodynamically stable.  Initially started on dopamine 10mcg in
ED.  Converted to sinus rhythm.  Attempted to stop dopamine but
she went back into junctional rhythm.  Was seen by cardiology
fellow on admission.  Patient was placed on telemetry and
maintained on dopamine 10mcg on arrival to CCU.
That night, she had prolonged pauses on tele ranging from
2.83-3.11 seconds but remained asymptomatic.  Increased dopamine
to 15mcg/min.  BP elevated (SBP in 170s).  Gave 50mg PO
hydralazine (home dose) and checked pressure before increasing
dop
