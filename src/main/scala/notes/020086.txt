HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:    This is a 77-year-old male
with a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure on
hemodialysis, sent from [**Location (un) **] Dialysis Center for change
in mental status.

Nephrocaps one once daily, Zestril 20 mg twice a day, RenaGel
2400 three times a day, Niferex 150 once daily,
enteric-coated aspirin  one once daily, Tums one twice a day,
Cardizem 180 once daily, Lopressor 100 once daily, Zyprexa 10
twice a day.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was stable, and his only symptoms in the
temperature of 102.1, and mild hyperkalemia with a potassium
of 6.0.  He was worked up for fever.  Urinalysis was
negative.  Blood cultures and chest x-ray were negative.  CT
of the abdomen showed colitis in the right lower quadrant vs.
ischemic bowel.  The patient was started on Flagyl and
levofloxacin.CXR also suggested possible RML infiltrate.

A head CT and right hip film were performed, as the patient
was found next to his bed a week or two ago, confused.  Both
of these were negative.  The patient's white count decreased
over time, and he remained afebrile.  The levofloxacin 250
every other day and Flagyl 500 by mouth three times a day
seemed to be having some effect, though the source of the
patient's colitis remained unidentified.

On [**8-11**], about one hour after hemodialysis, the patient
had a large lower gastrointestinal bleed with bright red
blood per rectum.  Mental status, when evaluated, was
baseline.  Blood pressure was 100 to 110 systolic, when it
had been running 150 to 180 systolic.  Heart rate was now in
the 60s to 80s.  Intravenous fluids were started at 200
cc/hour.  A 16 gauge intravenous was placed in the left
medial aspect of the left leg.  Nasogastric lavage was
negative for blood or coffee grounds.  Hematocrit decreased
from 35 to 33, and the patient was transfused two units of
blood in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  A tagged red blood
cell scan was performed, which showed diffuse blood in the
cecum.

While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was
hypertensive and had a labetalol drip.  When he returned to
the floor, he was started on Zestril 40 twice a day, and
Toprol XL 100 once daily, as well as Cardizem.  Further
gastrointestinal workup was postponed according to
Gastroenterology consult, as this was felt to be addressable
as an outpatient by colonoscopy in a few weeks' time.

All of the patient's medications which could affect mental
status were held, including Haldol, Benadryl, and he became
more clear over time.  The aspect of delirium which seemed to
be present before was no longer there, and it seemed the
patient had a baseline dementia which was now unmasked.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had a conversation with the family, which
resulted in the patient having Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not
Intubate status, and the family agreed that the patient
should have long-term care due to dementia and chronic gait
instability. He completed his 14 day course
of levofloxacin and Flagyl.
He was seen by Physical Therapy
and Occupational Therapy and Speech and Swallow due to concerns
about aspiration risk. Pt had video swallow which showed delayed
oropharyngeal clearing without evidence of aspiration. Pt has
difficluties with pills so advised to crush these and put in
pureed foods.
Pt is to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25316**] of Gastroenterology for an outpatient
colonoscopy in two or three weeks' time.
He is also to f/u with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 805**] for renal and primary
care within the next few weeks.
Pt also has type 2 Diabetes. He came in on insulin regimen. In
house he had a few episodes of hypoglycemia. His standing

rare requirement for insulin. Woudl maintain on sliding scale of
insulin and re-start insulin only if sugars trend upward with
improvment in diet.
