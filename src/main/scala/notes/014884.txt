Chief Complaint:
Hypoxemia, altered mental status

Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10145**] is an 86 y/o F with PMH COPD and ulcerative colitis
a/w with worsening dyspnea and hypoxia at [**Hospital3 **]
home.  According to reports from the nursing home she was noted
to have worsening dyspnea with O2 saturation of 86% on room air.
 She had a chest xray that did not show any evidence of
infiltrate.  Pt reported fall at nursing home, however staff
present and denied fall.  V/S prior to transfer 86% RA -> 93%
2L, BP 97.8 130/74 HR 64, RR 20.

Of note, she had a recent admission from [**2156-4-23**] - [**2156-4-29**] for
ulcerative colitis flare and C.diff. She was discharged on
Vancomycin 250 mgPO Q6H for 14 days.

In the ED VS T98.1 HR 113 BP 150/58 RR 40 99% NRB.  She was
given solu medrol 125mg IV, duoneb x3.  She had ABG showing
hypercarbia and acidosis and was cocnerned that becoming
progressively tachypnic with increased work of breathing. She
had a CTA to r/o PE which did not show any evidence of pulmonary
embolism or pneumonia.  She was initially sedated with propfol
after intubation and became hypotensive to 80's / 40, given IV
bolus, switched to Versed IV which also caused hypotension.  She
was given total of 2L NS.

.
[**2156-5-24**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 125 bpm, occasional PAC's, poor
baseline, normal axis, normal intervals, no ST segment or T wave
changes
.
Imaging:
[**2156-5-24**] CXR (prelim) - ET tube 5cm above carina, NGT coiled in
stomach, hyperinflation bilaterally with flattening of
diaphragms, no evidence of frank consolidation or effusion.
.
[**2156-5-24**] Abd Xray (prelim) - limited, poor quality exam,
non-diagnostic for free air.
.
[**2156-5-24**] CXR (prelim) hyperinflated, flattening of diaphragms c/w
copd, lucency below L hemidiaphragm, density at Left lung base
suggestive of infection
.
[**2156-5-24**] CTA (prelim): No PE or evidence of PNA. Likely Azygous
continuation of IVC, although IVC obstuction cannot be excluded.


[**5-25**] TTE - The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is trivial functional mitral stenosis (mean
gradient 3 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

         PRESUMPTIVE IDENTIFICATION.


Brief Hospital Course:
#Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Secondary to COPD
exacerbation in the setting of URI or pneumonia with a lesser
component of pulmonary edema. A TTE was performed on [**5-25**] to
evaluate cardiac function in light of a concern for volume
overload, which showed moderate pulmonary HTN and preserved
biventricular systolic function. The patient was treated with
mechanical ventilation, prednisone taper, antibiotics, and
diuretics. Respiratory status improved with these therapies and
the patient was extubated on [**5-30**] to non-invasive ventilation.
.
#UTI - E. Coli was isolated from a urine culture on [**2156-5-26**] and
she was treated with meropenem for 7 days.
.
#C. diff colitis - Oral vancomycin was continued and the patient
was placed on contact precautions.
.
#Ulcerative Colitis- Outpatient balsalazide and mesalamine were
continued.
.
#Nutrition - Patient was given tube feeds while intubated.

#Prophylaxis - The patient was given SQH, a PPI, and a bowel
regimen.
.
#Prior to extubation, the issue of code status was readdressed
with the patient's daughter. The patient's overall prognosis was
discussed and it was decided that she would not be reintubated.
Following extubation, the patient was increasingly uncomfortable
and tachypneic with a rising oxygen requirement. Her family
eventually decided to make the patient CMO and she was treated
with a morphine infusion titrated to comfort. She passed away on
[**2156-6-2**]. Her family declined a post-mortem examination.
