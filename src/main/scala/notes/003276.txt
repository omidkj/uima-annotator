Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 21214**] is a [**Age over 90 **]F with recent confusion and URI found to
have PE on CT in ED.  Pt was seen by her PCP today for followup
of her recent hyponatremia.  Pt's chronic venous stasis and leg
ulcerations were thought to look worse and possibly be infected,
so she was sent to the ED for further evaluation.  There, her O2
sat dropped into 60s during her stay.  A CXR was performed,
which showed RLL collapse, and a CTA showed 2 large PEs in the R
main pulmonary artery.
.
Pt denies SOB or chest pain.  She states she is feeling
comfortable.  She does not remember being in the ED earlier
today.  She does not believe she is in [**Location (un) 86**].
.
On further questioning of pt's son, he states that she had a
recent URI, as did her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] states that pt has been
talking to herself more frequently at night over the last [**3-16**]
days and has been more confused.  She is usually oriented and
sharp, and she has been confused and rambling.  Her PCP notes
this from their visit today, as well.  [**Name (NI) 1094**] son does not recall
pt complaining of SOB or chest pain.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt rec'd D50 and insulin, 2 amps bicarb, Kayexalate,
and Unasyn 3g x1.  Heparin gtt started after CT angio results
returned.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 21214**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a h/o afib
admitted for PE and RLL PNA.

# PE: She had been on coumadin chronically but became
supertherapeutic so her coumadin was held.  On admission her INR
was 1.7 and CTA showed large acute pulmonary emboli in her right
main pulmonary artery.  She was initially transferred to the
MICU and put on a heparin gtt.  Her respiratory status remained
stable and then trasferred to Medicine for futher care.  She was
transitioned to coumadin with a 2 day overlap with heparin when
the INR was therapeutic between 2 and 3.  She is discharged with
coumadin 2mg daily, and she should have her INR monitored
frequently and coumadin adjusted accordingly.  She did not
develop any bleeding complications.
.
# PNA: CXR showed RLL collapse, suggestive of a post-obstructive
PNA.  In the MICU,s he was covered emperically with ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, and unasyn.  Then her antibiotic regimen was later
changed to azithromycin (for CAP) and Zosyn (for coverage of
aspiration pneumonia).  Her respiratory status was stable on
nasal cannula.  She completed a 5 day course of azithromycin.
She will complete a 14 day course of zosyn upon discharge, last
date [**2132-2-15**].  Vancomycin was added to cover for potential MRSA,
and she will complete a 10 day course also on [**2132-2-15**].  She has a
PICC line in for access.  For her Vanc, she is dosed 1000mg q48
hours based on her renal function at this time.  She should have
her dose adjusted while in rehab.  She was given xopenex for
bronchodilation; albuterol should be avoided as she is
tachycardic.  Atrovent was avoided because of anticholinergic
effects, which may cause some mental status change.
.
# DELIRIUM: Likely secondary to infectious process (PNA) and
hospitalization in the elderly.  She is not on any medication
that would incite mental status decline.  She is not hypoxic,
and had an unremarkable ABG here.  She had head CT that was
negative for bleed.  Her mental status improved over her
hospital course.  She should avoid narcotics and sedative
including sleeping aids at night.
.
# ABD XRAY: She had a KUB that showed possible ileus.  However,
she was eating without symptoms and she had loose stools.  She
should have a follow up KUB to assess if this has resolved.  Her
loose stools were negative for cdiff x 2.  She was on flagyl
emperically briefly but this was discontinued since she has 2
sets negative.
.
# AFIB: She is rate controlled with metoprolol 50mg tid.  She is
on coumadin for anticoagulation.
.
# VENOUS STASIS ULCERS:  She initially presented from PCP's
office because her venous ulcers look infected.  These improved
on both legs with wound care consult.  She should have dry guage
changes [**Hospital1 **], wrapped with kerlex.  Of note, she looses
significant fluids from these ulcers so she might need fluid
replacement.
.
# ELBOW ULCER:  She has a pressure ulcer on her right elbow that
does not look infected.  This should be treated with guage and
kerlex.
.
# ARF: She does not have baseline renal disease.  Urine lytes
and FENA suggested a prerenal picture.  Her lisinopril was held
in this setting.  She was given gentle IVF's but she still has
some renal insufficiency.  She will continue to need IVF at
rehab.  Renal ultrasound was unremarkable.
.
# CYANOTIC RIGHT HAND: Arterial study was normal arterial blood
flow and and ultrasound did not show DVT in her right arm.
.
# NUTRITION: She tolerates a regular cardiac diet with
supplemental Ensure TID.  Her albumin is 2.2 so she is has
severe malnutrition.  Would continue to enourage PO intake.
.
# CODE: DNR/DNI as discussed with pt's PCP
