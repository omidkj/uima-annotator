Service:  Thoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49-year-old man
with a history of esophageal cancer first diagnosed in [**2194-5-2**] status post chemotherapy and radiation, who underwent an
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy on [**2194-11-13**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] at this
institution.  Since that operation, the patient's
postoperative course has been complicated by a
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus wound infection,
wound dehiscence, and creation of a fistula and diversion
after breakdown of his anastomosis.  The patient had a
prolonged hospital stay at that time, but recovered and was
discharged to rehabilitation.  While at rehabilitation the
patient continued on his long-term vancomycin therapy, which
was completed on [**2195-1-21**].  On that date, the patient began
to experience fever and mental status changes, and was
transferred to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital, where he was found to
be frankly septic.  Once the patient's history was known, he
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**]
for further work-up.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon presentation at our facility the
patient was found to be frankly septic, in need of blood
products, which were given.  The patient required near
immediate intubation, which was undertaken.  Extensive
work-up of the patient included CT scan of his abdomen and
chest, magnetic resonance imaging scan of his abdomen,
bronchoscopy and multiple cultures, revealing that the
patient was floridly septic, although a discrete source was
not clearly identified.

The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics,
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  The patient's fistula
was found to be draining frank pus, although no discrete
drainable fluid collection was found in his chest.

Over the next few days the patient remained in the intensive
care unit intubated, in extremely serious condition, not
improving on his antibiotics.  Discussions were undertaken
with the family and he was made DNR, and the decision was
made to transfuse no new blood products and to start no
pressors.  The patient's white count continued to rise.  He
was found to be in disseminated intravascular coagulation and
appeared to be having liver failure.  His blood gases
demonstrated that he was persistently severely acidotic.

The patient's course continued to deteriorate and on the
morning of [**2195-1-30**] the patient was found to still be
spiking fevers, was hemodynamically unstable, and to be in
severe disseminated intravascular coagulation.  The patient
succumbed and was pronounced dead at 10:45 AM on [**2195-1-30**].  The family was notified of the death, as well as the
attending surgeon, and consent was obtained for a postmortem
examination.
