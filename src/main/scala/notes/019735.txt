Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
69 M with PMH significant for COPD who initially presented to
[**Hospital3 **] on [**2179-4-16**] with chest pain and shortness of
breath. He is originally from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 14966**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NY and came to the
[**Location (un) 3320**] area for a fishing trip with his wife two days ago.
According to his wife, his respiratory problems go back over the
last 1-2 years. He was diagnosed with COPD and told to use
intermittent advair and oxygen at night. He was stable until the
previous few days when he was having sore throat, cough
productive of white sputum, and increased dyspnea. He went to
his family doctor and was prescribed a Z-pack, which he
completed without much imporovement in his respiratory symptoms.
He admitted occasional subjective fevers, but no chills, had
more trouble breathing at night, and felt better sitting on edge
of the bed, but did not wish to use more than 1 pillow at night.
He has also noted some increasing ankle edema over the last few
days. Normally, he is physically active and able to maintain his
farm with horses, dogs, cats, chickens, and rabbits without
difficulty.
.
While on the fishing boat, he had worsening dyspnea and chest
pressure, and was sent by EMS to [**Hospital3 **]. His chest
pressure improved with nitro, morphine, and aspirin. EKG
appeared to have no ischemic changes. They gave 20 IV lasix and
started heparin drip in the ED before transfer. He arrived at
[**Hospital1 18**] satting in the 80's on room air, and improved to 93% on 2L
NC. Given his somnolence, an ABG was done which showed
7.25/94/45/47. CXR was felt to be consistent with failure,
though official read was "clear", and he was given 20 IV lasix,
resulting in 1500mL out. EKG was done which showed no acute
changes. BNP was 209. He was admitted to the MICU for concern of
respiratory failure and potential requirement of mechanical
ventilation.
.
In the MICU, he was maintained on BiPap with good results, and
was able to be weaned down to 2L NC by the time of transfer to
the floor. He was treated with SoluMedrol 125mg IV q8h, Advair,
Spiriva, and albuterol nebs for presumed COPD exacerbation. He
had a non-contrast chest CT, which demonstrated diffuse patchy
bilateral ground opacities and interlobular septal thickening,
and moderate bilateral layering pleural effusions with
atelectasis. No consolidations were seen. This AM, he was
satting well on 2L and feeling "100% better." His AM ABG was
7.38/65/78, with bicarb 42. He was called out to the floor for
further management.


Past Medical History:
hypertension
COPD - on home o2 at night for "oxygen deficiency" since 1 year
ago
left hip replacement [**2168**] - horse accident


Social History:
Smoked 1 PPD x 40 years, quit 10 years ago. He lives in [**State 531**]
with his wife on a small farm with horses, dogs, cats, chickens,
and rabbits. [**Name2 (NI) **] denies drinking or illicit drug use.

Pertinent Results:
CXR:
hazy left lower area with slight cephalization of vessels. left
CP angle clear, right not visualized. (Though officially read as
no pna or CHF)
.
Chest CT (same day as CXR):
FINDINGS: There are diffuse patchy ground-glass opacifications
within both lung fields. Interlobular septal thickening is
present. There is no focal consolidation. There are
moderate-sized bilateral layering pleural effusions with
associated atelectasis. The bronchi and trachea are patent. No
significant bullae are seen. Numerous small lymph nodes are seen
scattered throughout the mediastinum, the largest being a 9-mm
subcarinal lymph node. Coronary calcifications are present. The
heart, pericardium, and great vessels are otherwise unremarkable
on this non-contrast-enhanced examination. Imaged upper abdomen
is unremarkable. Degenerative changes are seen throughout the
thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. Patchy ground-glass opacifications, interlobular septal
thickening and bilateral pleural effusions, all indicative of
pulmonary edema. No focal bullae or consolidation. There are
coronary calcifications.

INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size,
and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function. TVI E/e' >15,
suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. False LV tendon (normal variant).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened aortic
valve
leaflets. Minimally increased gradient c/w minimal AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Based on [**2169**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis
recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk
(prophylaxis not recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the
need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
echocardiographic data.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Tissue velocity
imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Minimal aortic stenosis. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Based on [**2169**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be
based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
