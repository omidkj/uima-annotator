HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57-year-old man with
past medical history significant for recurrent pancreatitis
with pancreatic ductal stricture, hypertension, increased
cholesterol, peripheral vascular disease admitted for distal
pancreatectomy and splenectomy for presence of pancreatic
mass.  Patient is a man, who in the past has been in overall
poor health, who has had 7-8 episodes of pancreatitis
requiring hospitalization since [**2125-1-21**].  During
this time he would be in the hospital for 3-4 days, go home
and eat, and return with pain shortly thereafter.  Upon
imaging by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], a stricture was identified in the
distal pancreatic duct, which was temporarily treated with a
stent.  The stent was left in place for a period of time and
then was removed.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Atenolol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Clonidine 0.2 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Neurontin 400  mg p.o. q.i.d.
4. Hydralazine.
5. Lopid.
6. Imipramine.
7. Darvocet.
8. Dilaudid.
9. Aspirin.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.8, heart
rate 86, blood pressure 164/84, respiratory rate 23, and
patient was 99 percent on room air.  Patient was noted to be
in no apparent distress and to be comfortable.  Heart was a
regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes,
rales, or rhonchi.  Abdomen was soft, nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds, it was nontender.  Neurologically,
patient was within normal limits throughout.  Patient has
incisions in the neck, abdomen, and legs.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Thus, the patient at this time was admitted
to [**Hospital1 69**] for surgical
treatment of this likely mass in the tail of the pancreas.
CTA showed pancreatic tail mass that had been increasing in
size near the tail of the pancreas.  The plan at this time
was for likely distal pancreatectomy and possible
splenectomy.  Patient was prepared properly in the
preoperative period and was noted to be of small risk for
this procedure.  Laboratory values were within normal limits
at this time, and the patient was brought to the operating
room for distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy.  After
extensive lysis of adhesions in the operating room, the
splenic artery was suture ligated.  The pancreas and splenic
vein were divided with a TA stapler and oversewn and the
specimen was removed.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.
Estimated blood loss was 800 cc and he received no
transfusions.

He was extubated and eventually brought to the floor.  He
received a total of three doses of Kefzol in the
perioperative period and received beta blockers both pre and
postoperatively.  Patient was hypertensive postoperatively
and on postoperative day number two, became tachycardic to
the 120s.  EKG showed ST depression in leads V2 through V5.
CK's were elevated as was his troponin.  He was started on
aspirin and transferred to a monitored setting for better
management of his heart rate and blood pressure with IV beta
blockers and nitroglycerin.  Cardiology was consulted and
played an integral part in his management.  His CK's were
trending down.  It was felt that he had completed a cardiac
event and catheterization was delayed.

On postoperative day four, he became agitated, tachypneic,
and had decreasing oxygen saturations on 100 percent FIO2.
He was intubated and a CTA was negative for pulmonary
embolism, but there was evidence of pneumonia and CHF.  He
was treated with empiric antibiotics and Lasix, and his
respiratory status improved.  Two days later he began having
diarrhea and was found to have a Clostridium difficile
infection.  He was treated with p.o. and p.r. Vancomycin as
he had an allergy to Flagyl.  He remained intubated over the
next five days, where he had fevers and an elevated white
blood cell count.  Sputum cultures grew out MRSA and he was
treated with a course of IV Vancomycin.

He was extubated for a short amount of time, but then became
agitated, tachypneic, tachycardic despite esmolol drip with
elevated blood pressure.  CK's and troponins again became
elevated and he was begun on Heparin.  Repeat echocardiogram
showed new anterior wall motion abnormalities and he was
taken for cardiac catheterization.  His catheterization
showed a right dominant system with 100 percent occlusion of
his right coronary artery and 80 percent stenosis of his left
main coronary artery, which was stented.  He was continued on
Plavix and aspirin postcatheterization and then was
eventually extubated.

He then improved from a respiratory standpoint and was
getting physical therapy on the floor, and was noted to be
progressing well during this time.  Apparently, he will
likely be discharged to rehabilitation.  During this time on
the floor, patient was also noted to have symptoms of
depression and anxiety, and Psychiatry was consulted.
Psychiatry suggestions at this time were to discharge
imipramine and to decrease his mirtazapine dose from 30 mg
q.d. to 7.5 mg q.h.s.  These two medications were implicated
by Psychiatry to be possibly causing some anticholinergic
symptoms in this patient.  Psychiatry's recommendations were
followed, and the above stated adjustments were made.

On [**2125-8-27**], the patient was noted to be stable and
to have vital signs within normal limits.  On physical exam,
to be in no apparent distress.  To be comfortable.  His heart
is regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His abdomen is
nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds and to be
nontender throughout with a well-healing wound without
drainage or erythema.  Patient's activity level at this time
also seem to be improving as he had been noted to be walking
3-5x/day in the days leading up to his discharge with his
spirits seeming to be improved.

On the day of discharge, patient had been noted to be now
tolerating a full diet for a period of two days.  Patient at
this time also received his immunizations against
pneumococcal, Hemophilus influenza B, and the meningococcal
vaccine.
