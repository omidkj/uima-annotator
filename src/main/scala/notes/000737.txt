Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
intracranial hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2114-5-17**]
1. Left-sided frontal craniotomy for resection.
2. Evacuation of hematoma.
3. Partial frontal lobotomy.

[**2114-5-23**]

2. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 67988**] is a 68 yo woman with a PMH of a left CEA 3 days
prior to admission, on aspirin 81mg daily who was transferred
from an OSH after being found down by her husband in the
bathroom with urinary and fecal incontinence. She was taken to
an OSH, where she had a witnessed seizure and was intubated.
Noncontrast head CT demonstrated a large left frontal
intracranial hemorrhage. Her INR was less than one and her
platelets were 248. She loaded with dilantin and given Vit K and
4 units of FFP prior to being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

Per OSH operative note from [**2114-5-15**], patient underwent L CEA
with EEG monitoring, arteriotomy of ulcerated plaque with bovine
pericardial patch for an asymptomatic critical left ICA stenosis
(>80%) in setting of right ICA occlusion.  Prior work-up over
past 6 months included initial US showing right occlusion and
left >80%.  Then CT angiogram in [**9-23**] with R occlusion and
critical L stenosis with ulcerated web-like plaque at origin of
L ICA.

Studies:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2114-5-17**] 7:33 PM
1. Large area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right
frontal lobe, with intraventricular extension. Extensive left
greater than right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Marked mass effect locally in the left frontal lobe, and
marked rightward subfalcine herniation of greater than 1 cm. No
defninite uncal or transtentorial herniation. Slight enlargement
of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle may suggest
early ventricular entrapment.
.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2114-5-17**] 7:34 PM
1. No fracture or malalignment. Mild multilevel degenerative
change as described above.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2114-5-18**] 3:17 AM
There has been an interval left frontal craniostomy with almost
complete evacuation of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left
frontal lobe. Residual subarachnoid and intraparenchymal blood
is seen, and again a small amount of blood is seen layering in
the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle. There are
expected postoperative changes with non-tension pneumocephalus.
There is a decreased effacement of the right lateral ventricle.
Apart from the postoperative changes, no other bony
abnormalities are seen, and the mastoid air cells and visualized
portions of the paranasal sinuses are clear.
.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2114-5-19**] 10:03 PM
Left frontal resection cavity filled with fluid as well as
residual blood seen extending into the corpus callosum.
Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular blood is
again seen. No underlying enhancing lesions are identified.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2114-5-19**] 7:57 AM
Since yesterday, there is no significant interval change except
for accumulation of low-density fluid in the left frontal
pneumocephalus. There is no evidence of significant acute
re-hemorrhage. The amount and distribution of acute blood
products in the bifrontal extra-axial space, right frontal
subarachnoid space and layering in the right lateral ventricle
are stable. There is stable mass effect on the left lateral
ventricle and mild rightward subfalcine herniation of
approximately 5 mm. There is no evidence of transtentorial
herniation. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
remain well aerated.
.
EEG [**2114-5-19**]
Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the markedly suppressed
background consisting of low voltage fast activity with admixed
theta frequencies. The first finding suggests a marked
encephalopathy suggesting dysfunction of bilateral subcortical
and deep midline structures. Medications, metabolic
disturbances, and infection are among the common causes of
encephalopathy but there are others. The hemispheric asymmetry
with loss of faster frequencies over the left side suggests an
ongoing structural or destructive process affecting the left
hemisphere versus material interposed between the cortex and
skull on that side (e.g. hemorrhage). There were no epileptiform
features and no electrographic seizure activity was noted. The
low voltage fast background likely reflects medication effects
from concomitant propofol administration.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2114-5-22**] 11:27 AM
No significant change in the bifrontal intraparenchymal,
subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage with no significant change
in the mild subfalcine herniation to the right. No change in the
small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the right lateral
ventricle.
.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2114-5-28**] 3:51 PM
No evidence of DVT in both lower extremities.
.
CXR ([**5-27**]): Right subclavian catheter has been removed with no
pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position.
Lungs are clear, except for focal linear areas of atelectasis in
the left mid and retrocardiac areas.
.
CXR ([**5-31**]): Lungs volumes are low, and the heart size is top
normal. A tracheostomy tube is in standard position. There is no
evidence of effusion, consolidation, or pulmonary edema.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
