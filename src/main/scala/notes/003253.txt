Status-post arrest

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 724**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year male with past medical history of a
traumatic subdural hematoma s/p craniectomy, HTN, and afib.
Today while at his nursing home, he was noted to have
tonic-clonic movements, then collapsed on the floor. Per report
from the nursing home, no pulse was appreciated at that time.
CPR was started, and portable defibrillator pads were placed,
which advised no shock. He was reported to be asystolic. EMS
arrived approximately 3 minutes later. Intravenous access was
established and he was given 1 mg of epinephrine. The EMS team
attempted to intubated the patient, at which time zucchini was
noted in the airway above the vocal cords. This was removed and
he was intubated. CPR was continued and he was transported to
[**Hospital1 18**]. On route, he was noted to have return of spontaneous
circulation, with atrial fibrillation at a rate of 140 was
noted, with systolic blood pressure of 90.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, he was intubated, with a heart rate of
140 in atrial fibrillation and systolic blood pressure of 80.
Levophed was started. He converted into sinus before he was able
to be cardioverted, with improvement in his blood pressure. EKGs
demonstrated left axis deviation, RBBB, and ST depressions in
leads V3-V6. A right IJ was placed. He underwent a head CT which
demonstrated bilateral small collections, with possible acute
component. No trauma was apparent on examination. Neurosurgery
evaluated the patient in the ED and concluded no surgical
intervention was necessary. A chest x-ray was unremarkable and
revealed appropriate CVL and ETT placement.
.
He was started on the Arctic Sun protocol 90 minutes after
arrival and reached goal temp of 34C 150 minutes after arrival.
His granddaughter arrived to the emergency room. He was
transferred to the ICU for management.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU the patient is intubated, unresponsive,
and cooled to 34C. Fentanyl, versed, and norephinepherine drips
are running.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small mixed density bifrontal subdural collections, likely
acute on
chronic.
2. Bilateral ethmoidal mucosal thickening, left maxillary
mucosal thickening
and aerosolized secretions in the nasal cavity. Clinical
correlation
recommended.

Echo [**3-2**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is small.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
