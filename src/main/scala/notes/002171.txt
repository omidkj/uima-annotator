Chief Complaint:
Elective right heart cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Central line placement


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 27 yo man with h/o adriamycin induced
cardiomyopathy who now presents with cardiogenic shock. He was
diagnosed with AML at age 11, at which time he received
intensive chemotherapy, including adriamycin, and apparently
developed heart failure during induction. He was successfully
medically treated for many years with ACE I, and remained quite
active, playing many sports.
He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] in [**7-25**] for follow up of his
cardiomyopathy, at which time he was maintained on his ACE I and
started on a beta blocker. Holter monitoring at this time also
showed only minimal atrial and ventricular ectopy. ECHO at that
time demonstrated mildly dilated LV cavity, EF 20-25%, trivial
MR.
.
Over the past 3 weeks, the patients symtpoms have worsened. He
was in his USOH (very active, no DOE, orthopnea, etc.) until
approx 3 weeks ago when he experienced "a cough and cold".
Denies fevers during this time, but describes a non-productive
cough, + DOE with stairs mainly (becomes dyspnic w/ climbing [**12-23**]
flights of stairs), and + orthopnea. These symptoms occurred
over a 3 day period, and he had a CXR done that demonstrated CHF
- he was hospitalized three weeks ago for CHF, at which time he
was started on a diuretic (aldactone) in addition to the beta
blocker and ace inhibitor. However, since discharge he has
reported continued symptoms, inlcuding decreased appetite,
headaches, GI symptoms including loose stools, and a general
fatigue, along with continued DOE and orthopnea. He saw Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 171**] in clinic for these symptoms, at which time his systolic
blood pressure was in the 80??????s (baseline SBP 100), he was
tachycardic, and his JVP as elevated. He therefore was referred
in for a right heart catheterization.
.
Right heart catheterization performed today [**2120-4-11**] demonstrated
mixed venous of 35, CI 1.1. With milrinone mixed venous 56, CI
2.2.  Currently patient feels "fine". Denies any SOB, any other
complaints at this time.

Pertinent Results:
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2120-3-20**] demonstrated:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-7-17**],
the LV cavity appears more dilated and the mitral regurgitation
has increased.
IMPRESSION: Severe, dilated cardiomyopathy.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2120-4-11**] demonstrated:
HEMODYNAMICS:
CI: 1.05, On milrinone 2.11
.
Baseline pressures:
RA Pressure: 26
RV Pressure: 60/14
PCWP: 34
LV Presure: 98/18
LVEDP: 37
AO: 103/82
SVO2: 37%
.
Abdominal US [**2120-4-12**]:
The study is limited due to patient's clinical condition. The
liver appears homogeneous, without evidence of focal lesion. The
gallbladder is normal without evidence of gallstones. No
evidence of intra- or extra- hepatic biliary ductal dilatation,
and the common duct measures 2 mm. The main portal vein is
patient with antegrade flow. The pancreas is not visualized due
to overlying intestinal gas. The spleen is normal in size and
echogenicity. The aorta is normal in caliber throughout.
Bilateral small pleural effusions are noted.  No evidence of
free fluid within the abdomen.
.
Carotid US [**2120-4-12**]:
No plaque and no hemodynamically significant stenosis in either
carotid.
.
Chest X-ray [**2120-4-16**]:
FINDINGS:  Again noted is a Swan-Ganz catheter from a right
internal jugular approach stable in course and position with the
distal tip in the right main pulmonary artery.  The lungs remain
clear and appropriately expanded.  No effusion or pneumothorax
is evident.  Bony bridging is again evident between the left
first and second ribs.
IMPRESSION:  Stable examination with no acute pulmonary process.
 PA catheter stable in course and position.
