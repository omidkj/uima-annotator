CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2125-12-16**]
The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened,
consistent with COPD. There is moderate cardiomegaly. The
patient is status post sternotomy, with multiple mediastinal
clips. The aorta is tortuous. Doubt CHF. There is bibasilar
atelectasis. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, larger
on the right. The possibility of an infectious infiltrate at the
bases cannot be excluded. However, compared with [**2125-12-14**], there
has been interval clearing at the left and right bases.





Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34407**] was admitted and underwent routine preoperative
evaluation. He remained pain free on medical therapy and was
cleared for surgery. On [**12-12**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed
coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. For surgical details,
please see separate dictated operative note. Following the
operation, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. He maintained good hemodynamics and
restarted on low dose beta blockade. His CVICU course was
otherwise uneventful and he transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day one.   He was restarted on his home dose
Statin, and aspirin. His foley was d/c'd and he voided without
difficulty.  His pain was well controlled with Ultram and
Percocet.  He tolerated a regular diet. On POD #2 the epicardial
pacing wires were removed.  He was slowly diuresed.  He was seen
by physical therapy and deemed safe for home. He remained in
sinus rhythm and was discharge to home on POD #4.  He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] as an outpatient.
