History of Present Illness:
60 y/o M with poorly differentiated non-small cell lung CA Stage
IV metastatic to adrenals and bone who presented to [**Hospital 1281**]
Hospital on [**2121-11-11**] with complaints of weakness, nausea,
left-sided chest pain, systolic blood pressures in the 60's.
Patient noted to have a dramatic HCT drop and abdominal CT

Pertinent Results:
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2121-11-18**] 1:11 AMIMPRESSION:
1. Perihilar lung mass measuring 4.0 x 2.9 cm causing occlusion
of the lower lobe branches to the left main pulmonary artery,
narrowing of the left proximal mainstem bronchus, and post
obstructive consolidation.
2. Diffuse interstitial consolidation in the right upper lobe
and dependent consolidation in the right lower lobe with
appearance most typical for aspiration pneumonia.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, large in the left and small to
moderate in the right.
4. Diffuse metastasis to multiple ribs and the T1 vertebral
body, as well as to the left adrenal gland.
5. Large perisplenic hematoma, likely related to recent finding
of splenic artery aneurysm which is status post coiling.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.) Pulmonary: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated.
He was electively intubated at [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital prior to
bronchoscopy there and remained intubated in anticipation of
further possible intervention. After arrival, overnight he was
maintained on AC on the vent. He had a chest CT overnight which
showed
--Perihilar lung mass measuring 4.0 x 2.9 cm causing occlusion
of the lower lobe branches to the left main pulmonary artery,
narrowing of the left proximal mainstem bronchus, and post
obstructive consolidation.
--Diffuse interstitial consolidation in the right upper lobe and
dependent consolidation in the right lower lobe with appearance
most typical for aspiration pneumonia.
--Bilateral pleural effusions, large in the left and small to
moderate in the right.
--Diffuse metastasis to multiple ribs and the T1 vertebral body,
as well as to the left adrenal gland.
In the AM [**2121-11-18**] the patient had a bedside thoracentesis both
therapeutic and diagnostic analyzing his left pleural effusion.
The effusion was exudative based on the lab results (see above).
A bronchoscopy was performed and no endobronchial lesions were
seen. The bronchioles were patent and a stent was not placed.
The patient will be continued on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for the
possibility of a post-obstructive pneumonia. The results of the
pleural fluid cytology are still pending at the time of transfer
back to [**Hospital 1281**] hospital so it is unclear as to whether the
effusion was malignant(associated with lung CA) or [**1-13**]
infection. The patient was extubated on [**2121-11-19**] in the morning
without complication. He was evalutated at the bedside by Dr.
[**Name (NI) **] and the interventional pulmonary team using
ultrasound which did not reveal any reaccumulation of pleural
fluid at the thoracentesis site.

2. CV: The patient has a history of HTN. At home he takes
atenolol, this was initially held on transfer because the
patient's BP was low. On the day of extubation, the patient's BP
had normalized and he had an episode of tachycardia and
persistent HTN s/p extubation. He was restarted on his atenolol
and was given 10 mg IV hydralazine and may continue this Q6H for
today during transfer. His BP regimen may need to be readressed
at [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital

3. NSC-lung CA: The patient has significant pain related to his
mets. He was on IV morphine in the hospital. On transfer he was
written for PO morphine SR and IR.

4. Adrenal insufficiency: On transfer, the patient was on
solumedrol for presumed adrenal insufficiency. A cortisol level
was drawn here and the level was markedly high, indicating the
steroids can be tapered and removed. The patient should be
placed on PO prednisone at [**Hospital 1281**] hospital and an appropriate
taper started.

5. FEN: The patient was initially NPO for the procedure, but at
the time of discharge was restarted on a regular diet.
