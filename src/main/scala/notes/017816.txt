Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
CHF, ARF, Mediastinal lymphadenopathy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy x 2
Mediastinoscopy with lymph node biopsy

History of Present Illness:
76M initially went to [**Hospital 1562**] hospital with L flank and sent
home with narcs.  Represented with DOE, weight gain and L flank
pain.  He reports that he has had intermittent DOE for year but
notice a sharp increase in his weight over a period of 10 days.
He gained 8-10lbs with associated LE swelling, but without
medication noncompliance, dietary changes, chest pain,
orthopnea, PND.  This happened at the beginning of [**Month (only) 359**] and
his Lasix was increased from 40 to 60 daily.  He also had a
holter revealing afib (rate 40-100), nuclear stress
([**2163-11-1**])without ischemia and normal ECHO on [**2163-11-3**] (mild AS,
mild MR).  Upon arrival to the ED he was found to be hypotensive
with hyperkalemia and ARF (Cr ~4 from basline of 1.2)  He was
sent to the floor, diuresed and then sent to the ICU after he
was hypotensive requiring dopamine and vasopressin.  He had a
Swan-Ganz catheter placed on [**11-19**] and had renally dosed
dopamine.  He was thought to be fluid overloaded and had a
transudative thoracentesis (amount removed unknown).  He was
aggressively diuresed with Lasix and renally dosed Dopamine. His
renal function improved prior to transfer.
Swan numbers:
RA: 25
RV: 55/20/10
PA: 55/25
PCW: 26
His L flank pain was evaluated with a CT Abdomen and he was
found to have L nephrolithiasis and an exophytic cyst on the
lower pole of the L kidney.  His pain has been controlled with
narcotics.
He had also been recieving  Zyvox for presumed pneumonia and
solumedrol 60 mg q6h for presumed COPD.
He was transferred for evaluation of his mediatinal LAD.  This
has been watched for seveal years and he has two non-FDG avid
PET CTs, most recently in [**2163-6-26**].  He denies any B symptoms.
He does have decreased appetite, but has been active with
outside hobbies including golf and curling.  The thoracics
service was contact[**Name (NI) **] for this evaluation and it was suggested
that the patient be admitted to the MICU given his underlying
medical problems.

Pertinent Results:
[**2163-11-22**] Echo: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2 cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

[**2163-11-23**] Pathology report
1.  Lymph nodes, 4L, biopsy (A-C):
Metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasm, most consistent with
carcinoid tumor, in two of ten lymph nodes/lymph node fragments.
2.  Lymph nodes, 7, biopsy (D):
Metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasm, most consistent with
carcinoid tumor, in three of four lymph nodes/lymph node
fragments. See note.
3. Lymph nodes, level 7, biopsy (E):
Metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasm, most consistent with
carcinoid tumor, in one of two lymph nodes/lymph node fragments.
Note:
Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells are diffusely
positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin and are negative for
CK 7 and TTF-1.  Rare tumor cells are positive for CK20.
Despite the negative TTF-1, the tumor is compatible with a lung
primary.  Clinical correlation recommended.

FLOW CYTOMETRY [**11-23**]:
FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING:

The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, FMC-7,
Kappa, Lambda and CD antigens:  2,3,5,7,19,20,23, and 45.



RESULTS:

Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield.  B cells comprise 34% of
lymphoid-gated events, are polyclonal, and do not express
aberrant antigens.  T cells comprise 50% of lymphoid gated
events, and express mature lineage antigens.

INTERPRETATION:
Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic
immunophenotypic features of involvement by lymphoma are not
seen in specimen.  Correlation with clinical findings and
morphology (see S08-[**Numeric Identifier 66053**]) is recommended.  Flow cytometry
immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas due to
topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.

[**11-23**] Bronchial Washings:
 Bronchial washing, left upper lobe:

  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

  Reactive bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar
  macrophages.

ADDENDUM: Hematology slide 0559R of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
was
  reviewed and shows alveolar macrophages. No evidence of
  malignancy.

[**11-23**] CXR:
FINDINGS: No pneumothorax. There is complete opacification of
the left lung, which is indicating collapse in the left upper
lung, likely due to mucus plug. There is overlapping
opacification, which was seen on the previous film, in the left
lower lung which might be postoperative, inflammatory, or
malignant and further evaluation is needed.

There is a small right pleural effusion, unchanged. There is no
consolidation in the right lung. The right jugular line was
removed.

[**2163-11-23**] CXR Post-Bronch:

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the left lung
is slightly better aerated. There is no evidence of left-sided
pneumothorax. In the right lung, in the middle lobe, some subtle
areas of atelectasis are seen. No evidence of larger pleural
effusions.

[**2163-11-24**] CXR:
PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Compared to recent studies of
[**2163-11-23**], there is improved aeration of the left upper lung,
without evidence of new
pneum
