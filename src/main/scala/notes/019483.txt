Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness and cavity
size.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
ascending aorta. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (?#). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending
aorta. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened . There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: Patient is on no inotropic agents post-bypass. No
changes from pre-bypass findings. Left ventricular function is
normal. The aorta appears to be intact post decannulation. All
findings communicated to surgical team.

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] on
[**2176-9-17**] and underwent CABGx3(LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM1, OM3).  The
cross clamp time was 51 minutes with a total bypass time of 62
minutes.  He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the CVIVU in stable condition on Neo and Propofol.  He was
extubated on the post op night and had his chest tubes
discontinued on POD 1.  He was transferred to the floor on POD
1. His chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per protocol.
The post chest tube removal chest XRAY revealed at PTX and Mr.
[**Known lastname 33419**] was also symptomatic with low oxygen saturation. A chest
tube was re-inserted into the right pleural space and was placed
to suction with lung re-expansion. The chest tube was placed to
water seal on POD# 5 without PTX. Chest tube was removed and CXR
post removal resulted in a left sided small apical pneumothorax
which was stable on multiple subsequent chest radiographs.  The
patient was discharged to home after review of these radiographs
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] with the understanding that Mr. [**Known lastname 33419**]
should return  in three days to repeat a chest radiograph.  All
follow-up appointments were advised.
