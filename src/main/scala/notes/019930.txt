Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented had respiratory distress in the field. He
was intubated in the field and pan-CT showed no large abdominal
or chest catastrophe. He was found to be extrememly acidotic
despite ventilation (Ph 6.86). His blood pressure started
dropping just prior to transfer to the ICU. He received
vancomycin and levofloxacin. He received a fluid bolus. In the
ICU, a central line was urgently placed. An A-line could not be
obtained. his blood pressure continued to drop and he became
bradycardic. CXR revealed adequate line placement. He was coded
for 30 mintues and was pronounced dead within hours of arrival
to the ICU. Postmortem was refused by the family. Blood cultures
grew out anaerobic GNR which could not be further characterized.
It is possible that some sort of bowel rupture/abdominal process
caused his death, but hard to tell.
