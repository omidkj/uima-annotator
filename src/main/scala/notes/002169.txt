respiratory failure

tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 year-old man who is well known to the Transplant
service.   He underwent a liver transplant in [**5-/2158**] for EtOH
and HCV cirrhosis.  His post operative course was complicated by
a wound dehiscence and respiratory failure.

At rehabilitation he had his tracheostomy tube removed over the
subsequent 48 hours  developed respiratory failure.  He
presented to an outside hospital where an endotracheal tube was
place and was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for management.  Of note
he had a tracheal stenosis identified at bronchoscopy in [**Month (only) 216**]
of [**2158**] which was due to subglottic grannulation tissue.  The
stenosis was determined to have caused a 90% stenosis.  The
granulation tissue was resected by the interventional
pulmonoology service at the [**Hospital1 18**].

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] surgical ICU on [**2159-10-15**].
During his hospitalization a Thoracic Surgery consult was
obtained.  It was likely that the cause of his respiratory
failure was due to mechanical obstruction.  A sputum culture
from HD 2 showed Pseudomonas, which was considered to be a
contaminant.  On HD 3, a post-pyloric feeding tube was placed
for nutritional support.  His goal feeding rate was determined
to be 65 cc/hour of Respolar, which would give him 2371 kcals,
and 117g protein.  On HD 4, the patient underwent an open
tracheostomy by the Thoracic surgery service.  His tube feeds
were restarted on POD 1.  The patient was kept at [**Hospital1 18**] for
increased secretions requiring frequent suction.  On POD 4, the
patient was started on Ceftazidime for presumed pneumonia
diagnosed by chest X-ray and clinical presentation (low grade
temperature of 100.1 and no WBC count, but increased
secretions).  On POD 5, he was evaluated for a Passy-muir valve
but he did not tolerate the procedure well because of excessive
coughing and difficulty swallowing his secretions.  Please see
the recommendations of the speech and swallow team for more
detail.  The remainder of his post-operative course was
uneventful and he returned to rehabilitation in stable condition
on POD 5.
