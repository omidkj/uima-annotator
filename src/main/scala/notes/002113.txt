Admission Date:  [**2101-6-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-7-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2066-10-31**]       Sex:  F

Service:  NEUROLOGY
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Continued seizures.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 34 year-old
woman with a history of [**Doctor Last Name **] encephalitis at age 8
transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] with seizures.  She was
at her group home when she began having right sided facial
twitching, which progressed to right arm flexion with
unresponsiveness, which typically lasted one minute.  She was
given Valium, Dilantin 200 mg intravenous, Phenobarbital 60
mg and Kepra 500 mg with Ativan 2 mg intravenous and vago
nerve stimulator was used without resolution of seizures.
Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for an aspiration pneumonia three
days prior to presentation and she continued to have copious
output from her trach tube.

Her significant history includes left sided partial
hemispherectomy, which resulted in a right sided hemiplegia
and inability to speak, but comprehension appears intact.
She is MRSA positive and is status post tracheostomy and PEG
tube placement.  At baseline she uses a wheel chair to
ambulate and communicates with her mother with writing and
hand squeeze.

In the Emergency Room she was found to be febrile at 102.7
and after culture and lumbar puncture was done she was given
2 grams of Ceftriaxone, Ancef and Vancomycin.  She continued
to be seizure and therefore was given a total of 15 mg per
kilogram intravenous Dilantin, 60 mg of Phenobarbital and 4
mg of Ativan, 500 mg of Kepra.  This has decreased the
frequency of seizures, but not aborted them completely.  We
observed a seizure, which starts as a right facial
contraction with eyes rolled upward and to the right.  Her
right arm had a marked flexion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Seizures disorder.  2.
[**Doctor Last Name **] encephalitis.  3.  Left hemisphere
encephalomalacia.  4.  Right spastic hemiparesis.  5.  Mental
retardation.  6.  Thoracolumbar scoliosis.  7.  Vagal nerve
stimulator in 1/[**2099**].  8.  Status post left partial
hemispherectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

MEDICATIONS:  1.  Dilantin t.i.d. 200/100/200 mg.  2.
Phenobarbital t.i.d. 45/45/60.  3.  Kepra 500 mg po b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in a group home.  The rest
is not obtainable.  She has her mother visiting quite often.
Her mother's telephone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 40424**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  No seizures.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature max 102.4.
Temperature current 98.8.  Blood pressure 111/60.  Heart rate
90.  SPO2 98% on trach collar.  In general, the patient is a
young woman in no acute distress, but continuously seizing.
Head and neck, normocephalic, atraumatic, supple, trach in
place.  Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  Pulmonary
good air movement with some coarse sounds.  Abdomen positive
bowel sounds, soft.  Mental status, awake, nonverbal, but
between seizures she is able to follow commands, but cannot
attend for any length of time.  Uncooperative with the rest
of the mental status examination.  Cranial nerves pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light.  Fundi are normal.
Extraocular movements appears full.  Motor tone and bulk are
adequate, although some increased tone on the right hemibody.
Strength is full on the left.  Right side will not move to
command.  Right arm is flexed.  However, she provides some
resistance on the right iliopsoas.  Reflexes cannot elicit.
toes are up going bilaterally.  Sensation is not testable.

LABORATORY:  Sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 25, BUN 16, creatinine 0.4, glucose 96, phenytoin
10.3, phenobarbital 18.5, white count 7.45, hemoglobin 8.6,
hematocrit 26.9, platelets 584.  Differential PMNs of 77.7,
lymphocytes 17.6.  Urinalysis with a white count of 610.  CT
scan revealed no acute hemorrhage.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit where she was further loaded with Dilantin and
phenobarbital and her Keppra dosages were adjusted and her
status epilepticus was aborted.  She also had low blood
pressures in the setting of a fever, which was concerning for
septicemia.  Cultures were sent and the patient was started
on the usual Intensive Care Unit measures including central
venous access and arterial line for continues blood pressure
monitoring.

After several liters of normal saline bolus, Ms. [**Known lastname **]
improved clinically and her blood pressure responded
appropriately.  She was found to have a Pseudomonas
pneumonia, which was resistant to Ciprofloxacin.  At this
time all of her antibiotics were discontinued and she was
started on a fourteen day course of Ceftazidime.  She is at
the time of this dictation on day ten of a fourteen course of
Ceftaz.

With regard to her seizures as they were broken in the
Intensive Care Unit with adjustments of her antiepileptic
medications.  She was given intermittent phenytoin and
phenobarbital.  Phenobarbital levels were kept in the low to
mid 30s while phenytoin was kept in the low to mid 20s
without any clinical signs or symptoms of overdose.  Ms.
[**Known lastname **]' Kepra was also increased to 1000 b.i.d. at that time.
She remained seizure free for the remainder of her Intensive
Care Unit stay and was transferred out to the medical floor.
Three or four days subsequently she developed facial
twitches, which is consistent with epilepsia partialis
continua and therefore her medications were adjusted
accordingly.  Currently she is continued on phenobarbital 60
mg per nasogastric t.i.d. with phenytoin suspension 350 mg
per nasogastric q 12 hours along with Kepra 1500 mg po b.i.d.
per nasogastric.  Although she continues to have some facial
twitching these do not bother her and they are of decreased
frequency.  Although it is possible to increase her
antiepileptic medications we anticipate that given the high
drug levels, we would be approaching the toxic levels
shortly.

Clinically [**Known firstname **] is stable.  She has remained seizure free
since two days after admission.  She has done well from a
neurological perspective.  With regard to her pneumonia and
need for frequent suctioning, this has significantly improved
during the course of this hospitalization.  She now only
requires intermittent suctioning and has two more days of
Ceftazidime.

We note that Ms. [**Known lastname **] has a very small tracheostomy tube and
we have been informed by her interventional pulmonologist
that this tube should not be decannulated outside of a
medical Intensive Care Unit.  Tracheostomy care, however, is
per usual.  The only caveat is any tracheostomy decannulation
or change needs to be done in a monitored Intensive Care
Unit.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Markedly improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to a rehabilitation facility
when a bed is available.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  [**Doctor Last Name **] encephalitis.
2.  Seizure disorder.
3.  Right spastic hemiparesis.
4.  Recurrent aspirations pneumonia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Phenobarbital 60 mg nasogastric
t.i.d.  2.  Dilantin suspension 350 mg per nasogastric b.i.d.
3.  Kepra 1500 mg per nasogastric b.i.d.  4.  Zoloft 50 mg
per nasogastric tube q day.  5.  Folate 1 mg per nasogastric
q day.  6.  Zantac 150 mg per nasogastric b.i.d.  7.  Colace
100 mg po b.i.d.  8.  Dulcolax 10 mg po pr b.i.d. prn
constipation.  9.  Ceftazidime 1 gram intravenous q 8 hours
