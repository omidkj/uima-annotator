History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 45917**] is a 75 year old woman with hypertension, CHF with
diastolic dysfunction, PAF, type II diabetes, prior MI, lung
cancer and s/p partial lung resection who was hospitalized at
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**2188-12-13**] to [**2188-12-23**] for SOB and cough. She was
treated for a CHF exacerbation as well as pneumonia. At the time
of admission, she had hypertensive urgency with systolic blood
pressures in the 200 range. She developed flash pulmonary edema
requiring intubation x 3 days. Post intubation, she subsequently
developed several episodes of hyptertension, requiring a nitro
gtt. A renal ultrasound was negative for renal artery stenosis.
Urinary metanephrines were also sent to rule out pheochomocytoma
and were negative. Transient ischemic changes were noted on EKG
during her hypertensive episodes. Troponin levels were elevated
to a peak of 0.77 but CPK??????s were negative. An [**Month/Day/Year 113**] done on
[**2188-12-13**] revealed hyperdynamic systolic function. There was
severe mitral annular calcification and moderate thickening of
the mitral valve chordae with at least mild to moderate [**1-21**]+
mitral regurgitation. Small pericardial effusion.
.
A pMIBI done in [**12/2187**] was negative for perfusion defects and
showed an EF of 54%
.
Following discharge, the patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2189-1-19**]. At that time, she was complaining of swelling in both
hands and legs as well as in her face. She was also complaining
of 3 pillow orthopnea at that time. She denises any PND. She
denies any lightheadedness. She denies any claudication
symptoms. She continues to have swelling her legs but reports
that the swelling in her hands and face has improved. She
reports having one episode of chest pain the other night after
dinner. She said it occurred intermittently at rest over a few
hours and then finally resolved spontaneously. She denies having
any associated symptoms and states that this is the only episode
of chest pain she has had since her hospitalization.
