Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
88yo F resident of [**Hospital3 2558**] with CAD s/p CABG (last known
EF 40%), CHF, DM who presents with progressive sob for one week.
As per the daughter, the pt has been having progressive LE edema
and orthopnea as well. The pt was treated for presumed pneumonia
for the last 1 week at [**Hospital3 2558**]. Per records and daughter,
pt never had fever but had light colored sputum production. She
was treated with levofloxacin but did not improve. After few
days without improvement in dyspnea, pt was given lasix
diuresis. Ultimately renal function declined and she was given
IVF. On the day of admission, she became increasingly dyspneic
and lethargic and was subsequently transfered to the ED.


EMS found the pt pale diaphoretic and tachypneic to 30s with
SaO2 of 80% on 2L -> 100% on NRB. The pt was also found to have
BP of 170/65, with HR of 80 on arrival to the ED. On exam, she
was found to have elevated JVP, with [**Month (only) **] BS at bases and
crackles up halfway, he was also having abdominal breathing and
was minimally responsive (although primarily Russian speaking).
ABG at the time was 7.34/67/229. A foley catheter was placed and
the pt was given lasix 40mg IV x1. A nitro gtt was started and
the pt was placed on BiPAP. Due to difficult access, a right fem
line was placed. Placed on BiPAP without improvement in CO2 or
mental status. The pt eventually put out several hundred ml of
urine and her respiratory status improved. Her nitro gtt was
discontinued and she was eventually converted to NC. ABG
improved to 7.41/61/89. BNP returned at [**Numeric Identifier 104170**]. She was also
given ceftriaxone 1g IV x1 and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].


Past Medical History:

inferolateral hypokinesis.
2. Hypertension
3. Hypercholesterolemia
4. Diabetes Mellitus
5. Colorectal Cancer, s/p resetion in [**2177**] with positive nodes.
Chose to be followed conservatively without chemotherapy.
6. s/p left hemispheric CVA. Pt had left internal capsule and
left occipital infarcts.
7. Gait instability. Patient has had frequent falls due to
instability secondary to knee and hip pain, DJD of spine and old
CVA's (above)
8. s/p L ORIF ([**6-14**])
9. GERD
10. Vitamin B12 deficiency. Patient receives monthly injections.

muscle use.
HEENT: EOMI, anicteric, mmm, op clear
Neck: thick big neck, difficult to appreciate JVP

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
ECG [**2183-2-5**]: NSR at 80, nml-left [**Hospital1 **] axis, wide QRS, Q in III,
TWI in I and L, V4-v6.


CXR [**2183-2-5**]: bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary vascular
congestion consistent with CHF. Evaluation of the underlying
lung parenchyma is difficult with likely superimposed bibasilar
compressive atelectasis or consolidation. The lung apices are
better visualized on the current study and appear clear. The
osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
.
TTE [**2-6**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is asymmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Impression: moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation; asymmetric
septal
hypertrophy

Brief Hospital Course:
88yo F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF with EF of 40% and DM presents
with one week of progressive SOB.
.
Heart Failure: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for progressive
shortness of breath and was thoroughly evaluated from a
cardiopulmonary and hematologic standpoint.  Her hematocrit was
near baseline.  A myocardial infarction was excluded with an ECG
and three sets of cardiac enzymes.  Her CXR had the distinctive
appearance of CHF without evidence of pneumonia; a BNP level
supported this diagnosis, as did both her history and physical.
She was initially and briefly admitted to the MICU and treated
with BiPAP; she responded well there to diurese and was soon
transferred to the medical floor where diuresis continued
without difficulty.  Given renal insufficiency, her captopril
was held and she was started on hydralazine and isosorbide
mononitrate, as an ace-inhibitor equivalent.  She was negative
by ins/outs and her oxygen requirement improved to mid-90's on
room air by the time of discharge.  Her Echo showed and ef of
70% but mod-severe MR.  She was put on a brief prednisone taper
for a concern of exacerbation of an underlying reactive airways
disease.
.
DM: For her DM, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was continued on NPH and regular
insulin.  Her Avandia was stopped given its propensity to
increase fluid rentenion.  Her blood sugars were well controlled
on the insulin-only regimen.
.
UTI: The pt had UA suggestive of infection at time of admission.
As the pt was recently
