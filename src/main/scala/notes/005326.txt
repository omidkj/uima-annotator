Service:  Cardiology Medicine CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year-old man
without significant past medical history who was brought to
the Emergency Room from the [**Company 3596**] with acute respiratory
distress.  Per EMS, the patient denied any chest pain, he did
have rales and wheezing and a positive jugular venous
distention.  He was in sinus bradycardia when EMS was called.
In the Emergency Room, the patient's heart rate was 120 with
a blood pressure of 180/90, which subsequently rose to
230/120.  He was given nitroglycerin, albuterol nebulizers,
80 mg of intravenous Lasix and intubated for respiratory
distress.  Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with ST
elevation in V1 through V3 of 1 to [**Street Address(2) 32524**] depressions in
2 with T-wave inversions in V4 and 5.  The patient also had Q
waves in V1 through V3.  He was taken to the catheter lab
where he was found to have an ejection fraction of 35%,
anterobasal hypokinesis and anterolateral and apical akinesis
with elevated left and right heart pressures.  His coronary
anatomy revealed a proximal 40% RCA lesion that was
ulcerated, proximal 100% lesion of the LAD and proximal left
circumflex lesion that was 20% and it was thought that the
RCA was providing collateral circulation to the left side of
the heart and had been transiently blocked.  Therefore, the
RCA was stented with 0% residual.  The LAD was resistant to
multiple attempts at opening and was thought to be a chronic
lesion.  The patient was then transferred to the CCU
intubated.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Known coronary artery disease.
2.  Known diabetes.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  None

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a resident of the [**Location (un) 86**]
[**Company 3596**].  He works at [**Company 32525**].  He reports one to two drinks
a day of alcohol.  He has about a 40 pack year tobacco
history and currently smokes.  He denies cocaine or
intravenous drug use.  His family contacts are his brother,
[**Name (NI) 518**] [**Name (NI) 32526**], phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 32527**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unable to obtain.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.0??????, heart rate 76, respiratory
rate 16, blood pressure 101/65, intubated on 100% oxygen
saturating 100%.
GENERAL:  This is an elderly male intubated in no acute
distress who answers questions by nodding appropriately.  His
head, ears, eyes, nose and throat showed extraocular
movements intact.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
The jugular venous distention could not be assessed.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2, soft
systolic murmur was heard at the apex.
LUNGS:  Rancorous throughout to anterolateral exam.  There
were no wheezes.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with normal bowel
sounds.  The patient had hepatomegaly to about 6 cm below the
costophrenic angle.
EXTREMITIES:  The patient had right groin sheath and all
distal pulses were dopplerable.
GENITOURINARY:  The patient had left scrotal swelling about
10 cm in diameter.  It was nontender without erythema and
there were no bowel sounds.
NEUROLOGIC:  The patient was awake, alert, moved all limbs,
answered questions, appropriate.

LABORATORY EXAM:  White blood cell count 16.3, hematocrit
35.4, platelets 353.  Chem-7:  Sodium 134, potassium 4.9,
chloride 96, bicarbonate 23, BUN 18, creatinine 1.2, blood
sugar 268.  PT and PTT were all within normal limits.  The
patient had liver function testing.  His ALT was 95, AST 156,
alkaline phosphatase 222.  Total bilirubin was 0.4, albumin
3.8.  Initial CK was 207.  CK later peaked at 604 with a
troponin greater than 50.

IMAGING:  Chest x-ray, AP, showed patchy diffuse infiltrates
bilaterally consistent with pulmonary edema versus aspiration
versus pneumonia.  There is mild hyperinflation with small
bilateral pleural effusion.  ECC placement was acceptable.
Electrocardiogram on admission was sinus rhythm at 80 with a
normal axis and ST elevation of 1 to 5 mm in V1 through [**Street Address(2) 32528**] depressions in 2 with T-wave inversions in V4, 5 and L.
Post catheter, the patient's sinus rhythm was 75 with 1 to [**Street Address(2) 32529**] elevations in V1 through V3.   T-wave
inversions were resolving and lead 2 no longer had ST
depressions.

Right heart catheterization results showed a right atrial
pressure of 17, right ventricular pressure of 48/12 to 20, P
pressure of 44/24 with a mean of 32 and wedge was difficult
to assess, but was estimated to be 26 to 30.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 68-year-old gentleman without
known coronary artery disease who presents with acute
respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary edema and
electrocardiogram changes suggestive of acute anterior
myocardial infarction.  In the catheterization lab, he had
elevated filling pressures and a likely chronically occluded
LAD knot minimal to intervention and an ulcerated 40% RCA
lesion which was stented.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:
    Pump function:  The patient had an ejection fraction in
the catheterization lab of 35% with increased filling
pressures and pulmonary edema.  Follow up echocardiogram
which was suboptimal in nature showed an enlarged LA,
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with severe global
hypo to akinesis and an ejection fraction of 20%.  Given that
the patient presented in florid congestive heart failure, he
was aggressively diuresed with Lasix.  He was maintained on
intravenous T&G for preload reduction and started on
captopril for afterload reduction.  The nitrates were
gradually converted to po and captopril was increased.  The
patient's heart failure improved after a total of
approximately 5 liters diuresis.  His optimal estimated dry
weight is 181 pounds.  He was started on a standing dose of
po Lasix 40 mg q day and ACE inhibitors were eventually
changed to lisinopril 15 mg q day.  Further, he was started
on Imdur 30 mg q day.

    Rate and rhythm:  The patient presented in sinus with
occasional PVCs.  He had no malignant arrhythmias while on
Telemetry.  He was started on low level beta blockers which
were gently titrated to atenolol 25 mg q day.

2.  ISCHEMIA:  The patient is status post stent of the RCA
for the LAD remains totally occluded.  It was felt that since
this chronic LAD lesion is not amenable to intervention and
that the RCA is providing right to left shunt, but any
further occlusion of the RCA would represent left main
equivalent.  Therefore, it was recommended that the patient
be medically optimized for the time being and followed with
repeat angiogram in approximately three months for any
evidence of stent re-occlusion.  For the time being, he is
maintained on aspirin, Plavix x1 month.  He received
Integrilin for 48 hours ad was kept on heparin until his
Coumadin was therapeutic.  Cholesterol was checked and he was
found to have a total cholesterol of 173, triglycerides 71,
HDL 47 and LDL 112.  Therefore, he was started on Lipitor.
CKs were cycled with a peak of 604 and troponin of greater
than 50, but these gradually declined.  The patient will need
follow up for his anticoagulation which he was started on for
anterior wall akinesis and high likelihood of LV thrombus
formation.

4.  PULMONARY:  The patient presented in acute pulmonary
edema with bilateral infiltrates which required intubation.
He was weaned off the vent on day #2 of Intensive Care Unit,
but required reintubation for respiratory distress in the
setting of tachycardia, hypertension and the patient's
attempt to get out of bed.  He was further diuresed and was
successfully extubated on day #4 of his MICU stay.  Given his
smoking history, he may have an element of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and will need pulmonary
function testing as an outpatient.

5.  RENAL:  The patient had a creatinine of 1.2 which bumped
slightly to 1.6 in the setting of aggressive diuresis and at
the time of this dictation, the patient's creatinine was back
down to his baseline of 1.3.

6.  HEM/ONC:  The patient's hematocrit remained relatively
stable during his
