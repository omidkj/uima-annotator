Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension s/p CCY


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
65M h/o DM2, diastolic CHF, COPD on home O2, admitted to OSH
with atypical chest pain on [**2106-3-21**]. Was at home in bed
developed left-sided chest pain without radiation x a few
minutes, which repeated a few times. No nausea, vomiting, SOB.
Has a baseline cough that was unchanged. No fever, abdominal
pain, dysuria, headache.
.
At the OSH, he ruled out for MI with negative enzymes and
underwent dobutamine nuclear stress with small partially
reversible inferior defect. He did have a recent presentation to
ED with abdominal pain and found to have gallstones, planned for
elective CCY [**9-1**], so decided to proceed with elective
procedure and underwent lap chole yesterday. Intraoperatively
develeped hypotension associated with reported dynamic
inferolateral STD on ECG. Given 2L NS and started on peripheral
neo gtt. Extubated at end of surgery but required reintubation
shortly. CE's flat. Hct stable. CXR with bibasilar infiltrates
and pleural effusions, concern for pneumonia and sepsis, started
on levofloxacin and flagyl. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management and consideration of cath given ECG changes.
.
Unable to perform review of symptoms other than noted above, as
patient is intubated and sedated.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
.
EKG demonstrated NSR, 70bpm, normal axis and intervals, no ST-T
changes with no significant change compared with prior dated
[**2104-1-14**].
.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2104-1-14**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is probably normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are probably normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Dobutamine SPECT performed on [**2106-3-22**] demonstrated:
Small reversible inferior wall defect. EF 56%.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Hypotension - Patient was initially transfered on a neo drip
and nitro paste.  Both medications were quickly discontinued and
his [**Known lastname **] pressure stablized.  Cardiac enzymes were flat and
EKGs done here were not suggestive of cardiac ischemia.  He was
restarted on his [**Known lastname **] pressures meds.  The exact cause of his
hypotension is not know.  There was a concern with the history
of positive stress and some dynamic EKG changes seen at the OSH
that it might be cardiac.  These tracings were not available to
use but the evidence does not suggest a cardiac cause.  It is
also possible that he was transiently bacteremic during the
surgical procedure leading to the brief hypotension.  [**Known lastname **]
cultures drawn here did not grow any organisms and he did
complete a course of levo/flagyl. He was discharged on bactrim
for possible local wound infection (see below).
.
Respiratory Failure - It seems that the patient failed initial
extubation at the OSH.  He was transfered on a ventilator.
Chest xrays were suggestive of a possible pneumonia and he was
treated with a 7 day course of levo/flagyl.  He was intially
difficult to wean and extubate.  From his records, he has
underlying pulmonary disease.  He also appeared to be volume
overloaded.  He was diuresed and extubated.  After extubation,
he was noted to have oxygen saturations in the mid to upper 80s
consistently, at times dipping to the low 80s.  Per the
patient's report, this is typical for him, and he is on home
oxygen therapy.  There does not seem to be formal documentation
of PFTs.  We suggest that PFTs be obtained by his PCP after
discharge.
.
CAD - The patient had a positive SPECT stress at the OSH showing
a small reversible inferior wall defect.  Theses images were not
available to us.  He was initially transfered for a
consideration of cardiac catheterization.  His cardiac enzymes
were flat and EKGs not suggestive of ischemia here.  Cardiac
Cath was defered after discussion with the patient and
considering his renal function at this time.  He was told to
follow up with a cardiologist after discharge for possible
further evaluation in the future.  He was maintained on ASA, BB,
Statin, and ACEI.  He was on plavix during the hospitalization,
but was not continued on this as an out patient.  ACE-I was
discontinued due to acute renal failure while in the hospital.
This should be restarted as an outpatient when Cr improves, if
BP tolerates.
.
Post Lap Chole - Patient had surgery performed on [**2106-3-23**].
