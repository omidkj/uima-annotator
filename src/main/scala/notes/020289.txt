Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 97.6 BP: 97/64 P: 58 R: 13 18 O2: 100% on FIO2 100%
CMV
General: intubated, sedated
HEENT: dry MM, clear OP
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
rhonchi
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: foley in place
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema


Pertinent Results:
[**8-20**] Head CT: There is no evidence for acute hemorrhage, edema,
mass effect, or recent infarction. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. There is prominence of the
ventricles and sulci, unchanged from prior examinationand
consistent with diffuse parenchymal atrophy. This is slightly
more prominent than would be expected for the patient's age,
however, is unchanged from [**2198**]. The visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are unremarkable. No osseous
abnormality is identified.

[**8-23**] CXR:
1. Mild fluid overload.
2. Bibasilar opacities may be due to a atelectasis, but
infectious
consolidation is not excluded.

[**9-8**] ERCP:
ERCP: Images demonstrate cannulation of the pancreatic duct with
no obvious filling abnormalities or contrast extravasation. An
abrupt cutoff is present, reflecting prior distal
pancreatectomy. A plastic pancreatic duct stent was placed.
Subsequent injection of the common bile duct demonstrates distal
filling
defects consistent with stones. Contrast is seen entering the
jejunum,
consistent with prior choledochojejunostomy.
.
[**9-12**] CT abdomen: 1. Interval placement of a left flank pigtail
catheter with apparent drainage of abscess/fluid, but persisting
phlegmon, albeit decreased in size.
2. Apparent resolution of right lower lobe pneumonia. Resolution
of right
pleural effusion and persisting small left pleural effusion.
3. Unchanged appearance of extensive portal/mesenteric/splenic
venous clot.
4. Persistent omental varices.
5. Stable renal cysts.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo m with hx of liver transplant with recurrent cirrhosis,
admitted with AMS, fever, and apnea.
.
AMS/Encephalopathy: Presentation to ICU with altered mental
status was initially secondary to hepatic encephalopathy and
delerium from multiple infections: pneumonia and abdominal
abcess.  Initial work up involved: a lumbar puncture with normal
CSF, CT of the head sig for no acute process, and negative blood
and urine cultures.  An ultrasound of the abdomen showed chronic
portal vein thrombosis.  Patient was continued on lactulose and
started on rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.  Mental status
decompensated [**8-27**] during hospitalization secondary to
iatrogenic narcotic overdose (see below for full details) in the
ICU, but improved with narcan x1 and holding of all sedating
medications (oxycodone, methadone, and trazadone).  Mental
status improved to baseline with treatment of multiple infection
and rifaimin and lactulose.
.
Apnea: Patient was found to be apneic and intubated in the ED.
Respiratory depression was felt to be related to hepatic
encephalopathy and delirium secondary to PNA and abdominal
abscess infections.  Patient was extubated on [**8-26**] without any
complications.   On [**8-27**] patient was agitated, placed on wrist
restraints, and given haldol, trazadone and oxyc
