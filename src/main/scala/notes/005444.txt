Service:  Hepatobiliary Surgery Service


ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Hepatocellular carcinoma.
2.  Renal cell carcinoma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
male who was first diagnosed with male diagnosed breast
cancer in [**2190-5-19**]. During his course of the evaluation, he
underwent a chest and abdominal CT that was performed on [**2190-7-2**], which demonstrated a left breast mass measuring 2.1
x 1.7 cm. Also work-up included a CT of the abdomen
demonstrating a metastatic tumor. The CT of the abdomen
demonstrated a 2.8 x 3.7 cm lesion in the segment VI of the
liver, and a 3.9 x 4.1 cm mass in the midpole of the right
kidney.

On [**2190-7-13**], a PET scan was performed demonstrating a
left breast FDG avid mass, and an anterior midpole right
renal mass that is FDG avid, and a large non-FDG avid
mediastinal lymph node.

Biopsy was performed of the right renal mass on [**2190-8-10**], demonstrating no evidence of malignancy, but a fine-
needle aspirate was positive for renal cell carcinoma.

On [**2190-9-3**], a core liver biopsy of the liver mass
was performed demonstrating moderately to poorly
differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Follow-up MRI was
performed on [**2190-9-1**], demonstrating a 3.3 x 2.5 cm
lesion, segment V and VI, of the liver, and 3.5 x 4.0 cm
lesion in the right kidney. Part of the work-up included head
CT on [**2190-9-1**], which was negative for metastatic
disease.

The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a possible hepatic
resection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hemachromatosis in
[**2181**]. Intermittently has phlebotomy. Type 2 diabetes
diagnosed in [**2181**]. History of TIA in [**2179**] and takes aspirin
daily. History of a ruptured diverticular disease. History of
mild COPD. Hypertension. Status post motor vehicle accident
in [**2144**].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  In [**2182**] the patient underwent
nasal/sinus surgery. In the [**2164**], the patient is status post
colon resection for ruptured diverticulitis. On [**2190-8-24**], the patient had a mediastinoscopy and a bronchoscopy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glucophage, Zestril 20 mg daily,

LABORATORY DATA:  Prior to admission, WBC 11.3, hematocrit
49.0, platelets 366; INR 1.2; sodium 142, 4.7, 105, 23, BUN
and creatinine 23 and 1.4; AST 22, ALT 14, alkaline
phosphatase 82, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 4.1.

In [**2190-6-18**], his AST was 4.2, and CEA was 5.5.

The patient was admitted on [**2190-9-24**], for a right
hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy, radical right
nephrectomy, with intraoperative ultrasound, and two
incisional hernia repairs, and lysis of adhesions performed
by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 3826**]. Please see detailed information
regarding surgery in the operative note.

Postoperatively the patient went to the SICU. The patient had
a right IJ placed. CVPs ranged from [**7-28**]. The patient was on
an epidural infusion of Demerol. The patient was extubated on
a shovel mask. NG tube was in place. The patient was placed
on Unasyn 3 g every q.6 hours.

Postoperatively the patient had a WBC of 15.8, hematocrit
40.1, platelets 191, PT 16.4, PTT 35.2, INR 1.9. The patient
had a sodium of 146, 4.6, 117, 20, BUN 29 and 2.1. ALT 96,
AST 135, alkaline phosphatase 67, 0.9.

The patient had a postoperative chest x-ray demonstrating
mild congestive heart failure which has improved, small
bilateral pleural effusion, no evidence of pneumothorax
identified.

The patient was given FFP for an INR of 1.9.

The patient continued with the epidural for pain control. NG
was removed. The patient continued with FFP to correct his
INR. Diet was slowly advanced. The patient was getting serial
coags to keep INR less than 2.5.

Repeat chest x-ray [**9-26**] revealed worsening bilateral
pleural effusion and bilateral bibasilar atelectasis. The
patient received 40 of Lasix, and IV maintenance was
decreased. The Swan-Ganz catheter was removed. Unasyn was
discontinued.

On [**2190-9-28**], hospital day 5, postoperative day 4, the
patient was tolerating clears and was transferred from the
ICU. The patient continued with the JP draining clear
serosanguineous fluid. Physical therapy was consulted. The
central line was removed, and a peripheral line was placed.

The epidural catheter was removed. The patient was placed on
p.o. pain medications which he tolerated well. Because the
patient was gaining weight and his lower extremities had
edema, the patient was started on Lasix 20 mg IV t.i.d. which
he responded well. The patient's blood sugars were
intermittently elevated. He was on an insulin sliding scale,
and [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted to recommend the best insulin
medication since preoperatively he was on Avandia and
Glyburide which are both cytotoxic. The patient was
ambulating with a walker without shortness of breath or
distress.

The results of the pathology came back from his surgery
demonstrated:

1.  Gallbladder demonstrated cholelithiasis, cholesterol
    type.
2.  Portal lymph node; 1 lymph node with sinus histiocytosis
    and lipophagic granulomas. No malignancy identified.
3.  Liver, right lobe, resection (S-N) hepatocellular
    carcinoma and also non-carcinomatous liver tissue with a
    1) trichome stain: Mild periportal fibrosis, 2) iron
    stain: No stainable iron, 3) reticulin stain:
    Condensation of reticulin fibers in periportal areas.
4.  Right kidney resection demonstrated renal cell carcinoma.

The patient had a few drains. One of the drains was removed
on [**2190-10-2**]. LFTs were obtained demonstrating an ALT
of 30, AST 33, alkaline phosphatase 167, total bilirubin 3.7,
which both alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin had
increased from the day before. A liver duplex was obtained on
[**2190-10-2**], demonstrating status post right hepatic
lobectomy with patent vasculature and no large fluid
collections identified.

Also a CT of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained on [**2190-10-2**], demonstrated 1) no intrahepatic bile duct
dilatation or perihepatic fluid collections, 2) no
intraperitoneal or intrapelvic abscess, and 3) basilar lung
changes with small effusions, emphysematous changes and areas
of consolidations. An infectious process cannot be excluded
in the lung bases based on these images.

Because the patient's WBC had elevated, blood cultures,
peritoneal fluid, urine cultures and sputum culture was
obtained. From [**10-2**], two sets of blood cultures were
obtained which are still pending. The peritoneal fluid that
was obtained demonstrated no growth. Anaerobic culture
demonstrated no growth. Gram-stain showed no microorganisms.

Urine culture was obtained on [*
