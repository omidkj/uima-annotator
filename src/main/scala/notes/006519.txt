Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
64 y/o gentleman with asthma has complained of SOB since Sunday.
 He has had productive cough.  PCP prescribed azithromycin which
the patient has taken in the last two days.  Today his SOB
acutely worsened. He took inhalers/nebs today without any

available.  In [**Hospital1 18**] ED her vitals were T 99.8  BP 124/96  HR 94
 RR 19  92% oxygen saturated with unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] settings.
Difficulty ventilating him adequately in ED.  Patient received
propofol gtt, vecuronium, ASA 325 x1, ceftriaxone 2 gram IV x 1,
and azithromycin 500 mg x 1.
.
On arrival to the MICU patient was intubated, sedated and on
paralytics.  Most of the history was obtained from his wife and
from the chart.  No fever, chills, nightsweats, chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, dysuria, bleeding.
No known sick contacts.


Past Medical History:
- Asthma, never intubated in the past, last hospitalization 4
years ago, has been on prednisone for most of the last one year,
ranging from 10 mg to 40 mg daily
- Hypertension
- Hypercholesterolemia
- h/o WCT in [**2121**], clean coronaries, EP study  where  AVNRT  was
induced with both left bundle branch block   pattern   and
right  bundle  branch  block  pattern. Abnormality was
successfully ablated

sounds,
Extremities: LUE extremity noted to have 2+ edema, [**12-7**]+ edema
noted in b/l LE
Skin: Bruises noted over upper extremities.
Neurologic: Alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate history without
difficulty. 3+ grip strength b/l

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:

[**2-5**] CTA CHEST: There are no pulmonary artery filling defects to
suggest pulmonary embolism. Additionally, there are no secondary
signs of embolism, including no evidence of right-sided heart
strain. Minimal atherosclerotic calcifications involve the
thoracic aorta, which is tortuous; however, there is no acute
aortic pathology identified including no aortic dissection.
Atherosclerotic calcifications also involve the coronary
arteries. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion. Scattered
prominent hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes measure up to
approximately 9 mm in short axis. In the lungs, diffuse
bilateral tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities are associated with a few more
focal small ground glass opacities. A small amount of
atelectasis is noted at the right lung base. An endotracheal
tube appears appropriately positioned with secretions noted in
the distal trachea and bronchi. Although this exam is not
tailored to evaluate abdominal organs, limited evaluation of the
upper abdomen is performed. A nasogastric tube terminates in the
proximal stomach. A 6.2 cm exophytic cyst projects anterior from
the interpolar region of the right kidney, partially imaged.
Fullness of the left renal collecting system is only partially
imaged.
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2. Diffuse bilateral tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities consistent with a
small airways
infection or inflammation. Aspiration should also be considered
in the setting of airway secretions.
3. Fullness of the left renal collecting system is only
partially imaged.
Dedicated ultrasound to look for frank hydronephrosis can be
performed as
clinically indicated.

LUE Venous Ultasound:([**2132-2-20**])
INDICATIONS: 64-year-old woman with asthma and asymmetric left
upper
extremity edema with PICC line. Question DVT.
IMPRESSION: No deep vein thrombosis.

Chest X-ray ([**2132-2-19**]):
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of Dobbhoff tube placement.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2132-2-17**].

The Dobbhoff tube tip is in proximal stomach. The left PICC line
tip is at
the cavoatrial junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis seen on the left,
and the rest of the lungs are unremarkable. Minimal pleural
effusion cannot be excluded, especially on the left.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist
