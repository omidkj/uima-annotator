Allergies:
Klonopin / Morphine

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Multiple bronchoscopies w/ stenting and later stent removal

History of Present Illness:
75 year-old woman with hx of tracheobronchomalacia and COPD
complicated by vocal chord dysfunction, prolonged history of
COPD exacerbations, on 3L home O2 at night, s/p Y-stent
placement a couple of weeks ago by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who presented to
OSH with increased SOB over past 3 days and hypoxia.  She was
noted to have room air O2 saturation of 85% at [**Hospital1 1562**],
improved to 96% on room air after nebulizers.  Patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management by IP. Patient
reports taking her mucolytics regularly though daughter is
concerned about compliance.  Of note, she was recently
hospitalized for COPD exacerbation, initially started on
broad-spectrum antibiotics, which were narrowed down to
levofloxacin to complete course, discharged on prednisone taper.
.
In the ED, patient was initially 88% on RA.  She received
Duonebs and was started on Bipap, after which she improved to
100% O2sat.  She was given IV lorazepam as well to help with
anxiety on Bipap.  EKG showed NSR 79 with no changes from prior,
and CXR showed persistent left retrocardiac opacity from prior.
Vitals prior to transfer were as follows:  afebrile, 98.4, HR 84
139/72 28 100% BiPap 8/5 and 100%FiO2. On arrival to the ICU,
patient still in some respiratory distress, on Bipap.

.
CXR: [**1-8**] Improved bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of
increased lung
volumes as compared to the [**2183-12-25**] study. Persistent
left
retrocardiac opacity remains, reflecting chronic changes.
.
[**2183-12-30**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure

could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal study, pulmonary pressures not obtainable

because of technically-inadequate tricuspid regurgitation jet.
Grossly preserved biventricular systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
75M with hx of tracheobronchomalacia and COPD complicated by
vocal chord dysfunction on home O2 who presented to OSH with
increased SOB over past 3 days and hypoxia and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for interventional pulmonology. Brief Hospital Course is
as follows:

# Shortness of breath:
Patient has history of COPD on home O2, recently discharged from
hospitalization for COPD exacerbation.  A large mucus plug was
suctioned from Y-stent during bronchoscopy on arrival to MICU
with subsequent improvement in symptoms back to baseline. She
received the following meds mucinex 1200mg po BID, inhaled
acetylcysteine [**Hospital1 **], prn nebs and her prednisone taper from
previous hospitalization was continued. The patient again had a
bronchoscopy on ICU day #2, which showed thin mucous and stent
in place. They recommended BiPap to be used as needed for SOB.
On HD #4, the patient underwent a 3rd bronch as her symptoms had
not been improving with the recent stents. The Y-stent was
removed on [**1-12**] out of concern for mucus plugging. She was
briefly on BiPap for respiratory distress but tolerated the mask
for 1.5 hours. The patient's dyspnea had a significant anxiety
component and she responded well to Ativan. Palliative care was
consulted and the patient expressed her wishes to be DNR/DNI -
the patient's daughters were also involved in this discussion.
Palliative care also recommended improved pain control with
oxycodone and prn dilaudid. Interventional pulmonology
recommended prn BiPap and prn mucolytics for her symptoms. She
was treated with a course of antibiotics for fever with presumed
pulmonary source. Her prednisone was tapered. She is being
discharged to rehab with one day left of IV antibiotic therapy
and 3 days of her steroid taper. She is being set up for an
outpatient sleep study to get home CPAP setup.
.
# Hx of Seizure Disorder: Home lamotrigine was continued
.
# Hypothyroidism: Home levothyroxine was continued
.
# Depression: Her home venlafaxine was restarted
.
# DVT prophylaxis was with subcutaneous heparin.
.
# Communication was with daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 18233**] (HCP). Code
status was DNR/DNI (confirmed with daughter, HCP). She will
accept rehospitalization if necessary, however she refuses to
come back to [**Location (un) 86**] for any reason. She will only accept going
to community hospitals near her rehab and her home. She will
benefit from pallative care planning from rehab.
