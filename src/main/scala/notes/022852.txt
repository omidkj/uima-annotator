History of Present Illness:
65yo female with multiple medical problems including Type 2
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and PE was admitted from the ED
with fever and multiple other complaints.

She reports that she felt well until the afternoon of admission.
 She went to orthopedics clinic where she had a steroid
injection into the shoulder. Later that afternoon, she suddenly
developed weakness, fevers, and shaking chills. Associated
symptoms include persistent nonproductive cough, shortness of
breath nausea, vomiting, and loose stools x 2. Regarding her
cough, she has had cough for the last 4-6 weeks, which she
attributes to changing of the seasons. Her nausea and vomiting
began on the afternoon of admission and she vomited a very small
amount of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. She had two episodes of
loose stools which she describes as nonbloody and primarily
water. Additional symptoms include crampy abdominal pain. When
EMS came to take her into the hospital, she felt right sided
flank pain when the ambulance drivers tried to raise the right
sided railing of the stretcher.

Upon arrival in the ED, temp 101.1, HR 115, BP 121/108, RR 18,
and pulse ox 98% on 4L NC. Exam was notable for morbid obesity,
epigastric tenderness, right flank tenderness, and erythematous
pannus surrounding right flank. Labs are notable for WBC 15.4
with 8 percent bands. CXR was unremarkable. CT Abd/Pelvis was of
poor quality due to body habitus. She received 2L IVF, benadryl,
and vancomycin / clindamycin for coverage of colitis and
panniculitis.

CT abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Partially occluded portal vein thrombosis which is new when
compared to
prior exam.
2. Cirrhotic-appearing liver with ascites, recanalized umbilical
vein,
splenomegaly.
3. Gallbladder sludge and wall thickening, the latter is likely
due to
chronic liver disease. No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
4. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
.
CXR
Right PICC tip is in the right brachiocephalic vein. There is no
evident
pneumothorax. No other interval change.
.
CXR: FINDINGS: The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The
prominence of the upper zone blood vessels seen on yesterday's
examination shows improvement.
CONCLUSION: No definite pneumonia identified.
.
EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Baseline artifact.
Lead V1 is not recorded. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2144-9-29**] the rate has slowed. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim
change.

Brief Hospital Course:
65yo female with multiple medical problems including Type 2
Diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity, and pulmonary embolism was
admitted with fevers of unclear etiology.
.
Panniculitis: Source of fever was found to be ride sided
panniculitis.  She was started on clinda/vanco and ID was
consulted.  Her antibiotics were narrowed to vancomycin/  A PICC
was placed in the midline position.  As she continued to
improve, she completed a 10 day course of vancomycin.
.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure/COPD exacerbation:
During the admission, she was found to be wheezy and was started
on nebulizers, azithromycin, and was given a course of steroids
in addition to her regular home COPD inhalers. She was ruled out
for influenza. In follow up, pt began to appear very somnolent,
and patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxemic and
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  She was managed with Bipap,
and was nearly intubated.  Her BNP was found to be severely
elevated, and she was diuresed with IV lasix with some
improvement in respiratory function.  Her respiratory failure
was felt to be multifactorial with elements of
