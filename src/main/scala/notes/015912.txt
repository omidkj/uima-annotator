History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64yo M w/ a PMHx of CAD s/p PCI X 2, most
recently [**7-18**], PAF not on coumadin, ESRD on HD,
hypercholesterolemia, COPD, CVA [**2107**] and [**3-18**], who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 7569**] for emergent cath s/p
STEMI. Patient reports that he developed aching chest pain and
diaphoresis this morning while laying on the couch. Pain was
mid-sternum, non-radiating. Patient reports he has not had this
in the past, although reports of prior chest pain and stents. +
Associated nausea and SOB. Lasted until arrived at OSH. Came to
[**Location (un) **] ED where vitals at triage were 96.7, HR 90, BP 141/68,
RR22, 98% on unknown O2. ECG showed ST elevations in II, V1-V4.
Pt underwent VF which terminated with shock X 1, this episode
was repeated 3 times in total. Was given Amio bolus and gtt
started. Started heparin gtt and was given Aggatroban gtt. Per
report, last dialysis was yesterday; however pt states it was
friday.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt underwent cardiac cath showing 70% LM
lesion, mid-LAD lesion with Vision BMS and 0% residual stenosis,
also dominal RCA wiht proximal occlusion and r-r and l-r
collaterals. LCx was non-dominant 50% lesion. Heparin and
aggrastat were stopped.

Currently, pt denies chest pain, SOB, nausea. No orthopnea or
PND. Walking limited by SOB but able to walk > 1 block without
stopping. Cannot tell me how many stairs he can climb. Denies
leg pain with ambulation. Denies edema or palpitations. Per
daughter, he has hx of CAD with prior MIs and stents at [**Hospital1 **], although pt denied prior CAD or MIs. Daughter reports
100lb weight loss over past 6 months due to anorexia and "not
feeling well" in the setting of dialysis.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES
EKG (from OSH): NSR at 80bpm, nl QRS axis, ST elevations in
V1-V4 with QRS .120 sec.

CARDIAC CATH ([**11-9**]):  1- Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system revealed three vessel disease with LMCA
involvement.  The LMCA had a 70% stenosis.  The LAD was occluded
in mid segment with proximal septal collaterals to the RCA.
There was heavy calcification in the LAD.  There was a large D1
and S1.  The LCX is a non-dominant vessel with origin
clacification and 50% lesion in the proximal portion.  The RCA
is a dominant vessel with occlusion proximally and r-r
collaterals and l-r
collaterals.
2- Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normal systemic
arterial blood pressure of 115/55 mmHg.
3- Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid totally occluded LAD
with
3.0x23 mm Vision BMS. Final angiography revealed 0% residual
stenosis with TIMI III flow.
4- Abdominal aortography with run off to the iliac arteries was
performed utilizing a Pegtail 5 French caheter positioned at L1.
The abdominal aorta had moderate diffuse calcification with
modest occlusive iliac disease and bilateral iliac aneurysms.
The renal arteries were patent.

TTE ([**11-10**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate to severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls, and
distal inferior wall. The apex is mildly aneurysmal and
dyskinetic. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Rt upper extrem US ([**11-10**]): IMPRESSION: Provided limited imaging
shows wide patency of the right radial artery with normally
triphasic waveforms as described above.

Carotid US ([**11-10**]): 1. Moderate-to-severe left ICA stenosis with
apparent interval progression since prior imaging. No
significant ICA stenosis on the right.
2. Antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.

CT torso ([**11-12**]): 1. Concentric wall thickening at the
rectosigmoid junction which in the setting of bright red blood
per rectum is concerning for possible malignancy. Recommend
endoscopic evaluation.
2. Enlarged subcarinal lymph node and borderline pretracheal
node.
3. Diffuse atherosclerotic calcification and aneurysmal
dilatation of the
right iliac artery.
4. Atrophic kidneys and bladder consistent with end-stage renal
disease.
5. Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine and healing pelvic
fractures.

CTA neck ([**11-12**]): Significant atherosclerotic disease involving
the carotid arteries  with 50% stenosis in the proximal cervical
internal carotid artery on the right and approximately 80-85%%
stenosis over a short segment in the proximal left cervical
internal carotid artery. No flow limitation distally.

Flex sigmoidoscipy ([**11-13**]): Erythema in the recto-sigmoid. No
mass seen. In the setting of circumferential thickening seen on
CT scan, this finding is possibly secondary to ischemia that has
partially healed. This was most likely the etiology of the
patient's bleeding, however, we cannot rule out lesions
elsewhere in the GI tract.  Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to
sigmoid colon at 30 cm

Cardiac cath ([**11-17**]):
1.  Access via left femoral artery as the RFA had been
used last week.  The artery was very calcified but access was
without
complications.
2.  Limited hemodynamics with BP 113/46 with HR 65 in sinus
3.  Angiography of t
