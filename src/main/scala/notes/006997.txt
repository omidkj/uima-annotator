Final Report
HISTORY: Right effusion, to evaluate for change.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-1**], the right chest
tube remains
in place. Again there is a small pneumothorax in the axillary
region and
stable right pleural effusion with atelectatic change at the
base. The
remainder of the study is unchanged.

Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  25% to 30%  >= 55%
Aorta - Ascending:  3.4 cm  <= 3.4 cm
Aorta - Descending Thoracic:  2.4 cm  <= 2.5 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).

MITRAL VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed mitral valve leaflets.
Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
There is a fistula between the aorta and the LA. It arises from
the sinus of Valsalva at the left cusp, tracks by the
non-coronary cusp and enters the LA.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
RV shows mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The leaflets
all move but are thickened. There is a peak gradient of 42 mmHg
across it.
The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is on an epinephrine infusion.
There is a well-seated and functioning mitral valve prosthesis.
No leak, no MR.
There is a prothetic aortic valve, also well-seated and with no
leak or AI. The residual aortic valve mean gradient is 9 mmHg.
RV systolic fxn is mildly depressed.
LV systolic fxn is moderately depressed. EF remains 30 - 35%.
Ascending and descending aorta intact.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt. was admitted to the CVICU and was fully cultured.  He
was continued on his Daptomycin and cardiology and ID were
consulted.  He had a TEE which revealed 4+MR, vegetations on the
AV and MV, a paravalvular leak, and an aortic-[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] with
abscess.  He had also had severe back pain and had a spine MRI
which showed    possible discitis at T4-T5 and a question of
discitis osteomyelitis at L3-L4 and possible L1-L2. On [**7-18**] he
underwent Redo sternotomy, AVR(23 mm porcine)/MVR(29 mm
porcine)/closure of aorto-[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  The cross clamp time was
170 mins. and total bypass 215 mins.  He tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the CV ICU on Nitro and Epi in
stable condition.

His renal function deteriorated and he became oliguric.  CVVH
was begun on POD 3 after a renal consultation.  He was
extubated, then re intubated on POD #1 after only 11 minutes
extubated. He went into A Fib with hypotension on POD #2 and was
cardioverted to SR. Bronchoscopy done POD #2 for secretions and
RLL collapse. Chest tubes also removed.  Cardioverted again
unsuccessfully on POD #4 but was not hypotensive. Cardiology
consulted. Repeat bronch done POD #5. He remained stable and off
pressors. He was making some urine and CVVH was converted to HD.
After the treatment the dialysis catheter was removed and
dialysis not required subsequently He was cultured for sternal
drainage on POD #6 and ID re consulted. He was extubated again
on POD #7. Haldol was given for agitation. The lower end of the
sternal incision was opened and cultured negative on POD #8. A
PICC line was also placed. Meropenem was started for pseudomonas
in the urine.

Postoperatively he had severe confusion in the ICU which
responded to Haldol and cleared over several days. He has
remained intact and Haldol has been reduced.

He was transferred to the floor on POD # 13, but transferred
