History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 year-old Female with a h/o CAD (remote MI in [**2094**]'s
medically managed), diastolic heart failure, hypertension;
ascending aortic dissection, type A, s/p hemiarch aortic
replacement, resuspension of aortic valve commissures and
reapproximation of dissected aortic layers on [**2120-7-12**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 112**], also with known descending aortic aneurysm, type
B, that has been folowed at the [**Hospital1 112**] radiographically since at
least [**2121**], who presented to the ED with a month of RLQ pain
that has been radiating to the groin, but now also to the lower
back. The pain is constant, improve with meals (leading her to
switch from eating 3 large meals a day to eating multiple small
meals throughout the day). She report h/o severe constipation
(been on colace, senna, dulcolax and enema). A new laxative was
given to her by PCP 3 days ago, which she has not had a chance
to use. She reports last BM about a day ago, passing flatus and
also some burping, with accompaning nausea. Denies any BRBPR or
melena.
.
The on [**2125-9-20**], she was evaluated in the ED for similar pain.
Patient had an ultrasound of the pelvis which showed fibroid
uterus. Ovaries were not visualized. She also had CT A/P non-con
on [**2125-9-20**] which only showed nonobstructing 4 and 6 mm right
renal stones. In comparison, today CT torso was obtained which
showed the descending type B aortic dissection extending from
just beyond the subclavian artery to iliacs. The great vessels
are not compromised. The true lumen feeds celiac artery,
superior mesenteric artery and right renal artery. The false
contain thrombus with dystrophic calcifications. The false lumen
feeds left renal and inferior mesenteric artery. In comparison
to the reports available to us, the dissection is unchanged from
prior. Prior images were not available for viewing from [**Hospital1 112**].
.
In ED, she c/o chest pain in the ER around 3PM, hypertensive to
sbp > 200. ECG was notable for NSR at 55 with Q's in III, F with
0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevation and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in I and L. Pain
improved with 2 SLNTG, Aspirin 325mg, Ondansetron and Morphine
Sulfate. BP at the time was elevated up to 180/90. She was also
started on a nitro gtt for BP control. She does get angina
occasionally, last time in [**2125-3-13**] which responds to SLNTG.
Repeat ECG after being pain free was similar. She was
premedicated (benadryl, solumedrol, famotidine) for the CTA as
she reports and allergy to IV constrast. Few hours later she
recieved Morphine Sulfate 4mg twice, Labetalol 100 mg, and
placed on nitro gtt for BP control. Patient was evaluated by
cardiology in the ED. Bedside TTE was done and did not show any
wall motion abnormalities, no pericardial effusion and no gross
valvular abnormalities. The coronary ischemia was rulled out by
cardiac markers and EKG. She was seen by Cardiology and vascular
surgery, who recommended admission to the medicine for BP
control.
.
CT imaging of the abdomen/pelvis non-contrast on [**2125-9-20**] which
only showed non-obstructing 4 and 6-mm right renal stones. A
non-contrast CT torso in the ED on this presentation was
reportedly consistent with reports from prior imaging at [**Hospital1 112**]
(actual images were not obtained). In the ED, she was
hypertensive, for which a Nitro gtt was initiated (with SBP >
200 mmHg). Her EKG was notable for NSR at 55 with Q's in III,
AVF with 0.5-mm ST elevation and 1-mm ST depression in I and
AVL. A bedside TTE was done and did not show any wall motion
abnormalities, no pericardial effusion and no gross valvular
abnormalities. Cardiac enzymes were negative. In the MICU, CTA
torso with contrast was performed and was also consistent with
written reports from prior imaging studies, with no acute
changes.
.
Nitro gtt was weaned off on [**10-15**] in the AM (8 am), with mean SBPs
in 100-130s systolic, HR 60-70s. She denies chest pain,
shortness of breath; no vision changes or headaches. Her AM dose
of Lisinopril of 5 mg was dosed this morning. Labetalol 200 mg
PO, Captopril 12.5 PO TID were initiated this AM.
