HISTORY:   Baby Girl [**Name2 (NI) 38446**] [**Known lastname 38330**]-[**Known lastname **], triplet number 3,
admitted to the Special Care Nursery from Labor and Delivery for
management of prematurity.

Mother is a 27-year-old gravida II, para I now IV woman, with
spontaneous triplet gestation.  Prenatal screens included
blood type O positive, antibody screen negative, RPR
nonreactive, rubella immune, hepatitis B surface antigen
2.  Intrauterine growth restriction of triplet number two due
to twin-to-twin transfusion
3.  Pregnancy-induced hypertension.
She completed a course of betamethasone prior to delivery.
Delivered by cesarean section for worsening pregnancy-induced
hypertension.  This triplet emerged active, crying, with a
heart rate greater than 100, given CPAP then intubated around
five minutes of age due to extreme prematurity and
respiratory distress.  Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at one and
five minutes respectively.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, weight 600 grams (25th
percentile), length 30.5 cm (10th percentile), head
circumference 22.5 cm (10 to 25th percentile).  Active, pink
infant, anterior fontanel soft, flat, left eye fused, right
eye slightly open, no clefts.  Breath sounds with good
aeration, slight crackles.  Regular rate and rhythm without
murmur.  Abdomen soft, nondistended, no hepatomegaly, no
masses.  Moves extremities well.  Spine intact, no dimple.
Neurologic:  Appropriate for gestational age.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Respiratory:  Received two doses of Survanta following
admission for respiratory distress syndrome.  Initial
ventilator support pressures 20/5, rate of 20, 25%.  On day
of life eight, was changed to high-frequency oscillatory
ventilation due to increasing ventilator support and bloody
secretions.  Maximum mean airway pressure 17.  Changed to
conventional ventilation on day of life 34, with maximum
support pressures 28/6, rate of 36, around 30 to 40%.  Weaned
to CPAP on day of life 84, then to nasal cannula on day of
life 92, to room air on day of life 144 ([**2149-6-30**]).  Recent blood
gas on [**7-6**] had a pH of 7.37, PCO2 54, PO2 39.

Hospital course notable for persistence of right upper lobe
opacity with development of necrotizing staphylococcus aureus
pneumonia.  A bronchoscopy was done x 2 for pulmonary toilet
due to staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.  The right main stem
bronchus and segmental bronchi to the right lower, middle and
upper lobes were noted to be occluded with purulent
secretions.  During the bronchoscopy, large mucous plugs and
pus were removed.  The infant was given aerosolized
tobramycin and Pulmozyme during the procedure.

Started diuretic therapy with lasix then Diuril alone for
chronic lung disease on day of life 34.  Remains on Diuril
therapy.

Received caffeine citrate from day of life 38 to day of life
52.  Last bradycardia and desaturation was on [**2149-5-30**].

2.  Cardiovascular:  Was treated for hypotension following
delivery with normal saline bolus x 2, then dopamine
infusion.  Received dopamine from day of life zero to day of
life four.

Treated with dopamine again following patent ductus
arteriosus ligation from day of life 22 to day of life 30.
Additionally treated with four stress doses of
hydrocortisone.  Once again required dopamine infusion from
day of life 54 to day of life 70 due to staphylococcus aureus
sepsis pneumonia.

A patent ductus arteriosus was treated with two courses of
Indocin without closure, requiring patent ductus arteriosus
ligation at [**Hospital3 1810**] on [**2149-2-27**] (day of life 21).

3.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Initially maintained
on D-5-W, then total parenteral nutrition.  Received fluids
by umbilical catheters initially, then by
percutaneously-inserted central catheter.  Started trophic
feeds on day of life five, and advanced to 20 cc/kg/day on
day of life nine.  Feedings were stopped on day of life ten
due to increased respiratory support and question of
infection.  Feeds were restarted again on day of life 30, and
advanced to full feeds on day of life 39.  Caloric density
was gradually increased to 32 calories/ounce with ProMod with
feeding tolerance.  Was placed nothing by mouth again on day
of life 52 secondary to staphylococcus aureus sepsis
pneumonia and hypotension.  Remained nothing by mouth until
day of life 70, when feeds were restarted.  Advanced to full
feeds on day of life 82, then calories were increased to 32
calories/ounce by day of life 92.  Due to nutritional
rickets, was given 6 calories/ounce of human milk fortifier
for additional calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D.  Currently
is taking 150 cc/kg/day of breast milk enhanced with 4
calories/ounce of Neosure to equal 24 calories/ounce.

Is receiving all feeds by gavage due to microaspiration and
discoordination of suck, swallow.  Has been gaining weight
well.  Receiving supplemental potassium chloride secondary to
diuretic therapy.  Most recent electrolytes on [**2149-7-6**] showed
a sodium of 136, potassium 4.9, chloride 98, and CO2 of 26.
Nutritional laboratories done on [**6-18**] showed a calcium of
9.7, phosphorus 6.3, albumin 3.9, alkaline phosphatase 475.
The maximum alkaline phosphatase on [**5-9**] was 1503.

Discharge weight 3915 grams (50 to 75th percentile), length
51 cm (50 to 75th percentile), head circumference 35.5 cm (50
to 75th percentile).

4.  Gastrointestinal:  Received phototherapy for indirect
hyperbilirubinemia.  Peak bilirubin total 4.6, direct .3.

Developed direct hyperbilirubinemia around ten weeks of life
secondary to cholestasis associated with prolonged total
parenteral nutrition without enteral feeding.  Highest direct
bilirubin 6.1.  Was treated with phenobarbital and Actigall
from day of life 91 to day of life 126.  Recent bilirubin on
[**6-18**], total .8, direct .4.

A video fluoroscopic swallow study was done on [**6-4**] showing
silent aspiration of thin and thick liquid with significant
discoordination of suck, swallow and breathe sequence.  Has
been receiving only gavage feedings since that time. Gastrostomy
tube placed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 38447**] [**2149-7-1**]. Had a moderate to large
umbilical hernia, repaired during G tube placement on [**2149-7-1**].

Anti-reflux medication (Reglan and Zantac) initiated post-op.

5.  Hematology:  Infant's blood type is B positive.  Received
a total of 16 packed red blood cell transfusions during this
hospitalization.  The last packed red blood cell transfusion
was on [**2149-4-21**].  A recent hematocrit on [**2149-6-24**] was 37.4%, with
a reticulocyte count of 1.7%.  Is receiving supplemental
iron.

Received a platelet transfusion on [**2149-3-5**] for a platelet
count of 77,000.  Thrombocytopenia was due to sepsis and
resolved after one transfusion.

6.  Infectious Disease:  Received a 48 hour course of
ampicillin and gentamicin following birth for rule out
sepsis.  CBC was normal.  Blood culture was negative.
Received  48 hours of vancomycin and gentamicin from day of
life eight to day of life ten for rule out sepsis with a
negative blood culture and benign CBC.  Received vancomycin
and gentamicin then switched to oxacillin for a total of
seven days of therapy from day of life 26 to day of life 32
for a tracheal aspirate that grew staphylococcus aureus.
Blood cultures was negative at that time.  Received
vancomycin and gentamicin changed to oxacillin and gentamicin
for 32 days, then completed a total of 42 days with oxacillin
for staphylococcus aureus sepsis and pneumonia.

7.  Orthopaedics.  Seen by Orthopaedics from [**Hospital3 18242**] on [**2149-4-30**] for decreased movement of the left leg.
Was diagnosed with multiple fractures secondary to
nutritional rickets that included fractures of bilateral
proximal femurs, bilateral proximal humerus, and left distal
radius and ulna.  Had a normal hip ultrasound on [**2149-5-28**].
Xrays done day prior to d/c for baseline; copies given to
parents.

8.  Neurology:  Head ultrasound was done on day of life one,
six, 11, one month, and 36 weeks corr
