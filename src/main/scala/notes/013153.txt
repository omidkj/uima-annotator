Service:  [**Location (un) 259**] MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old
woman, a resident of [**Hospital3 **] Facility, with
end-stage dementia, diabetes mellitus, and multiple other
medical problems, who presented to [**Hospital6 649**] with a history of lethargy, cough, fever, and
shortness of breath.

According to the [**Hospital 228**] [**Hospital3 **] chart, the
patient had several recurrent temperatures to 101?????? and 102??????
over the two weeks prior to admission which were attributed
to her stage 3 sacral decubitus ulcers; the patient had been
treated with Levofloxacin and Flagyl for some time.

On the day prior to admission, the patient's Flagyl was
changed to Clindamycin.  Over the few days prior to
admission, the patient exhibited increased lethargy, as well
as increased shortness of breath.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
further management.

LABORATORY DATA:  On presentation CBC revealed a white count
of 24.8, a hematocrit of 33.5, platelet count 417,000; CHEM7
revealed a sodium of 139, potassium 5.5, chloride 100, bicarb
25, BUN 45, creatinine 1.0, glucose 527; coag studies
revealed PT 14.1, PTT 24, INR 1.3; urinalysis revealed large
blood and nitrite positive, 22 red blood cells, 6 white blood
cells, occasional bacteria; blood cultures were sent with 1
out of 2 bottles coming back positive for diphtheroids, this
was presumed to be contaminant, although it would have been
covered by subsequent antibiotic treatment; ABG revealed a pH
of 7.53, pCO2 38, pO2 52.

Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm in the 80s with a
normal axis, normal [**Doctor Last Name 1754**], normal intervals, U-wave, early
transition, 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] depression in leads II, III, and AVF.

Chest x-ray revealed right lower lobe and left lower lobe
infiltrates.

Other studies of note were a recent echocardiogram from
[**2174-6-30**], which revealed an ejection fraction of 60%,
2+ mitral regurgitation noted, as was a small to moderately
sized pericardial effusion, there were no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade, there was no significant change from a
prior echocardiogram of [**2174-6-27**].

Urine culture taken on admission later revealed growth of
Proteus mirabilis.

Wound culture from the patient's decubitus ulcer grew out
MRSA.  Sputum culture from [**2174-8-8**], grew out
Proteus mirabilis and MRSA.

Stool studies from [**2174-8-8**], revealed positive
Clostridium difficile.


Blood cultures from [**2174-8-8**], were negative for any
growth.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, the patient
was noted to be in respiratory distress (please above noted
arterial blood gas), and the patient was also found to be
hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure running in the
60s.  The patient was intubated emergently and started on
Dopamine after which her systolic blood pressure rose to the
90s and 100s.  The patient was admitted directly into the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.

The [**Hospital 228**] medical Intensive Care Unit course is notable
for the following events:

The patient was started on Vancomycin 750 mg IV q.24 hours,
as well as Flagyl 500 mg per PEG tube q.8 hours on the
evening [**8-7**] and the morning of [**8-8**].

[**8-7**] through [**8-8**], a left IJ was placed.  The
patient was weaned off pressors.  The patient spiked a
temperature to 103??????.

[**8-8**] through [**8-9**], the patient's systolic
blood pressure dipped again down into the 70s, and thus she
was restarted on pressors.

[**8-9**] through [**8-10**], the patient was again
weaned off pressors.  She was also ruled out for myocardial
infarction by serial enzymes.  A hematocrit drop over the
previous several days from 33.5 to 27.8 to 25.9 prompted a
transfusion of 2 U of packed red blood cells with an
appropriately elevated hematocrit thereafter.  The patient
also spiked a temperature to 101??????.  The patient was found to
be C-diff colitis positive and was continued on Flagyl.

[**8-10**] through [**8-11**], the patient was found to
have MRSA from her decubitus ulcer culture.  Sputum grew out
Proteus mirabilis and MRSA.  The patient was started on
Ampicillin 2 g IV q.12 hours on [**8-11**].

[**8-11**] through [**8-12**], the patient had a brief
episode of hypotension with systolic blood pressure running
in the 80s.

On [**8-13**], the patient was extubated.

On [**8-14**], the patient had an oxygen saturation of 99%
on shovel mask and was subsequently transferred to the
Medicine floor.

While on the Medicine floor, the patient's above noted
antibiotics were continued.  Also, a PICC line was placed on
the evening of [**2174-8-16**].  Subsequently the
patient's left IJ was pulled.  During the patient's course on
the Medical floor, she remained afebrile, and her white count
remained in the normal range.  She was noted to have some
hyponatremia to 131.  Otherwise, her course was stable, and
she continued to do well on oxygenation by mask.
