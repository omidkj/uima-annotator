History of Present Illness:
76 year old woman with history of seizure disorder, chronic
respiratory failure due to combination of pneumonia and poly
neuropathy referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation following potential
seizures and transient pulseless arrest. Prior to these events
(per her son), she was able to do breathing trials for several
hours at at time, mouth and speak words, move all 4 extremities,
and get OOB to chair. She was at [**Hospital **] Rehab on [**2115-4-10**] when
her vent started to alarm for desats to 60%. She was found to
have emesis around her trach site. She was suctioned then lost
her pulse on peripheral monitoring. She was pulseless for less
than a minute. She had spontaneous return of circulation. She
continued to have vomiting later that day with some blood seen.
She per report recovered to near her baseline according to her
son. She was started on timentin/flagyl. Also of note early on
[**2115-4-10**] she pulled out her foley with the baloon still inflated
and had subsequent hematuria. However in the morning of the day
of admission she was witnessed to have a seizure while being
cleaned. She recovered consciousness then had another seizure.
Keppra was started prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  She was admitted
to the ICU given chronic vent dependence.
.
Of note she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 77923**] for altered
mental status, pneumonia complicated by critical illness
neuropathy and had trach/G placed due to inability to wean from
the vent. She had 3 sequential days of EEG monitoring without
any events captured and only changes consistent with
encephalopathy were noted. In her discharge, her condition was
listed as "Ventilator dependent. Follows simple midline and
appendicular commands. Right CN VII palsy (chronic post polio)-
unable to close R eyelid. Upper extremities barely [**2-20**]
(antigravity) + motor impersistence. Withdraws lower extremities
to noxious stimulation in the plane of the bed. Intact deep
tendon reflexes throughout."
In the ED her initial vitals were 99.9 68 126/65 100% AC 450x14
60% PEEP 8.
She received NS bolus for transient sbp in mid 80s. Her lactate
was normal. She received vanc/ceftriaxone/azithromycin directed
at a pneumonia. Her EKG was interpreted as unchanged from
priors. Her ED course was notable for transient desat to 80%.
She was suctioned with moderate amount of mucous then returned
her sats to 100%.

EtoH. has 2 children.  Since previous hospitalization has been

Echocardiogram [**2115-5-3**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-2-28**],
there is now severe RV systolic dysfunction with significant
tricuspid regurgitation and moderate to severe pulmonary
hypertension. There is a large pleural effusion.

Lower extremity ultrasound
Slightly limited evaluation as described above, but no evidence
of DVT
bilaterally. Absence of DVT in no way excludes the presence of a
PE.


Initial EEG

ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording the background was slow
and
disorganized, typically in the 6 Hz frequency range in the
posterior
regions bilaterally and was interrupted by intermittent bursts
of
moderate amplitude
