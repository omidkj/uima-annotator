DISCHARGE LABS:
CBC:13.3/15.5/45.1/287
Chem 7: 142/3.7/102/30/54/1.2/123

IMAGING:
PROCEDURE: CTA chest with and without contrast on [**2166-11-10**].
.
COMPARISON: [**2165-6-3**].
.
TECHNIQUE: Pre- and post-contrast examination of the thorax with
contiguous
axial images from the thoracic inlet to the subdiaphragmatic
area, coupled
with sagittal/oblique and coronal reformatted images.
.
HISTORY: 74-year-old woman with hypoxemia and tachycardia,
please evaluate
for PE.
.
FINDINGS:
.
The pulmonary arteries are well visualized up to the first
segmental level
showing no PE. Beyond that the opacification is faint and so no
peripheral PE can be excluded. The aorta is unremarkable in
size, showing no evidence of dissection or aneurysmal
dilatation.
.
Stable coronary calcifications are again seen. The heart size is
within
normal limits. Mitral annular valve calcification is stable.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
.
The lungs have relatively cleared as previously there was
diffuse tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] nodularity, indicative of an infectious
process. However, there are persistent prominent lymph nodes in
the mediastinum and hilar areas stable to slightly increased in
size on today's examination. For example, the subcarinal lymph
node which is 9.3 mm is stable in size while the 5.4-mm left
prevascular lymph node was previously 4.6 mm in size.
.
Mitral annular valve calcification is stable.
.
New minimal bibasilar atelectasis is seen in both lung fields.
.
The bony structures do not show any lesion suspicious for
malignancy, however, there are significant disc osteophyte
complexes seen at multiple thoracic vertebral body levels better
appreciated in the sagittal reformatted images.
.
In the abdomen, stable subcentimeter right adrenal adenoma is
noted. No other abnormalities are seen.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Negative examination for PE in the major and first segmental
branches.
2. Almost complete resolution of the infectious process seen in
both lungs.
3. Persistent but slightly increased bilateral lymphadenopathy.
4. Stable pulmonary artery calcifications.
5. Stable right adrenal adenoma.
.
.
CHEST XRAY [**2166-11-9**]:
HISTORY: 74-year-old female with shortness of breath.
.
COMPARISON: None available.
.
PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The heart size is normal and
the aortic
contour mildly unfolded. The lungs are well expanded, and note
is made of
patchy infiltrate in the left lung base. No evidence of
pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is seen. Degenerative
changes are noted along the visualized thoracic spine.
.
IMPRESSION: Patchy infiltrate in the left lung base could be
consistent with pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 74 yo F with PMH of DM, COPD, and hx of foot osteo
admitted with respiratory distress,  found to have UTI and
question of lingular PNA.  Initially managed in MICU with
non-invasive ventilation support, steroids, and antitbiotics and
transferred to the floor once no longer requiring ventilation
support.  On floor patient was continued on po steroids and
antibiotics for UTI and concern for lingular PNA.  Patient
continued to require oxygen therapy and was discharged to rehab
in stable condition with O2, steroid taper and antibiotics.
Patient was also counseled for smoking cessation.
.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
Pt found by EMS with 02 sat 60% at home, improved with
initiation of CPAP.  Patient initially managed in MICU and then
on floor with po steroids and antibiotics.  She continued to
require oxygen, which was a change from her home status so there
was a concern for PE.  CTA was done and showed no central PE.
Her lung exam improved as did her symptoms however she continued
to need oxygen and it was determiend she needed home O2 and was
discharge on it.
.
FEVER:
Febrile on initial presentation with a negative workup.  No
clear infiltrate on CXR though concern for lingular PNA and was
treated with 7 day course of po levofloxacin.
.
UTI:
Found on screening UA, pan-sensitive E. coli, treated with 7 day
course of levofloxacin.
.
DIABETES:
Continue home regimen of 70/30 28U QAM and 32 U QPM.
Fingersticks elevated with start of steroids, managed with SSI.

.
RIGHT HIP PAIN:
On admission,  pt with point tenderness over R hip bursa on
exam, no pain on ROM of hip.  Managed with home dose of Ultram.
.
PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY:
Continued home gabapentin.
.
CODE STATUS:
FULL per patient.
