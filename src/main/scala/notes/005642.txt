Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service. CT imaging of head and
spine revealed no acute hemorrhages or fractures. Orthopedic
spine surgery was initially consulted because of T12 compression
fracture noted on radiologic imaging; this fracture was deemed
old and no further intervention was required. Thoracic surgery
was consulted because of her left hemothorax; a chest
thoracostomy tube was placed. She remained in the Trauma ICU for
several days requiring intravenous narcotics for pain control.
Acute pain service was consulted for epidural catheter which was
placed; this seemed to help her pain as well. The epidural was
removed on HD#6; she was started on Tylenol ATC and prn
Oxycodone.

Lasix was resumed because of failure on chest X-Ray and history
of CHF, a foley catheter remains in place to monitor urine
output it may be removed once CHF status has improved.

Physical and occupational therapy were consulted and have
recommended a short term rehabilitation facility.
