Chief Complaint:
N/V, poor PO intake x2-3 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 10446**] is an 84 year old woman with severe aortic
stenosis and subsequent diastolic and systolic CHF, also with
Rheumatoid Arthritis, coagulopathy on standing vitamin K, who
presented on [**8-25**] with nausea, vomiting, and poor PO intake. In
the ED, she was found to have stable vital signs but acute renal
failure (creatinine 3.4), hyperkalemia (5.8), and acutely
elevated LFT's (ALT 1253, AST 2409, LDH 2200). Ultrasound was
consistent with acute hepatitis, without evidence of vascular
throbmosis or cirrhosis. KUB was without evidence of any bowel
obstruction. She was sent to the ICU for monitoring given
concerning lab values, although hemodynamically she was never
unstable.
.
In the MICU she was hydrated and her diuretics were held. Her
hyperkalemia was managed with insulin, calcium gluconate,
kayexalate and albuterol nebs. Her K slowly improved. Surgery
team evaluated the abd CT which did not show evidence of
obstrucion or ischemia despite elevated lactate of 5. Liver was
consulted and thought her transaminitis was either due to
autoimmune hepatitis vs. toxin induced. Renal was also consulted
and thought her renal failure might be AIN given her ingestion
of NSAIDs prior to admission, and by report they saw Eos in her
urine. Over her stay, creatinine and transaminases trended down.
Her N/V abated. She developed crackles 2 days into her
hospitalization but did not require supplemental O2. She was
deemed stable and transferred to the floor today.

[**2185-8-25**] Liver U/S:
IMPRESSION: Mild hyperemia and gallbladder wall thickening of a
non-distended gallbladder is likely secondary to hepatitis or
third spacing. Acute cholecystitis is not favored.
.
[**2185-8-25**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:  Improvement with resolution of previously noted
pleural
effusions.  No frank failure or consolidation noted.  Stable
massive
cardiomegaly as above.
.
[**2185-8-25**] KUB:
FINDINGS:  There is no free intraperitoneal air.  The stomach is
gas
distended.  No dilated loops of small bowel are evident.  There
is minimal stool noted likely in the region of the cecum.  Stool
is also noted in the sigmoid and rectal region.  The descending
colon is collapsed.
IMPRESSION:  No free air.  Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.
.
[**2185-8-26**] CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Liver demonstrates diffuse hypodensity. However, since the
ultrasound performed on [**2185-8-25**], did not demonstrate any
fatty change within the live, this appearance is suggestive of
hepatitis. Small amount of ascites is surrounding the liver.
Generalized anasarca is also visualized.
2. The duodenum is significantly thickened. This appearance
might be due to intramural hematoma or due to inflammatory
changes in adjacent structures like pancreatitis/hepatitis.
3. Small hypodense area between pancreatic head and duodenum
likely representing a tiny amount of fluid.
3. Stable appearance of calcified mesenteric cyst within the
right lower quadrant area.
4. Stable appearance of fluid-containing right inguinal hernia.
5. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
6. Severe degree of mitral annulus calcification.

Brief Hospital Course:
AP: 84 yo F with severe AS, mod-severe MR/TR, diastolic CHF c/b
hepatic congestion but with preserved EF (45-50%), now presents
with N/V, poor PO intake x 2 days, found to have acute hepatitis
and acute renal failure.
.
#. ARF: Pt with acute renal failure in setting of poor PO intake
and persistent lasix use (prerenal picture) vs. ATN with low UOP
vs. possible post obstructive etiology. Per pt she denied any
excessive NSAID use, she had been taking about 3 advils for her
back pain but nothing excessive. Her lasix regimen had recently
been increased since her d/c from her bowel resection
hospitalization in may to 80mg daily. Her PCP had decreased her
Lasixe and Spironolactone dose on Tuesday, 2 days prior to
admission. She was unable to take any meds 2-3 days prior to
admission due to persistent N/V. She was carefully hydrated
initially with 250cc bolus of 3amps NaHCO3 in D5W for a low HCO3
and metabolic acidosis. Renal was consulted who thought this was
possibly ATN vs. NSAID toxicity. Her UOP improved 3 days into
her hospitalization. A renal U/S did not show evidence of
hydronephrosis. She had a unimpressive UA and UCulture was
negative. She received a dose of Cipro 400mg IVx1 in the ED
which was not continued in the MICU. Her diuretics were held and
her Cr slowly improved. She was started on phos binders for
elevated Phos. She initially received insulin, calcium
gluconate, and kayexalate for HyperK-her EKG did not show
hyperacute T waves and she had no dysrhythmias on tele. On the
wards, her creatinine continued to trend downwards and was WNL
at 1.1 at time of discharge.
.
#. Hepatititis:  With levels that peaked at AST 3300, ALT 1700,
this differential diagnosis is narrow: Acute viral hepatitis vs.
toxic idiosyncratic drug reaction vs. tylenol overdose vs.
ischemia vs. autoimmune hepatitis. Pt with prior diagnosis of
hepatic congestion from CHF, so this may confound the picture.
