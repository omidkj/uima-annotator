CT Chest [**3-18**]
There are no large lung nodules that correspond to the chest
x-ray abnormality. There is bronchial wall thickening in the
lower lobes
bilaterally that might explain the abnormality and is due to
inflammatory
process.
Emphysema.
1-3 mm lung nodules. Followup in one year is recommended.

TTE 3.16
The left atrium is mildly dilated (5.4cm). Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Low normal left ventricular systolic function.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2170-8-10**], left ventricular function may be less
vigorous. The atrial sizes are larger. Estimated pulmonary
artery pressures are now lower.


Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY

71 M with Hx of CVA, HTN, DL presents with 3 weeks of
lightheadedness, falls and 1 day of palpitations. He was found
with a rate of 250 that did not break with adenosine. He has
been kept at 120's with diltiazem. He is admitted for workup and
management of his narrow-complex tachyarrythmia. There was
question as to whether he had atrial tachycardia or atrial
flutter. There was evidence (flutterform waves during carotid
sinus pressure) that his rhythm was flutter. On [**3-20**], he
converted to atrial fibrillation. We attempted to manage him
with nodal agents, but these only lowered his blood pressure (to
the 90's) while his heart rate was steady in the 120's. On [**3-20**],
with low BP and afib, he was transferred to the CCU for
TEE/cardioversion complicated by hypotension requiring transient
pressors. He was started on coumadin (with heparin bridge) and
amiodarone.

BY PROBLEM

1) SVT - Atrial Flutter and Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
   Hypotension

 The differential for his tachycardia was fairly narrow. It was
either atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter. Right carotid sinus
massage (very light pressure was sufficient) effected a decrease
in the ventricular response with a period of just flutter waves
that also showed atrial repolarization or an "a" wave.  His lack
of response to adenosine rules out PSVT. The tracings from the
OSH show a tachycardia to 260 with the same interval as the
space between p waves when he later ran at 130. A long strip
from the outside hospital additionally showed flutter waves. He
had flutter waves with carotid pressure and the interval between
QRSs is variable. He was in atrial flutter with variable
conduction. His risk factors are presumed COPD, alcoholism and
age. CHADS2 score is 3. We attempted to manage him medically
without conversion for the dual concern of stroke and bleeding
on anticoagulation (hx of UC and gastritis). After [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 102218**]
trial of betablockade from 25->75 mg [**Hospital1 **] metoprolol, his rate
did not change and he became hypotensive. The dose was halved to
37.5 and his hypotension persisted, concommittant with his
