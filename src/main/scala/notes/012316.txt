Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old female
with a history of ulcerative colitis, steroid-induced
diabetes with recent prolonged ulcerative colitis flare from
[**2183-10-26**] to [**2183-12-27**] treated with steroids,
Remicade, Asacol and 6-MP.  Patient was discharged home
stable and at follow up was seen to have liver function test
abnormalities and pancytopenia.  At that point the 6-MP was
discontinued.  She presented to an outside hospital at the
end of [**Month (only) 958**] with fevers and cough and was found to have
bilateral pneumonia by chest x-ray.  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for further management
of primary care physician.

HOSPITAL COURSE IN MICU:  1. Infectious disease/pulmonary:
The patient was found to have Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
by bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.  She was
initially treated with clindamycin and primaquine in the
setting of neutropenia and then changed to Bactrim after
treatment with Neupogen.  Now the patient is status post
21-day treatment with Bactrim and steroids.  She continued on
steroids for ulcerative colitis.  She was also found to have
MRSA pneumonia considered to be a ventilator acquired pneumonia
and started on vancomycin on [**3-3**] for a 14-day course.  She
also had methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis,
positive blood culture likely secondary to new line
infection, and her lines were changed on [**3-4**].  The
patient had a prolonged medical intensive care unit course
secondary to her pulmonary status, initially intubated one
day after treatment for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had difficulty weaning
secondary to continued hypoxia and increased suspicion for
acute respiratory distress syndrome.  Initial extubation on
[**3-7**] failed secondary to increased stridor.  Subsequent
extubation on [**3-9**] was without complications and
currently without an oxygen requirement.

2. GI:  The patient had a history of ulcerative colitis.  She
was relatively stable except for one episode of melanotic stool
in the setting of steroid taper, now stable on prednisone,
mesalamine and hydrocortisone enemas. Steroid  again being
tapered  slowly

3. Cardiovascular:  The patient had been transiently pressor
dependent, weaned successfully and noted to have persistent
sinus tachycardia with all obvious causes ruled out.  Heart
rate has been 110s to 130s.  Her blood pressure, hematocrit
and TSH were all within normal limits.

4. Hematology:  The patient required several transfusions
secondary to increased phlebotomy and episode of melena.  Her
hematocrit remained stable at the end of her medical
intensive care unit course.  She had initially received
Neupogen for her pancytopenia which responded well without
further decreases.

5. Psychiatry:  The patient had persistent delirium and
depression with increased tearfulness.  Psychiatry had been
following her.  She had an EEG which showed diffuse
encephalopathy.  No further work-up was done as the MICU team
felt the patient was improving. On the floor  she  was  found
to  have  no  delirium and  to be oriented  [**Last Name (un) 22121**] intact mental
status but profoundly depressed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Ulcerative colitis for many years.
2. Diabetes mellitus secondary to steroids.

ALLERGIES/MEDICATION TOXICITIES:  6-MP with pancytopenia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or alcohol.  She lives with her
husband.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  1. Mesalamine enemas.  2. Nystatin.
3. Miconazole.  4. Regular Insulin sliding scale.  5.
Vancomycin 1 gram q. 12, start date [**3-3**].  6.
Hydrocortisone enemas.  7. Prednisone p.o. 20 mg q. day.  8.
Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q.d.  9. Paroxetine 40 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Tube feeds.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer her temperature was 98,
heart rate 125, blood pressure 116/55, respiratory rate 36,
she was 98% on room air.  Her I's and O's were 2050/1150.  In
general she was a middle-aged female not verbal, minimally
responsive to questions but awake.  HEENT:  Positive thrush,
no neck stiffness.  Heart:  Tachycardic.  Lungs:  Clear
bilaterally with coarse breath sounds.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Bowel sounds were present.
Extremities:  Warm with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses, no edema.
Neurologic:  Minimal cooperation.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON TRANSFER:  White count of 8.7,
hematocrit 27.2, platelet count 170, sodium 139, potassium
3.3, chloride 103, bicarbonate 26, BUN 18, creatinine 0.4,
glucose 162, calcium 9.0, phosphorous 2.5, magnesium 1.7,
free calcium 1.25, vitamin B12 1,321, folate 8.0, ammonia 49,
TSH 0.94.  Arterial blood gases were pH 7.44, CO2 42, oxygen
159.  Her RPR was nonreactive.

She had an EEG on [**3-11**] which was an abnormal portal EEG
due to moderately slow background rhythm along with
occasional bursts of generalized slowing and some minimal
left temporal slowing consistent with widespread
encephalopathy affecting both the cortical and subcortical
structures.  Medications, metabolic disturbances and
infection are the most common causes.  Additional focal
slowing consistent with focal abnormality in the left
hemisphere, but this is less reliable.  Tachycardia was
noted.  No epileptiform features.

Cardiac echocardiogram on [**2-17**] showed normal left
ventricular cavity size, echocardiogram that was normal.

CT of the abdomen on [**2-22**] showed extensive consolidation
with ground glass opacity in the lung bases consistent with
PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 3754**] was no evidence of an intra-abdominal abscess,
small amount of free fluid in the pelvis, extensive
subcutaneous edema.

ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 56-year-old female with a
history of ulcerative colitis complicated by steroid
dependence and liver function tests abnormalities and
pancytopenia on 6-MP.  She was admitted with PCP complicated
by [**Name Initial (PRE) **] prolonged MICU course secondary to respiratory failure
with vent dependence, adult respiratory distress syndrome,
MRSA pneumonia, ulcerative colitis flare, severe delirium and
depression.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Infectious disease:  The patient was
continued on her full 14-day course of vancomycin for her
MRSA pneumonia as well as her methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia thought secondary to a
line infection.  The patient was also status post a 21-day
treatment with Bactrim and steroids for her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
Given that she would be continued on steroids for her history
of ulcerative colitis with difficulty weaning, we felt that
she should be placed on prophylactic Bactrim doses to help
prevent further episodes of PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day prior to her
discharge she had developed some lower abdominal tenderness.
A urinalysis was checked and it was found to be positive for
urinary tract infection.  Her urine culture was still pending
but at this time given that she had had a chronic Foley
catheter and has been hospitalized for over a month, we
discontinued her Foley catheter and continued a 14-day course
of levofloxacin.

2. Cardiovascular:  The patient had a history of an elevated
heart rate and persistent tachycardia with no clear etiology,
not hypovolemic, no significant anemia.  Her TSH was normal.
She was afebrile.  Her echocardiogram did not show any
evidence of right heart strain, less likely a PE.  Her oxygen
saturations were stable suggesting no evidence of hypoxia.
Given that she was in sinus tachycardia we did not treat her
with a beta blocker.  Her tachycardia may have been secondary
to anxiety.

3. Pulmonary:  The patient had been originally
hyperventilating when she first got to the floor but her
arterial blood gas did not show evidence of a respiratory
alkalosis.  This resolved as she continued to be monitored on
the floor with no further sequelae.

4. GI:  The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis.  She
had had one episode of melenic stool with tapering of her
steroids in the ICU suggesting a steroid dependence.  She was
actually tapered slightly from 20 to 15 mg p.o. q. day and
she was kept on this p.o. dose of
