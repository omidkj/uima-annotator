History of Present Illness:
64M HTN who presents with anorexia,weight loss, diarrhea and
malaise x 8 months (since [**2196-1-9**]).   He was treated with
Xiafaxin and asacol in [**Month (only) 956**] for bacterial overgrowth without
improvement. He was then hospitalized in [**State 108**] for
approximately 2 weeks at the end of [**Month (only) 956**] with hypotension,
dehydration, acute renal failure and electrolyte imbalances. He
was discharged on enterocort 9 mg qd from the hospital in
[**State 108**] in [**2196-3-8**] and with that he had had an improvement
down to 5-6 BMs so he was able to return to his home in NY.
Unfortunately his improvement did not last and he then presented
to his local hospital in [**Month (only) 547**] in NY with diarrhea ([**12-21**]
BM/daily) in [**2196-4-8**]. He was H pylori positive, prev pack
given in [**Month (only) 547**].  He was then treated wtih neomycin for bacterial
overgrowth. He was started on omeprazole for GERD. He was weaned
off enterocort and then re-developed sx of diarrhea, chills,
weakness, hypokalemia, and hypotension. Cdiff negative many
times.

Diagnosed with "refractory sprue at the end of [**Month (only) **]." His HLA
pattern is DQ2 negative, DQ8 positive. At the end of [**Month (only) **] he was
started on high dose prednisone 60 mg with good effect but it
resulted in abdominal cramps, and acid reflux/burning.   He then
had an octreotide/abdominal CT/capsule study/eteroscopy. During
this time he was on a gluten-free diet for three weeks without
any effect and thus resumed a regular diet in the middle of
[**Month (only) **]. He then started back on the gluten free diet at the end of
[**Month (only) **]. At this time ulcers were found in the small bowel and he
was thought to have IBD. These ulcers were biopsied and were
negative for amyloid, Crohns. On the high dose steroids he felt
very well for two weeks and he had a formed stool. He then
declined again despite continuing on the 60 mg prednisone until
he was readmitted [**2196-8-22**] with epigastric pain, electrolyte
abnormalities, hypotension, and diarrhea - he thinks it
increased to 10 BMS per day despite taking the entercort 9 mg po
qd which was recently increased to entercort 6 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**2196-8-18**]
without effect. RUQ ultrasound yesterday did not show evidence
of choledocholithiasis.
Of note when his sx first began he had minimal RLQ pain but
since starting on the different medications his RLQ pain has
worsened with all of the medications he is taking. This cramping
can occasionally precede a BM. His pain is also worsened with
eating.
He also has pain and diarrhea which awakens him from sleeping.
Per his wife he developed petechiae on his feet which improved.
No nausea or emesis. No recent foreign travel. No outdoor
activity. No pets.
Transferred her for evaluation by GI service/Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6665**] [**Name (STitle) 1356**].
