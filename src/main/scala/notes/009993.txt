Flagyl / Serax

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
cough, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 48497**] is a 51yo female with anxiety, depression
(multiple prior suicide attempts and ECT treatments), chronic
low back pain, Crohn's disease, OSA and
prior episode of ARDS and ICU stay following a narcotic overdose
a few years ago who presented to ED now after referral from PCP
after patient was complaining of worse shortness of breath an
cough. On further history, she  reports ~1 wk h/o increasing
SOB, DOE while walking upstairs from the basement where she
lives (lives in basement of parents home), and also endorses
cough productive of green phlegm and "thick snot,". She has no
documented fevers but states her mom felt she was "hot" and she
does mention a few episodes of sweats.
.
Patient was seen in the ED recently on [**6-23**] with c/o SOB, DOE,
and fatigue and diagnosed with a PNA on CXR and found to be
anemic. Her potassium was also low at 3.2. She was then seen in
follow-up by her PCP who noted O2 sat good at 97% on RA, RR 14,
but very lethargic feeling and tachypneic. She was later sent to
the ED.Initial ED vitals: 98.4F, HR 92, BP 109/63, RR 18 and
100% 4LNC. Blood pressure was noted to drop to 80/60 on multiple
reads and the patient was asymptomatic; she was given 2L IV's
and blood pressure only rose to 98/63. She was also given 1g of
Ceftriaxone. Her CXR was called as basilar opacities with
improvement in the LLL; highly atypical appearance but
multifocal PNA as leading diagnostic consideration. Also, her
Hct is noted to be persistently low at 28.6, slightly down from
usual baseline, hemoccult negative.
.
Oxygenation was noted to be 100% 4L then 100% RA and 96/54 p90
by leaving the ED. Of note, pt's last admissions from [**5-7**] to
[**5-9**] for Crohn's flare and she was restarted on Asacol as she
had not been taking it recently; she was noted to be dehydrated
and tachycardic in the ED. She was given IVF's and felt better.
Then admitted [**5-16**] to [**5-18**] for diarrhea and orthostatic
hypotension with SBP noted 90's on arrival to floor which
reportedly improved to nortensive with IVF's. OMR notes show
clinic visits with SBP's mostly 110-130's.
On the floor, her systolic blood pressures ranged from 112 to
151.
.
ROS: ROS as above, otherwise she complained of sore throat,
decreased PO intake, nausea, diarrhea, baseline abdominal pain,
constipation, fibromyalgia, bruising easily. ROS negative for
CP, palpitations, vision changes, dysuria
.

.
[**6-24**] CXR :IMPRESSION: The previously noted predominantly basilar
opacities have slightly improved particularly in the more
involved left lower lobe relative to the prior exam, however,
there is persistent opacity. The distribution and  appearance is
highly atypical but a multifocal pneumonia remains the leading
diagnostic consideration. Given worsening clinical status and
equivocal improvement of radiograph, consider CT scan for
further details.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 48497**] is a pleasant 51yo female with history
of anxiety, deression, stable Crohn's disease and prior episode
of ARDS with PNA following an overdose back in [**3-/2120**] who was
recently evaluated in the [**Hospital1 18**] Ed just days prior to this
admission and was taking antibiotics for a new PNA but after
refractory complaints of cough, dyspnea she was referred back to
ED for additional evaluation.
She had brief overnight stay in the ICU to monitor low blood
pressures which were ultimately fleeting in nature and then she
was transitioned to general medical team with some additional
questionable gestures concerning for suicidality during her stay
which prompted social work and psychiatry consults. Full
hospital course outlined in more detail below.
.

#Cough /mild dyspnea : A repeat CXR at time of admission
re-confirmed her LLL PNA with slight bibasilar element that
seemed to implicate the RLL as well. Slight improvement from
prior CXR a few days earlier. She had no fevers or significant
leukocytosis during this admission and her cough had slight
improvement. Blood cultures all negative. She was initially
treated with 1g of Ceftriaxone in the ED but the medical team
transitioned her to ongoing oral Levaquin to complete CAP
course, at time of discharge she had 2 more days of antibiotics
left. Mildly productive sputum was improving by time patient
left the hospital. Patient's minimal dyspnea complaints were
also attributed to her recent PNA. Given some additional
atypical interstitial markings on her CXR, which were difficult
to interpret amidst her bibasilar opacities from PNA, the
medical team was also questioning some underlying chronic
pulmonary process but opted to defer this workup to her PCP and
pulmonologist in the outpatient setting with the inpatient goal
being to treat her acute infection. O2 saturations were
consistently >98% on room air by time of discharge.
.
#Hypotension: Patient has baseline SBPs in low 100s range and
has minimal reserve for
