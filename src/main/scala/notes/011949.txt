Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Iodine / ciprofloxacin / Meperidine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
Congestive heart failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular pacer wire placement via mini left thoracotomy
[**2103-5-7**]
Right heart catheterization [**2103-5-24**]

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76 year old male with CAD s/p CABG x3 in [**2088**]
with redo CABGx3 in [**2091**], chronic systolic CHF with LVEF 45%
related to ischemic cardiomyopathy, AICD for prior ventricular
arrhythmias, diabetes mellitus type 2, and CKD (baseline cr
2.0).  He has recently been quite incapacitated by his heart
failure symptoms, and it was felt that he would benefit from
cardiac resynchronization.  A few months ago, an attempt was
made to pass a lead into the coronary sinus, but failed due to
adhesions.  He was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for placement of an
epicardial left ventricular lead.  He was supposed to see [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for that purpose, but was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 34**] CCU
with severe CHF exacerbation and renal failure due to recent
onset Afib.  He was cardioverted, but went back into AFib in an
hour.   He was subsequently started on Amiodarone for an
eventual repeat attempt at cardioversion.   He is now being
transferred to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service for CHF and AFib management
prior to surgical epicardial lead placement.

Of note, pt was also treated for UTI while at [**Hospital3 **].  He
was also noted to have hematuria while at OSH.  Pt is on 2L o2
at home and on transfer he is sating in mid to high 90's on 4L.
At OSH, he was noted to have INR of 8.9 with Cr of 4.4 (baseline
2.0).  His crit dropped from 35 to 28 on admission.  Last Crit
was 27.5, K+ 4.2, Cr was 3.4.  trops were neg x3 at OSH.  EKG at
OSH showed bradycardia with LBBB.  On admission to OSH had U/A +
for UTI.

On arrival to the floor, the patient reports moderate SOB, but
much improved since starting lasix drip at OSH.

Pt has a foley in place and a double lumen PICC.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
 He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ECHO: [**2103-4-26**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately depressed (LVEF = 35 %) secondary to: (1)
hypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior free wall,
posterior wall, and apex; (2) left ventricular mechanical
dyssynchrony; and (3) ventricular interaction resulting from
pressure and volume overload of the right ventricle. There is
considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
unavailable) of [**2096-4-11**], multiple cardiac structural and
functional lesions as described above are now seen.

EKG: [**2103-5-11**], post epicardial lead placement -
Atrial and ventricular pacing. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2103-5-7**] no significant change.
