Elective evaluation of hypoglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
60 year-old female with past medical history of diabetes
mellitus type II previously on insulin, hypertension, and s/p
right hip arthroplasty recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] s/p
mechanical fall, diagnosed with hairline fracture of the right
hip and eventually discharged home after insulin regimen changed
from baseline of NPH 20 units each morning to lantus 10 units at
night after she had a BG of 12 with loss of consiousness in the
hospital. Subsequently, she had episode of malaise and confusion
at home in the setting of poor POs. Called EMS, who measured FBS
39, treated with glucagon. She was then admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
([**2132-3-23**] - [**2132-3-26**]) for hypoglycemia. During that
hospitalization, a 4x5cm anterior LLQ mass was found. During
that hospitalization, insulin was stopped and pt started on
metformin 500 [**Hospital1 **] and prandin 0.5 qac. Pt states that when her
glucose was low, she felt nausea and then passed out; does not
recall feeling diaphoretic.
.
She was seen by [**Last Name (un) **], who is concerned that this tumor is
IGF-2 secreting based on her lack of need for insulin now (when
she had required insulin in the past) and morning hypoglycemia.

.
The pt states that since her last admission she has only been on
metformin, and her fingersticks have been ranging in the
100s-200s without any episodes of hypoglycemia
.
ROS: The pt denies diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain,
dysuria, hematuria, BRBPR, HA, f/c/s, weight changes,
diaphoresis, dizziness, CP, SOB, palpitations. She admits to
occasional emesis post-prandial, with last episode over 2 weeks
ago. She also admits to chronic ankle swelling.

Prior imaging studies:
MRI ABDOMEN [**2132-3-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
Anteriorly within the left pelvis is a mass measuring 4.7 x 4.5
x 5.0 cm, which is hypointense on T2 weighted images. No
internal fat is identified. No arterial-phase enhancement is
noted; mild peripheral enhancement surrounds a central
nonenhancing core. The mass is well circumscribed and adjacent
to the sigmoid colon. There is no parasitization of vessels or
relationship to pelvic arterial vasculature. IMPRESSION: 1.
Signal characteristics and morphology are suggestive of a tumor
of mesenchymal origin or, perhaps, a broad ligament fibroid.
Similarly, the morphology and enhancement pattern, as well as
the lack of regionally enlarged lymph nodes, favors a non
aggressive process.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 60 yo with a history of DMII, intermittent
hypoglycemia, and a LLQ mass who presents for evaluation of her
hypoglycemia.
.
# Intermittent Hypoglycemia: It is unclear if the patient has an
[**Name (NI) 41262**] secreting tumor in her LLQ to account for her symptoms.
Patient admitted for a fasting study for formal diagnosis.  The
patient had fingersticks q2h while glucose > 150, then q1 hour
when glucose < 150.  The plan was when her glucose was < 45, or
< 55 with symptoms, she would have blood drawn and sent for
glucose, insulin, pro-insulin, IGF-1, IGF-2, C-peptide,
b-hydroxyacetate, and sulfonylurea screen; and also send another
tube to the lab with the indication "Store the serum". The
patient never had hypoglycemia during her course and she refused
to finish the study.  Endocrine was aware and advised to draw
the labs before the patient left (as she had completed the
majority of the fast, ~ 68 hours).  All of the above labs need
to be followed as an outpatient by her endocrinologist and the
patient needs close follow-up with her endocrinologist as an
outpatient.  She was advised to resume her metformin and return
for recurrence of symptoms.
.
# LLQ mass: This mass appears benign on MRI, but there is
concern for it being IGF-2 secreting.  The patient was seen by
anesthesia and surgery and she will have pre-op testing on [**6-9**]
and her mass will be removed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**6-16**].
.
# DM2: The patient had her metformin held while performing
fasting study.  She remained asymptomatic and without the need
for any intervention during her course.  She will need close
follow-up of her sugars as an outpatient.
.
# HTN: The patient had poorly controlled blood pressure as an
inpatient.  Her enalapril was increased and amlodopine was
added.  She was sent home on the increased dose of enalapril,
and it was decided to hold the amlodopine and have her follow-up
with her primary doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 31258**] of her medications.
