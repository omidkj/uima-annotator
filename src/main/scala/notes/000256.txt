Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
CoreValve placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CoreValve placement
Repeat Right and Left heart catheterization
Temporary pacemaker placement

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old caucasian female with CAD, NSTEMI [**2189-5-6**] pulmonary
HTN, and known critical aortic stenosis (AoVA = 0.6cm2, EF 40%)
now symptomatic with increasing chest pain, SOB, and dizziness.

Patient had been seen in [**2185**] and declined surgical intervention
at that time.   She was also admitted for CHF exacerbation 20
lbs over her baseline in [**2189-5-13**] and considered for
valvuloplasty, however this was not done due to concerns
regarding significant aortic regurgitation.  She underwent a
complete evaluation for TAVI during the stay including carotid
ultrasound, presantine perfusion scan, dipyridamole stress, and
CT of the chest/ abdomen/ and pelvis.

Recently, the patient has been experiencing decline in her
functional status due to worsening SOB and lightheadedness and
is limited to walking to the bathroom. (Adapted from Aortic
Valve Service History & Physical)

At baseline, patient has a history of anxiety.

    NYHA Class: III

Aortic valve replacement was uneventful and the LVEDP was
measured at 33.  The patient required 2 units of PRBCs.

Upon arriving to the floor, patient became acutely dyspnic,
gasping for breath with saturations in the mid 80s.
Simultaneously, the patient had increased blood pressures
measured at 200s/100s by arterial line.  Initial ABG was drawn
and demonstrated 7.29/52/72 (pH/pCO2/pO2). An urgent chest x-ray
demonstrated acute pulmonary edema with no evidence of
pneumothorax and was treated with 40mg lasix IV. Echo showed
[**12-14**]+ AR/MR and mild paravalvular leak. Patient was given
albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments followed by 125mg
methylprednisolone and patient was put on a non-rebreather mask.
 Patient was also given 0.5mg morphine sulfate, 0.5mg lorazepam.

Repeat ABG demonstrated increasing academia and hypercarbia
(7.20/73/108) and patient was transitioned to BiPAP 15/5.

Repeat ABG after 30 minutes of BiPAP showed 7.40/ 40/97 and
patient was weaned off the BiPAP.

DISCHARGE LABS:

PERTINENT STUDIES:
TTE ([**2189-7-7**]): The left atrium is dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with basal
inferior and basal to mid lateral hypokinesis (LVEF= 50 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present. The transaortic
gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
very small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.
.
TTE ([**2189-7-8**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal inferior and basal to mid inferolateral
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50
%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size is mildly dilated and free wall motion is normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-7-7**],
the severity of tricuspid and mitral regurgitation have
increased. The trans-Corevalve gradient is higher while the
severity of aortic regurgitation is unchanged. Pericardial
effusion is smaller. The right ventricle appears mildly dilated.

.
TTE ([**2189-7-9**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). There is considerable
beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection
fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. A paravalvular aortic valve leak is present. Mild to
moderate ([**12-14**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
Cardiac Cath ([**2189-7-9**]):
1. Elevated LVEDP
2. Mild to moderate aortic insufficiency
3. No gradient across the Corevalve (no aortic stenosis)
4. Mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension (from diastolic
dysfunction)


Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old caucasian female with
CAD, NSTEMI [**2189-5-6**] pulmonary HTN, and known critical aortic

# COREVALVE
Patient's perioperative course was complicated by flash
pulmonary edema after 2 units PRBCs in the cath lab. She was
treated with diuresis and BiPAP, with succesful weaning onto
nasal canula.  24 hours after
