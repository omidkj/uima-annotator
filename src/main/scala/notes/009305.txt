Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the CVICU. He was started on IV heparin for
his mechanical AVR, with frequent hematacrit checks. His HCT was
stable and he was transferred to the floor.  He was started on
coumadin. He developed an ileus likely secondary to narcotic use
and and NGT was placed. Serial KUB showed improvement and the
NGT was removed and his diet was advanced succesfully. Scan
showed an abdominal intramuscular hematoma.Paracentesis done.
His INR on coumadin became supertherapeutic during his period of
not eating secondary to his ileus.Gentle diuresis continued.
His INR was allowed to drift down and then his coumadin was
restarted at a lower dose than he usually takes at home. IV
heparin started when his INR became subtherapeutic.Rehab
screening continued. His abdominal intramuscular hematoma was
monitored while coumadin dosing was adjusted.Nutritional consult
done to teach pt. about fluid restrictions.Bowel regimen started
for constipation.
Cleared for discharge to rehab on [**3-4**]. Target INR is 2.0-2.5
for mechanical valve and A fib. IV heparin is to continue until
INR 2.0 or greater. Pt. is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17025**] in
