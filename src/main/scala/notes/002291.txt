History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80259**] is a 76M with DM and cirrhosis who presented to an
OSH on [**5-3**] with 3d of lethargy, headache, and diarrhea. Patient
was reportedly well until the week prior to transfer when he
developed a watery diarrhea. Family noticed that he seemed to be
more lethargic toward the end of the week. Over the weekend,
complained of a frontal headache -- intense, unusual for him.
His headache worsened over the weekend and by [**5-3**] was severe.
Family noticed that gait was abnormal and he was "shuffling." He
felt shaky and cold, and had difficulty standing. At that point,
wife brought him to another hospital. No travel or known sick
contacts, but he had eaten a cheese/seafood dish which was
unusual for him. No n/v, abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia,
neck stiffness, photophobia, chest discomfort, dyspnea, dysuria.
Denies any travel.
.
At the OSH, empiric ceftriaxone, vancomycin, flagyl, and
acyclovir were initiated upon admission. His respiratory status
remained poor. He was intubated due to respiratory distress the
morning of [**5-4**]. He was started on pressors and admitted to the
CCU. Blood cultures subsequently grew out listeria, and
ampicillin was initiated on [**5-4**], ceftriaxone was continued.
.
Hemodynamically he improved and neosynephrine was weaned off by
[**5-6**] AM. Hospital course notable for Cr rise to 3.3, and
elevation of transaminases to 1000s. He underwent a paracentesis
on [**5-5**] with removal of 900cc of fluid. Albumin was initiated at
25mg [**Hospital1 **]. He was also found to have a troponin elevation to 17,
and echocardiogram showed an EF depressed to 15%. His mental
status remained poor. No LP was done. CXR and CT head were
apparently unremarkable, CT abdomen on admission showed ascites.

.
Given deteriorating liver and kidney function transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2134-5-7**] with lethargy,
headache, diarrhea, and confusion.

OSH COURSE:
He originally presented to an OSH on [**5-3**] with 3 days of these
symptoms.  He had developed watery diarrhea 1 week prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  His family noted that his gait was abnormal
and "shuffling."  At OSH, empiric ceftriaxone, vancomycin,
Flagyl, and acyclovir were initiated upon admission.  He was
intubated due to poor respiratory status on [**2134-5-4**] at OSH.  He
was started on pressors and admitted to the CCU.  Blood cultures
subsequently grew out listeria, and ampicillin was initiated on
[**2134-5-4**].  Ceftriaxone was continued.  Hemodynamically, he
improved at OSH, and neo synephrine was weaned off by [**2134-5-6**]
AM; however, his Cr rose to 3.3 and transaminitis to 1000s.  900
cc Para on [**2134-5-5**].  Troponin elevated to 17 and echo showed
depressed EF of 15%.  Mental status remained poor. No LP was
done.  CT on admission with ascites.  Given deteriorating liver
and kidney function, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2134-5-7**].

[**Hospital 18**] HOSPITAL COURSE:
# Pulm: The patient remained intubated and on mechanical
ventilation while at [**Hospital1 18**]. During his hospitalization, his
course was complicated by aspiration pneumonia, which was
treated with antibiotics.  He ultimately had a tracheostomy.

# ID: The patient's listeriosis was treated with ampicillin and
bactrim for prolonged course. Infectious disease was consulted
and helped in management of his antibiotics.  MRI showed small
abscesses in his brain and signals consistent with
cerebritis/meningitis.  On [**2134-5-25**], his blood cultures grew out
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**]. All of his lines were cultured and resited.
These line cultures also grew out yeast. He was treated for
fungemia.  TTE was negative for vegetations.  LP was performed
by IR on [**2134-5-31**] thus far with unrevealing results.  He was on
antibiotics for the duration of his hospitalization until CMO
status was decided.

# Renal: Renal assisted in management of his acute renal
failure, which was thought to be due to ATN.  The patient had
temporary HD lines placed for CVVH.  He continued on CVVH while
hospitalized.

# CV: Patient noted to have troponin leak which was likely
demand ischemia in the setting of acute illness rather than a
primary plaque rupture event.  Cardiology was initially
consulted.  The patient's troponins were trended.

# Neuro: During his hospitalization, his neurological status was
complicated by seizures which were likely due to small abscesses
[**1-25**] his infection.  Neurology was consulted and assisted in
management of his anti-epileptic medication.  Additionally, EEGs
were performed which showed moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.

# GI: Liver team consulted due to transamnitis likely in the
setting of sepsis. Trended LFTs daily. Held spirinolactone.

The patient expired on [**2134-6-6**] at 0115 with family at bedside
after having been made comfort measures only.  Primary cause of
death due to sepsis secondary to listeriosis and fungemia.
