Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
pulled out g-tube

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right sided thoracentesis [**12-18**]


History of Present Illness:
83yo M with HTN, COPD, Atrial fibrillation, CABGx4 [**8-17**]
complicated by sternal dehiscence, who is s/p partial transverse
colectomy with primary anastomosis and partial gastrectomy on
[**2171-11-5**] (for feculent peritonitis) who presents with dislodgment
of his G-J tube today.
.
The patient has a long, complicated medical course that begins
in [**8-/2171**] when he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for chest pain. He
was found to have 3VD and underwent 4 vessel CABG. His course
was complicated by sternal wound infection and dehiscence. The
patient was readmitted in [**9-/2171**] with a severe CDiff infection
treated with Vancomycin and Metronidazole.
.
The patient was again readmitted late [**2171-10-9**] for abdominal
distention and pain and was found to have feculent peritonitis.
The patient was treated with antibiotics and was s/p partial
transverse colectomy. His course was also complicated by wound
dehiscence.
.
After speaking to the physician at [**Hospital3 **], the patient
was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for admission because of increasing
agitation in the past several days leading patient to pull his
GJ tube last night. Additionally, the patient was found to have
a positive UA last wednesday, started on Levofloxacin initially,
but transitioned to Imipenem on Monday after Cx grew Klebsiella.

.
The patient's son was also available to speak to and he stated
that his dad has become increasingly agitated over the past
several days. He stated that he also had increasing difficulty
breathing while laying back that was relieved by sitting upright
that has been worsening over the past several days.
.
In the ED, initial vs were 98.5 71 128/57 20 99% Trachmask.
General surgery placed a foley in patient's G tube site
temporarily. He was treated with CTX for his UTI. Pt was stable
on arrival to floor.
.
On the floor, the patient was rather lethargic, but was
intermittantly responsive. He denied any pain. Otherwise was
unable to get a thorough ROS.

CT THORAX:
There is a tracheostomy. No pathologically enlarged mediastinal,
hilar,
internal mammary or axillary adenopathy. There is focal stenosis
identified at the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery with no
filling defects identified.
There is enlargement of the left atrium with associated
cardiomegaly and
three-vessel coronary artery disease. No pericardial effusion.
There is a
loculated right pleural effusion with a maximum thickness along
the
mediastinum of 2.5 cm (series 2, image 17) and also along the
lateral chest wall, maximum thickness 2.2 cm (series 2, image
25). It appears simple -no enhancement to suggest empyema. There
is a small dependent effusion identified within the left lower
lobe. There is atelectasis and consolidation of the right lowe
