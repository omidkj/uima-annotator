Pertinent Results:
[**2181-6-26**] CT Scan Chest
1. Aortic dissection as described above originating just at the
level of the origin of the left subclavian and extending through
the entire descending thoracic aorta, the abdominal aorta, and
both common iliac arteries. The SMA, celiac axis, both renal
arteries, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] all originate from the true lumen with no flap

Aneurysmal dilation of the descending abdominal aorta most
prominent just at the bifurcation with associated thrombus
formation up to 5.8 x 5.5 cm.

2. Cirrhosis of the liver with sequelae of portal hypertension
such as
recanalization of the umbilical vein and gastroepiploic varices.
