CXR ([**2116-5-5**]) - Stable postoperative findings indicative of
CHF. Fluid overload, as suggested in the requisition, may be a
cause of these findings provided other cardiogenic factors are
excluded.

LUE US ([**2116-5-2**]) - No evidence of left upper extremity deep
venous thrombus.  Cephalic vein not visualized.

Pathology ([**2116-4-29**]) -
Rectum and sigmoid colon: Two synchronous colonic
adenocarcinomas.  Thirty-five lymph nodes; no malignancy
identified.




Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO/PAIN: The patient was maintained on PCA/IV Morphine for
pain medication in the immediate post-operative period and
transitioned to PO narcotic medication with adequate pain
control on POD#[**6-19**]. The patient remained neurologically intact
and without change from baseline. The patient remained alert and
oriented to person, location and place.

CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient experienced a  single episode of
what was suspected ventricular tachycardia and his AICD fired a
single time intra-operatively, as previously mentioned. The
event occurred soon after insufflation of the abdomen during
attempted laparoscopy. In light of the rhythm concerns, the
procedure was converted to an open approach. The procedure
progressed without further hemodynamic or arrhythmic issues and
he was transferred to ICU in stable condition, intubated. The
EP/cardiology service was consulted for further management, they
recommended continuing his outpatient anti-arryhthmic [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
(dofetilide) and initiating post-op beta-blockade with IV
metoprolol. Serial EKGs were closely monitored without issue. He
was transitioned to oral Metoprolol, continued his dofetilide,
and started Digoxin with resolve of cardiac issues by POD#4.
Vitals signs were closely monitored via telemetry. Lopressor
increased to provide better appropriate rate control.

RESPIRATORY: The patient was extubated POD# 1 successfully. The
patient had no episodes of desaturation. The patient denied
cough or respiratory symptoms. Pulse oximetry was monitored
closely and the patient maintained adequate oxygenations. serial
CXRs did reveal some evidence of atelectasis versus
consolidation, along with pleural effusions (improved with
diuresis) which was closely monitored. A sputum sample revealed
H. influenzae (non type-B) that was sensitive to Ampicillin.
Given diurnal temperature spikes and the respiratory source of
infection, empiric Vancomycin and Zosyn IV were started on
POD#2.  He completed a course of Zosyn and his respiratory
status was stable.

GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient was NPO following their procedure
and transitioned to sips and a clear liquid diet on POD#[**7-21**]. The
patient experienced no nausea or vomiting. His ostomy site began
functioning with liquid stool output and gas in the appliance on
POD# [**5-19**]. His stoma site appeared dusky and friable with some
edema that progressed post-op, but was cloesly monitored and
deemed clinically stable. The patient was transitioned to a
regular diet on POD#9 and IV fluids were discontinued once
adequate PO intake was established.

GENITOURINARY: The patient's urine output was closely monitored
in the immediate post-operative period. A Foley catheter was
placed intra-operatively and removed on POD#6, at which time the
patient was able to successfully void without issue. The
patient's intake and output was closely monitored for > 30 mL
per hour output. The patient's creatinine was stable, his
baseline being above normal.

HEME: The patient remained hemodynamically stable and only
required transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells. The
patient's coagulation profile remained normal. The patient had
no evidence of bleeding from their incision.

ID: The patient was febrile immediately post-op and displayed a
nearly diurnal fever curve, the source likely being a sputum
sample which revealed H. influenzae (non type-B) that was
sensitive to Ampicillin. Given diurnal temperature spikes and
the respiratory source of infection, empiric Vancomycin and
Zosyn IV were started on POD#2. Their white count was stable
post-operatively and their incision was closely monitored for
any evidence of infection or erythema. Staples were removed from
the superior aspect of the incision on POD#5 given some
spreading peri-incisional erythema, and green-brown purulence
was expressed and cultured. Dry dressing were changed daily
following the staple removal. There was no induration,
fluctuance.  Wound cultures demonstrated pan-sensitive
pseudomonas and he has been on oral ciprofloxacin, which will
continue until [**5-16**].

ENDOCRINE: The patient's blood glucose was closely monitored in
the post-op period with Q6 hour glucose checks. Blood glucose
levels greater than 120 mg/dL were addressed with an insulin
sliding scale.

PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was maintained on heparin 5000 units SQ
TID for DVT/PE prophylaxis and encoura
