Brief Hospital Course:
#Dyspnea / rash:  Patient was admitted with complaint of
shortness of breath and rash.  She was initially treated in the
ICU due to risk of intubation and hx of tracheobronchomalacia.
Patient was treated in the ICU with  albuterol and ipratroprium
nebulizers to help with her shortness of breath.  She was also
given benadryl for rash / airway inflammation, and given
Benzonatate (tesselon)  and guiafenesin for cough.  Over the
course of 24 hours, patient's shortness of breath diminished,
and patient was only complaining of an irritating cough, but was
breathing well on RA.  She continued to have bilateral
expiratory wheezes.  Patient's rash also abated over the course
of her day in the ICU.
.
The patient was transferred to the medicine floor and out of the
ICU once her risk of intubation had decreased.  Here she
continued to be monitored and treated for shortness of breath.
She was maintained on albuterol and ipratroprium nebs as well as
benadryl PRN.  Her SOB and cough improved and her O2 sat
increased to 97% on RA. She will follow up with an allergist to
evaluate for possible allergies that could have caused this
reaction.  An appointment has been made with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (an
allergist she has seen before) on fri [**2199-2-8**] @ 11:15am at
[**Hospital6 **].
Patient will be sent home with an Epi pen to have with her if an
allergic reaction happens in the future.
