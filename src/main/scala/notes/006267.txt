Attending:[**Last Name (un) 2888**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall, weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left PICC Line placement


History of Present Illness:
84F with no known coronary disease but a history of DM/ HTN/ HL,
diastolic heart failure and known mod AS, mild AI and breast CA
who p/w proximal muscle weakness and dysuira. The morning of
[**8-31**], patient went to urinate and had dysuria. She was unable to
stand up from the toliet due to new proximal muscle weakness and
ended up sitting there before rolling off to try to crawl to
reach the telephone which rang intermittantly. She specifically
denies any chest pain, palpitations, loss of consciousness, or
staying flat on one part of her body or the other. At baseline,
she is able to climb a flight of stairs before getting leg
weakness, but no dyspnea/ chest pain. She also denies orthopnea
or PND prior or after the event. Finally, her daughter found her
and brought her to the ED.

In the ED, initial vitals were 20:54 0 100.0 74 111/47 16 99%
4L. Exam remarkable for 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, loudest at
the base and radiated to the upper chest and neck. No pulsus
parvus et tardus, preserved S2. Lungs were CTAB. Labs remarkable
for a creatinine of 1.4, CK: 4062 MB: 21 MBI: 0.5 Trop-T: 0.25,
WBC of 13.2 with 90% neutrophils. UA with large leuks, neg
nitrites and many bacteria. Imaging remarkable for Head CT with
small left parietal subgaleal hematoma. Patient was given 1L NS
as well as 650mg acetaminophen and 500mg PO cipro. VS on
transfer 98.2, 75, 138/66, 96% RA.
Upon arrivival to the floor, patient is rigoring.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
