FOOT AP,LAT & OBL LEFT Study Date of [**2132-2-9**] 10:04 AM

IMPRESSION:
1. Markedly abnormal first toe with extensive subcutaneous
emphysema. No
definite underlying bony abnormality.
2. Focal 6 mm lucency along medial base of first metatarsal
could represent a small focus of osteomyelitis, though is remote
from the area of subcutaneous emphysema and from the clinical
area of concern in the lateral foot.
3. Faint area of relative lucency along the medial aspect of the
medial
cuneiform likely represents artifact.
4. Bones are otherwise within normal limits for age.

ECG Study Date of [**2132-2-12**]  8:58:46 AM
Technically difficult study
Sinus rhythm
Increased QRS voltage
Lateral precordial leads
Suggest repeat tracing
Clinical correlation is suggested
No previous tracing available for comparison

RENAL U.S. Study Date of [**2132-2-12**] 7:03 PM
FINDINGS: No prior comparison imaging available. Right kidney
measures 10.2 cm, left kidney measures 10.3 cm. There is a tiny
crystal in the mid pole of the left kidney. Both kidneys are
otherwise normal in appearance, without evidence of mass, stone,
or hydronephrosis. Bladder is decompressed, with Foley catheter
balloon seen in place.
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.



Brief Hospital Course:
[**2132-2-8**] Patient transferred from OSH for lethargy, fever and
necrotic/gangrenous L foot ulcers. Started ABX
(Vanco/Cipro/Flagyl). Routine labs and nursing care. Arrive w/ a
foley catheter. UA & Cx sent. L foot X-ray showed osteo along
medial base of first metatarsal could represent a small focus of
osteomyelitis.

[**2132-2-9**] No acute events. incontinent of loose stools sent for
C-diff x 3, all came back negative. Foley was d/c'd- voided
within time frame. Continue ABX. Patient made aware of the need
for him to have BKA. Patient refused to consider this as an
option. A greed to have an angiogram w/ the possibility of
revascularization instead.

[**2132-2-10**] Low grade fever. Continue ABX. UA came back w/ bacteria.
Patient already on Cipro will await sensitivity. Continue to
have frequent stools, condom cath applied.
Confused at times.

[**2132-2-11**] No acute events, continues w/ ABX. Incontinent of urine
and stool. Wound care-consulted- recs-barrier cream to affected
areas. Continues w/ ABX. Pre-op for angiogram and possible
intervention on [**2132-2-12**].

1/13-14/09 No acute events overnight. Taken to holding room for
scheduled angiogram, cancelled due to creatine rise to 2.3
compared to admission creatinine of 0.7. Vanco trough also came
back 47.4. Brought back to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5. Foley placed. Agressive IV
hydration started. Repeat creat 2.4->2.7 am [**2-13**], Vanco trough
47.5->36.8 morning of [**2-13**]. Angiogram on hold. Hct down to 24.3,
transfused w/ 2 units packed RBC. Nephrology consulte-recs to
hold angiogram likely AIN- recs, start Prednisone 40 mg qd,
switch PPI to H2 blocker, labs: CBCw/ diff, LDH, SPEP, UPEP, &
urine and creatinine ratio, hold off IV hydration after blood
transfusions.

[**2-14**]-/09 VSS. Creatinine continue to rise now 3.0, with low
urine output, Nephrology following. Had several liquid bowel
movements, already on emperic Flagyl, and previously negative
for C-diff. Sent stool samples for C-diff again.

[**2132-2-15**] VSS. Had Continue to get more confused and becoming
uncoopeartive to care. Transferred to Medicine for further
medical management, will follow re:vascular perspective,
intervention to be revisited once renal/medically stable. To be
followed also by Nephrology.
