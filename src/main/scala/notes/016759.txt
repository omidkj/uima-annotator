.
MRI L spine:
1. Acute-appearing fractures involving the superior endplate of
L3 and the
superior and inferior plate endplates of L4 with retropulsion of
L4 fracture
fragments resulting in severe stenosis of the spinal canal at
this level. No
soft tissue mass is identified; however, a pathologic fracture
in the
appropriate clinical setting cannot be excluded.

2. Disc protrusion at L5-S1 resulting in moderate spinal canal
narrowing at
this level.
.
Bone Scan:
1. No scintigraphic evidence of osseous metastases.
2. Mild tracer uptake in the metaphysis of the distal right
femur, the location
of which could be compatible with a bone infarct or enchondroma
- correlation
could be made with radiographs.
3. Focal linear uptake in the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies is
consistent with
recent fractures as seen on MRI.
.
EEG:
This is an abnormal EEG in the awake and drowsy states due
to the presence of isolated and independent bitemporal
epileptiform
discharges. Note is incidentally made of a slower than average
cardiac
rate.

Brief Hospital Course:
43 yom with history of Asthma, GERD, [**Last Name (un) 865**] Esophagus,
Depression, Seizure disorder, Hodgkin's disease who presented to
the ED with back pain and Nausea and vomiting. EGD showed
multiple ulcers. Pt was hemodynamically stable throught MICU
stay requiring only 1 unit of blood.
.
# UGIB:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with nausea and vomiting with
coffee ground emesis. EGD showed multiple ulcers. IV PPI
converted to omeprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **] + carafate qid.  At the time of
discharge, biopsies were pending. Q4h Hct showed that he
repsonded to transfusion of 1 uPRBC and did not bleed further.
This was felt to be secondary to years of frequent NSAID use.
Biopsies on discharge were pending.
.
# Back Pain:  MRI of the lumbar spine showed fractures of L3 and
L4 with retropulsion of L4 fracture fragments, but no soft
tissue mass.  Bone scan was done that did not show metastatic
disease.  Neurosurgery recommended TSLO brace.  IR was consulted
and patient underwent vetebroplasty [**12-9**].  Biopsy was taken at
that time (pending on discharge).  Patient tolerated this
procedure well.  Patient was pain controlled with morphine,
lidocaine patch, and tylenol.  Patient was instructed to wear
TSLO brace while ambulating at all time.
.
# Seizure:  MRI head did not show any metastatic disease.
Neurology was consulted and EEG was done that showed presence of
isolated and independent bitemporal epileptiform discharges.
Patient was started on seizure ppx with Zonisamide and
discharged w/ follow up with neurology.
.
# Metastatic Germ Cell tumor:  An HCG checked was 19.  Urology
consulted for retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.  This was
deferred to be done once stable as outpatient pending biopsy
results (as stated above) and better seizure control.
