Examination of the heart revealed regular rate and rhythm

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Thoracic
Surgery Service and the patient underwent lobectomy of the
right middle lobe and right lower lobe to remove a central
tumor impinging on the right middle lobe and right lower lobe
bronchus.  The patient did well from the surgery.
Postoperatively the patient was afebrile with stable vital
signs.  The patient's pain was controlled with epidural and
the chest tube was removed on the first day which was done in
error.  The patient was clinically stable but had developed a
hydropneumothorax.  The patient underwent a thoracostomy tube
to replace the chest tube.  The patient underwent that
placement of the chest tube without any difficulties.  The
patient had an epidural for pain.  The patient continued
having the chest tube which had some air leak.  The patient
appears to be out of bed to chair.  The patient's diet was
advanced.

On postoperative day #3, the patient remained afebrile with
stable vital signs.  The patient's pain was continued to be
well controlled and the patient had on x-ray improvement of
the right upper lobe essentially but there was still residual
pneumothorax on the right side.  The patient was continued on
chest tube.  On postoperative day #4 the patient continued to
do well, remained afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient's epidural was removed and the patient was put on
PCA.  Another chest x-ray was obtained which showed improved
expansion of the remaining portion of the right lung
following chest tube placement and moderate size of the
pneumothorax.  On postoperative day #5, the patient continued
to do well and remained afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient continued to have pneumothorax on the chest
x-ray, so the chest tube was still left in place.

The patient had removal of the chest tube on postoperative
day #5 after demonstration of no air leak and a stable x-ray
appearence. The chest tube
was removed subsequently where the patient experienced chest
pain and associated shortness of breath which was resolved.
A follow-up chest x-ray revealed that the patient
had a significantly larger pneumothorax requiring a chest tube
placement.
The patient underwent placement of the chest tube in the
Intensive Care Unit with sedation.  On postoperative day #6,
the patient continued to be afebrile with stable vital signs.
Chest x-ray revealed the patient continued to
hydropneumothorax.  The patient was continued on a chest
tube.

On postoperative day #7, the patient remained afebrile with
stable vital signs.  The patient's chest tube was clamped and
chest x-ray was obtained.  Chest x-ray revealed stable
hydropneumothorax.  The chest tube was removed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**],
