Allergies:
Avapro / Zetia / Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8487**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
64 yo male with PMH CAD (s/p CABG), AF (on coumadin), DM, HTN,
recent admission for presumed drug-induced
rhabdomyolysis/weakness resulting in hypercarbic respiratory
failure (s/p trach and PEG) and ARF presents with hypercarbic
respiratory failure.
.
Pt was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 60244**] with elevated
LFTs, rhabdomyolysis with CK 13,000 and weakness presumed
secondary to a combination of zetia and avapro. Muscle biopsy
suggested a metabolic myopathy induced by toxic agents and drugs
(i.e cholesterol lowering agents). No evidence of inflammatory
myositis. Medications were held.
Hepatitis serologies negative. Pt developed hypercarbic
respiratory failure secondary to muscle weakness and was
intubated, then got trach and PEG for failure to extubate in
setting of persistently low NIFs. Course was complicated by
contrast nephropathy and was temporarily on HD; creatinine on
discharge was 1.0.
.
Recently, pt was being weaned off the vent: Trach was capped
during the day and put on Bipap at night. Per wife, pt was
having difficulty tolerating Bipap. PEG removed one week ago; pt
is eating by mouth. Per the pt's wife, pt expressed generalized
malaise for the past 3 days. On the morning of admission, pt was
noted to be less responsive and A&O x 1 (at baseline A&O x 3 and
appropriate). ABG was 7.15/117/65. Pt was given Lasix 200 IV x1,
put on mechanical ventilation, and transferred for further mgmt.
.
Of note, per wife, pt was coded two weeks ago. [**Month (only) 116**] have
preceding hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was pulseless and
received CPR without any shocks. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital 8**]
Hospital for one day. No neurologic complications.
.
ROS: [**Name (NI) 1094**] wife denies recent fever, GU sx. Pt has had some
secretion from trach. + nausea, abominal discomfort,
constipation. Denies vomiting, hematachezia, BRBPR, hematemesis.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was continued on AC 600/16/5/.4. ABG was
7.29/66/414.

Imaging:
CXR: [**2133-10-27**]: INDICATION: 64-year-old male status post NG tube
placement.

COMPARISON: Comparison is made to radiograph performed in the
same day, approximately one hour earlier.

FINDINGS: There is interval placement of the NG tube with the
tip lying within the stomach. Otherwise, the appearance of the
chest is unchanged.
.
[**2133-10-27**]: EKG: AF @72, nl axis, nl QTc, low voltages, diffuse
TWF, 1mm STD in V2-4 (new)
.
[**2133-10-27**]: TTE ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
hypokinesis of the basal half of the right ventricular free wall
preserved apical systolic function. There is abnormal systolic
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-8-28**], the
findings are similar. The prominent RV cavity enlargement and
free wall hypokinesis are similar and underestimated on the
prior study and suggestive of a primary pulmonary process
(pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, bronchospasm, etc.). The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is similar.
.



Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 64 yo male with recent drug induced
rhabdomyolosis/hepatitis complicated by respiratory failure (s/p
Trach/PEG) and ARF who is re-admitted with hypercarbic
respiratory failure.
