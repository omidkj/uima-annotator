COVERING RESIDENT:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 99294**], MD.  Pager #:  [**Numeric Identifier 99295**].

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old man
with severe coronary artery disease, AICD, hypertension, and
a history of alcoholism, who presents unresponsive with a
head laceration.  On [**2193-7-4**], the patient was found at
home by his wife in bed, bleeding from the scalp after having
crawled after a fall.  He was able to ambulate at that time,
but soon after, he was found unresponsive in a pool of blood.
He remembers only walking from the living room to the
bedroom, then blacking out.  He reports having had a single
drink of vodka with cranberry juice that day.  The EMS was
called and the patient was found hypotensive, intubated in
field and brought to the ED still unresponsive.  In the ED,
Mr. [**Known lastname **] received packed red blood cells and 4.5 liter
normal saline for resuscitation.  He received a total of 8
units of packed red blood cells and two units of fresh frozen
plasma for the ICU stay.  He also received Cefazolin one gram
IV and methylprednisolone IV.  CT scan of the head showed no
hemorrhage or fracture, only significant right-sided soft
tissue swelling.  CT scan of the spine showed only stable old
C2 fracture and slight anterior C4-C5 listhesis, for which
she was put in a collar.  The right facial avulsion was
sutured and stapled.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the
Trauma Surgery ICU, where he continued to receive fluids and
he was started on  Dopamine.  The ethanol level was measured
at 247.  He was started on Ativan for alcohol withdrawal.
AICD was interrogated by the on call electrophysiology fellow
and showed no events.  The fall was presumed to be secondary
to alcohol intoxication.  Dopamine was weaned off and the
patient was transiently given an IV nitroglycerin drip for
hypertension and fluid overload, as well as Furosemide IV.
His course was also complicated by metabolic acidosis, mixed
anion gap and nonanion gap, which was resolving on transfer
to the [**Hospital **] Medical Team.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
PROBLEM #1:    Coronary artery disease status post CABG in
[**2190**] (LIMA LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-PDA.  Coronary catheterization on
[**7-8**], [**2193**], after loss of consciousness showed
three-vessel CAD (LM 50-60, LAD T.O., LIMA-LAD patent with
50% to 60% stenosis and retrograde LAD, LCX 70-80, proximal
OM1 high grade times two, OM2 70-8, SVG-OM2 patent, RCA T.O.
SVG-PDA 60%).  Stents to the left main coronary artery and
ramus intermedius placed at [**Hospital1 756**] [**Hospital5 **] [**Hospital6 44770**] Hospital on
[**2193-6-19**].

PROBLEM #2:  Left ventricular dysfunction.  Transthoracic
echocardiogram on [**2193-6-17**] after loss of consciousness showed
LV ejection fraction 25%, septal and apical wall motion
abnormalities, moderate MR, tricuspid valve gradient of 37
indicating moderate pulmonary hypertension.

PROBLEM #3:  Ventricular arrhythmia with automatic internal
cardiac defibrillator placed.  Defibrillator by EMS in the
field on 7/[**2192**].  Details unavailable, but the patient was
started on Amiodarone at that time.  On [**2193-6-16**], the
patient was admitted to [**Hospital 21811**] [**Hospital6 **] after
loss of consciousness.  No arrhythmia was documented, but EKG
showed on incomplete right bundle branch block.  CT angiogram
did not reveal pulmonary embolism.  Transthoracic
echocardiogram and catheterization as above.  AICD placed on
[**2193-6-21**].

PROBLEM #4:  Aspiration pneumonia diagnosed on
hospitalization earlier this month, treated with Levofloxacin
and Clindamycin for ten days.

PROBLEM #5:  Peripheral vascular disease with right femoral
tibial bypass on [**2193-6-12**], complicated at that time by wound
infection requiring prolonged hospitalization.

PROBLEM #6:  Bilateral carotid artery disease.

PROBLEM #7:  Ethanol abuse with past withdrawal episodes.

PROBLEM #8:  Positive PPD in [**2190**] with no related
abnormalities on chest x-ray at that time.

PROBLEM #9:  Hypertension.

PROBLEM #10:  Peptic ulcer disease.

PROBLEM #11:  C1, C2 spinal fusion.
