Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. No atheroma in
ascending aorta. No atheroma in aortic arch. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Critical AS (area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed mitral valve leaflets.
Severe mitral annular calcification. Severe valvular MS (MVA
<1.0cm2). Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the procedure. No TEE related complications. Results
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe mitral annular calcification. There is severe valvular
mitral stenosis (area <1.0cm2). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen.

The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

There is no pericardial effusion.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the
operating room.

POSTBYPASS:
The patient is AV paced on phenylephrine infusion. Biventricular
function is maintained. There is a well seated bioprosthesis in
the aortic position. Due to suboptimal image quality, leaflet
excursion is difficult to assess. Peak & mean gradients across
the prosthesis are 10 & 5mmHg, although this assessment was
challenging due to suboptimal image quality. There is no AI.
The mitral stenosis is mildly improved, MVA 158cm2 by P1/2.
There is slightly improved mobility of the anterior mitral
leaflet. The MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1506**]. The remaining valves are
[**Last Name (Titles) 1506**].
The aorta remains intact.
