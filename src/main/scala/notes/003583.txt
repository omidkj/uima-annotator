History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 74741**] is a 59 year old female with medical history
significant for esophageal CA diagnosed in [**2167-4-14**] who now
presents with acute dyspnea and large bloody BM. The patient was
initially seen at OSH with Hct of 17 on presentation and SBP in
the 80s. The patient was resuscitated with 2U PRBCs and 2.5L NS
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ongoing management. On arrival to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED the patient was with repeat Hct of 24 with SBP of
130 but still tachycardic. The patient was given a 3rd unit of
blood on arrival. GI and surgery have been contact[**Name (NI) **]. GI will
see patient in the MICU. The patient additionally had a CTA of
the chest performed given concern that the patient's
mediastinal/esophageal mass may have resulted in aortic
fistulization, this was ruled out by CTA. An NG lavagae has not
been performed given concern for Esophageal CA.
.
Patient denies any use of NSAIDS, aspirin, or alcohol. She has
been receiving chemotherapy and radiation starting this month
for the tumor. She has also been receiving dexamethasone as part

/GJ TUBE CHECK PORT  [**2167-8-18**] 10:06 AM

G/GJ TUBE CHECK PORT

Reason: Please check placement
Contrast: CONRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old woman with esophageal cancer
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please check placement
INDICATION: Esophageal cancer. Check tube placement.

COMPARISON: AXR [**2167-8-17**].

FINDINGS: Initial scout radiograph demonstrates previously
administered contrast in loops of small and large bowel. After
instillation of Gastrografin through the J-tube, there is
opacification of a loop of small bowel. No extraluminal contrast
is identified.

IMPRESSION: Satisfactory positioning of J-tube.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-

Reason: eval for bleed
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old woman with esophageal CA, 5cm mass in upper thorax,
with GIB from OSH, BP 60s initially, now 130s on 2nd liter of
PRBC.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 59-year-old female with esophageal cancer, also with GI
bleeding and initially hypotensive with concern for erosion into
the great vessels of the mediastinum.

COMPARISON: No prior study at this institution.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the thorax pre- and post- rapid
bolus of 100 ml Optiray IV contrast per the CT angiogram
protocol with coronal and sagittal reformats.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is irregular
wall thickening of the mid thoracic esophagus concerning for
tumor, which involves an approximately 6 cm long segment. While
the portion of the esophagus that is involved with the mass
closely abuts the aorta and trachea, there is no evidence of
invasion of these structures. The heart and great vessels of the
chest opacify well. There is no evidence of central pulmonary
embolism. There is no pathologic mediastinal lymphadenopathy
identified.

There is scarring at the lung apices. There are mild background
centrilobular emphysematous changes. There is a tiny calcified
granuloma of the right middle lobe measuring 3 mm. There is no
pleural or pericardial effusion and no pneumothorax. Limited
evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates no significant
abnormality.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions
are identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Irregular wall thickening involving a 6 cm long segment of
mid thoracic esophagus concerning for esophageal neoplasm. While
the involved segment of the esophagus abuts the aorta, there is
no evidence of erosion into the aorta.
2. Emphysema


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was treated for her GI bleed which was thought to be
secondary to XRT, chemotherapy, or dexamethasone therapy for her
esophageal mass.   Pt was seen by GI who felt that the mass was
too friable and given her recent endoscopy at the OSH where they
couldn't pass the scope past the mass, another endoscopy wasn't
warrented at the time. Surgery was consulted but felt the pt did
not have a need for surgical intervention.  Pt monitored with
serial Hcts, large bore IVs were placed, and started on
Pantoprazole 40mg IV BID.  While pt was in house, she also had
her J-tube re-evulated twice for concerns of positioning. Both
gastrofin studies showed good positioning.
Pt was monitored for 48 hours, was stable throughout entire
course, and discharged home on a PPI.
