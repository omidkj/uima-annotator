Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization - [**2179-3-22**]

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] F with history of HTN, dCHF, severe AS, HLD who presented
initially to [**Location (un) 620**] from PCP office with complaint of chest
pressure anteriorly. She described it as substernal, constant
since last night. She felt exhausted and lightheaded and also
had some diarrhea last night. Also noticed some numbness in her
right leg whihc comes and goes. Was found to have EKG changes at
the PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3726**].  She had no prior cardiac history.  Had been
seen last week at OSH ED and ruled out with -ve sets after
"strained muscle in her chest moving her arm". A CTA of the
chest showed mild emphysema, but no evidence of PE.
.
In [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] ED, initial VS were 97.8, HR 109, BP 121/84, RR
22, 02 sat 78% and pain 0/10. In ED she was noted to have an o2
sat of 80% and was lightheaded. Found to be guaiac positive. She
got ASA and was started on a heaprin gtt (w/o bolus).
Transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] for STEMI.  IN cath lab,  they went in
through the lt radial huge and found a thrombus in lcx, mild
right disease. She got 600 plavix after cath, bival, bms in lcx,
and had a hematoma in lt radial. Transferred to CCU after
procedure.

Pertinent Results:

Cardiac Cath ([**2179-3-22**])
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated one vessel disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent disease. The LAD had a 30-40% mid vessel stenosis. The
Cx had a
100% mid vessel thrombotic occlusion. The RCA had a 30-40% mid
vessel
stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a central aortic
pressure of
132.86 mmHg.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid Cx with a 2.25x8mm
INTEGRITY
stent which was postdilated to 2.75mm. Final angiography
revealed no
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and
TIMI II
to III flow (see PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid Cx woth a BMS.

Bedside TTE ([**2179-3-22**])
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 15X %). with depressed free wall contractility. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

CXR ([**2179-3-22**])
Wide spread bilateral dense reticular opacities with relative
left lower lung and right mid lung sparing, likely representing
flash pulmonary edema due to acute cardiac decompensation in the
setting of ischemia/infarct.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] F with history of HTN, dCHF, severe AS, HLD who presented
from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with chest pain due to STEMI
.
#. STEMI/CAD - EKG at [**Location (un) 620**] concerning for STEMI, transferred
here for cardiac cath.  Pt went straight to cath lab, was found
have an occluded LCX, and had a BMS deployed with good
restoration of flow.  She had no previous history of coronary
artery disease and a recent echo did not show any evidence of
wall motion abnormality or significant valvular disease.
Arrived to CCU for further observation following procedure.  She
shortly thereafter developed worsening oxygen requirement.  Stat
CXR was performed which showed significant bilateral pulmonary
edema, likely flash pulmonary edema from acute cardiac
decompensation.  Patient had initially said that she did not
want to be intubated, but wanted to have cardiac resuscitation.
Upon seeing CXR results, her son/HCP was immediately called to
discuss new findings and what this might represent.  In light of
the fact that she had just undergone cardiac cath, the thought
that what was going on was likely [**2-4**] her STEMI and potentially
reversible if we pursued intubation and aggressive diuresis.
Code status was reversed from DNI to full code.  As patient's
respiratory status worsened, she became more bradycardic and
more hypotensive.  Anesthesia was called for elective
intubation, however patient quickly became hemodynamically
stable.  Dopamine, then levophed were started peripherally as
patient did not have central access.  Stat bedside TTE was
performed to evaluate valves as she just had STEMI.  Mitral
valve was widely regurgitant, which is acutely changed from the
TTE she had at [**Location (un) 620**] a few weeks ago.  Patient continued to
become more bradycardic, transcutaneous pacing was started.
Hemodynamics and respiratory status worsened.  Code blue was
called.  On holding transcutaneous pacing, patient was shown to
be in PEA arrest.  Patient was coded with CPR, a total of 5
rounds of epinephrine, 3 rounds of atropine, 2 rounds of bicarb,
1 round of vasopressin.  CCU and interventional attending was
called, decision was made not to bring patient back to the cath
lab.  Pulse could not be recovered at any point during the code.
 After 14 minutes, decision was made to stop code.  Time of
death was 9:04 PM on [**2179-3-22**].  Family was present and updated
by the CCU team, they declined autopsy.  Medical examiner waived
autopsy as well.
