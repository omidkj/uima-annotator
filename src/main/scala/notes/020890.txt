Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71M who was initially referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
following a thoracotomy demonstrating RUL adenocarcinoma
invading
the chest wall, followed by 3 months of carboplatin and Taxol
with Avastin.  He underwent a second thoracotomy with RUL
lobectomy and en bloc R chest wall resection (ribs [**3-9**]) with
[**Doctor Last Name 4726**]
Tex chest wall reconstruction and decortication of the RML and
RLL with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2100-12-21**].  His postoperative course was
complicated by a bronchopleural fistula and Serratia VAP for
which he took cipro x 14 days.  On [**2101-1-13**], he was re-admitted
with R empyema and partial dehiscence of the chest wall patch.
On [**1-18**], he underwent R VATS with drainage, decortication, and
removal of patch.  Postoperatively, his three chest tubes were
converted to empyema tubes.  He was discharged on vancomycin and
fluconazole on [**2101-2-11**].  Since discharge, he has returned twice
for desaturations.  Both times, his vitals were stable and his
CXR unchanged; he was thus sent home with regular follow up in
clinic.  On [**2101-2-23**], he began c/o SOB.  In transit to [**Hospital1 18**], EMS
noted HR 30 and apneic.  He was intubated at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital
then transferred directly to the TSICU.  Thick purulent
secretions were noted.  He then underwent bronchoscopy which
demonstrated thin secretions in the trachea and proximal b/l
bronchi.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro: patient was kept under light sedation for comfort while
intubated with propofol.  His pain was initially controlled with
prn fentanyl.  Eventually his propofol was weaned and he was
switched to a regimen of prn morphine and ativan.  He was then
switched to PO roxicet and ativan down his PEG tube after this
was placed.  We attempted to keep his sedation minimal and only
adminstered when he was agitated or requiring sedation for a
procedure.

During the hospitalization, delirium was persistent. Psychiatry
and geriatrics consultations were obtained. Treatment w/
multiple agents, including haldol, Remeron, and Zyprexa were
tried. On [**2101-4-28**], head CT was obtained, showing marked
predominantly vasogenic edema spread diffusely within both
cerebral hemispheres, right cerebellum, and possibly within the
brainstem with at least two focal hyperdense lesions noted
within the left periventricular white matter and left basal
ganglia. These findings were consistent with widespread
metastatic disease.

CV: An Echo was done at admission which demonstrated normal
systolic function.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without
evidence of ischemic.  He was continued on beta blockade.  He
was given prn doses of hydralazine and diltiazem for HTN or
tachcardia.  During the last week of his hospitalization,
intermittent bradycardia was documented while changing his
anti-hypertensive regimen. Electrophysiology consult was
obtained, and bradycardia was thought to be due to excess beta
blockade.

Pulm: He was maintained on the vent initially with
assist-control.  He underwent bronchoscopy on [**2101-2-24**].  He was
found to have secretions in the trachea and b/l main stem
bronchi, BAL was performed.  He decompensated later that day and
there was a question of plugging vs. atelectasis.  A CT chest
was done which showed a moderate left pleural effusion.  A left
sided pigtail catheter was placed by IP for this effusion.  This
tube continued to put out a decent amount of fluid, averaging
about 1000cc per day.  He was rebronched on [**2101-2-26**] for RLL
colapse and found to have a mucus plug and moderate to thick
secretions in the RML and RLL bronchi.  His BAL grew out
Serratia that was pansensitive.  On [**2101-3-1**] extubation was
attempted, but the patient failed and had to be reintubated.
The patient was taken to the OR for an open tracheostomy on
[**2101-3-4**].  8 French portex cath was placed without complications.
 The rest of his pulmonary course included multiple
bronchoscopies for removal of mucous plugs.  He was always
attempted on trach collar on the days when it was deemed he
could tolerate it.  Initially, he was only able to achieve [**3-8**]
hours of trach collar before tiring. Currently, he can [**Last Name (un) 1815**] up
to 12 hrs unless he has accumulated secretions requiring serial
bronchoscopy for pul tiolet.  It was decided he would need vent
rehab after discharge.  His left pigtail was removed after
resolutionneeded to be changed to a pleur-ex and this was done
by IP prior to d/c.  His empyema tubes cont to be backed out
until they were completely out.  The middle tube fell out
spontaneously prior to D/C.

Throughout his admission, patient had heavy secretions,
requiring frequent tracheal suctioning and chest PT, as well as
intermittent bronchoscopy. Pt was transferred to floor [**4-7**]. Pt
required brief transfer to ICU for hypoxia due to mucus plugging
[**4-16**] but transferred back to floor the following day. To help
patient clear the mucus, tracheostomy was downsized to #6
fenestrated uncuffed.

GI: he was kept NPO for the entire hospital course.  Maintained
on GI prophylaxis with PPI.

FEN: He was started on TFs at admission.  His nutritional status
was not improving all that well, and it was decided it would be
a long time before he would be able to take anything PO,
therefore a PEG was placed at the time of trach.  His PEG feeds
were advanced to goal where he remained for his hospital course.
 Nutrition labs were obtained weekly.

Renal: Pt was found to be in prerenal azotemia and acute tubular
necrosis, peaking at Cr 4.6. Nephrology was consulted and CVVH
was initiated. Later, pt tolerated HD. Pt regained renal
function and last HD was [**2101-4-20**].

ID: Patient was found to have pneumonia, BAL growing out
Serratia marcesc
