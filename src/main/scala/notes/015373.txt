Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
fever/chills, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
79M with AF (on coumadin), diastolic CHF, CRI (Cr baseline
1.4-1.6), h/o breast cancer, recently admitted for CHF
exacerbation, presents with fever/chills this afternoon. He also
suffered from a mechanical fall in bathroom, but did not hit his
head and also denies any LOC. No syncope either. He reportedly
only slipped on a film of water. However, he could not get up
and EMS was called. His heart rate was found to be the 170s. He
received 8mg of cardizem IV and HR decreased to 80s, but also
SPBs to 80s. Pt received 250cc IVF bolus with SPB coming up to
120s.
.
In the ED, his VS were T103.8, HR 105, BP 130/28, RR 37 (down to
21 on NRB), O2 sats 83% on RA, requiring a NRB to keep sats in
high 90s. His diastolic BP remained in the 20s and he received
another 300ml IVF bolus. In addition, a R IJ was placed as part
of code sepsis. Lactate was 2.7 but immediate repeat lactate was
only 1.5. UA was positive. Cr at baseline. WBC was 9.2 from
baseline of 6 (with 92% neutrophils). EKG with AF at 99. CXR
with volume overload. BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 961**]. He received on dose of
tylenol 650mg PR and vanco/levo/flagyl IV and was admitted for
suspected sepsis.
.
On arrival in the ICU, he was in NAD with BP 90s/40s, satting
well on NRB which could rapidly been weaned to NC.
.
On ROS, he denied any chest pain, SOB, palpitations, pain
anywhere, current F/C. Also no dysuria but urinary frequency. No
new cough or sputum production (but mild, chronic dry cough). No
increased salt intake or changes in his medications since his
recent discharge. 3 lbs weight gain since recent discharge. Was
advised to take extra dose of 20mg Torsemide per his cardiac RN
this afternoon. In addition, ROS positive as above.

Imaging:
RENAL U.S. PORT  [**2112-11-30**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No stones or hydronephrosis.
2. Innumerable bilateral renal cysts.
3. Large right-sided pleural effusion and small amount of
intra-abdominal ascites.
.
PROSTATE U.S.  [**2112-11-30**]
CONCLUSION: Prostatomegaly with particular enlargement of the
central gland. No evidence of prostatic abscess.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2112-12-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left and
cardiomegaly.
2. Multiple bilateral renal cysts, which are incompletely
evaluated on this non-contrast study. No evidence of renal or
ureteral calculi or hydronephrosis.
3. Extensive calcification of the descending aorta and its
branches.
4. Small-to-moderate amount of free fluid within the abdomen and
pelvis and generalized anasarca.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2112-12-1**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is a small vegetation on the
aortic valve (right cusp). There is a minimally increased
gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened and somewhat shaggy in appearance suggestive of
mitral valve vegetations. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Impression: aortic and mitral valve vegetations
Compared to the previous study of [**2112-4-5**], increased
valvular regurgitation and probable vegetatioons are seen.
 .
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2112-12-5**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Tip of left PICC in lower right atrium, at least 6 cm from
the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
2. Enlarged cardiac silhouette with a globular shape, suggestive
of pericardial effusion in addition to cardiomegaly.
3. Larger moderate right pleural effusion.
4. Fluid overload.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 79M who p/w urosepsis [**1-29**] pan-sensitive E. Coli, found to
have aortic and mitral valve vegetations.
.
# Septic shock:  Source is E. coli UTI [**1-29**] prostatomegaly. Pt
grew pan-sensitive E. coli in UCx and [**12-31**] BCxs upon admission.
Pelvic CT negative for prostatic/renal abcess.  Surveillance
bcxs were neg. from [**2112-11-28**] on.  Pt was initially started on
levofloxacin.  However, vegetations were noted on ECHO that were
concerning for endocarditis although E. coli is not a common
microorganism associated with endocarditis.  Infectious Diseases
service was consulted and recommended ceftriaxone x 4 weeks.  He
will follow up with repeat ECHO after completion of antibiotics
and with Infectious Diseases.
.
# Urinary tract infection:  as above.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure:  BNP in
ED was [**Numeric Identifier 26648**], unchanged from last admission).  Pt did receive
IVF boluses on the field and in the ED.  The patient's home dose
of digoxin was continued, and he was placed on a low-salt diet.
His diuretics (torsemide) and anti-hypertensives were initially
held for hypotension.  However, he had went into flash pulmonary
edema after his episode of RVR, and on the first full hospital
day he required gentle diuresis and initiation of his beta
blocker for rapid ventricular rates.  His anti-hypertensive were
uptitrated slowly to torsemide 40 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg
[**Hospital1 **], and Losartan 25 mg daily, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**].  He was
titrated off O2 by discharge.  He will follow up with the
