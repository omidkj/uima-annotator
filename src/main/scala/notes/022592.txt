Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
83yo female with h/o a fib on coumadin, HTN, and
hypercholesterolemia who presents now s/p fall with acute onset
of SOB. Patient fell unwitnessed at home and was unable to get
up. Unclear how long patient was down, but it was likely [**11-21**]
hours. No LOC or trauma; patient reports she slipped while using
her walker. EMS called, when arrived patient was unsteady on
feet and reported new SOB. Denied any CP, nausea/vomiting,
abdominal pain or lightheadedness at time. Patient denies having
any SOB or dyspnea on exertion prior to the fall, and had been
able to climb one flight of stairs in her home without
significant difficulty up to the day of her fall. In general,
she is not very physically active, and ambulates around her home
with a walker. She denies any prior known history of MI or CHF.
She had 2 attempted cardioversions in the past for her a fib,
which per her report were unsuccessful. The patient states she
does tend to have bilateral lower extremity swelling, but that
the swelling is currently more prominent than usual.
.
She denies any recent illnesses, fever, chills, weight gain or
weight loss, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dysuria, bleeding,
myalgias, or rashes. She does note a one day history of
diarrhea, which resolved at least several days ago, and
arthritic pain in her knees. She did not report any known
history of DVT, PE, stroke, diabetes, thyroid disease, or GERD.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, or syncope. Positive for ankle edema as above.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.2 112 138/89 32 100% on
non-rebreather mask (O2 sat initially 91% on RA). A CXR revealed
mild volume overload and a left lower lobe small opacity, which
could reflect a combination of atelectasis and effusion, with
possible superimposed pneumonia. A CTA chest with and without
contrast was obtained; prelim report found no evidence of PE or
acute aortic pathology, but did note findings suggestive of
infection, predominantly RLL superior segment. A non-contrast CT
head was also obtained, and the preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] suggested no
acute intracranial process s/p fall. Patient received Lasix 20mg
IV once, with initial urine output of 400mL. She received ASA
325mg, morphine 2mg IV, and was started on a nitro gtt. She also
received metoprolol 5mg IV for her a fib with RVR. Given
suspicion for PNA, patient received a dose of vancomycin and
zosyn. An EKG revealed a fib; Q waves in II, III, aVF, V3-V6;
diffuse ST/TW changes most pronounced inferiorly with concave ST
segments but no clear contiguous ST elevations or reciprocal
changes (per cardiology fellow). Cardiac enzymes were sent, and
initial values were CK 2122, MB 43, Trop 0.36. BNP was 5125.
.
On arrival to CCU, patient was tachypnic to the 30s, with O2
sats measuring 98-99% on non-rebreather. She was hypotensive BP
70s/40s, with HR in the 80s-90s. Nitro gtt stopped, and
additional Lasix and beta blockade held. Patient continued to
c/o SOB, but did not develop CP, nausea, palpitations, or
lightheadedness.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**6-2**]
Reason: Please evaluate for ICH


[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   83 year old woman with s/p fall, on coumadin
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   Please evaluate for ICH
CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.

Final Report
INDICATION: Fall.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT. There is minimal motion-related
distortion
at the inferior aspect of the brain, subsequently improved on
repeat
acquisition. Multiplanar reformations were generated.

FINDINGS: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, masses,
mass effect,
or shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles and
sulci are
moderately prominent, suggestive of age-appropriate involutional
changes.
There is minimal periventricular white matter hypoattenuation,
suggesting
chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Bilateral basal ganglia
calcifications
are present. A mucus retention cyst is seen in the left sphenoid
and
maxillary sinuses. There is also mild mucosal thickening in the
right
sphenoid sinus.

A soft tissue scalp hematoma is seen overlying the right
parieto-occipital
scalp.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.

Wet Read: PXDb WED [**2179-6-2**] 6:46 PM
no PE or acute aortic syndromes
Findings suggestive of infection, predominantly RLL superior

CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: No
mediastinal
hemorrhage, intramural hematoma or displaced intimal
calcification on the
non-contrast images. There are numerous subcentimeter
mediastinal nodes that
are not enlarged by CT criteria. Coronary artery calcifications
and mild
mitral annular calcifications are present. There are also
atherosclerotic
aortic calcifications. Biatrial enlargement is present with
particularly
prominent left atrial enlargement.
