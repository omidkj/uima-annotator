Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2185-12-28**] - Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration.
[**2185-12-28**] - Bronchoscopy with insertion of Y stent, trach change


History of Present Illness:
89F with ESRD on hemodialysis, chronically on home ventilatory,
and with history of tracheomalacia, admitted to OSh with vent
dissynchrony, thick secretions, and increasing peak pressures.
At OSH she was found to have Pseudomonas in sputum and started
on Aztreonam.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 295**] trach was inserted by Interventional
Pulmonology at [**Hospital1 18**] to bypass the area of tracheomalacia and
the patient was returned to OSH.  She now returns from the OSH
with hypoxia and hypotension requiring pressors.

***** [**2185-12-28**] XRAY CHEST:
INDICATION: Reevaluate trach and question pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: [**2185-12-17**].

There is no pneumothorax. The tracheostomy tube is 4.9 cm from
the carina. There is a right IJ line that follows the course of
the double-lumen right subclavian catheter projecting 1 cm below
the carina. The left subclavian line appears to have coiled back
within the subclavian vein. The lung parenchyma is difficult to
evaluate due to bilateral overlying effusions which appear worse
particularly on the left, with likely underlying atelectasis.

IMPRESSION: Left subclavian line with tip coiled. Other lines
and tubes in standard position. Worsening effusion particularly
on the left, which is obscuring the lung fields. No
pneumothorax. Findings discussed with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 780**], M.D. at the
time of dictation.

***** [**2185-12-29**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. There is moderate bioprosthetic aortic valve
stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.; the mitral regurgitation may be
severe; if clinically indicated, a transesophageal
echocardiogram would more accurately quantitate the mitral
regurgitation] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 4318**] was admitted to the Trauma ICU on [**2185-12-28**].  She was
restarted on levophed for hypotension for a brief period of
time, and her antibiotics were changed to
Vancomycin/Meropenem/Gentamicin for broader spectrum coverage.
Her central line was remove and cultured, and a new left
subclavian line was placed.  That evening she underwent flexible
bronchoscopy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], which revealed severe tracheomalacia
obstructing her tracheostomy tube, so she was taken to the OR
for insertion of a Y stent across the area of tracheomalacia,
and her tracheostomy was replaced as well.  She subsequently
returned to the ICU in stable condition, was weaned off
pressors, and restarted on her tube feeds.  She passed a bedside
swallow evaluation on [**2185-12-29**] and was started on a clear liquid
diet.  On [**2185-12-30**] her PEG tube was replaced as the old one was
leaking, and she was hemodialyzed.  Since she was afebrile and
her culture data was negative, all antibiotics were stopped.  As
she was saturating well on 15L trach mask, was hemodynamically
stable, and was tolerating tube feeds and PO diet, the decision
was made to discharge the patient to a rehab facility.
