History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 36 year-old male with a history of AML (monocytic
differentiation (trisomy 15) diagnosed in [**4-27**] s/p induction
therapy and 4 cycles of consolidation with high dose cytarabine
presenting after syncopal event and referred from OSH for low
platelets. Pt states he has been having T to [**Age over 90 **]F over the last
2d and this am felt lightheaded, temp 103 and syncopized after
leaving the bathroom. Denies any prodromal symptoms and regained
consciousness before even hitting ground w/o loss of
bowel/bladder incontinence.  Fell down hitting his Left
forehead. Of note, he was discharged [**8-29**] and has been seen
frequently in clinic. He has been neutropenic since [**2101-9-2**].
Presented to OSH and had a CT which per report did not show a
bleed or fx. His plt count was 18,000 and he was transfered here
for transfussion and further work-up. CXR there neg. He was
given 2g cefepime. He denies any n/v, cough, nasal [**Month/Day/Year **],
dysuria, HA, SOB, abd pain. Endorses 2-3 episodes per day  x 3
days of loose stools nonbloody over that last week in context of
taking milk of magnesia for constipation as well as
Ciprofloxacin (started ~[**2101-9-2**]) per primary Oncologist for
prophylaxis. He also endorses sore throat today. At OSH he had
cultures and was transferred here for a plt count of 18. He says
he has been feeling "off" for the past 2 days. Has had some
loose stools, some sore throat.
.
ROS relevent for for right retro-orbital headache. Denies blurry
vision, dizziness, difficulty with speech, focal weakness.
Reports developing a sore throat on ride here. No cough,
shortness of breath, or chest pain. He has had diarrhea for past
2-3 days, 3 episodes of watery, nonbloody stool this AM. Has not
had dysuria, hematuria.  Reports abdominal bloating, nausea
today. No vomiting. No stiff neck, joint pains, leg swelling,
rashes. Has had mild self-limited nosebleeds, no other sites of
bleeding.
.
ED Course: Febrile in the ED to 104, received Tyenol x 2. Was
tachycardic to 140's, given 7 L IVF, and HR came down to 125.
MAPs still less than 65, so CVL was placed. Satting 100% 3L but
tachypneic to high 20s. Bld Cx sent. WBC count is 0.2 with 7%
neutrophils. BMT saw him in the ED, and thought potential for C.
Diff infection. IV Vanc and flagyl added. He also got 2U of
plts, and had a non-con head CT and ABD CT. Head CT: no acute IC
pathology, ? mild max sinus thickening. Abdomen: IMPRESSION:  1.
Findings suggest acute appendicitis with new peri-appendiceal
fat-stranding about a dilated appendix.
2. No CT evidence of colitis. Liquid stool in the colon.

PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- [**2101-4-22**]: admitted after presenting to PCP/[**Hospital **] hospital c/o
malaise, fatigue, syncope, night sweats and weight loss and
