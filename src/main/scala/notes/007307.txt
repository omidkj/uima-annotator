Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8747**]
Chief Complaint:
Subarachnoid hemorrhage


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is [**Age over 90 **] year old man with past medical history of
hypertension, remote smoking, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED as a
transfer from [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation of subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

Per his daughter, he was in usual state of health earlier today.
He dozed off in a chair after lunch, which is not unusual for
him. Then, around 3pm, he woke up and told daughter that he was
going outside to take a walk and rake leaves. She heard him
raking and thought he was doing just fine. Then, around 5pm, a
[**Hospital3 63094**] came and knocked on her door; apparently, the [**Hospital3 63094**]
found the patient down in the driveway. Daughter called 911 and
then raced outside. Patient just kept perseverating on "let me
up". He was combative and fighting against daughter, [**Name (NI) 63094**],
and eventually EMS interventions.

Taken to [**Hospital3 **]. Vitals on arrival with temp 97.0, BP
149/76, HR 90, RR 22, O2 100%/RA. Per notes from [**Hospital1 **], he was
awake but nonverbal and not following commands. He also vomited
several times at [**Hospital1 **]. Blood pressure there went up to 178/99.
Labs there notable for white count of 10.1, hct 44.0, plt 180,
INR 1.02, Cr 1.8. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical
evaluation.

On transfer, he apparently vomited another 2 times. BP in
170-180s systolic.

Per his daughter, he was recently feeling well with no fevers,
chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches, visual
changes, previous speech or language disturbances, numbness,
weakness, incoordination.

Head CT:1. Right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
surrounding edema. The differential diagnosis for etiology of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage includes traumatic hemorrhage
(contusion) or primary intraparenchymal hemorrhage, including
hemorrhage due to vascular malformation or neoplasm.
2. Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage and probable subdural
hemorrhage within the right middle cranial fossa and adjacent to
the tentorium.
3. No hydrocephalus.
4. Abnormalities suspected in the temporal lobes, left occipital
lobe and pons raising the question of posterior circulation
infarct or contusion.
---
Head CT:Stable appearance of intracranial injury. No
hydrocephalus or midline shift
---
CXR [**11-9**]:FINDINGS: The aorta is tortuous and there are
associated mural calcifications. The cardiomediastinal contours
are stable in appearance. Again noted are bilateral multifocal
opacities involving the right upper lobe, right lower lobe, and
left lower lobe, which have worsened slightly in the interval,
consistent with progressive multifocal pneumonia. Also noted is
perihilar opacification and small bilateral pleural effusions
consistent with a component of heart failure. There is
dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was transferred here and found to have an ICH as well as SAH.
 Unclear if this was all predicated by patient's fall or if
hemorrhage secondary to underlying vascular
malformation(aneurysm or AVM) or hemorrhagic malignant lesion
with subsequent fall. He had no history of malignancy though.
He also had what looked like an early PNA on CXR at admission.
Neurosurgery declined intervention in his case.  He was DNR/DNI
from the beginning of admission.  He was initially admitted to
the ICU for close BP monitoring/treatment and neuro monitoring.
His neurological status did not clinically worsen initially.
His repeat scans showed stability of the lesion.  He did improve
either however.
Medically however, he did poorly.  He developed a bilateral
multifocal PNA.  We assume this is due to aspiration and
probably occured before admission.  He was treated aggresively
with antibiotics but his repsiratory status continued to
decline.  In addition, he developed ARF in the setting of his
CRI.  The reason was uncleasr, but urine eos were negative.
This continued to worsen until his death.  He also developed a
troponin leak(accentuated by his ARF) that continued to
