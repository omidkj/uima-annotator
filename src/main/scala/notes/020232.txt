History of Present Illness:
62 year old male with PMH of asthma, OSA on CPAP, HTN and
hyperlipidemia who presented to his PCP this morning after
experiencing sudden onset right jaw pain. He states he felt
unwell this morning. He went downstairs to have breakfast and
experienced the right jaw pain. He then experienced substernal,
non-radiating chest pain which did not improve. He endorses
diaphoresis, denies nausea or vomiting. He had never experienced
this in the past. The paramedics gave the patient 324 mg of
aspirin, 5 of metoprolol, 4 mg of morphine. In the ED he
received [**Month/Day/Year **] 600 mg, heparin, and eptifibatide.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope. The patient endorses dyspnea on exertion.

Past Medical History:
Asthma
Sleep Apnea on CPAP
Renal stone removal
Left patellectomy
Hypertension
Hypercholesterolemia
pre-op delirium/confusion


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. The patient quit smoking 7 years ago after smoking 1PPD for
many years. He drinks several glasses of vodka/day.

Family History:
There is family history of heart disease in his mother (age
unknown). His father had emphysema.

Pertinent Results:
Cardic cath (prelim): COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated single (1) vessel coronary artery disease.  The
left main
demonstrated no angiographically apparent atherosclerotic
disease.  The
left anterior descending artery was calcified but demonstrated
no
angiographically obstructive disease. The left circumflex
demonstrated
no significant atherosclerotic disease.  The right coronary
artery
demonstrated a 60% calcified ostial lesion along with a totally
occluded
right posterior lateral branch.
2.  Limited hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right (RVEDP 17
mm Hg)
and left (mean PCWP of 23 mm Hg) heart filling pressures.  The
cardiac
index was preserved at 2.75 L/min/m2 via the Fick.
3.  LV ventriculography was deferred.
4.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the right posterior lateral
branch
with a Micro Driver (2.25x12mm) bare metal stent.  Final
angiography
demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no
residual
stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA
comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Acute inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction, managed by
acute
PTCA and stenting with a bare metal stent to the right posterior
lateral
branch.

Renal US: FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.0 cm and the
left kidney measures 11.6 cm. Both kidneys have a normal
echogenicity, without hydronephrosis or calculi. The bladder is
decompressed.

IMPRESSIONS:
1. Interval resolution of right hydronephrosis.

Conclusions
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is
higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global biventricular systolic function.
Aortic valve bioprosthesis with higher-than-expected gradients.
No aortic regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
He presented with inferior STEMI for which he was loaded with
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Heparin, Integrillin and taken to the cath lab
where he had a BMS placed to the right posterior lateral branch.
 He was started on [**First Name3 (LF) **].  The patient initally had acute renal
failure, which resolved with hydration.  One day
post-catherization the patient appeared to go into early DTs
treated with ativan and valium. He was transferred to the MICU.
On [**3-26**] he was intubated after aspirating for airway protection.
He spiked a temp, blood cultures grew gram + cocci and he was
started on vancomycin and gentamicin for urosepsis. His HCT
fell, he was transfused, CT was negative for RP bleed. TEE
showed aortic valve vegetation. He wa
