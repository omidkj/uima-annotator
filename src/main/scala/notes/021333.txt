Chief Complaint:
Language and behavioral changes

None


History of Present Illness:
53 RHW with poorly controlled DM, anemia, hearing loss s/p
cochlear implant on the right was brought to the ED from OSH.

She lives alone and works as a teacher in school. She was noted
to have gradual onset progressive personality change in the
school for last 4-5 days. She was noted to be more irritable and
was noted to be "not her self." Today the problems got worse and
when she was teaching she wrote things on the blackboard which
didnt make any sense at all. She was noted to have speech
problems and would not answer questions in the correct way. She
was not weak or didnt have any other neuro symptoms. She was
taken to [**Hospital1 2177**] ED where vitals : 97.9, 18, 154/83, 62 reg, 99 RA.
She was noted to say "I dont know why I am here" and said that
her
DOB was [**2047**] though she wrote [**2087**] on paper. She underwent labs
which were not available in chart. She underwent CT head which
showed a hypodense lesion in left temporal parietal area. She
was
transfered to [**Hospital1 **] ED for further eval.

EEG [**2140-10-7**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG because
of a slow and disorganized background reaching up to a maximum
of 7 Hz posteriorly
indicative of mild encephalopathy. Additionally occasional left
temporal
slowing was seen indicative of subcortical dysfunction. No clear

epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures were seen.

IMAGING:
CT HEAD [**2140-10-7**]: IMPRESSION: Limited study given significant
streak artifacts from right-sided cochlear implant. However,
there is hypodensity of the left temporal lobe extending into
the parietal lobe with corresponding sulcal effacement. There is
no acute hemorrhage. Differential includes infarct,
encephalitis, or less likely underlying mass with edema.

CTA [**2140-10-8**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged cytotoxic edema in the left temporal lobe, sparing
its medial
portion, and in the inferior left parietal lobe. The sparing of
the medial
temporal lobe makes an infarction slightly more likely than
encephalitis.
2. Unremarkable neck CTA.
3. No evidence of intracranial arterial occlusion or
hemodynamically
significant stenosis.
4. Arterial and venous enlargement in the area of left temporal
and parietal cytotoxic edema, most likely due to hyperemia,
since no definite abnormal vascular nidus is seen to clearly
suggest a pathologic arteriovenous connection. A follow-up CTA
is suggested for reassessment when the clinical grounds for
hyperemia resolve. If this appearance persists, then a
conventional cerebral angiogram could be considered for further
evaluation.
An addendum to this report may be issued when the curved
reformatted and
volume-rendered three-dimensional images are finalized by the
imaging lab.

EEG [**2140-10-8**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG because
of the bursts of left temporal slowing indicative of subcortical
dysfunction. In
addition, throughout the recording, the background was very slow
at 4 Hz
with bursts of generalized slowing indicative of a moderate to
severe
encephalopathy which is etiologically non-specific. No clear
epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures were seen.

EEG [**2140-10-10**]: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the slow and
disorganized low voltage background with infrequent generalized
slowing. This indicates a
widespread encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances,
and
infection are among the most common causes. Excess
