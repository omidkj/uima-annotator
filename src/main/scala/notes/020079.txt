CT abd/pelvis:
1. The gallbladder is distended, with wall edema,
pericholecystic fluid and hyperemia of the adjacent liver. The
findings are suggestive of acute cholecystitis.
2. Severe atherosclerosis of the aorta. There is a penetrating
ulcer vs. focal dissection of the abdominal aorta, from the
level just inferior to the right renal artery origin, extending
for approximately 2 cm.
3. Small amount of ascites fluid adjacent to the liver.
4. Fluid and stranding near the pancreatic head. This could be
related to adjacent cholecystitis, or could be a manifestation
of pancreatitis. There is a somewhat focal dilation of the
common duct to 11 mm in the pancreatic head, which subsequently
tapers.
5. Calcified structures in both sides of the pelvis, which may
represent ovaries. There is a rounded area of fluid between
small bowel loops in the pelvis, which may reflect ascites fluid
or a duplication cyst.
6. Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
.
head CT: evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Chronic
microvascular infarction.
Please note that MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more
sensitive for the detection of acute ischemia.
.
CXR:Question COPD. Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
No pneumonic infiltrate.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 89 y.o. female with  a h/o CVA, dementia, Type 1 DM,
hypertension and "h/o pancreas problems" who presented initially
with chest pain and and found to have cholecystitis and
infrarenal aortic ulceration/dissection.
.
1) Cholecystitis: Patient status post cholecystostomy tube
placement, cholecystectomy deferred due to comorbidities. No
signs of cholangitis, as blood pressure stable, her fever curve
trended down, and WBC count and alk. phos. trending downward.
Her bile fluid grew [**Female First Name (un) **] but ID said to hold on treaating
this unless she is unstable or blood cultures positive for
[**Female First Name (un) **] The antibiotics were first narrowed to cipro and flagyl
and then changed to PO.  Per surgery, cholecystostomy tube
should be in place for 6 weeks and she will be followed by
interventional radiology for this.
.
2) Acute renal failure - The patient had a slight creatinine
bump, likely secondary to dehydration/pre-renal picture given
the cr improved with IVF.  Her lisinopril and atenolol were
initially held but restarted after her ARF improved.
.
3) Aortic dissection ulceration - As repeat scan done at [**Hospital1 18**]
did not show worsening dissection, vascular recommended
improving blood pressure control by uptitrating her regimen as
tolerated. Nifedipine was increased to 120 mg qdaily and she was
continued on atenolol and lisinopril.  She will need a repeat
CTA of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast in [**2-7**]
months to evaluate the focal dissection of the abdominal aorta,
from the level just inferior to the right renal artery origin.
.
4) Non-anion gap acidosis - The patient had low bicarbonate,
likely secondary to biliary drainage, and this remained stable.

.
5) CAD - The patient has a history of remote NQWMI per [**Hospital1 112**]
records, but had no issues here and was continued on all
appropriate medications including nifedipine, lisinopril,
atenolol, and ASA.  Given her LFT elevation her atorvastatin was
held.  It was trending down at discharge and should be rechecked
as an outpatient.  Her statin should be restarted if her LFT's
are normal.
.
6) transaminitis: The patient had elevated liver enzymes, likely
[**1-6**] reactive hyperaemia of liver surrounding inflamed gall
bladder, as this improved during her course.  These should be
checked at rehab and if completely normal would restart
mirtazapine 15 mg daily and atorvastatin 10 mg daily as these
were held
.
7) Diabetes mellitus - Has been on sliding scale in house, and
was initially given 10NPH in AM and 6NPH in PM based on recent
sliding scale requirements.  This was increased per daily needs
and should
