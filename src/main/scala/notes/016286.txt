Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
83 yo Russian speaking male with a history of CAD and a recent
NSTEMI reportedly complicated by cardiogenic shock (hospitalized
at [**Hospital3 **] and discharged to rehab yesterday) presents
from rehab after experiencing CP and subsequent hypotension
following NTG adminstration. At [**Hospital3 **] apparently
underwent cath which demonstrated anatomy not ammendable to
stenting. At rehab today, experienced chest pain and was given
ASA and NTG. He subsequently became hypotensive with SBPs
reportedly in the 80s. Per wife for many years pt had chest
discomfort lasting about 5-10 minutes about once a month at home
that usually resolves with NTG. however for the past 5-6 days he
has had it everyday and at times more than once a day at rest.
this morning he was in bed when chest pain began. after he took
ntg he began to feel unwell and bp was noted to be in the 80s.
he apparently also has been having blood streak in the stool and
urine since admitted at [**Hospital3 **] but was evaluated there.
she also states he has exertional dyspnea on going up the stairs
but denies syncope. pt apparent has not had any fever, chill,
rigor. he however does have a cough with minimal sputum
production.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the pt's initial vitals were stable. He denied
any further chest pain. A chest x-ray was concering for possible
pneumonia and the patient was treated with antibiotics. However
he's afebrile and has a normal wcc. He was also evaluated in the
ED by cardiology who advised against emperic anticoagulation.
The pt is now admitted to the CCU for close monitoring. His most
recent vitals prior to transfer were: HR 60, RR 23, 110/47, 97%
4L
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

================================================================
[**7-18**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. LV systolic function appears depressed
(ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis of the
posterior wall and anterior septum, and hypokinesis of the rest
of the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2138-2-21**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
further reduced.

CXR [**7-19**]
The current study demonstrates left basilar opacity which is new
since [**2138-4-17**], and although appears to be smaller than on
[**2138-7-18**], is consistent with a new left lower lobe
infiltrate that might be worrisome for infectious process. No
short interval change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
demonstrated. There is no evidence of failure, pleural effusion,
or pneumothorax.

CXR [**7-25**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**7-19**], there is increased
opacification
at the right base medially with silhouetting of the heart
border. Although
some of this may merely represent atelectasis, the appearance is
worrisome for
developing middle lobe pneumonia. Unfortunately, the lateral
view is somewhat
limited and does not adequately show this region.

No evidence of vascular congestion.

Video Swallow:
Gross aspiration of nectar thick liquids which the patient was
sensate.
