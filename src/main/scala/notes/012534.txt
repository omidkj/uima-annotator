Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course was significant for the following issues:

* GIB: The patient was initially started on [**Hospital1 **] PPI. The patient
underwent EGD which revealed gastritis but no evidence of an
acute bleed.  She was admitted to the MICU and transfused a
total of 4 units of PRBCs and serial hematocrits stabilized.
The patient initially had 2 peripheral iv, but subsequently
required R IJ central line placement. She underwent colonoscopy
on [**2118-2-1**] which revealed few angioectasias in the cecum and near
the ileocecal valve, with friable mucosa.  No active bleeding
was noted. [**Hospital1 **]-Cap electrocautery was applied for hemostasis.
There were multiple non-bleeding diverticula in the sigmoid
colon and cecum. The patient's hematocrit remained stable and
her diet was advanced.

*CAD: The patient's beta-blocker was initially held in order to
allow accurate hemodynamic monitoring. The patient was
re-started on her beta-blocker prior to discharge. She was
maintained on statin.  Aspirin was held given her significant GI
bleeding history.

*CRI: The patient's creatinine was slightly above baseline upon
admission at 4.4.  This trended down to her baseline ([**4-1**]) prior
to discharge and she maintained good urine output.

*DM: The patient was maintained on 70/30 and RISS. While NPO,
she received half of her 70/30 dose.  Her blood sugars were
somewhat low while in house on her [**Doctor First Name **] diet, so her NPH dose was
reduced.

*Hypothyroid: Patient was continued on synthroid.

*UTI: The patient had a urinalysis consistent with a UTI upon
admission.  Though she did not have symptoms, she did have some
fevers while in the ICU.  She was initially treated with
levofloxacin; however, her urine culture grew Klebsiella that
was resistant to levofloxacin and to bactrim.  Given the
patient's history of penicillin allergy, cephalosporin's were
avoided and she was treated with aztreonam.  She received a PICC
line and should continue aztreonam 1g q 12 hours for 5 more
days.

*The patient's code status remained DNR/DNI per her wishes.  She
was evaluated by physical therapy and found to be able to make
safe transfers and to be safe for home if she uses her
wheelchair.
