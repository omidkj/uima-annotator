BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY:  Ms. [**Known lastname 52593**] is a 77 year old female
who presented to the Emergency Department for rectal
bleeding.  She had previously been discharged from [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2181-3-30**], with a
discharge diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown
source.  The patient has had a past medical history of
diabetes mellitus complicated by nephropathy, hypertension,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and recurrent
gastrointestinal bleeding.  She has had recurrent workups
that have been shown the bleeding to be isolated to the
jejunum, based on the endoscopic capsule.  The patient had
recently been recovering from hospital admission at [**Location (un) 8641**]
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation in
early [**Month (only) 547**].  When she returned on [**2181-5-31**], to [**Location (un) 8641**]
for bright red blood per rectum.  She was admitted for
observation over night and then transfused 2 units of blood
for a hematocrit of 29.6 with subsequent increase to 35.5.
She was otherwise hemodynamically stable.  She was therefore
transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] for
further workup and possible surgical intervention.

ALLERGIES:  Lasix, latex.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, the
patient's vital signs were noted to be temperature maximum,
temperature current of 98.1, pulse 80, pressure 120/70,
respirations 18, sating 95 percent on room air, fingersticks
to 127.  General:  The patient is noted to be normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal
and reactive to light bilaterally.  Sclera are nonicteric.
Neck is supple with no evidence of any lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac examination shows a regular rate and rhythm without
any murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was noted to be soft,
nontender, nondistended with normal bowel sounds.  Rectal
examination is guaiac positive with normal tone.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values on presentation were a
hematocrit of 29.6, white count 10.6, platelets 240.  Chem-7
shows a sodium of 134, potassium 3.8, chloride 100, carbon
dioxide 22, BUN 53, creatinine 1.7 and glucose 56.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Based on her presentation to the Emergency
Department, the patient was admitted to the Gold Surgery
Service, under Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Once on the floor her
vital signs were all noted to be stable.  Shortly thereafter
she was assessed by the Gastrointestinal Consult Service.
Gastrointestinal Consult suggested angiography, if possible
embolization is necessary.  This was performed on [**2181-6-5**].  This study showed - 1.  Aortogram demonstrating patent
celiac superior mesenteric artery and left renal arteries; 2.
Celiac arteriogram demonstrated patent splenic, hepatic and
gastroduodenal arteries; 3.  Selective and superselective
superior mesenteric arteriograms demonstrating distal
irregularity of superior mesenteric artery branches supplying
the cecum and ascending colon with early venous filling
suggestive of arteriovenous malformation.  There was also
blush observed at the inferior jejunal branch.  No early
venous filling or active extravasation was seen.  The
following day, on [**2182-6-5**], the patient underwent a
colonoscopy.  This confirmed the presence of diverticulosis
in the sigmoid colon and prominent vasculature throughout the
whole colon was noted but no arteriovenous malformations were
identified.  Otherwise the colonoscopy was normal to the
terminal ileum.

Based on the patient's recurrent bleeding problems,
consistently low hematocrit and underlying cardiac problems
it was felt that definitive resolution of her bleeding was
necessary.  After consultation with Interventional Radiology
once again it was felt that embolization of her presumed
jejunal arteriovenous malformation was not practical and it
was deemed that a surgical approach would best suit the
patient's needs.  Consequently, a cardiology consult was
sought to assess the patient's operative and anesthetic
risks.  Pursuant to this, a P-MIBI was performed.  This
showed an ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion
of approximately 73 percent.  There were no wall motion
abnormalities.  No evidence of myocardial perfusion defects.

On hospital day #11, [**2182-6-12**], the patient underwent
operative repair of her arteriovenous malformation.  The
postoperative diagnosis was lower gastrointestinal bleed from
a small bowel source with arteriovenous malformation in the
ileum and right hemicolon.  Ultimately the operation
included:  1.  Exploratory laparotomy; 2.  Extended lysis of
adhesions; 3.  Intraoperative endoscopy of the small bowel;
4.  Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis; 5.  Right
hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis.  The patient's
procedure proceeded without any complications and she was
transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, still
extubated.  In her first postoperative night she required
several fluid boluses for low urine output, however, was
otherwise uneventful.  Her perioperative care was complicated
somewhat by low urine output and tenuous pulmonary function.
At times her examination and chest films made her appear that
she might have fluid overload, given the patient's question
of a Lasix allergy.  In time, however, the patient auto
diuresed well and her pulmonary function improved to where
she could be extubated without any problems.  On
postoperative day #4, she was transferred to a normal
surgical floor and kept NPO.  Again her diuresis remained
brisk without the need for any additional diuretics.

On [**2182-6-17**], postoperative day #5, the patient had the
first of what would be several physical therapy evaluations.
This confirmed that she had a significant decrease in
functional capacity requiring help to get out of her bed and
ambulate.  On postoperative day #8, the patient had had
flatus for the first time and diet was advanced to sips.  Her
pulmonary function, had shown some deterioration.  Her
examination showed wet lungs.  After consultation with the
Medical Service, the patient was given a dose of ethacrynic
acid for which she gave a brisk diuresis and again appeared
to improve her clinical status.  On [**2182-6-23**], a dual lumen
PICC catheter was placed with anticipation of longterm
dietary needs and longterm nutritional needs and the patient
was started on total parenteral nutrition the following day.
On postoperative day #11, examination showed rhonchi
bilaterally.  The patient's chest x-rays showed bilateral
effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis.  Consequently
sputum cultures were sent and the patient was started on
Levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia.  This culture ultimately
came back positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus and the patient was subsequently started on Vancomycin
1 gm q. 12 on [**2182-6-25**].  By postoperative day #13,
