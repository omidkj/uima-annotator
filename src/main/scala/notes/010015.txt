Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
fatigue, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pacemaker placement

History of Present Illness:
86M with hx of HTN, DM who presented to the ER today with
malaise, fatigue and found to be in complete heart block.
Patient initially presented to a physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 108**] two days
prior to admission with complaints of 3 days of lightheadedness
and presyncopal symptoms.  The physician checked his heart rate
and found it to be low along with a low BP but told him he was
dehydrated and was OK to go on a plane to [**Location (un) 86**] the next day.
This morning, he continued to feel very bad, complained of
fatigue and malaise and his family brought him to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER.
On arrival to the ER, pt was found to have a heart rate in the
20s with high degree AV block, conducting 4:1.  His BP remained
stable.  He was also found to be in congestive heart failure and
renal failure.  He was given 20mg IV lasix along with ASA 325mg.
 For his heart rate, he was given glucagon and atropine with no
effect.  Electrophysiology was consulted and pt was taken the
cath lab for emergent pacemaker placement.
.
En route to cath lab, pt increasingly tachypneic and on arrival,
was intubated.  A temporary pacer was placed via the right
femoral vein followed by a permanent PCM.
.
Of note, pt has been complaining of abdominal pain for one week
associated with "gagging".  Also with decreased po and poor
appetite.  Unclear what workup has been to this point.

Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes, Hypertension

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 138/68mm Hg while seated.  Pulse was 80
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min,
satting 97% on the vent. Generally the patient was well
developed, well nourished and well groomed. The patient was
oriented to person, place and time. The patient's mood and
affect were not inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.  The neck was supple with
JVP of 10cm.  Pt breathing on vent; decreased breath sounds at
bases but esp at right base; no discernible crackles.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line.  There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4.  The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
but mildly distended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing.  There was trace bilateral edema, warm.  There were no
abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits. Inspection and/or
palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis
dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
.

.
EKG: 4:1 conduction, narrow complex QRS, Q wave in V1
.
CXR: Left perihilar patchy opacity worrisome for pneumonia.
Markedly elevated right hemidiaphragm of unknown acuity.
.
Echo [**2196-5-20**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.
.
CXR [**2196-5-22**]: Single portable radiograph of the chest
demonstrates persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm,
similar to that seen on [**2196-5-21**]. Cardiomediastinal contours
are unchanged. No effusion is detected. Lung volumes are low but
the lungs are clear. The trachea is midline. The aorta is
tortuous. Dual-lead pacemaker is unchanged in position. No
consolidation. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
.
CT abdomen [**5-19**]:
There are bibasilar consolidative opacities with air
bronchograms, which may reflect pneumonia or aspiration. A
lingular opacity in particular is patchy without volume loss and
suggests pneumonia versus aspiration. There are small pleural
effusions.
.
The patient is status post cholecystectomy. There is no intra-
or extra- hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The liver appears
normal. The spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are
unremarkable. There are scattered vascular calcifications. A
simple cyst of 14 mm in diameter in the left kidney is noted.
There is distal calcification in the right main renal artery.
The pancreas is atrophic but has a normal contour.
.
There is bilateral stranding in the pararenal fascia and
paracolic gutters bilaterally, with a small amount of ascites.
.
There is also a small amount of low- density ascites tracking
into the pelvis. The appendix appears normal. There is
diverticulosis throughout the colon. Because there is no
specific segments of the colon along which there is more
stranding than elsewhere, diverticulitis is unlikely.


Brief Hospital Course:
86M with hx of HTN, DM who presents with fatigue and abdominal
pain found to be in high degree AV block, heart failure, acute
renal failure now s/p pacemaker.
.
1. Rhythm: Initial EKG on presentation showed high degree AV
block with 4:1 conduction.  EP was consulted and he was taken to
the cath lab for dual lead pacemaker placement.  Possible
etiologies included acute anterior MI, drugs, increased vagal
tone, and endocarditis.  CK-MB negative x 2. If this were
ischemia, would have expected markedly elevated CKs. An Echo
showed mild LVH but conserved global heart function. He received
keflex x 3 days for prophylaxis and CXR confirmed proper lead
placement.  He will follow up in device clinic.
.
# Pump/CHF: Found to be in heart failure in setting of complete
heart block.  Worsening resp distress lead to intubation.
Following pacemaker placement an echo was performed and showed a
normal EF of >55% and no significant valvular disease. He was
diuresed with IV lasix prn and continued on BB and ACEI.  His
atenolol was changed to metoprolol for better titration and then
changed to long acting Toprol XL prior to discharge.  Prior to
discharge he was also restarted on his home dose of lasix of
10mg.
.
# Ischemia:   TTE showed no focal wall motion abnormalities to
suggest an ischemic event.  He was continued on ASA and BB.
.
# HTN: Patient was continued on his outpatient dose of
felodipine and his lisinopril was initially held in the setting
of renal failure.  His SBP ranged from 130s-17
