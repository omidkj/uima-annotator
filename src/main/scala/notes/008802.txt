PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed a blood pressure of 133/59, heart rate
was 85, respiratory rate was 16, oxygen saturation of 97% on
4 liters via nasal cannula.  Generally, this is a pleasant
female in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements were intact.
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy or jugular venous
distention.  Cardiovascular revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  Normal first heart sound and second heart sound.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended, with normal active bowel
sounds.  No masses or organomegaly were noted.  Extremities
revealed no edema noted.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed a sodium of 134, potassium of 8.3,
chloride of 100, bicarbonate of 26, blood urea nitrogen
of 21, creatinine of 1.4, blood glucose of 321.  Creatine
kinase was 141, CK/MB was 2, troponin of less than 0.3.
White blood cell count was 8.1, hematocrit was 40.3,
platelets were 132.  PT was 13.3, PTT was 27.9, INR was 1.2.
Urinalysis revealed yellow hazy urine with a glucose of 1000,
red blood cells of 32, white blood cells of 74, and trace
protein.  Urine chemistry was as follows:  urea was 499,
sodium was 37, creatinine was 96, chloride was 95, osmolality
was 492, homocystine level was 11.7.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  LENI revealed right popliteal thrombosis.

A CT of the chest revealed right and left pulmonary artery
thrombus.

Electrocardiograms were the following:  In [**2159-2-22**] was
a regular rate and rhythm.  There was leftward axis and left
ventricular hypertrophy.  In [**2160-1-23**], electrocardiogram
showed no change.  On [**2162-5-30**] showed an additional
change of ST depression in I, aVL, V4 through V5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  RESPIRATORY:  For pulmonary embolism the patient was put
on intravenous heparin.  On the second day of admission she
was started on Coumadin at 5 mg.

A transesophageal echocardiogram revealed right ventricular
stress with pressure overload.  Once the patient reached the
therapeutic INR of 2.4 with the Coumadin, she was then taken
off of the heparin.  Throughout her hospitalization, the
patient required 5 mg per day with the exception of two days
prior to admission when she required 7.5 mg.  She was
discharged on 5 mg of Coumadin with advice to follow up with
the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic on Wednesday, [**2162-6-9**].  The
[**Hospital 197**] Clinic telephone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2173**].

We treated her asthma with albuterol and Atrovent inhalers as
needed for her shortness of breath.  However, the patient did
not have any problems with shortness of breath while in the
hospital.  She was also weaned off of her oxygen via nasal
cannula and subsequently saturated at 94% to 95% on room air.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction with troponin levels of 0.3 and 0.7.
Also, her creatine kinase levels were also always within
normal limits.  Serial electrocardiograms were done, and no
changes were found.  Therefore, the patient was taken off of
telemetry.

The patient was continued on her hydrochlorothiazide,
metoprolol, and captopril for her hypertension.  Her blood
pressure remained around the 140/80 range.

3.  DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient was given the glipizide,
but this did not control her sugars.  Her sugars ran in the
upper 200s to lower 300s.  She was put on an insulin
sliding-scale.  By the middle of the hospitalization, she was
put on metformin with a maximum dose of 1000 mg q.d., and her
blood sugar level remained around the low 120s even without
the insulin shots.  She was then discharged on both the
glipizide and metformin.

4.  ENDOCRINE/HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA:  She treat her
hypercholesterolemia, she was given Lipitor and given a
cardiac diet.

5.  PSYCHIATRY:  With regard to her anxiety, she was given
her clonazepam 0.5 mg every day.  The patient did not have
any problems with anxiety during this hospitalization.

6.  RENAL:  Three days prior to discharge the patient
developed a urinary tract infection and was then put on
Bactrim.  However, the Bactrim interacted with her glipizide
and Coumadin, and so she was switched over to the
ciprofloxacin.

7.  PODIATRY:  The patient complained of thickened toenails
while in the hospital.   She was advised to see Podiatry on
an outpatient basis.  Podiatry telephone number is
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 543**].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q.d.
 2.  Glipizide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 3.  Metformin 1 g p.o. b.i.d.
 4.  Clonazepam 0.5 mg p.o. q.d.
 5.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
 6.  Metoprolol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 7.  Albuterol inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d.
 8.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 9.  Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
10.  Atrovent 2 puffs q.4-6h. as needed for shortness of
breath.
11.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d.
