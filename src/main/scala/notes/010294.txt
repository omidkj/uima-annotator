Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with angioplasty


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent
hospitalization for NSTEMI with acute systolic CHF that is
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for c. cath.
Patient was recently admitted from [**2141-4-7**] to [**2141-4-11**] at
[**Hospital1 **] for acute on chronic systolic congestive heart
failure, acute coronary syndrome s/p NSTEMI with intermittent
short runs of atrial fibrillation.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 620**] discharge summaries, the patient was complaining of
mid-upper back pain for 6 months on admission most recently
complicated by shortness of breath and diaphoresis. She was
found to have acute pulmonary edema as well as acute coronary
syndrome. She was admitted to the ICU for further treatment.
In the ICU, she was treated for acute on chronic decompensated
systolic congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema. She was
diuresed with lasix approximately 4 L net negative. Her pOx was
90 % on 2 L NC, and weaning of O2 failed. She would drop to pOx
87 % at rest. She was continued on lasix in addition to
spironolactone on discharge.
Patient also experienced NSTEMI with maximum troponin of 0.176.
She was started on a heparin infusion. The family decided
against intervention and favored medical management at the time.

She was also noted to have anemia with a Hct drop by 9 points
with discontinuation of heparin. She was also treated with a
nitroglycerin infusion to treat recurrent chest pain. Stool
guiaics were negative. She was given one unit of pRBC with
discharge Hct of 36.7.
She was placed on aspirin, plavix, and a statin. She was also
discharged on lisionpril as well and a small dose of
beta-blocker.
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2141-4-10**] for
intermittent and atrial fibrillation. No need for treatment was

recommended. Heart rate is well controlled. The patient will
follow up as an outpatient with both primary care physician and
Cardiology.
Echocardiogram showed hypokinesis in the mid anterolateral wall,
the distal lateral wall and the apex. Ejection fraction was
approximately 45%.
The patient weight on discharge was 112 pounds ([**2141-4-11**]), which
seems to be her baseline.
Patient was brought in by ambulance to [**Location (un) 620**] today for chest
pain. Initial VS were 97.0 HR: 90 BP: 145/85 Resp: 17 O(2)Sat:
94 Low. She reported intermittent chest pain for the last week
and was discharged from [**Location (un) 620**] as above. Yesterday, her pain
returned with 3-4 episodes of chest pain occuring at rest. This
morning while she was walking back from the bathroom very
slowly, the pain returned and it had been persistent since that
time. Initial troponin was 0.046.
Impression was that patient was presenting with her typical
anginal symptoms but that they were not occurring at rest and
with minimal exertion. ECG (not available for review, per
reports ST-depressions primarily in V3-V6 that resolved. )
showed ST depressions while having pain (distribution unknown).
She was given aspirin, NTG, heparin. It was discussed that
intervention was advisable, and patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].
Initial VS on arrival were HR 67 RR 14 BP 127/62 pOx 94 on 3 L.
Pain was 0/10. She arrived on heparin insuion at 700 units and
nitroglycerin infusion at 20 mcgs down to 14 mcgs at admission.
Per reports, there were new ST depressions in I, aVL, and V3-V6.
Patient was pain free. CXR was performed showing moderate
pulmonary edema.
She was taken to the c. cath lab on arrival.
C. cath with left radial approach showed 99 % distal left main
into the proximal LAD. LAD was 99 % at origin followed by
proximal 60 % involving D1. LCx had ostial occlusion.
Collaterals fill a diseased OM1 and OM2 from RCA. RCA had mild
luminal irregularties. Left subclavian was 70-80 % at origin.
BMS x 2 was performed to left main/proximal LAD.
During the procedure, she had transient hypotension while
catheter was in the RCA, which could have represented ?
dampening on the catheter while in RCA - which resolved within
30 seconds. She also had bradycardia while in RCA, which
resolved within 30 seconds. It was favored that this was
probably catheter induced.
After procedure, patient had a small amount of chest pain that
was improved from pre-procedure chest pain. She was sent to the
CCU with nitroglycerin infusion. She was given ASA 325 mg PO x 1
and plavix 75 mg PO x 1. Heparin infusion was discontinued at 1
PM.
On arrival to CCU, CCU team met with patient and family. Per
family, patient not complaining of any chest discomfort but does
feel slightly "faint."
.
On review of systems, patient unable to provide comprehensive
review of systems. She denies any chest pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
[**2141-4-17**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal half
of the inferolateral wall and mild dyskinesis of the distal
inferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
45-50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-16**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
hypertension. Increased PCWP.

[**2141-4-14**] CARDIAC CATH
Patient brought urgently to the cath lab given rest angina in
the
holding area despite maximal medical therapy.  She had chest
pain
ongoing at the time of arrival to the catheterization
laboratory.
Subclavian angiography performed during entry due to difficulty
advancing the guide wire to the ascending aorta.  This revealed
an origin 70-80% stenosis.  An angled glide wire was advanced
past the blockage and into the ascending aorta easily.  A 6
French JL3.5 guide provided good support.  A ChoICE PT XS wire
was advanced into the diagonal and the lesion was predilated
with
a 2.0 balloon which improved chest pain symptoms.  The ChoICE PT
XS [**Name (NI) **] was redirected into the distal LAD.  A 3.5 x 12 mm
Integriti stent was deployed and a more distal overlapping 2.5 x
18 mm Integriti stent.  The Proximal portion of the distal stent
and the 3.5 mm stent were postdilated
