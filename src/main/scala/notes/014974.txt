1. No pulmonary embolus. No aortic dissection.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis with small left pleural effusion.
Pneumonia cannot be excluded especially in the context of
enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, which may be reactive in
etiology.
3. Pulmonary nodules at the left base. Recommend dedicated chest
CT after
termination of antibiotic treatment, especially in the context
of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
4. Emphysema.
5. Hepatic granulomata.
6. Small renal hypodensities, too small to characterize,
statistically likely to be benign cysts.
7. Vascular including, coronary artery calcifications in this
status post
CABG patient.
8. Small fluid collection in the anterior mediastinum is likely
a
postoperative seroma.
9. Cholelithiasis.
