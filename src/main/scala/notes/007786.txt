History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 109180**] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMH of low-grade b-cell
non-hodgkins lymphoma most recently treated in [**2113-8-21**] with
rituxan, and CAD s/p CABG and pacer who was biba from home after
the sudden onset of SOB. Pt states he first noticed the
shortness of breath after he had been walking on his treadmill
for about 4 minutes. He said he had to stop and "didn't feel
right." He tried walking again after a short while and felt the
same. He says onset was relatively sudden, over the course of 45
minutes or so, characterized by tightness, cough, and SOB. No
CP. Pt states he noticed a similar feeling a few days earlier
but it went away. He has had a cough for approx. 1 week which
was also noticed by home home nurse, Pat. It is productive of
mucus "like saliva" but not green or yellow in color. He says he
has felt "congested" during the past week since he began
coughing. No palpitations, F/C/S, or abdominal pain. Says his BM
a little loose today but no other change in bowel movements. EMS
was called and found the patient to be wheezing with a room air
oxygen saturation 89%. He was also tachypneic in the 30s, but
began satting well on NRB. No h/o COPD or pulm disease.

In the ED vitals were 94, 193/132, 25, 100% NRB. EKG was done in
ED which showed paced beats. CXR showed PNA in RLL. He was given
levofloxacin in the ED for CAP coverage (lives at home) and
nebs. He was ordered for cefepime but had not received it by the
time of transfer to the floor, so this was discontinued in favor
of CTX/azithro regimen starting in AM. Stool guaiac negative.

On transfer, ED vitals were VS: 98.0, 150/51, 60, 16, 100% 6L
NRB. On the floor the patient is comfortable and in no acute
distress, providing the above history. Pt expressed uncertainty
with being treated by physicians he does not know and would like
"the most experienced doctor" to perform any procedures that
must be done to him.

rate with frequent early beats.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: no foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema
Neuro: CN2-12 intact bilat, decreased hearing on right (pt wears
hearing aid bilat but was not wearing aid on right at time of
exam), strength 5/5 in UE and LE bilat

Imaging:
CXR: [**2113-11-15**]
Cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural
effusions.
Post-diuresis chest radiograph recommended to exclude underlying
pneumonia in the lower lobes.

CXR: [**2113-11-16**]
Resolution of temporary severe CHF episode with pulmonary
congestion, remaining right lower lobe infiltrate which ought to
be followed.  No other new abnormalities.

Echo: [**2113-11-16**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global biventricular systolic function. Moderate
mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild aortic
regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pneumonia
2. Acute diastolic CHF
3. Non-hodgkins lymphoma
4. CABG s/p CABG
5. Hypertension
6. Mitral regurgitation
7. Pulmonary hypertension
8. GERD
9. Chronic kidney disease, stage III
10. Anemia, likely secondary to CKD

Admitted with acute onset of dyspnea likely multifactorial from
right lower lobe pneumonia and CHF. As per his pneumonia, he was
covered empirically with antibiotics for presumed CAP with
ceftriaxone and azithromycin. As per acute on chronic CHF
exacerbation, etiology was unclear and may have been
precipitated by underlying infection and catecholamine surge
during exertion. He was ruled out for acute ischemia with
cardiac enzymes x 2. Echo showed biventricular hypertrophy and
moderate mitral regurgitation. Patient's breathing responded
well to diuresis with decrease in oxygen requirement and
significant improvement in CXR. Given that he did not appear
total body overloaded and that his creatine increased with
initial diuresis, opted not discharge him on standing diuretics.
He will see his PCP soon after [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] for further evaluation.
