Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3624**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
cardiac catheterization with stent placement
bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 27045**] is a 55F with CAD s/p NSTEMI, poorly controlled CHF
with recurrent exacerbation, and DM1 on insulin pump c/b ESRD
s/p renal transplant who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **]
where she arrived in acute respiratory distress after nebulizers
in CHF exacerbation asking to be intubated. Per notes, she had
symptoms worsening for the past day of shortness of breath and
was satting 89% on 6L NRB, with SBP of 180.  She was intubated,
started on a nitro gtt, and was not diuresed prior to transfer.
Her husband states that her shortness of breath starts suddenly
and she told him he needed to call 911.  This has happened a
number of times over the past week and each time, the onset is
sudden.

She underwent an DCD kidney transplant in [**2154-12-27**].  She has
had a couple of recent admissions into [**Hospital6 204**]
with shortness of breath and volume overload. She was just
discharged yesterday from [**Hospital3 **] after 2 other recent
admission for respiratory distress; she had been intubated,
diuresed and then extubated.  She stated that she still felt
short of breath and does not feel back to normal. She is
concerned about this worsening in her overall condition. She
began her switch back from Prograf to rapamycin while she was in
the hospital (currently on both)

She recently saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the clinic [**12-22**].  In the
setting of repeated episodes of volume overload, worsening
hypertension and increase in creatinine, the concern for the
possibility of transplant renal artery stenosis vs.
Prograf-induced hypertension (hence the transition to rapamycin)
has been raised.  Transplant renal ultrasound was planned to be
completed in the [**Hospital **] Clinic, but no report is available.

In the ED, she was intubated on transfer from [**Hospital3 **].
Nitro gtt was continued for persistent hypertension and she was
given ASA PR.  Initial FSBG was 208 at 6am. Fentanyl and
midazolam were used for sedation and she was transferred to the
MICU with vitals of P 88 BP 152/44, and O2 sat of 97% on AC
400/20/8/80%.

On arrival to the MICU, she is sedated but arousable to voice
and follows commands.  She reports that her breathing is now
easier with the ET tube in place.
