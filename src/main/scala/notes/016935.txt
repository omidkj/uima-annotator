CTA neck/chest [**2181-12-16**]:
1. Multiple cervicothoracic spine and rib fractures, ultimately
concerning for spinal instability at the cervicothoracic region.

2. Non-displaced right scapula and right distal clavicle
fractures.
3. Vertebral arteries intact.
4. Widening of the anterior aspect of the C6-C7 intervertebral
disc space,
concerning for ligamentous injury.
5. Somewhat lobulated pleural thickening along the right lung
apex,
non-specific. Findings could relate to chronic scarring, prior
asbestos
exposure (if patient has history of such) or underlying trauma

MRI spine [**2181-12-17**]:
1. Multiple cervical spine fractures are as previously described
on CTA neck of [**2181-12-16**]. Posterior ligamentous complex injury at
least from C6 to T2, multifocal disruption of the ligamentum
flavum on the right from C6 through T2, and probable injury to
the anterior longitudinal ligament at C6-C7 with widening of the
anterior intervertebral disc space again suggest grossly
unstable cervical spine injuries. Fracture redemonstrated in T2
vertebral body, and possibly in C6 vertebral body.

2. No evidence of cord injury or cord compression. Small
epidural hematoma
noted layering posteriorly in the upper cervical spine.

3. Bilateral pleural thickening with somewhat lobulated contour
in the right lung apex, as seen on CT. Recommend correlation
with prior asbestos exposure and/or history of malignancy.

[**2181-12-20**] Head CT :
1. Resolving right frontal subgaleal hematoma.
2. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

[**2181-12-21**] MRI Head :
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect. There is no evidence of diffusion abnormalities to
suggest acute or subacute ischemic changes. Bilateral opacities
involving the mastoid air cells and also mucosal thickening is
demonstrated in the ethmoidal, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses as
described above. The patient is intubated.

1/114/11 MRI C spine :
1. Limited examination due to motion artifact and superimposed
metal
artifacts related with posterior instrumentation as described
above. Grossly, there is no evidence of spinal cord edema or
cord expansion. A compression fracture is again redemonstrated
at T2 level, apparently unchanged since the prior studies.
Post-surgical changes identified from C3 through T1 levels
consistent with posterior decompression, laminectomies,
posterior arthrodesis and lateral instrumentation at C4-C5
levels.
 2. Mucosal thickening identified at the maxillary, ethmoidal
and sphenoid
sinus as described above. The patient is intubated.

[**2181-12-29**] CT C-T spine :
Interval placement of bilateral posterior cervicothoracic
fusion,
with multiple screws spanning from C4 through T5. No gross
change of cervical alignment. No evidence of immediate hardware
complications.



Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2181-12-16**], the patient was admitted to the TICU.

- [**12-16**]: Admitted to TICU; banana bag.
- [**12-17**]: Started standing Ativan w/ CIWA scale for agitation.
Underwent MRI showing diffuse spinal ligamentous injury in the
cervical and thoracic spine. On log roll precautions until
operative fixation. Started beta blocker 25 TID for
hypertension.
- [**12-18**]:  Underwent C4-T5 spinal fusion with orthopedics.

Post operatively he remained hemodynamically stable and was
gradually weaned and extubated the following day.  His mental
status waxed and waned from highly agitated to somnolent. On
[**2181-12-20**] he required re intubation for somnolence.  He had a
repeat head CT which showed no intracranial hemorrhage and an
MRI on [**2181-12-21**] corroborated these findings. Unfortunately he
remained agitated from alcohol withdrawal and was receiving
Ativan per CIWA scale which made accurate neurologic assessment
difficult.  He appeared to have right shoulder weakness and had
a repeat MRI of the C spine which was unchanged.

His respiratory status slowly improved.  A Chest Xray done on re
intubation showed a left lower lobe pneumonia and his BAL was
positive for H flu.  He was treated with a 10 day course of
Ampicillin and Clindamycin.  He was successfully extubated on
[**2181-12-23**].

He was transferred to the Trauma floor on [**2181-12-24**] and began to
make good progress.  His Ativan was stopped and he was placed on
Zyprexa which proved to be effective.  He was able to tolerate a
regular diet and had multiple assessments by the Speech and
Swallow service to assure his safety.

The Occupational  Therapy service and Physical Therapy service
saw him on a regular basis and as his mind cleared he persisted
with some right shoulder weakness.  He had repeat CT scans of
the cervical and thoracic spine on [**2181-12-29**] which showed no new
findings and he was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] who noted a slight
decreased strength in the right shoulder compared to the left,
possible due to pain.  His incision is dry and healing well.
Currently he wears [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 36323**] brace when out of bed and a [**Location (un) 2848**] J
collar when in bed.

After a long hospital stay he is improving daily especially with
his mental status close to normal. His appetite is great, he is
voiding sufficiently and walking with a walker.  he is being
discharged today so that he can continue active rehabilitation.
