Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical Ventilation and Intubation


History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 yo female with end-stage COPD, DM2, CRF, anemia of
renal disease, diastolic CHF, h/o DVT, PMR, OA, OSA, h/o C diff
who was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-8**] after a COPD exacerbation,
treated with PO steroids and levofloxacin. She was discharged to
a rehab and was doing ok. Of note, she was not on several of her
home COPD meds on discharge. However, her family noted that she
was becoming progressively more lethargic and tired during her
stay. Her O2 had been increased from 2 to 3 liters. Family
denies any fevers, chills, or cough. She presented to [**Hospital 6451**] hospital early today with increasing shortness of
breath. ABG there showed 7.16/139. Intubated there at her
husbands request and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as her prior care was
here.

In the ED, initial VS: 88 138/100 16 97% on the ventilator. A
CXR showed a possible retrocardiac opacity so she was given
Vanc/CTX for abx and 2L NS. BPs trended down to the 80s-90s but
daughter at bedside stated she would not want a central line.
She was successfully managed with IVF and extubated.  She was
then transferred to the floor for further management.

ROS: Further ROS unable to be obtained due sedation.

Past Medical History:
COPD on 2.5-3.5L O2 NC, no h/o intubation, never seen by
pulmonologist, severely disabled, chronic hypercarbia and
history of CO2 narcosis
DM2 x 50 years
diastolic CHF, last hospitalized for this 1 year ago
CRF stage 3, creatinine 2.0 in [**11-14**]
anemia of renal disease on epogen
OSA on CPAP
h/o DVT - patient states that 50 years ago she injured her left
leg, never went to the hospital for it and it might have been a
phlebitis
PMR on steroids x 50 years
OA - particularly left shoulder
osteoporosis, vertebral compression fx [**2138**]
h/o C diff per records but daughter [**Name (NI) 63582**]'t aware, patient states

it might have been 3-4 years ago
h/o fall
cognitive decline, h/o agitation and confusion at night

Social History:
former nurse, trained at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, lives at home with
husband, daughter lives in [**Name (NI) 3307**], quit smoking decades ago

Family History:
asked but not contributory

Physical Exam:

Imaging:
CXR [**2146-12-15**]
IMPRESSION: Status post extubation. Slight improved aeration at
lung bases with residual atelectasis adjacent to effusions.

ECHO [**2146-12-15**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved left ventricular systolic
function. Mild right ventricular dilation with probable mild
hypokinesis. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

CXR [**2146-12-11**]
SINGLE UPRIGHT PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: An endotracheal tube
terminates approximately 2 cm from the carina. An enteric tube
extends below the diaphragm and terminates below the bottom of
the radiograph. Lung volumes are low. There is dense
retrocardiac opacity which could reflect atelectasis or
consolidation. There may be bilateral pleural effusions.
Moderate cardiomegaly is likely unchanged. Scarring at the lung
apices is again noted. Hilar fullness is likely related to low
lung volumes. Aortic arch calcifications are noted. Pulmonary
vascular structures are otherwise normal in caliber.
IMPRESSION: ETT terminates 2.1 cm from the carina. Dense
retrocardiac
opacity could reflect atelectasis, effusion or consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old woman with COPD, type II diabetes,
chronic renal failure, anemia of renal disease, diastolic CHF,
h/o DVT, PMR, OA, OSA, and a history of C. diff who presented to
an OSH with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was intubated
and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care on [**12-11**]. In the MICU,
she was weaned off mechanical ventillation on [**12-12**]. She was
transferred to the medical floor on the evening of [**12-14**].
