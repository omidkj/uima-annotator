         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    RARE GROWTH.

Imaging:
CT abd [**2148-8-12**]: Findings suggestive of colitis although
underdistension is a confounding factorlimiting assessment;
noting lack of haustration along the distal colon, a more
subacute or chronic form of colitis such as ulcerative colitis
could be considered; acute inflammation is not excluded however.
 No clear evidence of pancreatic inflammation or biliary
dilatation.

RUQ U/S [**2148-8-12**]: No evidence of cholelithiasis.  Normal

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 37 year old female with a past medical history of S-2
Tarlov cyst who is status post bilateral S1-S2 laminectomy in
[**2147-6-30**], rheumatoid arthritis, MCTD, recurrent osteomyelitis
and mixed connective tissue disease on prednisone who presents
with epigastric abdominal pain. On arrival to the MICU, the
patient was complaining of abdominal pain, but was
hemodynamically stable.

# Acute Pancreatitis: The patient presented with had epigastric
pain was found to have an elevated lipase an abdominal CT
notable only for chronic colitis. Given her clinical
presentation, she was treated for acute pancreatitis. She was
kept NPO and fluids were ressucitated aggressively with normal
saline. She continued to experience nausea, which was treated
with zofran prn. Her pain was controlled with her home dose of
oxycodone with dilaudid IV for breakthrough pain. Electrolytes
were monitored and repleted as neccessary. The etiology of her
pancreatiis is uncertian- she does report drinking 2
drinks/night, so there may be alcohol component. Additionally,
Rheumatology was consulted and expressed concern that her
symptoms may actually be due to vascutilits in the GI tract,
given the findings on CT and history of prior vasculitic event
whcih led to amputation of the distal phal
