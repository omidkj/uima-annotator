History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 40 y/o female in previously good health who
did not present with predictive symptoms before falling in her
bathroom today.  The fall was unwitnessed, and the family found
her unconscious.  She was taken to an OSH where a head CT
revealed apparent subarachnoid hemorrhage with blood noted in
both sylvian fissures, interhemispheric fissure, and prepontine
cisterns.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for higher level of
care, and was given propofol, etomidate, succinyl choline, and
other sedatives.  She was also noted to have possible
aspiration. At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, Ct angio showed 8 x 13mm focal region
of hemmorhage in high left frontal lobe, also diffuse SAH in
sylvian fissures and basilar cisterns (intraventricular bleed
noted as well in
occiptal horns b/l, 3rd and 4th ventricle). However, no discrete
aneursym was appreciated.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 40 yo F was admitted after being found down and was found
to have a SAH. Subsequent studies revealed that she had an M1
aneurysm which she had clipped via an open craniectomy on [**2172-9-29**]
with concurrent placement of an EVD. Her neurological exam
remained limited, as she did not respond to verbal or tactile
stimuli. Her ICP's remained elevated, and she was started on
hypertonic saline. Additionally she was placed in a pentobarb
coma. On [**10-2**], her serum sodium was elevated to 158 and ICP was
still elevated. Her pupils were felt to be somewhat unequal, so
she was taken for emergent decompressive craniectomy. On [**10-4**],
she experienced fever to 104 F, and at that time, dilantin was
switched to keppra, and she was pan-cultured. Sputum was shown
to grow MSSA, and she was started on Nafcillin and Zosyn. She
underwent trials of ventricular catheter clamping on [**10-6**] and
[**10-7**] but ICPs rose requiring unclamping. On [**10-8**] she underwent
angiogram which showed increasing size of aneurysm requiring
stent placement. Repeat angiogram [**10-9**] showed no spasm but new
small L MCA stroke. On [**10-12**] CSF showed high wbc and she was
started on antibiotics. She had trials of EVD clamping which she
did tolerate in terms of ICPs but CT showed evidence of
hydrocephalus and it was opened.  She was readied for OR on [**10-19**]
for VP shunt placement but had episode of elevated  ICP due to
EVD line obstruction, subsequent CT showed new bleed into L
frontal as well as R sdh.  She was brought to angio which showed
clot in aneurysm. Her exam continued to be poor with extension
of upper extremities and withdrawal of lowers.Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] had
ongoing discussions with family about grave prognosis.  On [**10-23**]
with family present, it was decided to make the patient comfort
measures only.  On [**10-26**] Palliative care consulted for assistance
with transfer to hospice.
