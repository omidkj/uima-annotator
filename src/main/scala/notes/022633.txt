HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old retired
gentleman had known severe calcific aortic stenosis with an
aortic valve area of approximately 0.6 cm2 and aortic root
dilatation.

He was referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for aortic valve
replacement and aortic root replacement.

Cardiac catheterization took place on [**2-2**] prior to
admission which showed a heavily calcified aortic valve that
could not be crossed with guide wires.  The patient also had
severe biventricular diastolic function as well as depressed
cardiac output.  He echocardiogram on [**2195-12-16**]
showed a calcific aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area
of 0.6 cm2 with a peak gradient of 60.  The aortic root was
measured at 4.8 cm.  The patient had a depressed left
ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 30%, and
pulmonary hypertension, as well as moderate mitral
regurgitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Bilateral cataract surgeries.
2.  Status post lumbar disc operation in [**2147**].
3.  Nephrolithiasis.
4.  Sinusitis.
5.  Aortic stenosis.
6.  Congestive heart failure.
7.  .....................
8.  Osteoarthritis.
9.  Gout.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications prior to admission
included)
1.  Lasix.
2.  Potassium.
3.  Celebrex.
4.  Nexium.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination, the patient's blood pressure was 108/72 and
heart rate was 72 in sinus rhythm.  He had increased jugular
venous pulsation.  His peripheral pulses were palpable.  He
had no bruits.  His chest was clear.  He had an aortic
systolic murmur and an apical systolic murmur.  His liver was
up 1 cm and nontender.  No peripheral edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Preoperative
laboratory results revealed white blood cell count was 4.8
and hematocrit was 45.9.  White blood cell count was 4.8 and
platelet count was 154,000.  Sodium was 140, potassium was
4.4, chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea
nitrogen was 16, creatinine was 1.3.  INR was 1.2.
Additional preoperative laboratory work revealed ALT was 19,
AST was 27, alkaline phosphatase was 70, and total bilirubin
was 0.6.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Cardiac catheterization on
[**2-2**] showed no significant coronary artery obstruction,
severe aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, and
biventricular diastolic dysfunction.

Preoperative electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rhythm with
atrial ectopy and a long P-R interval, as well as some ST-T
wave abnormalities in multiple leads, with a question of left
ventricular hypertrophy.

A preoperative chest x-ray showed a slightly enlarged heart
and a small 5-mm lung nodule in the right posterior lung
field.  There was no other evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
disease.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  On [**2-19**], the patient underwent aortic
valve replacement with a 29-mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial
tissue valve as well as a supracoronary ascending aortic
graft with 30-mm [**Doctor First Name **] weave by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  The patient
was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on
a milrinone drip at 0.25 mcg/kg per minute and a Levophed
drip at 0.05 mcg/kg per minute in stable condition.

On postoperative day one, the patient remained on the
milrinone drip at 0.25.  Blood pressure was 120/60, in a
sinus rhythm at 80, with a cardiac index of 2.4.  The lungs
were clear bilaterally.  Postoperative laboratories revealed
white blood cell count was 6, hematocrit was 33, and platelet
count was 160,000.  Sodium was 139, potassium was 4.5,
chloride was 108, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was
20, creatinine was 1, and blood glucose was 110.  The patient
was extubated.  Milrinone was weaned down to 0.125.  The
patient started Lasix diuresis.  Later that evening,
milrinone was discontinued.  Chest tube output was
significant enough not to pull the chest tubes on
postoperative day.

On postoperative day two, the patient remained in a sinus
rhythm with a stable hematocrit of 31.7.  Blood urea nitrogen
was 23 and creatinine was 1.  Lopressor was increased.  Blood
pressure was 119/57.  His diet was advanced.  Chest physical
therapy began.  The lungs were clear.  Heart was regular in
rate and rhythm, and the sternum was stable.

On postoperative day three, the patient was continued on
Lopressor and Lasix as well as aspirin, Zantac, and Colace.
The patient was in a sinus rhythm with a stable hematocrit.
The examination was benign.  The Foley catheter was removed.
The patient was saturating 96% on 2 liters nasal cannula.

The patient was transferred out to the floor on [**2-22**].
The patient was seen by Physical Therapy on the floor.  The
patient was alert and oriented.  The patient was switched
over to oral pain medications.

On [**2-23**], on postoperative day four, the patient did
well overnight.  The chest tubes were removed as were pacing
wires.  The patient was out of bed with physical therapy.
Discharge planning was begun.  The patient remained in a
sinus rhythm with a good blood pressure of 120/80 and was
saturating 95% on room air.  The physical examination was
benign.  The incisions were healing nicely.  The patient
continued to work with Physical Therapy.

On postoperative day five, the patient was discharged to home
with [**Hospital6 407**] services with the following
discharge diagnoses.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post aortic valve replacement and supracoronary
ascending aortic arch graft.
2.  Aortic stenosis.

4.  Gout.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
6.  Status post bilateral cataract surgeries.
7.  Status post lumbar disc operation.
8.  Recent sinusitis.
9.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Discharge medications were as
follows)
1.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice per day.
2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. twice per day (times seven days).

days).
4.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. once per day.
5.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.4-6h. as needed (for
pain).
