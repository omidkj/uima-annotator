Pertinent Results:
[**2153-7-2**] Echo: PREBYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area ,0.5 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
POSTBYPASS: LV systolic function is slightly improved. LVEF
~45-50%. RV systolic function remians normal. There is a well
seated, functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position. There
is mild peri-valvular AI. The remaining study is unchanged from
prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit and brought directly to the
operating room where she underwent an aortic valve replacement.
Please see operative note for surgical details. Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  POD 1 found the patient extubated,
lethargic but oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient
was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no
inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative
weight.  Lopressor was titrated up and additional
antihypertensives were added for better blood pressure control.
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery. All narcotics were stopped due to lethargy and she was
on Tylenol only for pain at the time of discharge and oriented x
3. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged to Mt. St. [**Hospital **] rehab in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
