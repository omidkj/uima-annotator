30%.  Decision was made to manage the patient medically.  He
was also made DNR/DNI.  He was discharged to rehab on
[**2136-12-18**].

Patient was sent back to the Emergency Department today
because of difficulty breathing.  Patient was only able to

respiratory distress on 100% nonrebreather.  HEENT:  Pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light.  OP with dry mucous
membranes.  Neck:  Positive jugular venous distention.  CVP
estimated around 10.  Respirations:  Diffuse rhonchi most
prominent in the right lower posterior lung fields.  Coronary

His electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block.

Chest x-ray with a bilateral infiltrates right greater than
left and bilateral pleural effusions.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
This is an 80-year-old man recently admitted with large
myocardial infarction and now presenting with shortness of
breath and increased respiratory rate.  Chest x-ray
suggestive of pneumonia and possible congestive heart
failure.

1. Pulmonary.  Plan to treat pneumonia with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin in this critically ill patient.  Also plan to
continue oxygen, culture sputum, make him NPO.  Pulmonary
edema may also be playing a role, but will hold on Lasix
given his hypotension.

2. Cardiovascular.  Three-vessel coronary artery disease
holding his po medications.  Will consider restarting aspirin
overall amount for myocardial infarction.

3. Renal.  Creatinine increased.  Check urine, electrolytes,
and Foley.

4. ID.  Blood cultures times two.  Urine cultures.  Sputum
cultures.  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin for pneumonia as
above.

5. Gastrointestinal.  NPO.

6. Code status.  DNR/DNI.

7. Communication.  Discussed with son and told him the next
12-24 hours are critical.

HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient began to have evidence of a further myocardial
infarction with CK of 278 and a troponin of over 50.  Patient
was made comfort measures only.  He is not a candidate for an
invasive intervention.  The patient continued to do poorly
and died at 1 pm on [**2136-12-23**] after extensive discussions with
