Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 281**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronch x 2.

History of Present Illness:
71 yo man with severe COPD on oxygen at baseline, new dx of
NSCLC and recnet GIB who was transferred here on [**6-6**] for
treatment of SC lung CA via photodynamic therapy, now with GIB.

.
Briefly, his OSH course began in late [**Month (only) 958**] when he was admitted
for COPD exacerbation. He was dc'd on [**5-13**] but returned on [**5-17**]
with increased SOB, secretions, hypoxia and rapid afib. During
his hospital course he was found to have RLL PNA and tx with
levaquin, zosyn, tobramycin nebulizers and high dose steriods.
He had a bronch on [**5-20**] with b/l mucoid impacation and
endobronchial lesion. On [**5-28**] he had repeat bronch showing RUL
endobronchial lesion and biopsy demonstrating NSCLC. His course
we c/b by BRBPR on [**5-30**] requiring 11 units PRBCs. [**Last Name (un) **] on [**5-31**]
shoued large sigmoid polyp that was not removed, diffuse
diverticulosis, multiple small polyps and no active bleed. He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] on [**6-6**] for futher management of RUL
carcinoma.
Here he underwent the first 2 portions of photodynamic therapy
([**6-8**] and [**6-10**]) and was awaiting debridement when he developed
BRBPR and tachycardia on the morning of [**6-11**]. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN notes, he
had a large amt of BRBPR in the morning. He began to get
anxious, respiratory rate increased and he became hypertensive
to 170/110 with HR in the 140s. Audible wheezes were noted on
exam, so he was given 20 mg IV lasix for presumed flash
pulmonary edema. He was give IV lopressor 5 mg IV for HR. His
hct and plts were checked and stable. He put out 500 cc to the
lasix, RR rate improved and sats were 95% on 4L prior to txfr.
HR improved to 83.
.
On arrival to the MICU: HR was in the 80s, SBP in the 130s. He
denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chest pain,
palpitations, lightheadedness, fevers or chills. Has a cough
that has been present for 11 yrs. Also c/o 40 lb wt loss in the
past 5 weeks.

Pertinent Results:

[**5-28**] bronch RUL brush cytology: malignant cells, NSCLC, likely
squamous cell carcinoma
[**5-28**] RUL washing cytology: suspicious for malignancy, severely
atypical squamous cells c/w high grade dysplasia/squamous cell
carcinoma
[**5-28**] path RUL biopsy: makedly atypical squamous epithelium c/w
high grade dysplasia or SCC in situ
[**5-28**] bronch cxL few pseudomonas resistant to gent, cefepime,
tobramycin, fortaz, levaquin, cipro, zosyn and amikacin.
Intermiediate to primaxin.
.
CXR: hyperinflated lungs, haziness in LLL (my read)
.
CT chest [**6-6**]:
1. Negative examination for endotracheal or endobronchial
lesions in the central bronchi.
2. Moderate emphysema.
3. Extensive severe, purulent bronchiectasis in both lungs.
4. One bronchiectatic segment with nodular peribronchial
inflammation and nodularity, could represent a bronchogenic
carcinoma or nodular inflammation.
5. Atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary arteries and
major neck vessels.
6.Large likely simple renal cysts arising from the kidney for
which a
dedicated ultrasound examination is recommended.
7.Liver lesions too small to characterize on this examination.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2163-6-22**]
SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is no change in
appearance of underlying pattern of emphysema with bilateral
lower lung ring shadows consistent with bronchiectasis. There is
no evidence of pleural effusion or infectious consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71M PMH CVID, COPD, bronchietasis, new dx of NSCLC
undergoing phototherapy and recent LGIB who was transferred to
[**Hospital1 **] for photodynamic therapy for his lung cancer and management
of rectal bleeding.
.
1 Non small cell lung cancer: He has known COPD and
bronchiectasis but was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] with a new RUL mass c/w
NSCLC for which he received photodynamic therapy. He requires 3L
NC O2 at baseline. His oxygenation need increased slightly
around the time of treatment but improved to baseline by
discharge. He went to OR [**6-13**], [**6-14**] for debridement. His
prednisone was changed from 40 mg to 20 mg [**6-7**] and from 20 mg
to 10 mg on [**6-11**] but increased again to 20 mg [**6-13**], then to 15mg
at time of discharge. This should be slowly tappered. He was
continued on his azythromycin and inhaled tobramycin
prophylaxis. He was also continued on fluticasone inhaled and
nasal spray, as well as xopenex nebulizers. He will need follow
up with interventional pulmonary after discharge and he will
need photodynamic precautions (no UV light exposure, speacial
glasses) for 6 weeks from [**2163-6-13**].
.
2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding: He was transferred with bright red
blood per rectum. He had continuing melena and bright red blood
here despite holding coumadin and aspirin, with intermittent
decrease in hematocrit requiring blood transfussions. He had a
recent colonoscopy at the outside hospital prior to transfer
which showed a polyp and diverticuli. It was noted to be a poor
prep so the colonoscopy was repeated here [**6-17**] and showed: bright
red blood, diverticulosis.
.
3 Pancytopenia: New thrombocytopenia diagnosed during his OSH
admission.  Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] report he is HIT Ab negative.
 This improved during his course suggesting improving
consumption from bleeding possibly.  He also had leukopenia
during his course but this improved by time of discharge and was
thought possibly related to his CVID.
.
4 Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine but this
improved to creatinine of 0.8 by discharge.
.
5 Atrial fibrilation: He remained in NSR and rate controlled on
short-acting diltiazem 60mg qid. His home regimen is 240mg
long-acting in the morning, 180mg long-acting at night. His
coumadin and aspirin were held given his gastrointestinal
bleeding.
.
6 CVID: He had no active issues regarding his immune deficiency.
He normally receives IvIg every 2 weeks and was due for this on
[**6-15**]. He was dosed per his infusion center at [**Hospital **] hospital
in [**Location (un) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 78393**]: 30 gm, tylenol 1000mg, benedryl 25mg
po. pre medication. He ws also due for vitamin b12 1000 mcg sq
(q month) so this was given in house.
.
7 Hyperglycemia: He was noted to have elevated blood sugar on
prednisone so was given a diabetic diet and co
