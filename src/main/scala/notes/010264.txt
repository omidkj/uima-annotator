History of Present Illness:
67M with ESRD on HD, paroxysmal a-fib, recent AVF abscess now
p/w fever and SOB as a transfer from [**Hospital3 **]. He
initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**7-17**] with fever. Of note, he had
an AV fistula angioplasty with a stent(by report) on [**2198-7-5**] in
[**State 108**] apparently for stenosis. On [**7-9**], he started to develop
fevers, and he began to notice a lump appearing over the AV
fistula site as well. On [**7-17**], this lump was observed at his
dialysis session and he was referred to [**Hospital3 **] and
found to have an AV fistula abscess for which he was taken
urgently to the OR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 74087**] [**Name (STitle) 74088**]. Of note, he was found
to be in a-fib at this time. He had a TTE on [**7-17**] followed by a
TEE on [**7-18**] to r/o vegetation which revealed EF 55%, moderate MS,
moderate AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.0) and an 8mm mobile density on the atrial
side of the posterior leaflet thought to be old healed
vegetation or disrupted leaflet. He was treated with antibiotics
and was ultimately discharged on [**7-27**] although further details
of the hospital course are at this point unclear.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] returned to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on the [**7-28**], the day following
discharge with fever and SOB. He was found to have an elevated
WBC to 15.4 from 7.5 the day prior. Last dialysis was on [**7-27**].
VS: T 101.4 p 68 BP 135/79 rr 24 sats high 90s NRB. Sats
improved to 97 on 4L after a couple of hours with improved BP on
nitro gtt. He was treated for presumptive PNA with
vanc/levaquin. He was admitted to ICU at [**Hospital1 **] and found to
have an elevated TnI to 1.37 from 0.14 the day prior. There was
no CK sent. ECG showed sinus with RBBB, no signs of ischemia.
The physicians at [**Hospital1 **] were concerned for possibility of acute
MI and arranged for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
He arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] in moderate respiratory distress, with
vitals T 98.6, p 62 108/86 38 unable to find a sat though by ABG
oxygenating well on 5L NC.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative

[**7-31**] ABDOMEN PLAIN FILM

IMPRESSION:

1. No obstruction or ileus is noted.

[**2198-7-30**]

BALLOON PUMP

COMMENTS:
1.  Successful placement of IABP without complications.
2.  The Swan-Ganz catheter was adjusted and withdrawn by 10cm
3.  Vasopressin was discontinued during the procedure.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Severe mitral regurgitation/flail mitral valve secondary to
endocarditis, refractory hypotension and hemodynamic compromise,
status
post successful placement of IABP.

[**2198-7-30**] ECHO

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus is seen in
the left atrial  appendage. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. Overall left ventricular  systolic function is
hyperdynamic. There are three aortic valve leaflets that  are
moderately thickened Mild to moderate ([**12-12**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
There is no AS. There is partial mitral leaflet flail of both
anterior and  posterior leaflets. There is a large vegetation on
the anterior mitral leaflet  (.9 cm) and moderate vegetation on
posterior leaflet. Severe mitral  regurgitation is seen with
flow reversal in pulmonary vein. There is a 8 mm  gradient
across the mitral valve due to mitral
