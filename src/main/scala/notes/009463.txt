Pertinent Studies:
Radiology Report CTA ABD & PELVIS Study Date of [**2177-5-26**] 5:28 PM

IMPRESSION:
1.  Acute aortic dissection with findings similar to the very
recent prior examination aside from the fact that the false
lumen is now clearly opacified with contrast.  Although
unchanged, there is a small quantity of acute hemorrhage within
mediastinal fat suggesting recent bleeding outside of the aortic
wall although there is no evidence for change or active
extravasation on this examination.

2.  Large pulmonary embolism in the right main pulmonary artery,
of indefinite chronicity, but potentially subacute; correlation
with clinical course is suggested; the main pulmonary artery is
enlarged but right ventricle does not appear enlarged.

3.  Large right-sided thyroid nodule for which further
assessment with
ultrasound is recommended when clinically appropriate.

4.  Large hiatal hernia.

5.  Gallstones.

Radiology Report BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2177-5-26**]
8:53 PM
IMPRESSION:  No bilateral lower extremity DVT.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2177-5-27**] at 11:09:04 AM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate
aortic stenosis. Moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2177-5-29**]
12:20 PM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Worsening bilateral pleural effusions, particularly on the
left, now with complete left lower lobe collapse and atelectasis
in the left upper and right lower lobes.
2.  Stable type B aortic dissection.
3.  Stable right main pulmonary artery embolism.
4.  Subcentimeter thyroid nodule.  As indicated on the report of
[**2177-5-26**], this can be further evaluated with ultrasound.
5.  Large hiatal hernia.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28948**] was admitted to the CVICU on labetolol drip for
agressive blood pressure control, as well as a heparin drip for
her PE.  Both drips were titrated carefully for therapeutic
control.  She was monitored closely and remained stable. LENIs
were negative for DVTs. Transthoracic Echo showed moderate
aortic stenosis, moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral
regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension. Repeat CTA/CTV
showed stable dissection and PE, with no signs of pelvic mass.
She was initiated on coumadin, and remained on a heparin drip
until a therpeutic INR was reached. Her IV antihypertensives
were transitioned to oral, and she continued to do well. She was
transfered to the VICU where she continued to make progress. She
worked with PT and was found to be a rehab candidate.  She
tolerated a regular diet, and voided without difficulty.  She
was noted to have several episodes of O2 sats dipping into the
high 80s while sleeping.  Pulmonology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and felt
that this was not abnormal given her COPD. They felt that O2
sats of 88% or greater were acceptable for this patient, given
that her baseline is likely low.  Of note, a thyroid nodule was
seen on both CT scans, and follow up with PCP is [**Name Initial (PRE) 9304**].  She
will follow up with vascular surgery in a month.
