85 year old woman s/p CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p ct removal ? ptx
AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
REASON FOR EXAM: Assess Dobbhoff placement and pneumothorax. The
patient SP CABG.

Dobbhoff tube projects in the left lower bronchus. This finding
was communicated to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14777**] at the time of the
interpretation of the study. Right internal jugular vein
catheter remains in place with tip in the brachiocephalic vein.
There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly is stable. There has been
interval improvement of the right lower lobe aeration. Mild
improvement in left lower lobe retrocardiac atelectasis. Right
lower lobe nodules are unchanged. Improved CHF with only mild
fluid overload remaining.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. [Intrinsic LV systolic
function likely depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Trace
AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Severe (4+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**12-15**]+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS
The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Severe
central (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a small
pericardial effusion.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to cardiac surgery and preop workup began. She
was found to have an increasing creatinine, likely secondary to
contrast, and nephrology was consulted. She also underwent
carotid ultrasound, echo, vein mapping, and dental consult. She
was found to have a UTI and was started on antibiotics, she also
had a 80-99% left carotid stenosis. She was volume overloaded
and was diuresed with improvement in her creatinine. She was
also found to have a nodular lesion in the right lower lobe, a
PET scan was negative. She was seen by vascular surgery and
thoracic surgery.
On 12 /3 she was brought to the operating room where she had a
