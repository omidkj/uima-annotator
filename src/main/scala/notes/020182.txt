Radiology

Echo [**2140-9-19**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = <20 %). The apical half of the heart is not
seen as there were no apical windows. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular dilation
with severe global biventricular hypokinesis.Mild mitral
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension. No discrete
vegetations identified.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-3**],
biventricular systolic function is now more depressed, the left
ventricular cavity is more dilated, and the estimated PA
systolic pressure is lower (may reflect impaired right
ventricular systolic function). As viewed in the parasternal
windows, valve morphology and the severity of mitral
regurgitation are similar.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT [**2140-9-18**]
INDICATION: Patient with bacteremia secondary to line infection.
Assess for dvt. PRELIMINARY REPORT: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler
images of bilateral subclavian, left internal jugular, axillary
vein demonstrate normal flow and compressibility. There is
non-occlusive thrombus involving the brachial vein. There is an
additional non-obstructive thrombus involving the basilic vein.
The cephalic vein demonstrates normal flow and compressibility.
IMPRESSION: Non-obstructive thrombus involving the left brachial
and basilic veins.

CXR
[**2140-9-11**] No significant interval change since prior.  Pulmonary
vascular congestion.  Bibasilar opacities potentially due to
atelectasis; however, infection is not excluded.

[**2140-9-12**]: In comparison with study of [**9-11**], the PICC extends only
to the left brachiocephalic vein before its junction with the
superior vena cava.  Continued low lung volumes may account for
some of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.
Bibasilar opacification most likely reflects atelectatic
changes.  Possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be
considered in the appropriate clinical setting. The pulmonary
vascular congestion is less prominent than on the prior study.

         "Note, for Amp/sulbactam, higher-than-standard dosing
needs to be
         used, since therapeutic efficacy relies on intrinsic
activity of
         the sulbactam component".
      KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE.    >15 colonies.
         Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available
