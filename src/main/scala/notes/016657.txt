HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient was originally seen
on [**2198-6-20**], in Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2546**] office for initial
history and physical examination.  This 60 year old male was
referred by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  He had a known history of
mitral regurgitation.  Echocardiogram [**2198-4-30**], showed
severe mitral regurgitation with a myomatous degeneration and
bileaflet prolapse, ejection fraction 55 percent, mild
tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate pulmonary
hypertension.  He had a cardiac catheterization on
[**2198-6-20**], the day that he was seen with no coronary artery
disease, and he is now referred for mitral valve repair to
Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], who reported his only symptom as bilateral
lower extremity edema.  No chest pain, palpitations or
shortness of breath.  His catheterization showed mildly
elevated filling pressures, normal wall motion with four plus
mitral regurgitation and ejection fraction of 55 percent.  He
had a right dominant system with a 20 percent right coronary
artery lesion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Mitral regurgitation.

Deep venous thrombosis.

Cerebrovascular accident in [**2197-3-7**], with no residual.

Arthritis.

Hypercholesterolemia.

Mitral valve degeneration.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Transurethral resection of the
prostate approximately eight years ago.

Left ankle surgery in [**2197-5-7**].

ALLERGIES:  He had no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Crestor 10 mg p.o. daily.
2. Ecotrin 325 mg p.o. daily.
3. Lorazepam 0.5 mg p.o. p.r.n. which he says he takes
   approximately three times a week.
4. Hydrocodone for his arthritis which he took p.r.n. on rare
   occasions.
5. Multivitamin.
6. Vitamin E.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is retired and lived alone, but is
engaged.  He lives in [**Location **].  He uses a cane
occasionally for ambulation.  He was a past pipe smoker on
rare occasions but no tobacco otherwise.  He takes one beer
every night.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Repeat examination was done on
preadmission testing on [**2198-8-14**], which showed no change
since his initial visit when he was seen in [**Month (only) 205**].

His carotid ultrasound on [**2198-7-6**], showed no significant
disease bilaterally.  He had dental clearance which was faxed
to the office.

Hi[**Last Name (STitle) 57929**] was six feet, his weight 240.  He was sitting up
in bed in no apparent distress.  He was alert and oriented
times three and neurologically grossly intact.  He had a
grade III to IV/VI systolic ejection  murmur with excellent
S2 heart sound.  His lungs are clear bilaterally.  His
abdomen was soft, obese, nontender, nondistended with
positive bowel sounds.  His extremities were warm and well
perfused with two plus edema.  He is wearing [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings in
place.  He had no varicosities.  He had two plus bilateral
radial, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.  The plan
was for him to have a minimally invasive mitral valve repair
or replacement with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] scheduled originally for
[**2198-8-22**].

LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperative laboratory studies are as
follows:  White blood cell count 7.2, hematocrit 43.7,
platelet count 178,000.  Prothrombin time 12.5, partial
thromboplastin time 31.1, INR 1.0.  Urinalysis was negative.
Glucose 81, blood urea nitrogen 16, creatinine 0.7, sodium
140, potassium 4.1, chloride 104, bicarbonate 28, anion gap
12, ALT 23, AST 16, alkaline phosphatase 73, total bilirubin
0.7, total protein 6.5, albumin 4.2, globulin 2.3.
Hemoglobin A1C 5.0 percent.  Preoperative chest x-ray showed
no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Preoperative
electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at 56 beats per
minute with atrial and ventricular premature beats and left
axis deviation with left anterior fascicular block and left
ventricular hypertrophy.  Please refer to the official report
dated [**2198-8-14**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient did have his surgery on
[**2198-8-27**], the date of admission.  He had a mitral valve
repair with a 31 millimeter mosaic porcine tissue valve.  He
was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition on a titrated Propofol drip.

On postoperative day number one, he had been extubated
overnight.  He had no other events.  His temperature maximum
was 99.2, was in sinus rhythm at 62, blood pressure 109/49,
saturating 95 percent on 4.5 liters nasal cannula.  His heart
was regular rate and rhythm.  His lungs were clear
bilaterally.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.
He was on an insulin drip at four units per hour and Neo-
Synephrine drip at 0.1 mcg/kg/minute.  Postoperatively, his
white blood cell count was 15.4, hematocrit 32.8, platelet
count 155,000.  Sodium 144, potassium 4.4, chloride 111,
bicarbonate 25, blood urea nitrogen 12, creatinine 0.6 with a
blood sugar of 114.  INR was 1.3.  He was transferred to the
floor on postoperative day number one late in the day.  Later
that day, he was anxious and was flailing about a little bit
stating that he could not breathe.  He was very anxious and
had some rapid breathing.  He was saturating 90 percent on
three liters.  Nursing staff worked to calm him down, gave
him a little bit of Morphine and Percocet to help eliminate
his pain.  He had minimal drainage from his mediastinal
pleural tubes.  His Foley catheter was discontinued early
that morning.  He needed a significant amount of
encouragement to cough and deep breathe.  Nursing staff
worked with him on this.  On postoperative day number two, he
complained of being pretty uncomfortable, unable to take deep
breaths, was very anxious.  He was in sinus rhythm in the 60s
with a blood pressure of 104/60.  White blood cell count rose
slightly to 17.4, hematocrit 32.4.  Creatinine stable at 0.9.
His heart was regular rate and rhythm, and he had positive
rub and no murmur.  He had decreased breath sounds on the
right with rhonchi on the left.  He had positive bowel
sounds.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  He
had one to two plus peripheral edema.  His incisions were
clean, dry and intact, sternal and right groin incisions.
Ativan p.r.n. was restarted as were his home medications.
His mediastinal chest tube was pulled.  His chest x-ray the
day prior showed a 10 percent right pneumothorax.  Right
chest tube was left in place on water seal.  Motrin was also
started.  The patient was seen and worked with by physical
therapy.  On postoperative day number three, chest x-ray
showed some right lower lobe atelectasis.  The patient had
episode of bronchospasm with splinting after chest physical
therapy.  He coughed up several large mucous plugs, was
feeling much better in the morning.  He developed atrial
fibrillation after his nebulizer treatment this morning.  He
went from 69 to 100, in atrial fibrillation with a blood
pressure of 106/62, respiratory rate 18, saturating 95
percent on three liters nasal cannula.  His weight was down
one kilogram from his preoperative weight.  He was alert and
oriented and much less anxious.  His heart rate was irregular
and decreased breath sounds but he had better aeration of his
right base but scattered rhonchi throughout, a small amount
of subcutaneous air over his right chest.  He had hypoactive
bowel sounds, but his abdomen was softly distended.  He had
two plus peripheral bilateral edema.  His extremities were
warm and well perfused.  Sternal incision was clean, dry and
intact and sternum was stable.  His creatinine remained
stable at 0.7.  Amiodarone was started for his atrial
fibrillation.  Pacing wires were discontinued.  The patient
was given intravenous Lasix for more aggressive diuresis.  On
postoperative day number four, the patient was doing much
better.  He converted from atrial fibrillation to normal
sinus rhythm at midnight without any change in hemodynamics.
He was hemodynamically stable.  His lungs were a little
rhonchorous bilaterally with
