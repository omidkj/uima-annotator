[**8-18**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2191-9-25**] and [**2195-5-21**]:

Particular interstitial abnormality in both lungs, most marked
in the perihilar left lung has progressed since [**5-20**]
consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. A small component of edema
could be present. The heart is top normal size. There is no
pleural effusion.
.
[**8-18**] CT Abd
IMPRESSION:
1. Uncomplicated acute appendicitis.
2. Right lung base nodular density, new compared to [**2195-5-3**]. Recommend dedicated chest CT for further evaluation.

.
[**8-21**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best
excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). Left ventricular
wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Tissue velocity imaging
demonstrates
an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(<12mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Free wall motion
could not be
adequately seen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small,
circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic
signs of
tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Mild mitral regurgitation. Preserved global and
regional left
ventricular systolic function. Mild right ventricular cavity
enlargement.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion. Mild pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension.
Is there a clinical history to suggest a primary pulmonary
process (e.g,
pulmonary embolism, phenomonia, etc.

Based on [**2188**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings
indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical
decisions
regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical
and
echocardiographic data.

Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.2 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1

TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): 16 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall
normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Mildly dilated RV
cavity. Focal
apical hypokinesis of RV free wall. RV function depressed.
Abnormal diastolic
septal motion/position consistent with RV volume overload.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate to severe [3+] TR. Normal PA systolic
pressure.

PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded.

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal
(LVEF>55%).
3.The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is focal
hypokinesis
of the apical free wall of the right ventricle. Right
ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position
consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen.
6.Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a
loculated
anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of[**2197-8-21**],
the pericardial effusion has resolved. The PA pressures are now
less.

CTA Chest [**8-29**]:
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart and
great vessels opacify well. There is no evidence of aortic
aneurysm, dissection or pulmonary embolism. There is a small
pericardial effusion. Coronary artery calcifications are noted.
There is no pathologic mediastinal, hilar or axillary
lymphadenopathy. There are bilateral moderate-to-large pleural
effusions with associated compressive atelectasis of most of the
lower lobes. The upper lobes are aerated. A tiny right lower
lobe pulmonary nodule is unchanged compared to [**2194-3-6**] and is
therefore not concerning. There is no pneumothorax. Limited
evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates no significant
abnormality.
