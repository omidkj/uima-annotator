History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 73 year old with a hx of HTN and hemorrhagic stroke
with residual R hemiparesis who presents now with
unresponsiveness and new R thalamic hemorrhage.

Family reports that she got on her exercise bike today around
4:00.  About 5 min after she started she complained that she
felt dizzy and stopped.  She complained of a headache, and her
speech was somewhat slurred.  She then "fainted."  They called
EMS.  EMS described that when they arrived she was minimally
responsive, aphasic, had unequal pupils, and decerebrate
posturing.  She was transported to an OSH ED, where she was
intubated at 16:30.  Head CT showed a 2.7 x 1.7 cm R thalamic
hemorrhage with IVH and uncal herniation.  Initial BPs were
180-200, and she was given 10 mg IV. Labetalol at 18:20, after
which BP came down to 140s.  She was given Mannitol 60 g IV at
17:30.  They record that on their exam she had decorticate
posturing of both arms and her right leg and that her pupils
were unequal.  They transferred her here for urgent
Neurosurgical evaluation.  She has been seen by Neurosurgery
here, and they feel that she is not a surgical candidate given
how deep the hemorrhage.

[**2143-11-29**] - Non-contrast Head CT.
IMPRESSION: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered within the
right thalamus with intraventricular extension, mass effect on
the third ventricle and resultant mild hydrocephalus.

[**2143-12-3**] - non-contrast Head CT.
IMPRESSION: No significant change in size of right thalamic
hemorrhage extending into the right cerebral peduncle with
surrounding vasogenic edema.

EEG [**2143-12-5**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to decreased
amplitudes over the left frontocentral and left posterior
quadrant
regions. These findings can occur in cases of material
interposed
between the cortex and surface (as in subdural hematoma) or with

significant cortical dysfunction as in stroke. The background
was slow
and disorganized, and was admixed with bursts of generalized
slowing,
consistent with a moderately severe encephalopathy. This
suggests
dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.

Medications, metabolic disturbances, infections, and anoxia are
among
the common causes of encephalopathy. There were no epileptiform
features. There were no electrographic seizures.

[**2143-11-30**] - CXR
IMPRESSION: Regularly positioned endotracheal tube, regular
gastroenteric tube, slightly accentuated left heart border, no
pleural effusion, no pneumothorax, no pathologic parenchymal
opacities.

[**2143-12-3**] - CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Left retrocardiac density with air bronchograms may represent
left lower lobe pneumonia.
2. New small left pleural effusion.

[**2143-12-11**] - CXR
The tracheostomy is at the midline with the tip terminating 2 cm
above the
carina.  The right PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is overall slight
improvement in almost entire  left lung and right basal
opacities suggesting resolution of the process most likely
representing aspiration/pneumonia.  The left retrocardiac
atelectasis is unchanged.  The patient is after insertion of
gastrostomy which is in unchanged position.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with a right thalamic hemorrhage with
intraventricular extension. The location and the association
with blood pressures in the 180 to 200mmHg range suggested that
this hemorrhage was due to hypertension.  Neurosurgery declined
placing an extra-ventricular drain noting throughout the course
that the patient's large ventricles were consistent with
encephalomalacia throughout.  The patient was put on a mannitol
taper.  Sodium and osmolality was kept below 150 and 320
respectively.  The blood pressure was maintained below a mean
arterial pressure of 130mmHg.  Serial CT-scans demonstrated
stable hemorrhage.

The patient was noted to have a low grade fever and a positive
UA on [**2143-11-29**].  The patient was put on ciprfloxacin.  She was
subsequently noted to have a PNA on a [**12-4**] CXR.  Ciprofloxacin
was held and the patient was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
These antibiotics were subsequently discontinued after the
sputum showed Klebsiella pneumoniae with susceptibility to
ciprofloxacin; cipro was resumed on [**2143-12-8**].

The patient was noted to have a paradoxically elevated PTT in
the setting of subcutaneous heparin.  The heparin was held and
the patient was given 2 units of FFP to maintain hemostasis in
the setting of her intracerebral hemorrhage.  The patient was
kept off of heparin with pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.  With
her condition stable, heparin 5000 units SQ [**Hospital1 **] was resumed on
[**2143-12-7**].

The patient's physical exam fluctuated somewhat within a poor
range during her admission to the ICU.  She was only seen to
follow commands once and only minimally with a Chinese
interpreter; generally she remained highly somnolent, briefly
arousable only to noxious stimuli.  A CT performed on [**2143-12-11**]
to evaluate the underlying etiology to her impaired mental
status revealed the hemorrhage to be relatively stable.  She
persistently required the ventilator for adequate respiratory
status.  She was started and titrated up on baclofen with good
effect on right-sided hypertonia.  It was possible that this
medication contributed to her somnolence, and further titration
was held.

Numerous family meetings were held to discuss her poor
neurological prognosis, ventilator dependency and likely
inability to feed herself.  However, the family believed that
there was chance for recovery and tracheostomy and percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy were performed.

The patient's respiratory status improved enough on antibiotics
and lasix diuresis so that she was able to tolerate prolonge
