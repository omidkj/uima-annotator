History of Present Illness:
77 y/o man with a history of diabetes, coronary disease s/p CABG
[**2162**] and several subsequent PCI, chronic renal failure, copd,
and atrial fibrillation on coumadin presents as a transfer from
[**Hospital **] hospital with chest pain.

He was admitted last week to [**Hospital **] hospital with chest pain
and ruled out for acute MI. He refused catheritization at that
time and was discharged. He was re-admitted sunday [**5-28**] with
recurrent chest pressure, diaphoresis, which began while at
dinner saturday night. He was found with a HR in the field of
160, BP 90s systolic. In the emergency department an EKG showed
an SVT, interpreted as atrial flutter. He had a blood pressure
in the 70s and attempts at chemical cardioversion with lopressor
IV and adenosine were unsuccesful. He then received amiodarone
and versed and became unresponsive with a BP in the 40s. He was
DC cardioverted with apparent return of atrial fibrillation the
60s and SBP 130. (pre and post-cardioversion telemetric strips
are not available).
.
He was admitted to [**Hospital **] hospital. His hospital course was
complicated by recurrent chest pain and a troponin elevation
wtihout CK elevation. It was presumed secondary to cardioversion
as EKGs were without ischemic changes. At some point he
converted to normal sinus rhythym with a markedly prolonged PR
interval. His metoprolol dose was increased to 100mg twice
daily, but this was decreased subsequently as he developed 2:1
wenkebach. He was evaluated by cardiology and was transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of cardiac cath and/or flutter ablation.
His coumadin was held, INR was 1.8 on transfer.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Ventricular tachycardia
Patient presented for cardiac cath, and after admission
presented with a new wide-complex tachycardia, which was
interpretted as non-sustained VT with rate 150. He underwent
cardiac catherization on [**6-1**] in order to identify any ischemic
cause of arrhythmia or conduction delays. Cath showed patent
grafts and ostial stenosis of both right and left main
coronaries, not ammenable to intervention. Patient likely
perfuses via retrograde filling of LAD from diagonal stent and
collaterals. Patient then had EP study on [**6-6**]. However, the
clinical NSVT could not be induced. Two other VT patterns were
induced, and patient became unstable with these. In order to
prevent these unstable VTs, and also to allow adequate drug
therapy without inducing bradycardia, a dual chamber [**Company 1543**]
ICD was therefore placed on [**6-7**]. The ICD was set to pace VT at
a rate of 180. The evening after ICD placement, patient
developed sustained VT with hypotension (SBP 80) and slowed
mentation. He spontaneously converted to NSR, but VT recurred
within minutes. EP was called and ICD was adjusted to threshold
HR 160. Patient was transferred to CCU overnight on [**6-7**] and
received bolus of amiodarone and continued on metoprolol.
Patient then remained in NSR with occasional non-sustained VT
without symptoms terminated with anti-tachycardia pacing by the
ICD. Last run was 11:30 pm on [**6-7**]. He remained hemodynamically
stable. Per EP rec's, patient was started on mexelitine on [**6-8**],
but it was held on [**6-9**] after CNS changes including mental
inattention and sluggishness. His mental faculties returned to
baseline after Mexilitine was held and he had no further
episodes of arrythmia. Based on discussion with the cardiology
attending the plan is to continue on Metoprolol and not start an
anti-arrhythmic and allow the ICD to pace Mr. [**Known lastname 4027**] out of his
Ventricular Tachycardia. If he requires frequent defibrillations
however anti-arrhythmic therapy would have to be reconsidered.
- Mr. [**Known lastname 4027**] will need to follow up with his device clinic
appointment
- The Electrophysiology clinic was notifed of pt's discharge and
contact rehab centre for an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at
[**Hospital1 18**], if you have not heard from them by Wednesday please call
his office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**]

2. Coronary disease
Cath demonstrated patent grafts from prior CABG, with no
significant change since prior PCI on [**9-13**]. Patient was
continued on home metoprolol and Imdur. He was restarted on ASA,
Statin and Lisinopril.

3. Atrial fibrillation
Patient has chronic a fib, with complications including previous
stroke. He is chronically anticoagulated and rate controlled.
Coumadin was held and heparin drip started due to procedures and
tenous course. Following his ICD placement, he was restarted
directly on to Coumadin without Heparin bridge. Rate control
with metoprolol was continued.
- Please continue to check PT/INR every Monday and Friday and
titrate his Warfarin dose for a goal INR of 2.0-3.0.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure:
Patient has baseline creatinine 1.8-2.0, was 1.6-2.0 during
hospitalization. Urine output remained stable. Prior to
discharge pt's Lisinopril was restarted but his Furosemide
dosing was held.

5. Pain control
Patient complained of pain over the ICD site and shoulder pain
following EP study and ICD placement. Pain is likely due to the
ICD and not cardiac event, pain was controlled on Tylenol with
Codeine and lidocaine patch.

6. DM
Patient's home glucotrol and Zestril was held, and patient was
controlled on insulin sliding scale. Fingersticks were well
controlled.

7. Hypertension
Patient was continued on home Metoprolol and Imdur. His home
Lisinopril was briefly held due to an elevated Creatinine but
restarted prior to discharge. His blood pressure improved
significantly during his hospitalization.
