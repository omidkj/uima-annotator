History of Present Illness:
Pt had a radio-frequency tumor ablation of left lung for new LLL
small cell lung cancer, as he was an extremely poor surgical
risk.  A small PTX was noted in the left lung after the
procedure and a pigtail catheter was placed.  A RUL collapse was
also noted thought to be secondary to mucus plugging or
aspiration.  A CXR showed a new lower lobe infilitrate and small
effusion on right.  The Pt dropped his pressure soon after the
procedure and was given 1L of LR and placed on norepinephrine.
MICU was then consulted.
.
Upon arrival the patient was noted to still be intubated and
ventilated from the procedure with a RR=14 and Vt=700.  An ABG
taken at that time was 7.14/73/187.  Labs were as follows:
WBC=12.8, Hct=30.6, Plts=248, PTT=43.8, INR=1.4, Na=140, K=4.8,
Cl-104, CO2=23, BUN=27, Cr=1.2, GLUC=292, MG=2.0, Ca=8.9,
lactate=6.7, albumin=2.8, troponin=0.02.  The Pts respiratory
rate was increased to 22 and 2L of LR was run wide-open with the
result of his ABG= 7.31/37/317.  However, his BP continued to
drop despite maximal dose of norepinephrine and continual IVF.
Given bedside TEE findings that showed a decreased CO and a
mixed venous O2 in the high 50s, a cardiogenic component to his
shock was entertained and dobutamine was added.  This resulted
in transient increase in BP, but it then dropped markedly to
SBPs=40s and epinephrine 1 mg had to be pushed and an
epinephrine gtt was started.  The Pts BP responded well to the
epinephrine, but continual epinephrine boluses had to be
administered to maintain MAPs = 60s.  Thus vasopressin was
added.  A swan was floated and showed his PAP and wedge pressure
to be wnl.  A follow-up Hct was 23, thus 2 units of PRBCs were
given and Hct bumped to 29.  Given the Pts documented adrenal
insufficiency, he was administered 4 mg dexamethasone
empirically.  A follow-up CXR showed the evolution of a large
left sided pleural effusion.
.
Upon being transferred to the MICU the Pt had been given 10.5 L
of LR and was on norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine and
vasopressin.  After coming to the MICU the Pt was able to be
weaned off norepinephrine and dobutamine, maintaining his
MAP=70s.  He received an additional 3L of LR.  Two additional
chest tubes were placed that drained 1.5L of blood out of the
left pleural space.

CXR
Lung volumes are lower. Interval improvement in the diffuse
interstitial pulmonary abnormality over the last three days
represents remission of a component of pulmonary edema though
whether there is interstitial lung disease at the lung bases is
radiographically indeterminate. Tip of a left PIC catheter
projects over the SVC. Right ventricular transvenous pacer lead
projects over the floor of the right ventricle. No definite
pneumothorax is present. A large bulla in the right middle lobe
displaces the anterior junction to the left.
.
Bilateral Upper Extremity Ultrasound
RIGHT SIDE. Jugular vein and subclavian vein are widely patent.
They demonstrate normal compressibility and augmentation were
appropriate and normal respiratory phasicity.
There is an acute thrombus involving the right axillary vein and
extending distally to the level of the brachial vein. This
thrombus is relatively anechoic and is producing expansion of
the vessel. The right basilic and cephalic vessels appear
patent.
LEFT SIDE: There is normal compressibility, augmentation, and
respiratory variation in the deep vessels of the left upper
extremity were appropriate. The PICC line is identified in good
position.
.
EKG:  normal sinus rhythm @ 83 bpm, normal PR/QRS/QT intervals,
normal T waves, no ST segment elevations or depressions.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respitory Status:  Patient developed a small right
pneumothorax and large left hemothorax after IR radio-ablation
procedure for a NSCLC mass in the left lower lobe.  Because of
the hemothorax he had 3 chest tubes placed on the left side by
thoracic surgery.  These drained well after placement and were
removed as the output decreased.  The last chest tube was
removed on the day of discharge.  He had been intubated during
the procedure and remained so on transfer to the MICU.  On
hospital day 3 his sputum grew out MRSA and he was treated with
vancomycin for a 7
