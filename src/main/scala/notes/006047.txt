Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2265**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 41871**] is a 59yo M w/hx of HTN who presents with cough and
lightheadedness for 1 day.  He states that he has been having
intermittent episodes of lightheadness and dizziness for the
past 1 month.  He reports this episodes are associated with
chest tightness and palpitations and he feels a sense of
"warmth" during them that lasts for moments.  [**Name2 (NI) **] denies
shortness of breath with the episodes and has never experienced
them previously.  He states that on the day prior to admission
he developed a cough with white sputum and shortness of breath.
He describes 3 pillow orthopnea and could not sleep because of
his breathing.  He also had lightheadness which persisted which
is why he came to the ED.  He denies sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] denies
fevers, chills, night sweats.  He denies green or brown sputum
production.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.0 HR 220 BP 142/117 RR 24 O2
97% RA. He was found to be in afib with RVR on arrival with
stable blood pressures and otherwise asymptomatic.  He was given
20mg IV diltiazem and started on a dilt gtt at 5mg/hr.  He had a
CXR which showed a ?RLL PNA which was difficult to visualize.
He then began to be more tachypneic with RR in the 30s and
oxygen sats dropped requiring a non-breather. Due to concerns
for PE he underwent CTA which showed no PE.  It showed mild CHF
and pulmonary nodules.  After the CT scan, he was more
tachypneic with RR in the 40s and O2 sats 95% on NRB. Due to
concerns for flash pulmonary edema he was placed on bipap,
started on a nitro gtt and was given 40mg IV Lasix.  BNP was
elevated 10,245. A repeat CXR showed a RLL infiltrate after 2L
NS.  Vitals on transfer: BP 125/91, HR 95 (sinus) O2 sats 100%
on [**1-18**] bipap. ABG 7.53 pCO2 24 pO2 365 HCO3 21.  He put on
1700ml to the Lasix in the ED and an additional 500ml on the
floor.
.
On the floor, he is comfortable and denies chest pain,
palpitations, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis, leg swelling.

IMAGES / STUDIES:

CXR [**2166-5-22**]: FINDINGS: Lung volumes are diminished. There is a
subtle increased opacity in the lower right lung with suggestion
of an underlying reticular nodular interstitial pattern. This is
relatively focal and localized again to the left lower lobe. No
further consolidation is seen elsewhere. The mediastinum is
unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette is grossly stable in size
accounting for patient and technical factors. No effusion or
pneumothorax is seen. The osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Question possible early developing opacity in the
right lung base as detailed above. If equivocal by clinical
standards, consider PA and lateral views in the radiology suite
for more sensitive evaluation.

CTA chest [**2166-5-22**]:
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no pulmonary embolus or
aortic dissection. There is mild cardiomegaly. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis. The
trachea and bronchi are patent to the subsegmental level.
Somewhat diffuse bronchial wall thickening is seen but more
pronounced in the right lower lobe. A few interstitial septal
lines are seen at the lung bases, but there is no alveolar edema
or evidence of overt congestive heart failure. There are
numerous prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, which is
pathologically enlarged, seen in the subcarinal, and AP window
stations most prominently as well as pretracheal. Numerous
sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules are seen in a bilateral, subpleural
distribution (e.g. 3:21, 3:28, 3:31, 3:40). There is no
pericardial effusion. Osseous structures appear unremarkable.
The adrenal glands appear diffusely thickened bilaterally; only
imaged on the non-contrast images (2:61, 2:60).
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Findings only of mild congestive heart failure.
3. Scattered sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules, for which followup
12-month chest CT may be indicated if there is high risk for
primary or secondary lung malignancy. Otherwise, no follow up is
mandated.
4. Likely underlying adrenal hyperplasia, though adrenal glands
not fully evaluated on chest CT. Consider adrenal protocol CT or
MR for further evaluation if indicated.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.

CXR [**2166-5-22**]: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: The lung
volumes are again diminished, and a previously subtle opacity in
the right lung base has dramatically increased in the short
interval. There is also now dense left retrocardiac ill-defined
opacity. There is no evidence of effusion, although the left
costophrenic angle is excluded from view. The cardiomediastinal
contour is unchanged, the bony thorax appears unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Short order significantly increased bibasilar
consolidations in a pattern highly suggestive of aspiration.

Echocardiogram [**2166-5-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global
hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests
normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effu
