Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6578**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 82 year old female with a long history of lung cancer
and bilateral lobectomies and current metastases to brain, as
well as [**Hospital 11491**] transfered from the MICU after being admitted with
a pneumonia.  She was transferred to the floor after it was
decided not to do any more invasive procedures to prolongue her
life.  She was established as DNR/DNI and was brought to the
floor to be given comfort measures.

Past Medical History:
# Lung cancer
- s/p RUL lobectomy in [**2169**] for bronchoalveolar carcinoma
- s/p segemental resection of posterior segment of LUL in [**2173**]
- path = adenoca NOS, moderately differentiated features, neg LN

- repeat mass found in LUL in [**2183**] -> bronchoscopy -> developed
resp failure post bronch requiring ventilation (? [**1-20**] muscle
rigidity from fentanyl)
- path of [**2184-1-22**] mass = infiltrating adenoca w/ papillary
features
- then found L hilar mass -> 6 cycles chemo w/ navelbine + XRT
- L hilar mass enlarged, plus new mass at R lung base (20 x
13mm)
- opted for no further treatment
# COPD
- last PFTs in [**2173**] - FEV1 1.80, FVC 2.05, FEV1/FVC 88 (125%)
# hypothyroidism
# h/o TIA/CVA
- MRA in [**2172**] showed 80%+ stenosis of [**Doctor First Name 3098**], 90%+ of [**Country **]
- s/p L CEA in [**2172**] (h/o R CEA in past)
- [**2182**]: R ICA w/ 70-79% stenosis L ICA w/ 60-69% stenosis
- MRA in [**2182**] showed subacute vs. acute infarct L internal
capsule
- per neuro notes, strokes have been bilateral and had residual
L sided hemiparesis (though not noted on neuro exams)
# Parkinson's
# PVD and claudication
# Cervical stenosis
- s/p anterior cervical disk excision and fusion of screws
# HTN
# Osteoarthritis and osteoporosis
# s/p R THR in [**2171**] for OA
- then had R hip dislocation in [**2181**], s/p closed reduction
# OSA - not on CPAP
# h/o PUD
# Depression
# CRI - baseline Cr is 1.7 - 3.2 in last 2 yrs


Social History:
Lives at [**Location 5583**] House x 2 yrs. 90 pack-yr smoker. h/o EtOH
abuse. Widowed, husband died in [**2171**].

Pertinent Results:
Hct ranged from 30 to 35.1
peak WBC 21.2 on [**6-26**]
Cr peaked at 2.1 on [**6-26**]
Peak blood glucose 166 on [**6-23**]
TroponinT 0.05, 0.11, 0.32, 0.48, 0.53
pO2 66 on [**6-24**] on [**6-25**]
Lactate 2.9 on [**6-24**]
Negative UAs on [**6-23**] and [**6-24**]

Sputum Cx [**6-26**]:
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2186-6-26**]):
      SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.

Blood Cx negative x 4.

UCx negative x 2.

Head CT [**6-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
At least two hyperdense lesions at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] white matter
junction with
associated vasogenic edema worrisome for new metatatic
intracranial disease. Additional areas of vasogenic edema
detected raising suspicion for additional lesions. No resultant
mass-effect or midline shift. Correlation with MRI is
recommended to further evaluate.

Head CT [**6-24**]:
IMPRESSION:  Multiple supra- and infratentorial enhancing
nodules, the
majority of which demonstrate fast diffusion, which argues
against abscess and in favor of metastatic disease.

CXR [**6-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Persistent opacity at the left lower lobe and perihilar
region likely
related to known left hilar mass. Post obstructive changes in
the left base likely represent atelectasis and/or pneumonia.

CXR [**6-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  OG tube tip in the stomach.
2.  Increased opacity over the left upper lobe which might be
due to worsening atelectasis due to known left perihilar mass.
3.  Unchanged right lower retrocardiac consolidation which may
be due to
aspiration or infection.

CXR [**6-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
Worsening left upper lung collapse.
Worsening airspace opacity involving the right lung.  Diagnostic

considerations include pulmonary edema.  Pneumonia is not
excluded.
Small right-sided effusion.

CXR [**6-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
Marked improvement in aeration of the left upper lung with
persistent left mid and upper lung airspace opacity. Unchanged
right mid and lower lung airspace opacity and right-sided
pleural effusion.  Diagnostic considerations again include
asymmetric pulmonary edema and pneumonia.

ECG [**6-24**]:
Normal sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Q waves in leads
V1-V2 suggest the possibility of anteroseptal myocardial
infarction. There are also T wave inversions in leads V1-V3.
Compared to the prior tracing #1 the anteroseptal abnormalities
are new. Clinical correlation is suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 102586**] was brought to the floor on comfort care.  She
was tachypneic at that time.  After discussions with the health
care proxy, antibiotics were d/c'd on [**6-25**], as were other
medications not involved in comfort care.  She was given a
morphine drip and tylenol for fever.  She was given oxygen,
which was d/c'd on [**6-26**].  She was given scopolamine and
hyoscyamine to control oral secretions.  She began agonal
breathing on [**7-19**] and her RR decreased over until she became
apneic on [**6-27**].  She was pronounced at that time.
