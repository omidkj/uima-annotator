History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10132**] is a 49 year old man with h/o HIV/AIDS (last CD4 387
in [**2-5**]), severe COPD (home O2 4-5LNC), who was admitted with
shortness of breath and confusion.
.
The patient has been having shortness of breath for the past few
days that worsened last night. Family has noted that he has been
more confused than usual. Also with mild, non-productive cough
and generalized abdominal pain. No fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, constipation, diarrhea.
.
In the ED, initial VS:99.4 101 133/95 24 99% 4L Nasal Cannula.
Initial concern was for possible infection given AMS. BCx were
drawn, LP was performed with CSF sent for fungal and regular Cx
and crypto Ag. CT head with no acute ICH and no ring enhancing
lesions. Patient was given 1LNS, Ceftriaxone 2g, and Vancomycin
1g. Transfer vitals: 98.1, HR 99, BP 142/88, O2 sat 100% 4L NC
wears @ home, RR 19-21.
.
On arrival to the medical floor, the patient was pursed-lip
breathing and using his accessory muscles, talking in short
sentences with frequent breaks for taking breaths. He was
lethargic, although oriented x3. Initial ABG: 7.34/84/99. He was
treated with IV steroids and duonebs with some mild improvement.
Subsequent ABG: 7.31/77/120. The patient continued to have
difficulty breathing, so was transferred to the MICU for
non-invasive ventilation.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient complained of chest pain -
sharp/stabbing pain in the center of his chest. No radiation to
jaw or arm, no associated nausea/vomiting. Pain resolved without
intervention. Patient was given ASA 300mg PR, and EKG was
obtained -- showed PR depressions inferolaterally, otherwise
similar to prior. Currently without chest pain. Patient still
feeling short of breath.

PERTINENT LABS:
CXR [**2181-5-5**]: The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
unchanged.  Vague upper lung opacities known to reflect
architectural irregularity associated with emphysema appear
similar to the prior radiographs.  There has been no significant
change.  The lungs appear hyperinflated.  There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild loss in body heights among
several mid thoracic vertebral bodies appears similar to the
prior studies.
IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.

CT Head [**2181-5-5**]: No definite ring-enhancing lesions identified.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

EEG [**2181-5-6**]:
This is an abnormal routine EEG in the awake state due to the
presence of a diffusely slow and disorganized background. This
finding indicates a moderate to severe encephalopathy which
implies
diffuse cerebral dysfunction but is non-specific as to etiology.
No
definite epileptiform discharges and no electrographic seizures
are
present. Note is made of a regular tachycardia. Interpretation
is
limited by significant muscle and movement artifact; if the
clinical
suspicion of seizures is high, a repeat study may be helpful

BILATERAL LENI [**2181-5-6**]: no DVT
