HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old gentleman
with a history of a motor vehicle accident in [**2140-7-5**] with a complicated hospital course, including extended
intubation and tracheostomy.  The patient did well after
removal of tracheostomy at this rehabilitation facility on
[**2141-2-2**], but had an aspiration event in [**2141-3-5**].
The patient underwent re-tracheostomy on [**2141-3-30**] at
[**Hospital6 256**].  Bronchoscopy showed
minimal airway narrowing.  Tracheostomy was removed within
the next 24 hours.  The patient was breathing well with good
oxygen saturations on room air and was sent back to his
rehabilitation facility.  He then developed increasing
shortness of breath from [**4-6**] to [**4-16**] and inspiratory
stridor.  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed soft tissue swelling
at the old tracheostomy site which was leading to a
subglottic occlusion.  The patient then required intubation
again.  On [**4-17**], the patient self extubated in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Bronchoscopy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
showed granulation tissue at the level of the tracheostomy
site, significant concentric stenosis, tumorings below the
tracheostomy stoma.  Afterwards, the patient became hypoxic,
requiring reintubation.  He was taken to the Operating Room
for dilatation with a 14 mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) **] tube placement.
The stenotic area was 8 cm below the stoma.  After a period
of observation in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, the
patient was admitted to the [**Hospital 139**] medical service where he
was denying shortness of breath or cough, no chest pain, no
fevers, no chills.
