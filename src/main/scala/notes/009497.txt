Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure
requiring intubation.  The cause of his respiratory distress was
probably multifactorial including CHF, infection, & amiodarone
toxicity.  A chest CT showed apical scarring, bullous changes
and bronchiectasis.  PFTs prior to amiodarone initiation showed
restrictive pattern.  The patient also had suspect underlying
granulomatous disease and COPD with acute volume overload versus
infection. The patient was in the ICU from [**2101-3-5**] to [**2101-3-8**] at
which time the family chose to change their care goals to
comfort measures only.  The patient was extubated and died
within a few hours.
