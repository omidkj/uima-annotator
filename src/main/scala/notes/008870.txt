Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Increasing chest pain and shortness of
breath on exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post CABG
in [**2143**], as well as aortic stenosis, who has been
experiencing increasing shortness of breath and chest pain on
exercise since this past summer.

On the day of admission, she was at an outside hospital
undergoing an echocardiogram for evaluation of her aortic
stenosis, at which time she developed chest pain and
shortness of breath.  The echocardiogram at that time showed
an ejection fraction between 35 and 40%, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.7 cm2.
She did not have any EKG changes at this time, and cardiac
enzymes were negative x 2.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] at that time for cardiac
catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Coronary artery disease, status
post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2143**], a percutaneous
coronary angioplasty of the right coronary artery both in
[**2149**] and in [**2152**].  2) Aortic stenosis with stenting x 2.  3)
Cerebrovascular disease, status post cerebrovascular
accidents and carotid endarterectomy in [**2143**].  4)
Hypertension.  5) Hypercholesterolemia.  6) Osteoarthritis.
7) Diabetes mellitus.  8) Congestive heart failure.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1) metformin 500 mg po bid, 2)
Prevacid 30 mg po bid, 3) Toprol XL 100 mg po bid, 4) Zocor
80 mg po qd, 5) Norvasc 10 mg po qd, 6) Accupril 20 mg po qd,
7) Isordil 60 mg po bid, 8) Plavix 75 mg po qd, 9) aspirin
325 mg po qd, 10) Vitamin C, 11) Vitamin E.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to codeine and eggs which
cause an anaphylactic reaction.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any history of smoking or
alcohol abuse.  She lives with her one daughter.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Ms. [**Known lastname **], at the time of admission,
was found to have a height of 5'0", as well as a weight of
130 pounds.  In general, she was a 78-year-old adult female
in no acute distress.  She had a temperature of 97??????F, heart
rate 79 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 150/41, oxygen
saturation 98% on 2 liters of nasal cannula.  Her pupils were
equally reactive to light and accommodation.  Her extraocular
muscles were intact.  Her neck was supple with the trachea in
the midline.  She had 2+ palpable carotid pulses with no
bruits.  She had no jugulovenous distention or
lymphadenopathy.  Her cardiac examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2, and a III/VI
systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right upper
sternal border.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally, with good air entry and movement.  She had no
peripheral edema.  Her extremities were warm and dry with 2+
palpable radial, brachial, femoral and popliteal pulses
bilaterally.  Her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses
were 1+ palpable bilaterally.  Neurologically, she was alert
and oriented to person, place and time, and her gross motor
and sensory exams were intact.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Her CBC was significant for a
white blood cell count of 5.8, hematocrit 31.4, platelet
count 109.  Her Chem-7 showed a sodium of 137, potassium 4.2,
chloride 104, bicarbonate 21, BUN 12, creatinine 0.6, blood
glucose 122.  Her INR at the time was 1.1.  Her CK and
troponin were negative, and her liver function tests were
within normal limits.  By electrocardiogram, she had some ST
depressions in the lateral leads which were stable from her
previous electrocardiograms.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent
cardiac catheterization which showed [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.6 cm2, an AP
gradient under 40.  She was found to have patent saphenous
vein grafts from her previous CABG, but a proximal 70%
occlusion of her obtuse marginal coronary artery.  She did
develop chest pain during the catheterization which resolved
with IV Nitroglycerin.  A plan was formulated at this time
that the patient would undergo aortic valve replacement, as
well as single vessel coronary artery bypass graft.  As part
of her preoperative preparation, she underwent noninvasive
carotid duplex ultrasound, which showed a left internal
carotid stenosis of 60-69%, with no significant hemodynamic
lesion in the right internal carotid artery.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room on [**2154-2-15**]
where she underwent a redo coronary artery bypass graft x 3,
as well as an aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm mosaic
porcine valve.  Please see the dictated operative note for
full details of the procedure.  She tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred from the operating room to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer,
she was found to have a mean arterial pressure of 74, she was
being A-paced at a rate of 88 beats per minute, and she was
on an epinephrine drip at 0.03 mcg/kg/min, as well as a
norepinephrine drip at 0.2 mcg/kg/min.  The patient did well
in the immediate postoperative period, and was reversed.  She
was slowly weaned from the ventilator, but remained on the
ventilator overnight postoperatively.

On postoperative day #1, the patient did remain on the
ventilator, as well as remaining on an epinephrine drip, as
well as a Nipride and insulin drip.  On postoperative day #2,
she remained on the ventilator, tolerating a very slow wean
from the ventilator.  She also developed brief episodes of
junctional rhythm which was in conjunction with a somewhat
lower blood pressure.  At this time, she was started on
low-dose Lopressor and captopril, and lasix was given for
some active diuresis.  The patient was successfully extubated
on postoperative day #3, but at this time remained in a
persistent junctional rhythm under atrial pace at a heart
rate of 80.  Her Lopressor was discontinued secondary to the
junctional rhythm, and the captopril was slowly titrated up
for control of blood pressure.  She tolerated her extubation
well and began taking sips of clear liquids.  Her chest tubes
were subsequently removed later on postoperative day #3.

On postoperative day #4, the patient was prepared for
transfer to the regular floor.  At this time, her junctional
rhythm had converted to a normal sinus rhythm, but the pacer
was left in place.  She was, at this time, on no beta
blockade, and her captopril was increased to 50 mg tid.

During the next three days on the floor, she continued to
improve, with further clearing of her mental status.  She
remained in a normal sinus rhythm throughout her time on the
floor, and her captopril was discontinued, and she was
restarted on the Accupril she took preoperatively.  She was
also restarted on Norvasc for better control of her blood
pressure.  She continued to diurese well on the floor.  She
was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on
postoperative day #6 for a hematocrit of 26.8.  She tolerated
this well, and was actively diuresed following the
transfusion.

On postoperative day #7, it was felt that the patient was
stable, and ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility
so that she could further build strength and mobility, and
again perform her activities of daily living independently.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was alert and
oriented to person, place and time.  She moved all
extremities and followed commands easily.  Her heart showed a
regular rate and rhythm.  Her breath sounds were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Her sternal incision was open to
the air, clean and dry, with no evidence of erythema or
drainage.  Her sternum was stable.  Her abdomen was soft,
nontender and nondistended, with normoactive bowel sounds.
Her extremities were warm and well-perfused with persistent
1+ pedal edema.  Her temperature was 98.6??????F with a heart rate
of 76 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 164/49, oxygen
saturation 93% on room air.

LABS AT DISCHARGE:  Showed a white blood cell count 10,000,
hematocrit 32.9, platelet count 170,000.  Her Chem-7 showed a
