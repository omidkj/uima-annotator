Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction times two, remote percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty on medical regimen, who
presented to the hospital with chest pain and shortness of
breath which was progressively worsened over the past two
months.

The patient describes increasing dyspnea on exertion but
denied any orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  An
electrocardiogram at the outside hospital demonstrated atrial
fibrillation with a ventricular rate in the 100s which was a
new rhythm for this patient.

The patient was admitted for congestive heart failure
exacerbation and new atrial fibrillation.  Catheterization at
the outside hospital demonstrated 75% left main disease with
diffuse three vessel disease including diffuse left anterior
descending, nonsignificant circumflex, 70% medial, ejection
fraction 20%, 3+ mitral regurgitation, wedge increased at 29,
cardiac output 3.5. The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further catheterization
intervention.

Catheterization results at [**Hospital1 188**] demonstrated 75% left main disease with diffuse three
vessel disease.  The right coronary artery was 80% occluded
with a stent placed to the proximal right coronary artery
with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
Rotablator distally.  There was a 50% residual.

The patient experienced hypotension episode with percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty requiring transient
Dopamine which was further complicated by prolonged bleeding
of the left groin site.  The patient received a total of 320
ccs of nonionic dye.

The patient was admitted to the CCU for observation and
medical therapy for significant left main disease and severe
systolic left ventricular dysfunction.

acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination - The oropharynx is clear.  Extraocular movements
are intact.  The neck is supple, brisk carotid upstroke, no
jugular venous pressure could be visualized.  Cardiovascular

left upper sternal border.  Lungs -good aeration anteriorly.
Abdomen - positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities - no edema, 1+ dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial bilateral lower extremities.  Groin - no
bruit on auscultation, femoral line placed on the left.

LABORATORY DATA:  At outside hospital, white blood cell count
6.5, hematocrit 34.8, platelets 226,000.  Sodium 135,
potassium 4.9, chloride 98, bicarbonate 27, blood urea
nitrogen 25, creatinine 1.2.  Calcium 8.7.

At [**Hospital1 69**], white blood cell
count 10.7, hematocrit 29.2, platelets 190,000.  Prothrombin
time 14.3, partial thromboplastin time 60.0, INR 1.4.  Sodium
133, potassium 4.4, chloride 101, bicarbonate 23, blood urea
nitrogen 18, creatinine 1.1, glucose 187, ALT 13, AST 11, CK
33, alkaline phosphatase 79, total bilirubin 0.9, albumin

Postcatheterization electrocardiogram revealed frequent
premature ventricular contractions, question of normal sinus
rhythm, normal axis, minimal ST depressions laterally with T
wave inversions in aVL.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 86 year old white male
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
catheterization with 75% left main and three vessel disease,
increased wedge at 29, ejection fraction 20%, cardiac output
of 35, transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for intervention to right coronary artery.

1.  Cardiovascular - The patient had his right coronary
artery stented with distal right coronary artery with
rotablation with a 50% residual.  A decision was made for
further medical management of the patient's diffuse coronary
artery disease.  He was continued on Aspirin, Lipitor and
Pravachol and was started on Plavix.

Chest x-ray demonstrated evidence of left sided failure
although the patient felt comfortable as this was most likely
secondary to compensated chronic heart failure.  The patient
was continued on Metoprolol and his Captopril was increased
to 25 mg t.i.d. The patient was diuresed approximately two
liters over the first hospital day with significant increase
in his oxygen saturation and comfort level.

Over the next few hospital days, further gentle diuresis
resulted in decrease of the patient's jugular venous
distention and pulmonary edema until the patient was titrated
back down to his usual daily dose of Lasix.

The patient was noted to remain in atrial fibrillation over
the course of the hospital stay.  Therefore, he was started
on a Heparin drip and Coumadin once his femoral bleeding site
had coagulated appropriately.  The plan at this point is to
anticoagulate the patient over the next few weeks and
readdress the issue of cardioversion as an outpatient.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable over the course
of the hospital stay and was transferred to the floor without
complications.  He ruled out for myocardial infarction with
negative CKs.  The patient is to follow-up with his primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2912**], for further management of his
atrial fibrillation.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient had significant crackles on
pulmonary examination and chest x-ray evidence of heart
failure at the time of admission.  The patient was diuresed
over the course of the hospital with significant improvement
in his symptoms and decreased oxygen needs.  The patient's
Lasix was titrated back down to his usual daily dose of 40 mg
p.o. q.d.

3.  Renal - The patient had a mildly elevated blood urea
nitrogen and creatinine at the time of admission of 25 and
1.2.  He demonstrated excellent urine output over the course
of the hospital stay and his creatinine remained stable at
1.0.  The patient had no further renal issues.

4.  Hematology - The patient had an initial groin bleed on
his left side secondary to catheterization.  This eventually
halted with significant pressure applied to the site for long
periods of time.  The patient did experience a decrease in
his hematocrit and was therefore transfused one unit of
packed red blood cells in order to maintain his hematocrit
over 30.0.

Once adequate coagulation had been obtained at the site, the
patient was started on Heparin drip and was started on
Coumadin therapy for appropriate anticoagulation given his
new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.

The plan is to anticoagulate the patient with an INR of 2.0
to 3.0 for the next few weeks and then consideration of
cardioversion.  The patient left femoral site remained
without bruit and with good peripheral pulses and his
ecchymosis began to resolve over the course of his hospital
stay.

5.  Prophylaxis - The patient was maintained on Protonix and
Heparin drip as prophylaxis during the hospital stay.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged to
rehabilitation in stable condition.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. times thirty days.
3.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lipitor
