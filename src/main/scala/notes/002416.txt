History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 34 year old woman with a history of
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, SVT, s/p PEA arrest
x3, s/p pericardial effusion/window who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for CHF exacerbation and work up for
constrictive pericarditis.  She reports she developed bilateral
back pain with inspiration about 2 days ago that is consistent
with her prior CHF exacerbation. She also reports that she
noticed that her face and lips became cyanotic with exertion at
home. Of note, she reports she has a baseline variable 02
requirement at home from 0-2L. She otherwise denies f/c/change
in appetite, CP/palp/SOB/+dyspnea, -abd
pain/n/v/d/c/melena/brbpr, paresthesias/weakness.
.
At [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, she underwent CT angiogram that was
negative for PE. She was treated for CHF exacerbation with
diuresis. She was noted to be bradycardic to the 40's and
amiodarone briefly dc'd. She had a CT scan of the chest showing
hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. RHC showed question of
constrictive pericarditis with equalization of diastolic
pressures in all four [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] (RAP 27, RVP 25, wedge 27).
.
During this hospitalization at the [**Hospital1 18**], she had multiple
bursts of SVT to HR 150s-160s.  Most recently this morning she
had several minutes of SVT to 160s x 3.  During these episodes,
she was noted to have undopplerable blood pressure per report.
She was treated with carotid massage and converted to her native
rhythm.  She was also given 1 L of IVF with SBP 100.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
+dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, +orthopnea
chronic 2 pillows, -ankle edema, -palpitations, -syncope or
presyncope.

Cardiac history, compiled from OMR: taken from last discharge
summary.
Age:
12: Initial presentation with syncope
13: Seen at [**Hospital3 1810**] for history of syncope, chest
pain and progressive exercise intolerance; diagnosed with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and underwent catheterization in
which LVEDP was found to be 20. Started on ongoing verapamil
therapy.
16: Cardiac arrest secondary to complex tachycardia,
successfully resuscitated. Repeat catheterization showed left
ventricular end diastolic pressure of 36-40 without outflow
tract obstruction. EP showed inducible atrial flutter with a
rapid ventricular blood pressure; dx'ed w/rapid antegrade
conduction and possible pre-excitation. Started on Norpace
(dysopyramide); kept on verapamil and Norpace for many years.
Had occasional palpitations, chest pain and light headedness.
25: Appendicitis during pregnancy, with post-op course
complicated by congestive heart failure, intubated and then
eventually extubated without difficulty; delivered son at 25
weeks.
RECENT HISTORY:
* [**2121-2-8**]: Atrial arrythmias (MAT diagnosed at [**Hospital1 18**],
Afib/flutter seen at OSH), started on amiodarone.
* [**2121-3-1**]: Admitted from [**Hospital 1474**] Hosp w palpitations,
diagnosed as AVNRT, discharged with increased dose of verapamil,

made long-acting.
* [**2121-3-18**]: Pulmonary vein isolation procedure. Post-procedure
atrial tachycardia w/multiple morphologies-->cardioversion.
Respiratory distress and post-procedure
re-intubation<--pulmonary edema and possible contribution of
pan-sensitive klebsiella PNA. Ongoing fevers, ?PE treated with
heparin. Discharged on amiodarone 200 mg TID.
* [**2121-4-5**]: Dyspnea, chest pain, possible pneumomediastinum;
diagnosed with large pericardial effusion; pericardial window
done; post-op atrial tachycardia. During post-op course, had
difficult-to-assess fluid status and was taken to the cath lab;

in holding area had PEA arrest, coded for 1 hour; intubated for

6 days and put on CVVH after cath confirmed volume overload;
extubated; and then reintubated 2 days later for aspiration and

hypoxia, then had pneumothorax as complication of intubation;
ultimately extubated again, treated for pneumonia. Admission
also notable for ARF and pancreatitis.
* [**2121-5-12**]: Admitted from rehab with dyspnea and chest pain,
anemia and mild CHF symptoms; having atrial tachycardia with
varying 2:1 and 3:1 conduction. Discharged [**5-15**].
* [**2121-5-18**]: Admit for shortness of breath, coded for 30 minutes

while being evaluated in ED: PEA w wide-complex near-sine-wave
tachycardia [**3-15**] hyperkalemia; regained pulse in 30 minutes,
after which she had NSR w RBBB; then had wide complex tachy and

BP drop; defibrillated x1 200J, briefly on dopamine gtt.
Admission notable for ongoing fluid overload and
weakness/apparent deconditioning. Source of hyperkalemia was
never clear.  Pt discharged on [**5-25**] to home after refusing
placement to rehab. Pt had been at home  until her most recent
admission to [**Hospital1 1474**].

PHYSICAL EXAM AT DISCHARGE:

Pertinent Results:
EKG ([**2121-10-30**]) demonstrated atrial tachycardia to 164, left
axis deviation, RBBB, biatrial enlargement.
..
CXR PA AND LAT ([**2121-10-30**]):
FINDINGS: Two views of the chest are compared to [**2121-6-15**].
There are bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions (right
greater than left), but much improved from [**2121-6-15**]. There is
a cephalization of engorged pulmonary vasculature, but no overt
pulmonary edema. There is no new
superimposed consolidative process identified. Cardiomegaly and
mediastinal
contours are stable.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral loculated pleural effusions, improved from
[**2121-6-15**].  Mild pulmonary overload, but no overt interstitial
edema.
..
CARDIAC MRI ([**2121-10-31**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. The pericardium demonstrates patchy late gadolinium
enhancement and maybe tethered to the myocardium; the
pericardial thickness is normal. Abnormal septal motion was not
seen. Together, these findings are consistent with but not
diagnostic of constrictive pericarditis.
2. Moderate asymmetric hypertrophy with mildly depressed
biventricular
function due to septal akinesis.
3. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was normal.
4. Moderate to severe biatrial enlargement.
5. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion. Patchy opacity is noted
in the right middle lobe. Correlation with other chest imaging
studies is advised.

ENDOMYOCARDIAL BIOPSY ([**2121-11-3**]):
DIAGNOSIS:
Heart, intraventricular septum, bi
