40mg IV, and levofloxacin 750mg IV x 1. EKG showed afib @90 with
RBBB with ST changes unchanged from prior. An ABG showed
7.34/48/110. Thoracic surgery was notified of her admission
given her recent partial lobectomy for bronchoaveolar cancer.

The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-11-22**],
the focal wall motion abnormality is new.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo female with CHF, CAD, A Fib, h/o stage 1A lung cancer p/w
shortness of breath x 2 weeks.

     In the ED, patient was treated for presumed pneumonia with
levofloxacin, COPD exacerbation with nebs and solumedrol, and
CHF exacerbation with IV lasix. Given lack of fever and clear
infiltrate on exam and minimal suspicion for pneumonia,
levofloxacin was discontinued. Given elevated BNP, CHF on CXR
and exam, patient was gently diuresed with IV lasix x 24 hours.
Pt was transferred to the floor with oxygen saturations 95-100%
on room air.  Pt was assessed by echo demonstrating mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior
hypokinesis which was new compared with her study one year ago.
In the hospital cardiac enzymes were drawn and found to be
within normal limits.
     Patient also has a h/o PAF. Currently on beta blocker for
rate control. She was started on metoprolol and her regimen was
up-titrated. Regarding anticoagulation, she was on coumadin in
past, but this was discontinued due to skin rash. Patient was
also previously on aspirin and plavix which were also
discontinued.
     The patient was continued on her home antihypertensives in
house.  For her diabetes, her rosiglitazone was discontinued out
of concern for its cardiavascular effects.  In its place,
glipizide was begun.   No evidence of mets were discovered
during pt's workup.
      Per the patient's outside attending, anemia studies were
sent to try to characterize/treat her.  Results previously drawn
demonstrated anemia of chronic disease.  Pt was transfused one
unit of PRBC's on the floor for a low crit of 24.5 at the
request of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14069**].  Pt reported feeling more energized after
the transfusion.  She was sent home with follow-up intended to
characterize the etiology of her anemia.

Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet.

You were admitted with a congestive heart failure exacerbation.
You will need to watch your fluid status carefully as an
outpatient. If you develop worsening shortness of breath,
fevers, chills, or chest pain, you should call your primary care
doctor or go to the emergency room.

You should stop your rosiglitazone and start taking glipizide
instead for your diabetes. Rosiglitazone has been associated
with heart failure.

Followup Instructions:
