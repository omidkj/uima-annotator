Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute renal failure, fever, hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous catheter

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 46y/o WF w/ an extensive PMH including ESRD s/p renal
transplant who was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 105047**]
and presents now as a transfer from an OSH where she went with
fever, diarrhea, and hypotension.  Her last admission at [**Hospital1 18**]
was marked by ARF found to be [**1-5**] chronic allograft rejection.
She developed TRALI after a transfusion and was intubated
leading to a MSSA VAP.  Her ICU course was further complicated
by a staph epi UTI and AIN [**1-5**] nafcillin treatment of her VAP.
She eventually failed extubation attempts and received a
PEG/trach prior to being transferred to [**Hospital1 19286**]
Rehab.  At her rehab, she developed fever to 102 and hypotension
to 92 systolic.
.
She was sent to the [**Location (un) 1121**] ICU for these complaints and was
found to have BCX + for coag - staph, GPC/GNR in her sputum, and
a UCX c/w contamination.  She received a CT torso showing, per
report, bibasilar lung consolidation, questionable
nephrolithiasis, and pancolitis.  She was treated broadly with
PO vanco/flagyl (for ? cdiff; cx negative to date), levaquin
(for ? UTI; cx c/w contamination), and vancomycin (for GPC in
blood/sputum; cx w/ staph epi).  She was fluid repleted to a CVP
of 12 but saw no change in her ARF (1.6 on [**Hospital1 18**] d/c -> 3.3 on
readmission).  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
managment of her multiple problems and unresolved ARF.
.
On arrival, the patient was normotensive and afebrile.  Her
trach was noted to have scant tan sputum.  She denied any pain
or SOB.  She was not vocal which limited the history available
but did respond appropriately to questions by shaking her head
Y/N.  She had access with a R IJ triple lumen and 3 PIV.


Past Medical History:
1. ESRD s/p living related renal transplant in [**2182**] [**1-5**] single
left kidney and focal glomerulosclerosis; c/b ureteral
stricture, s/p ureteral stent placement, last exchanged [**3-9**]. On
CSA and prednisone for immunosuppression.
2. HTN
3. Depression
4. Hyperlipidemia
5. Endometriosis
6. severe gastroparesis on [**2193**] gastric emptying study

alcohol or IVDU.  She lives with her husband and son although
most recently living at [**Hospital **] Rehab.

CT head [**9-1**]: There is a subtle area of low attenuation and
asymmetry within the region of the superior right internal
capsule which may represent chronic change. No intracranial
hemorrhage or mass effect is seen.
.
CXR [**8-29**]: This is improved. Moderate cardiomegaly and vascular
engorgement of the hila, lungs and mediastinum are unchanged.
Tracheostomy tube in standard placement. Tip of the right PICC
line projects over the junction of the brachiocephalic veins,
and that of the right subclavian line projects over the superior
cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
.
video swallow [**9-4**]: An oral and pharyngeal swallowing video
fluoroscopy study was performed in collaboration with the speech
and swallow department. Varying consistencies of barium were
administered under constant fluoroscopic video guidance. Without
the speaking valve in place, patient was seen to aspirate nectar
thin liquids. With the speaking valve, patient demonstrated
penetration, but no definite evidence of aspiration. The patient
demonstrated poor oral control throughout the study.
.
CT chest [**9-5**]: 1) Airway obstruction proximal to tracheostomy
tube insertion site. Fluid attenuation of airway lumen suggests
retained secretions and edema as the primary factors, although
underlying granulation tissue is not fully excluded. Edematous
changes extend proximally to the glottic region.
2) Overdistended tracheostomy tube cuff.
3) Collapse of right middle and both lower lobes with impaction
of the airways probably due to areas of retained secretions.
High attenuation material within right lower lobe segmental
airways, likely due to aspiration of oral contrast media.
4) Persistent pericardial and small pleural effusions.
5) Multifocal infectious small airways disease process, slightly
improved since [**2197-8-10**].
.
CXR [**9-7**]: Since prior examination, no significant interval
changes. Persistent bibasilar opacity may represent aspiration
pneumonia, less likely atelectasis. Unchanged retrocardiac
opacity represents atelectasis. Stable right PICC line with its
tip projecting over the brachiocephalic vein junction. No
evidence of pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 y/o WF w/ a hx of ESRD s/p xplant and recent admission for
ARF/TRALI/VAP/UTI/AIN readmitted w/ ARF, hypotension, and fever.
 Managed at NSMC ICU for several days prior to transfer and HD
stable and afebrile on transfer.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from ICU
on HD #30 for witnessed aspiration and pneumonia where she
rapidly improved and was discharged directly from the unit.
.
1. ARF: Pt w/ acute elevation of creatinine compared to her d/c
level. Unclear etiology but likely [**1-5**] transplant rejection
versus ATN ([**1-5**] hypovolemia) versus AIN ([**1-5**] Rx). No evidence of
obstruction on CT but non-obstructive renal stone seen. Uric
acid crystals on UA. Cellcept was stopped and only high dose
steroids where continued for immunosuppresssion. Creatinine
improved with hydration. Baseline Cr 1.9-2.0 since last
admission.  Pt continued on Prednisone, Cellcept was restarted
by Renal after her creatinine began to trend down.  Pt once
again had an episode of elevated Cr while septic from aspiration
Pneumonia.  Her Cr trended down back toward baseline while being
treated with broad spectrum Abx.  Abx were renally dosed.  By
time of discharge, Cr had returned to baseline levels.
.
2. Fever: Afebrile initially but multiple possible sources at
OSH for fever. Treated with vancomycin for MSSE bacteremia (cx
