Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tracheostomy tube placement
central line placement
transesophageal echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
36M with history of obesity, OSA, and cocaine use who presented
to OSH with difficulty breathing and is now transferred to MICU
at [**Hospital1 18**] after intubation for hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory
failure.
.
According to the patient's girlfriend, he has apparently had a
problem with fluid retention (primarily noted as enlarging
pannus and inner thighs) which has gotten worse over the past
two weeks.  He saw his PCP one week ago and was told to double
his Lasix dose.  Over the past week he was noted by his
girlfriend to be sleepy and confused.  She has also noticed that
his breathing has seemed more difficult and louder over the past
several days, though she denies frank wheezing.  He was brought
into the ED at [**Hospital6 33836**] in [**Location (un) 16843**].  There,
he denied fevers, cough, N/V though reported wheezing at home
and "congestion".  He is also supposed to be using BIPAP, but
has not been using it frequently.  No prior hospitalizations for
dyspnea.  his family reports a 15-year history of drug problems
and has recently been using cocaine.
.
At the OSH ED, he had BP 152/76 HR 104 RR 32 89-90% NRB. He was
given BIPAP, Lasix 80mg IV, an inch of nitro paste, 125mg
Solumedrol, Rocephin 2g IV, and Azithromycin 500mg IV.  The
patient could not tolerate BiPAP in the ED and had an ABG of
7.17/109/62. He was intubated with 40mg etomidate, 200mg
succinylcholine and ativan.  Post-intubation, ABG was
7.27/81/137. Tox screen was negative. He is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation.

Pertinent studies:
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler
ultrasound of the left and right common femoral, superficial
femoral, and popliteal veins was performed. Although this study
was limited due to patient body habitus, flow and appropriate
Doppler waveforms, and compressibility, and augmentation was
seen within all of these vessels. No intraluminal thrombus is
identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right or left lower extremity DVT.
.
TEE:
Conclusions:
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler  or saline contrast with maneuvers, though saline
contrast injection was  suboptimal due to long transit time to
the heart. There is mild regional left  ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the septum. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending,  transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally  normal with good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac shunt. Mild septal hypokinesis.
.
VQ Scan:
INTERPRETATION:
Ventilation images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in only 3
views, limited by the patient body habitus. Perfusion images
were obtained in the same 3 views.
There is mild heterogeneity demonstrated with matched perfusion
and ventilation.The patient is noted to be intubated.
IMPRESSION: Limited study. No obvious evidence for pulmonary
embolism.
.
RUQ U/S:
FINDINGS: Focused ultrasound of the gallbladder was performed.
The gallbladder is filled with echogenic material consistent
with sludge, similar to the prior study. There is no gallbladder
wall edema. The gallbladder is not tensely distended. No
pericholecystic fluid is identified.
IMPRESSION: Sludge-filled gallbladder without evidence for
cholecystitis. The overall appearance is similar to the prior
study.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure:  Pt has a history of
OSA and presented to the OSH with dyspnea, confusion and
hypercarbia on ABG, which prompted his intubation, he was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for futher care.  Etiology of respiratory
failure was most likely PE worsened by obesity hypoventilation
and CHF.  Patient had negative LENIs and an indeterminate VQ
scan (unable to obtain CT scan due to size/weight), but given
significant risk factors, high A:a gradient, persistent elevated
oxygen requirements after 10 L diuresis, and marked improvement
of oxygenation after anticoagulation, PE was ultimately felt to
be the primary cause of his respiratory failure.  He is
currently in the process of uptitrating coumadin for goal INR of
[**2-28**].  Given his high PEEP requirements, a prolonged wean was
anticipated and the patient had a trach placed in the OR.  He
continues to receive Albuterol and Ipratropium MDIs PRN and has
the head of the bed elevated as much as tolerated to relieve the
weight on his lungs.  He was weaned from IV sedation and
currently has a fentanyl patch, lorazapam via dophoff, and
Haldol 50 mg PO TID with PRNs for agitation - QT interval has
been 0.22-0.35.  He will continue on Lasix via dophoff for
further diuresis.  He continues to wean from the ventilator and
is currently on PS of 15, PEEP of 14 and FiO2 of 50% with oxygen
saturation 91-95%.
.
# Fevers: Early in his hospital course he completed a course of
Zosyn for ventilator associated pneumonia and associated septic
shock during his first week of hospitalization.  During his
second week of his hospitalization he developed approximately
one week of fevers up to 103.7.  Etiolog
