Admission Date:  [**2177-10-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2177-10-29**]

Date of Birth:   [**2117-5-16**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Squeezing chest pain and dizziness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 60-year-old man
with history of coronary artery disease status post MI in
[**2165**], RCA stent in [**2170**] for a 90% mid stenosis of the RCA who
was admitted on [**6-3**] for chest pain.  Dobutamine MIBI at
that time revealed a partially reversible inferior defect
without any EKG changes or symptoms during the exam. The
ejection fraction at that time was 60%.  No intervention was
done as patient refused and he was managed medically.

From that time he has been in his usual state of health until
presenting today with a sudden squeezing sensation in his
chest starting approximately 2 PM on the day of admission
which was relieved with sublingual Nitroglycerin.  The
patient returned approximately six hours later at which time
he took another Nitroglycerin tablet and called EMS to bring
him to the Emergency Department.  The chest pain was
associated with nausea, diaphoresis and dizziness.  He also
had worsening shortness of breath at the time.  The pain did
not radiate anywhere.

In the Emergency Department, he was given Atrovent
nebulizers, oxygen and sublingual Nitroglycerin times two.
He was started on a heparin drip.  Shortly thereafter he was
found to be in sinus bradycardia with a rate in the 30s with
stable blood pressure and worsening O2 saturation to the 70s.
He was placed on a nonrebreather mask and given 0.5 mg of
Atropine with good response.  He was diuresed with Lasix for
symptoms of heart failure.  He was then admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
in [**2165**] and RCA stent in [**2170**].
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home O2.
4.  Gastritis.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6.  Right eye blindness secondary to trauma.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Lipitor.
2.  Imdur.
Both of which cause rash and hives.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Atenolol 50 mg q. day.
2.  Lisinopril 5 mg q. day.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
4.  Isosorbide Dinitrate 10 mg t.i.d.
5.  Combivent inhaler.
6.  Sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n.
7.  Home O2.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is a former pilot.  He has a 40 pack
year smoking history.  He quit two years ago.  Denies any
alcohol or drug use.  He is a widower.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died in his 60s of heart disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission he was afebrile at 97.3
F.  Blood pressure was 116/65, heart rate 78, respiratory
rate 22 and he was saturating at 94% on six liters by nasal
cannula.  In general he appeared ill and uncomfortable.  His
skin was dusky.  On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, his
right eye was obviously status post traumatic injury.  His
left pupil was reactive.  He had a very dry oral mucosa.  His
neck had normal jugular venous pressure, but he was sitting
upright.  He had 2+ carotid pulses bilaterally without bruit.
Heart exam had a distant S1, S2 with no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  His lungs were clear bilaterally without wheeze.
His abdomen was obese, soft and nontender without hepatic
enlargement.  He had positive bowel sounds.  Extremities had
2+ pitting edema bilaterally with preserved DP pulses.  His
digits were cyanotic and he had changes of chronic venous
stasis.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Revealed a white blood cell
count of 7.9, hematocrit 53.9, platelets of 147.  His coags
were normal.  Chem-7 was remarkable only for a potassium of
3.6.  BUN and creatinine of 11 and 1.1.  First set of CKs
drawn in the Emergency Department was 68.

Chest x-ray revealed low lung volumes, mild interstitial
edema, bilateral lower lobe opacities resembling atelectasis
versus consolidation.

EKG was sinus at 80 beats per minute with a first degree AV
block, right axis deviation, Q waves in V1 through V3 and RV
strain pattern likely secondary to his chronic lung disease.
he had [**Hospital1 **]-atrial abnormalities as well.

Telemetry from the bradycardic event in the Emergency
Department revealed sinus bradycardia at 38 beats per minute.

Echocardiogram from [**2177-6-11**] revealed LV wall thickness,
cavity size and systolic function were normal with an
ejection fraction of greater than 55%.  It was poor quality
study, however not ruling out focal wall motion
abnormalities.  He did have significant AR at the time which
was not quantified.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  A - Rhythm.  The patient's bradycardia
was thought to be due to either a vagal episode induced by
hypoxemia or induced by recurrent right coronary artery
disease.  He was admitted to the CCU and monitored on
Telemetry.  He had no further episodes of bradycardia during
hospitalization.  His blood pressure was controlled with an
IV Nitroglycerin drip and he was started on low dose
Captopril.  His beta blocker was held because of his
bradycardia.

He was taken to the Cath Lab on [**2177-10-28**] because of his
inability to lie flat.  A right radial approach was
undertaken.  Cath revealed elevated right sided pressures
with a pulmonary artery pressure of 61/34 and a mean of 46.
Wedge pressure was 22.  Cardiac output and index were 6.2 and
2.9 respectively.  SVR was 1148.  His LV ejection fraction
was 64%.  Coronary angiography revealed a patent RCA stent,
50% OM2 lesion and 40% proximal LAD lesion.  He also had 1 to
2+ AR.

It was felt that his bradycardia was not cardiac in origin.
More than likely it was due to a hypoxemic event as his O2
saturation was found to be in the 70s when the event occurred
and hypoxemia may have lead to a vagal response causing his
bradycardia and subsequent symptoms of dizziness, diaphoresis
and nausea.

Prior to discharge the patient walked in the [**Doctor Last Name **] with
Physical Therapy and found that his heart rate elevated to
140.  Because of that, he was continued on his Atenolol.
Because of his preserved ejection fraction, it was felt that
he did not require afterload reduction to the degree that he
had prior to admission.  His Isordil was discontinued, but he
was continued on his 5 mg of Lisinopril.  He was also
continued on daily aspirin of 325 mg and Lasix 20 mg b.i.d.

2.  PULMONARY:  Patient has a long standing history of severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Upon arrival to the
CCU, his initial O2 sat was 78% which came up to the mid to
high 80s on five to six liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.
Blood gas at the time revealed a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 35 and
pO2 of 41%.  Blood gas was repeated revealing similar numbers
and in looking back at his blood gasses from previous
admissions, this is his baseline pO2.

After mild diuresis and Albuterol, Atrovent nebulizers, his
O2 saturation increased to 91% on five liters which is his
baseline.  He was continued on his Combivent inhaler and
received Albuterol and Atrovent nebs p.r.n.  Upon admission
it was felt that perhaps he was having an acute flare of his
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and was given
Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department 100 mg.  He was
changed to p.o. Prednisone at 80 mg and then tapered which
will continue after discharge.

3.  HEMATOLOGY:  Patient's hematocrit on admission was 51.9
and felt likely to be due to chronic hypoxemia and
compensation for that.  After his cath, CBC was checked and
his blood level was stable.  Upon presentation to the
Emergency Department, he was started on a heparin drip.  This
was continued through the catheterization and then stopped
immediately afterwards.

4.  ENDOCRINE:  While on steroids for his chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation, the patient was covered with
an insulin sliding scale.  This will be discontinued once his
Prednisone taper is complete.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol 15 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Prednisone 40 mg on [**10-29**] mg on [**10-30**] and [**10-31**], 10
mg on [**11-1**] and [**2177-11-2**] then discontinue.
4.  Combivent MDI one to two puffs q. four hours p.r.n.
5.  Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q. four hours and q.
six ho
