Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 678**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Dialysis

History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year-old man with a history of DM II, CAD/CHF (EF
45%) and HD dependent ESRD who presents to the ED from dialysis
with fever, gait instablitiy, and altered mental status.
Pt was in dialysis today when he was noted to be more confused
than his baseline. He was also noted to have difficulty
ambulating with ? leg/knee pain. In ED, VS were 101.8 (rectal),
HR 11, BP 208/93, RR 22 O2 sat 97%. He was a+o x1. Pt appeared
confused but was protecting airway, following commands. He
denied abd pain, tenderness. Urinary catheter was noted to have
pus. The patient was given Given 1 L IVF, 2g ceftriaxone, 1g
vancomycin. CT head was obtained and was negative for acute
bleed. EKG was without change compared to previous. CXR
preliminary read showed volume overload. UA was postive for
>1000 WBC.
Of note, the patient was admitted in [**3-/2155**] with a similar
presentation of altered mental status and fever to 101 without
source.
Upon transfer to the ICU, the patient had no complaints. He was
oriented x2. He reported feeling well. He denies any recent
illness was well as abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of
breath, cough, urinary frequency, lightheadedness, focal
weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

[**12-16**] CT head
There is no hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, shift of
normally midline structure, or evidence of major vascular
territorial infarct.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
Hypodensities in the
periventricular and subcortical white matter reflect chronic
microvascular
ischemic change. Note is made of a prominent cleft vs. old left
cerebellar
infarct, unchanged. Incidental note is made of a cavum septum
pellucidum et
[**Last Name (LF) 26095**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] anatomic variant. The visualized paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air
cells remain normally aerated. The cavernous carotids are
calcified.

IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage.

[**12-16**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Patchy bilateral airspace opacities, which is likely
related to
fluid overload. Infection is not excluded. Repeat radiography
following
appropriate diuresis is recommended to assess underlying
infection.


[**12-17**] CXR
There is no interval change in perihilar vascular indistinct and
extensive
patchy opacities involving the entire lungs. This may represent
volume
overload although widespread infection in appropriate clinical
setting cannot
be excluded. The absence of pleural effusion somehow questions
the diagnosis
of pulmonary edema favoring infection but cannot absolutely
exclude it.
Cardiomegaly is present. Mediastinum is unremarkable.

[**12-18**] Renal US
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of renal obstruction. Equivocal non-obstructing
tiny stones
in the lower pole of the left kidney.

2. Abnormal appearance of the bladder, with thickened, irregular
wall.
Further evaluation with CT or MRI is recommended.

3. Bilateral atrophic kidneys may relate to prior infections or
chronic
medical renal disease.

[**12-18**] CT pelvis
IMPRESSION:

1. Bladder wall thickening is difficult to evaluate as the
bladder is
collapsed due to Foley catheter. If this is of clinical concern,
repeat
ultrasound after clamping of Foley catheter is recommended.
2. Enlarged gallbladder, but given asymptomatic nature, and lack
likely due
to fasting state.

3. Atrophic kidneys, as in the prior studies.

4. Bilateral atelectasis, but airspace opacification
(aspiration, early
infectious consolidation) cannot be excluded.
