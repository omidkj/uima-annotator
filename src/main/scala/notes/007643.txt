HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old female
with a past medical history of biventricular failure status
post AV pacer placement on [**2112-4-30**] and congestive heart
failure with an ejection fraction of 15% and chronic renal
insufficiency who awoke at 6 a.m. with 10/10 chest pain
radiating to her abdomen that gave her nausea and great
distress.  The patient presented to the Emergency Department
on [**5-23**] and was given sublingual nitrogen x3 with a
decrease in base to 5 from 10.  She received Lopressor,
aspirin and 2 liters oxygen by nasal cannula.  The patient's
pain was reproducible by palpation below the pacemaker
placement site and with deep inspiration.  The patient
experienced nausea and vomiting one time in the Emergency
Department for which she was given droperidol.  The patient
was checked for fingersticks and her glucose was 155.  The
patient vomited one more time in the Emergency Room and the
patient continued to report pain with deep inspiration.

II through XII grossly intact.

LABS UPON ADMISSION:  The patient had a white count of 10.6,
hematocrit of 31.9, platelets of 179.  Her MCV was 98.
Electrolytes:  She had a sodium of 136, potassium of 4.0,
chloride of 97, bicarbonate of 23, BUN of 115, creatinine of
2.2.  She had a digoxin level of 2.8, TSH of 6.0, free T4 of
1.0.  She had a CPK of 70 and a troponin less than 0.3.
Electrocardiogram was AV paced and she had T-wave changes in
V1 and V2.  Chest x-ray:  No evidence of congestive heart
failure or cardiomegaly and an echocardiogram from [**2111-1-23**]
showed an ejection fraction of 15%.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY DATES:  On [**5-24**], the patient ruled in
for a myocardial infarction by enzymes and she was sent to
the CCU for low blood pressure.  Swan placed and pressors
were started.  She was found to be in tamponade with
equalization of pressures.  On [**5-25**], pericardiocentesis was
attempted in the catheter lab, but patient coded.  It was [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] in the catheter lab and an emergent thoracotomy with
pericardial drainage was performed by CT surgery.  On [**5-25**],
after the emergent thoracotomy, the patient was transferred
to the SICU on pressors and on the vent.

On [**5-28**], the patient was progressing in the SICU, but
developed rapid atrial fibrillation, so she was transferred
to the CCU, started on amiodarone and the patient
spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm.  On [**5-30**], the
patient was extubated and creatinine gradually to trend up to
3.7 and that is high from 2.2 on admission.  On [**6-3**], the
patient was unable to get sufficient fluid off despite
Natrecor, Lasix and metolazone, so they tried to reduce
afterload with Hydril and Isordil.

On [**6-6**], her creatinine peaked at 4.2 and they had to back
off the Lasix due to renal failure.  Renal was consulted was
consulted at this time and the family wanted to proceed with
dialysis.  On [**6-8**], hemodialysis was started but the
patient's blood pressure could not tolerate such a procedure
and significant fluid was not removed.  On [**6-9**], renal had a
trial of CVVH to remove fluid and therefore CVVH was started.
On [**6-13**], CVVH was stopped after removing greater than 8
liters over the previous four days.  On [**6-14**], renal decided
to retry hemodialysis which was successful.  The patient
tolerated it well and one more liter of fluid was removed.

On [**6-15**], a right subclavian tunneled catheter was placed by
IR.  On [**6-16**], the patient was called out to the floor for
placement and all central lines were pulled except for the
hemodialysis tunneled catheter.  On [**6-17**], the patient had an
episode of blood loss from the site where a previous groin
line was pulled, but it resolved with pressure.  The patient
needed one unit of packed red blood cells.

On [**6-18**], the patient started to have significant bleeding from
the hemodialysis tunneled catheter site and the patient was
unable to go to the rehabilitation given this issue.  On [**6-19**],
pressure dressing was applied, but there was still lots of
oozing.  There was an episode of chest pain and the patient
was ruled out by enzymes.  On [**6-21**], IR reevaluated the site,
injected with thrombin and the site continued to ooze despite
this.

On [**6-22**], the patient had platelets of 99, INR of 1.7.  IR felt
this was why the catheter continued to bleed.  They stopped
Protonix and started to check labs for concern of a chronic
DIC picture.  The patient started to show a chronic DIC
picture on [**6-24**] with increased fibrin degradation products,
increased D-dimer, normal fibrinogen with normal PT/PTT and
decreased platelets in the setting of breathing around the
catheter site.  On [**6-24**], as well, the patient experienced
chest pain and was ruled in by enzymes with a troponin max of
9.4 and flat CKs.  The patient was started on oxygen and beta
blocker.

The patient could not tolerate aspirin at the time due to
oozing around the catheter site.  On [**6-25**], pressure was held
on the catheter site for 30 minutes and cryoglobulin,
platelets and a unit of red cells were transfused.  Bleeding
decreased.

Again later, another unit of cryoglobulin, packed red blood
cells and bag of platelets were transfused.  Bleeding around
the catheter site stopped on [**6-26**].  On [**6-27**], the patient
received hemodialysis and is ready for discharge to [**Hospital6 19682**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Patient stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Insulin 70/30 40 units in addition to a sliding scale
a.m.
2.  Amiodarone 200 once a day

7.  Epogen [**Numeric Identifier 961**] units 3x a week
8.  Nephrocaps 1 per day
9.  Aspirin 325 once per day since bleeding has resolved.
