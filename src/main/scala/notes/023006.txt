Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB and asymptomatic NSVT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2151-2-26**] ICD placement.


History of Present Illness:
57 F w/ hx CABG (emergent in [**2139**] w/ VG's to OM and LAD),
stenting of SVG to LAD in [**2141**] who presented [**1-13**] w/ acute
STEMI ([**Doctor First Name **] was SVG - LAD that was stented).  Her course was
complicated by severe cardiogenic shock requiring IABP and
triple pressors.  Her LCx was found to have successive 90%
stenosis proximally and distally that were unsuccessfully
attempted to be intervened on.  ECHO showed severe LV
dysfunction w/ 3+MR, extensive apical akinesis and mural
thrombus.  Over the course of 1 month, her pressors and IABP
were weaned and she eventually tolerated low dose ACE and BB.
EP was consulted for ICD placement and recommended future LV
systolic function reassessment.  She was discharged on
lisinopril 5mg, toprol XL 12.5mg, furosemide 40mg. She was
euvolemic at discharge. She was also discharged on coumadin for
mural thrombus. She was d/c'd to rehab.
.
At rehab, pt has been noting intermittent SSCP ~5min [**5-23**] X per
day.  She has also been noting increased SOB.  She has been
taking her meds and per pt, eating low sodium diet.  Today,
[**2151-2-21**], she was found to have 2 runs of 20 beats of NSVT
(assymptomatic).  She was sent to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, she was afebrile, HR 93, BP 96/48, 98%4LNC.  She was
given lasix 100mg IV and transferred to CCU for goal directed
therapy.


Past Medical History:
-[**Last Name (un) 24206**] [**Last Name (un) 24206**] syndrome
-CVA in [**2122**] and [**2132**] with mild dysphagia
-seizure disorder
-CAD s/p emergent CABG (SVG to LAD, SVG to OM) after failed PTCA
(attempted to LAD; LMCA occlusion) [**2139**]; stenting of SVG to LAD
in [**2141**]
-Aorto-bifemoral bypass
-GI bleed


Social History:
She worked as a secretary but hasn't for some time due to health
problems. Lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) **], daughter nearby. She had
been smoking 1 pack per week. Rare etoh.


Family History:
Father died of an MI at 78, mother healthy.

Physical Exam:
Vitals- HR 104, BP 125/65, AC 500x30/5/100%
General- NAD
HEENT- pupils dilated and fixed, ETT, OGT
Neck- R carotid pulse 1+, L carotid pulse diminished
Pulm- coarse breath sounds b/l
CV- tachycardic but regular,
Abd- +BS, soft, ND
Extrem- no LE edema, feet cool, slow cap refill
Neuro- sedated, spontaneously moving all 4 extremities,
?withdraws to nailbed pressure, RUE +3 DTRs, LUE/[**Name2 (NI) **]/LLE +2 DTRs



Pertinent Results:
EKG [**2151-2-21**]: 9bpm, sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Low
limb lead voltage. Prior anterior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-2-9**] the T waves are less
inverted in the anterolateral leads and ventricular [**Date Range 24207**] is
abasent. Otherwise, no diagnostic interval change.

CXR [**2151-2-21**]:
1.  Diffuse interstitial abnormality, which raises the
possibility of a more chronic process such as hemosiderosis
resulting from pulmonary edema. A PA and lateral study may be of
value.
2.  New small bilateral pleural effusion.

CXR [**2151-2-26**]:
A right chest wall single lead pacemaker/ defibrillator is in
appropriate position.  The proximal electrode is adjacent to the
SVC.  There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is upper
limits of normal, but stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours
are within normal limits.  The patient is status post sternotomy
and CABG.  A diffuse interstitial abnormality is unchanged since
multiple prior exams. There are no focal consolidations, and no
effusion.
IMPRESSION:  Status post right chest wall single lead
pacemaker/defibrillator without pneumothorax.

ECHO dyssynchrony  study:
LV systolic function appears depressed with apical and lateral
hypokinesis  (regional motion not fully assesed; focused views
only). Tissue synchronization imaging demonstrates significant
left ventricular dyssynchrony with the lateral wall contracting
105 ms later than the septum. The aortic pre-ejection time is
normal at 42 (nl <140ms). The delay between left ventricular and
right ventricular ejection is 14 (nl <40ms). The left ventricle
is dyssnchronous with global synchrony ([**Doctor Last Name **]) index of 52 ms (nl
<=33ms).

CXR [**2151-2-27**]:
There has been no interval change in the position of the
single-lead AICD.
Mediastinotomy wires are seen.  There is again noted prominence
of the
interstitial markings bilaterally.  Underlying pulmonary edema
cannot be
excluded, however, these findings are stable when compared to
multiple prior radiographs.  No pleural effusions are seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57 F w/ [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **], PVD, CAD s/p CABG ('[**39**]), massive STEMI
[**12-23**] c/b cardiogenic shock now w/ runs of ASx NSVT.
.
1.  Pump:
a. She has class 4 HF, EF 10-15%.  On admission, she appeared
mildly volume overloaded and responded well to diuretics.  Her
BP continued to run low sBP 70s-100s throughout the hospital
course likely secondary to her low ejection fraction although
she was mentating well.  Her ACEi dose was initially held but
restarted at a lower dose once her BP tolerated.  She was also
on digoxin and received Lasix as needed for volume overload.  A
dyssynchrony study was performed which showed left ventricular
dyssynchrony  with the lateral wall contracting 105 ms later
than the septum.  EP was contact[**Name (NI) **] given her low EF for
consideration for ICD placement. An AICD was placed without
complication.

b. Mural thrombus on previous TTE and severe apical akinesis.
Initially Coumadin was held because the INR was
supratherapeutic. Heparin IV was started to bridge INR in
preparation for ICD placement. Coumadin was restarted post
procedure.
.
2.  Ischemia:
CAD: Pt w/ CABG (VG's to LAD and OM in [**2139**]), PCI of OM-LAD '[**41**]
and PCI of acute MI (VG to LAD) [**12-23**].  She still has very tight
consecutive 90% lesions in prox and mid LCx w/ occluded VG-OM.
Cardiac enzymes were negative and EKG without changes.  She was
continued on aspirin, plavix, beta blocker, statin.  Her ACEi
was initially held but restarted at a lower dose once her BP
tolerated.
.
3.  Rhythm: She was mostly in normal sinus rhythm although she
had several asymptomatic runs of NSVT.  She was treated with
beta blockers.  Electrolytes were repleted as needed  An AICD
was placed without complication.  She will follow up with EP and
the device clinic.
.
4. Pressure ulcer: She has a coccyx pressure ulcer that was seen
by the wound nurses and appropriate wound care was administered.
 The patient was also encouraged to change positions every [**1-19**]
hours.
.
5. Nausea: The patient had an episode of nausea with emesis and
diarrhea.  She remained afebrile and no elevated WBC.  Stool
cultures were negative.  This was likely a brief episode of
viral gastroenteritis and
