Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female
with diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease with
chronic chest pain at home and a normal cardiac
catheterization in [**2163**] was at her regularly scheduled
[**Hospital 8183**] clinic appointment this morning when she
reportedly became diaphoretic and collapsed.  Per anesthesia,
the patient was blue without respirations or pulse.  CPR was
initiated.  EMS was called.  The patient was intubated with
spontaneous regeneration of pulse, sinus tachycardia with a
rate in the 120s.  Blood pressure was 220/110.  She was given
one amp of D50 and was transferred to the Emergency Room.

Upon arrival in the Emergency Department, patient's blood
pressure was 198/97.  Heart rate 118.  Respiratory rate 25.
Oxygen saturation 100% on 100% ETT tube.  Electrocardiogram
showed a new left bundle branch block.  Chest x-ray showed
diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities.  Head CT:  No acute
ICH, question of an old infarct.  Bedside echocardiogram
reported an ejection fraction of about 25%.  She was given
Lasix 40 intravenously, Ativan 10 mg and was placed on a
nitroglycerin drip, and an insulin drip and was given 2
liters of normal saline and was sent emergently to the
cardiac catheterization laboratory.

Catheterization laboratory pressures were mildly elevated.
Right atrial pressure 13, RV 38/7.  PA pressure 47/16.
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 15.  Cardiac output 5.1.
Index 2.9.  All coronaries were normal.  PA saturation 77%.
During the catheterization, the patient became hypotensive
with systolic blood pressure in the 70s, and she was started
on dopamine and transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes times ten years, poorly controlled.
2.  Coronary artery disease, question of myocardial
infarction in [**2163**], [**2164**] in [**Location (un) 4708**] per daughter.
3.  Angina, status post catheterization [**2163**] with an ejection
fraction of 40-45%, clean coronaries, anteroseptal
hypokinesis, status post echocardiogram in [**2163**], 1+ mitral
regurgitation, left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection
fraction 55%.
4.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
2.  Captopril 25 mg po t.i.d.
3.  Glucophage 1 gram po b.i.d.
4.  Glucotrol XL 10 mg po q.d.
5.  Isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg po t.i.d.
6.  Metoprolol 25 mg po b.i.d.
7.  Nitroglycerin prn.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with daughter.  [**Name (NI) 25122**] care of
grandchildren.

Electrocardiogram:  Sinus rhythm at 97 beats per minute, left
ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 18.4 with leukocytosis.
Hematocrit 49.0, platelet count 249,000.  Chemistries were
remarkable for a potassium of 3.3.  Cardiac enzymes:  CK 89,
troponin T less than 0.01.  Arterial blood gases:  At the
time of admission, 7.5, 130 and 110.  Toxicology screen was
negative.  Urinalysis just showed large glucose and moderate
blood.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral interstitial alveolar
opacities consistent with pulmonary edema.  ETT in place.
Persistent pulmonary edema, progressive, left lower lobe
atelectasis/consolidation on the second chest x-ray.  Head
CT:  No acute ICH.  Possible subacute or chronic infarct, 2
cm round partial lobe, chronic left cerebral periventricular
infarction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature currently 99.0.  Heart
rate 101.  Blood pressure 102/59 on dopamine 5 mg/kg/minute.
Respiratory rate 14.  Oxygen saturation 100%, vent setting
CMV 14 x 550.  FIO2 0.5, PEEP of 5.  In general, the patient
was intubated, sedated, obese.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Jugular
venous distention difficult to assess secondary to neck line.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no
murmurs.  Pulmonary:  Breath sounds equal bilateral, crackles
at base, no wheeze.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft, hypoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  Trace edema.  Neurological:  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light, face symmetric, moving
all four.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 65-year-old woman with poorly
controlled diabetes, hypertension and a history of angina
with essentially normal echocardiogram and catheterization in
[**2163**] who collapsed this morning at an Ophthalmology
appointment.  She was reportedly apneic and pulseless.  She
was intubated with spontaneous return of pulses.  No shocks
were given.  Echocardiogram in Emergency Department showed an
ejection fraction of 25%, clean coronaries on catheterization
and mildly elevated filling pressures and congestive heart
failure on chest x-ray.  Unclear etiology of arrest/pulmonary
edema versus arrhythmia versus primary respiratory versus
neurological cause.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  By problem:

1.  Cardiovascular:

1A.  Coronary artery disease:  Normal coronary arteries.  The
patient was continued on aspirin, Lipitor and Metoprolol
during her stay.

1B.  Pump:  Poor systolic function, ejection fraction of
15-20%.  Unlikely ischemic event given her normal coronaries.
Other laboratory tests including iron studies, TSH and RPR
were normal.  She did have an elevated sedimentation rate
possibly indicative of this stunned myocardium after her
arrest.  Other laboratory tests including HIV, HCV and [**Doctor First Name **]
are pending at the time of discharge and will have to be
followed up on as an outpatient.  The patient will have a
repeat echocardiogram in one month.  For now, continue her
beta-blocker and titrate up her ACE inhibitor as tolerated.

1C.  Rhythm:  The patient had a rate related left bundle
branch block.  She had EP mapping on [**3-17**], no
inducible VT.  She did have an ICD pacemaker placed on
[**2166-3-18**].  Patient will follow-up with
Electrophysiology after discharge for pacemaker check.  She
will complete a two day course of Keflex post ICD placement.

2.  Pulmonary:  Status post arrest and intubation, extubated
on [**3-13**].  Initially febrile with increased white blood
cell count.  She was started on Flagyl and levofloxacin
empirically.  Her urine legionella antigen was negative.
Sputum cultures grew gram positive cocci.  Blood cultures
were negative.  She was continued on a ten day course of
Flagyl and levofloxacin.

3.  Endocrine:  The patient was initially transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit on an insulin drip.  She was titrated off
her insulin drip.  Her metformin was discontinued secondary
to a poor ejection fraction.  She was continued on glipizide
and started on acarbose and was continued on a diabetic diet
after extubation.  She will need follow-up with her primary
care physician and endocrinologist for further management of
her diabetes.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Toprol XL 50 mg po q.d.
2.  Acarbose 25 mg po t.i.d.
3.  Lisinopril 20 mg po q.d.
4.  Glipizide XL 20 mg po q.d.
5.  Pantoprazole 40 mg po q.d.
6.  Atorvastatin 20 mg po q.d.
7.  Levofloxacin 500 mg po q.d. times two additional days.
8.  Flagyl 500 mg po t.i.d. for two additional days.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with her primary care
physician and cardiologist and will be seen in
Electrophysiology Clinic regarding her new pacemaker.
