STUDIES:
.
EKG: [**2184-7-14**] NSR, normal axis, likely V1 and V2 reversal, TWI in
V2, ? ST depr < 0.5mm in II and V5/6 - repeat EKG without these
changes. No change from prior EKG.
.
CXR [**2184-7-14**]:
Heart normal in size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
Pulmonary vascularity is normal, lungs are clear. No effusions
or pneumothorax. Multiple healed bilateral rib fractures are
demonstrated. Clips in the left axilla demonstrate prior lymph
node dissection. Overall, no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

.
[**2184-7-15**] CXR:
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Aside from low lung volumes, the
lungs are clear. The heart size, and mediastinal and hilar
contours are normal. The pleurae are normal. Clips in the left
axilla denote prior lymph node dissection. Multiple bilateral
healed rib fractures are present.
.
[**2184-7-15**] RUQ U/S:
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal liver. No evidence of bile duct dilatation.
2. Gallbladder polyp and possible tiny stones. No cholecystitis.

.
[**2184-7-16**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2184-6-15**], the
