Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 85 year old man with hx of CAD s/p MI and
CABG, biV-ICD, blindness, presents from [**Hospital1 100**] Senior Life after
developing chest pain and ICD shocks over the past week. The
history was obtained with the assistance of a Russian
translator.  The patient states that he first felt the shock
about a week ago.  Of note, per EMS, his potassium on the day
prior to admission was 2.8 and treated with 60 mEq of KCl.
According to the referred information from the [**Hospital1 100**] Senior
Life, a cardiology consult was requested on [**2146-8-1**] for
defibrillator charge.  Currently the patient feels well.  He has
no active chest pain or shortness of breath.  He has no abd pain
or dysuria.
.
Upon arrival to the ED his initial vital signs were 98 74 112/74
16 92%RA. He was noted to be in VT and was paced out of it.  A
second episode of VT was terminated with ICD discharge.  His
potassium was noted to be low and was repleted. He was bolused
with amiodarone and transfered to the CCU.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Transthoracic Echo [**2146-8-22**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by
transesophageal echocardiography). Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of nearly all
segments. The estimated cardiac index is depressed
(<2.0L/min/m2). No intraventricular thrombus is seen. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be quantified. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular cavity enlargement with
extensive regional systolic dysfunction and depressed cardiac
index c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process (LVEF 20%).
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is an 85 year old man with history of
ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p  CABG and [**Hospital1 **]-v ICD implantation
presenting for evaluation of ICD discharges.
.
Ventricular tachycardia:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 85 year old man with hx
of CAD s/p MI and CABG, biV-ICD, blindness, who presented from
[**Hospital1 100**] Senior Life after experiencing chest pain and ICD shocks
over the past week. After interrogating the pacer it was found
that the patient was having appropriate ICD ATP activity
followed by appropriate shocks since mid-[**Month (only) **].  According to the
rehab center, the patient had been experiencing diarrha which
was likely contributing to his electrolyte abnormalities
(hypokalemia).  The patient was ruled out for MI by negative
cardiac enzymes. The care team attempted to suppress VT to
prevent future shocks and initiated medical therapy first with
Amiodarone.  The patient continued to have episodes of
antitachycardial pacing with the ICD firing, and required two
additional doses of an amiodarone bolus of 150 mg in order to
control the rhythm.  He was monitored on telemetry to rule out
any additional dysrrhythmic episodes.  After day 1 of admission
the patient did not have any additional rhythm abnormalities
causing the ICD to fire. Pt will need to have potassium < 4 and
magnesium < 2 repleted to prevent dysrrhythmia.  Baseline TFTs
were nl, LFTs were significant for elevated total bilirubin, and
full PFTs will be checked within 1-2 weeks at Rehab.
.
CAD:  The patient was continued on aspirin, a statin, and a
beta-blocker for their cardioprotective effects and had no
evidence of pump failure on exam.  The patient was started on a
low-dose ACE-I for systolic heart failure (EF 20%) on echo with
the added benefit of potassium retention.  The patient was also
continued on lasix and spironolactone, the latter for its
potassium-sparing effects.  His potassium and renal function on
his new medication regimen will be followed over the next 8
days.
.
Anxiety: The patient appears markedly anxious about being in the
hospital likely due to the language barrier, hearing
impairments, and visual impairments. His home doses of
psychotropic medications (ativan/effexor) were continued and
frequent telephone calls were made to facilitate Russian
interpretation.  His family was also [**Name (NI) 653**], but unable to
visit the hospital as they were out of town.
.
Hyperbilirubinemia: LFTs were drawn to evaluate for amiodarone
toxicity.  Total bili was elevated at 3.8 with no prior labs
available for comparison.  Fractionated bilis were pending on
discharge.  All other labs were wnl and patient without
abdominal pain.  Patient will have LFTs redrawn on [**8-25**]; to be
followed up by [**Hospital 100**] Rehab physician.
