Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia/Hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
83F history of CAD CHF presenting from a nursing facility with
hypoxia to the 70s. She is baseline dementia and is not
complaining of any pain. She is alert and oriented to self only
but will answer questions.

Overall, history is unclear, since patient is unable to provide
detailed history. Per ED, she was sent from a nursing facility
with hypoxia into 70s.

Her nephew reports that about a week ago she was at [**Hospital 26260**]
hospital with some "discomfort", unclear exactly what it was,
however. He reported that she was going to undergo a cardiac
catherization, but this did not happen for some reason. Since
then she has been living at [**Doctor First Name 4233**] house by herself and not
having any major concerns. She did have a cough that he noted
today only, but not clear how long that this has been going on.

In the ED, initial vs were:  Temp of 101.4, Tachycardic into
120s, blood pressure in 80s, a central line was placed into her
groin, given that she was not cooperative with other access
sites, and she was started on norepinephrine for blood pressure
support after getting 2Liters of NS IV. UA was notable for Hazy
urine, with neg Leuk, WBC 10, few Bact, No epis, and negative
for Nitrites. Labs were notable for WBC 18.6, with 82%Neuts, 1
band, 10Lymphs. Troponin <0.01. An EKG showed sinus tachycardia
at HR of 120, QTc of 456, Normal Axis. No concerning ST changes.
Urine culture was sent off. Patient was given Vancomycin, Zosyn

Past Medical History:

1. No evidence of acute aortic syndrome or acute pulmonary
embolus.
2. Soft tissue density nodal mass surrounding the right lower
lobe bronchus and [**Last Name (LF) 56207**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be infectious in nature or may
represent a neoplasm. Right lower lobe consolidation is present,
which may represent post-obstructive changes, infection in the
appropriate clinical setting or aspiration.
3. Markedely enlarged thryoid gland with multple hypodense
lesions, consider thyroid unltrasound exam for further
assessment.
4. Prominent centrilobular emphysema involving primarily upper
lobes.
5. A 6-mm endobronchial lesion at the left main bronchus, may
represent an
endobronchial neoplasm, hamartoma and small mucous nodele.
6. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Gallbladder is
distended without gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic
fluid collection.
7. Left renal cysts.



Brief Hospital Course:
83F history of CAD CHF presenting from a nursing facility with
hypoxia to the 70s, hypotension, fever of 101.4, and
leukocytosis. Initially admitted to the MICU, started on empiric
treatment for HCAP and COPD exacerbation. She showed some signs
of improvement at times throughout her course, but experienced
numerous setbacks, including intermittent tachycardia,
hypotension, guaic positive stool concerning for an acute GI
bleed, and acute encephalopathy.  She then had profound
respiratory decompensation on [**2111-12-7**].  This resulted in a
shift in the focus of care to comfort-centered care.  She passed
away peacefully at 04:26 am on [**2111-12-9**].  Please [**Last Name 788**] problem
summaries below for further details on the antecedent causes of
her death.

# Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure:  found around 11 AM on
[**12-7**] to be unresponsive to sternal rub or nailbed pressure.
She was tachypneic, but actually less so than her baseline, and
O2 sats were also baseline.  ABG obtained showing pH 7.03, pCO2
138.  Started on BiPAP briefly while we contact[**Name (NI) **] her nephew
[**Name (NI) **], who decided upon arrival to change her care to comfort
measures only (CMO).  In terms of the etiology of her
decompensation, this is still not entirely clear.  The family
has granted an autopsy, which may help provide some information.

# Pneumonia: Presented with new infiltrates on CXR and CT chest,
consistent with possible post-obstructive type pneumonia in RLL
due to RLL bronchus mass vs. HAP/HCAP. She was started initially
on Vancomycin and Pip/Tazo in the ED, added azithromycin in MICU
for atypical coverage.  Urine legionella negative. Infiltrates
improved on CXR and CT chest, however she is still required O2
and was perstently tachypneic. Switched to linezolid [**12-1**] from
vanco, given ?VRE UTI and persistently low vanco troughs.  She
was on day 13 of antibiotics when she decompensated (see above).

# Severe COPD exacerbation:  Respiratory status worsened by
presumed COPD exacerbation, which left her quite wheezy, "tight"
and tachypneic nearly all the time.  She was started on steroids
at 40 mg qday, which we began to taper after 5 days.  She was
also given nebulizers around the clock and continued on her
advair.

# Lung mass: soft tissue mass suspicious for lung CA seen on CT
on admission here. Obtained records from [**Location (un) 1121**] with CT
read-- can see the mass encasing the RLL bronchus and the
endobronchial lesion in left bronchus.  Repeated non-contrast
chest CT done [**12-1**], no significant changes to the mass or the
degree of bronchus constriction.  Her family was originally
interested in pursuing a diagnosis on this mass, but it was felt
that a biopsy would not be worth the risk during her acute
illness, especially given that she was on plavix for a recent
medically-managemed NSTEMI.  Futher work up was deferred, but
knowledge of this lesion helped play a role in the family's
decision to ultimately make her CMO.
