History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year old woman with history of mitral valve
insufficiency followed by serial echocardiograms. Her most
recent echo in comparison to her echo 1 year prior revealed
severe MR with evidence of pulmonary vein reversal. Given the
progression of her mitral regurgitation, she was referred for
cardiac surgical evaluation. She denies any cardiac symptoms

climbing two flights of stairs. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted for
surgical intervention.

Pertinent Results:
[**2107-8-2**] Intraop TEE:
Prebypass: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results on [**2107-8-2**] at 1300.
Prebypass study performed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 929**].

Post bypass: Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an
infusion of phenylephrine. Biventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed. LVEF 45%. Very poor mid esophageal views. Well
seated annuloplasty ring seen in the mitral position. There is
trivial mitral reguritation. There is no [**Male First Name (un) **]. Mean gradient
across the mitral valve is 4 mm Hg. Aorta is intact post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**8-2**] Mrs. [**Known lastname 1024**] was taken to the operating room  and underwent
mitral valve repair (#28mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] saddle ring) with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
Cross clamp time=45 minutes. Cardiopulmonary Bypass time= 60
minutes. Please refer to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] operative report for
further surgical details. She tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the CVICU in stable but critical condition.
Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without difficulty.All lines and drains were
discontinued in a timely fashion. Beta-blocker, aspirin, statin
and diuresis was initiated. She continued to progress and was
transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring on
postoperative day one. Physical therapy was consulted for
evaluation and treatment. The remainder of her postoperative
course was essentially uneventful. She continued to progress and
was cleared for discharge to home by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] on POD# 4. All
follow up appointments were advised.
