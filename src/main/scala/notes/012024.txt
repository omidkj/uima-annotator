recurrent fevers and myalgias. He presented on [**5-4**] with similar
symptoms and was discharged on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for
endocarditis.  Blood cultures at that time grew Strep anginosus

hours. Blood cultures, U/A and head CT were done. Vitals upon
transfer were T99.3/HR 83, BP 110/67, RR 18, SpO2 98% on RA

IMAGING/STUDIES
ECG: Probable atrial fibrillation with controlled response.
Vertical axis. Intraventricular conduction delay. ST-T wave
abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2172-6-4**] the axis is
more right inferior. ST-T wave abnormalities are less prominent.

CT head w/o contrast
Evaluation is slightly limited given patient motion. However, no
evidence of acute intracranial process.

TTE: EF 25-30%. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2172-5-6**], the severity of mitral and aortic regurgitation
have increased. Estimated p
