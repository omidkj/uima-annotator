Service:  MEDICINE-[**Doctor Last Name 1181**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 year old male with
transitional cell metastatic carcinoma of the left kidney
receiving chemotherapy, diverticulosis and asthma, who
presented with black stools.  The patient states that four
days ago he was bearing down secondary to constipation and
had some dark black stools.  This continued to go on for one
to two times per day for three days.  He had positive nausea
when standing which was associated with some dizziness. He
denies any hematemesis, denies any abdominal pain.  He still
managed to have a good appetite.

Early the morning of admission, the patient experienced one
episode of chest pressure for several minutes with some
shortness of breath that then resolved on its own.  The pain
itself is not associated with nausea, vomiting or
diaphoresis.  The pressure did not radiate.  He has had no
similar episodes of chest pain in the past.

Of note, the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy,
colonoscopy in [**2183-5-21**], for workup of melanotic stools that
demonstrated prior peptic ulcer disease, diverticulosis of
the sigmoid colon and polyps in the rectum and hepatic
flexure.  The gastrointestinal workup was after two cycles of
Gemcitabine and Cisplatin which were stopped for the
gastrointestinal evaluation.  The patient was started on
cycle number three of his chemotherapy prior to admission.
The patient has had a history of peptic ulcer disease and
upper gastrointestinal bleed with hematemesis fifteen years
ago.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was given
nasogastric lavage which was negative for blood or bile and
received two units of packed red blood cells and 40 meq of
Potassium Chloride before transfer to the floor in stable
condition.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Transitional cell carcinoma of the left kidney, most
likely metastasis to the left periaortic and aortocaval
nodes.  Status post a left nephrectomy [**2183-1-21**], on cycle
number three of his chemotherapy.
2.  Asthma with p.r.n. inhalers at home.
3.  Gout and on Colchicine and Allopurinol at home.
4.  Occult gastrointestinal bleed [**2183-5-21**], status post
esophagogastroduodenoscopy [**2183-6-7**], and colonoscopy
[**2183-6-17**].  The patient has a history of diverticulosis and
colonic polyps with adenoma at hepatic flexure, hyperplastic
rectal polyp with biopsy negative.
5.  History of peptic ulcer disease fifteen years ago.
6.  Superficial bladder cancer, status post BCG treatments
[**2182-10-21**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has positive tobacco history for
greater than fifty years.  He drinks wine with his
medications, about two glasses per day.  He lives with his
wife and has two children.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died at age of 96 and father died
with an accidental death.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Allopurinol.
2.  Colchicine.
3.  P.r.n. Albuterol.
4.  The patient is not on Aspirin nor Coumadin therapy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, temperature
is 99.3, heart rate 94, blood pressure 134/47, respiratory
rate 25, and oxygen saturation 99% in room air.  Generally,
the patient is pleasant and in no acute distress.  Head and
neck examination - pale sclera.  Left eye with pterygium.
The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Cranial
nerves II through XII are grossly intact.  Jugular venous
pressure to midneck.  The neck is supple, positive
lymphadenopathy in the submandibular glands, 2+ carotid pulse
bilaterally, no bruits.  Cardiac examination - regular rate
and rhythm, II/IV crescendo decrescendo midpeaking murmur at
the right upper sternal border radiating to the carotids and
a II/IV holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla with
laterally displaced point of maximal impulse.  Pulmonary
examination - bilaterally expiratory wheezes with no
crackles.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds, no bruits, well healed midline
surgical scars.  Extremities - feet warm to touch, palpable
pedal pulses with no edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
2.9, hematocrit 13.0 and platelets 51,000, MCV 94.  Sodium
140, potassium 3.2, chloride 107, bicarbonate 23, blood urea
nitrogen 38, creatinine 1.1 and glucose 141.  Complete blood
count differential 31 neutrophils, 3 bands, 53 lymphocytes.

Prior studies on [**2183-6-10**], esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed
a normal esophagus and normal duodenum.  The pylorus
suggested prior peptic ulcer disease.  The colonoscopy dated
on [**2183-6-17**], showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid, polyps in
the rectum and polyps in the hepatic flexure.  He had grade
II internal hemorrhoids.

Electrocardiogram done on [**2183-7-13**], showed normal sinus
rhythm, 95 beats per minute, normal axis and normal
intervals.  No ST elevation, 2.[**Street Address(2) 2811**] depression in
V3 through V6.  Left ventricular hypertroph.  Flattened T
wave in lead I.

Chest x-ray on [**2183-7-13**], showed no infiltrates and no heart
failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was given an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy to find the source
of possible gastrointestinal bleed.  The most likely cause
was a bleeding arteriovenous malformation that was between
the second and third portion of the duodenum.   He was
transfused a total of seven units with his hematocrit
stabilizing in the low 30s.

There was no further evidence of active bleeding.  His stools
were turning brown.  CT of the abdomen was reported as
negative for metastatic disease.  The patient had another
episode of chest pain on [**2183-7-14**], with no associated
symptoms.  The vital signs were unchanged.  The chest pain
was described as substernal and did not radiate and lasted
for a few minutes.

Electrocardiogram at that time showed normal sinus rhythm at
90 beats per minute, normal intervals, normal axis, V4 to V6
with normalization of ST as compared to admission
electrocardiogram which showed 2.[**Street Address(2) 2811**] depression
in V1 to V6; otherwise was unchanged.

The patient then had a second episode of chest pain overnight
on [**2183-7-15**], and again with no changes.  His cardiac panel at
that time showed a CK of 97, followed by 132, 128, CK MB 12
and then 10, CK MB index 9.1 and then 7.8 and troponin of
15.0 and 15.8.  The patient was considered to have ruled in
for myocardial infarction.

An echocardiogram was done which showed the left atrium
mildly dilated with left ventricular cavity normal.  Overall
left ventricular function was mildly depressed with posterior
hypokinesis.  The aortic valve was mildly thickened, mitral
valve was moderately thickened, severe 4+ mitral
regurgitation, mild pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension.

The patient's cardiac ischemia was thought to be most likely
due to demand ischemia secondary to a profoundly low
hematocrit of 13.0 upon presentation.  The patient was placed
on Lopressor and Lisinopril.  Aspirin was held in view of the
gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient had thrombocytopenia with platelets on
presentation of 51,000.  This was thought to be secondary to
his chemotherapy and also to his bleeding and climbed nicely
during his hospital stay.

The patient's asthma was stable throughout his hospital stay
on Albuterol as needed and Atrovent as needed for his
wheezing

On [**2183-7-16**], the patient was considered stable for transfer
to the medicine floor.  During this point, his hematocrit was
30.8, platelets were 151,000.  The patient had no further
gastrointestinal events and no further cardiac events and was
ready for discharge, however, the patient then spiked a
temperature and was found to be neutropenic with white blood
cell count of 1.1 and absolute neutrophil count of 350.  An
erythematous right arm was noted and his right intravenous
line was removed.

The patient also had some crackles on the left lower base
during lung examination and was given a chest x-ray which
showed left lower lobe consolidation possibly consistent
