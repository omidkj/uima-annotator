[**2138-10-22**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
CC:[**0-0-**]
HPI: This is a 68-year-old former Merchant Marine who suffered
an AMI while at sea back in [**2120**].  He was hospitalized in Lima,
[**Location (un) **] for approximately 20 days.  When he was discharged but he
experienced recurrent angina he describes as a terrible
heaviness in his chest.  He returned to the area and underwent
cardiac catheterization here at [**Hospital1 18**] where he had a PTCA of the
LCx and OM-1 in [**2121-2-27**].  He returned sea and while in
[**Country 5881**] he again developed angina in [**2121-6-29**].  He was flown
home and underwent repeat balloon angioplasty of the LCx and
OM-1 here at [**Hospital1 18**].  He has done well since and has been
medically managed until approximately five months ago when he
developed an increase in his tinnitus and vertigo which was
worse than his usual discomfort.  He saw his PCP who noticed he
had an irregular and increased heart beat and an increase in his
blood pressure.  He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in cardiac consultation
complaining of episodes of chest heaviness with exertion,
feeling tired, as well as feeling very poorly.  He has had his
medications adjusted several times over the last few months
without any improvement and is now
referred for a cardiac catheterization.  In addition he reports
episodes of shortness of breath when lying down.

He underwent a nuclear stress echo on [**2138-6-2**] where he exercised
10 minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol to a peak heart rate of 138 bpm
representing 91% of his age predicted maximum heart rate.  He
was found to have ST-T abnormalities at rest.  He had 1.[**Street Address(2) 93151**]
depression in lead III during recovery phase.  He had occasional
couplets and was found to have inferior-apical dyskinesis,
inferobasal and septal hypokinesis.  He had a mild reduction in
systolic function.  He was reported as having multiple wall
motion abnormalities consistent with an old MI and multivessel
CAD.LVEF was 45-55% and he had trace MR, TR PPR and mild
thickening of the aortic valve but no AR.

[**2138-10-22**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrated a moderately calcified LMCA with an eccentric
proximal-mid
50% stenosis. The LAD was a heavily calcified "twin" system with
a
70-80% stenosis of the septal twin just after bifurcation of a
major
diagonal; the diagonal had 70% proximal and 80% mid-branch
stenosis. The
LCX as moderately calcifed with a complex mid-AV groove-segment
stenosis
of 80% involvine the origin of an OM; there was mild diffuse
disease in
the LPL and LPDA. The RCA was nondominant and moderately
calcified;
there were proximal 60% and mid 80% stenoses with diffuse distal

disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated LV
filling
pressures.
3. Left ventriculography showed moderate LV systolic dysfunction
with
inferobasal akinesis and hypokinesis in other visualized
segments. The
aortic knob was calcified.

[**2138-10-22**] ECHO
Prebypass

1.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with moderate hypokinesia of the mid and apical
portions of the inferior wall , inferolateral wall and inferior
septum. . Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %).
3. There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the
right ventricle.
4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Post Bypass

1. Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine and epinephrine.
2. Biventricular systolic function is slightly improved.
3. Aorta intact post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2138-10-22**] for a
cardiac catheterization. He was found to have severe left main
and three vessel disease. Please see cath note for details. As
he continued to have chest discomfort, the cardiac surgical
service was consulted for surgical management. He was taken
urgently to the operating room given his unstable angina where
he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels.
Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively he was
taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. Within 24 hours, he had awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated. Aspirin, a statin and beta blockade were
resumed. Later on postoperative day one, he was transferred to
the step down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed
towards his preoperative weight. The physical therapy service
was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. He did well postoperatively, he had no preopblems with
atrial arrhtyhmias and was easily diuresed. He was ready for
discharge home on POD #5.
