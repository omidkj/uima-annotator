Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachypnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 47 yo F with a history of left upper arm DVT with
history of recent flying who presented to the ED with complaints
of sudden worsening of tachypnea over a baseline tachypnea over
the past 3 months. The patient has a history of left upper
extremity DVT about 1 year ago in the setting of bunionectomy in
the site of her peripheral line. She was sent home on a lovenox
bridge to coumadin, which she remained on for 6 months. She
reports that she flies every week for work, her last flight was
last week. That being said, she first noticed mild dyspnea on
exertion about 3 months ago, specifically when she went to work
out (she used to be able to run 3 miles without stopping and was
unable to do this [**2-8**] SOB) and that this has been worsening
slowly but progressively until last week. This past weekend, the
DOE became suddenly and acutely worse, which prompted her to
come in for evaluation. She notes that several months ago she
had some cramping in her right calf, very similar to the pain in
her left arm when she had her DVT, but this resolved in about 1
week and she didn't think anything of it. She denies
edema/erythema/cord.
.
In the ED, she underwent a CTA which was notable for multiple
bilateral PE's and CT evidence of RV strain. She remained
hemodynamically stable throughout with pressures in the 130's,
but tachycardic to the 110's. She was satting 92-93% on RA on
arrival which improved to 99% on 2L by NC. She was started on a
heparin gtt and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring
given that she is high risk for hemodynamic instability.

Pertinent Results:
CTA Chest on [**2172-7-27**]

IMPRESSION:
Massive pulmonary embolism with a large clot burden within left
and right main pulmonary arteries and their respective branches.
CT evidence of right heart strain and pulmonary arterial
hypertension as described.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 63317**] at the time of
preliminary review, and findings were flagged as urgent on the
ED dashboard.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


Echocardiogram on [**2172-7-28**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The
right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free
wall contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
ascending aorta is mildlydilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

IMPRESSION: dilated, hypocontractile right ventricle; small,
hyperdynamic left ventricle; severe pulmonary hypertension;
findings consistent with acute-on-chronic pulmonary
vaso-occlusive disease
.
U/S: Chronic nonobstructive clot of the right popliteal vein
with no
extension into the upstream venous system. Known left cephalic
venous clot with no extension to the upstream venous system.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to ICU due to tachypnea and concern for
impending hemodynamic compromise given evidence of evidence of
severe right heart strain and dilatation on CT angiography of
the chest. Etiology of PE unclear, and will need further workup
as outpatient.  Patient was started on heparin drip and
monitored, with improvement in her oxygenation.  She had been on
oral contraceptives in the past and was told never to take these
again.  Patient had an echocardiogram as detailed above which
showed right heart dilatation and hypokinesis. She was
transitioned to Lovenox with the initiation of coumadin. Her INR
will be checked on Friday, and she will continue on her Lovenox
until her INR is between 2.0 and 3.0. She will likely need
lifelong anticoagulation.

She was also noted to have a popliteal DVT and an upper
extremity DVT. She was scheduled for follow up in hematology,
and with a new PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 648**]. Her blood pressure was noted to
be elevated to the 140s/100s on day of discharge, and she was
asymptomatic. She will need to have this rechecked at her PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 648**].
