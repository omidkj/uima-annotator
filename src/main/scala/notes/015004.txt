ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Esophageal perforation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a delightful 67-
year-old woman with multiple medical problems who is severely
obese who for the past month prior to admission has been
developing some dysphagia. She reported two prior episodes
where she had to induce vomiting to clear food that was stuck
in her esophagus. She reports no weight loss over that period
of time. She had no prior endoscopies.

Earlier in the day on [**2114-3-12**], after eating lunch, she had
some food stuck in her distal esophagus causing her to induce
vomiting to clear it. After this, she subsequently developed
severe chest pain and abdominal pain. She presented to the
local Emergency Room and was transferred with the diagnosis
of a ruptured esophagus. Her imaging studies included a chest
x-ray, which showed free air in the diaphragm and a chest CT
scan, which showed air within the abdominal cavity and air
extending up within the mediastinum, as well as a
Gastrografin swallow, which showed a leak at the
gastroesophageal junction at the level of the diaphragm.

At the time of presentation to the Emergency Room at [**Hospital6 1760**], her heart rate was 150, her
blood pressure was well maintained at 100/50.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was rushed to the Operating Room and
placed under general anesthesia where she lost her blood
pressure. Of note, she was resuscitated simultaneously. With
resuscitation and Phenylephrine, her blood pressure returned
to approximately 100/50. Her heart rate dropped into the 110s
with hydration. Again, she was placed under general
endotracheal anesthesia with a double-lumen endotracheal
tube, and the operation was commenced. She underwent a left
thoracoabdominal incision with repair of her perforated
esophagus and an omental flap. She also had a drainage
gastrostomy tube placed and a feeding jejunostomy tube.
Flexible bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy were also performed.
She had her abdominal cavity irrigated after the drainage of
a large amount of pus and food stuff. She tolerated the
procedure well and was maintained in the Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively.

She had a relatively routine postoperative course for such a
devastating event in a debilitated patient. It was prolonged,
but not unexpected. She ultimately required a tracheostomy
tube and eventually was discharged to a rehabilitation on
[**2114-4-19**] with the tracheostomy tube in place and weaning
off the ventilator.
