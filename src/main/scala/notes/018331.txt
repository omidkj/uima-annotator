[**2169-4-9**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
1. Nodular opacities in the left lower lung with additional
small
ground-glass opacities bilaterally may represent infection.
Chest CT
recommended for further assessment given infectious symptoms.
2. Abdominal wall varices of indeterminate etiology.
3. Splenomegaly.
4. Coronary artery calcification
.
[**2169-4-9**] CT chest without contrast:
1. Left upper lung parenchymal consolidation likely pneumonia.
2. Multiple ground-glass and mixed solid and ground-glass
opacities in
bilateral lungs may be infectious in etiology although the
differential
includes neoplasm. A short-term (<3 month) repeat chest CT
should be
performed post-treatment to document resolution.
2. Extensive coronary artery calcifications
3. Mediastinal lymph nodes may be reactive.
4. Right subpectoral node. Recommend correlation with mammogram.

5. Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive
atelectasis.
6. Chest wall collateral vessels. Coarse calcification in the
SVC could
relate to chronic thrombus.


Brief Hospital Course:
43 yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD MWF, thyroid cancer, GERD and HTN,
admitted with gram negative sepsis and acute leukemia, found to
have AML.  Hospital Course complicated by Tumor Lysis Syndrome,
Febrile Neutropenia with Enterobacter Bacteremia, mucositis,
delirium, agitation.  With the patient clearly declining despite
best efforts at recovery, the patient was made CMO by her
healthcare proxy.  The patient expired on [**2169-4-21**].

#Acute myeloid leukemia:  Patient with rapidly rising WBC count
on admission despite therapy with hydrea.  She underwent CT
chest that showed hilar and pretracheal lymphadenopathy, likely
consistent with leukemia, although possibly related to
infection.  Labs consistent with early tumor lysis syndrome.
The patient was started on daily dialysis for tumor lysis
syndrome.  Given tumor lysis syndrome prior to initiation of
chemotherapy, she was transferred to the ICU for leukophoresis
to decrease WBC count burden prior to initiating chemotherapy.
WBC count decreased from 78 to 28 with leukophoresis, and the
patient became more awake with decreased peripheral cyanosis.
She was initiated on 7+3 and was transitioned back to the BMT
floor.  On the floor, she completed 7+3, the patient's course
was complicated by gram negative bacteremia, mucositis and
delirium and agitation. S/p chemotherapeutic regimen, patient
still had a significant number of blasts in peripheral blood,
signifying a very poor prognosis.

# Mucositis: significant mucositis, requiring patient to be NPO,
placed on TPN, and oral medications to be switched to IV
medications.  Also with e/o stridor, likely from mucosal
sloughing, crusting and bleeding.  ENT consulted on pt and did
endoscopy of pharynx, confirming structural defect.  Dilaudid
PCA was initiated for symptomatic relief.

# Agitation / delirium: On approximately hospital day #12,
patient had significant agitation and delirium, likely secondary
to difficulty in achieving equilibrium with new IV medications,
in the setting of severe mucositis.  The patient was treated
with dilaudid, clonazepam and ativan.

#Neutropenic fever: Patient febrile on admission to 101.7.  On
admission, she was found to have gram negative bacteremia with
enterobacter cloacae.  She also had ground glass opacities on
CT.  Patient with hypoxia and mild hypotension (to SBP 92 from
130s), concerning for developing sepsis.  She was placed on
vancomycin and meropenem on admission.  She was then broadened
to posaconazole to cover for possible pulmonary fungal
infection.  She underwent bronchoscopy with BAL to further
evaluate her ground glass opacities. 4 days into admission, the
patient developed a firey-erythematous blanching rash on her
back, that spread to cover her trunk and proximal thighs.
Antibiotics were changed to daptomycin, aztreonam, and ambisome
out of concern for drug rash.  The rash gradually improved.

#ESRD on HD MWF:  Followed by renal throughout admission.
Patient with chronic left arm fistula, on coumadin at home for
fistula thrombosis prevention - this was discontinued on
admission for impending chemotheraphy-related coagulopathy.  On
admission, the patient was dialyzed on her regular MWF schedule.
 With increasing tumor burden, she experienced tumo
