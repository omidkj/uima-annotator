Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the Trauma surgery/[**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery
Service and taken to the Operating Room for the above procedure.
 Refer to the dictated operative note for further details.  The
surgery was complicated by snapping of the lumbar drain in
epidural space with no consequences. The patient was transferred
to the SICU in a stable condition.  TEDs/pnemoboots were used
for postoperative DVT prophylaxis.  Intravenous antibiotics were
continued for 4 post op days while the lumbar drain was in.
Initial postop pain was controlled with a IV pain meds.  Diet
was advanced as tolerated through the PEG tube.    Physical
therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB to chair. Patient was
kept on ventilatory support for 5 days post op and then a
tracheostomy  was done and PEG tube was inserted. Notably the
patient failed extubation, requiring re-intubation on [**10-6**] for
what was suspected to be a L lung infiltrate and poor cough; the
intubation was fiber-optic and there were notably thick
secretions.  ICU course was otherwise unremarkable with the
exception of an initial ileus/functional obstruction.  On the
day of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital
signs, tolerating tube feeds and accepted to a ventilatory
rehabilitation institution.
