Admission Date:  [**2144-10-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-11-6**]

Date of Birth:  [**2113-8-27**]             Sex:   F

Service: ORTHOPAEDICS

Allergies:
Morphine / Codeine / Rifampin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14197**]
Chief Complaint:
Infected knee prothesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**10-26**]-Explantation tibial component L knee arthroplasty,
explantation antibiotic spacer, L prixmal femur debridement,
Irrigation and debridment of L lower extremity

[**10-29**]-Complex open reduction internal
fixation of left pathologic subtrochanteric periprosthetic
femur fracture.


History of Present Illness:
 31F with h/o osteosarcoma of femur as a teenager, s/p resection
and mult surgeries, c/b infection, who underwent a 8 hour
operation to remove her of femoral antibiotic spacer and the
tibial component of previous endoprosthesis, and place a of new
femoral and tibial antibiotic spacer.
Operative course: EBL = 1.5-2 L. Required Neo intraop to
maintain her BP. Transfused 2 units PRBC's and 6L crystalloid.
Post op: Continued to have borderline BP in PACU post op (SBP
60-80, with MAP in 50's), therefore, neo was restarted with
increase in MAP to 60s. HR was tachy in 100s-110s. Extubated
without complication, quickly weaned to room air. Transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring and evaluation of hypotension.
.
Regarding her osteosarcoma: Tumor initially removed and replaced
with prosthesis at age 13; this eventually failed. In [**Month (only) 404**]
[**2143**] she underwent replacement; complicated by coag-neg staph
infection of her distal femur. Treated through this infection
with 10 weeks with vanco and started on minocycline suppression.
She developed recurrent infection 6 weeks after stopping therapy
with coag-neg staph. Her prosthesis was removed at that time
with washout and placement of vanco-impregnanted cement,
followed by 8 weeks of vanco.
One week after stopping abx (approx 2 weeks PTA) she had
recurrent pain with elevated ESR and CRP; aspiration showed 4000
WBC with poly predominance, cultures grew coag-neg staph. She
was restarted on Vanco at that time. She was brought to the OR
on the day of admission for removal of the remainder of the
prosthesis, vanco cement, and for placement of spacer
impregnated with tobra (per ID).

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? alignment
LEFT FEMUR AND LEFT LOWER LEG, FOUR VIEWS

HISTORY: Post-operative day 1 status post resection and spacer
placement.

FINDINGS: Extensive post-operative changes of the left lower
extremity are seen. There has been removal distal femoral
allograft and placement of a methylmethacrylate spacer as well
as removal of the tibial component of a constrained total knee
prosthesis and placement of a methylmethacrylate spacer
replacing the proximal articular surface of the tibia. The
intramedullary rod within the proximal tibial shaft is still
present. Two cerclage wires are seen in this region. No
immediate complication is noted following surgery. Soft tissue
drains and skin staples are seen.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT

Reason: Thrombus of left upper extremity.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
31 year old woman s/p removal of hardware from femur, found to
have PE, LUE swelling.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Thrombus of left upper extremity.
CLINICAL HISTORY: 31-year-old female status post removal of
hardware from femur, found to have questionable PE. Evaluate for
left upper extremity thrombus.

LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler
son[**Name (NI) **] of the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary,
brachial, cephalic and basilic veins are performed. Normal
waveform, compressibility, augmentation, and flow is
demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus is identified. Note is
made of a PIC catheter coursing from the basilic vein into the
subclavian vein.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of left upper extremity DVT.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-

Reason: CTA-- assess for PE
Field of view: 32 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
31 year old woman with 31 year old woman s/p major orthopedic
surgery today, and several major recent ortho surgeries, now
hypotensive post op. Has L arm pain/edema, has chronic PICC in L
arm.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
CTA-- assess for PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 31-year-old female status post several major
recent orthopedic surgeries, now with hypertensive postop.
Patient with left arm pain and edema. Evaluate for pulmonary
embolus.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced MDCT acquired axial images of the
chest from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen. Multiplanar
reformatted images were obtained.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Respiratory motion
somewhat limits sensitivity for detection of pulmonary embolus
within the subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Apparent filling
defect is identified within the left lower lobe subsegmental
pulmonary artery on axial images (series 2, image 69), which is
not confirmed on multiplaner reformatted images and likely
represents partial volume averaging. No central or segmental
pulmonary embolus is identified. The thoracic aorta maintains a
normal contour without evidence of dissection.

The lungs are clear, without evidence of mass, nodule or
consolidation. Minimal atelectasis is seen within the dependent
portions of the lung. No pleural or pericardial effusion is
detected. The heart and great vessels are within normal limits.
A left subclavian central venous catheter is present with tip in
the distal SVC. No axillary or central lymphadenopathy is
appreciated. Limited views of the upper abdomen are
unremarkable.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is
identified.

IMPRESSION: Limited sensitivity for detection of subsegmental
pulmonary embolus given respiratory motion. Apparent filling
defect is seen within the left lower lobe s
