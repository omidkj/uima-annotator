Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Isosorbide

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
?chest pain, shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial line Placement
Cardiac catheterization
Tracheal Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation


History of Present Illness:
the patient is an 89-year-old man with history of hypertension,
aortic stenosis, CKD stage 2-3, and chronic obstructive asthma
who presented to the ED via EMS from [**Hospital3 2558**] (a halfway
house) with shortness of breath and hypoxemic respiratory
failure. The history was obtained from ED reports and caregivers
at his halfway house, since patient was intubated, sedated, and
unable to provide history.
.
Per report, patient was in his usual state of health until
3:20am on the morning of admission, when he developed acute
onset chest pain and said that he "could not breath." EMS was
called at this time. In the ambulance en route to the hospital,
patient became acutely dyspneic, with respiratory rate in the
40s and satting low 80s on non-rebreather.
.
He arrived to the emergency [**Hospital1 **] where initial vitals showed T
98.6, HR 96, BP 115/86, RR 40, satting 95% on 15L. Per report,
patient was talking and moving all extremities; however, he was
extremely dyspneic with respiratory rate in the 30s to 40s,
fighting to breath, and satting in the low 80s on the
non-rebreather. Patient reportedly said that he wanted
"everything done" and he was therefore intubated in the
emergency room for hypoxemic respiratory failure and started on
Fentanyl and Versed (proprofol was started initially but his
blood pressures dropped). Prior to intubation, he had been given
bronchodilator nebs with minimal improvement in symptoms. Labs
showed a white count of 19.9 with 78% polys and 1% bands.
Hematocrit was 36.6. Chemistry showed bicarb of 20, with anion
gap of 16. Creatinine was 2.5 (baseline is unknown). An ABG
showed 7.44/23/89 with lactate 5.2 (down to 2.2 one hour later).
CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions, and a BNP was drawn that
came back at [**Numeric Identifier **] (unfortunately there are no priors for
comparison). EKG revealed ST-depressions in the lateral leads.
An initial troponin was 0.18. Bedside echocardiogram showed no
pericardial effusion, per report.
.
For presumptive CAP, patient was given levofloxacin 750 mg IV x1
and ceftriaxone 1 gm IV x1; he was fluid resuscitated with 2L
normal saline. His vitals at the time of admission were
afebrile, HR 79, BP 124/77, and sat 96% on assist control
ventilation, FiO2 100% with PEEP 12, Vt 500, and rr 16. Access
includes 2x 20g peripheral IVs.
.
Review of systems: unable to obtain as patient was intubated and
sedated.

Reports
[**11-11**] Echocardiogram
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe ypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. There
is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 35 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**1-17**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction suggestive of CAD.
.
[**11-12**] Cardiac Catherization
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild aortic stenosis.
3. Severe diastolic dysfunction with markedly elevated left
sided
filling pressures with secondary pulmonary hypertension.
4. NSTEMI
5. Successful PCI to proximal LAD with DES
6. Successful angioseal closure device.
.
[**11-15**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. COPD and suspected pulmonary hypertension.
2. Mild cardiomegaly.
3. Dense left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. The
differential
includes a pneumonic infiltrate.
4. CHF with mild interstitial edema.
5. Probable small bilateral effusions.

CHEST (PA & LAT)	Study Date of [**2133-11-17**] 10:10 AM
1. Bilateral moderate effusions and associated atelectasis
2. Possible right lung lower lobe pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary this is an 89-year-old man with history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and aortic stenosis who presented
with acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath, intubated
in the emergency [**Hospital1 **] for hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Found
to have NSTEMI and now s/p cardiac cath showing 3 vessel CAD.
.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Pt intubated in ED. Etiology
was either CAP v. ACS. Pt found to have ACS with CHF on cardiac
cath.  3 vessel CAD, s/p BMS to proximal LAD.  Wedge pressure of
25-30, suggesting pulmonary congestion which is consistent with
elevated BNP and CXR showing pulmonary edema. Pt extubated on
[**11-15**]. Patient was also treated for CAP with ceftriaxone and
levofloxacin given elevated WBC to 20 with 1% bands on
admission. However with improving leukocytosis and no clinical
evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics were discontinued. Patient
improved over remaining length of stay and was discharged
without O2 requirement.
.
#NSTEMI: TTE showing EF 35%.  Troponins peaked at 1.19; pt taken
to cardiac cath s/p BMS to prox LAD.  Started aspirin, plavix,
beta blocker, and high dose statin. Given patient's unclear
renal function, he should be evaluated as an outpatient and
started on ACE inhibitor if Cr stable.
.
# Hypertension: SBP to 160s-170's at times, however usually
between 120-140??????s with uptitration of metorprolol. Pt discharged
on metroprolol 50 mg PO TID. Further titration should occur as
an outpatient
.
#AMS: Patient delirious post extubation. Placed on zyprexa while
delirium resolved. On discharge patient AAOx3 and did not have
require any anti-psychotics.
.
# Acute renal failure: Unclear baseline
