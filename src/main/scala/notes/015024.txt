History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was recently discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] after
undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, a tricuspid valve
repair, periardial patch to left ventricular wall, and Maze
procedure on [**2143-11-12**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]. Her hospital course
was complicated by aspiration pneumonia, pleural effusions,
renal failure and atrial fibrillation. She required prolonged
mechanical ventilatory support and inotropic support for some
time. With medical therapy and nutritional support, she
gradually made clinical improvements over several weeks. She was
discharged to rehab on POD#24. Within 24 hours after discharge,
she became increasing short of breath with increasing oxygen
requirements. She returned to the [**Hospital1 18**] EW. CXR was notable for
mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, and bilateral pleural
effusions, right greater than left. Her symptoms improved with
diuresis. She was subsequently admitted for further evaluation
and treatment.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to cardiac surgical service. Over
several days, she was diuresed with improvements in symptoms.
She eventually became hypotensive and was noted to have a
concomitant decline in renal function. She was transferred to
the CSRU for arterial line placement. Her BUN and creatinine
peaked to 88 and 1.8. Sodium was noted to be as high as 155.
With intravenous fluids and free water via feeding tube, her
hemodynamics and renal function gradually normalized. She did
not require inotropic support. Diuretics were temporarily
withheld as medical therapy was optimized. She eventually
returned to the SDU, where she worked daily with physical
therapy to regain strength and mobility. At time of discharge,
she remained deconditioned but was able to get out of bed with
assistance. At discharge chest chest x-ray showed no evidence of
acute congestive heart failure with improvement in bilateral
pleural effusions. She remained in a rate controlled atrial
fibrillation and maintained stable hemodynamics. Oxygen
saturations at time of discharge were 94% on 4 liters nasal
cannula. Warfarin was continued and dosed for a goal INR between
1.5 - 1.8.

During her hospitalization, she had a repeat swallow examination
on [**2143-12-9**] which revealed moderate oral and mild pharyngeal
dysphagia. There was however significant improvement in her
swallowing study since prior evaluation. She was able to use
compensatory techniques which effectively eliminated aspiration.
Based on the above, a PO diet of ground solids and thin liquids
was recommended. While the NG tube is in place, PO medications
should be crushed whole in puree. At time of discharge, her diet
was downgraded to nectar thick liquids as a precaution. On note,
she required replacement of her Dobbhoff Feeding tube on [**2143-12-11**]
as her original one clogged. This was performed at
Interventional Radiology without complication.
