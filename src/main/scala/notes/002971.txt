Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Keflex / Bactrim

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5119**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy [**2194-11-11**]- with severe malacia distal to the stent.


History of Present Illness:
66 year old female with history of COPD on home O2, CAD, CHF
with diastolic dysfunction, tracheomalacia s/p Y stent last in
[**7-/2194**], recent RUL MRSA pneumonia; admit on [**11-10**] to
thoracics/IP service with multifocal pneumonia.  She was
admitted to OSH in [**Month (only) 359**] for MRSA pneumonia and treated with
IV vancomycin with eventual transition to PO bactrim and
discharged to rehab.  Discharged home from rehab on [**11-7**]. Doing
well at home until [**11-9**], when developed worsening cough,
shaking chills, and noted fever to 102.  Called EMS; upon
arrival temp > 103.  Brought to OSH and noted to have multifocal
pneumonia on CXR.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continued care.
.
Arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] last night.  Admitted to IP.  Vancomycin given.
 Flex bronch performed this morning.  Bronch showed stent in
place (but malacia distal to stent); thick brown secretions.
BAL of superior segment of LLL performed. 4 versed and 100
fentanyl given.  Following the procedure, she required
increasing O2 (6L with transition to NRB).  Noted to be wheezy.
Nebs and solumedrol given.  Admitted to ICU due to increasing O2
requirements.

Patient reports a cough with production of white with sometimes
tan and sometimes blood streaked mucous.  No current/recent CP
(does report intermittent chest tightness during rehab stay when
breathing more difficult and wheezing).  No abdominal pain,
nausea. No dysuria.  +diarrhea.

MICU course: The pt was initially admitted to the IP service two
days ago for MRSA multifocal pneumonia as most of her care is
here. Got bronched here, got bronchospasm vs sedation from the
bronch. With the wheezing she was placed on a non rebreather.
She improved to 4L, which is her baseline. She still has diffuse
multifocal pneumonia. She is currently on Vancomycin and wsa
tapered from IV steroids to PO prednisone. A PICC was placed
bedside for a 14 day course of abx. Pending results for bronch
results. She will remain on coumadin for mitral valve
replacement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2194-11-11**] CXR Multifocal bilateral pneumonia. No pneumothorax. No
pleural effusion.
.
ECG: NSR at 92, NANI.  Does have S wave in I, Q in III and TWF
in III, but all are unchanged from prior dated [**2194-8-12**].

Echo [**2194-8-11**]: EF >55%. TR gradient 47-59.  Bileaflet MVR with
normal motion and gradients. 1+ MR, 1+TR, mod PA HTN.
.
PA/LAT [**2195-11-11**]: 1. Multifocal bilateral pneumonia.
2. Status post CABG and aortic valve replacement.
.
PORTABLE CXR [**2194-11-12**]:  In comparison with the study of [**11-11**],
there is continued diffuse bilateral airspace consolidation
representing multifocal bilateral pneumonia. No definite pleural
effusion. There is evidence of a prosthetic mitral valve and
previous CABG procedure. Broken second metallic suture is also
seen.
.
[**2194-11-12**] PICC placement:  1) Left-sided PICC with tip projecting
over the right atrium and will need to be withdrawn
approximately 2 cm. 2) Worsening bilateral air space opacities
likely representing worsening multifocal pneumonia. 3) No
pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2194-11-13**] Abdominal u/s: 1. Limited evaluation of the liver, but
no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. 2. Common hepatic
duct is prominent, measuring up to 6 mm, which could be within
normal range for patient's age or could be related to prior
cholecystectomy; however, choledocholithiasis cannot be
excluded, and correlation with MRCP can be performed if
clinically indicated.
.
[**2194-11-14**] PA and lateral: Multifocal pulmonary consolidation
which has been present in the past, reappeared on [**11-11**],
improved on [**11-12**], and has remained stable subsequently.
Although this could be multifocal infection, in the past,
abnormalities like this have been due to pulmonary hemorrhage,
sometimes due to over anticoagulation. Mild chronic cardiomegaly
and pulmonary vascular engorgement suggesting at least
borderline cardiac decompensation are also noted.
Tracheobronchial stent in place. Status post MVR.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 yr old female with severe COPD, tracheomalacia, recurrent
MRSA pneumonia presenting with shortness of breath.

1)Respiratory distress. Patient initially presented for bronch.
She developed wheezing, dyspnea, and increased O2 requirement
following bronch.  Treated with nebs and solumedrol.  Likely
related to airway reactivity.  Transitioned to prednisone and
needs to complete taper as outlined in medication list.
Treatment of pneumonia as below.  Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]
recommended - his secretary will call rehab facility to set up
appointment.

2) Pneumonia.  Pt presented with multifocal pneumonia, high
fevers.  Living at home but 3 days PTA was in nursing
facility/rehab, so covered broadly.  Later Bronchialveonar
lavage revealed MRSA and proteus sp which was pansensitive.
Initially on Vanco/Zosyn, then changed to Vanco and Ceftriaxone.
Needs 14 day total course

3) COPD.  On home O2.  Likely contributed to Resp distress.  S/p
Bronch [**11-11**] by Interventional pulmonology.  Nebulizers
uptitrated and steroid taper in place.

4) s/p MVR.  On coumadin, goal 2.5-3.5.  Recent echo with valve
in good position, 1+MR.  ON coumadin, but sub-therapeutic so on
heparin gtt to bridge. Once therapeutic after one day will stop
heparin.

5)  Anemia.  Slightly below baseline, likely [**1-25**] anemia of
inflammation from acute illness.  Continued on Iron
supplementation.

6) Congestive heart failure.  Preserved EF, ?diastolic
dysfunction.  MVR in place.  Appears slightly hypervolemic
currently, but improved compared to bas
