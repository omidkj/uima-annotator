IMAGING:

Chest x-ray: New moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is 56 year-old male with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
20%) and Type 1 diabetes who presented with hypotension,
pulmonary edema, and fever to 102.6.
.
1. Hypotension/Fever: Etiology of his presentation was unclear.
His hypotension responded to fluid ressucitation and pressors.
He was intially treated with stress dose steroids, which were
stopped once he had a normal cortisol stimulation test.
Infectious work-up was negative with the exception of a possible
infiltrate on chest x-ray.  Urinary legionella was negative.  He
was treated with levofloxacin for presumed community acquired
pneumonia.  He was discharged to complete a 14 day course of
levofloxacin.
.
2. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: He had no evidence of acute
ischemia.  He had 3 sets of cardiac enzymes that were negative.
He was maintained on his outpatient aspirin, plavix, statin, and
digoxin.  His metoprolol was initially held given hypotension,
but was restarted prior to discahrge.  Once he was no longer
hypotensive, he was restarted on his outpatient diuretics to
decrease his pulmonary edema.  He diuresed well.
.
3. Chronic kidney disease: He is status post renal transplant.
His creatinine was initially slightly above his baseline and
that improved with fluid ressucitation.  he was maintained on
cyclosporin (level therapeutic), azathioprine, and prednisone
for immunosuppression.
.
4. Diabetes: While in the intensive care unit, he required an
insulin drip for good glycemic control.  Once on the floor, he
was restarted on his outpatient glargine at 26 units at night.
At the time, he was not eating regularly and he had problems
with hypoglycemia.  His glargine was decreased to 6 units with
improvement in hypoglycemia.  His glargine will need to be
increased back to 26 once he is eating regularly.
.
5. Anemia: He has anemia secondary to renal disease.  He
receives epoeitin as an outpatient and did not received any
while an inpatient.  He did receive 1 unit of red cells during
this admission.
.
6. FEN: Cardiac, low salt, diabetic diet.  He had speech and
swallow evaluation that recommended a soft diet.
.
7. Code: full code
.
8. Dispo: He was discharged to an acute rehab
