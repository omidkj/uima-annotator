Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
tracheostomy evaluation, concern for altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Flexible bronchoscopy.
2. Tracheostomy tube change


History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old female, with a past medical history of
atrial fibrillation, memory loss s/p hypoglycemic coma with
anoxic brain injury, chronic low back pain, subarachnoid
hemorrhage, chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with
tracheostomy in place, who now presents for removal of trach,
and concern for altered mental status.

This patient has a complicated past medical history in which she
was admitted for subarachnoid hemorrhage ([**Date range (1) 107251**]),
discharged and then subsequently re-admitted for hyperbaric
respiratory failure requiring intubation ([**Date range (1) 107252**]). Her
hypercarbic respiratory failure is thought to be due to multiple
causes, including central and obstructive apnea, a chronic
paralyzed right hemidiaphragm, and obesity hypoventilation. On
her third admission ([**Date range (1) 107253**]), again for acute
hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, she was
found to have a tracheal tear seen on chest CTA, and confirmed
on bronchoscopy. Tracheostomy was performed to bypass the area
of the tear, as the patient was at high risk for repeated
intubation and the risk of causing perforation would be greater
in setting of re-intubation. The initial plan was to re-evaluate
the tracheostomy in 8 weeks after the tear healed. However, in
the interim, patient decided with her PCP to leave the trach in
place as treatment for the patient's presumed OSA. Trach removal
was further delayed by two hospitalizations at [**Hospital3 **] for pneumonia. She now presents for removal of trach.

Her husband is also concerned for the patient's worsening mental
status, with confabulation and loss of memory.  She has
reportedly been confused, not recognizing her husband and other
family members. She has baseline dementia as a result of anoxic
brain injury and hypoglycemic coma, but he reports that over
this has worsened over the last few weeks to months. The patient
denied these symptoms and further denied any fever, chills,
headache, vertigo or focal weakness.

Past Medical History:
Left Temporal Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
COPD - no prior h/o tobacco use, + secondhand exposure
afib - was on coumadin for last few years,anti-coagulation was
discontinued after her ICH
TIA - had prior episodes of flashes of light going across her
visual field, was placed on plavix.
Dementia - secondary to diabetic coma with anoxic brain injury
Chronic Low Back Pain
Anemia
GERD
Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure with history of
traumatic tracheal tear, s/p Tracheostomy placement on [**2103-3-8**]
- apparently multifactorial in etiology, including central and
obstructive apnea, chronically paralyzed R hemidiaphragm, and
obesity hypoventilation. Seen by sleep [**2103-2-26**] who recomended
her BiPAP settings.

Social History:
Lives with husband until recent admission, used to  work as the
press secretary to a state senator in the state  house. no
[**Month/Day/Year **]/etoh or illicits.  Husband was mechanically ventillating
patient at night at home.

CXR [**2103-7-10**]: Low lung volumes limit evaluation of the lung
parenchyma.
Mild nodular interstitial thickening especially within the left
lower lobe may represent atelectasis versus early pneumonia.
Clinical correlation is recommended.

CT Head [**2103-7-10**]: The ventricles are moderately enlarged given
the lack of
significant atrophy, particularly the third ventricle. Overall,
the size of the ventricles is not significantly changed when
viewed over serial images dating back to the patient's
presentation in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year. There is continued evolution
of the left temporal lobe hematoma, with vague lucency, though
no evidence to suggest interval bleeding. No persistent
intraventricular blood products are seen. There is hyperostosis
frontalis. There are no findings of acute infarct by CT. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

CXR [**2103-7-13**]: Right low lung volume with elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm is stable. New airspace opacity in the right lung
suggests early pneumonia in the right clinical setting. Left
lung is grossly clear.

CT abd/pelvis [**2103-7-14**]: Acute compression fracture at T12
without other evidence to explain abdominal pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62 year old female, with a past medical history of
atrial fibrillation, memory loss s/p hypoglycemic coma with
anoxic brain injury, chronic low back pain, subarachnoid
hemorrhage, chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with
tracheostomy in place, who presented to the emergency department
for removal of trach, and concern for altered mental status. The
patient was initially admitted to the ICU in order to receive
mechanical ventilation at night. In the MICU, she was weaned off
of the vent, and when transfered to floor, was able to cap her
trach during the day and remove the cap at night--no other
respiratory intervention was thought to be necessary.
Additionally, while in th ICU, the patient complained of back
and RUQ pain; abdominal CT to evaluate these complaints did not
show any acute intraabdominal pathology, but did show an acute
thoracic compression fracture.  There was some concern that the
patient was developing pneumona, as she had  increasing white
count, increased secretions over a few days prior to transfer to
the floor, as well as a chest xray with new infiltrate in the
right lower lung.
.
#1. Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure: Apparently the pt's
respiratory failure is the result of etiologies, including
central and obstructive sleep apnea, a chronic paralyzed R
hemidiaphragm, and obesity hypoventilation. The patient was
evaluated in [**2-22**] by sleep pulmonology and recommendations for
outpatient sleep study and empiric BiPAP were made. Although the
patient did well with nocturnal ventilator/BiPAP weaning in the
MICU, on the floor, she had rising bicarb (from 25 to  35 over 4
days) and sleep pulmonology was consulted to provide
recommendations on whether the patient should be on any kind of
positive pressure ventilation at nig
