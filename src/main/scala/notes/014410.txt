Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
woman with aortic stenosis, hypertension, and history of
recent flash pulmonary edema who was transferred from [**Hospital3 15416**] status post intubation for respiratory distress.

The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital6 1322**] on [**2190-1-19**] with a right posterolateral rib
fracture (status post fall).  During that admission, the
patient developed flash pulmonary edema and was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit where she received intravenous
Lasix, oxygen, morphine, nitroglycerin, and was ruled out for
a myocardial infarction.

An echocardiogram at that time showed moderate aortic
stenosis with a valve area of 1.1 and an estimated pulmonary
artery pressure gradient of 44.  It also showed
mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation and inferoposterior
hypokinesis, with an otherwise preserved ejection fraction.

The patient improved with medical management and diuresis at
[**Hospital6 2910**] and was discharged to [**Hospital3 15416**] on [**2190-1-22**].  As per family, the patient has
been complaining of shortness of breath in the last few days.

On the day of admission, at [**Hospital3 537**], Emergency Medical
Service was called for respiratory distress.  The patient
received nitroglycerin, morphine, and Lasix there with some
response.  During transportation to the ambulance in the
parking lot, the patient had worsening shortness of breath
and was intubated in the field.  Subsequent to the
intubation, it became clear that the patient was do not
resuscitate/do not intubate.  The patient was then brought to
the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room.

In the Emergency Department, her systolic blood pressure on
presentation was 180/100.  The patient was agitated and
uncomfortable.  She received 2 mg of Versed.  Subsequently
her systolic blood pressure dropped to the 40s to 50s.  She
was given 700 cc of normal saline with her systolic blood
pressure increasing to the 120s.  The intravenous fluid was
stopped.  A chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.  Her arterial
blood gas on arrival to [**Hospital1 69**]
was 7.29/49/462 with a lactate of 2.7.  This was on 100% FIO2
assist control 14X600 with a positive end-expiratory pressure
of 7.  A right femoral line was placed in the Emergency Room
for access.

I spoke extensively to her daughter ([**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]), and health
care proximally ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) who is her grandson as well as
her granddaughter.  [**Name (NI) **] health care proxy as well as her
granddaughter confirmed that the patient would not have
wanted to remain on life support long term and that she would
not have wanted to be resuscitated in the case of cardiac
arrest or invasive measures.

13.  Cataract surgery.
14.  Laminectomy (as mentioned above).
15.  Rib fracture

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to PENICILLIN.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
 2.  Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.
 3.  Cardizem-CD 240 mg by mouth once per day.

 9.  Tylenol by mouth as needed.
10.  Milk of Magnesia.
11.  Albuterol.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone with her daughter
nearby.  [**Name2 (NI) **] son is her health care proxy.  His name is
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35220**]).

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is unclear.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination, the
patient's temperature was 96.7 degrees Fahrenheit, her blood
pressure was 137/58, her heart rate was 73 (ventilator
setting was set on assist control FIO2 0.06, rate of 14,
tidal volume of 600, positive end-expiratory pressure of 7,
with an oxygen saturation was of 100%).  She was sedated but
easily aroused.  She responded to voice and touch.  She
responded appropriately.  The mucous membranes were moist.
She had a left surgical pupil and a reactive right pupil.
She had jugular venous distention to the angle of her jaw.
Her heart was regular in rate and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic
murmur loudest at the base.  She had upper respiratory
sounds, diffuse crackles, and suctioning produced some mucous
and food particles.  The abdomen was softly distended and
diffusely uncomfortable when palpated.  The patient reported
the onset of her abdominal pain after arrival in the
Emergency Room.  She had 1+ pitting edema bilaterally to the
knees.  Neurologically, she was alert and appropriately
nodded and shook her head to questions.  Her hands were
temporarily restrained to prevent removal of the endotracheal
tube by the patient.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Arterial blood
gas as mentioned above.  Chemistries revealed her sodium was
136, potassium was 5.9, chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 23,
blood urea nitrogen was 86, creatinine was 1.6 (which was up
from her baseline of 0.9), and her blood glucose was 245.
Her white blood cell count was 10.8, her hematocrit was 37
(baseline around 30 to 33), and her platelets were 267.  She
had 51% neutrophils, 4% bands, and 1% atypical cells.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed
endotracheal tube in good position with scarring at the right
lung base and pulmonary edema.

An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at 86 beats
per minute and a left bundle-branch block (as seen on her
previous electrocardiogram on [**2190-1-19**] at [**Hospital6 11896**] where it was noted to be new at that time).

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was diuresed
and extubated.  She initially required some [**Hospital1 **]-level positive
airway pressure for respiratory distress.  She was able to be
weaned to nasal cannula of 3 liters with an oxygen saturation
in the mid 90s.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was significant for multiple
episodes of hypotension to a systolic blood pressure of 60s
with diuresis.  She also experienced some angina which was
treated with morphine and aspirin.  Unfortunately, given her
low blood pressure beta blockers and nitrates were unable to
be given.  The patient was extremely clear and mentating
throughout her hypotensive episodes and continued to state
that she wanted to be comfortable and did not want aggressive
measures.

It was felt that her flash pulmonary edema was likely due to
ischemia in combination with her ventricles and with some
contribution from her aortic stenosis.  Her troponin levels
were slightly elevated at 0.03, 0.14, and 0.16.

Given the patient's continued assertion that she did not want
invasive measures, she was treated conservatively with
morphine.

Her acute renal failure was worked up with urine chemistries.
Her fractional excretion of urea nitrogen was 24%;
suggesting a prerenal azotemia.  Given her pulmonary edema,
she was not given any intravenous hydration.  Her ACE
inhibitor was discontinued given her renal failure.  Her
hyperkalemia improved with her diuresis and came down to 5.1.
She was started on Renagel for her phosphate of 7.

Extensive discussions with the patient and her health care
proxy ([**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]), and her granddaughter, and her
granddaughter-in-law regarding the patient's situation and
her wishes to place, it was decided that the patient would go
