History of Present Illness:
.
PCP:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 45938**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 45939**], [**Hospital **] Hospital ED
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 77108**].
.
HPI:  74yoF with PMH of tobacco use and glaucoma (no regular
medical care with last PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 6 years ago) who developed
fever and body aches [**2136-2-1**] and progressively worsening
confusion since then presented to her PCP's office today with
complaints of generalized malaise and feeling unwell.  She
specifically complained of inability to sleep and requested
sleep medication however also endorsed generalized weakness and
perhaps some dizziness.  Her PCP referred her to [**Hospital **]
Hospital ED given her symptoms and she reportedly looked
"overall unwell".  She (and family) report that her symptoms
began on [**2136-2-1**] at which time she developed "body aches" and
subjective fevers/chills.  She also had a very mild dry cough.
Her daughter reports progressive confusion mainly over the past
few days.  She has also had poor PO intake (food and fluid) [**3-10**]
poor appetite.  She denies sore throat, runny nose,
N/V/diarrhea/abdominal pain, dysuria/hematuria.  She further
denies night sweats, signifiant weight loss.  She also denies
HA, changes in vision, neck stiffness.
.
At the OSH ED, noted peripheral blood WBC >60K with a reported
"left shift".  RUL infiltrate was noted on CXR and she received
1 dose levofloxacin IV.  ABG initially showed pCO2=59 however
she became increasingly lethargic and repeat ABG showed pCO2=78.
 She was simultaneously noted to be hypoxemic (paO2 not clear),
but SaO2 70% on NRB prior to intubation.  She was intubated and
was noted to be hypotensive with nadir 65/40 (? post sedation
vs. before) and was started on dopamine via peripheral IV
initially at 20mcg/kg/min.  Dopamine was decreased to
5mcg/kg/min prior to transfer with maintenance of SBPs 90s.  She
became tachycardic to the 140s on dopamine so was changed to
levophed without tachycardia and maintenance of MAPS
approximately 50-60.
.
Transferred to MICU for presumed sepsis.
.
ROS:  As above, also denies rashes.  + DOE when walking up
stairs, no PND, orthopnea (per family history).  No
melena/hematochezia.

Glaucoma eye gtts

      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other

Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may
vary.
