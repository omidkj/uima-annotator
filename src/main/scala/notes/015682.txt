Chief Complaint:
ICU complaint: Hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 41460**] is an 88 y/o Russian speaking female with a h/o
multiple falls who presents s/p fall with a left hip fracture.
She initially fell on [**8-5**] and reportedly had an x-ray done at
that time which did not show any fracture. However since the
first she has been unable to walk due to left hip pain. When the
pain persisted she had another x-ray done which showed a left
femoral neck fracture so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.8, 89, 158/84, 18, 97% RA.
Imaging was notable for a left hip fracture, head and neck CT's
with no acute process. She was seen by orthopedics who requested
a pelvis CT and given her intermediate HOME score wanted her to
be admitted to medicine for preoperative evaluation and
management. She was given morphine for pain control and
admitted. VS prior to transfer: 98.1, 74, 138/76, 16, 95% on RA.

.
On the floor her initial VS were: 95.9, 152/88, 88, 18, 98% on
RA. She is currently resting comfortably.

studies:
cxr [**2163-8-10**]:
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including
cardiomegaly. There is
slight interval improvement in currently minimal pulmonary
edema. Surgical
clips projecting over the mediastinum are unchanged. Small
amount of
bilateral pleural effusion is most likely present.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
cxr [**2163-8-11**]:
The ET tube tip currently is in unchanged position approximately
6.7 cm above the carina. The heart size and mediastinal contours
are unchanged. Interval improvement up to almost complete
resolution of interstitial edema is noted.
Right lower lobe opacity most likely consistent with small areas
of
atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 41460**] is an 88 y/o F with a significant cardiac history
who presents s/p a fall with a left femoral neck fracture.
.
#) Hip Fracture: Pt was admitted for a left femoral neck
fracture, which was successfully repaired by orthopedics. Her
immediate post-operative course was complicated by oversedation
from medications (fentanyl, morphine, etc), leading to
hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was reintubated as she was
in respiratory failure and also deemed full code for the 24 hour
perioperative period. She also had transient hypotension related
to excess metoprolol (is allergic to this as it causes
hypotension, bradycardia), morphine, fentanyl, and propofol and
quickly normalized after holding these medications. Patient was
ruled out for MI and hypotension was thought not to be sepsis
given no fever, white count, lactate elevation, clear CXR, focal
signs/symptoms. U/A was mildly positive and she was started on
CTX, with cultures sent and revealed no growth. She was
extubated the following morning without complications and did
very well from a respiratory standpoint after all the sedating
medications wore off. Her hip pain was controlled with standing
tylenol and oxycodone PRN. Lovenox was continued post
operatively as prophylaxis and should be continued for four
weeks per ortho recs. She was seen by physical therapy who
recommended a rehab stay. She will f/u with ortho after
discharge.
.
#) CAD s/p: continued home isosorbide mononitrate, and aspirin.
Beta blockade was held because of her allergy to beta blockers
leading to severe hypotension, bradycardia.
.
#) CHF: continued her home lasix dose prior to operation, no
evidence of decompensated heart failure prior to operatiion. She
had mild pulmonary edema on chest x-ray after procedure but
remained stable at her home O2 requirement of 2LNC.
.
#) A flutter: Patient was in and out of sinus and a flutter with
only one episode of RVR in the post-operative period. Otherwise
remained in sinus with normal rate. Patient has not been
anticoagulated secondary to falls risk.

#) Hypothyroid: continued home levothyroxine
.
#) Diabetes: continued home glargine, add a humalog sliding
scale, held home humalin with meals while NPO.
.
#) Depression: continued home citalopram
.
#) Glaucoma: continued home eye drops
.
Code: DNR/DNI per documentation from nursing home and discussion
with HCP. Was temporarily reversed to full code in the 24 hour
perioperative period.
