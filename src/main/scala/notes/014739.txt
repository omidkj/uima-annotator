Service:  ACOVE

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
84-year-old man with history of myelodysplastic syndrome and
lower gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to arteriovenous
malformations.  The patient presented to the operating room
after awaking on the day of admission with acute shortness of
breath and palpitations.  When the EMTs arrived to the scene
and found the patient, they noted that he was tachycardiac.
he received Adenosine and ultimately went into normal sinus
rhythm.  In the emergency room he was again tachycardiac
after receiving Dobutamine for hypertension.  On arrival to
the ER, the patient's blood pressure was 80.  He was
subsequently started on Neo-Synephrine to maintain
hypotension.  Chest x-ray revealed right lower lobe
pneumonia.  The patient was admitted to the MICU for further
management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History was notable for
myelodysplasia, history of arteriovenous malformations,
peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, colon cancer status post
resection, vocal cord tumor status post XRT.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol.
2.  Multivitamin.
3.  Omeprazole.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to CODEINE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient never married.  The patient has
no children.  The patient quit smoking 30 years ago.  The
patient does not drink or use drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission is notable
for a temperature of 100.5, pulse 85, blood pressure 99/50,
respiratory rate 40, 95% on 100% rebreather.  The patient had
no JVD on examination.  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to
light.  The patient had crackles at the right base; regular
rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2.  ABDOMEN:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the hematocrit
of 10.3, hematocrit 21, sodium 144, potassium 5.5, chloride
115, bicarbonate 12, BUN 47, creatinine 2.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a very prolonged hospital
course.  He was initially admitted to the MICU and treated
for right lower lobe pneumonia with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
and Flagyl.  The patient's sputum cultures ultimately grew
....................and he was then treated with Bactrim and
ultimately Zosyn and Flagyl.

Hospital course was also complicated by hypotension.  He was
treated with pressors, which ultimately resolved.  He also
went into rapid atrial fibrillation and he was treated with
Amiodarone and Lopressor as tolerated.  He had a Swan-Ganz
catheter placed, which was consistent with cardiogenic shock.
The patient required intubation after two days secondary to
worsening respiratory distress.  He was ultimately extubated
on [**9-4**] and he had to use BiPAP intermittently since he did
not tolerate extubation immediately.  The patient's
respiratory status did not improve significantly even after
extubation.  He had a lot of difficulty clearing his own
secretions.  On [**9-7**], it was decided to make the
patient comfort measures only.  The patient expired on
[**9-8**].

DATE OF EXPIRATION:  [**2123-9-8**].

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hypotension.
2.  Right lower lobe pneumonia.
3.  Sepsis.
