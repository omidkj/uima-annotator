Brief Hospital Course:
66-year-old female with h/o of HTN, h/o of cardiomyopathy (now
normal EF) on ACE-I therapy who presents with acute onset of
"tongue swelling".  She was seen by ENT in the ermegency
department and larygnoscopy revealed a patent airway and
significant anterior oropharyngeal edema.  It was felt that her
tongue swelling likely represented angioedema (no evidence of
Ludwig's on exam - clinical hx did not fit).  Her airway
remained patent and she did not require intubation at any time.
She was placed on Decadron 10mg IV q6, Pepcid 20mg IV bid, and
Benadryl IV prn to decrease her angioedema, along with holding
her levaquin, aspirin and lisinopril. She was observed overnight
in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and was called out to the floor once her angioedema
had improved significantly.  ENT continued to perform periodic
laryngoscopy which revealed improving edema.  They recommended
tapering Decadron to 10mg IV q8 prior to arrival on the floor.
Her angioedema improved significantly, and she was felt to be
safe for discharge without any additional steroids with ENT
follow-up.  She was given a prescription for EpiPens and was
given instructions on how and when to use the pen.
.
Her other medical issues included a recent UTI which should have
been adequately treated by 4 days of Levaquin, and a thyroid
nodule for which she is undergoing an outpatient work-up.  She
also has a history of systolic congestive heart failure, but her
most recent ECHO revealed a normal LVEF.  She was discharged on
her Toprol XL without her ACE-I.
