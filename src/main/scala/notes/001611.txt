HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
woman, who was here, visiting her nephew from [**State 2690**].  In the
middle of the night, she got up to go to the bathroom and
opened the basement door, instead of the bathroom door, and
fell down the stairs.  The patient was intubated at the
to two minutes.  This was preceded by combative behavior.
The head CT revealed an intraparenchymal bleed and left
subarachnoid bleed with a question of midline shift.  The
head CT also revealed right skull fracture from the parietal
occipital juncture, extending to the skull, base, and foramen
Magnum; also with left temporal attenuation, may be an
interparenychmal hemorrhage and left frontal-lobe density

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the ICU.  The
patient had a vent drain placed.  The patient was sent to the
surgical ICU for close monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history
of hypertension for which she was taking Atenolol and Vasotec
prior to admission to the hospital.  The patient has no other
past medical history.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient has no other past
surgical history.

On arrival to the ER the GCS score was 70.  She had no other
obvious injuries.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the heart rate was 69,
blood pressure 141/62, temperature 96.8, respiratory rate 16,
saturation 99%.  Pupils were 4:6 on the left and 4:3 and
brisk on the right.  She had hemotympanum on the right, large
right scalp laceration.  She was intubated and sedated,
following no commands and not responding to pain.

Repeat head CT on [**11-22**] showed contusion and subarachnoid
hemorrhage, left anterior temporal, interparenchymal
hemorrhages, right frontal lobe hemorrhage, left greater than
right and right subdural hematoma, which was small.  The
cervical spine films revealed a C6 fracture.  The patient
also had thoracic spine films, which revealed a T3 fracture.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Neurological examination on [**2197-11-23**]
revealed that the patient was still intubated.  She had
partial localization of the left upper extremity and question
of extension posturing on the right upper extremity and brisk
withdrawal of the lower extremities.  Pupils were 3 down to 2
bilaterally.  Head CT revealed partial blossoming of the
frontal bleed.  The patient CTA of the brain, which showed no
evidence of aneurysm for cause of subarachnoid blood.

On [**2197-11-25**], the patient's sputum culture came back with
gram-negative rods.  The patient was started on
Ciprofloxacin.  Neurologically, pupils equal, round, and
reactive, but withdrawing in the upper extremities and
flexing in the lower extremities bilaterally.  The patient
was on CPAP at 40%.

On [**2197-11-26**], neurological examination revealed the
following:  Pupils remained 4-mm and reactive bilaterally.
She has an impaired corneal on the right and intact corneal
on the left, positive gag, positive cough.  The patient was
unresponsive, except to withdrawal on all four extremities to
nail bed pressure.  Minimal spontaneous movement noted and
the patient did open eyes half way with logrolling.  The
patient was unable to focus on the examination.  The ICP
drain remains in place at 20 cm above the tragus with ICPs 17
to 20.  The patient was loaded on Dilantin on admission and
Dilantin was continued until [**2197-12-11**], when it was
discontinued.  The ICP drain remained in place until
[**2197-12-5**].  The patient was fitted, TLSO brace arrived. The
patient was in TLSO brace at all times, head of the bed
greater than 45 degrees.  While in bed, the patient should be
logrolled only.  The patient was treated with Acyclovir for
herpes zoster on her lips.  She also had yeast in her urine,
for which she received a full treatment of Diflucan.  She was
also treated for an MRSA pneumonia.

Currently, the patient is receiving IV Vancomycin, 1-gram IV
q 12 hours and p.o. Levaquin 500 mg p.o.q.d.

The patient was Oxacillin from [**11-21**] to [**12-5**], Ciprofloxacin
from [**11-21**] to [**12-6**], Diflucan from [**12-4**] to [**12-9**] and
Ceftazidime from [**12-7**] to the current time.  The patient had
tracheostomy tube and PEG tube on [**2197-12-7**]; tracheostomy
mask at 40% on [**2197-12-11**].  Neurologically, as of [**2197-12-18**],
the patient opened her eyes;  was able to say her name;
moving the upper extremities strongly; lower extremities
flexing minimally to pain.  The patient remained at flat bed
rest, otherwise, in TLSO brace.  The patient is having a MRI
of the thoracic and cervical spine on [**2197-12-18**]; results
pending.



MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Atenolol 100 mg p.o.q.d.
2.  K-Dur 20 mg per G-tube q.d.
3.  Vancomycin 1-g IV b.i.d., which was started on
[**2197-12-7**].
4.  Levaquin 500 mg per G-tube q.d. begin on [**2197-12-8**].
5.  Salt tabs per G-tube q.d., 2-g.
6.  NPH Insulin, two units subcutaneously q.m. and q.p.m.
7.  Nystatin powder to the groins.
8.  Promote tube feeding at 60 cc per hour via her J-tube.

The patient has a Passy-Muir valve for her tracheostomy.  She
was on log-roll precautions whenever the brace is off.  The
brace must be on at all times if head of bed is greater than
45 degrees or patient is out of bed.  C-collar must remain in
place due to the C6 fracture at all times for twelve-week
total.  The patient is on MRSA precautions for the MRSA in
her sputum.

The patient is being transferred to an acute hospital in
