Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: AMS, fever, hypoxia, renal failure

Reason for MICU transfer: AMS requiring intubation


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
 This is a 60 year old gentleman with a history of HIV last cd4
in [**1-25**] was 783 and VL undetectable who arrives with respiratory
distress, fevers x1day. Also having myoclonic jerks similar to
those seen on two previous admissions, for which no etiology was
found but presumed to be [**12-17**] metabolic derangements. Initial
hypoxic to 60-70's on RA, febrile to 101.8 (R). Labs show new
renal failure. During ED stay, patient remains febrile and
becomes increasingly altered/combative.
.
Of note, patient was most recently admitted for myoclonic jerks
and altered mental status from [**Date range (1) 96656**]. He was found to be
in renal failure, positive opioid tox screen. Renal hypothesized
ritonavir-induced nephrotoxicity was initial insult (ritonavir
crystals in urine), worsened by lisinopril and prerenal azotemia
in setting of insufficient PO intake and diarrhea. On discharge
all HAART was discontinued, as was Lyrica. Morphine and Lyrica
also held during hospitalization. Per OMR, Lyrica and Morphine
were re-prescribed on [**2208-4-7**]. There are no recent notes in OMR
documenting recent healthcare, and his wife could not be reached
by phone in the MICU.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  101.0 124 124/63 16 74% RA. Initial
physical exam was significant for tremulousness and combative
behavior.  Initial labs were signficant for cr 4.9 (baseline
1.2), K+ 4.2, CK 4619, MB 58 and MBI 1.3.  LFTs were mildly
elevated with a normal t.bili and lipase. A serum tox screen was
negative and urine tox screen positive for opiates. A lactate
was 1.7. A UA was negative.  An EKG demonstrated sinus
tachycardia. Given his elevated CK, MB and troponin (despite
flat MBI and presence of [**Last Name (un) **]), a heparin gtt was started for
empiric management of ACS. Cards recommends continuing to trend
enzymes. His oxygen saturations on arrival were in the 70s which
improved with a non-rebreather. A PE was entertained but could
not be addressed with a CTA [**12-17**] [**Last Name (un) **], thus heparin was further
pursued.  A CXR revealed evidence of a pneumonia and given
hypoxia and h/o COPD, he was started on vancomycin and cefepime
for management of a pna and IV solumedrol and albuterol and
ipratropium nebs for a  copd exacerbation. He became more
combative over time and the patient was ultimately intubated for
safety after ativan and haldol did not improve his mental
status. An initial ABG demonstrated 7.24/70/93 and subsequent
was 7.24/62/99.  Vent settings on transfer were: Fio2 100% PEEP
5, TV 550.  An LP was performed and results were pending at the
time of transfer. A CT head demosntrated no findings. He
received 4 L NS prior to transfer. Vitals on transfer: 134/97,
64, 22
.
On arrival to the MICU, vitals are: 98.0 144/105 22 100% (vent
settings: FiO2 50% PEEP 5 TV 550). Patient was agitated and
attempting to self-extubate so was bolused with fentanyl and
midazolam.
.
Review of systems: unable to obtain, patient intubated

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospitalization Summary:
60 year old gentleman with a history of HIV last cd4 in [**1-25**] was
783 and VL undetectable who arrives with respiratory distress
and altered mental status
.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS - Patient presented to the ER very
agitated. His wife explained that he had been confused for the
past day. He was intubated for safety after his agitation was
not affected by ativan/haldol administration. On HD#2, he was
extubated and as his renal function improved, he became more
oriented and conversant. His confusion was thought to be
secondary to morphine, lyrica, and other medications
accumulating in his acute renal failure. His Utox was + for
morphine. He had had a similar presentation over the past year.
LP was negative, Head CT negative, and HSV PCR negative.
.
# HYPOXIC HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient was hypoxic
on arrival to the ER with O2 sats in the 60s-70s on RA. Initial
ABG (likely on significant O2 nc) showed 7.24/70/93 making
hypercarbic respiratory failure from accumulation of narcotics
in renal failure most likely. He was intubated in the ER for
safety and his hypercarbia and hypoxia improved. He was
extubated on HD#2 and weaned to 2L nc prior to being called-out.
Steroids and antibiotics were intiallly started for possible
COPD exacerbation but these were later discontinued. Home
nebulizers were continued.
.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Cr was 4.2 on arrival. Acute renal
failure was thought to be pre-renal and it improved dramatically
over 2 days with IVF to his baseline of 1.1. Other causes such
as tenofovir toxicity were also entertained. HAART medications
were initially held but were restarted as Cr returned to
baseline.
.
# TRANSAMINITIS: [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to his known HCV with high
viral load. [**Month (only) 116**] be med-related: in particular, Raltegravir can
cause elevated LFTs (especially in patien
