Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
AMS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
At time of encounter patient was intubated, thus history is from
patient's wife and prior records.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 87yo man who
was in his USOH until about 10:30am this morning, when he
"didn't feel right" while walking to the bathroom. He then lay
down again and told his wife he "felt fine," however a short
while later he went downstairs and his wife heard a "thud" and
found her husband on the floor in the kitchen with a chair
overturned on top of him. He told her he was fine but was
apparently holding his head.  His wife called 911 and when she
returned he was unresponsive. No seizure activity noted. Per EMS
the patinet was confused and then one minute later was entirely
unresponsive with GCS 3.
.
There, head CT showed a small L posterior temporal SAH, which
was confirmed on head MRI/A. He was given thiamine and was
intubated. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, he was sedated with propofol and was seen by
neurosurgery who assessed that his SAH was too small for
operative management, and care was deferred to neurology. He was
evaluated by neurology, who believed that his SAH was likely
traumatic and related to his fall rather than the cause of his
fall.  Electrolytes returned markedly abnormal and the patient
reported had a 7 beat run of vtach, followed by wavering heart
rates greater than 100 in afib, and then in NSR and in the low
60s. Cardiology was in the department, and saw the pt's rhythm
strips, declaring that this particular rhythm was unlikely the
cause of his syncopal episode.  Neuro believed that, given his
electrolyte abnormalities, the most likely etiology was
"metabolic" versus cardiac. They recommended repeat head CT to
evaluate his SAH, and will assess for need for EEG based on his
course and responsiveness. They recommended repleting his
electrolytes, however after this recommendation, repeat studies
returned and were relatively unremarkable. The ER covered with
vancomycin and ceftriaxone for possible meningitis, but LP was
not performed in the ER due to the pt's "changing heart
rhythms."  He was given a total of 1L of IVF, and he received
most of a 40mEq IV potassium repletion as well as 20meq of PO
potassium and 2g IV magnesium.  He was transferred to the MICU
for further management.

STUDIES:
.
Echo [**6-2**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast (rest injection only). Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 70%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Head CT [**6-2**]: Small subarachnoid hemorrhage in left posterior
temporal lobe unchanged from study 14 hours prior. MRI would be
recommended if clinical concern for infarct remains.
.
CXR: Endotracheal tube as above. Advance nasogastric tube [**6-24**]
cm. No
acute process.
.
[**Location (un) 620**] chest CT with contrast performed for r/o dissection: NO
EVIDENCE OF AORTIC DISSECTION.  ASCVD.  HH. BILATERAL
COMPRESSIVE
ATELECTASIS.  HEPATIC AND RENAL CYSTS.  SMALL LOW DENSITY LESION
IN THE SPLEEN CONSISTENT WITH A CYST OR HEMANGIOMA.
 - per discussion with radiology resident, also no central PEs
seen on this study. Cannot rule out subsegmental PE given timing
of contrast not ideal for this.
.
[**Location (un) 620**] head CT: PROBABLE SMALL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE IN THE
LEFT POSTERIOR TEMPORAL LOBE.  NO OTHER ACUTE ABNORMALITIES ARE
DETECTED.  THERE IS EVIDENCE OF CHRONIC ISCHEMIA WITH NUMEROUS
LACUNAR INFARCTIONS.
.
repeat head CT: Small subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left
posterior temporal lobe, without significant change in size from
12:30 p.m. today. Findings were posted to the ED dashboard at
10:30 p.m. on [**2119-6-1**].
.
CT C-spine: 1. No acute traumatic injury in the cervical spine.
2. Nasogastric tube coiled in the hypopharynx.
.
head MR/MRA (neuro attg read) from [**Location (un) 620**]: scattered FLAIR and
T2 abnormalities c/w small vessel disease. There was a small SAH
in the left parieto-temporal region.  There were no DWI or T2*
abnormalities.  His MRA was normal with good flow in the VA & BA
arteries.  No aneurysms were noted.
.
(rads read) INCREASE SIGNAL SEEN IN THE UPPER MID BRAIN AND
MEDIAL THALAMI COULD BE CONSISTENT WERNICKE'S ENCEPHALOPATHY IN
PROPER CLINICAL SETTING.  CLINICAL CORRELATION RECOMMENDED.
EVIDENCE OF SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE IN THE LEFT TEMPORAL SULCI
CONSISTENT WITH THE FINDINGS SEEN ON THE RECENT CT. MILD TO
MODERATE BRAIN ATROPHY AND SMALL VESSEL DISEASE. NORMAL MRA OF
THE HEAD.

lung is clear. Incidental degenerative changes AC joint and
central line catheter via right arm.
