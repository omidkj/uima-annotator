Admission Date:  [**2151-4-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2151-4-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2089-3-12**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old white male
with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and cardiac
risk factors including strong family history, age, sex and
cigar smoking, who presented to an outside hospital with
severe ten out of ten substernal chest pain, burning,
diaphoresis, nausea and vomiting.  He denied any shortness of
breath, radiation to the neck, radiation to the jaw or
radiation to the arm.  He had no recent decrease in exercise
tolerance.  He denied any edema or weight gain.  He denied
any abdominal pain.  He denied any orthopnea or paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.  He denied any fever, chills, changes in
bowel or bladder function, bright red blood per rectum,
melena or weight loss.  In the outside hospital, an
electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in leads II, III, and
aVF.  It also showed R wave with ST depressions in V1 and V2,
and ST elevations in V5 and V6.  Culprit lesion on
catheterization was noted to be a total occlusion with
thrombus in the midleft circumflex.  The lesion was
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied, Angioject
and stented with a Hepacoat stent.  The patient's flow in
that vessel went from TIMI-0 to TIMI-3 with resolution of his
electrocardiographic changes.  He had some reperfusion ectopy
which resolved.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives in [**Location 43709**] with his wife. Two
children.  He smokes cigars but no pipes, tobacco or alcohol.
He is works in financing and accounting.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother and father both had myocardial
infarctions in their 50s and 60s, respectively.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Zantac as needed.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile, heart rate
66, blood pressure 159/85, respiratory rate 12, oxygen
saturation 100% on two liters nasal cannula.  In general, the
patient is alert and oriented in no apparent distress.  No
chest pain, no nausea.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements are intact.  The oropharynx is clear.
Chest is clear to auscultation anteriorly with lateral and
posterior crackles at the bases.  Cardiovascular - regular
rate and rhythm without murmurs, normal S1 and S2, no S3 or
S4.  The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, positive
bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly,   Groin - sheaths in the
left groin, clean, dry and intact.  Extremities - no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema, palpable pulses distally.
Psoriatic plaque on bilateral lower extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
18.0, hematocrit 45.0, platelet count 265,000.  Sodium 147,
potassium 4.2, chloride 107, bicarbonate 27, blood urea
nitrogen 25, creatinine 1.4 and glucose 153.  Liver function
tests were within normal limits.  First CK was 120 with a
troponin of 0.05.  Chest x-ray was pending.

Cardiac catheterization revealed left main coronary artery
normal.  The left anterior descending showed mild luminal
irregularities.  The left circumflex showed a midsegment
total occlusion into OM2.  Ostial 90% lesions in the OM1 at
the site of occlusion in the left circumflex were also found.
The right coronary artery was the dominant vessel with mild
luminal irregularities.  Pressures and other readings on
catheterization - cardiac output was 3.45, cardiac index was
1.92, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 23, pulmonary
artery pressure were 39/18, right ventricular pressure was
39/13, right atrial pressure was 19/14.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 62 year old white male with a history
of smoking, strong family history, status post
catheterization and stent for an acute ST elevation inferior
posterior myocardial infarction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The following is a summary of the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course by problems:

1.  Ischemia - The patient had no further chest pain while in
house.  He was kept on Integrilin for 18 hours after his
cardiac catheterization and then it was discontinued   He was
continued on a beta blocker and an ace inhibitor.  He was
loaded with Plavix and then given 75 mg p.o. once daily.  He
was continued on Aspirin.  He was started on a statin.
Towards the end of his hospital stay, the patient's beta
blocker was changed from Metoprolol to one a day Atenolol and
his ace inhibitor was changed from Captopril to one a day
Lisinopril.  The patient's cardiac enzymes were trending and
peaked at 4,510 for his CK, 339 for CK MB, and troponin
greater than 50.  These enzymes down-trended.  The patient
had cholesterol studies which revealed a normal LDL, normal
HDL, and a normal cholesterol.  His triglycerides were also
normal.

2.  Pump - The patient was gently diuresed while in house.
He received small doses of intravenous Lasix with good
results.  The patient underwent an echocardiogram which
revealed that his left atrium was normal in size, left
ventricular wall thickness and cavity size were normal, mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction existed,
resting regional wall motion abnormalities including a basal
inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis existed, aortic valve
leaflets were mildly thickened, mild aortic regurgitation was
seen, mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened, trivial
mitral regurgitation was seen, tricuspid valve leaflets were
mildly thickened, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
was noted, and there was a trivial pericardial effusion.  His
ejection fraction was calculated to be 55%.  The patient did
undergo a chest x-ray which revealed mild upper zone
redistribution and for that he was gently diuresed as
mentioned above.  The patient also had a Swan-Ganz catheter
placed for better monitoring of his right sided pressures.
This catheter was discontinued towards the end of his
hospital stay.

3.  Rhythm - The patient was continued on telemetry given the
fact that he had two episodes of ventricular tachycardia
early during his hospital stay.  He did not have any ectopy
during the rest of his hospital stay, and was considered to
be stable after a 72 hour observation period.

4.  Tobacco use - The patient was counseled on smoking
cessation.

5.  FEN - The patient had his electrolytes measured daily and
if needed these were repleted accordingly without
complication.  He was also started on a heart healthy diet.

Based on the patient's stable clinical condition, the
decision was made to discharge the patient home with
appropriate follow-up.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post inferoposterior wall
myocardial infarction, status post cardiac catheterization
and stenting of the left circumflex.
2.  Mild congestive heart failure secondary to systolic
dysfunction with a normal ejection fraction.
3.  Mild hypertension.
4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient is to follow-up with cardiology in two to
four weeks.
2.  His primary care physician is to help him select a
cardiologist in his [**Location 27224**] of [**Location (un) 43709**] or he is welcome to
select a cardiologist through the [**Hospital1 190**] system.
3.  The patient is to follow-up with his primary care
physician to have renal function tests, liver function tests,
and blood pressure check within one to two weeks.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.
4.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. once daily times thirty days. Please
note, the patient's cardiologist should determine the length
of Plavix treatment after the thirty days.
5.  Aspirin Enteric Coated 325 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n.
