CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Removal CT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old man s/p ASC Ao Aneurysm repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Removal CT
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient with ascending
aorta aneurysm repair.

Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2146-12-30**].

There is no interval change in the position of the Swan-Ganz, ET
tube, and NG tube. There is also no change in the left
retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis. On the other
hand, there is bilateral increase in perihilar opacities
continuing toward the lower lungs with bilateral interstitial
prominence; findings consistent with worsening pulmonary edema.
Left lateral chest wall was not included in the field of view,
thus precise evaluation of left pleural effusion cannot be
obtained.

IMPRESSION: Worsening mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast in the body of the LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA
ejection velocity. No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. PFO
is present. Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at
rest.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Top normal/borderline
dilated LV cavity size. Mildly depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Markedly dilated ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Moderately dilated
aortic arch. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Mildly dilated

the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage.
2. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 45-55 %).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. The ascending aorta is markedly dilated .The aortic arch is
moderately dilated. There is a dissection flap extending from
the sino tubular junction to the descending thoracic aorta with
a true lumen visible. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen
on the aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Moderate
(2+)- (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
9. There are moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions.
9. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine and A-V pacing.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved. AI now 1+.
Synthetic graft in aortic position without hematoma. Descending
aorta shows no flow in the false lumen. MR is trace. Pericardial
effusion is small. Pleural effusion on left is small.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the cardiac surgery ICU. Echo showed no
tamponade. The risk of operating in the setting of coagulopathy
and liver failure was deemed too high and he awaited recovery
prior to surgery. He was transfused with platelets, FFP and
vitamin K. he was followed by hepatology, cardiology and
nephrolog
