Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Patient was found down.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
.

History of Present Illness:
49 yo M with a history of EtOH abuse and DT's, significant
tobacco history and prescription drug abuse with odd behavior
and ?respiratory suppression found unresponsive at home with
cardiac arrest.
.
The patient's mother and sister report that the patient has a
long history of substance abuse. He has a history of significant
EtOH abuse with DT's and more recently prescription drug abuse
including benzodiazepines. The patient has been acting odd by
family report since [**2111-7-22**]. There is high concern for
substance abuse. The patient was not known to be suicidal. On
the morning of admission, the patient was seen by his mother at
his home and was noted to be "in a haze" acting as if "in a
stupor." Later in the day the patient's mother found him asleep
in bed and over many minutes was noted to have poor breathing.
EMS was called and the he was thought to be in asystole vs. VF
and received epinephrine and atropine x3 followed by
cardioversion with return to sinus rhythm. The patient was
intubated and sedated in the field and brought to [**Hospital **]
Hospital prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**]. There was concern
for intentional overdose as a cause of his arrest however tox
screen was notable only for EtOH level in the 200's at the OSH.
In the ED the patient was initiated on a cooling protocol. CXR
revealed left-sided retrocardiac opacity concerning for
aspiration and in light of leukocytosis, the patient was started
on levofloxacin and metronidazole for antibiotic coverage.
.
Review of Systems: Negative in detail including no CP, SOB, DOE,
edema, orthopnea, N/V or diaphoresis.

EKG ([**2112-1-29**]): Sinus rhythm at a rate of 68. Normal axis.
Normal intervals. Downgoing T's in III and aVF. No acute ST or T
wave changes. No prior for comparison.

Rhythm strip from [**Hospital **] Hospital ([**2112-1-29**] 16:24): Atrial
tachycardia at 150.

CT head/C-spine ([**2112-1-29**]): No intracranial process, no C-spine
fracture. Fluid within the nasal cavity and some layering within
the sinuses.

CXR ([**2112-1-29**]): Retrocardiac opacities on the left representing
either aspiration, atelectasis, or pneumonia.

[**2112-11-30**] EEG:
Abnormal portable EEG due to the widespread monotonous
alpha background. This suggests medication effect as the most
common
cause of such records. There were no areas of prominent focal
slowing,
and there were no epileptiform features.

[**2112-12-5**] EEG
This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the low voltage,
disorganized and poorly modulated background, consisting mainly
of a
faster beta frequency rhythm, likely reflecting medication
effects from
benzodiazepine or barbiturate administration. Findings are
consistent
with a moderate encephalopathy, suggestive of dysfunction of
bilateral
subcortical or deep midline structures. Medications, metabolic
disturbances, infection, and anoxia are among the common causes
of
encephalopathy. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing.
Several episodes of lower extremity tremulousness were noted by
the EEG
technician; no associated epileptiform features were noted. No
electrographic seizure activity was noted.

[**2112-2-6**] MRI Brain:
1.  Low ADC is identified in the white matter of
parietooccipital lobes and temporal lobes, suspicious for a
hypoxic injury.
2.  The exact nature of the increased signal identified in the
basal ganglia on ADC map and FLAIR is unclear but could be also
due to hypoxic injury.
3.  Enhancement along the sulci and also in the basal ganglia
region could be secondary to meningitis or meningeal
inflammation from other causes.  Clinical correlation is
recommended.
4.  Extensive paranasal sinus changes as described above.

Brief Hospital Course:
CARDIAC ARREST:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14887**] is a 49 yo M with a history of EtOH and prescription
drug abuse, who was found unresponsive at home by his mother.
EMS was called and thought Mr. [**Known lastname 14887**] was in VF asystole vs. VF
and received epinephrine and atropine x3 followed by
cardioversion with return to sinus rhythm. The patient was
intubated and sedated in the field and brought to [**Hospital **]
Hospital prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. There was concern for
intentional overdose as a cause of his arrest; however, tox
screen was notable only for EtOH level in the 200's at the OSH.
TSH was normal.  CXR revealed left-sided retrocardiac opacity
concerning for aspiration and in light of leukocytosis, the
patient was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole for
antibiotic coverage.  It is likely that hypoxia, possibly from
the aspiration, led to a cardiac arrest.  He was also found to
be hypokalemic on admission, which may have also contributed to
cardiac arrest.

ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:
In the ED the patient was initiated on a cooling protocol.
Neurology was consulted to advise on prognosis, but his acute
febrile illness made it difficult to prognosticate long-term
function from the cardiac arrest. He remained intubated and
sedated on propofol from admission to [**2112-12-7**], at which point
his sedation was changed to fentanyl/versed.

EEG on [**2112-1-31**] revealed widespread m
