History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
88F with CAD, 3VD, DM2, CRI, p/w  Clostridium difficile
diarrhea. Patient notes 2 week history of diarrhea assoicated
with cramps. No f/c/ns. No hematochezia or melena. Patient also
notes 2 to 3 days of weakness. There was no focal numbness or
weakness, described as more generalized weakness involving her
legs. She started on 14 day course of antibiotics during her
last admission for aspiration pneumonia, initially levofloxacin
and clindamycin then changed to azithromycin/clindamycin on
discharge. Last dose of antibiotics was scheduled for [**2144-4-25**].
The patient was also started on a 7 day course of levofloxacin
for a UTI initiated on [**2144-4-20**]. The patient had a stool sample
taken [**5-13**] that was positive for C.difficile and her pcp referred
her into the emergency department for persistent diarrhea. The
patient had taken one Immodium and one dose of metronidazole
last evening.

On ROS she denies orthopnea or PND. She has increased lower
extremity edema since her rehab. The Pts 2 daughters notes
increased salt and sugar in her diet at rehab as she was not on
restrictions.  She also noted no cough, shortness of breath. She
admits to increased irritation with urination but no dysuria or
hematuria.

   In the ED she was febrile with a temperature of 102.3F, HR
87, BP 94/47, RR 18, and O2 sat of 95% (supplemental oxygen not
recorded). BCX's were taken. A CXR demonstrated increased
interstitial opacities of the right lung with bilateral pleural
effusions felt consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema. She
received 2 liters of normal saline.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression:
88 year old female with C.difficile diarrhea secondary to
antibiotics use for pneumonia and dehydration.

1. Infectious Diarrhea. Positive culture for C.diff as
outpatient (s/p treatment with clindamycin for aspiration
pneumonia), now down to one stool since yesterday afternoon. WBC
32K with a bandemia. She did take one dose of immodium last
night (night prior to admission), no further doses of
medications that will decrease gut motility. Followup on KUB
that was taken in the ED to evaluate for megacolon; this showed
some thickening of the colon.  She was initially started on PO
flagyl, and her WBC count increased to 40,000 on this therapy.
She was switched to IV flagyl and PO vancomycin.  CT scan of the
abdomen was obtained which showed thickening throughout the
colon with some stranding, but no abscess, toxic megacolon, or
perforation.  Her WBC remained elevated, and she continued to
have copious amounts of liquidy stool.  She was transferred to
the ICU on [**5-18**] for closer monitoring given her lack of clinical
improvement.

In the ICU, fluid resuscitation was continued (4L); central line
was inserted with CVP's slightly elevated at 14.  Pressors were
then tried (initially levophed and then vasopressin) without
effect.  The family decided that she would be CMO, and pressors
were stopped. She expired soon thereafter.

2. Dehydration. Received 2 liters of normal saline in the
emergency department. Now on exam there may be a component of
left heart failure with bibasilar rales. Patient is TBW
overloaded with lower extremity edema (it is unusual for her to
have LE edema and none noted on her admission exam last month).
Fluids were initially given carefully (concern for 3rd spacing
with history of CHF), but she developed hypotension (systolics
to the 70-80's).  She was given multiple fluid boluses without
improvement in blood pressure (lasix held).  Due to inability to
maintain adequate blood pressure, she was transferred to the ICU
for further monitoring.  As above, fluids and pressors were used
without success (also received PRBC initially upon transfer).

3.  ARF: Creatinine at baseline was 1.3-1.6.  Her creatinine
continued to rise and was 3.4 at time of transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (with
minimal urine output).  Cause of this was thought to be a
combination of prerenal azotemia (FeNa calculated as 0.3%) and
secondary to dye nephropathy (got CT scan on [**5-16**] with IV
contrast, did receive IVF prior to scan).  Creatinine continued
to rise, and she expired from presumed sepsis as above (blood
pressure without response to fluids and pressors).

4. CHF. LVEF from [**1-11**] is 45%, unclear if her systolic
dysfunction has progressed. CXR today with possible asymmetric
right sided pulmonary edema. Patient with excellent oxygen
saturation on 2L NC initially.  When bolused for low SBP's, she
continued to accumulate peripheral edema.  Repeat TTE showed
EF=60% with 1-2+ MR.  As above, CVP was somewhat elevated when
measured in the ICU (?diastolic dysfunction).

5. Palpitations. Patient has a history of palpitations and was
on a KOH monitor as an outpatient. She was initially monitored
on telemetry with no events.

6. Code status: on discussion with patient and her daughter, it
was decided that that she did not want untubation or
compressions but would get shocks if necessary.  This was
maintained upon transfer to the ICU.  When fluid resuscitation
and pressors were ineffective, she was made CMO and expired in
the ICU.
