History of Present Illness:
68 yo M with h/o PE on coumadin, presents with a chief complaint

what he thought was a cold, but symptoms worsened with cough
productive of sputum varying between clear, yellow, brown.
Endorses subjective fever, sweats. Endorses DOE with running to
bus. He also
notes hoarse voice for 3-4 days. His pharmacist advised

coughing spells. No PND or orthopnea. Does endorse receiving flu
vaccine this year.
The pt was seen in urgent care at [**Hospital 191**] clinic on [**2186-1-4**], was
found to have a "faint opacity over the right lower lobe and
left lower lung worrisome for developing pneumonia" on CXR and
was given scripts for Levaquin and an albuterol inhaler. When

98% 8L NRB. Labs were notable for a Cr of 2.8, up from baseline
of 1.8-2. Pt was given vanc/cefepime, 4L NS, and admitted for VQ
scan to rule out PE. Vital signs on transfer were: 101 117
104/56 26 93%4L.

are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no

Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo M with presents with respiratory distress, likely due to
influenza versus atypical pneumonia.
.
Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 431**] presented in respiratory distress that was determined
to be a combination of pneumonia and possible CHF exacerbation.
He had a short stay in the MICU for the respiratory distress,
where he had a negative V/Q scan and LE dopplers which ruled him
out for PE. Echocardiogram was within normal limits. He was
treated in house with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin.
 Prior to discharge, his antibiotics were transferred to
cefodoxime/azithromycin.  He will complete a 10 day course.  His
coumadin was adjusted due to his concurrent use of antibiotics.
His HTN was treated with lisinopril, nifedipine, and Lasix.  His
Anemia was monitored and was maintained at baseline throughout.
He was discharged in stable condition.
