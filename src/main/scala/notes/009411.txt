Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, Dyspnea on exertion


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2135-10-31**]:
redo sternotomy/Mitral Valve annuloplasty with 28 mm  ring,


History of Present Illness:
72 yo male with prior cardiac history significant for an aortic
valve replacement in [**2123**] and device closure of a patent foramen
ovale in [**2127**] who was hospitalized in [**2135-7-7**] for acute
congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram at that time revealed
severe mitral regurgitation which was worse than his prior
echocardiogram. Of note, his hematocrit was found to be 25%
however workup was only notable for mild gastritis. Protonix was
subsequently started. Given the severity of his mitral
regurgitation and progression of his failure symptoms, Mr.
[**Known lastname 72001**] was referred for surgical evaluation.

The left atrium is moderately dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen
in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. A septal occluder
device is seen across the interatrial septum. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. A mechanical
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There a dilated mitral annulus (4.4 cm)
and a restricted posterior leaflet, with malcoaptation seen most
prominently at P3 cusp.

Post Bypass: Patient is paced on epinepherine, milrinone and
phenylepherine infusions.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

CXR:
[**2135-11-1**]: FINDINGS: Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes and chest
tube have been removed. No evidence of pneumothorax. Bibasilar
atelectasis and effusion, more prominent on the left, persists.
Small amount of pericardial or mediastinal gas is again seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**10-30**] for IV heparin /PATs and underwent surgery with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**10-31**]. Transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition on propofol, milrinone, insulin, and epinephrine
drips. Extubated and transferred to the floor on POD #1 to begin
increasing his activity level. Chest tubes and pacing wires
removed per protocol. Gently diuresed toward his preop weight.
Continued to make good progress and was cleared for discharge to
home with VNA on [**2135-11-5**]. All followup appts were advised.
