Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1042**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Mechanical Ventilation
Arterial Line Placement

History of Present Illness:
80 M with hx CAD s/p CABG presents with cough and SOB. The
patient reports that about a week ago he went to [**Country 4754**] for the
funeral of his brother. There he had fever/chills, and a
productive cough as well as rhinorrhea for the last week. He
decided to come back one week earlier and came back yesterday.
TOday his SOB worsened and he decided to come into the hospital.
He denied CP, pedal edema or calf pain.

In the ED, the patient was hypoxic to 81% on RA on arrival.
Other vitals included T 98.1, 71, 190/89, RR20. A CXR was done
with no significant infiltrates. A CTA was performed without PE
or infiltrate. The patient was then noted to be progressivley
more wheezing and short of breath. He was given several nebs
back to back with initial improvement but then continued with
laboured breathing. Methylprednisolone 125mg was given x1 and
Levofloxacin 750mg. The pt appeared progressively more tired and
in respiratory distress. A gas showed pH 6.93 pCO2 132 pO2 113.
THe patient was intubated with succinylcholin, etomidate and
ativan. Lactate was 1.2. He received a total of 2L of NS. Repeat
ABG: pH 7.14 pCO2 69 pO2 83.

ROS: pt intubated and sedated, unable to obtain. According to
nurse, pt received a double dose of his Atenolol today

Pertinent Results:

.
CXR: Single upright frontal bedside chest radiograph is compared
to [**2101-11-1**].  The lungs are clear.  The heart,
mediastinal contours, and pulmonary vasculature are unchanged in
appearance, remarkable for tortuous aorta.  The patient is
status post CABG.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  The pulmonary arteries opacify without
filling defects.  The patient is status post CABG, and there are
marked coronary artery calcifications within the LAD and
circumflex.  The heart appears normal.  There are multiple small
right hilar lymph nodes as well as a more prominent 12 mm lymph
node.  There is no pathologic mediastinal or axillary
adenopathy.  There is emphysema of the lungs, but lungs are
otherwise clear.  Note is made of a tiny calcified granuloma in
the right base.  There is no pleural effusion.  The airways are
patent to the subsegmental level.  There are multilevel
degenerative changes in the osseous structures.  The patient is
status post median sternotomy.  No suspicious lesions are
identified.  The visualized portions of the abdomen are
unremarkable.  There is atherosclerotic disease of the aorta
with multiple areas of mural thrombus.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence for pulmonary embolism.
2.  Emphysema, but no evidence for pneumonia.
.
CT HEAD [**2102-4-11**] COMPARISON STUDY: [**2102-4-1**], head CT scan,
also performed for a history of mental status changes,
interpreted by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] as revealing "No acute
intracranial abnormalities detected. Unchanged expansile osseous
lesion consistent with an osseous hemangioma. Destruction of the
outer table suggests aggressive potential and further evaluation
is indicated."
FINDINGS: The images of the posterior fossa region are mildly
degraded by patient motion, although a repeat imaging sequence
is of reasonably good diagnostic quality in this region.
There is no definite interval change in either the appearance of
the brain or osseous lesion in the one-week interval between
scans. There is no intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally
midline structures observed.
CONCLUSION: Stable, abnormal study as noted above. If acute
brain ischemia is a clinical consideration, MRI scanning, if
feasible, is a more sensitive diagnostic modality.
.
CHEST CT [**2102-4-17**]
1. Two 3-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodules. Statistically,
these are most likely benign. However, given the patient's
history, followup CT in three to six months can be obtained if
clinically warranted to exclude an atypical distribution of
small metastases.
2. New bilateral lower lobe dependent centrilobular opacities
most likely secondary to aspiration or infectious bronchiolitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 80 y.o. M with CAD s/p CABG, PVD & COPD who p/w hypercarbic
respiratory failure, likely [**2-18**] COPD exacerbation and flu, with
hospital stay complicated by DTs and prolonged AMS after being
off sedation.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt presented with profound
acidosis [**2-18**] hypercarbic resp failure and was intubated, found
to have influenza complicated by newly diagnosed COPD. CT
consistent with emphysema and long standing tobacco abuse make
diagnosis very likely in the abscence of PFTs. Pt was extubated
after 5 days but required reintubation [**2-18**] recurrent hypercarbic
resp failure in setting of significant valium administration and
MS depression.  Second intubation course was prolonged due to
depressed MS and likely delayed clearance of benzodiazpines.
Pulm status has been stable since extubation on standing nebs,
guaifenesin & pulm toilet. Pt has been afebrile, sating well on
RA and secretions have decreased with mobilization. Repeat Chest
CT was performed to evaluate for metastatic disease from left
frontal osteohemangioma.  CT reported 2 X 3mm pulm nodules that
will require a follow up CT in 6mths but were thought to be
likely benign.  Centrilobar opacities likely c/w aspiration that
have been clinically silent and may be residual from repeat
intubations. Pt will need to complete last three days of
Prednisone taper, Albuterol & Atrovent nebs & Gua
