Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2137-12-28**]  8:54:32 PM
Sinus rhythm. Left anterior fascicular block. Inferolateral T
wave
abnormalities are non-specific but cannot exclude ischemia.
Since the previous
tracing of [**2137-12-17**] sinus bradycardia is absent. Clinical
correlation is
suggested.

[**12-28**] CXR
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia. Probable trace right
pleural effusion.

[**12-31**] TTE
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral wall.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-13**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2135**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

[**2138-1-1**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
one vessel CAD. The LMCA, LAD and LCX had no angiographically
apparent
flow limiting disease. The RCA had a calcified ostial 95% lesion
with
left to right collaterals to the distal RCA.
2.  Successful rotational atheretomy, PTCA and stenting of the
ostial
RCA with two overlapping Cypher (3x18mm distal; 3.5x13mm) drug
eluting
stents postdilated distally with a 3.25mm balloon and 3.5mm
balloon
proximally.  Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically
apparent
dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout
the vessel
(See PTCA comments).
3.  Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with a Mynx
closure device.
4. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated systemic arterial
hypertension, with BP of 180/72 mmHg.
5. Left ventriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful rotational atheretomy, PTCA and stenting of the
ostial RCA
with two overlapping Cypher drug eluting stents.
3. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with
a Mynx
closure device.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 80042**] is an 84 year old woman with history of CAD,
systolic heart failure, presenting with complaint of chest pain.

.
# NSTEMI: Patient with complaints of chest pain the day of
admission.  She was chest pain free after SL nitro.  She ruled
in for NSTEMI with a peak Trop of 0.38.  She was started on
heparin and integrelin gtt. She was also given ASA 325, plavix
loaded with 600mg and continued on 75mg daily, and continued her
BB.  She remained chest pain free thoughout her admission.  She
underwent cardiac cath on [**1-1**] and showed One vessel coronary
artery disease with 95 % occluded proximal RCA. She then
underwent successful rotational atheretomy, PTCA and stenting of
the ostial RCA
with two overlapping Cypher drug eluting stents as well as
successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with a
Mynx closure device. She will plan on long-term Plavix therapy.
.
# CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: The patient underwent ECHO on
[**12-31**] and showed an EF 50%.  She was continued on her BB and [**Last Name (un) **]
therapy.
.
# HYPERTENSION: Pt with labile blood pressures during her stay.
Her BP would be elevated into SBP 150's later in the evening.
Her valsartan was changed to noon time dosing to improve evening
pressures. Her BP improved with the adjustment. She was
continued on Diltiazem, Isosorbide, Metoprolol, and valsartan.
.
# Diabetes: She is diet controlled. Her AM glucose has been
