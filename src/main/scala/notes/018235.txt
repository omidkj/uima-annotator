Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 710**]
Chief Complaint:
Back Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ir-Guided embolization and stenting of right vertebral branch of
aorta

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75F aith newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation s/p
cardioversion and coumadin initiation with lovenox bridge
discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-9**] who returned to the ED this morning
with spontaneous RP bleed. Pt had been discharged on [**11-9**] to a
nursing home following her admission with the goal of trying to
improve her strength and conditioning. She developed right-sided
low back pain yesterday. The morning she was noted to be pale
and unresponsive and was transferred back to [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the ED, intitial vitals 99.4 130/50 62 20 99%RA. Hematocrit
was 24.4 down from 29 on [**11-9**]. CT scan showed large
retorperitoneal bleed. Head CT negative for acute intracranial
process. Cardiac enzymes negative x1. EKG unchanged from
baseline. Pt was guaiac negative. Pt was given 10mg Vitamin K
IV, 1L NS amd transfused 2 units FFP. She was transferred to IR
for embolization. There she developed hives consistent with a
transfusion reaction to the FFP. The FFP was stopped and the
patient was given 25mg benadryl IV with resolution of her
symptoms. Aortogram showed active bleed from right L4 lumbar
branch bleed, embolized 2 branches with gel foam and 2 coils
each.
.
On arrival to the ICU, vitals 100.1 80 115/62 18 97% 2L. Pt's
primary complaints are of thirst and discomfort from having to
be on her back. She denies current abdominal or back pain, chest
pain, nausea, diarrhea, or shortness of breath.

CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Stable age-related atrophic changes.

CXR admission [**2161-11-13**]:
Bilateral pleural effusions with lower lobe compressive
atelectasis.

CXR [**2161-11-15**]:
Moderate to large right pleural effusion has increased in
amount. Small left
pleural effusion also has increased. Bibasilar opacities right
greater than
left consistent with atelectasis have increased. Mild
interstitial edema is
new. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated.


CXR [**2161-11-18**]:
comparison with the study of [**11-15**], there is continued evidence
of _____ pleural effusions, more prominent on the right.
However, the degree
of adjacent atelectasis has decreased and the pulmonary
vascularity is now
essentially within normal limits.

Chemoembolization:
[**2161-11-13**]
1. Aortogram demonstrated active extravasation of contrast from
branches of
the right fourth lumbar artery.

2. Selective catheterization of right fourth lumbar artery with
successful
embolization using Gelfoam slurry and microcoils.

CT Abd/Pelvis:
1. Large right retroperitoneal hematoma likely secondary to
right psoas
hematoma with rupture. Areas of active bleeding noted in the
right
retroperitoneal space, for which catheter embolization is
suggested.

2. Left retroperitoneal hematoma may be secondary to bleeding
from the left
psoas muscle which is also heterogeneously enlarged.

3. Left rectus sheath hematoma.

4. Cholelithiasis.

5. Renal and liver hypodensities, incompletely characterized,
though may
represent cysts.

6. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

7. Right adnexal cyst, for which pelvic ultrasound is
recommended to further
assess on a non-emergent basis.

8. Bilateral moderate-sized simple-appearing pleural effusions
with
associated lower lobe compressive atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
RP Bleed - Spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of
new coumadin/lovenox therapy following cardioversion for atrial
fibrillation. Initial INR 2.1, got 2 units FFP and 10mg IV
Vitamin K. Underwent IR-guided embolization of right fourth
lumbar artery on [**11-13**]. Hct 19% on arrival to ICU, improved to
26% after 2U PRBC. Coumadin, lovenox, aspirin held.   Hematocrit
remained stable at 28% through the remainder of her stay.
.
Hypoxia. - On arrival to the floor, patient was tachypneic with
a respiratory rate of 28, and had an oxygen saturation of 86% of
3L.  A chest x-ray demonstrated worsening pleural effusions.
She was given IV lasix and returned to the MICU.  With diuresis
her breathing and oxygen saturation improved.  She was
discharged on her home dose of lasix.
.
Orthostatic Hypotension.  Patient's blood pressure was volatile
during this admission, with SBP varying from 80-200, depending
on position and time of day.  She had one hypotensive episode of
80/50.  She was laid supine and her pressure came up to 110/60.
She was given 250cc NS bolus, and her lasix was reduced to her
home dose of 20mg PO daily.  The timing of her lisinopril
administraton was changed to qhs.  Her blood pressure remained
stable after these medication changes.
.
Atrial Fibrillation - Discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-9**] following
cardioversion. Put on coumadin with lovenox bridge (both held on
admission, as above). Continued amiodarone 400mg daily. Her dose
of metoprolol was decreased to 25mg PO bid.  On telemetry, she
was in normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 70-90.  She did have
several episodes of atrial fibrillation with a rate in the
70s-80s, during which she was asymptommatic.
.
Diarrhea - Pt had 2 episodes of loose stools upon arriving to
the hospital and Clostridium difficile was ruled out.
.
Depression - Her dose of sertraline was increased to 25mg.
.
Anxiety disorder- Her ativan was continued at her home dosing.

.
Parkinsonism/dementia - Continued sinemet.
.
FEN - She was evaluated by speech/swallow, who recommended a
ground dysphagia diet and nectar thickened liquids.  A video
swallow study showed no abnormalities and she was advanced to
soft solids/thin liquids.
