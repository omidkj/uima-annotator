HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 39-year-old African-
American female with history of HIV, whose last CD4 count is
approximately 260 with a viral load of less than 50, end-stage
renal disease secondary to HIV nephropathy, who presents with
fever and hypotension.  The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 1444**] for right middle lobe pneumonia
several weeks prior to admission. She was discharged on a 10 day
course of levofloxacin followed by a five day course of
azithromycin.

Several days prior to admission, patient also experienced a
seizure.  A lumbar puncture and MRI were both negative at this
time.  She states that she has not felt well since having a
seizure.  The patient was noted to be febrile in hemodialysis on
day of admission.  Patient presents to the Emergency Department
with complaints of increased generalized pain, dry cough, and
fever to 105.

Patient denies headaches, chest pains, sore throat, shortness of
breath, abdominal pain, rigors, lightheadedness, or sick contacts
at this time.  The patient does complain of pain in her left knee
and thigh.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Systolic blood pressure is 65,
heart rate in the 120s, temperature 101.5, oxygen saturation
of 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  In general, the patient
was alert, oriented, appearing fatigued, appropriately
conversing.  HEENT exam revealed pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.
Sclerae were anicteric.  The neck was supple with full range
of motion.  There is no lymphadenopathy noted.  Pulmonary
examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac
examination revealed a normal S1, S2, the rate was
tachycardic, there was a [**2-14**] holosystolic ejection murmur
throughout the precordium.  Abdomen was almost soft,
nontender, nondistended with positive reactive bowel sounds
in all four quadrants.  The back was negative.  There was no
costovertebral angle tenderness appreciated.  Extremities
were notable for 2+ distal pulses, were warm to touch.  There
is a failed A-V fistula in her left forearm with a working
fistula on the right side.  Neurologically, cranial nerves
were intact.  There are no focal deficits and the patient is
moving all extremities.

LABORATORIES:  White count was 9.3, hematocrit 36.8,
platelets of 136 with 86.5% polys, no bands, 9.2%
lymphocytes, 3.3% monocytes.  Chem-7 revealed a sodium of
139, potassium 4.2, chloride of 95, bicarb of 24, BUN 25,
creatinine of 6.3, and glucose of 120.  Blood cultures drawn
from [**3-1**] showed no growth to date.  CSF fluid from
[**2-28**] also was negative.

CHEST X-RAY:  Was clear.

ASSESSMENT:  Patient is a 39-year-old female with HIV, end-stage
renal disease, recent pneumonia, and new onset seizure, who
presents with fever, dry cough, and hypotension without
alteration in mental status.  Given patient's hypotension and
concern for sepsis:  The patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Hypotension:  Within three days of admission, the patient had
resolution of her hypotension.  Although the initial etiology was
thought to be secondary to sepsis, patient failed to develop
fever, white count, and all culture data remained negative. Thus,
it was thought that patient's presentation of hypotension was
indeed secondary to a clonidine patch that was unbeknownst at
time of admission. Upon initial admission to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, she required Neo-Synephrine.  The Neo-
Synephrine was weaned off within the first 24 hours of admission.

By hospital day #3, patient's hypotension resolved completely,
and she was transferred to the General Medicine floor.  The
patient remained hemodynamically throughout the remainder of her
hospital stay.

2. Infectious disease:  Given patient's immunocompromised status,
history of recurrent pneumonia and complaints of pleuritic chest
pain.  The patient was initially started on broad-spectrum
antibiotics to cover for possible sources of recurrent pneumonia.
The patient was initially treated with Vancomycin, ceftazidime,
and gentamicin for broad-spectrum coverage.

Given that patient's culture data remained negative, though with
continued right middle lobe consolidation on chest x-ray,
antibiotic therapy was adjusted to include only ceftazidime.
Thus, the Pulmonary Service was consulted for bronch.

Status post bronch, the patient did well and was discharged to
home on day after procedure.  The patient is to followup with PCP
with results of bronch.

Given persistent right middle lobe infiltrate on CT scan with
slight hemoptysis, Pulmonary was consulted.

3. HIV:  Patient was continued on HAART therapy throughout
this hospital stay without complication.

4. End-stage renal disease:  Patient continued to receive
hemodialysis as scheduled.  She is followed by Renal service
throughout this admission without any complications.  Given
negative blood cultures, there is no concern that her
presentation could be consistent of that of a line infection that
would possibly compromise her hemodialysis.

5. History of seizures:  Patient remained asymptomatic throughout
this hospital stay.
