Studies:
.
CT Head ([**3-3**]): 1. Right cerebellar parenchymal hemorrhage with
mild surrounding edema and mass effect upon the fourth
ventricle. 2. Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic change.
.
CTA Head ([**3-3**]): Unchanged right medial cerebellar hemispheric
hematoma. No
evidence of aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.
.
MRA Head and Neck ([**3-3**]): Right cerebellar hemispheric hematoma
again seen. There is minimal enhancement around the periphery
and slight vascular prominence. These findings may be related to
the hematoma itself, rather than revealing its etiology. If
there is clinical concern of a possible arteriovenous
malformation, a catheter arteriogram would be the most sensitive
study.
.
CT Head ([**3-6**]):  No significant change of the right cerebellar
parenchymal
hemorrhage with mild surrounding edema and mass effect upon the
fourth
ventricle.
.
TTE ([**3-7**]):  The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrial pressure is indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function.
.
CXR ([**3-9**]): Severe cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular
congestion are improved since early on [**3-8**], unchanged
since 9:40 p.m. that day. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion, if
any, is minimal.

Brief Hospital Course:
An 81 year-old woman with past history of atrial fibrillation,
CAD s/p recent stents presenting from OSH with cerebellar
hemorrhage in the setting of coumadin.
.
She was admitted initially to the neuro ICU. She was extubated
on [**3-4**] and her coumadin-induced coagulapathy was reversed with
FFP. She was transfered out of the ICU on [**2199-3-5**]. She was
started on vancomycin and Zosyn on [**3-4**] for question of LLL PNA.
She was also noted to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR and
diltiazem ggt was started for better rate control in the setting
of HR to the 150s. The drip was able to be stopped and changed
to po metoprolol and diltizem once stabilized and patient was
transferred to the floor on the morning of [**3-9**]. Floor course is
outlined by problem below.
.
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
As above, patient has a history of atrial fibrillation; she
developed RVR in the setting of fever and possible infection. A
TSH was checked that was normal. At time of transfer to the
medical floor, her rate was controlled with BB and CCB. However,
she intermittently had runs of RVR to the 140s, during which her
oxygen requirements increased and she became dyspneic. She was
given IV dilt prn and the oral diltiazem increased to achieve
better rate control. Metoprolol was stopped due to side effects
(patient said this caused "hallucinations"). At a dilt dose of
90 mg qid, adequate rate control was achieved during both rest
and exertion. With improved rate control, her oxygenation also
improved and she was able to be weaned off of O2. Her coumadin
has been held per neurology recs for at least two weeks. She
will follow-up in neurology clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] in one to two weeks
at which time coumadin may be restarted.
.
2. Cerebellar hemorrhage.
She underwent repeat head CT prior to transfer to floors; there
was no interval change. Neurology service continued to follow
and recommended for goal SBPs in the 120-160 range. They said it
was okay to continue clopidogrel and recommended holding
warfarin for at least two weeks after the cerebellar bleed. She
has follow-up scheduled in neurology clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
3. Fever.
There was question of LLL pneumonia and left pleural effusion at
time of transfer. She had no cough and there was no
leukocytosis. Given her hypoxia (likely related to RVR) at time
of transfer, we were not comfortable stopping the antibiotics.
She was continued on vancomycin and Zosyn for one day and this
switched to oral levofloxacin when her symptoms improved. She
will complete a 7-day course for presumptive HAP.
.
4. Left pleural effusion.
This was concerning for parapneumonic effusion in the setting of
fever.  Given her history of malignancy there was concern of
malignant effusion. Procedure service was consulted and
ultrasound imaging showed that there was not sufficient fluid
collection to drain. Furthermore, fluid appeared non-loculated,
layering out on decubitus films, and its appearance was felt to
be less likely consistent with empyema or malignant effusion.
Drainage was not attempted. The effusion resolved with
conservative measures and on repeat CXR was significantly
reduced in size.
.
5. Coronary artery disease s/p drug eluting stent.
We continued her outpatient clopidogrel and statin.
