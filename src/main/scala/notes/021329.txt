Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with stents x2 to OM1
Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty


History of Present Illness:
81M hx COPD presents with substernal chest pressure without
radiation or associated nausea/SOB/radiation since 4pm [**2-7**].
He presented to OSH on [**2-8**] AM with fairly continuous chest
pressure, which he has never experienced before, EKG without
ischemic changes but his tropI was 22.  He was given ASA 325,
plavix loaded and transferred on a heparin gtt for cath.
.
At cath, found to have critical AS with valve area 0.4 and 95%
OM1 lesion as probable culprit, with 40% LMCA ostial, 30% LAD,
70% mid LCx and a small nondominant RCA.  In setting of AS, no
intervention was undertaken for ?CT surgery intervention for AVR
and CABG.
.
He was transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring due to poor
hemodynamics with a CI of 1.8.  On arrival, he only complained
of baseline shortness of breath he attributes to his COPD.  He
was chest pain free.

PERTINENT STUDIES
CARDIAC CATH ([**2138-2-6**])
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated in this left
dominant
system demonstrated one vessel disease. The LMCA had 40% ostial
stenosis. The LAD had a mid 30% stenosis. The LCX had a mid 70%,
95%
major OM1. The RCA was small non dominant.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated right and left elevated
filling
pressures with RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 22 mmHg. The PCWP was
elevated at
baseline 16 mmHg. There was moderate pulmonary arterial
hypertension at
rest, with PASP 45 mmHg. the cardiac output was low, with CI
1.79
L/min/m2. There was severe aortic stenosis with peak gradient of
60 mmHg
and a calculated aortic valve of 0.4 cm2.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
3. Severe aortic stenosis.
.
CXR ([**2138-2-7**])
AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
Hyperinflation reflects COPD. No focal pulmonary abnormality.
Technical
artifact produces misregistration at the lung bases not to be
mistaken for
pneumothorax or other abnormality. There is no pleural effusion.

Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal aside from
atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta.
.
ECHO ([**2138-2-7**])
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
significant aortic valve stenosis. Peak and mean gradients place
AS in the moderate range, though precise calculation of valve
area is limited by technically-suboptimal LVOT jet velocity
measurement. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent
fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Very limited study. Normal global biventricular
systolic function. Aortic stenosis, probably moderate.
.
CHEST CT ([**2138-2-7**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Several bilateral pulmonary nodules, including dominant 8 and
10 mm right apical nodules. In the setting of apical scarring,
the apical nodules could potentially be due to nodular scarring.
However, in the setting of emphysema, PET-CT should be
considered for further evaluation in order to exclude a primary
lung cancer.
2. Mild-to-moderate centrilobular emphysema in the upper lobes.
Apparent
coexisting panlobular emphysema in lower lobes. Considering
coexisting
moderate bronchiectasis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency should
be considered.
3. Severe aortic valve and coronary artery calcifications.
4. Bilateral hypodense adrenal nodules, most consistent with
adenomas.
5. Anterior wedge compression fracture of vertebral body T12,
age
indeterminate, as no priors are available for comparison.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2138-2-9**]
Suboptimal image quality. Significant aortic stensosis.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-2-8**],
the peak transaortic velocity has increased from 2.8 m/s to 3.9
m/s and the peak transaortic pressure gradient has increased
from 32 mmHg to 60 mmHg. These findings are more consistent with
the visual appearance of the aortic valve with severely
thickened leaflets and limited leaflet mobility (at least severe
aortic stenosis visually and by velocities/transvalvular
gradients), however in the absence of a measurement of the LVOT
dimensions and a peak LVOT velocity tracing a definitive
measurement of the aortic valve area cannot be made.
.
CARDIAC CATHETERISATION [**2138-2-11**]
1. Severe aortic stenosis
2. Successful balloon valvuloplasty of aortic valve with 22mm
Tyshak II
balloon with improvement in SBP and gradient
3. Successful LFA angioseal.
4. Plan for PCI LCx later in week.
.
CAROTID ULTRASOUNDS [**2138-2-12**]
Study: Carotid Series Complete
Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On the right there is moderate heterogeneous plaque
seen in the ICA . On the left there is mild heterogeneous plaque
seen in the ICA.
On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and distal respectively are 120/24, 95/27, 106/16,
cm/sec. CCA peak systolic velocity is 106 cm/sec. ECA peak
systolic velocity is 196 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.1 .
These findings are consistent with 40-59% stenosis.

On the left systolic
