Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
sinus tachycardia, hypotension at dialysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
dialysis


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63yoF living at [**Hospital3 2558**] with multiple
medical problems (including DM, HTN, diastolic CHF,
hyperlipidemia, pulm HTN, ESRD on HD, h/o AV graft infections,
morbid obesity, lower extremity DVT, b/l IJ vein thromboses, and
OSA). She was at her regularly scheduled HD session this morning
when she was noted to be tachycardic to the 140's several hours
into treatment. She has remained asymptomatic during tx aside
from diaphoresis initially; she denies CP, palpitations, N/V,
anorexia, emesis, SOB, abd pain, HS, fever and diaphroesis
currently.
.
Of note, her baseline SBP is 100-10's. On presentation to the
ED, VS were T 98.9, BP 114/65, HR 142, RR 16, 100% on 2LNC. She
received lopressor 25 mg PO x 1 and lopressor 5 mg IV x 2 in the
ED, and then dropped her SBP to 80-90's. She then got 2L NS
which improved SBp to 90-100's but only brought her HR down to
120-130's.

CTA: CTA CHEST: Overall, evaluation is limited by patient
respiratory motion with particular limitation of segmental and
subsegmental branches to the lower lobes bilaterally. Allowing
for this, no central pulmonary embolism is seen.
Atherosclerotic calcifications involve the aortic arch and its
branches,
though they are of normal caliber. Cardiomegaly persists without
evidence for pericardial or pleural effusion. Atherosclerotic
coronary calcification is again observed. Scattered prominent
mediastinal nodes are noted, the largest paratracheal node
measuring up to 10 mm in short axis, smaller compared to
[**2136-9-17**] when it measured up to 13 mm. Calcifications in
the left thyroid are again partially imaged.
Lung windows reveal mild hypoventilatory changes at the lung
bases
bilaterally. An approximately 6-mm ground-glass nodule in the
left upper lobe (3:32) is not seen on the prior study. A 4 mm
nodule is in the right lower lobe (3:52).
Although this study is not tailored to evaluate abdominal
organs, limited
evaluation of the upper abdomen reveals tiny nonobstructing
renal calculi,
measuring up to 4 mm.
The surrounding osseous structures demonstrate multilevel
thoracolumbar
spondylosis. Endplate erosion and sclerotic change at T9/10
again may
represent sequelae of prior infection, unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited evaluation without evidence for central pulmonary
embolism.
2. Small nodules in the lower lobes bilaterally. If there is
history of
malignancy or risk factors for malignancy, follow-up in 6 months
is
recommended. Without such history, follow-up in one year is
advised.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process or signs of
CHF.

ECG: Probable sinus tachycardia. Left anterior fascicular block.
Poor R wave progression. Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-10-5**] sinus tachycardia is
new.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 yoF with MMP on HD, p/w SVT to the 140's during HD today in
the setting of reportedly 5-6L removal.
.
#. TACHYCARDIA: Occured while on dialysis in the setting of
fluid removal. Now controlled on oral medications. [**Month (only) 116**] have been
initiated by volume removal, however likely has an abberant
atrial focus for her tachydardia. Not a candidate for ablation
per EP.  Her heart rate was controlled witdiltieazem and
lopressor.  She has baseline low blood pressures but remained
stable.  She was anticoagulated with coumadin.  Her INR was 3.8
on day of discharge and was held.  Her INR should checked the
next day and pending those results her coumadin should be
restarted at an appropriate dose.
.
#. H/O THORMBOSES, ANTICOAGULATION: Multiple venous thrombosis.
Coumadin was continued.  Goal INR of [**2-19**].
.
#. ESRD, [**2-18**] DM: on HD T-Th-Sat.  HD was continued in house with
no futher episodes of tachycardia.  Less fluid was taken off
overall with HD as it was thought that may have instigated her
tachcardia.  She may require a longer dialysis time to take off
fluid.  Her renal medications were continued and she recieved
bactrim and epo with dialysis.
.
#. DEPRESSION:  Her paxil was continued.
.
#. GERD:  Her protonix was continued.
.
#. CARDIAC DISEASE: ASA 81 mg QD
.
#. DM:  NPH 20 units QAM + SSI
.
#. FEN: renal diet; con folic acid, B12, Vit C, zinc
.
#. PPX:
- PO PPI
- systemmic antocoaglulation with coumadin (see above)
- bowel regimen with senna, colace
.
#. ACCESS: PIV, left tunneled HD catheter
.
