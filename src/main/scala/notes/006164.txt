[**2173-1-18**] Emergent coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with a left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery. A

obtuse marginal artery.


History of Present Illness:
58 year old gentleman with hypertension, hyperlipidemia and
diabetes has a history of CAD, s/p MI and reportedly underwent
coronary stenting in [**2163**] at [**Hospital 794**] Hospital. Details of this
procedure are not currently available.

For the last 3 months, he has been experiencing symptoms of
diaphoresis and pain in the left shoulder as well as chest
pressure. These episodes have occurred at rest, lasting for
about 1 hour at a time, subsiding on their own.  He denies any
symptoms occurring with activity and actually works in pizza
delivery and has no problems carrying the pizza.

Pertinent Results:
2/110 - ECHO
Pre-bypass:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There is an
intraaortic balloon visualized in the descending thoracic aorta
with the tip of the balloon at the level of the left subclavian
artery. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-bypass:
The patient is not receiving inotropic support post-CPB.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved and similar to
pre-bypass findings. All other findings are consistent with
pre-bypass findings. The aorta is intact post-decannulation. All
findings discussed with the surgical team. The intraaortic
balloon is approximately 3 cm distal from the left subclavian
artery.

[**2173-1-18**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
three
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a 95% distal
stenosis. The
LAD was occluded in the mid-vessel and filled by right to left
collaterals. The LCx was diffusely diseased. The RCA had
moderate
disease diffusely.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial blood
pressure (SBP 121 mm Hg).
3. An 8F 40 cc IABP was placed via the right femoral artery
without
complications.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel and left main coronary artery disease.
2. Placement of IABP.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 85849**] presented for cardiac catheterization and was found
to have a tight left main lesion. An intra-aortic balloon pump
was placed in the cardiac catheterization lab and he was then
transferred to the operating room for emergent coronary artery
bypass graft surgery. Please see operative report for further
details. He received cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics and
was transferred to the intensive care unit for post operative
management.  In the first twenty four hours the intra aortic
balloon pump was removed, he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without complications.
He remained in the intensive care unit for pulmonary monitoring
and on post operative day two was transferred to the floor.
Physical therapy worked with him on strength and mobility. He
was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. He
continued to progress and was ready for discharge home with
services on post operative day 4. He will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6700**] as an outpatient.
