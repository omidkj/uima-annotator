Noncontrast head CT [**2190-2-25**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. No fractures
identified.

Cervical spine CT:
1. No acute cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
2. Nonspecific groundglass opacities at the lung apices,
potentially
infectious or inflammatory in nature. Additional imaging by
chest CT can be performed as clinically warranted

EGD
Impression: Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis
(biopsy)
Normal mucosa in the esophagus (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: follow-up biopsy results

RUQ US
1. No gallstones and no biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is
mildly
contracted.
2. Mildly echogenic liver consistent with mild fatty
infiltration. Other
forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis can't be excluded on this
study.

[**2190-3-5**] Upper GI series

IMPRESSION: Severe esophageal spasm occurring after a few
swallowing attempts
with associated occurrence of intense symptoms of chest pain and
nausea.


Brief Hospital Course:
50yoM with etoh abuse, heroin abuse, hep C, depression, asthma,
admitted for alcohol intoxication and found to have diffuse
esophageal spasm

# Ethanol abuse - admitted for obtundation [**12-24**] intoxication.
Intubated in ED for airway protection, admitted to ICU. Self
extubated later that day ([**2190-2-25**]). Was started on CIWA protocol,
weaned off with last dose of benzos on [**2-27**].  See below in
"psych" section re alcohol treatment and disposition.

# pulmonary- intubated [**2-25**] and self extubated later that day.
Had some residual throat and R anterior neck pain without any
evidence of perforation/infection.  Developed productive cough
and wheezing; CXR clear, not felt to be pneumonia; was treated
w/ nebulized bronchodilators with good effect.

# dyspepsia/dysphagia- after extubation, hospital discharge was
delayed by inability to advance diet. Pt had epigastric pain and
vomiting with small quantities of liquid and solid foods. Also
reported chronic dysphagia. Underwent EGD which showed mild
gastritis. Underwent RUQ US which showed fatty infiltration,
could not exclude cirrhosis (known hep C).  Underwent barium
swallow and small bowel follow through which showed severe
esophageal spasm, which is felt to be the etiology of his
symptoms.  The patient was started on 30 mg po diltiazem and his
symptoms improved somewhat and was able to tolerate liquids
only.  He has a baseline low BP and as a result we cautiously
titrated up his diltiazem to 60 QID.  This resulted in
significant improvement and ability to toelrate a full diet with
minimal to no symptoms of pre-syncope or orthostasis.  He was
instructed to go slow when he got out of bed to a sitting or
standing position and staying hydrated to avoid falls.
Imipramine is contraindicated in this patient due to psychiatric
issues and the patient is unable to tolerate trazadone.  The
patient needs to follow up with GI for esophageal manometry.
The patient will also be continued on a PPI for gastritis
.
# hx of depression w/ suicidal ideation in past.
During hospital stay, became very frustrated and on [**3-4**] Code
Purple was called for suicidal thoughts. Psychiatry involved. Pt
felt to have a resolving toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from his
alcohol, along with some component of opiate withdrawal (was on
suboxone) on top of mood disorder.  On 1:1 sitter and does not
lack capacity to leave AMA.  During the last several days of his
stay, he denied SI's or HI's but did intermittently refuse care
and tore out his IV twice.  Finally, the patient was agreed to
go to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 9231**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], a dual diagnosis unit.  The patient was
sent out on half dose of zoloft (50 mg PO QD), symptoms of GI
upset should be monitored for.  The rest of his psychiatric
medications were continued from his outpatient providers list
except baclofen.
.
# HCV
Patient has over 22 million copies of HCV RNA and has genotype
1B.  He should have follow up with a Liver physician to consider
treatment for this
.
# finger lesion
Cigarette burn noted on R index finger between PIP and DIP.
bacitracin ointment and dressings given.  Given decreased
ability to make fist, may need outpatient hand [**Doctor First Name **] c/s or hand
OT to avoid long term disability.
.
# trauma- In the ED he was evaluated traumatic injuries and
placed in a cervical collar.  CT head and neck that were both
unremarkable; C-spine was cleared and collar removed.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- outpatient hepatology f/u appointment
- consider outpatient hand [**Doctor First Name **] eval for burn on index finger
- EGD biopsies [**3-3**] wnl
- GI recommends outpatient esophageal manometry

Medications on Admission:
-Suboxone 16mg - 8mg am, 8mg pm
-Baclofen 10mg [**Hospital1 **]
-Atarax 50mg up to 3 tabs daily prn
