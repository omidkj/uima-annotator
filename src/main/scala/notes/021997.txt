Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness

Reason for MICU transfer: Bilateral pulmonary embolus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2175-2-14**]: Placement of IVC filter under IR guidance
[**2-14**]/27, [**2175**]: esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
This is an 86 year old female with PMH significant for CAD (no
prior stents or MI), hypothyodism, recent history of esophageal
ulceration s/p endoclips on [**2175-2-6**] who is transferred from OSH
for management of bilateral pulmonary emboli in the setting of
recent GI bleed.
.
Patient was in her usual state of health until [**2175-2-6**], when she
was admitted to the ICU at [**Hospital6 17032**] for
hemoptysis. Hct at that time was 21. EGD demonstrated a large
superficial ulceration in the distal esophagus adjacent to the
squamocolumnar junction with a central adherent clot and visible
vessels. The ulceration site was managed with endoscopic clip
placement and epinephrine injection. She was given 4 units
prbcs. Repeat EGD was performed 2days later without active
bleeding. Her ulcerations were attributed to 4 pills of advil
TID, fosamax, and recent initiation of full dose aspirin for her
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
.
Earlier this evening, patient felt was sitting on the toilet
when she felt suddently weak, dizzy, and faint. She also
developed acute onset shortness of breath. No chest pain or
palpitations. She was taken by ambulance to [**Hospital3 18201**], where workup notable for systolic blood
pressures in the 80s-90s with tachycardia to the 130s. Noted to
have a troponin level of 0.1 and a new RBBB (last ECG in [**Hospital1 **]
system in [**2161**]). CTA demonstrated large bilateral pulmonary
embolus. She was given 3L NS with improvement in SBPs to the
110s and heart rates in the 110s. Given protonix 40mg IV X 1.
Was transferred here for IR evaluation of thrombectomy given
recent GI bleed and concern for initiation of systemic
anticoagulation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were 96.2, HR: 109, BP:
108/74, RR: 26, O2sat: 91% RA. Labs notable for hematocrit of
30.6, creatinine of 1.3. Trop of 0.23 with CK 76 and a MB of 5.
Patient was given an additional 2L NS with stabilization of
tachycardia and blood pressures. Also given ativan 0.5 mg IV X
1. ECG demonstrated RBBB morphology with T wave inversions in
precordial leads with ST depressions in V4-V6. Cardiology
service initially consulted, believed ECG changes and troponin
leak due to RV strain and demand ischemia. IR service also
consulted who did not recommend urgent intervention at this
time. Patient was guiac negative, NG lavage was negative, and IV
heparin with no bolus was initiated. She was transferred to the
MICU for further management. Last set of vitals were: HR: 95,
BP: 127/76, RR: 27, O2sat: 95%2L.
.
Upon reaching the floor, patient reports that her breathing is
now back to normal and is without acute complaints.

# Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli: Patient presented to [**Hospital **] [**2175-2-13**] with dyspnea and was found to be hypotensive,
and tachycardic.  CTA showed BL pulmonary embolism. She was
started on heparin drip and transferred to the ICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for
management of hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism, in
the setting of recent upper GI bleed. The day after transfer,
patient had a drop in her hematocrit and was found to have
recurrent GI bleed. Heparin was discontinued  (total of 18 hours
on drip). The bleed was managed as below and further
anticoagulation was avoided given severity of the bleed. An IVC
filter was placed on [**2-14**]. She was electively intubated for
approx 18 hours for EGD and IVC filter placement (and code
status returned to DNR/DNI afterwards). She had transient
hypotension after intubation that was responsive to IVF and did
not recur after extubation on [**2-15**]. Transthoracic echocardiogram
revealed moderately dilated RV with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis, moderate
