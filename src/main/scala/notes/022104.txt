Admission Date:  [**2115-5-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2115-5-27**]

Date of Birth:   [**2062-12-24**]       Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old man
with diabetes type 1, for 40 years, complicated by
retinopathy with blindness, status post living donor kidney
transplant in [**2103**], status post bilateral BKAs with recent
stump revision on [**2115-5-8**], with prior known
.............. from catheterization in [**2108**], who presented
with chest pain on [**2115-5-17**], from [**Hospital6 3953**] admitted for unstable angina, as well as right stump
cellulitis.

The patient was treated with Ancef and Cipro per Infectious
Disease recommendations for the cellulitis.  He was kept on
intravenous Heparin, Aspirin, Nitroglycerin drip,
beta-blocker over the weekend for unstable angina without
further chest pain or shortness of breath, awaiting prior
catheterization data which had reportedly shown
unintervenable ........... per the patient.  His primary
cardiologist is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

Laboratory showed a troponin on admission of 0.8 which
increased to 16.8 with negative CKs but positive MB fraction.
On the morning of [**2115-5-20**], the patient had sudden
shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea and vomiting.  He
was found to be hypoxic with an oxygen saturation in the 60s,
on 100% non-rebreather, systolic blood pressure 150-160,
heart rate 80-90s.  His electrocardiogram showed hyperacute
T-wave anteriorly, ST depressions in V2-V4, and chest x-ray
was consistent with failure.  The patient was given Lasix 40
IV x 1, with 500 cc urine output.  He was given 1 amp of
Calcium Gluconate and was started on intravenous
Nitroglycerin with improvement in his electrocardiogram
changes.

ABG was done which showed pH of 7.18, pCO2 73, pO2 46.  The
patient was intubated on the floor emergently.  The decision
was made to take him to Cardiac Catheterization for acute
coronary event.  Bedside echocardiogram revealed an ejection
fraction of less than 20-25%, inferior akinesis, and
anterolateral hypokinesis.  In the Catheterization Lab, his
coronaries were diffusely diseased.  The patient had been
previously turned down for a coronary artery bypass grafting,
but CT Surgery was reconsulted and again did not feel that he
would be a good operative candidate.  ..................
requested a second CT Surgery opinion which was prior to
recathaterization to attempt LAD intervention.  This was
obtained, and again several CT surgeons did not feel that he
would be a good operative candidate secondary to high risk,
lack of good touchdown, and lack of vein grafts secondary to
his previous surgeries.

Otherwise in the CCU, the patient was diuresed and extubated
on [**2115-5-21**], without complication.  His creatinine was
slightly increased with this event.  His Captopril was
temporarily discontinued, and diuresis was continued.  He was
on continued antibiotics for stump cellulitis.

LABORATORY DATA:  His initial lab data at the time of
transfer back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service on [**2115-5-23**], showed a
white count which was 19.1, hematocrit 30.0, platelet count
466,000; INR 1.1, PTT 58.0; sodium 128, potassium 4.3,
chloride 93, bicarb 23, BUN 78, creatinine 1.8, glucose 255,
CK 45, calcium 8.5, magnesium 2.2, phosphorus 4.2;
cyclosporin level was normal at 151.

Cardiac catheterization showed RA pressure of 9, RV was
40/10, RA 40/21, wedge pressure 21, SER 1390, cardiac index
of 3.0.  He had 100% proximal RCA lesion, normal PDA, left
main was normal, mid LAD had a tubular 90% lesion, distal LAD
40% lesion, D1 70%, D2 99%, OM1 70%.  Echocardiogram showed a
................. ASD with left-to-right shunt seen, left
ventricular size and thickness normal.  There were multiple
areas of akinesis and hypokinesis.  There was a hypertrophied
right ventricular free wall with normal right ventricular
function.  There was a small amount of mitral regurgitation,
small to moderate pericardial effusion, and a right pleural
effusion noted.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Cyclosporin 100 mg b.i.d.,
Neurontin 100 mg t.i.d., Lipitor 20 mg q.d., Fentanyl patch
25 q.72, sliding scale Insulin, Cefazolin IV, Cipro 500 q.d.,
Mucomyst 600 b.i.d., Colace 100 b.i.d., Lasix 80 p.o. b.i.d.,
Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d., Prednisone taper, Zantac,
Enteric Coated Aspirin q.d., NPH 4 U subcue at 6:30 a.m. and
4:30 p.m.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.  He is also with
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, peripheral vascular
disease, status post bilaterally BKAs, chronic angina,
legally blind since [**2090**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  His wife is also
blind.  He has two daughters.  [**Name (NI) **] was recently in the nursing
home.



HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular issues:  He was turned
down for coronary artery bypass grafting.  He was taken for
re-catheterization on [**2115-5-24**], and he had PTCA stent
placement to LAD.  In addition to his other cardiac
medications, Heparin was discontinued, and he was started on
Plavix x 1 month.  He was continued on Aspirin, beta-blocker,
Lipitor, Lasix, and his ACE inhibitor was restarted prior to
discharge given his normal renal function.

2.  Pulmonary:  He was able to be weaned off his oxygen with
good room air saturations and was continued on
............... 6 b.i.d. without p.r.n. doses needed.

3.  Renal insufficiency:  The patient had resolving BUN and
creatinine with a creatinine of 1.1 on discharge.  He did
well continuing on his Cyclosporin for status post renal
transplant.

4.  From a vascular and infectious disease standpoint
concerning his most pressing issue currently, he is continued
on antibiotics for stump cellulitis.  An Infectious Disease
consult was requested, as the area of cellulitis spread with
dry gangrene setting in.  They did not feel that he was
septic or toxic and that this most likely represented stump
failure.  Vascular was consulted, and they too agreed that
this was most likely not primarily an infectious process but
represented a failure of the stump revision.  This was
discussed at length with the patient who wished to pursue
further surgery at [**Hospital6 1597**] where he had been with
the same surgeon for 20 years.  We discussed this with the
covering surgeon who agreed to accept him for evaluation.
His need for surgery will have to be balanced against his
recent cardiac catheterization, as he would be at very, very
high risk for reclosure of his LAD stent if his Aspirin or
Plavix were to be discontinued at all, and Cardiology
recommended strongly that the Aspirin nor Plavix should be
held for even a day or two given his high risk and the very
narrow caliber of the LAD stent.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  ................ t.i.d., Captopril
12.5 t.i.d., Hydralazine 10 mg p.o. q.i.d., Tylenol 650 mg
p.o. q.4 hours p.r.n., Aspirin 325 p.o. q.d., Plavix 75 mg
p.o. q.d. x 30 days, Insulin NPH 14 U q.a.m. and 10 U q.p.m.,
Cyclosporin 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Neurontin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.,
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Fentanyl patch 25 mg q.72 hours,
sliding scale Insulin, Cefazolin 1 g q.12 IV, Lopressor 75 mg
p.o. b.i.d., Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d., Prednisone taper which is
now down to 10 mg p.o. q.d. which is his baseline dose status
post kidney transplant, Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Zantac 150
mg p.o. b.i.d., Cipro 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.



FOLLOW-UP:  The patient should follow-up with his primary
cardiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in one month.  He will be
evaluated at the [**Hospital **] Hospital for possible AKA.
Cardiology recommended that the surgery be done emergently as
our Vascular surgeons feel that it should be postponed for
two weeks to one month until the Plavix can be discontinued,
as it is imperative that the Aspirin and Plavix not be
stopped even for an operation, as he at high risk for stent
reclosure.
