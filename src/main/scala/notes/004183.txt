History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] is a 50 year old man with a history of COP on chronic
prednisone, OSA, diastolic CHF, DM, alcohol abuse, recent
admission for new PEs on coumadin, who presents to the ED from
rehab with mental status changes. Per report, he has been
confused x 48 hours. He has reportedly had low potassium at
rehab and has been receiving PO K repletion. Denies fevers,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Of note, records show that the
patient has been on an increased dose of Lasix since [**6-14**] (120mg
daily to 120mg [**Hospital1 **]) and was also on Metolazone for several days
earlier this week.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T96.9 P64 BP124/72 RR18 O2sat95%.
Patient was preseverating and was answering questions, however
was not able to give a full history. CXR with no new focal
consolidation or pleural effusion, but had question of resolving
PNA. Given findings on CXR and that lactate was 2.2, he was
covered for PNA and given Vanc/CTX/Azithro. WBC 13, but he is on
chronic prednisone. Na was noted to be 127, K was noted to be
2.3. Na has been 130s in the past, but never this low. Neuro
exam wnl. CT head was negative for intracranial abnormality. INR
3.0, so he did not get an LP. On prednisone, so not sure if he
masking fevers. Received 3x of 40 K in ED and rehab. VS prior to
transfer: HR 90, RR 12 SBP 100s systolic, 97% on 2L NC.
.
On the floor, the patient was noted to be altered, was not
answering appropriately, and was perseverating. He lost
peripheral access and had marked electrolyte abnormalities. He
was transferred to the ICU for concern for lack of access,
hyponatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and possible
need for hypertonic saline.
.
In the ICU, the patient was noted to have improving mental
status. He is unable to give a good history of why he is
currently admitted and is uncertain of some recent events in the
past weeks, but knows that he has come from rehab. He is
currently feeling well - no shortness of breath, chest pain,
headache, nausea, vomiting, cough, sore throat, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, dysuria. Does have pain
from rib fractures and chronic back pain.

Imaging:
CT Head [**2136-6-29**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage, territorial infarct, mass effect, or edema.
Ventricles and sulci appear normal for the patient's age. The
frontal sinuses have not pneumatized. The remaining ethmoid,
sphenoid and maxillary sinuses are well aerated. Mastoid air
cells are also well pneumatized. There is no evidence of
fracture.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CXR [**2136-6-29**]:
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of chest are obtained.
Biapical
ground-glass opacities are better evaluated on the prior CT as
were also the multiple right-sided rib fractures. Prominent
right pleural-based opacity is unchanged from the scout view
from [**2136-6-7**], and represents prominent pleural fat. Old left
anterior fifth and sixth rib fractures are again noted. No new
focal consolidation or evidence of pleural effusion is seen.
There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal
silhouettes are stable. Partially visualized hardware is noted
in the lower cervical spine.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. Additional
findings as
above.

Plain Film Knee [**2136-6-30**]:
Two views of the left knee demonstrate mild osteoarthritis of
the
patellofemoral compartment. There is mild narrowing of the
medial compartment with tiny marginal osteophytes as well.
Incidental note is made of an osseous excrescence at the lateral
aspect of the distal femoral metadiaphysis, benign findings.
