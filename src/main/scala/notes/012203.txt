Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital1 18**] ED called re trauma transfer from [**Location (un) 8641**]. Surgical team
notified. Reported 22 M involved in high impact MVC,
hypotensive, responded to volume resuscitation. Further report
stated relatively stable during transport. Trauma stat called at
11:58pm. Palpable groin pulses, HR~100, SBP 90's. Fast initially
negative. No pericardial effusion. CXR from [**Location (un) **] definitive
for left diaphragm rupture. Patient transferred to OR for
exploratory laparotomy.
In the OR (see operative report for full details), left
diaphragm laceration with herniation of stomach and small bowel.
Abdomen showed a large retroperitoneal hematoma. L diaphragm was
repaired with a running prolene suture. L chest tube placed and
L abdomen left open. Orthopaedics followed for external fixation
of pelvis, femur, and bilateral tibia/fibula fractures.
Postoperatively patient was transfered to the trauma ICU
intubated and sedated. Urology was consulted for left renal
laceration and concern for ureteral injury secondary to
hematuria.
Patient was again taken to the OR on [**2106-1-15**] for ex-lap,
sub-xiphoid pericardial window, and delayed abdominal closure
and concomitant traction pin placement, I and D of tibial and
femoral wounds, and ORIF of left SI joint.
Vascular was consulted for a concern re: questionable ischemic L
leg. Brisk cap refill, and triphasic distal AT and PT signals
were seen. There was no evidence of RLE ischmia.
Patient continued to improve in the TSICU, sedation and
ventilator was slowly was weaned. Nutrition was mainatined with
tube feeds and TPN. Patient was treated on short course of zosyn
for gram negative rods in the sputum.
On [**2106-1-28**] he was again taken to the operating room with
orthopaedic surgery for repeat I and D of his leg wound, removal
of the external fixator, and ORIF of his left ankle pilon
fracture.
He was transfered to the floor, worked with the physical
therapist and made progress. He progressed to a regular diet,
slide board transfers and remained non-weight bearing in
bilateral lower extremities.
