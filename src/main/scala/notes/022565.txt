History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 487**] [**Known lastname 12303**] is a 79-year-old left handed man with a history
of right fronto-temporal anaplastic astrocytoma, atrial
fibrillation, s/p ablation, DVT/PE on Lovenox, and asbetosis who
presented with 30 minutes of seizure.  Patient history began on
[**2155-9-28**] when he developed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure
and MRI revealed a large mass in the right frontal and temporal
lobes.  He was transferred to [**Hospital6 **] and was
hospitalized there for 3 weeks, but he developed complications
of pneumonia, urinary tract infection, deep vein thrombosis, and
pulmonary embolism.  He underwent a underwent an elective
stereotaxic brain biopsy on [**2155-12-9**]
that showed gliosis.  Patient had been on Dilantin (stopped on
[**2155-12-29**]), recently was switched to Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **].  The
patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2156-1-8**], and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed the options of a repeat biopsy. However, the
slides from [**Hospital3 **] were reviewed in pathology and
showed anaplastic astrocytoma WHO Grade III.  On the afternoon
of admission (unknown exact time) at nursing home, patient was
found to have generalized-tonic clonic seizure and was
transferred to OSH.  The seizure lasted for 30 minutes. There he
was loaded with phosphenytoin 2400 mg and found to have
pneumonia; started on vancomycin 1 gram IV and ceftriaxone and
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
On arrival, his BP was 83/44 and oxygen saturation was at 95%.
He required intubation for airway protection and BP dropped to
39/14, requiring levophed.

Past Medical History:
-anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III), right fronto-temporal
s/p stereotactic biopsy [**11-28**]
-atrial fibrillation s/p ablation
-DVT/PE during recent hospitalization at [**Hospital3 **], on Lovenox
-recent retroperitoneal hemorrhage
-asbestosis
-hepatitis C
-shingles

Social History:
He was in the Air Force.  He was smoking 1-2 packs of cigarettes
per day for 15 years; but he stopped in [**2132**].  He had 12 to 14
alcoholic drinks per week previously.  He did not use any illcit
drugs.

Family History:
His mother died of dementia.  His father died of a bee sting.
He had a sister who died of pneumonia while another has bladder
cancer.  One brother died of lymphoma while another has skin
cancer.  He has 2 sons, one has hypertension while another has
Sapo syndrome.

EGD [**2156-1-12**]:
This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to the right
PLEDs and slower and lower voltage background on the right. The
first
abnormality suggests an acute significant abnormality in the
right
hemisphere predominantly frontal and probably cortical
irritability in
this region. The other abnormality suggests subcortical
dysfunction of
the right hemisphere. The excessive background activity is
probably a
medication affect.

MRA [**2156-1-12**]:
IMPRESSION: Subacute hematoma with edema around the hematoma in
the right
temporal lobe probably related to biopsy. Diffuse T2
hyperintensity in the
right frontal and temporal lobes does not enhance after contrast

administration and is similar in appearance to prior study.
Findings may
represent a glioma.

CT Pelvis [**2156-1-15**]:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. Stranding and tiny
hematoma
surrounding the right common femoral vein.

2. Bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema
superimposed on
moderate emphysema.

3. Unusual tapering of the mid gallbladder with calcification of
the
gallbladder fundus - a right upper quadrant ultrasound is
recommended when the patient's clinical condition improves to
further evaluate the gallbladder.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 79-year-old left handed man with a history of
right fronto-temporal anaplastic astrocytoma, atrial
fibrillation s/p ablation, DVT/PE on Lovenox, and asbetosis who
presents with a 30 minute GTC on Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **].  At the OSH
he was loaded with phosphenytoin 2400 mg.  He was found to have
pneumonia, and was started on vancomycin 1 gram IV.  On arrival
to [**Hospital1 18**], BP was 83/44, SaO2 95%. He required intubation for
airway protection, and his BP dropped to 39/14, requiring
levophed.  Repeat CXR on admission showed diffuse prominent
interstitial markings but no pneumonia, so the antibiotics were
discontinued.

He was initially admitted to the NeuroICU.  MRI/MRA Brain showed
subacute hematoma with edema around the hematoma in the right
temporal lobe probably related to biopsy, and the previously
seen diffuse T2 hyperintensity in the right frontal and temporal
lobes.  EEG showed right PLEDs and slower and lower voltage
background on the right.  He was initially on Dilantin 100 mg
tid, and his Keppra was increased to 1500 [**Hospital1 **].  He was also
started on oxcarbazepine, with the goal of titrating off the
Dilantin and up on the oxcarbazepine (given that Dilantin can
interact with the chemotherapeutic agents).  He was to also
remain on the Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
He was briefly called out to floor on [**1-15**]; however, he was
found to be somnolent with SBP 83.  For this he received 500 cc
NS with improvement in his blood pressure. On examination, he
was found to have right IP and quadriceps weakness consistent
with femoral neuropathy, and there was palpated a 2 cm hematoma
in right groin. There was concern for an retroperitoneal bleed
versus hematoma around lumbar plexus, especially given recent
catheterization for atrial fibrillation ablation, as the cause
of his hypotension.  CT abdomen/pelvis showed no evidence of
retroperitoneal hematoma, but there was stranding an
