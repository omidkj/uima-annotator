History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 y.o. F with a history of hypertension, gait
instability, and memory impairment, who presented to the ED from
[**Hospital6 459**] with fever and shortness of breath. Per the
patient, her son thought she was "doing something that she
shouldn't be doing" and that was why he brought her to the
hospital. She is not sure why she is in the hospital. She denies

abdominal pain, and diarrhea. However, the transfer letter from
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab states that she was "acutely unwell, falling to one
side" and vitals per rehab were the following: T 102, HR 120, BP
150/100, RR 24, and O2 sats 89% RA. Per Rehab letter, she was
unresponsive for a few seconds but without any obvious
neurologic deficits. Additionally, she was found to be sweating,
her face was pale in color, and she became weak. She was given
Augmentin 850 mg, ASA 325 mg, and Tylenol as well as oxygen and
then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ER.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER: T 103.3 HR 110 BP 130/80 RR 32 89%
on RA ---> 96% with nebulizers. In the ED, her O2 sat was then
94-95% on 4 L NC, then 91% on 5 L NC, and then she was placed on
NRB for 95-100% O2 sats. BP was stable throughout the course in
the ED with the lowest value of 99/63. A CXR showed no acute
cardiopulmonary process. EKG did not show ischemic changes. CT
head showed no acute intracranial bleed. She was given
levofloxacin 750 mg x 1, flagyl 500 mg x 1, and vancomycin 1 gm
x 1 as well as Combivent nebs q 20 minutes x 3.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2180-3-23**] 7:05 PM
.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage,
shift of midline structures or hydrocephalus. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is grossly preserved. Age appropriate atrophy
noted. Hypodensity in the periventricular white matter of both
cerebral hemispheres is seen, consistent with severe chronic
microvascular infarction. Tiny hypodensity in the right basal
ganglia likely represents small lacune. Mucosal thickening seen
in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally, likely mucus retention
cyst in the right maxillary sinus, possible small fluid level in
the right maxillary sinus. Aerosolized secretions also seen in
the maxillary sinuses. Mucosal thickening also noted within the
ethmoid and frontal sinuses.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. MRI with
diffusion-weighted images is more sensitive in evaluation for
acute ischemia/infarction and for vascular detail.
2. Severe chronic microvascular infarction.
3. Sinus disease as described.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2180-3-27**] 9:29 AM
.
Lateral view shows a small region of consolidation in the
anterior segment of one of the upper lobes, probably the right
common, which could be a focus of pneumonia. No other pulmonary
abnormalities are present. The heart is top normal size. Lateral
view shows heavy calcification in what could be the aortic valve
as well as a small right pleural effusion. There is no pulmonary
edema, though the mediastinal veins and upper lobe pulmonary
vessels are mildly dilated. Thoracic aorta is generally large
and tortuous, but not focally dilated.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 y/o female w/ hx of hypertension, gait instability, memory
impairment, was admitted to the hospital from [**Hospital **] rehab with
Shortness of breath, fever, new oxygen requirement, +RSV titers,
healthcare associate pneumonia.
.
# presumed bacterial pneumonia on top of RSV pneumonia:
Patient received 4 days of IV antibiotics (vanc/clinda/cipro),
then transitioned over to PO levofloxacin. She responded well to
the abx, but still has new oxygen requirment. Patient is on 4L
of oxygen, sating 94%. This oxygen should be titrated down at
rehab. Pt is scheduled to finish her levofloxacin course on
[**4-7**]. Patients leukocytosis has resolved.
Patient needs no precautions.
.
#Undiagnosed COPD: Patient received IV steroids during course.
She has been on prednisone for several days. Recommend a steroid
taper 60mg x3 days, 40mg x 3 days, 20mg x 3 days. She has
responded well to ipratroprium and albuterol nebs standing q
6hours. Pt should be transitioned to as needed inhalers.
.
#Hematuria: Patient had a foley while in hospital with
hematuria. This cleared with flushing and foley was
discontinued.
.
# Depression: Patient has a history of depression and was
continued on venlafaxine 75mg daily.
.
# Agitated delirium: Patient required PRN haldol and a sitter
during her stay. She has not been agitated for the past 72
hours. Pt continues to receive daily olanzapine 10mg.
.
# Dementia [**2-26**] multiple small vessel disease. Patient is at her
baseline for memory impairment.
.
# EKG abnormalities: While in MICU patient Reported symptoms
concerning for possible cardiac origin with sweating, pale, and
weakness vs demand from early sepsis. ST depressions seen in
lateral leads compared to EKG from [**2169**]. Cardiac enzymes x 3
negative. No events on telemetry thus far.  Patient is continued
on daily aspirin.
.
#Hyperlipidemia: continued simvastin 20mg
.
#Anemia: HCT is 31, baseline 35.6. This was stable during
hospital source. Guaic negative.
.
#CODE STATUS: Is DNR/DNI
