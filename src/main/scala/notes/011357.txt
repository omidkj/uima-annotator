HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In summary, this is a patient
who presents after falling in her bathtub on the morning of
[**12-1**].  She then suffered confusion, for which she was
transferred to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]Hospital.

A head computed tomography at that time showed a right
occipital hemorrhage.  She also complained of a posterior
headache since the fall.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Her past medical history is

at the time.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives at home with her son.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Her family history was noncontributory for
any bleeding disorders or stroke.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Examination on
presentation revealed the patient was afebrile, her blood
pressure was in the 200s/100s, her pulse was regular (in the
80s), and her respiratory rate was 12 to 18.  Generally, she
was in no acute distress.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  No
bruises found on the head.  The mucous membranes were moist.
Her neck was supple.  No carotid bruits.  Her cardiovascular
examination was regular with a 2/6 systolic murmur.
Pulmonary examination revealed the lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft with bowel
sounds heard in all four quadrants.  The extremities were
warm and well perfused with 2+ distal pulses.  On mental
status examination, she was awake and alert.  She was easily
distractible and inattentive.  She reported that she was at
.................... Hospital and that it was [**Holiday **].  She
was confused and unable to give much history.  Her speech was
fluent.  She perseverated on several topics.  Her naming was
normal; however, her repetition was intact.  She had no
neglect, and she had a glabellar and palmomental sign
bilaterally.  Cranial nerve examination revealed her disks
were flat and sharp.  Her visual fields were intact to
confrontation.  Her pupils were round and reactive to light.
Her extraocular movements were intact without nystagmus.  She
had normal facial sensation with no facial droop.  Her
strength was [**5-10**].  Her hearing was intact to finger rub
bilaterally.  She had normal oropharyngeal movement.  Her
tongue was midline without fasciculations.  Her
sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscle movements were
normal bilaterally.  Her motor examination showed normal bulk
and tone without any adventitious movements.  She had no
pronator drift or slowing of rapid alternating movements.
She had motor impersistence and give-way weakness throughout,
but there was no asymmetry on her examination.  Her sensory
examination was intact to light touch.  Unable to do full
sensory examination due to her inattentiveness.  She had
extinction to double-simultaneous stimulation.  Her reflexes
on the left were 3+ in the triceps, biceps, and
brachioradialis.  On the left, reflexes were 2+ in the right
upper arm.  Her legs were 2+ bilateral patellar reflexes.
The toes were downgoing bilaterally.  She did not have any
dysmetria.  Finger-nose-finger was intact; however, she was
not able to follow commands on heel-to-shin.  We were not
able to walk her at that time.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  On presentation
her laboratories revealed an INR of 1.1.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography of the
head showed a right occipital hemorrhage without significant
midline shift.  She had old right frontal encephalomalacia
suggestive of an old lobar bleed likely due to amyloid
angiopathy.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Her hospital course was
uneventful.  She had a repeat head computed tomography which
showed no progression in her bleed.  She had issues of
hypertension during her admission, for which she was given
hydralazine as needed times three.  Her labetalol was started
and increased to 200 mg twice per day; for which her blood
pressure was stable in the 140s to 150s systolic.

She had a Speech and Swallow evaluation which she passed.
She also had Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy which
was recommended on discharge to rehabilitation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Medications at the time of
discharge were)
1.  Famotidine 20 mg by mouth twice per day.
2.  Insulin sliding-scale; however, her dipsticks were
normal.
3.  Labetalol 200 mg by mouth twice per day.
4.  Dilantin 100 mg by mouth twice per day; her last Dilantin
level was 18.5 and therapeutic on [**2184-12-4**]; her
liver function tests as a baseline prior to starting Dilantin
were also within normal limits.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION/STATUS:  She was discharged to [**Hospital 21585**]
Rehabilitation in [**Location (un) **].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Right occipital hemorrhage.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  She was instructed to follow up with her primary care
physician in one to two weeks; for which she will set up an
appointment.
2.  She also had a follow-up appointment with
Neurology/Medicine in four to six weeks after discharge; for
which she was given the appointment date at the time of
discharge.  The Neurology/Medicine appointment was here at
the [**Hospital1 69**].
