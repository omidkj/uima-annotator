History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 45 yo female w/ h/o hodgkins disease (s/p xrt 17 yrs ago
c/b development of esophageal stricture s/p multiple esophageal
dilatations), recurrent aspiration PNA's, COPD who presents with
worsening SOB. Pt was recently hospitalized in early [**Month (only) 1096**]
with similar complaints. At that time she had dilatation of her
middle esophagus however still had tight LES. After the
hospitalization the pt was able to tolerate PO but still had
trouble swallowing. @ days prior to this admission she had
several episodes of emesis and felt as if she had aspirated. She
used her inhaler with little relief. Progressively her breathing
worsened and decided to come to the hospital. She states she
completed her antibiotic course from last admission. She denies
any recent fevers, chills, chest pain, palpitations, wt loss,
myalgias, arthralgia, LE edema. She got the flu shot this year
and pneumovax last year. She has a family history of early COPD
development. In the ED she was started on ceftaz, azithro,
flagyl. Currently she states that her breathing is improved,
however still worse then her baseline. She does have a headache
but otherwise feels unchanged from admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 yo female w/ h/o hodkins disease s/p xrt c/b esophageal
stricture, multiple aspiration PNA's, COPD who presents with
SOB.

1.)Shortness of breath -- Mrs. [**Known lastname **] has recurrent pneumonias
resulting from her esophogeal stricture, which causes food to
stick while swallowing, forcing her to induce emesis, resulting
in aspiration.  This sequence of events apparently preceded this
admission.  It was felt there may have been both an aspiration
pneumonia as well as an exacerbation of her COPD.  After
admission, she was started on ceftzidime, azithromycing, and
metronidazole.  Pulmonology was consulted for a bronch/BAL to
help in determining the ultimate etiology and for micro data.
During the bronchoscopy, she developed severe bronchospasm, was
intubated, and transferred to the MICU, where she rapidly
improved with steroids and scheduled nebs.  She was easily
extubated the following day and called out the floor.
Ultimately, her BAL returned with no microbiological growth, and
her antibiotics were stopped, as she was afebrile, was
responding best to COPD tx, and was felt not to be infected.
She was started on a steroid taper and changed back over to her
home inhaler regimen.  On this course, she did well with
improved O2 saturation, baseline SOB, and no fevers or cough.
She was evaluated for home O2, but as she did not desaturate
with ambulation, she was felt not to be eligible.

2.)Esophogeal stricture -- She was last dilated on [**2157-12-13**],
although the distal portion of the esophagus was not visualized.
 She was seen by GI inhouse, who performed an EGD that showed
strictures and they performed dilation.  She was placed on a
soft mechanical diet to prevent her from inducing emesis, with
the plan for her to follow-up as an outpatient for a
re-dilation.

3.)Anti-cardiolipin Ab -- Pt has a h/o CVA. She came in on
warfarin, with an INR of 3.3  Warfarin was held and she was put
on heparin for invasive procedures.  For her outpatient EGD, the
warfarin was held on discharge, and she was sent out on Lovenox,
with a plan for her to restart warfarin with frequent INR
checks, trasitioning back to warfarin after the EGD.
