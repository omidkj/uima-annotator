.
[**2159-11-17**] OUTSIDE HOSPITAL ABD/PELVIC CT:
1. Distended gallbladder, with fat stranding, suspicious for
acute cholecystitis.
2. Proximal dilated loops of small bowel with decompressed loops
of distal bowel, concerning for small-bowel obstruction with no
definite transition point identified.
3. Cystic structure in the left pelvic area, could be from
ovarian etiology, or peritoneal inclusion cyst (surgical clips
seen in the adjacent area). Pelvic ultrasound can ne done in a
non-urgent setting to evaluate further.
.
[**2159-11-17**] (R)UQ Ultrasound:
Limited scan due to positioning of the gallbladder, and the
patient unable to cooperate; however, dilated gallbladder with
possible cholelithiasis is seen.For more detail, please refer to
CT scan report form the same day.
.
[**2159-11-17**] AP CXR:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing left
retrocardiac opacity is unchanged. Also unchanged is the
probable accompanying small left pleural effusion. Otherwise,
the radiograph is unchanged. There is no evidence of pulmonary
edema.
.
[**2159-11-19**] AP CXR:
As compared to the previous examination, the pre-existing
retrocardiac opacity, accompanied by a small pleural effusion
has minimally increased in extent. The nasogastric tube has been
removed. A newly appeared small atelectasis is seen at the right
lung bases. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No
pneumothorax.
.
[**2159-11-20**] AP CXR:
In comparison with the study of [**11-19**], there are continued low
lung volumes. Retrocardiac opacification with blunting of the
costophrenic angle persists, consistent with atelectasis and
effusion. Minimal basilar atelectasis is seen on the right
medially. Upper lung zones are clear.
.
MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2159-11-17**] Blood Culture x2: No growth to date.
[**2159-11-17**] Urine Cx: No growth - Final.
[**2159-11-17**] MRSA Screen: Negative - Final.
[**2159-11-18**] Blood Culture x2: No growth to date.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from an Outside Hospital (OSH), and
admitted to the General Surgical Service in the TICU on [**2159-11-17**]
for evaluation of the aforementioned problems.  The
abdominal/pelvic CT from the OSH was reviewed, which revealed
acute cholecytitis and findings consistent with small bowel
obstruction. She was made NPO, started on IV fluids and empiric
antibiotic therapy with Zosyn, a foley catheter, central IV
access, and A-line were placed, and she was given Morphine IV
PRN for pain with good effect.  After discussion regarding her
condition, poor prognosis and high surgical risk between the
patient, her sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], the [**Hospital 228**] Health Care Proxy
(HCP), and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient was made DNR/DNI. The sister
declined percutaneous drain placement as well. Overall, the
patient was hemodynamically stable.
.
While in the TICU, the patient was given a fluid bolus of 250mL
followed by albumin and lasix to promote diuresis for low urine
output. Metoprolol IV was given PRN for hypertension and
tachycardia. Pain remained well controlled with Morphine IV PRN.
By HD#3, IV fluid was changed to maintenance and Vancomycin IV
was added to antibiotic regimen. Started on sips for comfort.
Urine output remained good. Patient experienced elevated
temperature, but was not re-cultured. Abdominal pain was
somewhat improved on its own.
.
On HD#4, the patient was transferred to the inpatient floor.
DNR/DNI order was continued. She remained on sips, IV fluids,
and IV antibiotics. She remained comfortable with Morphine IV
PRN or acetaminophen. The patient was made comfortable. On HD#5,
the patient was feeling much better. Her diet was advanced to
clears with good tolerability. IV antibiotics were discontinued,
and she was started on a course of oral Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl
for a total of two weeks. Physical Therapy was consulted to
improve activity tolerance. Social Work was consulted to provide
psychosocial support to the patient and family. Labwork and
other invasive interventions were minimized. Ultimately, it was
determined by the family in consultation with the inpatient team
that the patient return to the Skilled Nursing Facility, whence
she came, with Hospice.
.
On HD#6, the patient's diet was advanced to regular with good
intake and tolerability. She required only acetaminophen for
pain. IV fluids, the CVL, and foley were discontinued. She was
subsequently able to void without problem. The patient's sister,
[**Name (NI) **] (HCP) was again consulted regarding the discharge plan,
and concurred.
.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating with assistance, voiding without assistance,
and pain was well controlled.  She was discharged back to the
skilled nursing facility with Hospice. The patient and family
received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with
understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.
