Chief Complaint:
non-healing chest wound

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left thoracotomy/removal pacer leads  [**2100-11-15**]


History of Present Illness:
72 yo male s/p original abdominal pacer placement in [**2053**] for
myocarditis. This failed due to infection and hemothorax.
Subsequently a pacer was placed in the left chest which was
complicated and difficult. Has had multiple surgeries including
16 generator changes. Developed a mass in the left chest which
proved to be a retained sponge from a prior surgery. This was
removed surgically in [**12-22**] along with a new generator change.
This incision developed a MRSA infection and did not heal.
Referred for surgery to remove hardware.

Myocarditis s/p pacemaker
CHF, most recent echo showing normal LV function. Last report
shows EF 40-45%
CAD, s/p prior stenting (LAD and OM)
hypertension
hyperlipidemia

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Low
normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta. Normal
aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) AR. Eccentric AR
jet.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
(2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Results were
Conclusions
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. No atrial septal defect or PFO is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta, the
aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric originating from the
base of the right and left coronary leaflets. No aortic
vegetations seen..
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. No mitral vegetations seen.
8. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. No tricuspid
vegetations seen.
9. There is no pericardial effusion.
10. A circumflex artery aneurysm is noted
11. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results during the
surgery.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 71 year old male with a history of multiple
revisions of pace-maker, coronary artery disease, chronic
systolic congestive heart failure-?acute on chronic systolic
CHF, and bipolar disorder who presents from [**State **] for
evaluation of non-healing wound and likely pacemaker revision.

 Non-healing wound, pacemaker: Patient with first pacer placed
[**2054**] cardiomyopathy secondary to myocarditis. This was an
abdominal pacemaker and his course was complicated by infection;
patient reportedly has a fistula. Since that time, he has had
multiple revisions, with one hematoma. He reports that he has
had continued drainage and bleeding from his chest wall
abnormality that is concerning for persistent infection (either
abscess, infected new or old wires that are in place) in setting
of sinus tract. He has had no fevers, chills, or other features
to suggest systemic disease. He had been on Levofloxacin for
treatment for appr
