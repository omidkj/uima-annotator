History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 year old woman who presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**11-17**]
with frontal headache and neck pain. She has a history of C4
fracture in [**2169-8-7**].

Pertinent Results:
CT Head [**11-19**]
Left sided acute on chronic SDH and Right chronic SDH

[**2169-11-21**]  EKG
Baseline artifact. Low voltage in the limb leads. Probable sinus
rhythm. Early R wave progression. Lateral precordial T wave
inversions. Since the previous tracing of [**2169-8-31**] ST-T wave
abnormalities may now be less prominent at a slower rate.

[**2169-11-21**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2169-8-30**]:

Mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality is new, and there is
hazy
opacification in the juxtahilar left mid and lower lung zones
which could be due to pneumonia. Heart size is normal. There is
no appreciable pleural
effusion.

[**2169-11-21**]  CT CHEST / ABD / PELVIS
CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST, FINDINGS: Current study is
compared to prior exam of [**2168-9-20**]. There are scattered
emphysematous changes involving both lung fields. Compared to
the prior study, there are new diffuse ground-glass opacities
involving both lung fields, predominantly on the left, however.
There is also interval development of small lymph nodes within
the AP window and in the lower paratracheal region, likely
reactive. There are no focal masses identified, no pleural
effusions seen.

Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the aortic arch, origin of
the great neck vessels and coronary artery calcification are
again seen and unchanged. There is small adenopathy involving
both axillae, also unchanged. No large pulmonary arterial
filling defects.


CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST, FINDINGS: No change in the mild
biliary
prominence with diffuse biliary air suggesting a prior
sphincterotomy. The
patient apparently has also undergone surgery for probable
reflux, though not stated within the history. The liver
demonstrates no focal masses, the portal vein is patent. The
pancreas shows no abnormalities. There is mild
prominence of both adrenal glands, likely due to hyperplasia and
unchanged
compared to the prior exam.

Both kidneys demonstrate scattered areas of cortical thinning,
indicative of a prior infectious or inflammatory insult, but
unchanged. There are also bilateral renal cysts and
hypodensities, too small to characterize but all unchanged.
There is no hydronephrosis, no definite nephrolithiasis on this
contrast only study. The visualized loops of large and small
bowel appear normal as does the spleen. There is no free fluid,
no significant adenopathy.


CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST, FINDINGS: The infrarenal
abdominal aorta
measures a maximum of 3.6 cm and is unchanged. There is diffuse
atherosclerotic disease which includes a high-grade stenosis
involving the
celiac axis. There is no evidence of bowel ischemia. There is
extensive
calcification involving the iliac vessels and marked
calcification with
high-grade stenosis involving the left common femoral artery,
all findings are unchanged, however. There is no free fluid.

There are surgical clips involving the anterior abdomen. The
patient is
status post hysterectomy. There are ill-defined areas of soft
tissue density within the right lower quadrant in the region of
the omentum or serosa. These are unchanged compared to the prior
study. Some may be iatrogenic as the overlying soft tissue
demonstrates some stranding and subcutaneous air indicative of
injections. Stability would suggest this does not represent
serosal or omental implantation resulting from any metastatic
disease.

Bone windows demonstrate significant degenerative change;
however, there is no evidence of any suspicious bony lesions.
Small grade 1 spondylolisthesis of L3 on L4.

IMPRESSION: Compared to the exam of [**2168-9-20**]:
1. Interval development of ground-glass opacities involving both
lung fields with adjacent reactive adenopathy within the
mediastinum. Given history of multiple falls, aspiration should
be considered. No definite focal pulmonary nodules or other
pulmonary parenchymal pathology.
2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease including an infrarenal
abdominal aortic aneurysm which is unchanged in size, celiac
axis stenosis, high-grade stenosis involving the left common
femoral artery.
3. Multiple other chronic changes including areas of renal
cortical thinning, renal cysts, and other small renal areas too
small to characterize but stable, prominence of both adrenal
glands, degenerative changes involving the bony structures.
4. Some ill-defined areas of increased density involving the
omentum or
serosa within the right lower quadrant, these are likely
post-inflammatory or postoperative in origin and unchanged
compared to the prior study. Overall appearance is not that of
serosal or omental implantation, especially in light of the
one-year stability.

[**2169-11-24**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. No shift of
midline
structures.
2. Post-surgical changes from left frontoparietal evacuation of
subdural
hematoma with expected pneumocephalus.
3. Acute on chornic right frontal subudural hematoma, stable
from [**2169-11-19**].
