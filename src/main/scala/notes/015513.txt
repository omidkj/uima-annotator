Brief Hospital Course:
47 yo man with HIV and hepatitis C presents with 4 days of
diarrheal illness associated with fever, chills, and poor po
intake-->hypotension.  .
.
1. Hypotension: Mentated well, was afebrile, and had little
evidence of organ hypoperfusion (Cr 2.3-->1.0 with IVF's) on
admission more consistent with hypovolemia.  That said, bandemia
of 40% and early fevers to 103.4 was concerning for systemic
bacterial illness and was treated with Cipro/Flagyl for
potential GI source. Initially required dopamine and fluids
overnight but rapidly stabilized. Cosyntropin stim test was
normal. Patient's BP remained stable following transfer from the
ICU.
.
2. Diarrhea: Acute onset associated with fever and bandemia made
infectious etiology most likely.  Ddx included E.Coli, C.
difficile (although no recent hospitalizations or abx),
Salmonella/Shigella/Yersinia/ Campylobacter (usually bloody),
Cryptosporidium/Microsporidium/ Isospora, Giardia, and viral
infections (norovirus, rotovirus). ID was consulted, continue IV
Cipro and IV Flagyl for empiric treatment in HIV positive host.
Patient had 3 negative C diff toxin tests during admission.  All
other stook studies were negative including the above mentioned
in the differential. His diarrhea gradually improved over his
hospital course.  At the time of discharge, his diarrhea had
resolved.  However, he was continued on empiric Cipro and Flagyl
upon discharge to complete a 10 day course.
.
3. ARF: Pt admitted with Cr of 2.3 which decreased back to his
baseline around 1.0 following IVFs, pointing toward a pre-renal
etiology.
.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: Non gap metabolic acidosis likely [**12-26**]
diarrhea upon admission which resolved with fluid hydration.
.
5. HIV positive.  Last known CD4 prior to admission was 776 in
[**8-29**].  Counts were rechecked during admission and was found to
be 574 on [**2167-3-6**].  Patient is not currently on HAART and no
medications were given for HIV during his hospitalization.
.
6. Depression: no suicidal ideation.  Affect was appropriate. He
was continued on home meds (abilify, effexor, klonopin, celexa,
trazodone)
.
7. Nutrition: Regular diet; replete lytes prn
.
8. Access: Received a left subclavian due to poor peripheral
access on [**2167-3-6**]  in the ICU which was removed on the day of
discharge

9. Ppx: SC heparin, PPI
