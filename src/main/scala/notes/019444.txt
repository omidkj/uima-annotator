Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] from the SICU on [**2173-5-30**] for
management of volume overload, rate controlled Afib, valvular
disease, and other medical issues.

Of note, she was recently in the OSH twice.  She was admitted to
[**Hospital3 **] on [**5-12**] for abdominal pain, which they thought
could be due to ischemic bowel in the rectum and sigmoid (based
on imaging), and it was managed medically.  At the same time,
patient was + for C. diff colitis.  She was found to be anemic
with Hct 25 and got 1 pRBC transfusion.  [**Name6 (MD) **] baseline Crt is
1.3.  Nephrology thought that this could be pre-renal or ATN.
Readmitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**2173-5-18**] for hypotension, requiring
pressors.  At that last admission, she was worked up for
possible cholecystitis.  Her Hct was 27.  WBC was 8.1.  LFT was
wnl.  She was going to be transferred for possible sepsis from
cholecystitis vs. colitis to [**Hospital1 2025**] on Reglan, Metoprolol, Zofran,
Flagyl, Zosyn (unclear reasons), [**Name (NI) 85572**], possible [**Name (NI) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **],
imdur, meclozine regularly for management of possible
cholecystitis.  However, she was consequently transfererd to
[**Hospital1 18**].
.
While in [**Hospital1 18**], they noted patient had anginal symptoms at rest
which had only been non-exertional angina.  Troponin was found
to be positive at that time with EKG changes in STD in
anterolateral leads.  She reported stable anginal and several
episodes of syncope over the last few months with increasing LE
edema.  There was no SOB or orthopnea.  It was thought that this
could be due to CHF exacerbation.  She was managed medically on
[**Hospital1 **], BB, statin, Imdur for the event and then heparin gtt for
AF.  Her C. diff was managed with flagyl and vanco and
improving.  Patient was also diuresed with furosemide after she
became hemodynamically stable.  She is still net positive 5 L.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2173-5-27**]  demonstrated: The left
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
30 %). There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the
left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular
rhythm/premature beats. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
depressed free wall contractility. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

OTHER TESTING:
- [**5-18**] CT abd: pneumonia in the right lung base, b/l trace
pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, severe atherosclerosis, no
ischemic colitis, milk of calcium vs. tiny GB stone in the GB,
status post hysteretomy
- [**5-18**] abd U/S- no GB wall thickening, possible + [**Doctor Last Name **] sign
- [**5-22**] CT abd pelvis (OSH)- b/l pleural effusion, atelectasis,
cholelithiasis, + ascites, levocurvature of the lumbar spine,
coronary atherosclerosis and calficication of the abdominal
aorta.
- [**5-20**]- C diff +
- [**5-26**] CT ABDOMEN ([**Hospital1 18**]): There are bilateral moderate pleural
effusion and bibasilar mild atelectasis. The heart and
pericardium appear normal.  The liver enhances homogeneously
without focal lesion. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is nondistended with minimal
pericholecystic fluid likely due to third spacing. There is no
evidence of acute cholecystitis. Hyperdensity layering in the
gallbladder wall likely represent small stones as seen on prior
study (ultrasound [**2173-5-26**]). The spleen, pancreas, adrenals,
stomach, loops of small and large bowel appear unremarkable.
Bilateral renal hypodensities likely represent simple cysts. The
largest on the right measures 1.4 cm (2:37). There is no
hydronephrosis or stones. There
is no free intraperitoneal air. There is a small amount of
ascites. There is no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
- [**5-26**] PELVIC CT ([**Hospital1 18**]): A Foley catheter is noted in the
bladder. The bladder, distal ureters, rectum and sigmoid appear
unremarkable. Small amount of pelvic free fluid is noted. There
is no free air or lymphadenopathy.  There is diffuse calcified
atherosclerosis throughout the abdominal aorta and both iliacs
with no significant stenosis or aneurysm formation. BONE
WINDOWS: There are multilevel degenerative changes throughout
the thoracic and lumbar spine without osseous lesions concerning
for infection or malignancy. IMPRESSION: 1. No CT findings to
explain patient's symptoms. No CT evidence of
cholecystitis or colitis. 2. Bilateral moderate pleural
effusion, small amount of ascites and anasarca.

[**2173-5-30**]: CXR IMPRESSIONS: Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural
effusions, with likely
progressing multiple bilateral consolidations. Given history of
sepsis,
locule of gas in the left retrocardiac region raises concern for
loculated
effusion or pulmonary cavitation. CT chest with IV contrast is
recommended
for further assessment.

[**2173-5-31**] CT chest:IMPRESSION:
1. No lung abscess or cavity. Conventional radiographic
abnormalities
