History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 32496**] is a 63 year old woman with history of heart failure,
diabetes, hypertension, and entero-uterine fistula, presenting
with hypotension and hypothermia at her day care unit.

Patient was brought in by her daughter after she was notified by
Day care unit that patient was found less responsive today and
vitals had revealed 76/50 at 20:50. Ms [**Known lastname 32496**] was also recently
evaluated in podiatry clinic for a left foot ulcer and started
on Bactrim. Patient is non verbal at baseline, daughter is not
reachable at this time.

In the ED, vitals: Temp 86 F oral (31.6C rectal), HR 44, BP
110/39, RR 14, O2 Sat 100%. Patient given heated humidifier and
heated blanket. Blood glucose 186.
Patient was given Vancomycin, Zosyn. Given hypotension, left
internal jugular venous line was placed and 3 L NS were given.
Urinalysis with >50 WBC, patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for futher
management.

Of note, patient has presented to our hospital two prior
occasions with hypothermia, hypoglycemia and sinus bradycardia.
On both hospitalizations patient has required agressive volume
resusitation (11L on [**10-18**]). On both admissions differential
diagnosis included myxedema coma, adrenal insufficiency and
[**Month/Year (2) 3080**], although no final diagnosis was reached.

([**2120-10-15**])
The left atrium is normal in size. There is severe symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV
(severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-7-31**],
left ventricular systolic function has improved.

Final Report
MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH MR ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK AND HEAD

HISTORY: Epilepsy. Worsening mental status from baseline.
Evaluate for new
intracranial process.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was
obtained, as
well as three-dimensional time-of-flight imaging of the circle
of [**Location (un) 431**] and
its tributaries. Finally, two- and three- dimensional
time-of-flight imaging
of the neck arterial vasculature was also acquired.

COMPARISON STUDIES ON PACS ARCHIVE: [**2121-1-9**] MR scan of the
brain.

FINDINGS: Unfortunately, nearly all images of this study are
moderately to
severely degraded by patient motion. Within these limitations,
there is
redemonstration of what has previously been characterized as a
probable
chronic infarct within the right frontal lobe. On the most
extreme cephalad
diffusion-weighted images, there is a question of a
subcentimeter curvilinear
area of restricted diffusion involving the left-sided sensory
cortex (see
series 600, images 23 and 24). It is possible that this area
could represent
a tiny area of evolving infarction. No other areas of diffusion
abnormality
are seen. There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline
structures.

The principal vascular flow patterns are identified. There is
moderate
bilateral ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening, as well as milder
sphenoid and
frontal sinus mucosal thickening, which likely represents a
chronic
inflammatory process.

The intracranial MR angiogram is of extremely poor quality due
to patient
motion. There appears to be less flow within the right middle
cerebral artery,
relative to the left, which could indicate effects of the known
right frontal
lobe infarct.

Similarly, the MR angiography of the neck arterial vasculature
is of very poor
quality. No gross area of hemodynamically significant stenosis
is seen.

CONCLUSION: Question of perhaps a tiny area of evolving
infarction within the
left sensory strip vertex region of the brain. Suboptimal study,
without
other overt interval changes appreciated.
