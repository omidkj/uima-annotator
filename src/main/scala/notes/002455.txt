Service:  CCU

ADDENDUM:  The current summary will cover hospital stay from
[**2182-9-20**] through [**2182-9-29**].

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient developed
progressive throat and esophageal pain and had an episode of
hematemesis in which he vomited approximately 500 cc of
blood.  GI was consulted.  The patient had an EGD which
showed esophagitis consistent with likely ischemic changes.
The patient was intubated for the EGD and transferred to the
ICU for closer monitoring.  He was started on a Pantoprazole
drip.  Following several days of the drip, he was transferred
over to p.o. Pantoprazole and his diet was slowly advanced.
He did not have any further episodes of hematemesis and his
throat discomfort resolved.

2.  RENAL FAILURE:  The patient was admitted with baseline
chronic renal insufficiency and symptoms of uremia over the
previous three months.  During the hospitalization, he had an
acute bump in his creatinine thought to be ATN from
catheterization dye load.  Renal consulted and the patient
was started on dialysis on [**2182-9-24**].  He underwent
several hemodialysis sessions to remove excess fluid and then
was started on a regimen of hemodialysis three times each
week.  The patient tolerated dialysis well.

3.  ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME:  The patient had a non-ST
elevation MI on [**2182-9-21**].  Given his acute GI
bleed, he was not a candidate for anticoagulation and instead
was managed medically.  He was established on a regimen of
Carvedilol, Captopril, hydralazine, and Isordil and was also
started on aspirin.  The plan is to start the patient on
Plavix when he is further out from his GI bleed.  His cardiac
medications were titrated up as tolerated throughout his
hospitalization.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was treated for C.
difficile colitis with a ten day regimen of Flagyl.  He also
developed an Enterococcus UTI and was successfully treated
with Levaquin.
