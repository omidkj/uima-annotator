Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Gold Surgery service on [**11-21**]
for treatment of abdominal pain secondary to small bowel
obstruction.

HD1: Pt given IVF, pain medication, NG tube placed, kept NPO.
Continued to have abdominal pain and did not pass gas.

HD2: had poor urine output overnight (50 cc from 12AM-6AM) which
improved with increased IVF and fluid boluses. Patients abdomen
continued to be tender to palpation and distended. The NG tube
continued to put out bilious fluid throughout the day. The
patient did not pass gas. The patient was consented for surgery
and taken to the OR for ex-lap, LOA, and intestinal bypass.

HD3/POD1: overnight the patient remained in the PACU and
continued to have low urine output despite IVF and several
boluses (the patient recieved ~5L post-operatively). Transferred
to SICU for persistent low UOP

HD 4/POD2: continues to have low urine out put. TTE done x2 for
oliguria and decreased BP (bedside exam and formal exam) which
shows worsening right sided function compared to previous echo
in [**2111**]. Urine output responds to fluid challenge. Cardiac
enzymes sent (negative)

HD5/POD3: Urine output improving, Cardiology consulted regarding
right heart failure. Cardiology recommends avoiding fluid
overload, PE workup, coagulationgulation for possible PE. Decide
to get LENI first and defer CTA at this point.

HD6/POD4: Mild somnolence overnight, ABG normal with mild CO2
retention. UOP remains 20-25cc/hr. Patient passing gas. Patient
transferred to the floor. PT ordered, Rehab screen started

HD7/POD5: Diet held pending swallow eval. Pt failed bedside
swallow, FEES study ordered. UOP continues to be 15-25cc/hr.
Respiratory status stable.

HD8/POD6: Patient continuing to pass gas. Pt had small BM
overnight. Passed bed side FEES (able to tolerated regular
diet). Diet advanced. A regular diet was well tolerated.

HD9/POD7: Stable for discharge
