Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
LLE ulcers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2117-2-16**]: Ultrasound-guided imaging for vascular access
bilaterally, femoral catheterization bilaterally with
bilateral femoral and extremity arteriography

[**2117-2-25**]:Right axillobifemoral artery bypass graft with

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9700**] is an 84M with multiple medical problems who was
transferred from [**Hospital3 7**] for eval of cellulitis/dry
gangrene of the left lower extremity. It is unclear how long the
cellulitis has been present as there was no discharge summary in
the transfer documents and Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 38758**] is a poor historian. We do
know that he has a known history of PVD with chronic skin
changes and severely diminished pulses bilaterally. During an
admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for a hip fracture repair in [**2116-12-20**],
noninvasive arterial studies revealed severe bilateral lower
extremity arterial occlusive disease, likely location is
aortoiliac.  No further workup was initiated at that time.


Past Medical History:
PMHx: Left hip fx s/p repair, PVD, CAD with ICD, acute renal
failure, carotid stenosis s/p repair, COPD, macular
degeneration,
GERD, PUD, anemia, chronic systolic heart failure with EF 20%
PSHx: B/L CEA's, appy, ulcer operation (? antrectomy), ICD

Social History:
Lives with son, widower of 2 years. Smokes [**11-20**] ppd. Non-alcohol
beer in the day and whiskey x 3 at night.


Family History:
No family history of early CAD or early sudden cardiac death.

Imaging:
CXA [**2-12**]:
1. Persistent small right pleural effusion and slight increase
in small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. Adjacent left
retrocardiac opacity
may be due to atelectasis or infection.
2. New patchy opacity at right lung base, which may be due to
either
atelectasis or infection. Rapid development since [**2116-12-20**]
is not
consistent with a neoplasm, but followup radiographs are still
suggested to ensure resolution.
ART EXT (REST ONLY) [**2117-2-15**]: Severe bilateral multilevel
arterial occlusive disease
CT abd/pelvis [**2-16**]:
1. Extensive atherosclerotic disease in the visualized arteries
and aorta.
Complete occlusion of the abdominal aorta below the takeoff of
renal arteries, without opacification of contrast of the common
or external iliac arteries. There is complete occlusion of
proximal left subclavian artery and origin of splenic artery.
Common femoral arteries reconstitutes flow from inferior
epigastric arteries. Visualized portions of axillary arteries
are patent. Superficial profunda femoral arteries are patent
bilaterally.
2. Atrophic left kidney presenting with ischemia/infarction of
lower pole.
3. Bilateral pleural effusion, left more than right, associated
with collapse of the left lower lobe.
4. Multiple lung lesions, the largest one in right lower lobe
that has
developed rapidly since [**2117-1-4**] and suggest infectious
process. A followup CT is recommended after resolution of acute
process to evaluate for malignancy.
5. Severe emphysema.
6. Calcification in myocardium of the left ventricle suggests
prior
myocardial infarction.
7. Patient is status post left hip fracture with open reduction
and internal
fixation.
8. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
9. Aneurysm of right common femoral artery.
10. Liver abnormalities ...US recommended initially.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted as a transfer to the vascular service for
further eval and managament of LE ulcers, likely caused by
severe PVD.  Physical exam revealed extensive LLE dry gangrene
ulcers secondary to severe PVD.  He also has a small dry
gangrene ulcer on the right foot as well.  The ulcers were
painful to touch and had a small amount of erythema around the
ucler edges.  Otherwise, there was no significant signs of LLE
cellulitis.  No edema.  Lower ext arterial noninvasives showed
significant monophasic waveforms at the common femoral and
popliteal arteries bilaterally. The DP and PT were absent.  PVRs
also showed dampening of the waveforms in the thigh bilaterally,
left worse than right.  Patient was consented and prepped for
angiography for [**2117-2-16**].  Patient received bicarb drip 6 hours
before and after angio for a low GFR.   He tolerated the
procedure well, and the angio showed he had occluded external
iliacs bilaterally with no access from the groins. He also
underwent a CTA which showed complete occlusion of the abdominal
aorta below the takeoff of renal arteries, without opacification
of contrast of the common or external iliac arteries.  Common
femoral arteries reconstitutes flow from inferior
epigastric arteries. Visualized portions of axillary arteries
are patent.
Superficial profunda femoral arteries are patent bilaterally.
.
At this point, it was determined that without a
revascularization procedure, the gangrenous ulcers would not
likely heal. His blood supply to his legs was from collaterals
of his hypogastrics. A cardiology consult was obtained for
pre-op purposes. He underwent an ECHO on [**2117-2-18**] which showed and
EF of 20-25%, along with severely depressed regional left
ventricular systolic function consistent with coronary artery
disease. Moderate diastolic function. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.  It was also found that an ICD lead was fractured,
and EP was consulted, who recommended fixing it down the line
once his other issues resolved. He was pre-oped and consented
for Ax fem bypass on the right and underwent surgery on [**2117-2-25**].
He tolerated the procedure, but was transferred to the CV-ICU
post-op and was put on pressors to maintain his blood pressure,
though it is known he has subclavian steal on the left so his
pressures are underestimated in that arm. The next day, he was
extubated, but over the afternoon, was found to have a large
hematoma over his anterior chest wall. He went to the OR
urgently for evacuation of right anterior chest wall hematoma.
He returned to the CVICU post-op and did well, and was extubated
the next day. By [**3-1**], he was ready for transfer to the VICU.
When he arrived in the VICU, he needed his cordis changed over,
and shortly after, he developed sustained V Tach requiring an
amio drip. He was transferred to the CCU.
.
CCU/medicine floor course
84 yo male with history of atrial fibrillation, systolic heart
failure, severe PVD POD5 of right axillary bypass, who was
transferred to the CCU for treatment of wide complex
tachycardia.
.
# WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: As the rate of the tachycardia was
regular and around 140s, the differential diagnosis included
ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with
aberrancy including atrial flutter with aberrancy. Pt has an ICD
which has a fractured lead, therefore not functioning. He was
started on amiodarone drip at 2mg/min with effective resolution
