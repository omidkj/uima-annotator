Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, VT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
79F w/CHF EF 15% and BiV ICD, COPD, DM presented to OSH from [**Hospital1 1501**]
w/dyspnea and hypotension. PT was hospitalized [**1-17**] for
dysphagia workup, at that time diuresed for CHF and had episode
of VT felt to be provoked by albuterol treatement. Exam, CXR c/w
?CHF exacerbation, no UOP to multiple doses of IV lasix. Also
tachycardic w/?VT vs SVT w/aberrancy HR in 130s. Also
hyperkalemic to 6.0 at OSH. Decompensated and developed
cardiogenic shock - hypotensive to 80s systolic requiring max
dobutamine via CVL but still hypotensive with lactate of 8. Got
lasix 40mg x2, solumedrol, xanax, nebs and was started on
dobutamine prior to transfer. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ER still
hypotensive and tachycardic.

In ED: ECG showed VT vs afib/svt with aberrancy. Given lidocaine
bolus/gtt (avoid amio given ?CHF exacerbation and beta blockade
activity of amiodarone) Pt converted to Afib with PVCs after
electric cardioversion now in BiV pacing rhythm. HR went down to
100s-110s and BP up to 90s systolic.  Pt was started on levophed
for continued hypotension, also received 200cc IVF with 100ccs
of urine out. Triple lumen IJ was placed and she was intubated
in ED with etomidate, rocuonium, for looking "downhill" after 3
attempts requiring bougie for difficult airway. Was able to
nswer questions but cold extremities. Transferred to CCU on
levophed 0.16, dobutamine 4, lido 2.75, midaz 4, fent boluses
prn. Vent settings: AC 400/18 5/60%. Vs prior to transfer -
HR:110 O2: 100% BP: 98/73 map 79.

ECHO [**2174-3-2**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15%). Marked left
ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony is present. The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve is not well seen. Significant aortic stenosis is
present (not quantified). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [In the
setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation,
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There
is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management of cardiogenic shock.  She was intubated in the ED
for airway protection.  Upon arrival to the CCU, she was
ventilating well but requiring high doses of dobutamine and
levophed for pressor support.  Echocardiogram demonstrated
worsening biventricular dilation and global hypokinesis with
wide open mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.  Cardiac enzymes
were relatively flat, suggesting no acute ischemic cause for her
cardiogenic shock.  Her lactate continued to rise, and in the
setting of cardiogenic shock requiring high dose pressor support
with an ECHO demonstrating very poor global systolic function
with extreme valvular disease, the decision was made in
conjunction with the family to make the patient comfort measures
only.

She passed on [**2174-3-3**] at approximately 3am after terminal
extubation with weaning of pressor support.
