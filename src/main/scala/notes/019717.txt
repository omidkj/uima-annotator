SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lived with her husband before
her multiple hospitalizations.  Her children are very
involved in her care.  She has no history of smoking or
alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's
temperature was 103 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was
110, her respiratory rate was 33 to 40, her blood pressure
was 120s/70s, and her oxygen saturation was 99% on 40%
tracheostomy mask.  In general, she was on the tracheostomy
mask, following commands, and answering question
appropriately.  In no respiratory distress.  Her oral mucosa
were very dry.  The neck was supple with a tracheostomy
clean, dry, and intact.  She had coarse breath sounds
throughout anteriorly.  Her abdomen was soft with positive
bowel sounds.  The percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
was clean, dry, and intact.  She had no peripheral edema.  On
neurologic examination, the patient was able to move her
extremities passively but not against resistance.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Relevant
laboratories on admission revealed the patient's white blood
cell count was 8.4.  Her lactate was 4.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed continued
left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation and a pleural
effusion.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit for
respiratory distress and concern regarding sepsis; although,
the patient maintained her blood pressure throughout her
admission.  She was called out to the regular Medicine floor
on the ACOVE Medicine Service the following day.  The
following is a brief summary of her hospital course.

 1.  LEFT LOWER LOBE PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  The patient has a
history of bronchiectasis with recurrent left lower lobe
pneumonias.  She was initially started on vancomycin and
cefepime in the Emergency Department awaiting sputum culture
results.  Her sputum culture grew methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus and sparse growth of gram-negative
rods, but no further identification.  When this result
returned the patient was continued on vancomycin, but the
cefepime was changed to Levaquin for continued coverage of
Pseudomonas if that was in fact the organism found in the
sputum culture.  None of her other cultures, including blood
cultures, grew out anything throughout her hospital stay.

 2.  BRONCHIECTASIS ISSUES:  As the patient has baseline
bronchiectasis with an increased risk of recurrent pulmonary
infections, she was continued on her outpatient regimen of
Ceftin 500 mg by mouth twice per day for seven days the first
week of every other month alternating with ciprofloxacin 500
mg by mouth twice per day the first week of every other
month.  She was to continue taking all of her inhalers and
albuterol nebulizers as needed.

 3.  CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA ISSUES:  The patient is
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 104852**] at the [**Hospital6 8865**]
concerning her cancer treatment.  Current treatment was
deferred during this admission until the resolution of her
acute medical issues.  It should be known that the patient
receives monthly intravenous immunoglobulin infusions with
the last one being on [**2142-1-10**].  Please call the
[**Hospital6 8865**] to set up further infusions.

 4.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient has type 2
diabetes mellitus and takes NPH insulin twice per day as well
as a regular insulin sliding-scale.  Her blood sugars
remained in the high 100s to low 200s throughout her hospital
stay.  On the day of discharge, her NPH regimen was increased
by one unit both in the morning and at bedtime.  Please
adjust this as needed.

 5.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had an
acute myocardial infarction during her last admission
secondary to hypotension in the setting of sepsis.  A repeat
echocardiogram was done during this hospitalization which
showed a return of her ejection fraction to greater than 55%.
She was to continue on her metoprolol, lisinopril, aspirin,
etcetera.

 6.  RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS ISSUES:  The patient was
asymptomatic throughout this admission.  She was to continue
on her outpatient regimen of 10 mg by mouth every day.

 7.  HISTORY OF CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE COLITIS ISSUES:  The
patient was diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis in
[**Month (only) 359**] of this year.  Stool samples sent during this
admission were negative for Clostridium difficile colitis;
however, she was still having loose stools.  As she has been
getting antibiotics for the past seven days for her
pneumonia, we will continue her Flagyl for the next five days
to help prevent a recurrence of Clostridium difficile
colitis.

 8.  DEPRESSION ISSUES:  We were unsure if the patient has an
official diagnosis of depression, but she s
