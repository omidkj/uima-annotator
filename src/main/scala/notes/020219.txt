Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**]
Chief Complaint:
slurred speech and altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Dr [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old man with past medical history
significant for systolic and diastolic heart failure, atrial
fibrillation, hypothyroidism, presenting from rehab facility
with volume overload and altered mental status.

On presentation, history related by pts daughter due to altered
mental status of the patient. Patient was living at home until 1
month ago when CHF acutely worsened. He had never spent a night
in the hospital before that time. At that time he lived alone
and performed all his ADLs. He had two trips to the ER in one
week for presumed CHF and was given lasix and discharged. He was
admitted to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab 3 weeks ago, and since that time has
had episodes of slurred speech, dysphonia, and angina and DOE.
Unfortunately, he was not getting his synthroid the entire 3
weeks he was at rehab. During this time, he developed worsening
DOE, angina, and speech. Denies cough, fevers, chills, syncope,
but does report several recent falls.

Patient was living at home until 1 month ago when CHF acutely
worsened. He had never spent a night in the hospital before that
time. At that time he lived alone and performed all his ADLs. He
had two trips to the ER in one week for presumed CHF and was
given lasix and discharged. He was admitted to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab 3
weeks ago, and since that time has had episodes of slurred
speech, dysphonia, and angina and DOE. Also per daugther,
patient has had synthroid inadvertently held at rehabover last 3
weeks. At rehab he was tried on various doses of lasix (10-20 mg
daily), as well as low dose coreg and an ace-i which he could
not tolerate due to hypotension. Lab tests showed an elevated
bilirubin, and RUQ u/s showed cholecystitis. HE also per report
had several falls, but reportedly no head trauma. He was given
Toprol XL 12.5 mg and Nitro patch prior to transfer. Daugther
contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] who accepted him for Cardiology
admission.

In the ED, labs were noteable for elevated Cr 1.9, BNP 11,000
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 25219**] baseline per daughter), Hct 55.1, WBC 8.1. Did not
receive any medications. CXR showed bilateral effusion with no
infiltrate. VS on transfer were 98.0 HR 91 128/93 15 98% on 3L,
93% on RA. Per ED documentation, patient was A and Ox3 in the
ED.

Patient was initially transferred to the floor, and was found to
be somnolent. ABG 7.29/62/106/31 and was transferred to ICU for
bipap initiation for presumed hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Repeat ABG in ICU with no intervention was 7.36/54/118/32.

TELEMETRY:  atrial fibrillation. Occasional PVCs, PACs. HR
70-110s.

ECG [**2127-4-18**]: atrial fibrillation 102 bpm. Incomplete LBBB.
Low voltage. Inferior Q waves. Loss of lateral R waves.  Not
significantly changed from [**2127-4-17**]. No prior for comparison.

TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2127-4-18**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is small. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to
akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls and hypokinesis of
the rest of the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are
focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild to moderate ([**2-1**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-1**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: severe biventricular systolic and diastolic
dysfunction; severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with
a small cavity

CXR [**2037-4-17**]:
Large hiatal hernia, unchanged pulmonary edema, unchanged
bilateral pleural effusions that distribute in a slightly
different fashion but are overall unchanged in extent. Unchanged
moderate cardiomegaly.

CT head [**2127-4-18**]:
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema. No fracture.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree with the above, but note
apparent post surgical changes in the right mastoid bone.

CHEST X-RAY: [**2127-4-19**]
FINDINGS: Marked cardiomegaly, tortuosity of thoracic aorta and
large hiatal hernia are again demonstrated. Bilateral pleural
effusions and bibasilar parenchymal opacities are not
substantially changed allowing for positional differences.
Interval resolution of right upper lobe Atelectatic changes.

RUE US: [**2127-4-21**]
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler evaluation of the right
internal jugular,
axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins was performed.
There is normal compressibility, flow and augmentation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

ECG: [**2127-4-23**]
Atrial fibrillation with increased ventricular response. Low
voltage. Consider inferior myocardial infarction. Late R wave
progression. Consider anterior wall myocardial infarction.
Generalized low voltage. Since the previous tracing of [**2127-4-21**]
there is no significant change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Dr [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old man with systolic and diastolic heart
failure, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation, presenting with
altered mental status and volume overload.
.
# Altered mental status: On presentation, patient noted to be
profoundly somnolent and minimally responsive. Broad
differential diagnosis in this elderly gentleman. Arterial blood
gas revealed hypercarbia, and metabolic investigation revealed
hypothyroidism. Patient [**Hospital **] transferred to MICU for potential
initiation of non invasive positive pressure ventilation,
however hypercarbia began to resolve with initiation of thyroid
hormone and with stimuli.
Infectious workup was unrevealing with exception of concern
