Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from rehab for treatment of renal artery stenosis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thoracentesis.


History of Present Illness:
76yoF with Afib, DM, HTN, PVD, CRI, and sacral/LE ulcers, s/p
CEA who was recently admitted to OSH for 1) bradycardia while on
labetalol and 2) CHF exacerbation s/p pleural paracentesis where
she was also found to have a 3) L RAS on MRI.  Of note she has
had a prior MICU admission for decompensated CHF which required
intubation, in addition to treatment of a Klebsiella UTI for
which she is on Meropenem, and hypotension, which was likely in
the setting of urosepsis.
.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for RAS intervention, but was found to
have Cr 2.2, Ca 13.7, low PTH, and the procedure was deferred.
Her course was complicated by a 4) [**Hospital1 7792**] (on [**1-19**]) which was
treated medically, and 5) pleural effusions that were tapped (on
[**1-22**]) and contained high WBC but no organisms.  The patient was
transferred to the floors where she was diuresed on high doses
of IV lasix with moderate response.  She was transferred to the
ICU due to resp distress, after several episodes of flash pulm
edema and incr. O2 requirement (ABG 7.37/51/63/31). She has
received maximal doses of IV lasix (480mg QD) with improving
UOP.  She is currently sat'ing well on 4L O2 NC.  There has been
concern from family members about possible 6) altered mental
status of Pt; they report that she is not at her usual basline.
In addition, several "staring spells" have been noted by
nursing. The Pt. is undergoing a neurologic workup.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2-27**]: 1. Pulmonary edema and left pleural effusion. 2.
Retrocardiac opacity likely from atelectasis, but pneumonia
cannot be excluded, unchanged.
.
CXR [**2-3**]: No significant interval change. Bilateral pleural
effusions, bibasilar atelectasis or consolidation, and mild
vascular congestion.
.
CXR [**2-13**]: Heavy skin-folds project over the right lower lung
zone. Pulmonary edema has improved since [**2-8**] and small
bilateral pleural effusions are smaller. Heart size is normal.
Thoracic aorta is markedly tortuous and heavily calcified and
probably dilated in the descending portion, but not acutely
changed. [**Month (only) 116**] be a mild-to-moderate degree of left lower lobe
atelectasis, not a change. No pneumothorax. Heavily calcified
right subclavian artery should not be mistaken for a
pneumothorax.
.
AXR [**2-20**]: Multiple air-fluid levels throughout the abdomen with
moderate amount distention, predominantly within the right colon
suggestive of ileus. Diffuse opacification of the right lung
field.
.
CXR [**2-20**]: 1. CHF and bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
than right. 2. Retrocardiac opacity from atelectasis and/or
infiltrate.
.
MR head [**2-14**]: Chronic periventricular microvascular ischemic or
gliotic change. No acute territorial infarct seen. T2
hyperintensity within the mastoid sinuses suggestive of possible
inflammatory disease or mastoiditis. Chronic inflammatory
changes within the paranasal sinuses as noted above.
.
EEG [**2-16**]: Abnormal EEG due to the slow and disorganized
background.
This suggests an encephalopathic condition. Medications,
metabolic
disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
The later
stages of chronic progressive neurologic illnesses can also
produce such
findings. Nevertheless, there were no areas of prominent focal
slowing,
and there were no epileptiform features.
.
Skeletal survey: No definite evidence of lytic lesion, however,
evaluation of pelvis and thoracolumbar spine is limited.
.
TTE [**2-6**]: 1.The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium
is elongated. 2.There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 3. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. 4. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 5. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. 6. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-1-14**], no
change.

Brief Hospital Course:
76yoF with CHF exacerbation, CAD s/p [**Year/Month/Day 7792**], DM, PVD, CRI, and
RAS.
.
# CHF: TTE revealed preserved RV/LV function.  Good diuresis
initially on 40mg PO BID lasix, and zaroxylyn, hydral, ISDN,
ACE-i.  CXR showed improved pleural effusions and persisting LLL
atalectasis after transfer to medical floor from ICU. Pt. has
been followed by cardiology (re: [**Year/Month/Day 7792**]), PCI probably unlikely
to improve cardiac function.  Goal 0-0.5 L negative per day, Pt.
appears to be euvolemic at the time of discharge.  Will continue
40mg PO lasix with extra doses for weight gain
