Admission Date:  [**2177-7-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2177-8-1**]

Date of Birth:   [**2107-11-9**]       Sex:  F


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old
woman who presented with a chief complaint of shortness of
breath.  She has a past medical history of breast cancer,
DCIS, diagnosed in [**2175-6-10**].  She is status post total
positive, Stage II, N0 M0 with no radiation therapy,
previously on Tamoxifen.  She also has a history of
hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes
mellitus type 2 on oral hypoglycemics, chronic renal
insufficiency secondary to diabetes mellitus with nephrotic
proteinuria.  She has a history of increased creatinine on
ACE inhibitors.  She also has a history of thalassemia trait,

ALLERGIES:   She has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She has remote tobacco use.  No alcohol
consumption.  She lives with her son.

Nine days prior to her admission to [**Hospital1 190**] she was discharged from [**Hospital1 190**] where she was admitted for a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease flare and bilateral pleural
effusions and a pericardial effusion with tamponade which was
tapped under ultrasound there, showing an exudative effusion
and cytologies were negative.  Serum [**Doctor First Name **] was positive for
1:160; a 2D echocardiogram there also showed right
ventricular wall clot/tumor, but a normal ejection fraction
of 60%.  She was treated with Levofloxacin at the time.

Upon arriving to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 346**] she was short of breath.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, she was tachypneic
with respirations of 25 to 35, saturating at 65% on room air.
She remained hypoxic on 100% face mask and arterial blood gas
showed a respiratory acidosis of 7.32/66/55.  Her left eye is
blind, abducted.  Her right eye has equal and reactive pupil.
Oropharynx is clear.  Neck was supple with no jugular venous
pressure.  Lungs were dull at the left base with decreased
breath sounds on the left, fine crackles, bibasilar.  There
was no wheezing but was rhonchorous.  Cardiovascular:  She
had regular tachycardic rhythm with a faint pericardial rub.
Abdomen was unremarkable.

LABORATORY:  Her labs on presentation were significant for a
white blood cell count of 19.4, with left shift, neutrophils
of 93%.  Her hematocrit was 40.8 with an MCV of 77.  Her
hemoglobin A1C was 7.6% and her blood gas revealed a pH of
7.32, a pO2 of 66 and a pCO2 of 55 on Bi-PAP 5/5 with an FIO2
of 35%.

Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm.  ST elevation of 1 mm in
the anterior V1 through V3 leads; no change from [**2175-6-10**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially thought to have a
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare and was treated
with nebs, Lasix and Solu-Medrol.  The patient was found to
have tamponade physiology on PTE.  She was taken for a
balloon pericardiotomy and required intubation for airway
protection at that time.  She also received an ultrasound
guided thoracentesis on [**7-4**] for a left pleural effusion
which turned out to be a transudative effusion.  She was
successfully intubated after this procedure.

Unfortunately, pulmonary and pericardial effusions
reaccumulated.  The patient had respiratory failure requiring
re-intubation on [**7-9**], at which time she was taken to
the Operating Room for a pericardial window, a left chest
tube placement and a left pleurodesis.  Post-procedure
extubation attempts were unsuccessful and the patient was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was failing
to wean from the ventilator due to many factors.  Most
notably, the patient was found to have diaphragmatic weakness
with poor negative inspiratory pressures, gastric balloon
studies were nonrevealing and diaphragm ultrasound was
suggestive of a diaphragmatic weakness.  She was also found
to have critical care polyneuropathy and myopathy as well
which probably contributed significantly to her failure from
weaning.  She also has a component of bronchoconstriction on
top of a restrictive lung disease which responds to Albuterol
nebulizers.  Due to the failure to wean, the patient was
trached on [**2177-7-17**].

From a cardiovascular standpoint, the patient was diuresed
for congestive heart failure, titrated on afterload reducing
medications for systolic hypertension including Metoprolol
and Lisinopril.  Her initial serial PTE's showed
reaccumulation of pericardial fluid which was loculated but
did not show any signs of tamponade.

The patient required treatment for a Candiduria and was given
Diflucan for five days and then Foley catheter was changed.
She was also treated with Levofloxacin for five days for a
urinary tract infection between [**7-19**] and [**7-24**].  The
patient had increasing white blood counts starting [**7-21**]
with no determined source until [**7-27**] when her urine cultures
grew out Vancomycin resistant enterococcus.  She was
previously given a course of Vancomycin for Gram positive
cocci in one out of four bottles of blood culture, but was
discontinued when the urine cultures revealed Vancomycin
resistant enterococcus.  She was started on Linezolid.

Her hospital course was also complicated by a contrast
induced nephropathy which is resolving.  As mentioned
previously, the patient had an EMG which showed evidence of
critical care neuromyopathy.  Since starting the Linezolid,
the patient has had decrease in fever spikes and falling
white blood cell counts.  She has responded accordingly from
a Pulmonary standpoint where she is able to tolerate a
T-piece.

The patient had a PEG tube placed on [**2177-7-28**].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   The patient's cause of recurrent
pericardial and pleural effusions are still unknown to date.
Her pleural effusions are transudative in nature.
Rheumatology has evaluated her and determined that this is
not a rheumatologic cause since her [**Doctor First Name **] was negative at the
time of admission.  Repeated pleural and pericardial effusion
cytologies never showed any evidence of malignant cells nor
did the pericardial biopsy from the pericardial window
procedure.

The patient's current Pulmonary status is improving,
progressing from a ventilatory support of 25/7.5 at an FIO2
of 0.4 and tidal volumes of 200 to 400 cc, has
diminished to tolerating T-piece during the day.  She
continues to require Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers to
help with her reactive airway disease.  Her pulmonary
effusions are also decreasing and her pericardial effusions
appear to be stable.  No repeat of the pericardial effusion
echocardiogram is required unless clinically indicated.

Other cardiovascular issues include her blood pressure which
has stabilized as well on Metoprolol and Lisinopril.  Her
renal function contrast induced nephropathy is also resolving
and her creatinine is returning to baseline.

From an Infectious Disease standpoint, the patient has a
Vancomycin resistant enterococcus in her urine being treated
with Linezolid requiring a seven day course.  She is
currently on day number four at time of discharge on
[**2177-7-30**].

From an Endocrine perspective, the patient is on insulin
sliding scale and 8 units of NPH a day, split 4 units in the
morning and 4 units before dinner.  From a hemodynamic
standpoint, the patient has required several units of blood,
but the hematocrit is stable at 28 on [**7-29**] and is currently
on Epogen 3 times a week to maintain her reticulocyte count.
The patient may require other units of packed red blood cells
to keep her hematocrit above 27.

She was also found to have an SPEP with 2% gamma band.  This
result is not significant for myeloma; most likely consistent
with MGUS.  Her urinary PEP is still pending.

From a gastrointestinal standpoint, she currently has a PEG
tube in place requiring tube feeds of ProMod with fiber.  She
is still a full code and communications are with her son.
The patient is ready for discharge to a Vent Core Unit to
wean her off of her tracheostomy.
