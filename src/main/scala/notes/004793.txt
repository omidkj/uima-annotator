Pertinent Results:
CT from [**Hospital1 1474**]: Evidence of SAH, with significant blood around

WBC: 27.7; Hct: 44.4; Plt [**Telephone/Fax (3) 74654**]9 207
2.8 17. 1.0

CTA [**8-28**]:
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage on the head CT with mild dilatation
of the temporal horns indicating early obstructive
hydrocephalus.
2. CT angiography demonstrates an aneurysm at the origin of the
left posterior inferior cerebellar artery. No evidence of
vascular occlusion, stenosis or other aneurysms identified.

ECHO: EF 25-30%

CT Perfusion [**9-3**]:
1. Narrowing of the left distal vertebral artery and basilar
artery suggest moderate vasospasm when compared to vessel
diameter [**2111-8-28**].
2. Abrupt occlusion of the left PCA consistent with evolving PCA
territory infarct.
3. Status post coiling of left PICA aneurysm.

CT Perfusion [**9-6**]:
Relatively unchanged appearance of large evolving left PCA
infarction with smaller left PICA infarction compared to
[**2111-9-3**]. Associated edema and herniation into the left
temporoparietal craniotomy defect is unchanged.
No perfusion abnormalities of the right PCA or visualized
portions of the bilateral MCA distributions.

[**2111-9-30**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Repositioning of the ventricular
catheter as described above.
Overall unchanged appearance of the brain with large area of
infarct with
hemorrhage and herniation through a large cranial defect.
Post-PICA coiling.

[**2111-9-29**] Chest xray : FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of
[**9-5**], there has been essentially complete clearing of the
bilateral pulmonary opacifications. Tracheostomy tube is in
place, as is a gastrostomy tube.

[**2111-9-28**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Comparative study demonstrating
again the large cerebral herniation through the frontoparietal
craniectomy which is unchanged since the prior examination.
Blood products are again noted in the infarcted area. GDC Coils
are identified in the vascular territory of the left posterior
inferior cerebellar artery as described above.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 74655**] is a 41-year-old woman who presented with an
aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Her hospital course by
problem was as follows:

1. SAH. Because she was medically unstable on admission, coiling
could not be performed immediately. She was admitted to the
MICU, where her blood pressure was supported and stabilized on
two pressors. The following morning, she underwent coiling of
the L PICA aneurysm. She also had and EVD placed. She was not
given nimodipine given her hypotension. She was given dilantin.
Sequential CT perfusion studies revealed no significant
vasospasm. On [**9-4**] angio revealed mild vasospasm and verapamil
was given. On [**9-5**] albumin was started as well as triple H
therapy. On [**9-8**] the EVD was raised to 15. Her TCDs showed mild
vasospasm Left MCA and moderate vasospasm Right MCA. The EVD was
clamped on [**9-9**] and removed the following day. Neurologically
she continued to improve and by [**9-13**] the patient was following
some commands, tracking the examiner, and able to interract with
her family. The patient was transferred to the stepdown unit on
[**9-17**].

2. L PCA cerebral infarct. This was discovered incidentally on
her CT perfusion study. Her blood pressure was maintained
initially with a goal of SBP > 160, and later 140-160.

3. Seizure. She had apparent seizure activity. Neurology was
consulted and recommended continuing Dilantin.

4. MI. Echo revealed EF 25-30% after MI. She was given
supportive care.
   On [**9-17**] she had non-sustained v-tach for 13 beats. She
returned to sinus tach
   with no intervention. Cardiology was consulted and
recommend*******
   On [**9-18**] the patient had sinus tach into the 140s and cards
recommended*******

5. Pneumonia. Apparently due to aspiration. She was treated with
levo/flagyl.

6. Nutrition/resp: The patient had a trach and peg placed on
[**9-11**]. She was switched to a trach mask shortly after the trach
was placed and was able to be transferred out of the ICU to the
stepdown unit.

7. ID: On [**9-17**] all pending CSF cultures, urine, and sputum
cultures were negative.
   She was afebrile at that time.

8. Speech/swallow: The patient was fitted for a passimuir valve
and was able to speak with it in place. She had a video swallow
evaluation on [**9-18**] which showed***********

9. Hydrocephalus - Pt had developed hydrocephalus late in the
hospital stay ([**9-28**]) - she was brought to the OR for VPS
placement for treatment for this. Sutures to be removed on day
14 post-op, steri strips will fall off on their own.

10. On discharge neuro exam is stable, with Left upper and lower
extremities -spontaneous movement, right upper extremity weak
withdrawal to painful stimuli, and right lower extremity
withrdraws to painful stimuli. L pupil is reactive to light,
from 2.5mm to 1.5 mm, R pupil is enlarged at 4mm, decreases to 2
mm, then rebounds back to 4 mm, this is a stable finding. She
follows simple commands, oriented to self. Left craniectomy site
is slightly edematous, with surgical scar well healed. Right
frontal incision clean dry intact, sutures to be removed on
[**2111-10-13**]. Abdominal incisions are well appr
