Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness, fever
.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line
s/p fiberoptic intubation


History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old man with a history of multiple CVAs with
right side weakness who presented to the ED on [**2181-6-8**]
complaining of weakness x 3 days.  He also complained of
abdominal pain which he has had in the past with a negative
workup.  He denied N/V/D.
.
In the ED, abdominal CT scan revealed some diverticulosis but
otherwise no explanation for his abdominal pain.  He had a fever
to 101.1 in the ED and was admitted to Medicine for workup of
his weakness/fever/abdominal pain.
In the ED, he was started on empirical levo and flagyl and blood
cultures were drawn.  a U/A, and CT abdomen/pelvis were
negative.  CXR showed mild fluid overload and enlarged heart,
and CT of his head was neg for new pathology.  He had a neuro
consult that demonstrated no neurological changes from baseline.
 The patient had a ground level fall in the ED, and a repeat CT
scan of the head showed no bleeding.

Physical Exam:
VS:T:99.0   BP:130/82   HR:80   RR:16  O2sat:95%RA

periumbilical.  No rebound, no guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly.

Pertinent Results:
CT head:No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Chronic changes.  Stable appearance compared to [**2181-5-14**].
CT A/P:Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.  No
explanation seen for the patient's acute abdominal pain
KUB: Normal bowel gas pattern without evidence of obstruction.
CXR:Mild CHF/volume overload.  No evidence of pneumonia
CT chest:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated bibasilar
atelectasis. The effusions are new since the prior chest CT in
[**2179**].
3.  Coronary arterial calcification.  The study was not
performed using gated technique.
ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left  ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and hyperdynamic systolic  function (EF>75%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion  abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated  (>15)
suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg).  There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral
valve leaflets with a moderate  resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction (peak 54mmhg). Right  ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve  leaflets are
moderately thickened. Severe aortic stenosis is not suggested,
but mild aortic stenosis cannot be excluded/possible. No aortic
regurgitation  is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral  regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There is
a a very small anterior pericardial effusion with a prominent
epicardial fat pad. No hemodynamic compromise is suggested.
CT neck: Suboptimal study due to the artifacts from the teeth.
No evidence of parotid abscess/stones. Evidence of inflammation
in the soft tissues of the neck.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Angioedema/ airway compromise: While on the floor, the pt's
throat and cheeks and neck began to swell.  Two days later, on
[**2181-6-10**], his blood pressure dropped to 50/palp.  He was given 3L
NS and his BP rebounded to the 80's.  However, his O2 sats
dropped to 90% on 4L and he was transferred to the ICU for
further management of his hypotension/ hypoxia/ angioedema. A CT
of the neck was negative for abscess, however soft tissue
inflammation was seen. Pt's O2 requirement was felt to likely
related to airway compromise from severe facial/neck swelling.
He underwent fiber optic intubation for airway protection. He
was initially on AC which was weaned to PSV 5/5 and he was
successfully extubated on [**2181-6-14**] and comfortable on room air
prior to discharge to floor. In terms of his fever/facial
swelling, the differential included mumps, adeno, paraflu,
parotid duct obstruction, bacterial parotitis, or facial
cellulitis. Angioedema also possible given hx of lisinopril
(most likely cause), aspirin, and ibuprofen use, combined with
eosinophilia.  His neck CT findings were not consistent with
enlarged parotid glands or severe facial cellulits; hence
angioedema seemed most likely. His lisinopril and ASA were
stopped because of their penchant (especially lisinopril) for
causing angioedema. ENT was also consulted and did not find any
obvious sources for his neck swelling. Steroids were held
because of concern for infectious etiology (though 1 dose was
given; ENT had felt that holding the steroids for use until
prior to extubation would be a better strategy).
Viral throat cx negative, strep throat cx negative. After his
initial neck CT, he had a repeat neck CT on [**6-12**] which showed new
stranding in the subcutaneous soft tissues of the posterior neck
and occiput consistent with edema. THere was also stranding of
soft tissues of the chest, slight stranding near the parotid
glands is stable, irregularity of opacification of the left
internal jugular vein (probably due to filling artefact as this
appears to occur near the entry point of an anterior venous
structure), and iterval opacification of the paranasal sinuses
with increasing mucosal thickening. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 100410**] of these
findings, as diagnosis still remained uncertain. The filling
defect was not a thrombus as confirmed by US.
He was initially on steroids, but stopped per ENT as it was felt
that the effects of the steroids would be most useful to
decrease airway edema prior to extubation.
Allergy was consulted who felt that patient should not be
continued on lisinopril, but K to restart ASA and dipyridamole.
Per dental consult, tooth pathology likely not cause of pt's
neck swelling. With Diphenhydramine alone, the patient's edema
had started to resolve and his oxygenation and ventilation were
appropriate four days after intubate; hence he was extubated
without difficulty. On discharge C1 esterase inhibitor, Mumps
antibody and C2 was still pending.
.
# Hypotension: no clear etiology of the pt's hypotension during
the initial episode of neck swelling was found. The pt was
thought to be hypovolemic and he was thought to have increased
intrathoracic pressures due to airway obstruction from the
swelling. These two factors were thought to decrease the pt's
diastolic filling on which he was largly dependent given his
outflow obstruction in the context of HCOM. The pt was treated
with Nafcillin, Levo and Flagyl for five days, but antibtiotics
were subsequently discontinued as the pt was afebrile and
