History of Present Illness:
This is a 40 year-old man with AIDS diagnosed in [**2171**] last CD4
count of 27 and viral load of [**Numeric Identifier **] re-started on HAART salvage
this month who activated EMS today for shortness of breath.  He
is admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after being intubated for airway protection
due to altered mental status and on pressors for hypotension.
History is obtained from family and partner, [**Name (NI) **] notes and [**Name (NI) **]
notes/doctors.

As per his family and partner, he was feeling well until this
afternoon.  He was at work and apparently felt he had an
"anxiety attack". He felt short of breath and palpitations and
was brought to the ED by EMS.
Family also notes that last friday he started a new HIV
medication and subsequently developed chills, diarrhea, fever to
103 and some new red "bumps" appeared on his legs. The following
day felt better.

As per Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 42346**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] notes confirm initiation of abacivir,
truvada and kaletra.  A [**2-17**] telephone contact notes initiation
of all meds at that time without significant complication.  The
patient's family thinks he may have been staggering initiation
of meds.  As per ED physician and [**Name9 (PRE) 9168**] notes, patient reported
that he started a new medication today before his shortness of
breath started.

History obtained in ED from patient documents that patient
became short of breath after using crystal meth today.

Of note, recent hospitalization in [**2191-12-11**] with fevers,
MRSA finger infection, pancytopenia, transaminitis.  Treated for
MRSA infection and had seeming resolution of other issues.  At
that time had AFB sent--was positive but no TB as per state
lab--thought was it could be MAC but state lab results still
outstanding.

In the ED, T 99.2 at 12 noon-->102.4 at 4:30PM Hr 128 BP 138/76
at 12 noon-->72sbp by about 4:30PM RR 25 Sats 98%. He received 5
liters of fluid, significant amount of ativan, was noted to have
altered mental status with bizarre behavior, intubated for
airway protection, given cefipime and vancomycin, started on
pressors.

Pertinent Results:
[**2192-3-1**] CT Head - No evidence of hemorrhage or mass defect.
Sinus findings as described above.  Apparent fullness of the
nasopharynx. Correlation with clinical exam is recommended.
[**2192-3-1**] CXR - No acute cardiopulmonary process
[**2192-3-5**] RUQ U/S - Two small hemangiomas in the liver, otherwise
normal right upper quadrant ultrasound.

lobes and peripheral ground- glass opacities in the upper lobes
with bronchocentric nodules in the right lower lobe and
enlarging noncalcified pulmonary nodule in the right middle
lobe. Bilateral small pleural effusions.  The findings are
consistent with an infectious process but are not specific for a
particular organism. Differential diagnosis includes fungal
infection such as cryptococcus or bacterial or mycobacterial
infection.
[**2192-3-6**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] - Unremarkable examination of the brain. Diffuse
paranasal sinus disease as indicated on the CT examination.
Bilateral changes of mild mastoiditis of uncertain chronicity.


Brief Hospital Course:
  Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 92744**] is a 40 year-old man with history of AIDS
recently started on salvage HAART as an outpatient who initially
presented with shortness of breath in the setting of crystal
methamphetamine use.  He was noted to have bizarre behavior in
the ER and was intubated for airway protection. He was not
hypoxic and had a clear CXR.  Notably, in the ER he was also
found to have neutropenia and was given one dose of cefepime.
The patient has a cephalosporin allergy (reaction being
hypotension) and in this setting he became hypotensive, briefly
requiring pressors.  He was also noted to be febrile, however
this was in the setting of having already received the cefepime.
 He was intubated only briefly, and did well post-extubation in
the ICU.
  Reportedly his fevers did not start until after receiving the
cefepime in the ED suggesting a medication reaction. However he
was febrile up to 104 overnight [**2111-3-3**]. He is certainly
susceptible to multiple infections given his HIV status and at
least transient neutropenia. All cultures, with the exception of
a positive serum cryptococcal antigen, were negative.  With
CD4=29 the differential was broad.  He was followed by
infectious disease during his stay.  Head MRI was unremarkable
and chest CT was unrevealing.  cultures remained negative.  The
patient was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics,
including antibacterials, acyclovir and fluconazole.  Acyclovir
was discontinued after HSV PR from CSF was negative.  AFB x 3
was sent from induced sputum. The patient has a positive AFB
culture at the state lab for 2 months that returned
MYCOBACTERIUM FORTUITUM.

The patient was discharged on levo/flagyl to complete a 10 day
course (today is day #5) and was continued on fluconazole
indefinately until seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  At the time of discharge
all HIV meds were being held.  He will be restarted on a new
regimen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  There was a question as to whether some
of his symptoms were abacavir hypersensitivity.


Medications on Admission:
abicavir, kaletra, bactrim, truvada, azithromycin--although
unclear which of these he was taking recently

Discharge Medications:
1. Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 16
