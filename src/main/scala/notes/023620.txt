Lungs CTAB
Heart RRR 2/6 systolic murmur
Abdomen Benign
Extrem Trace LE edema
Superficial and anterior varicosities
Carotids with transmitted murmur and bruit

Pertinent Results:
[**2120-12-26**] CXR: 1) Gradual resolution of the left retrocardiac air
space disease. 2) Gradual resolution of the interstitial most
likely pulmonary edema. 3) Heart size slightly decreased in size
on today's examination. [**2120-12-23**] Echo: PRE CPB The left atrium is
mildly dilated. No spontaneous  [**Doctor Last Name **] contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is
dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the
right atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal dyskinesis and
severe apical and distal anterior wall hypokinesis There is
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis as well
(LVEF = 25 %). There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free
wall of the right ventricle. [Intrinsic right ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Due to co-existing
aortic regurgitation, the pressure half-time estimate of mitral
valve area may be an OVERestimation of true mitral valve area.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. POST
CPB: The patient is receiving milrinone and norepinephrine by
infusion. There is mild right ventricular global hypokinesis
with improved apical function. The left ventricle continues to
show septal dyskinesis and distal anterior apical severe
hypokinesis. The function of the other walls is improved. Left
ventricular ejection fraction is about 30%. Initially after
separation from bypass, a jet of moderate aortic regurgitation
emanating from the bileaflet prosthesis in the region of the
native valve right and left commisure was seen. It appeared to
be a valvular jet. The patient was returned to bypass and a
suture that prevented leaflet closure was removed. After
separation on the second attept the bileaflet prosthesis
appeared mechanically stable with normal leaflet function. There
was still mild to moderate valvular aortic regurgitation though.
Although the regurgitation appeared valvular, suboptimal image
quality prevented complete exclusion of a perivalvualr source.
The jet seen after first attempt was still present but much
improved. Both leaflets appeared to be opening normally. The
peak gradient across the valve was 27 mm Hg with a mean of 18 mm
Hg. The effective valve area was about 1.1 cm2. An annuloplasty
ring was seen in the mitral position. It was well seated. There
was trace mitral regurgitation. The maximum gradient across the
valve was 13.4 mm Hg. A tricuspid annuloplasty ring is also
seen. It is well seated. There is mild tricuspid regurgitation
with a maximum gradient of 7 mm Hg across the valve.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room on day of admission,
[**2120-12-23**], where she underwent a CABG x 1, AVR, MV repair and TV
Repair. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in critical but stable condition. Later on op day she
was extubated and weaned off inotropes. On post-op day one her
chest tubes were removed and she was transferred to the
telemetry floor. Diuretics and beta blockers were started and
she was gently diuresed towards her pre-o weight. She was
started on Coumadin for her mechanical aortic valve and this was
titrated until her INR was therapeutic. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. She worked
with physical therapy during her post-op course for strength and
mobility. She appeared to be doing well and was discharged on
post-op day four. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will follow her INR and adjust her
Coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5-3 (INR on [**12-27**] is 2.8).
