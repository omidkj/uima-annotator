Chief Complaint:
Incessant ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None this hospitalization


History of Present Illness:
This is a 80 year-old Male with a PMH significant for coronary
artery disease (s/p CABG in [**2083**], [**2088**]), infarct-related
cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%), status-post biventricular ICD
placement (EPS revealed VT inducible with triple extra-stimuli
from the RVA), atrial flutter status-post ablation, multiple
atrial tachycardias status-post ablation, and AVNRT status-post
slow pathway modification who was recently admitted with
incessant VT and underwent ablation ([**2114-10-24**]) who presented
with chest pain.
.
The patient was feeling well until the evening of [**2114-11-14**], at
8PM, when he developed chest pressure. Shortly following this,
his ICD fired 4-times. EMS was called and an additional
10-shocks were witness by the EMS staff (overall 23-shocks
recorded from his device). He received 324 mg PO Aspirin and IV
Amiodarone 150 mg followed by a continuous infusion prior to
arrival at [**Hospital1 2025**]. In the [**Hospital1 2025**] ED, initial VS 97.1 160/79 71 18 95%
3L NC. His exam was notable for 1+ pitting edema. He was noted
to have recurrent, slow wide-complex tachycardia (at 150 bpm)
and was started on a Lidocaine gtt at 2 mg/min, which resulted
in reversion to a paced rhythm. His initial EKG showed VT @ 140,
upright in V1, II, III, aVF, negative in I, aVL; almost positive
concordance in the precordial leads. His Troponin was 0.07 and
0.26, CK-MB 4.3 to 8.8. Creatinine 1.8, magnesium 2.1 and
potassium 3.0 (repleted to 3.9). A CXR showed a patchy left
retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis. He had no symptoms of
chest pressure, shortness of breath, diaphoresis or nausea; no
palpitations. He remained hemodynamically stable and was
mentating at baseline following his last shock. He was
transferred to BIMDC for further management.
.
Of note, the patient was admitted to the CCU on [**2114-10-24**] with
chest pain associated with nausea and dyspnea and his ICD fired
around that time. In our ED, he developed incessant VT with
associated chest pain and his blood pressure was tenuous in the
SBP 90-100 mmHg range. Anti-tachycardia pacing was attempted and
would only break the VT for 2-3 beats with return to a
wide-complex rhythm. Electrophysiology was consulted and he was
taken to the EP lab from the ED where he underwent ablation of
an inducible focus of ventricular tachycardia which was the
presumed source. His VT-1 was a left-bundle type morphology with
a superior axis and negative throughout the precordial leads,
very similar to the EKG morphology during RV-pacing. Biosense
mapping revealed scar at the inferior wall and apex. The
earliest site of activation was located at the atrial septum. A
second site (VT-2) revealed a right-bundle branch morphology
with a right inferior axis, earliest activation site in the
basal inferolateral ventricle. A third site (VT-3) was a right
bundle-branch block with qR morphology in the inferior leads;
this was poorly tolerated and required pressor support with
Dopamine. A VT-4 site was noted as well, right bundle-branch
block morphology with an inferior right axis and positive
throughout the precordium. 40-seconds of ablation was applied to
the VT-1 site. Following this procedure, he was monitored in the
CCU following ablation and had no recurrent episodes of VT on
telemetry. He had stopped Amiodarone prior to discharge (on
[**2114-10-27**]).
.
Of note, he had a positive urinalysis and urine culture with
coagulase positive Staphylococcus last admission which was
treated with IV Ceftriaxone as an inpatient and 5-days of
Cefpodoxime.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient is mentating at baseline. He
is without chest discomfort, has no nausea, palpitations or
diaphoresis. He denies shortness of breath. He notes some
on-going urinary dribbling and stopping-starting, no dysuria.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.
.
ROS: The patient denies a history of prior stroke/TIA, deep
venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. Denies headaches or
vision changes. No upper respiratory symptoms; mild, chronic
non-productive cough. Denies chest pain, dizziness or
lightheadedness; no palpitations. Denies shortness of breath. No
nausea or vomiting, denies abdominal pain. No dysuria or
hematuria. No change in bowel movements or bloody stools. Denies
muscle weakness, myalgias or neurologic complaints. No
exertional buttock or calf pain.
