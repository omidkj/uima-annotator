Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Pneumovax 23

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Mental Status Changes/Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar Puncture

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 year old male with hepatitis C, history of alcohol
abuse, bipolar affective disorder, atrial fibrillation, and a
recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for pneumonia who was transferred from
an outside hospital where he had presented with mental status
changes and dyspnea.   The patient was not able to give a full
account of the circumstances leading to his admission, but per
his family he had increasing dyspnea and confusion starting
approximately five days prior to presentation.  He may have had
chills but no fevers and he was noted to be extremely fatigued.
At the outside hospital he was febrile, bradycardic,
hypotensive, non-verbal, pale, and not following commands
reliably.  After initial lab results did not reveal a clear
source of his illness he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were T 100, BP 89/40, HR 45, RR
16, 94% on 2L. Over his ED course he became progressively more
hypoxic and eventually required 4.5L of O2 by nasal cannula to
maintain a sat of 92%.  He was initially bradycardic with rates
in the 40's but this spontaneously improved to 70s-90s without
interventions.  His SBP's improved to 90's-100's with 2L IVF.
His chest radiograph revealed a right middle lobe infiltrate,
which he had recently been treated for at [**Hospital1 18**] (admission until
[**2186-5-10**]).  He received vancomycin and levofloxacin for a
possible pulmonary infection as well as IV metronidazole as the
patient had diarrhea and had C diff in [**Month (only) 958**].  He was
transferred to the ICU for further management.


Past Medical History:
- Atrial Fibrillation
- History of clostridium difficile
- Bipolar Affective Disorder
- History of hepatitis C
- History of rheumatic heart disease
- History of right middle cerebral artery aneurysm clipped in
[**2167**] at [**Hospital6 1708**]
- History of pernicious anemia
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Social History:
He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has a history of alcohol abuse but
this was greater than twenty years ago.  He stopped smoking
after his previous hospitalization (about one month prior to
presentation) but previously had a 40 pack year history.  He had
been discharged from his last hospitalization with oxygen but
had not been using this prior to admission.

Family History:
His father had lung cancer and his mother had congestive heart
failure.

OTHER STUDIES
===============
ECG on Presentation: sinus at 72 with frequent PACs, nl axis, nl
intervals, no ischemic changes; prior was afib with rvr, but
otherwise unchanged

Portable Chest Radiograph [**2186-6-14**]:
IMPRESSION: Persistent unexplained dense consolidation and
volume loss
of the right middle lobe.

CT Head [**2186-6-14**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage

Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2186-6-14**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
-Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-5-3**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly
higher.

Liver/Gallbladder Ultrasound [**2186-6-14**]:
IMPRESSION: No focal liver lesions. No ascites.

Abdomen Radiograph [**2186-6-14**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction or ileus.

CT Chest W/O Contrast [**2186-6-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent severe consolidation in the right middle lobe,
showing improved aeration, but no bronchial obstruction,
probably inadequately treated pneumonia.
2. Bilateral pleural effusion, small on the right, very small on
the left,
improved since [**5-4**], and lymphatic engorgement in the upper
lungs,
probably indication of cardiac dysfunction as well as volume
overload.
Probable calcific aortic stenosis.
3. Stigmata of cirrhosis, not fully evaluated on this study.

CT Head W/O Contrast [**2186-6-16**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute abnormality seen.

EEG [**2186-6-17**]:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG recording due to the
slow
and disorganized pattern, the left anterior temporal lower
amplitude
recording and the right temporal intermittent focal slowing. The
first
abnormality suggests widespread mild encephalopathy of a
metabolic,
ischemic, or medication etiology. The second abnormality
suggests a
cerebral or extra-cerebral abnormality interfering with the
voltage of
the recording such as a hematoma or severe cortical abnormality.
The
last abnormality suggests a subcortical dysfunction in the right
temporal area. Of note was the atrial fibrillation. If capturing
discrete episodes of unconsciousness or unresponsiveness is the
main
objective of this study, a more prolonged EEG telemetry should
be
considered.

Chest Radiograph [**2186-6-18**]:
FINDINGS: Lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are
flattened, consistent with COPD. Compared with [**2186-6-14**], there is
a new small right pleural effusion extending into the minor
fissure. Again seen is patchy opacity at the right base,
consistent with collapse and/or consolidation. No CHF. The right
mid and upper zones of the left lung remain grossly clear. No
gross left-sided effusion. Asymmetric pleural thickening is
noted at the right lung apex.
