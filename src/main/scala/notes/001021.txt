History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 47367**] is a 58-year-old man with a history of AML s/p
allogeneic transplant [**2142**] complicated by graft-versus-host
disease, multiple vertebral fractures and ultimately development
of paraplegia in the setting of a vertebral fracture during a
code situation. Admitted multiple times, most recently [**8-/2148**]
for bacteremia and upper resp infection (cx: staph epi) and
completed a course of vancomcyin, aztreonam. Discharged from
rehab and home (wheelchair bound) with recent clinic followup
[**9-26**] noting baseline health.

Wife also states he was in his usual state of health until the
morning of admission when she went to wake him he was more
somnolent than usual and seemed to be having difficulty
breathing taking rapid shallow breaths.  His wife attributed his
somnolence to recently starting Ambion and Valium 3 days prior
to admission in addition to his home narcotic regimen of
oxycontin and dilaudid. She also noted that he looked more pale
than usual. She reports that he had a cough starting over the
weekend productive of yellow sputum. No history of fevers, and
outside of baseline pain, he had no complaints. Given his
somnolence, EMS was called and administereed narcan in the field
without improvement so he was admitted to Study hospital on
[**9-30**] for acute respiratory failure. On arrival he was afebrile,
tachycardic to 160s (sinus), hypotensive to 91/58 (though fell
to 60s-70s per wife), RR of 8, and was satting 94% on BIPAP.  He
was bolused 500cc with improvement of HR to 130s. He was bolused
more NS (unclear how much) and remained hypotensive so was
started on norepinephrine 2mcg/min and given stress dose
hydrocortisone. He does have a triple lumen port, but given poor
peripheral access, an intraosseous was placed.  He was given an
additional dose of narcan given continued somnolence and
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] at the family's request given that all
of his care has been here.

In the ED, initial VS were T 98.6 HR 128 BP 89/69 RR 17 99% on
BIPAP and initial ABG was 7.27/61/83. Labs were notable for
leukocytosis to 14.2, Trop-T: 0.18, Lactate:3.4, creatinine of
1.1 (baseline 0.6-0.8), and a grossly positive urinalysis with >
182 whites and moderate bacteria. He has an indwelling foley
catheter that was changed this past Thursday. A chest x-ray was
notable for LLL consolidation. He had received emperic
vancomycin at the OSH and received a dose of Zosyn in the ED
here.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T: 99.5 HR: 115 BP
121/69 RR 20, O2 sat 93% 100% NRB and was receiving levo at
1mcg/min on arrival. He was somnolent but arousable and oriented
x 3, but slow to answer questions. Complained of pain from the
chest up, but otherwise no complaints.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI. His wife notes that he did a few episodes of loose
stools. Morning headaches recently.
(-) Denies fever, chills, chest pain, chest pressure,
palpitations. Denies dark or bloody stools.
