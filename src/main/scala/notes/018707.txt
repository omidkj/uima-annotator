Chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2145-6-23**] Endovascular Stent Repair of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm
[**2145-6-25**] Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 72-year-old gentleman who presented to [**Hospital3 12748**] with chest and back pain. He ruled out for MI.
Dobutamine stress testing was negative for ischemia. SPECT
showed LVEF of 64%. Chest CT scan was suggestive of probable
contained rupture of mid-thoracic aorta saccular aneurysm. He
was urgently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
surgical intervention. Of note, patient was recently treated
with Bactrim DS for a recent pneumonia.

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT [**6-22**]: Penetrating ulcer of the descending thoracic
aorta at the level of inferior pulmonary vein, surrounded by
somewhat hyperdense soft tissue mass measuring 4.3 x 2.9 cm and
50 [**Doctor Last Name **] on noncontrast scan, worrisome for mediastinal hematoma in
the setting of underlying penetrating ulcer. Urgent clinical
attention is needed. (Other possibility of the metiastinal soft
tissue mass includes metastatic disease in this patient with
history of renal cell carcinoma, or esophageal in origin.
However, the soft tissue is most closely related to the aorta,
and is asymmetrically located on the side of penetrating
ulcer.). Coronary artery calcifications. Asbestos-related
pleural disease. Bilateral pleural effusion with right lower
lobe consolidation, representing pneumonia versus atelectasis.
Clinical correlation is recommended. Extensive emphysema. 3.2 cm
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with mural thrombus.
Atherosclerotic disease of thoracoabdominal aorta. Status post
left nephrectomy. Right renal cyst. Calcified sludge in the
gallbladder. Somewhat prominent loops of small bowel in the
lower pelvis measuring up to 2.2 cm filled with fluid. Clinical
correlation is recommended. Dilated fluid-filled upper
esophagus, with thickend lower esophagus. Please evaluate for
the possibility of esophageal disease.
Echo [**6-23**]: Pre stent: Overall left ventricular systolic function
is normal (LVEF>55%). There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. Approximately 6 cm below the left subclavian, an
outpouching is seen consistent with a contained rupture of the
thoracic aorta. The outpouching is at least 2.5 cm in diameter;
there is no flow in this area. A wire is seen in the lumen of
the thoracic aorta during the procedure. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Evidence of a
Thoracic endostent is seen in the descending thoracic aorta in
the area previously described as a probable contained rupture.
The graft appears well seated. There is no evidence for
endoleak.
Chest CT [**6-30**]: Patient is status post endoluminal stent graft
placement for penetrating aortic ulcer without evidence of
endoleak, and decreased size of surrounding hematoma. Large
subcutaneous anterior abdominal wall hematoma at site of
surgical incision and partially involving the left rectus
abdominis muscle. Post- surgical focal dilatation of left common
iliac bifurcation consistent with Dacron graft insertion and
hematoma. Stable 3.2-cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm with
calcifications and mural thrombus. Stable bilateral pleural
effusions. Bilateral centrilobular emphysema with scarring at
the right lung base in this patient status post right
thoracotomy. Retained mucous retention cyst in the distal
trachea and right main stem bronchus, with fluid layering in a
superiorly dilated esophagus. Clinical correlation is
recommended. Status post left nephrectomy. Right renal artery
stenosis with evidence of infarction. Multiple right renal cysts
requiring ultrasound or MRI for further evaluation.
Asbestos-related pleural disease. Gallstones. Right adrenal
adenoma.
CXR [**7-1**]: Compared with [**2145-6-29**], the infiltrates in the right mid
and lower lung fields appear slightly more confluent. There
appears to be increased volume loss on the right, as evidenced
by slightly more shift of the heart and mediastinum, although
this has not changed dramatically. The left lung appears grossly
clear with interval re-expansion of the left lower lobe
atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 67535**] was admitted and underwent CTA which demonstrated a
penetrating ulcer of his descending thoracic aorta at the level
of inferior pulmonary vein, surrounded by somewhat hyperdense
soft tissue mass measuring 4.3 x 2.9 cm and 50 [**Doctor Last Name **] on noncontrast
scan, worrisome for mediastinal hematoma. The CTA was also
notable for coronary artery calcifications, asbestos-related
pleural disease, bilateral pleural effusions with right lower
lobe consolidation, extensive emphysema, and a 3.2 cm infrarenal
abdominal aortic aneurysm with mural thrombus. Based on these
results, the patient was referred through Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] for stent
graft repair. The patient was felt to be a good candidate for
stent graft repair because the penetrating ulcer was fairly
localized to the junction between the proximal and middle third
of the descending thoracic aorta with good landing zones for a
stent graft proximally and distally. The patient and the
patient's family understood the risks and benefits of the
procedure, and wished to proceed. On [**6-23**], Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] performed an endovascular stent repair of his
thoracic aortic aneurysm. For surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation, he
was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. Due to
some mild respiratory distress and thick secretions with
hypoxia, thera
