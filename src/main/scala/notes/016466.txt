Service:  VASCULAR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nonhealing ulcer of the right malleolus.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66 year old
white female with a history times six months of a right
medial malleolar nonhealing wound.  She has had three courses
of antibiotics over the last six months, i.e., Cephalexin 500
mg, Ciprofloxacin plus Ampicillin.  Last course was Bactrim
DS 800/160.  The Sulfa course was not tolerated well and it
was associated with loose stools and nausea.  She cannot
recall any specific injury to the site and denies venous
stasis disease.  Pain is with walking but accentuated with
climbing stairs described as a heaviness in the hip.  No
direct hip pain.  She denies rest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Sulfa causes nausea and vomiting.
2.  No previous medical problems.
3.  [**Name2 (NI) **] previous surgeries.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  She is not on any medications.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  This is a 66 year old white female, married
for fifty years.  She lives with her husband.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Remarkable for ten pound weight loss over
the last two months, fevers, chills, sweats and adenopathy.
She admits to a murmur which is known for years but no
myocardial infarction, hypertension, chest pain, congestive
heart failure, ankle edema.  She denies liver disease, bloody
stools, melena, early satiety, abdominal fullness.  She
denies renolithiasis, hematuria.  She denies syncope,
seizures, amaurosis, aches, weakness, paresthesias.
Menopause in late 40s, menarche at age 12.  She denies any
vaginal symptoms, vaginal bleeding or discharge.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed blood pressure
82/60, pulse rate 110.  General appearance - She is an alert
white female, cachectic in appearance.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat examination shows tongue is midline but
fissured.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation, nonicteric.  The neck is supple.  There is
no jugular venous distention or thyromegaly, no
lymphadenopathy appreciated.  No breast masses.  Pulse
examination - Carotids are palpable without bruits.  The
right brachial and radial are palpable 1+.  The left brachial
and radial are absent by palpation.  The right femoral is
dopplerable.  The left is palpable 1+.  The right popliteal,
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial are absent. On the left,
the popliteal is 1+ with dopplerable dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial signals.  Chest examination - The lungs are
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart is regular rate
and rhythm, but sounds are very distant.  There are no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdominal examination is scaphoid
and soft, nontender, nondistended, no bruits, masses.  No
abdominal aortic aneurysm widening noted.  The veins are very
prominent on the right lower quadrant, superficial abdominal
skin veins.  The rectal examination was deferred secondary to
just completing an arteriogram.  The bone/joint examination
shows feet ruborous, cold bilaterally, equal.  The right
medial malleolar ulcer is clean base with no erythema or
exudate.  Neurological examination is unremarkable.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
30.2, hematocrit 37.5, platelet count 539,000, differential
neutrophils 84, bands 6, lymphocytes 8, monocytes 1, no
eosinophils or basophils.  Blood urea nitrogen was 11 and
creatinine 0.5, potassium 3.4 which was repleted.  Serial CKs
were obtained which were 136, 121, and 120.  CK MB were 8, 6.
6 and 5.  Troponin remained less than 0.3.  TSH was obtained
which was 0.69 which is normal.

Preoperative chest x-ray was remarkable for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease with increased density in the
right lung apex.  The patient had a P-MIBI done on [**2158-11-20**],
which showed abnormal myocardial perfusion with severe fixed
defect in the inferior wall toward the base with a mild
amount of reversibility in the distal anterior wall extending
into the apex and inferior apex.  Global ejection fraction is
diminished to 46% with hypokinesis of the inferior wall.

Preoperative electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia with
ventricular premature depolarizations.  Anteroseptal
myocardial infarction.  Diffuse nondiagnostic repolarization
abnormalities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
preoperative holding area on [**2158-11-14**].  She underwent a right
iliofemoral to femoral popliteal bypass with greater
saphenous conduit.  She tolerated the procedure.  She was
transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable
condition.  Immediately postoperatively, she was
hemodynamically stable.  Her postoperative hematocrit was
37.5.  Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 11 and 0.5,
respectively, potassium 4.3 and repleted.  Initial CK was
136.

Postoperative day one, there were no overnight events.  The
patient did have episodes of sinus tachycardia.  Electrolytes
were repleted.  Cardiology was requested to see the patient
because of persistent tachycardia and atrial flutter versus
MAT versus sinus tachycardia.  Their recommendation was this
was most likely MAT and that they would recommend check the
postoperative chest x-ray for rule out for any infectious
process that might be causing the tachycardia, begin
Verapamil 40 mg three times a day and titrate to maintain the
heart rate less than 60 and a systolic blood pressure greater
than 100.  Postoperative pain control with good pulmonary
toiletry and Atrovent multidose inhaler as needed.
Recommended echocardiogram prior to discharge.  Check TSH to
rule out thyroid disease.

On postoperative day two, she continued to remain the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit for continued hemodynamic
monitoring and diuresis with heart rates between 80 and 120.
Electrolytes were repleted.  Verapamil dosing adjusted to
maintain her heart rate less than 100.

On postoperative day three, she remained afebrile.  Her white
blood cell count was 20.0, she was defervescing.  Clinically,
she was improved.  Her pulse examination remained unchanged.
She was delined and transferred to the regular nursing floor.
The patient continued to show improvement but did develop
Clostridium difficile which required treatment with Flagyl.
The patient was evaluated by physical therapy and they felt
that she would progress to be safe to be discharged to home.

She underwent a P-MIBI on postoperative day six which was
positive for inferior wall myocardial infarction with some
reversibility.  She was discharged on [**2158-11-21**], in stable
condition to home.  She should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in two weeks time.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day, hold for systolic blood
pressure less than 100 and heart rate less than 55.
2.  Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. three times a day.
3.  Verapamil 40 mg q8hours.
4.  Wound care right medial malleolar ulcer with Hydrogel to
wound base once daily with dry sterile dressing change.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in one weeks time for skin staple removal.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Ischemic medial malleolar ulceration, status post right
ileofemoral to femoral popliteal bypass with greater
saphenous conduit,
2.  New unsolved MAT, treated.
3.  Positive Persantine MIBI.
