Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 58 M with CAD, CHF, DM, ESRD on HD, cocaine abuse p/w chest
pain and shortness of breath 1 day following cocaine abuse.


##. Chest pain. Pt was originally admitted to the ICU for
hypervolemia and chest pain with a recent history of cocaine
use. Work up of the chest pain showed negative troponins,
unremarkable EKG. CTA Chest also showed negative for PE and
aortic dissection. Chest pain thought to be musculoskeletal as
pain was reproducible and relieved by Tylenol.

##. Shortness of breath. During admission pt was noted be
hypervolemic, he has a history of non-adherence to dialysis
regimen. A Chest xray in the ICU showed bilateral pleural
effusions that were subsequently tapped and shown to be
transudative. Pt's shortness of breath appeared to improved
following thoracentesis, pt was discharged home with complaints
of shortness of breath.

##. C-Diff colitis: After transfer to the wards from the ICU pt
was noted to have some right upper quadrant pain with diarrhea.
An abdominal U/S was performed and showed no evidence of biliary
disease. C. Diff assay was shown to be positive on the day of
discharge. Pt was given a prescription of Flagyl and a follow up
appointment was made for [**2155-8-18**].


##. ESRD on HD: Pt received hemodialysis whilst in house on his
schedule Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. Pt was also given a
prescription for Cinacalcet 30mg.


##. A-fib with RVR: Pt was rate controlled on PO Metoprolol for
his A-fib whilst in house. On a review of his outpatient notes
it appears as if a discussion was initiated regarding starting
Warfarin on Mr. [**Known lastname 107485**]. It appears that at that time Mr.
[**Known lastname 107494**] history of non-adherence would leave him to a higher
risk:benefit ratio if he were started on Warfarin.

##. systolic/diastolic CHF (EF 20-25%). Upon admission to the
ICU pt was noted to be hypervolemic. Pt was continued on
Lisinopril and monitored for fluid balance. He was able to
return to euvolemic status following repeated hemodialysis. From
his clinincal status it is likely that his fluid status is due
to his adherence to dialysis versus a primary cardiac issue.


##. DM type II: Mr. [**Known lastname 107485**] was continued on his home insulin
(NPH 20 [**Hospital1 **]) with sliding scale.
