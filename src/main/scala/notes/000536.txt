Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypokalemia, weakness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
74 year old female with metastatic breast cancer on chemo (CMF,
last tx [**2113-4-7**]) x3 wks with mucositis since presents with
increasing fatigue/weakness and hypokalemia to 2.1. Of note, the
patient was treated for ATN due to port-a-cath infection with
sepsis and she has been on lasix at home since discharge in [**Month (only) **]
[**2112**].  She reports poor po's due to mucositis and thrush over
the past several weeks.  Routine blood work revealed the
hypokalemia and she was referred into the ED this afternoon for
further treatment.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.8, HR 96, BP 96/60, RR 16,
O2sat 100%.  Electrolyte abnormalities included K 2.1 and Mg 2.0
for which she received 40 mEq IV KCl and 2 gm IV magnesium
sulfate as well as an additional 3L IV NSS.  EKG was without QTc
or U waves. SBP's were 85-low 90's. Of note, one lumen of her
power PICC was clotted so TPN was instilled prior to transfer.
Vitals on transfer were T 98.0 HR 90 BP 90/60 RR 16 Sats 100% on
RA.
.
The patient reports persistent fatigue.  She denies fever or
chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.

CXR: 1. Unchanged course of the left PICC catheter with tip
projecting over distal SVC. 2. Persistent small pleural
effusions with associated atelectasis. 3. Diffuse osseous
metastasis and old rib fractures.

TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 70%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. Compared
with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-1-13**], probably no major change but the technically
suboptimal nature of the present study precludes definitive
comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Name (NI) 13337**] is a 74 year old female with metastatic breast
cancer on chemo (CMF, last tx [**2113-4-7**]) x3 wks with mucositis
presents with increasing fatigue/weakness and hypokalemia to 2.1
in the setting of dehydration and diuretic use.

* [**Name (NI) **] Pt hypotensive to 80s-low 90s in ED, down from
baseline of 90s to low 100s.  Thought most likely [**1-31**]
dehydration, although given her positive PICC line culture,
there may have been a component of sepsis.  Pt does have a
history of a small pericardial effusion and low voltage on EKG
in the ED, although no other overt signs of tamponade.  TTE was
obtained and showed a small pericardial effusion and no signs of
tamponade.  IVF resuscitation was continued overnight with an
additional 2L overnight in addition to the 3L the patient
received in the ED, with improvement in her blood pressures to
100's to 110's systolic, which remained stable during her
hospitalization.

* Bacteremia - On the day of admission, had blood culture drawn
that returned positive for enterococcus and GNR, which were
later identified as Enterobacteria.  Additionally, the tip of
the catheter was "tortuous" as seen in her CXRs.  Given these
two factors, her PICC line was pulled and was given a 48 hour
line holiday.  The PICC was replaced on [**2113-4-28**].  She was
started empirically on vanco/cefepime.  Once sensitivities
returned, she was transitioned to ampicillin and cefepime.
While Enterobacteria was sensitive to Cipro, Cefepime will be
continued since it is cheaper, is once a day, and patient is
paying out of pocket for IV antibiotics.  TTE was negative for
vegetations.  She refused a CT scan in the hospital for further
work up her bacteremia.

* [**Name (NI) 13338**] The pt received 40 mEq IV KCl in the ED then an
additional 40 mEq IV KCl immediately on arrival to the MICU.
She then received 2L of D5NS with 40 mEq KCl/L and an additional
20 mEq IV KCl, with improvement in her potassium to. She was
given 50mEq KCL to take daily, and Lasix moved to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] (8am
& 1pm).  Outpatient Labs to be checked Mon [**2113-5-1**] and sent to
Dr.[**Name (NI) 13339**] office.  It was thought that admission hypokalemia
was due to non-compliance with potassium supplements.

* Hypomagnesemia- Received 2g Magnesium repletion in the ED with
resolution.

* Chronic renal insuffiency (stage 3) - Lasix was initially
held, but restarted on [**2113-4-28**], and adjusted to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] on
discharge.  She will go home with potassium supplements.  She
will need chem panels checked at home on Monday by VNA after
discharge to ensure stability.

* Port a cath wound infection - She suffered from this wound
infection in [**12/2112**], but the wound remains open.  Wound care was
consulted and they had made recommendations to obtaining a
surgical consultation.  Surgery was called and felt no need for
debridement, but recommeded plastics consult and breast consult
in future given wound and h/o breast cancer. This can be done as
an outpatient.  She will need continued VNA care of her wound
after discharge.
