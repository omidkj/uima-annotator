Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2203-8-3**]
Right thoracotomy and tracheoplasty with mesh,
right mainstem bronchus and bronchus intermedius
bronchoplasty with mesh, left mainstem bronchus bronchoplasty
with mesh, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 62-year-old
gentleman who has severe COPD was found have severe diffuse
tracheobronchomalacia.  He had marked improvement in dyspnea
with a silicone Y-stent, and presents for
tracheobronchoplasty.  He is using inhalers as prescribed
with some sx improvement and using oxygen at night. Without O2
he
is satting about 88-90%.

He had a mild URI several months ago and fully recovered from
it.
He is able to walk several blocks w/o stopping; he is OK going
up
one flight of stairs but usually needs a break at the end.

He presents now for surgery.

[**2203-8-14**] Chest CT :
1. Status post tracheobronchoplasty. ET tube in place with fluid
within the distal trachea. Persistent narrowing of the central
airways.
2. Since [**2203-8-1**], new large right, and moderate left
loculated pleural effusions.
3. New diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities with prominent
pulmonary
vasculature, likely edema.
4. Bilateral lower lobe opacities, likely atelectasis, cannot
exclude
infection.
5. Emphysema.
6. Prior granulomatous disease.

[**2203-8-18**] Bilat lower ext duplex :
 No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

[**2203-8-23**] Chest CT :
1.  Extensive bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities with
associated
bibasilar severe atelectasis and small pleural effusions along
with the severe tracheobronchial stenosis suggest that a
combination of upper airway obstruction, pulmonary edema,
atelectasis, and likely a concurrent infectious process might be
contributing to the patient's difficulty to wean off the vent.
2.  Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, not significantly changed
compared with prior studies.

[**2203-8-29**] CXR :
In comparison with the study of [**8-27**], the monitoring and support

devices remain in place.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette with indistinct pulmonary vessels and bilateral areas
of pulmonary opacification, consistent with pulmonary edema and
multifocal pneumonia.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
