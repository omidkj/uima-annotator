History of Present Illness:
HPI:This is a 54 year old female with history of migranes who at
3 am experienced headache and speech difficulties. The headache
had been gradual onset and had originally started at 3 pm in the
afternoon. At approx 3am, the patient's husband called 911 and
the patient was brought to [**Hospital3 **] where a Head CT
revealed extensive SAH and left sided hemorhage.  The patient
was
given Dilantin 1000mg and Decadron 10 mg IV.  The patient was
intubated and trasnferred here for further care. The husband
states that she took one Aspirin 325 mg po last night. He states
that the patient does not take any other blood thinning
medications such as coumadin, heparin, plavix or lovenox.  She
does not take Aspirin on a daily bassis.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2161-8-24**]
IMPRESSION:
1. ETT in proximal trachea, please advance 3 cm.
2. NGT in distal esophagus, please advance 10 cm.

CTA BRAIN [**2161-8-24**]
CONCLUSION: Extensive left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage,
as well as
subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. Demonstration of
left
supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm. Intervention
neuroradiology
consultation advised, if not already obtained.

CT BRAIN [**2161-8-24**]
There is interval development of a small amount of
hyperdense material overlying the longus [**Last Name (un) **] muscles in the
nasopharynx.  The finding could represent a small amount of
blood, secondary to the intubated status of the patient.

CT Head [**2161-8-25**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Increase in the size of the large left frontal lobe
hemorrhage.
2. Worsening mass effect and shift of normally midline
structures.
3. Evolving left MCA and PCA infarcts.

CT head [**2161-8-25**] post-op
1. Patient is status post left hemicraniectomy with mild relief
of the mass effect. Shift of the midline structures is still
significant at 1 cm to the right.
2. Unchanged extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and large left
frontal lobe
hematoma.

ECHO [**2161-8-26**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is dilated. There is moderate to severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the
distal two-thirds of the left ventricle. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. A mass is present on the aortic
valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional LV systolic dysfunction suggestive of
stress cardiomyopathy. No significant valvular abnormality seen.
Mild to moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.

CXR [**2161-8-26**]
ET tube, left subclavian line and nasogastric tube are in
standard placements respectively. No consolidation. Heart size
normal. No pleural effusion.  Lungs essentially clear.

CXR [**2161-8-26**]
Comparison is made with prior study performed on same day
earlier in the
morning. There are low lung volumes. Cardiac size is top normal.
Mediastinal widening is unchanged. Lines and tubes remain in
place and unchanged in standard position. There is no
pneumothorax. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There
is new mild-to-moderate vascular congestion.

BLE Dopplers [**2161-8-27**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

ECHO [**2161-8-28**]
Moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Differential diagnosis includes stress
cardiomyopathy or neurogenic regional LV systolic dysfunction

CXR [**8-28**]
Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position. Cardiac size
is top
normal. There has been interval improvement in now mild
pulmonary edema.
Left lower lobe retrocardiac atelectasis has improved.
Persistent opacities in the right upper lobe could be due to the
pulmonary edema, but attention in this area is recommended in
followup studies to exclude a focus of infection

CTA head [**8-28**]
1. Limited study due to venous contamination. However, there
appears to be
narrowing of the mid to distal basilar artery and narrowing of
the bilateral M1 MCA segments suggesting vasospasm.
2. Increased midline shift and mass effect from the large
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.
3. Stable intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, intraventricular
hemorrhage.

CT HEAD: [**2161-8-29**]
FINDINGS: There is overall little change in the extensive
intraparenchymal, bilateral subarachnoid and intraventricular
hemorrhage. Right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter
terminates in the third ventricle.  Ventricular size is
unchanged. There has also been no change in approximately 15 mm
rightward shift of normally midline structures. The patient is
status post left frontal craniectomy. Marked sulcal effacement
bilaterally, greater on the left is again seen. Metallic
artifact from coil was seen in the region of the supraclinoid
ICA.

There is partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells, as
on the
previous study with the remainder of the paranasal sinuses well
aerated.

IMPRESSION: Grossly stable widespread subarachnoid,
intraparenchymal and
intraventricular hemorrhage with unchanged 15 mm rightward
subfalcine
herniation. Hypodensity in left cerebral hemisphere extending to
occipital
cortex is also unchanged.

[**2161-8-30**] CT PERFUSION
IMPRESSION:
1. Head CT shows no significant change since the CT of
[**2161-8-29**] with
left-sided craniectomy and blood products in the left frontal
lobe with
surrounding edema and hypodensity in the left occipital lobe.
2. CT perfusion shows perfusion abnormality in the region of
hemorrhage, but no other perfusion abnormalities are seen.
Diffuse perfusion abnorm
