HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old female
with a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, and glucose
intolerance who presented to the Emergency Department with a
cough.

The patient was in her usual state of health until three days
prior to admission when she began experiencing a "cold."  She
improved two days prior to admission.  On the day prior to
admission developed coughing, sweating, mild shortness of
breath, and some weakness.  She denied chest pain,
palpitations, and leg swelling.  She denied any travel.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be
febrile to 101, hypoxic with an arterial blood gas of
7.49/33/71 on nonrebreather.  She was started on
levofloxacin, intravenous fluids, and ceftriaxone and was
transferred to the Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypothyroidism.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Glucose intolerance.
4.  Grave's disease; status post ablation.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Home medications included)
1.  Levoxyl 100 mcg p.o. q.d.
2.  Diltiazem-CD 300 mg p.o. once per day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works with children and lives at
home with her husband.  She denies tobacco, ethanol, and
drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission,
temperature was 101.7, blood pressure was 146/71, heart rate
was 116, and oxygen saturation was 97% on 100% nonrebreather.
In general, the patient was a pleasant female in no acute
distress.  Sclerae were anicteric.  The oropharynx was clear.
No jugular venous distention.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed tachycardia with normal first heart sounds and
second heart sounds.   Pulmonary examination revealed
decreased breath sounds at the left base.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.
No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremity examination revealed no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  No calf tenderness.
Neurologic examination revealed awake and oriented times
three and mentating well.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  On admission,
white blood cell count was 8.2, hematocrit was 36, and
platelets were 332.  Differential with 67 bands, 5
lymphocytes, and 4 monocytes.  Electrolytes revealed sodium
was 134, potassium was 3.5, chloride was 92, bicarbonate was
24, blood urea nitrogen was 17, creatinine was 0.9, and blood
glucose was 112.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed a left
lower lobar pneumonia and effusion with layering.

Electrocardiogram revealed tachycardia at 115 with left
atrial enlargement.  There were ST depressions laterally;
consistent with risk of ischemia versus hypertensive
repolarization.  These were new compared to [**2188-2-18**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Unit.  She
was continued on antibiotics.  Respiratory culture returned
showing beta streptococcus group A (heavy growth).  Blood
cultures from the day of admission also returned with group A
streptococcus.

She was continued on penicillin while in the Unit.  Her
oxygen requirement improved; however, her white blood cell
count three days after admission continued to trend up.  She
was transferred to the floor.  At this point, she was started
on clindamycin and Infectious Disease was consulted.

Her white blood cell count trended down to 10.1 on the day of
discharge.  After beginning clindamycin, she became afebrile
and maintained this as well until the time of discharge.

Two days prior to discharge, the patient complained of
increased pain in her right knee.  The knee was tapped.  This
showed a white count of 167, red blood cells of 64,000, 42
polys, 37 lymphocytes, and 17 monocytes.  It was felt this
was likely due to a bursitis.  The Gram stain showed PML and
no microorganisms.  Blood culture preliminarily showed no
growth two days after obtaining fluid.  The knee felt better
after the tap and remained without effusions until the time
of discharge.  This was to be followed up on an outpatient
basis.

Electrocardiogram changes resolved during her hospital
course.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Left lower lobar pneumonia.
2.  Bacteremia with group A streptococcus.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:   The patient was to follow
up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3029**] on [**2195-3-31**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Diltiazem 300 mg p.o. once per day
2.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. twice per day.
3.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once per day.
4.  Albuterol/ipratropium 1 to 2 puffs inhaled q.6h.
5.  Levothyroxine 100 mcg p.o. once per day.
