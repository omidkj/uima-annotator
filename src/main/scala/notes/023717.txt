Chief Complaint:
63 yo male with h/o 8cm AAA resection
with aortobifemoral graft in [**12-11**], who was diagnosed in [**5-12**]
with type B dissection from distal aorta to L subclavian to
aortobifem graft. Pt admitted [**2120-12-31**] elective thoracoabdominal

aortic aneurysm repair with reimplant SMA/celiac/L renal/R renal

fem-fem bypass on [**12-31**]. Bronchoscopy on [**1-2**] notable for mod
thin secretions and several blood clots. Pt was reintubated due
to mucus plugs, requiring several bronchs while intubated. Pt
also developed acute renal failure, volume overload. Pt was
extubated on [**2121-1-15**], is currently NPO with NG TFs, and we were
consulted to evaluate pt for swallow. PMH / PSH: CAD, DVT, OA
both knees, MRSA pneumonia, s/p knee/ankle/elbow sx, gum sx,
deviated septum, emphysema, (+) h/o smoking, depression

reimplantation intercostal arteries, and reimplantation of
the superior mesenteric artery, celiac access, and the right
and left renal arteries.

type B dissection, medically managed. Surgery was indicated
due to increase in size of the aneurysm to about 8 cm. The
patient was essentially asymptomatic.

History of Present Illness:
63 year old man with h/o 8cm AAA
resection with aortobifemerol graft in [**12-11**], who was diagnosed
in [**5-12**] with type B dissection from distal aorta to L subcalvian

to aortobifem graft. Pt admited [**2120-12-31**] for elective
thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair with reimplant
SMA/celiac/L renal/R renal fem-fem bypass on [**2120-12-31**].
Bronchoscopy on [**1-2**] notable for mod thin secretions and
several blood clots. Pt was reintubated due to mucus plugs,
requiring several bronchs while intubated. Pt also developed
acute renal failure, volume overload. Pt was extubated on
[**2121-1-15**]. Chest CT on [**2121-1-20**] showed bilateral effusions with
near total collapse of R lung and on [**1-22**] pt was
bronched and trached. We were consulted to assess his ability to

tolerated wearing a Passy-Muir Speaking Valve.
HPI / Subjective Complaint: 63 y/o male with 8cm AAA resection
with aortobifemoral graft in [**12-11**], but then presented to [**Hospital1 **] in
[**5-12**] with back pain. Found to have type B dissection from distal

aorta to L subclavian to aortobifem graft. Underwent
thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair with reimplant
SMA/celiac/L renal/R renal fem-fem bypass on [**12-31**]. Bronchoscopy

on [**1-2**] notable for mod thin secretions and several blood
clots.
