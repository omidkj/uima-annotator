Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD shocks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular Tachycardia ablation


History of Present Illness:
81 yr old M with a PMH of CAD, three vessel disease s/p MI and
CABG in [**2142**] and subsequent LAD bare metal stenting in [**2163**]
complicated by anteroseptal aneurysm, ventricular aneurysms and
tachycarrhythmias, chronic a. fib, systolic CHF with EF of 25%,
ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p single chamber ICD, presents with
electric shock-like pain in his chest. Reports that over the
last four weeks, he has experienced 4 electric like shocks
located in his chest, that he attributes to his ICD firing.
Reports that he may have had palpitations prior to his shocks.
These events occurred when he was sitting at rest. Denies any
lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, shortness of breath,
chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
.
Admitted to EP/[**Hospital1 1516**] service for VT ablation today ([**10-9**]). Prior
to procedure patient went into recurrent VT leading to multiple
ICD shocks. He was loaded with intravenous lidocaine with
partial success. The VT was monomorphic and he was stable
hemodynamically. He was taken to EP for repeat ablation while in
VT. During the procedure patient required neosinephrine and
dopamine to support his blood pressure. Patient was admitted to
the CCU for monitoring overnight.
.
Of note, patient underwent VT ablation in [**10-14**] with ablation of
5 areas. Patient did well afterwards on amiodarone until he
developed mixed restrictive and obstructive pattern with
decreased DlCO.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Blood cultures x2 from [**2166-10-14**]: no growth to date.

CXR [**2166-10-14**]:
INDICATION: 81-year-old male with history of ventricular
arrhythmia, now with
new fever. Evaluation for pneumonia.

TECHNIQUE: AP and lateral chest radiographs.
  COMPARISON: Portable radiograph dated [**2166-10-11**] and PA and
lateral
radiographs dated [**2166-1-24**].
  FINDINGS: There has been an interval increase in left lower
lobe atelectasis.
There is stable elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. A small
left-sided
pleural effusion cannot be fully excluded. The heart is enlarged
and stable.
There is no pneumothorax. There are three pacemaker leads
entering the right
ventricle. Sternal wires are in unchanged position.
  IMPRESSION: Interval increase in left-sided atelectasis.
  The study and the report were reviewed by the staff
radiologist.
.
EKG [**10-15**]:
Regular narrow complex rhythm. Since the previous tracing
ventricular pacing is not seen. Morphology suggests left axis
deviation. Possible myocardial
ischemia and anterior myocardial infarction. Intraventricular
conduction delay with ST-T wave abnormalities. There may be P
waves in the ST segments. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
