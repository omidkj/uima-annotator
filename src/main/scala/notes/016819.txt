CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old
male who was in his usual state of health until the day of
admission when he developed sudden onset of shortness of
breath while gardening.  The patient took two sublingual
nitroglycerin which provided him no relief and he called EMS.
In the field, the patient was found to be tachypneic with
saturations in the mid 80s and a blood pressure initially of
250/palpation.  The patient was intubated in the field for
respiratory distress.  He received Lasix 80, aspirin and
nitroglycerin in the field.  On arrival to the Emergency
Department, he received fentanyl, Versed and patient's blood
pressure dropped to 53/27.  He was started on peripheral
dopamine.  Following that, his blood pressure then bounced up
to 170s/60s and the dopamine was discontinued.  The patient
also received 80 more of intravenous Lasix in the Emergency
Department.  He put out about 500 cc with a total of 160 mg
of intravenous Lasix.  Per report, the patient denied any
chest pain, palpitations, fevers or chills prior to the
development of shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.  Last echocardiogram in [**2154-1-8**] showing an ejection fraction of 30% to 35% and
moderately dilated left atrium, moderately dilated LV,

inferior akinesis and hypokinesis of the lateral wall, 1 to
2+ mitral regurgitation.  The patient's last catheterization
was in [**Month (only) 116**] of '[**50**], which showed multi vessel disease with a
30% distal left main, proximal 30% LAD, 60% ostial RCA with a
90% proximal stenosis, a wedge of 27, an LVEDP of 20.
2.  The patient is status post AICD and pacer placement in
'[**49**] for bradycardia.

heart failure, cardiomegaly and a possible right middle lobe
infiltrate.

ADMISSION LABS:  White count 13, hematocrit 44.8, platelets
668, 64% neutrophils, 27 lymphocytes, 4 monocytes.  PT 13.9,
INR 1.3, sodium 140, potassium 4.5, chloride 102, bicarbonate

ALT 15, AST 13, alkaline phosphatase 122, magnesium 2.3,
phosphate 6.5, CK 110, MB 2 and troponin less than 0.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 82-year-old male with a
history of multivessel coronary artery disease, congestive
heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease who was admitted with pulmonary
edema requiring intubation in the field, initially on
pressors secondary to sedating medications, but pressors were
discontinued by the time the patient arrived to the CCU.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:
A.  ISCHEMIA:  Patient with known multivessel disease,
without intervention in '[**50**].  The patient denied any
proceeding chest pain as a precipitant for his congestive
heart failure.  Electrocardiogram shows a left bundle branch
block, so difficult to evaluate for ischemia.  The patient
had his cardiac enzymes cycled and his CKs peaked at 287 on
the 7th and the patient had a CK of 0.6 on the 6th.  His
electrocardiogram showed no evidence of ischemic changes.
The patient was continued on his aspirin, statin, beta
blocker and ACE were held due to his acute renal failure and
acute congestive heart failure.  The patient did have a
cardiac echocardiogram on the 6th which showed evidence of
progression of coronary artery disease.  The echocardiogram
showed multiple regional wall motion abnormalities, including
basal anterior septal akinesis, mid anterior septal akinesis,
basal inferior septal akinesis, mid inferior septal akinesis,
basal inferior akinesis, mid inferior akinesis, basal
inferior lateral akinesis, septal apex akinesis, inferior
apex akinesis and apical akinesis.  The patient's
echocardiogram also showed evidence of a worsened ejection
fraction from echocardiogram previous in [**Month (only) 404**] of this
year.  Ejection fraction on the echocardiogram done on [**2154-5-13**]
estimated ejection fraction was 15% to 20% down from previous
of 30.  Management of the patient's coronary artery disease
was discussed with the team and it was decided that at the
acute setting, a cardiac catheterization would not be
pursued.  This may be considered as an outpatient by the
patient's cardiologist and consider evaluation for coronary
artery bypass graft as per patient's cardiologist.  Prior to
discharge, the patient was able to presume Lopressor at 12.5
[**Hospital1 **].  ACE inhibitor had still not been resumed due to the
renal failure and should be resumed at the discretion of the
patient's cardiologist.

B.  PUMP:  The patient was intubated for flash pulmonary
edema.  Unclear precipitant of patient's congestive heart
failure.  No evidence of acute ischemia, however suggests
worsening coronary artery disease.  Echocardiogram on [**2154-5-13**],
showed a depressed ejection fraction of 15% to 20% and new
wall motion abnormalities as noted above.  The patient was
aggressively diuresed with Lasix.  His urine output and
oxygenation were followed.  The patient was extubated on
[**2154-5-16**].  He was placed on hydralazine and Isordil for
afterload reduction.  Lopressor was resumed when his acute
congestive heart failure resolved.  The patient was also
restarted on his outpatient Lasix dose of 40 po qd.  Weight
and urine output was monitored closely and the patient showed
no signs of congestive heart failure at the time of
discharge.

C.  RHYTHM:  The patient has a history of VT, bradycardia
with a pacemaker and AICD unplaced.  EP saw the patient and
evaluated his device.  He should follow up with his
cardiologist regarding maintenance of the device.  He was
continued on amiodarone for his hospital stay.

2.  PULMONARY:  The patient was intubated for acute
respiratory distress secondary from flash pulmonary edema.
Unclear precipitant of congestive heart failure.  The patient
was also noted to have a right middle lobe infiltrate on
chest x-ray and he completed a 10 day course of levofloxacin
and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia in the field.
He was treated with nebulizer treatments prn and his
respiratory status improved and he was extubated on the 9th.
He had no dyspnea following that.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted with a
borderline elevated white count which persisted throughout
his hospital stay.  He was treated for 10 days for an
aspiration pneumonia with levofloxacin and Flagyl.  He was
cultured on multiple days and all of his cultures were
negative, including blood, urine and sputum.  The patient had
some low grade temperatures and no source other tha
