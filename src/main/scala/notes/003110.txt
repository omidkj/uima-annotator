ADDENDUM:

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 74 year old male with metastatic
renal cell carcinoma and multiple pulmonary metastases
transferred from outside hospital [**2169-2-20**], for failure to
wean off ventilator.  Here he had two bronchial stents placed
in the left main bronchus and one in the right bronchus
intermedius.  Tracheostomy was also performed.  Despite
placement of bronchial stents, he remained unable to wean off
the ventilator.  While here, the presence of bulky metastases
was felt to compromise his respiratory failure.  During the
past ten days of his hospitalization, his respiratory status
has improved and his ventilator PEEP was weaned from 10 to 5
and his FIO2 decreased from 60 to 40 and was able to maintain
good oxygenation.  He had several tries of pressure support,
10 down from 15, but he would tire shortly after pressure
support was decreased.  Of note, his oxygenation is position
sensitive in that he has had episodes of desaturation which
subsequently resolve with suctioning and repositioning.  He
is suctioned q2-3hours and there is minimal secretion.  He
had a liter of left sided pleural effusion tapped [**2169-3-16**].
That effusion was exudative as expected.  Final results are
still pending in terms of cytology.  He received a three week
course of Ceptaz, Flagyl and Vancomycin for empiric treatment
of pneumonia.  He finished his antibiotic course [**2169-3-14**].
He has been afebrile.  He showed no signs of infection.  He
had multiple chest x-rays in house showing multiple pulmonary
opacities and bilateral air space opacities likely from his
distributed pleural effusion.  CT scan of the chest [**2169-3-14**],
showed that he had no pulmonary embolus.  It showed
mediastinal lymphadenopathy, bilateral lymphadenopathy and
multiple pulmonary masses, collapse of the left upper lobe
and extensive airway narrowing distal to his two bronchial
stents.  It also showed a left adrenal mass.  Currently, his
issues are as follows:

1.  Respiratory failure - As detailed per above.  Goals in
rehabilitation are to wean down his pressure support as
tolerated.  He also receives Flovent MDI.

2.  History of deep vein thrombosis - He is kept on Lovenox
80 mg twice a day in house.

3.  Atrial fibrillation - He remained in atrial fibrillation
while here and his heart rate was well controlled in the 70s
to 80s.  Rate agents are Lopressor 50 mg p.o. three times a
day and Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. once daily.

4.  Diastolic congestive heart failure - Cardiac
echocardiogram showed ejection fraction of 70% with
significant wall thickening, total bivalve, antibiotics,
keeping him dry.  He has been receiving 20 mg of Lasix
intravenously while here in addition to Lopressor and Digoxin
as mentioned above.

5.  History of allergies - He is on [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg p.o. twice
a day.

6.  Diabetes mellitus - Fingerstick within normal range while
here.  He required very minimal insulin coverage.  He should
not need insulin coverage at rehabilitation.

7.  Nutrition - Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was
placed.  He is on tube feeds, 60 ml/hour.  Tube feeds are at
goal.

8.  Renal - The patient had a history of renal cell
carcinoma.  Oncology team evaluated the situation and
unfortunately felt that given his refractory and progressive
nature of disease, as well as his severe debilitation that he
is not a candidate for further treatment.  His family is
aware of the situation.

9.  Other - He has not required any sedation while on the
ventilator.  He is awake, alert and comfortable and able to
communicate by writing messages.  Note that he is hard of
hearing in his left ear and often times needs to manipulate
his hearing aid prior to communicating.

10. Code Status - Code status was addressed multiple times
with the family and with the patient and it was clear that he
wants to be full code at this time.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is stable on discharge
though his overall condition is poor.  He remains ventilated,
however, is afebrile, alert and oriented times three.  He is
able to converse minimally with staff and is fully aware of
his surroundings.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to
rehabilitation facility for further treatment.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Respiratory failure, bulky metastatic disease and
compressive atelectasis.
2.  Renal cell carcinoma, metastatic disease to the lungs.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  Postobstructive pneumonia.
5.  Diastolic congestive heart failure.
6.  Atrial fibrillation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg three times a day.
2.  Digoxin 0.125 mg once daily.
3.  Lovenox 80 mg subcutaneous twice a day.
4.  Lasix 20 mg intravenously twice a day.
5.  [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg twice a day.
6.  Lansoprazole Suspension 30 mg once daily.
7.  Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer and inhalers four puffs
q4hours.
8.  Fluticasone inhaler 110 mcg four puffs twice a day.
9.  Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. q6hours p.r.n. anxiety.
10. Ambien 5 mg q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia.
11. Heparin flushes of PICC 100 units/ml 2 mg intravenously
once daily; 10ml normal saline followed by 2ml of 100
units/ml Heparin, each lumen once daily and p.r.n.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is scheduled to see
Hematology/Oncology at [**Hospital1 69**]
on [**2169-4-12**], at 4:30 p.m., Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1729**] are scheduled to see him, the fellow and primary
oncologist, telephone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5245**].
