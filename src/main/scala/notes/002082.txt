[**6-10**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Left bundle-branch block.
[**6-10**] CXR: Extensive right-sided rib fractures multiple in more
than one
place highly suggestive of a flail chest. There is also a
posteriorly layering pneumothorax.
[**6-15**] CXR: Interval removal of right-sided chest tube with
development of small apical pneumothorax. No significant
residual effusion. The heart remains mildly enlarged without
evidence for overhydration. There is also a hazy area of opacity
in the left upper lobe, which could be resolving contusion
injury; however, this should be followed to resolution. No
change to previously seen rib fractures.
[**6-16**] CXR: Stable small apical pneumothorax. F/u right lower lobe
opacity (likely pulmonary contusion) with future films.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service with right sided rib [**5-4**]
fractures, a hematocrit of 21.6 and INR 2.2. A chest tube was
placed and returned 800cc of blood from the thorax. He was
initially admitted to the trauma ICU for monitoring. His
hematocrit improved after transfer of 4 units RBCs, vit k, and
ffp. On [**6-11**], urinalysis revealed a UTI, for which he was
treated with 3 days of ciprofloxacin.
His hematocrit subsequently remained stable and gradually
increased to 34.0 on [**6-15**].

Because of his rib fractures the Acute Pain service was
consulted for epidural analgesia. The epidural catheter was
placed and remained for several days. He was later transitioned
to oral narcotics and the epidural was removed. His pain
adequately controlled on Tylenol, Tramadol, and Oxycodone prn.
He is on a bowel regimen.

Pt was previously anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation.
Because of his recent fall and hemothorax and increased risk of
similar subsequent events given pt's age and relative
instability, would recommend not restarting Coumadin for
anticoagulation in spite of pt'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] score of 4.

Physical therapy was consulted and have recommended rehab after
acute hospital stay.
