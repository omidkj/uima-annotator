HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 77-year-old white female
was prepped preoperatively for a knee replacement, and on her
preoperative work-up, she had a positive stress test on
[**2190-9-22**].  She had shortness of breath and mild
anteroseptal and apical ischemia with an ejection fraction of
62 percent.  She denied chest pain but does have a history of
congestive heart failure.

A cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 55
percent, 100 percent mid left anterior descending coronary
artery lesion, a 95 percent diagonal lesion, and 80 percent
obtuse marginal one lesion, and a subtotal mid right coronary
artery lesion.  She was admitted for elective coronary artery
bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of atrial fibrillation,
history of congestive heart failure, history of hypertension,
history of hypothyroidism, history of noninsulin dependent
diabetes mellitus, history of osteoarthritis.  She is status
post permanent pacemaker ten years ago.  She is status post
right lumpectomy.  Status post appendectomy.  Status post
cataract removal.  Status post bilateral vein stripping 40
years ago.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin 3 mg p.o. daily,
Glucotrol 2.5 mg p.o. daily, Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily,
Neurontin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d., Levoxyl 0.1 mg p.o. daily,
Diltiazem 240 mg p.o. daily, Captopril 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.,
Lasix 120 mg p.o. daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone.  Her husband passed away in
[**Name (NI) 216**].  She has children who are very involved.  She does
not smoke cigarettes.  She drinks 3-4 glasses of wine per

FAMILY HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  General:  The patient is a well-
developed, thin, elderly white female in no apparent
distress.  Vital signs stable.  Afebrile.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular movements intact.
Oropharynx benign.  Neck supple.  Full range of motion.  No
lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids 2 plus and equal
bilaterally without bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
and percussion.  Cardiovascular:  Irregular, rate, and
rhythm, with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft
and nontender with positive bowel sounds.  No masses or
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  Without clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  She had bilateral lower extremity venous
changes in her skin.  Pulses:  Femorals to 1 plus and equal
bilaterally, radials, dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial were 2
plus and equal bilaterally throughout.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted, and on [**10-12**], she
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times four with left
internal mammary artery to  the left anterior descending
coronary artery, reversed saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal, diagonal, and right coronary artery.

She was transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on no
drugs but was put on Nipride for agitation while she was
weaning.  She was attempted to be weaned that night but was
very agitated when her propofol was turned down, and she was
started on Precedex.  She also had some bleeding
postoperatively and was transfused platelets, FFP, cryo, and
packed red cells.  This eventually subsided.

On postoperative day 1, she remained on the Precedex.  Her
blood pressure was labile with a borderline cardiac index.
She was in Nipride and Nitroglycerin.  She was weaned and was
extubated on postoperative day 1.  She required aggressive
pulmonary therapy and inhalers.  She did go into atrial
fibrillation and was started back on Lopressor.

She was intermittently agitated and ended up required Ativan
drip on postoperative day 3, she was going through alcohol
withdrawal.  She also was very confused.  She had a feeding
tube placed on postoperative day 4 for fear of aspiration.
On postoperative day 5, she required reintubation and had to
back on propofol.  Her Ativan was discontinued at that point.

She also at that point then became very lethargic.  Her
propofol was discontinued.  She was seen by Neurology.  She
had a head CT at that point which was read as unremarkable.
She became more alert on postoperative day 7 and started to
be weaned again from the vent.  She was also placed back on
Precedex but became unresponsive again, and this was turned
off.

She was placed on CPAP on postoperative day 8.  She was then
also placed on heparin through this time.  She was extubated
on postoperative day 9.  She remained confused.  She also
developed a rash which was followed by Dermatology which was
felt to be a drug rash from Bactrim, and this was
discontinued.

She had a bedside swallowing evaluation where it was
determined that she could eat all things, including thin
liquids; however, she would need supervision.

She continued to require aggressive respiratory therapy and
eventually was also started back on her Lisinopril.  She
slowly progressed and was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day 13.

She continued to be disoriented and required a sitter but was
becoming slightly less agitated.  She then had a fall on
postoperative day  14 trying to get out of bed.  She had no
evidence of any injury.  She received a head CT at that point
which was negative for bleed.  We were avoiding all
psychoactive medications, and she was having physical
therapy.

She was then seen by Psychiatry who felt they wanted to have
Neurology see her.  They then saw her on postoperative day
16, and they reviewed the head CT and noted two areas of
hypodensity bilaterally in the parietal exoccipital area.
They found on their examination that she had infarct which
was giving her [**Doctor First Name **] syndrome which was corticale blindness
with cognosia.  She was reflecting her left side.  She had
superimposed confabulation, disconjugate gaze, and decreased
attention which could have been also from Wernicke's
encephalopathy.

She had been on Thiamin, but she was started back on that
again intravenous, and she could not get an MRI because of
her pacer.  This was discussed with the family by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and the team.  She was eventually weaned from her sitter and
did become more coherent and eventually knew who she was and
where she lived, and said she was in the hospital, which she
knew most of the time.

She was screened for rehabilitation.  On postoperative day
23, she was discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition.
