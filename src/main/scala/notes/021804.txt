Brief Hospital Course:
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was significant for the following
issues:

In the Emergency Department, the patient's EKG revealed atrial
fibrillation at a rate of 127 with 2.5mm ST depressions in leads
V3-V5, II, AvF. Given the patient's history, she was placed on
droplet precautions and a nasopharyngeal aspirate was performed
to evaluate for influenza.  Her EKG changes were attributed to
demand ischemia in the setting of a rapid rate. She was
continued on metoprolol and diltiazem.  On hospital day #2, the
patient's heart rate increased to the 160s and she became
increasingly short of breath and developed significant
respiratory distress. An arterial blood gas was performed and
revealed: 7.15/88/125. The patient was placed on mask
ventilation and transferred to the intensive care unit where she
was intubated.

MICU COURSE:

*Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure was
likely secondary to influenza, COPD exacerbation and flash
pulmonary edema due to AF with rapid ventricular rate.
   The patient had a DIRECT INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN TEST which was
Positive for Influenza A viral antigen.  The viral culture
revealed HEMADSORPTION POSITIVE VIRUS. She was treated with
amantadine for a total of 5 days.
   The patient was treated aggressively for COPD flare with
Solu-Medrol and frequent nebulizer treatments.  She was
transitioned to 60mg po prednisone on [**2196-1-8**]. This should be
tapered slowly over the course of [**2-4**] weeks as tolerated.
   The patient developed a new CXR opacity while in the MICU and
was treated for a superimposed bacterial pneumonia with
Vancomycin and levofloxacin. The patient developed a rash on her
trunk and extremities. The etiology of rash was not clear but
the possibility that this was an adverse reaction to Vancomycin
or Levaquin has been entertained. Skin eruption responded to
Benadryl IV and resolved by the time of transfer out of the MICU
after Abx were discontinued. She completed a course of
levofloxacin.
   The patient was extubated on [**2196-1-7**] and O2 was weaned.

*AF with RVR: The patient was initially started on a diltiazem
drip but continued to require boluses of iv metoprolol with
sub-optimal rate control. She was loaded with digoxin on [**1-6**] and
continued on digoxin.  Her rate did decrease somewhat with this
regimen. Her coumadin was continued initially but then held for
elevated INR likely from Coumadin interaction with levofloxacin.

*Hypotension: The patient was transiently hypotensive in the
MICU and required pressor support and multiple IVF boluses.
With treatment of her infection and weaning of sedation, the
patient's blood pressure normalized.

*Colonic pseudo-obstruction: The patient had severe constipation
while in the ICU likely secondary to Fentanyl effect on
intestinal motility.  She was given neostigmine with good result
and then was continued on an aggressive bowel regimen and
Reglan.

*Hyperglycemia: The patient was started on an insulin gtt for
tight glucose control.  She was transitioned to a regular
insulin sliding scale prior to transfer from the MICU.

*FEN: The patient was started on tube feeds while intubated.
After extubation, she underwent a swallowing study which
revealed no signs of aspiration but swallowing was a respiratory
demand for her and she could easily desat if feed to quickly.
Recommendations included: 1. Diet of thin liquids and pureed
solids.  Straws are okay. 2. Please feed slowly with rest
between bites/sips trying to keep sats in low 90's.


Pt was transferred to medical floor on [**2196-1-9**].  The remainder of
her hospital course was significant for the following issues.

AF with RVR: The patient was transitioned to po diltiazem,
metoprolol and digoxin.  The patient's rate was consistently in
the 105-120 range with occasional bursts to 150-160. She was
asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.  She will need to
follow up with cardiology as an outpatient and it might be worth
consider whether she is a candidate for AV node ablation with PM
placement.
   The patient's INR was elevated upon transfer from the MICU.
This elevation was thought to be due to interaction of coumadin
and levofloxacin. The patient's Coumadin was held and should
continue to be held until her INR reaches goal of [**2-4**].

CHF: The patient has a known EF of 50%.  She had some evidence
of diastolic dysfunction.  She was total body overloaded (> 10
liter positive) upon transfer from the MICU but diuresed well
with lasix.  She will need continued diuresis of 750-1L of fluid
per day until euvolemic.

COPD: She was transitioned to 60mg po prednisone on [**2196-1-8**]. This
should be tapered slowly over the course of [**2-4**] weeks as
tolerated.

Colonic pseudo-obstruction: The patient was continued on Reglan
and an aggressive bowel regimen.  She had several bowel
movements and her abdominal distention was improving.

Hyperglycemia: continued on RISS

FEN: Prior to discharge, speech and swallow were re-consulted
for evaluation

Oral Candidiasis: The patient received nystatin for mild oral
thrush.

[**1-12**] patient taken to OR
diagnosis: Perforated cecum with ileal necrosis with feculent
perforation secondary to cecal necrosis secondary to
dilatation with ischemia.

Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy and wash
out, ileal transverse ileocolostomy. There were no complications
and patient was extubated without trouble. EBL 100cc
Post operatively she was ke
