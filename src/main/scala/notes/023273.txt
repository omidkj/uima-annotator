Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  55%  >= 55%

Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity. No thrombus
in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall
normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient is in a
ventricularly paced rhythm. Results were personally reviewed
with the MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
1. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. Very small
left atrial appendage. Seen with difficulty. Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
from cardiology confirms there is no clot in the LAA.

2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

3.Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

4.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

7.There is a small pericardial effusion.

8. The left atrial appendage is ligated at the end of the
procedure.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

?????? [**2146**] CareGroup

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**11-6**] he was taken to the operating room where he underwent a
bilateral minimaze with left atrial appendage ligation, as well
as left lung biopsy with left VATS. He was transferred to the
ICU in stable condition. He was extubated later that day. His
pacemaker was interrogated by electrophysiology and he was found
to be in NSR. His chest tube was pulled without incident. He was
transferred to the floor on POD #1.
He had some short bursts of atrial fibrillation but was in NSR
under his pacemaker at the time of discharge.
Pt. is to have weekly BUN/creatinine blood tests done with
results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17025**]. He is also to have a repeat chest CT
in 3 months and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11482**] [**Name (STitle) **] opf
thoracic surgery. He is currently refusing coumadin but will
discuss it with his cardiologist.
