History of Present Illness:
86 female with severe COPD on home O2, NHL in remission on
itermittent Rituximab last [**2-/2192**], recent EVAR AAA repair
[**7-/2192**], TIA s/p LCEA, HTN who was found unresponisve on couch by
her friend and in respiratory distress. Per the patient, she had
been in her usual state of health yesterday and woke up at 0400
feeling more short pof breath and could not get back to sleep.
She had no worse cough or CP nor noted fevers or chills. She
became progressively more shoprt of breath and the last thing
she remembers was going into the den to increase her O2 to 3L
which she has rarely done. She was found by a family friend at
09:30 and after called lifeline, was found by EMS she wasn't
responding to any stimuli, attempted intubation but patient
started gagging so they decided to bag her all the way to ED.
Minimally responsive in the ED but opened eyes, said felt SOB.
Put her on CPAP for 1.5 hours and had continued to improve.
Following therapy was felt to be at baseline but stated that her
breathing was worse.
.
In the ED, initial VS: were not taken as she was a trigger and
she was found to be obtunded. Labs notable for WBC 24.8, HCT
52.1, Troponin of 0.21, creatinine of 1.5, Potassium 7.0 which
in repeat was 4.6. ECG was not changed from prior and no chest
pain. Cards took a look at it and said no indication to give
heparin. ABG: pH 7.27/63/112 HCO3 after CPAP for about 20
minutes. Repeat ABG on 4L NC was: pH7.47 pCO2 35 pO2 210 HCO3 26
BaseXS 2. Patient was given Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, Aspirin
325mg and 125mg of IV methylprednisolone. Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 653**] and said to check an IGG level and if <500 could start
IVIG if looks ill. Afebrile, no cough. 94% on 4L NC. VS on
transfer were 97.9 HR 94 142/80 sO2 94% 4LO2.

IMAGING:
[**2193-2-22**] CXR:
1. Left upper-to-mid lung opacity. Findings could be infectious,
due to
aspiration, hemorrhage not excluded.
2. Right base opacity could relate to a layering pleural
effusion, although consolidation is also likely present.
3. Numerous bilateral calcified pulmonary nodules again seen.
.
[**2193-2-25**] ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with XXX. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = XX %). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An
eccentric, XXX directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis
of the basal inferior wall. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 60 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An
eccentric, laterally directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
Eccentric jet of moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 female with severe COPD on home O2, NHL in remission on
intermittent Rituximab last [**2-/2192**], recent EVAR AAA repair
[**7-/2192**], TIA s/p LCEA, HTN, who was found unresponsive on couch
by her friend and in respiratory distress. CXR showed new
infiltrates and elevated TnT on admission which downtreneded and
likely represents non-ST elevation MI due to d
