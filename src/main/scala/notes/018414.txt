Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post fall.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
gentleman who was found at the bottom of the stairs in the
basement by a family member around 4:00 p.m. on the day of
admission.  Circumstances of the fall were unknown.  The
patient was not fully clothed.  He was last seen around noon
by family members and was in his normal state of health.

He was taken to an outside hospital, at which time he was
found to have a right subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.  He was hemodynamically stable and intubated and
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
further workup.

The patient, on arrival to [**Hospital1 **], was
sedated, intubated, and hemodynamically stable.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hyperlipidemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Zocor.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.  No ETOH use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient's temperature
was 99.5, heart rate 117, pressure 170/palpable, 98% on
assist control ventilator, GCS 80.  The pupils were 2 to 1.5
bilaterally.  Space was stable.  TMs were clear.  There was a
right scalp hematoma.  The trachea was midline.  No crepitus
deformity.  The patient was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The heart was regular.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender.  The rectal examination was heme-negative, normal
tone.  The pelvis was stable.  There was palpable DP, PT,
femoral, and radial pulses bilaterally.  The back had no
step-off or deformities.

LABORATORY DATA/OTHER STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood
count 21, hematocrit 41, platelets 301,000.  PT 13.1, PTT
22.3, INR 1.1.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.4, BUN 16, creatinine
0.8, glucose 201, calcium 1.17.  Blood gas 7.39, 40, 116, 25,
0.  Lactate was 4.1.  CK with a troponin I of 0.06.
Fibrinogen 335, amylase 220.  Serum tox was negative.

EKG showed sinus rhythm at 70 with normal axis, no ST
changes.

Chest x-ray showed ET in good position.  No pneumothorax,
clear.

Pelvic film was negative.

CT of the head showed a right subdural hematoma and a left
temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and a posterior left
frontal subarachnoid hematoma.  There was no shift.  The
ventricles were normal.

The C-spine CT was negative.  The abdomen and pelvis CT were
negative.  The TLS plain films were negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with an acute
subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  He was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit stable but intubated
for a close neurologic monitoring and careful blood pressure
control.

Neurosurgery was consulted who agreed with the current
management and felt that there was no immediate need for
surgical or an operative treatment.  The patient was stable
over the first night.  The patient had good blood pressure
control and had a repeat head CT which demonstrated no new
hemorrhages and no change in the previously seen hemorrhages.

The patient's sedation was weaned.  The patient became
increasingly alert, was following commands.  The patient did
continue to have an increased AA gradient and was hypoxemic
on the ventilator.  The patient had a chest CTA which
demonstrated multiple subsegmental pulmonary emboli
bilaterally.  He had an IVC filter placed by Interventional
Radiology and bilateral chest tubes were placed secondary to
the hypoxemia to rule out any intrapleural collections.

On SICU day number four, the chest tubes were discontinued.
The patient self-extubated and remained stable not requiring
reintubation.  He had bilateral lower extremity Doppler
studies which were negative.  The patient received pulmonary
toilet.  The patient continued to improve neurologically.

After close observation for 24 hours, the patient was felt to
be stable to be transferred to the floor.  He was diuresed
with loop diuretics from which he responded well.  The
patient's pulmonary status continued to improve.

He was transferred to the floor on hospital day number five
from which he continued to recover.  During his time on the
floor, Hematology/Oncology consult was obtained to assist in
the workup of a hypercoagulable state which may explain his
bilateral pulmonary emboli.  The workup is currently in
progress and the laboratory work is pending currently.

The patient has had a repeat head CT which is slightly
improved and not worsened.  The patient has been seen by
Physical Therapy and is receiving rehabilitation.  The
patient's diet has been advanced to a house diet with Boost
supplements which he is tolerating.  The patient has been
restarted on aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis.

The patient is now stable and ready for discharge to neuro
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post fall, unknown inciting event, with right
subdural hematoma, left intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
2.  Bilateral pulmonary emboli, status post IVC filter
placement.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Dulcolax 10 mg p.r. p.r.n.
2.  Acetaminophen 650 mg p.o. q. four hours p.r.n.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with Neurosurgery and
Trauma Clinic in approximately seven to ten days.
