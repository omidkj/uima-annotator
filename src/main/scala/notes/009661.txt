STUDY: Bedside semi-upright AP chest radiograph.

HISTORY: 71-year-old woman status post left thoracentesis.

COMPARISON: Comparison is made to chest radiograph from
[**2149-9-10**].

FINDINGS: There has been reaccumulation of moderate left-sided
pleural
effusion. Moderate right pleural effusion is also increased.
There is
associated bibasilar atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear.
Cardiac
silhouette is obscured by adjacent pleural effusions.
Mediastinal contours
are normal.

There are multiple sternotomy wires as well as midline thoracic
surgical
staples. There is moderate, unchanged scoliosis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Reaccumulation of bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
2. Otherwise, no significant change from past radiograph.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular free
wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic aortic valve
leaflets appear normal The transaortic gradient is normal for
this prosthesis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: No pericardial effusion. Small, hypertrophied left
ventricle with hyperdynamic systolic function. Mildly dilated
right ventricle with normal systolic function.
Normally-functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-7-16**],
stenotic aortic valve has been replaced with a bioprosthesis. LV
function is more vigorous, and amount of mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation has decreased. Pulmonary pressures are lower.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On day of admission she
was brought directly to the operating room where she underwent
an aortic valve replacement and ascending aorta replacement.
Please see operative note for surgical details. Following
surgery she was transferred to the CVICU with invasive
monitoring on levophed and propofol drips in stable condition.

Within 24 hours she was weaned from pressors, sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. She was transferred to
the floor on POD #2 to begin increasing her activity level.
Chest tubes and pacing wires removed per protocol.

On [**9-7**] evenings she developed atrial fibrillation and was given
a single dose of IV metoprolol to control the ventricular rate.
Amiodarone was begun (orally) and her rate remained controlled.
Electrolytes were normal during this time.  Coumadin was started
48 hours later as she continued in paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation.

On [**9-9**] her O2 saturation was noted to drop into the mid 80's
when she was taken off oxygen.  A CXR showed worsening of her
left pleural effusion and consolidation. Her left lung was
tapped for 700 ml or serosanguenous fluid. A "grapefruit sized
hematoma" was noted on her left thorax at the thoracentesis
puncture site. Chest x-ray and echocardiogram showed no acute
process.

She continued to improve and was cleared by physical therapy to
be discharged to rehab on [**2149-9-13**]. Patient needs to be on
coumadin and maintain INR>2 for atrial fibrillation
