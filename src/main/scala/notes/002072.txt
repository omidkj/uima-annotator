Service:  CARDTHOR SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 42 year old woman with
a history of multiple medical problems starting with the
following:
1.  Congenital hepatic fibrosis.
2.  Hepatitis C with demonstrated liver lesions.
3.  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
4.  History of bilateral deep venous thromboses and status
post placement of an IVC filter.
5.  History of Streptococcal infection of a dialysis
catheter.
6.  History of aortic insufficiency and mitral regurgitation.
7.  Status post splenectomy.
8.  History of intraperitoneal bleed.
9.  History of Klebsiella sepsis in [**2132-1-11**].
10. Asthma.

The patient had multiple medical admissions over the year;
the most recent one of note was for increasing shortness of
breath in [**2132-12-11**], for which she saw Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1356**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient also had a history of VRE.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Metronidazole.
2.  Neomycin.
3.  Penicillin.
4.  Sulfa.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Ambien 5 mg p.o. q. h.s.
2.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Folate 1 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Nephrocaps 1 tablet q. day.
6.  Renagel 800, four tablets three times a day.
7.  Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q. day.
8.  Zyrtec 10 mg p.o. q. day
9.  Lactulose 30 cc twice a day and three times a day.

The patient was admitted on the 13th for a work-up of her
aortic murmur and her known four plus aortic insufficiency
and three plus mitral insufficiency.  Her exercise tolerance
test had shown no perfusion defects and an ejection fraction
of 72%.  She was admitted to the Cardiology Service for
elective catheterization prior to her double-valve surgery.

Also of note was the notation that the patient's
glomerulonephritis was probably status post a Streptococcal
infection that ultimately results in end-stage renal disease
and hemodialysis.  She then developed a line infection that
gave her the endocarditis and, hence, the increasing murmurs
and insufficiency of her heart valves.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  When she was admitted to Cardiology
she was noted to be thin with a blood pressure of 124/53,
saturating 98% on room air with a heart rate in sinus at 81;
respiratory rate of 20.  Her carotids had no bruits.  She had
no jugular venous distention.  Lungs were clear anteriorly.
She did have both systolic and diastolic murmurs.  Her
abdomen was soft and nontender with good bowel sounds.  She
had no extremity edema and had bilateral distal pulses.  She
was alert and oriented.

Prior work-up had also shown an echocardiogram in [**2132-12-11**], which showed mild left atrial enlargement, symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy and a normal ejection fraction.
Her aortic valve gradient was 23 with a peak of 44 at that
time.

Her pulmonary function tests in [**Month (only) **] also of [**2132**], were
done.

On [**2133-3-18**], she had a CT scan of the chest which
showed stable tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities and the right apex was
consistent with bronchiolitis.

LABORATORY:  Prior to admission were white blood cell count
of 6.8, hematocrit of 36.6, platelet count of 348,000.
Sodium 138, potassium 5.1, chloride 104, CO2 21, BUN 26,
creatinine 8.3 with a platelet count of 73,000.  INR was 1.4.

She did also, as noted in Past History, have a history of
hepatic encephalopathy that had resolved.  She also had a
prior history of infection with Clostridium difficile.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiac catheterization was done which
showed normal coronary arteries, aortic insufficiency, mitral
regurgitation.  The patient had hemodialysis one day
preoperatively while also on the Cardiology Service and was
followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**], the Renal attending, for
monitoring of her renal status.  She did have a left arm AV
fistula in place and she was referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] of Cardiothoracic Surgery for her valve replacement.
She was also seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11442**], the Chief Resident.

Her ejection fraction was normal.  Her murmurs are radiated
to bilateral neck, Grade III/VI both systolic and diastolic.
Her last set of laboratories prior to the Operating Room was
sodium 138, potassium 4.4, chloride 103, CO2 23, BUN 30,
creatinine 8.6, white count of 5.4, blood sugar of 100,
hematocrit of 34 and platelet count of 190,000.

On[**Last Name (STitle) 32377**]5th, she underwent double valve replacement with a 19
CarboMedics mechanical aortic valve and a [**Street Address(2) 11599**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
mechanical mitral valve by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  She was
transferred to Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition on a Neo-Synephrine drip, Propofol drip and a
protenin infusion.  She was also treated perioperatively with
Linezolid for her allergies and intolerance of Vancomycin and
penicillin.

[**Last Name (STitle) **], there was concern with increased chest tube
bleeding and Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] mobilized the Operating Room
team to bring her back to explore her mediastinum to rule out
any sources of bleeding.  The patient was brought down to the
Operating Room.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was
performed which did not show an effusion and the patient's
bleeding decreased; the patient was returned to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  The patient did, over
the course of the first day, have an increased PR interval
and went into atrial fibrillation.  The patient was started
immediately on Amiodarone on postoperative day one and was
extubated.  The patient was V-paced for better control of her
rate.

She did well over the first couple of days.  She did pick up
some volume and then became a little more lethargic over the
next couple of days.  She received intravenous heparin to
cover her valves in preparation for starting her on Coumadin,
but her platelet count continued to drop.  HIT antibodies
were sent which were negative.  The patient began to require
a little bit of increased amount of pressor support other
than the Neo that the patient had come up on.  The patient
was also started on Dopamine on postoperative day six for
blood pressures that waned in the 90s over 50s.  The patient
was continually followed every day by the Renal Service.  The
Clinical Nutrition Service also saw the patient.

The patient went back into sinus rhythm after the amiodarone
was started and then went back into atrial fibrillation the
following day.  On postoperative day seven, of note, the
patient's white count rose acutely from 10.9 to 25.6, and an
Infectious Disease consultation was immediately obtained.
Also of note, the central line was pulled from the right
internal jugular site and there was some purulence at that
site.  In addition, the patient was producing some greenish
sputum.  Cultures were sent off; urinalysis was sent.  E.
coli came back in the urine.  The patient was then
immediately started on triple antibiotic therapy,
Ceftazidime, Vancomycin and Gentamicin.  The white count
decreased the next day to 17.6.  Blood cultures had all been
sent off on day six and came back with Gram negative rods.

The patient's lactate rose over the next couple of days to
7.5 and the patient started to have respiratory symptoms with
increased dyspnea as well as continuing persistent
hypotension.  The patient was restarted on CVVH on
postoperative day 10.  Pressor requirements were such that
she was now on Neo-Synephrine at 5, Dopamine at 5, and she
continued to be V-paced.  She was transfused as needed.  Her
lactate came back down slightly to 6.5.  Liver enzymes were
all elevated.  Approximately day eight, a right upper
quadrant ultrasound was obtained.  The patient's mixed venous
was also at 65% at that point.

Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from General Surgery also saw the
patient on postoperative day nine, and agreed that her
gallbladder probably needed to be drained.  This was done
under Radiology.  On that day, her total
