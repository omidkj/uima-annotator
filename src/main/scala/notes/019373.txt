Admission Date:  [**2120-8-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2120-8-21**]


Service:  MEDICINE
The patient was admitted on [**2120-8-11**], to Medical Intensive
Care Unit and transferred on [**2120-8-13**], to [**Hospital **] Medical
service.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year old
coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass
graft and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with
stenting in [**2120-7-13**], who presented to an outside hospital
on [**2120-8-11**], acutely tachypneic and hypoxic.  CT angiogram at
outside hospital demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.  Incidentally, CT scan for
abdominal aortic aneurysm.

On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient was on
100% facial nonrebreather and oxygen saturation of 96% and
respiratory rate of 20.  He was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for observation and treatment of his
pulmonary emboli.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, initially diagnosed with
positive stress test in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year.  The patient had
a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2120-7-13**],
followed by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
and stenting several days after coronary artery bypass graft.
Postoperative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation
and possible aspiration pneumonia.
2.  The patient also was recently diagnosed as being
hypothyroid.
3.  Squamous cell cancer of the left lip that was diagnosed
in [**2120-5-13**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Imdur 60 mg a day.
3.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg a day.
6.  Levoxyl 0.05 mg per day.
7.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Glyburide 1.25 mg per day.
9.  Percocet p.r.n. for pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was
afebrile with a temperature of 97.8, heart rate 84, blood
pressure 115/68, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 96%
on 100% nonrebreather.  Generally, the patient was alert,
oriented, but very tachypneic using accessory muscles to
breathe.  He was chronically ill appearing.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat - The patient had anicteric sclera.
The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.   On the
left lower lip, the patient has a 2.0 by 3.0 centimeter
ulcerating lesion with retraction.  Neck - There is no
cervical lymphadenopathy, but the patient does have a large
1.5 centimeter submandibular lymph node.  No jugular venous
distention was noted.  Lung examination - The patient had
breath sounds bilaterally with faint crackles at the bases,
expiratory wheezing throughout, no dullness to percussion.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2,
no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen revealed
normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities - The patient had no lower extremity edema and no
Homans' sign.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, sodium was 137, potassium
5.4, chloride 100, bicarbonate 24, blood urea nitrogen 29,
creatinine 1.4 which was up from the patient's baseline of
0.9 to 1.0, glucose 100, calcium 8.3, magnesium 2.3,
phosphate 4.2.  White blood cell count was 8.3, normal
differential, hematocrit 31.1.  Prothrombin time was 12.3 and
INR was 1.1.  First arterial blood gases done on 100%
nonrebreather had a pH of 7.42, pCO2 39 and pO2 of 92.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with normal axis
and first degree AV block.  There were T wave inversions in
V1 and V2 which were new since the patient's previous
electrocardiograms.  The patient also had increased ST-T wave
abnormalities in V4 through V6.

CT from the outside hospital was reviewed here and showed
multiple filling defects in branches of the left and right
pulmonary arteries and small bilateral pleural effusions that
had been present post coronary artery bypass graft.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 79 year old male who
developed dyspnea and hypoxia in coronary artery bypass graft
postoperative period with CT scan that was positive for
multiple pulmonary emboli.

1.  Pulmonary - The patient was started on Heparin for
anticoagulation and monitored in the Intensive Care Unit on
100% nonrebreather. Over the next several days, the patient
was weaned from nonrebreather face mask down to two liters of
oxygen nasal cannula where he was saturating at 93 to 94%.
The patient continued to have expiratory wheezing bilaterally
in his lung fields throughout the course of his admission and
it was felt that given the patient's long smoking history and
chest x-ray with flattened diaphragms that he probably had
some element of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  Thus, he was started on Combivent and Flovent meter
dose inhalers with some improvement in symptomatology.

2.  Cardiovascular - The patient was in normal sinus rhythm
on Amiodarone on presentation and remained in normal sinus
rhythm on telemetry, hemodynamically stable throughout the
course of his stay.  Amiodarone was stopped since it was felt
that it was probably started due to his postoperative atrial
fibrillation without events and the patient remained in
normal sinus rhythm after Amiodarone was discontinued.  In
addition to the patient's rhythm issues, given his history of
coronary artery disease and recent revascularization, he was
periodically evaluated for signs of ischemia with
electrocardiograms.  The patient remained chest pain free
throughout the course of his stay.  Electrocardiograms
throughout the course of his stay showed inverted T waves in
leads V2 through V6 that were consistent with his recent
pulmonary emboli.

Cardiac Function - The patient's preoperative echocardiogram
had showed a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction of
35%.  It was decided to reevaluate his left ventricular
function status given that he was a month postoperative from
coronary artery bypass graft.  Unfortunately, the technical
quality of the study was suboptimal and it was not possible
to reevaluate the patient's ejection fraction.

Throughout the course of his stay, the patient was gently
hydrated due to his depressed left ventricular function,
occasionally developing volume overload including rales at
his bases bilaterally for which he was gently diuresed with
Lasix p.r.n.

3.  Renal - The patient had some element of acute renal
insufficiency on presentation with an elevated creatinine.
His FENA was 0.49% as the patient was felt to be prerenal and
volume depleted.  His creatinine returned to baseline with
gentle fluid boluses over the days following admission.  The
patient's urine output was initially monitored with a Foley.
The patient had good response to fluid bolusing.  After the
Foley was removed, however, the patient had difficulty
initiating urinary stream and a tendency towards urinary
retention.  Straight catheterization produced 1900 cc of
discolored urine.  Urinalysis was sent which showed many
bacteria, [**4-16**] white blood cells and for this, the patient was
started on Ciprofloxacin to treat urinary tract infection.

Given the patient's low ejection fraction and poor cardiac
function, it was difficult to balance the patient's fluid
status throughout the course of his stay.  The patient
required multiple fluid boluses for low urine output followed
by subsequent gentle diuresis with Lasix p.r.n. for resulting
volume overload.

4.  Hematology - The patient was anticoagulated on Heparin
drip until [**2120-8-15**], at which time he was started on Lovenox
and Coumadin was started.  The patient was maintained on
Lovenox for 48 hours after his INR became therapeutic.

5.  Oncology - The patient was seen by oral head and neck
surgery service here while he was in house for evaluation of
the squamous cell cancer on his lip.  Given the [**Hospital 228**]
medical issues, surgery was declined during this hospital
stay and it was felt that the patient should follow-up as an
outpatient.  Surveillance head and neck CT scan done while
the patient was in house in addition to the ulcerative lesion
on his lip two submandibular l
