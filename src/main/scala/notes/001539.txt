wall, spinal cord, and brain p/w 2d h/o SOB, fever, and vough
productive of yellow sputum.  Pt. is s/p a recent right frontal
craniotomy and resection of metastatic tumor ([**5-19**]). He is

sat of 86% on r/a, up to 97% on non rebreather mask. He was
febrile to 101.4 and tachycardic with a heart rate of 122.  A
chest X-ray revealed a persistent opacities in the RUL and RLL
(the pt. is s/p XRT to RUL).  The RLL infiltrate was noted to be
suspicious for pneumonia.

Past Medical History:
1) Nonsmall cell lung cancer, dx'd [**2-24**], metastatic to chest
wall, also causing cord compression.  S/p steroid tx, chemotx,
and XRT.  S/p right frontal craniotomy on [**5-19**] for
metastatectomy.
2) PUD
3) hearing loss (secondary to perforated tympanic membrane)
4) COPD

Brief Hospital Course:
IMP: 76 yo male with h/o NSCLC with clinical pneumonia
(shortness of breath, hypoxia, fever, productive cough).
Likely postobstructive given lung masses.

PLAN:
1) Hypoxia: most likely secondary to combination of poor lung
substrate (COPD / lung cancer) + added insult of infection
(pneumonia).  Will provide supplemental O2 to keep sp)2 > 90,
but less than 95% given h/o COPD.  Would check ABG.

2) Pneumonia: likely postobstructive.  Would treat with
levofloxacin as well as provide anaerobic coverage with
metronidazole. Obtain sputum for gram stain and culture.  Obtain
blood cultures to monitor for dissemination.

3) Lung cancer: disseminated.  Current plans are for head XRT.
Continue steroids.

4) Brain mets:  s/p recent surgery.  Pt. to be seen by
neurosurgery.

5) COPD: underlying lung disease.  Would provide nebs prn.
Patient already on antibiotics and steroids.

6) PPx: hep sc, PPi (steroids)

7) CODE:  DNR/DNI --> had long discussion with the patient, his
wife, and his son [**Name (NI) **] (cell# [**Telephone/Fax (1) 38091**]); they do not want
his life dependent on a ventilator, should it come to that.

Hospital Course:

[**6-28**] transferred from ICU, Chest CT showed increased ground
glass opacities and interstitial infiltrates bilaterally.
[**6-22**]: did well through the day, no issues
[**6-23**]-off respiratory precautions
[**6-24**]:Improved. Likely D/c to rehab tomorrow
