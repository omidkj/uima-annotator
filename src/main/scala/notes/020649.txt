CT Abd/pelv [**2201-8-7**]: CONCLUSION:
1. Limited examination due to lack of oral and intravenous
contrast as per clinician's request. Within these limitations
there is stable appearance to the size of the abdominal aortic
aneurysm. There is extensive atherosclerosis again noted in the
abdominal and pelvic vasculature. There is no retroperitoneal
hematoma.
2. Atelectasis at the lung bases with bibasal effusions, larger
on the right.
3. Calculi in an otherwise unremarkable gallbladder.

LENIs [**2201-8-8**]: no DVT

ECHO [**2201-8-10**]: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. LVEF 50% with
normal free wall contractility. mildly dilated aortic root,
ascending aorta, aortic arch. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation.
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

EGD [**2201-8-10**]: Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus. Stomach:
Mucosa: Diffuse erythema, friability, congestion and nodularity
of the mucosa with contact bleeding were noted in the whole
stomach. The gastric folds appeared thickened and edematous
diffusely. These findings are compatible with gastritis.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum. Impression: Erythema, friability,
congestion and nodularity in the whole stomach compatible with
gastritis Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

Recommendations: PPI [**Hospital1 **]
Outpatient colonoscopy.
The source of his guaiac positive stools and melena was most
likely bleeidng from his gastritis in the setting of a
supertherapeutic INR.
Check H. pylori serology and treat if positive.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 78 y/o M with PMHx of CAD & CHF presented to
the ED c/o lower extremity edema.  In the ED he was noted to
have an acute hct drop to 22.8 from a baseline of 30 in the
setting of an INR of 4.7 (on coumadin) and guaiac positive brown
stool.
.
# UGIB: In the ED the patient's was noted to be 22.8 from his
baseline Hct 30, his INR was 4.7 and he had guaiac positive
brown stool. He was started on an IN PPI and transferred to the
ICU.  In the ICU he received a total of 4 units of pRBCs (with
IV lasix in between to prevent fluid overload given his CHF
history) and his HCT increased appropriately to 30. He remained
hemodynamically stable during his hospital stay.  His
anticoagulation was held and his INR decreased to <1.5.  On ICU
day 4, EGD by the GI consult service performed revealed
gastritis but no acute bleed. Recommended PPI [**Hospital1 **], outpatient
colonoscopy.  H pylori serology negative. Hematocrir remained
stable during this hospitalization. He will follow-up with GI as
an outpatient and should be monitored f
