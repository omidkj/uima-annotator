INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the report of the prior study (images
not
available) of [**2134-6-29**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. The IVC is
normal in
diameter with >50% decrease collapse during respiration
(estimated RAP [**4-12**]
mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional
LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). Transmitral
Doppler and TVI
c/w Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral
annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Trivial MR. LV
inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
The patient
appears to be in sinus rhythm.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated
right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity imaging
are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened with focal calcification
of the
noncoronary cusp. There is no aortic valve stenosis.Trace aortic
regurgitation
is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal left ventricular
systolic function.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of
[**2134-6-29**], there is no significant change.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-

Reason: r/o PE
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
85 year old man with concern for PE.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

EXAMINATION: CT of the chest with and without contrast dated
[**2136-1-13**].

COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen dated [**2136-1-12**].

INDICATION: Question pulmonary embolism.

TECHNIQUE: Axial imaging was obtained through the chest before
and after the administration of IV contrast.

FINDINGS FOR CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There
is heavy atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic aorta and
great vessels. There is cardiomegaly and coronary artery
calcification. There is no pericardial effusion.

After administration of IV contrast there is evidence of
thrombus in the right main pulmonary artery as well as segmental
and subsegmental branches of the right upper lobe pulmonary
arteries. No thrombus is seen within the left pulmonary
arteries. Small mediastinal lymph nodes are demonstrated which
are numerous but not enlarged by CT criteria. Scattered air
space disease is seen within the right middle lobe and right
lower lobe which may represent atelectasis, infection, or
infarction given evidence of pulmonary embolism. There is
bibasilar atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or
pleural effusion.

Limited imaging of the upper abdomen demonstrates evidence of
splenectomy with small fluid collection in the left upper
quadrant measuring 3 cm which contains gas consistent with
post-surgical changes. Small amount of fluid measuring 2.4 cm x
1.6 cm is seen adjacent to the pancreatic tail.

IMPRESSION:
1. Evidence of pulmonary embolism on the right as described with
air space consolidation within the right middle and right lower
lobes which may represent atelectasis, infection, or pulmonary
infarction given evidence of pulmonary embolism.

2. Limited evaluation of post-surgical changes in the left upper
quadrant as seen on prior CT abdomen and pelvis. Findings were
discussed with the resident taking care of the patient at
completion of the examination.

Reason: S/P RECENT SURGERY NOW TACHYPNEIC EVAL FOR PE

RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
7.1 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m MAA ([**2136-1-12**]);
44.0 mCi Tc-99m DTPA Aerosol ([**2136-1-12**]);
HISTORY: S/P RECENT SURGERY NOW TACHYPNEIC EVAL FOR PE

INTERPRETATION:
Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views
demonstrate marked
central clumping consistent with airways disease. There is
diffuse irregularity
of tracer uptake within the lung parenchyma.

Perfusion images in the same 8 views show multiple large
peripheral wedge-shaped
defects in the right lung. Perfusion irregularity of the left
lung is much less
pronounced than the right.

Chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe opacity.

While the above findings may in part be attributed to airways
disease, they are
concerning for pulmonary embolism and consistent with a
moderately high
probability for pulmonary embolism.
