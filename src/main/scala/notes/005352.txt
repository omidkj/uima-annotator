Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Mildly dilated LV
cavity. Moderately depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Significant PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. No
TEE related complications. Frequent ventricular premature beats.
patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is dilated.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35
%). After infusion of dobutamine at 2.5mcg/kg/min, LVEF improved
to 45%. There is noted apical inferior, apical anterior akinesis
and apical akinesis. The mid-papillary segments are hypokinetic.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
+eaflets are severely thickened/calcified. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. Mild (1+) pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
9. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-Bypass:
Pt removed from cardiopulmonary bypass on dobutamine gtt
2.5mcg/kg/min and phenylephrine infusion and AV paced.
1. There is a bioprosthesis in the aortic valve position. There
is good leaflet excurion, the valve is well seated, there is no
paravalvular leak or aortic regugitation. The mean gradient
across the valve is 14mmHg at CO of 3L/min.
2. Biventricular function is unchanged LVEF 35%.
3. Degree of mitral regurgitation has decreased from mild to
trivial. Pulmonic and tricuspid valves are unchanged.
4. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4020**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2184-1-15**] for elective
surgical management of his coronary artery and aortic valve
disease. He was taken directly to the operating room where he
underwent a redo sternotomy with coronary artery bypass grafting
to two vessels and an aortic valve replacement with a Biocor
porcine St. Jude valve. Postoperatively he was taken to the
cardiac surgical intensive care unit. On postoperative day one,
Mr. [**Known lastname 4020**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was extubated. He
was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. Mr.
[**Known lastname 4020**] developed some confusion with narcotics and the
