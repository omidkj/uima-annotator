                        ADDENDUM

Please note that this discharge summary is an
addendum/continuation of the discharge summary that was done
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] .................. on [**2131-8-27**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 37-year-old
white female with a long history of pulmonary issues who is
well known to the [**Hospital6 256**] and i
a patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 108610**] who was admitted on [**6-5**] for
weaning off her ventilator.  Her ventilator on admission was
CPAP with an FIO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5, and a pressure support
of 30.  She was transferred from the [**Hospital1 **]/[**Hospital1 5042**] Facility
because two weaning trials were attempted which were
unsuccessful.  Hence, it was decided that a weaning would be
carried out in the Medical Intensive Care Unit under the
supervision of her attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 108610**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Please see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
................... initial part of the discharge summary
from [**2131-8-27**].

MEDICATIONS:  Please see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] .................
discharge summary from [**2131-8-27**].

ALLERGIES:  SULFA, OXACILLIN, VERAPAMIL.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She smoked tobacco for five years while in
college.  She currently resides at the Kindres/[**Hospital1 5042**]
Facility.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Please see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] ..................
discharge summary from [**2131-8-27**], as it describes her
hospital course from the day of admission on [**2131-6-5**],
through [**2131-8-27**].  The remainder of the hospital
course is as follows:

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient has a long history of severe lung
disease.  She has a history of Hodgkin's disease and is
status post CHOP and radiation therapy complicated by
histoplasmosis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and she
is status post left pneumonectomy for Aspergillus.  She was
recently admitted in the spring for pneumonia.  She had been
on pressure support of 30 with a PEEP of 5 and an FIO2 of 40%
on her admission.  Two attempts were made at the
[**Hospital1 **]/[**Hospital1 5042**] Facility to wean her which were both
unsuccessful.

Her baseline PACO2 is in the 80s, and a renal compensation
brings her bicarbonate in the range of 40-50.  She has
tolerated this well and was able to wean from her vent.  She
was kept on a ................... while she received her
pressure support via tracheostomy at night.  She had a
tracheostomy revision on [**2131-7-2**], and was found to have
a posterior tracheal ulcer which was a very early TE fistula.
She had a temporary tracheostomy which was changed to
permanent on [**2131-7-12**].  A bronchoscopy after that showed
that the ulcer had healed.

The patient is currently using a TP with an FIO2 of 50%
during the day time, and at night she uses a BIPAP with an
EPAP of 6 and an IPAP of 12.  The plan is to send her back to
her rehabilitation center where she will remain on her The
patient during the day with blow-by oxygen and will remain on
the BIPAP at night on her home ventilator.

2.  Cardiac:  The patient has a history of biventricular
congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy and is known to
have an ejection fraction close to 20%.  Her left-sided heart
failure is thought to be secondary to tachycardia inducing
cardiomyopathy, and her right heart failure is thought to be
secondary to cor pulmonale.  Her resting pulse ranges
anywhere between 100-120s and is sinus tachycardia, and based
on previous experience, it has shown that any decrease or
increase from this resting heart rate, can send her into
respiratory distress and cause decompensation.  She is also
very volume sensitive, and given that she has biventricular
heart failure, our goal is to keep her weight between 150-120
lbs.  In addition, she is on a regimen of Lasix, Metolazone,
and Aldactone to help control her volume status.

She remains at her baseline goal weight between 150-120 lbs
on this diuresis regimen, and she does not appear to have any
respiratory distress.  The patient is also on Digoxin 0.125
mg every other day and 0.25 mg every other day.  She does
have her Digoxin level checked and should be checked on a
regular basis.

Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient is known to
have a volatile/fluctuating potassium level.  She has a
history of constipation and sometimes develops hyperkalemia
from her inability to excrete her potassium to her GI tract.
In addition, with her large diuresis, she also is known to
drop her potassium level significantly in the range of
2.4-2.5.  To help maintain her potassium at a reasonable
level since she is on Digoxin, she is taking 40 mEq Potassium
Chloride t.i.d., and her potassium level has remained
relatively stable in that we had been checking it twice a
day, and it ranges from 3.1 to 4.0 with this current regimen
in addition to the Lasix, Metolazone, and Aldactone she is
taking.

Her nutrition is delivered to her via her G-tube with a
.................. tube feeds.  The patient also has a
baseline metabolic alkalosis as mentioned early on with
bicarbs of 40-50 to compensate for her severely impaired and
decreased ventilation.  She has a significant amount of large
dead space and a VD/VT ratio of 0.8.  She is tolerating this
metabolic alkalosis well.

Gastrointestinal:  As mentioned, the patient has a history of
constipation, especially when she uses narcotic analgesics.
She had been on Percocet for pain experienced from her
tracheostomy site.  She has had some bowel movements since
Dr. ................. discharge summary of [**8-27**], and
her potassium levels have been relatively stable in the range
of 3.0-4.0.  In addition, she is getting Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., and she is getting Senna tabs and Simethicone.  We
are being very aggressive with her bowel regimen to help
maintain and regulate bowel movements.

Infectious disease:  Given the patient's significant
pulmonary history, she was taking inhaled Tobramycin for
pseudomonas prophylaxis.  She was taking this for 28 days and
then tried off for 21 days in which it was found that her
white blood count was increasing, and the Tobramycin was
restarted.

She does have a history of chronic leukocytosis from [**12-7**],
but no specific signs of infection from her baseline was
noted.  On [**9-6**], she was found to have 15 bands on
her CBC, and she was found to have a positive urinalysis, and
she was started on Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d.  In addition on
[**9-6**], she grew coag-negative staph from her PICC line
and was started on Vancomycin because it was sensitive to
that.  On [**9-9**], her urine culture came back negative,
and so the Levaquin was discontinued, but she continued to
receive Vancomycin 1 g q.12 hours for a total of seven days;
on the day of discharge, it will be day #5 of 7.

Psychiatry:  The patient has a history of anxiety attacks
with complicated respiratory failure.  It was thought that
the anxiety was a large component of this failure.  She was
relying on multiple pain medications which had been
discontinued due to her constipation and other problems.  She
seems to be doing well on a regimen of Amitriptyline 75 mg
q.h.s., Zyprexa 5 mg q.h.s., and she occasionally gets Ativan
p.r.n.

Tubes, lines, and drains:  A central line was placed due to
the PICC line infection; however, since she is a very
difficult stick and she need to get her blood checked on a
regular basis, a right PICC line is going to be placed by
Interventional Radiology, and the subclavian is going to be
removed prior to her discharge.  She also has a tracheostomy
and G-tube, and all of these sites are clean, dry, and
intact.

Prophylaxis:  The patient is able to get out of bed with
physical therapy and Occupational Therapy.  She is also
getting a PPI per her G-tube.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is stable.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is being discharged to either
[**Hospital3 4419**] facility or the [**Hospital1 **]/[**Hospital1 5042**]
Facility depending on bed availability.
