Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Penicillins / Cephalosporins / ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortic valve replacement 25-mm Biocor apical tissue heart valve


History of Present Illness:
79 year old male with moderate to severe aortic regurgitation
with associated fatigue, dyspnea and neck pain was admitted
preoperatively for an Aortic Valve Replacement on [**2182-5-9**]. He
was
placed on heparin drip for Coumadin washout for paroxysmal
Atrial
Fibrillation. Initial labs were drawn and revealed neutropenia
and an elevated creatnine from baseline. Based on Mr.[**Known lastname 101329**]
history of renal transplant, the Renal Transplant Service was
consulted. His medications were reviewed and recommendations
were
made. His Cyclosporine and prednisone were continued.
Azathioprine and Colchicine were discontinued per renal. Labs
were monitored. His Creatnine drifted down to 1.5 and WBC ct=1.5
on [**5-14**]. The decision was made to rescreen
Mr.[**Known lastname 57554**] for rehab with postponement of his AVR until his
lab values trend towards normalizing. He returns to [**Hospital1 18**] today
for heparin bridge preop AVR/? Asc.Ao.Replacement with
normalizing lab values.


Past Medical History:
1.  Moderate-to-severe aortic insufficiency with dilating LV,
currently be evaluated for valve replacement by cardiac surgery.
2.  Recent cardiac catheterization showing no obstructive
coronary artery disease, however, found to have elevated filling
pressures, requiring diuresis.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Kidney transplant in [**2155**] due to PCKD, the baseline
creatinine approximately 1.6.
5.  Hyperlipidemia.
6.  Peripheral neuropathy.
7.  Diverticulitis.
8.  Pseudogout.
9.  Osteoporosis.
10.  Atrial fibrillation, currently on Coumadin for
thromboembolic prophylaxis.

Social History:
Patient previously worked as an engineer for channel 5. He
currently lives in a house himself. His wife passed away 9 years
ago. Prior history of 3 ppd X 20 years, quitting 34 years ago.
Occasional ETOH (few beers per week). No illicits. His daughters
([**Name2 (NI) **] (daughter) - ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 101330**], [**Female First Name (un) **] (daughter)
[**0-0-**]) are very involved.


Family History:
No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or
sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Written informed consent was obtained from the
patient. A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I
certify I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast
is present in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. The left ventricular
systolic function is globally mildly depressed, estimated
EF=45%. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is
seen.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with focal
calcifications. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

There is a small pericardial effusion. There is a small left
pleural effusion.

Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of
study.

POST-CPB:
The patient is on no vasopressors. A bioprosthetic valve is seen
in the aortic position. The valve is well seated with normally
mobile leaflets. There are no apparent paravalvular leaks. There
is no AI. The peak gradient across the aortic valve is 13mmHg,
the mean gradient is 6mmHg with CO of 3.8L/min.

The inferior and inferoseptal segments of the left ventricle
appears hypoknetic. This improves with time but is still more
notable than pre-bypass. Overal left ventricular systolic
function remains mildly depressed, estimated EF 40-45%. The RV
systolic function remains normal.

The MR remains trace. Other valvular function is unchanged.

The small left pleural effusion remains. There is no evidence of
aortic dissection.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pre-op MSSA screen was positive and the patient was treated with
Mupirocin.  Additionally, on admission his INR was
supratherapeutic.  He was given Vitamin K and FFP.  INR would
trend down and on [**2182-6-27**] Mr.[**Name14 (STitle) 101332**] was taken to the operating
room where he underwent Aortic valve replacement 25-mm Biocor
apical tissue heart valve with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see operative
report for surgical details. He tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to CVICU intubated and sedated for invasive
monitoring. He awoke neurologically intact and extubated. He
weaned off pressor support and Beta-blocker/Statin/diuresis was
initiated.  Renal continued to follow the patient.  Coumadin was
resumed for chronic AFib.
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By
the time of dischar
