This 78 year old white female presented elsewhere with chest
pain awakening her.  She had associated diaphoresis and after
receiving nitoglycerine she was hypotensive, requiring fluids.
Her pain resolved, she was stable and ruled in for an a non ST
infarction.  Catheterization revealed single vessel disease and
critical aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8).  She was transferred for
cardiac surgery.

NEURO: Nonfocal


Pertinent Results:
[**2116-10-23**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:

The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate
valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Moderate ([**12-25**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS:

Left and right ventricular function is preserved. The aorta is
intact. An aortic bioprosthesis is well seated with good leaflet
excursion. There is no AI. The aortic valve gradients are
appropriate. Mitral regurgitation is mild to moderate. The
remainder of the examination is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission she received dental clearance and carotid
ultrasonography. There was no contraindication for surgery.  On
[**10-23**] she went to the operating room where aortic valve
replacement and a single graft were done. See operative note for
details.
She weaned from bypass on Neosynephrine and propofol and was
sent to the CVICU in stable condition.

She weaned from pressors, awoke intact and was extubated.  She
developed rapid atrial fibrillation, requiring amiodarone and
beta blockers to control ventricular response and convert to
sinus.  Coumadin was started, as the patient would vascillate
between SR and Afib.  She made excellent progress with physical
therapy, showing good strength and balance before discharge.
The patient was diuresed toward her preoperative weight.  She
was discharged in good condition to home on POD9.
