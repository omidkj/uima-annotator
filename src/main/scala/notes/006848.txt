History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 46 year-old man with a PMHx significant for HIV
(dx'd [**2089**], CD4 260 in [**7-/2106**], last VL [**2104**] was [**Numeric Identifier **], self
d/c'd HARRT in mid [**2105**] [**12-22**] financial difficulty, no history of
opportunistic infections) in USOH until one month prior to
presentation when he began to develop myalgias, fevers, chills,
progressive DOE, PND, and eventually orthopnea. Over this month
he also had multiple episodes of vomiting and weight loss. He
saw his PCP two weeks prior to presentation regarding these
symptoms. A CXR showed an upper lobe infiltrate, and he was
treated with a Z-Pac, without symptomatic improvement. He was
referred to the ED for further evaluation on [**2106-12-7**].

In the ED, EKG revealed ST elevation in the anterior leads. A
CXR showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates.

[**2106-12-7**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
  1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right
dominant system
with a ramus branch and one vessel CAD. The left main was a long
vessel
with mild plaquing. The LAD had an ostial subtotal occlusion and
a
proximal total occlusion. The distal LAD filled faintly by left
to left
collaterals. The LCx was modest AV groove vessel with small OM
branches. The ramus intermedius was large with a 30% mid vessel
lesion.
The RCA had diffuse plaquing to 30% proximally. There were some
septals
providing collateral flow to the LAD.
  2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated cardiogenic shock. Right
sided filling pressures were markedly elevated with a mean RA
pressure
18 mm Hg.  Left sided filling pressures were also elevated with
a mean
PCW pressure of 24 mm Hg and LVEDP of 23 mm Hg. Cardiac index
was
markedly depressed at 1.0 L/min/m2, based on an assumed oxygen
consumption index. There was no evidenc of a gradient across the
aortic
valve on pullback of the pigtail catheter from the left
ventricle.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension was present.
  3. An 8 French 40 cc intra-aortic balloon pump was placed via
the
right common femoral artery. There was appropriate augmentation
of the
diastolic pressure and unloading of the ventricle. After balloon

augmentation, the cardiac index rose to 1.8 L/min/m2.
  4. Successful PCI of the proximal LAD with a 2.0 x 18 mm Pixel
stent,
post-dilated with a 2.5 mm balloon at 18 atm (see PTCA
comments).
  5. Abdominal aortography was performed with a 4 French Tennis
Racquet
catheter using 30 cc of contrast at 15 cc/second.  There was
adequate
runoff with mild diffuse plaquing in the bilateral iliac and
right
common femoral arteries despite the presence of the IABP sheath.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel CAD.
2. Cardiogenic shock.
3. Successfl PCI of the LAD for acute anterior myocardial
infarction.

[**2106-12-8**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. A patent foramen ovale is present.
The inferior vena cava is dilated (>2.5 cm). The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
LV hypokinesis with distal septal and apical dyskinesis. The
basal to middle septum is thinned and akinetic. A large,
non-mobile thrombus is seen in the left ventriclar apex (2.0 x
3.0 cm) extending down the distal septum. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.


[**2106-12-14**] CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Bilateral axillary,
left internal mammary, precarinal, and subcarinal
lymphadenopathy is again noted, unchanged since the prior study.
Left subclavian approach Swan-Ganz catheter terminates within
the left main pulmonary artery. A focal area of soft tissue
within the left ventricular cavity presumably represents the
patient's known thrombus. The heart is enlarged but there is no
pericardial effusion. The appearance of the lungs is unchanged
since the prior study. Again, seen are multifocal areas of
parenchymal opacification in a peribronchovascular distribution
as well as smaller nodular opacities. Peripheral left basilar
opacities are again identified associated with a small amount of
pleural fluid. The airways remain patent to the level of the
subsegmental bronchi bilaterally.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Oblong hypodensity extending
from the splenic hilum to the posterior aspect of the spleen
likely represents a splenic infarct. A smaller area of decreased
attenuation is identified as well. The splenic vein and artery
appear patent. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands,
and right kidney appear grossly normal. There is a peripheral
area of hypodensity involving the left kidney in a single image,
possib ly representing a renal infarct. Left kidney otherwise
enhances and excretes contrast. Stomach and visualized loops of
small and large bowel are unremarkable. The aorta and its major
intra- abdominal branches appear patent. There is no free fluid
within the abdomen.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A small focus of gas within
the urinary bladder, presumably related to prior
instrumentation. The distal ureters, seminal vesicles, and
pelvic loops of bowel appear grossly normal. There is no free
fluid within the pelvis.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1) Unchanged appearance of bilateral peribronchovascular
airspace opacities as well as multiple peripheral poorly defined
nodular opacities. Differential diagnosis remains unchanged and
includes infection, septic emboli, cryptogenic organizing
pneumonia, and vasculitis.
2) Stable appearance of mediastinal and axillary
lymphadenopathy.
3) Findings consistent with splenic infarcts involving the
posterior aspect of the spleen.
4) Focal area of hyperperfusion within the lateral mid pole of
the left kidney possibly an infarct.
5) Ill-defined soft tissue within the left ventricle presumably
represents the patient's known left ventricular thrombus.

[**2106-12-17**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: There is no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of
normally midline structures, minor or major vascular territorial
infarct. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
