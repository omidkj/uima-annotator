IMAGING:
CTA chest [**2138-8-12**]
1.  Limited evaluation for PE.  No large main or segmental
pulmonary embolism.
2.  Small pleural effusions and perifissural fluid.
3.  Enlarged pulmonary artery can be seen in pulmonary
hypertension.
4.  Extensive irregular calcified and noncalcified
atherosclerotic plaque of the descending aorta.

TTE [**2138-8-12**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II
(moderate) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with normal free wall contractility. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

NOTE: Report edited at 6:21 pm on [**2138-8-12**] to remove mention of
lack of spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium (this could
not be adequately assessed).

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 79401**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with hx of OSA, HTN, GERD, OA who
presented after a mechanical fall resulting in a left hip
fracture.  Hip Surgery was performed on [**8-11**], and patient
required ICU admission post-operatively because of poor
respiratory status.
.
## LEFT FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE (s/p Hemiarthroplasty on [**2138-8-11**]):
The surgery proceeded without any major complications.
Post-operatively the patient was not extubated due to poor
respiratory status and she was transferred to the medical ICU.
In the ICU, her respiratory status rapidly improved and she self
extubated on the morning of [**8-12**].  She started working with
physical therapy shortly therefater. She will need 2 weeks of
lovenox post operatively for DVT prophylaxis. She will follow-up
in orthopedics clinic in ~2 weeks as scheduled.
.
## HYPOXEMIA - The patient has hypoxemia at baseline. She
reports that her oxygen saturation on room air is normally "Very
Low" at home. She wears 3 liters of nasal cannula at night
normally. Her chronic hypoxemia is likely from obstructive sleep
apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. CTA and TTE during
this admission showed pulmonary hypertension which is likely
from chronic hypoxemia. She likely also had some acute insults
superimposed including post-op atelectasis due to pain and
shallow breathing. Workup for other contributing factors
included a CTA which was negative for PE. A chest x-ray
indicated a possible aspiration pneumonia and therefore the
patient was started on clindamycin.  She has two days remaining
of a 7 day course.  She was able to be weaned to 4L NC by
discharge.
.
CHRONIC MED CONDITIONS
## GERD - continue home dose of omeprazole
.
## LE edema - trace edema on exam. will continue home lasix

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Last Name (Titles) 79402**], it was a pleasure taking care of you here at
[**Hospital1 18**]. You were admitted to the hospital after you fractured
your hip. Afterwards, you came to the medical instensive care
unit because you required a higher than normal breathing support
to maintain normal oxygen levels.  We are also treating you with
2 more days of antibiotics for a pneumo
