Final Report
AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2187-4-27**] AT [**2186**] HOURS.

HISTORY: Head injury, post-intubation.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: An endotracheal tube is present with the distal tip in
satisfactory position approximately 4.8 cm from the carina. A
nasogastric tube is noted extending into the left upper quadrant
off the inferior edge of the radiograph. The lungs are grossly
clear with linear lines noted at the right lung base, likely
atelectasis versus scarring. There is marked aortic tortuosity.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size. No
effusion or pneumothorax is noted. Overall, there is marked
hyperexpansion of the lungs.

IMPRESSION: Marked hyperexpansion. Marked tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta. Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position.

No fracture or malalignment. DJD mid cervical spine with minimal
canal
narrowing.


Final Report
INDICATION: 75-year-old woman status post fall.

COMPARISON: CT C-spine obtained at [**Hospital **] Hospital
approximately six hours earlier.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
cervical spine.
Multiplanar reformatted images were generated. No contrast was
administered.

FINDINGS: There has been interval endotracheal intubation and
nasogastric
tube placement. There is no fracture or acute malalignment of
the cervical
spine. Moderate degenerative changes are present in the upper
and mid
cervical spine, with mild, grade 1 anterolisthesis of the C3 on
C4. There is pronounced loss of intervertebral disc height
between C4 and C7, with
posterior disc osteophyte complexes at these levels, slightly
narrowing the spinal canal, and contacting the thecal sac.
Prevertebral soft tissues are within normal limits given the
presence of an endotracheal tube. Vertebral body heights are
preserved.

Lung apices demonstrate marked emphysema. Multifocal
hypodensities within the thyroid gland are present. There is no
lymphadenopathy within the neck, by size criteria. Vascular
calcifications are present.

IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or acute malalignment of the cervical spine.
2. Moderate degenerative changes result in posterior disc
osteophyte
complexes in the mid cervical spine that contacts the thecal
sac. MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of the thecal sac and
its contents.
3. Emphysema.
4. Thyroid hypodensities. Recommend clinical correlation and
ultrasound
evaluation if not previously performed, on a non-emergent basis.



The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

11x6mm hyperdensity left temporal lobe could be small
hemorrhagic contusion, but lack of associated traumatic findings
makes this less likely. Cannot rule out metastasis from occult
primary. Recommend f/u imaging to assess for evolution.


Final Report
INDICATION: 75-year-old woman with seizure and suspected
temporal hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: Head CT obtained at [**Hospital **] Hospital approximately
six hours
earlier.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
brain. No
contrast was administered. Multiplanar reformatted images were
generated.

FINDINGS: In the left mid temporal lobe, there is a 12 x 7 mm
ovoid
hyperdense lesion, without surrounding edema
