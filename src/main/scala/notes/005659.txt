History of Present Illness:
77 year old male with known aortic stenosis diagnosed 5 years
ago who has been followed with serial echocardiograms for
progressively worsening aortic stenosis. He has had vague
symptoms of dyspnea on exertion with a recent episode of chest
discomfort. His most recent echocardiogram demonstrated severe
aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.9cm2 and mean gradient of 92
mmHg. Given the severity of his aortic stenosis, he was referred
for surgical evaluation. Cath revealed minimal coronary disease.
He was admitted for AVR.

Carotid Bruit        Bilateral: Transmitted vs. Bruit

Pertinent Results:
[**11-30**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant system does not demonstrate angiographically apparent
flow limiting disease in any of the major epicardial coronary
arteries. There is a 20% lesion in the distal left main coronary
artery. The LAD contains luminal
irregularities that approach a 25% stenosis just after the D1
bifurcation. The circummflex aftery supplies 6 short obtuse
marginal arteries and a large atrial branch. The right [**Last Name (un) **]
artery gives rise to a large branching posterior descending
artery with a 40% stenosis in the first side branch. 2. Limited
resting hemodynamics demonstrate low-normal systemic blood
pressures. 3. Successful hemostasis with TR band.
[**11-30**] Carotid U/S: Less than 40% stenosis of the bilateral
extracranial internal carotid arteries.
[**12-4**] CXR: Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Small bilateral
pleural effusions and mild-to-moderate bibasilar atelectasis
which worsened from [**12-2**] to [**12-3**] is subsequently
unchanged. No pneumothorax. There is no pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2105-12-1**] where the patient underwent [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6158**]
[**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue Aortic Valve replacement. Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.   POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  He did develop rapid atrial fibrillation and was
treated with magnesium and beta blockers and converted to sinus
rhythm.  He did have a leukocytosis to 18,000 and his central
line was discontinued.  His WBC was decreasing on no antibiotics
at the time of discharge.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged home with VNA
services in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
