Service:  MED


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year old female
with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome transformed into
acute myelogenous leukemia (type M6A) diagnosed one month ago
who was initially admitted for treatment with low-dose Ara-C
and Hydroxyurea.  Her disease was initially diagnosed
secondary to pancytopenia with circulating blast forms and a
bone marrow in [**2182-5-9**].  She was initially treated with
Procrit and weekly transfusions with packed red blood cells
and Danazol from which she developed an allergic reaction.
Over the last week prior to admission, she developed
increased fatigue.  Repeat bone marrow showed 7 percent to 10
percent myeloblasts.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above, history of myelodysplastic
syndrome transformed into acute myelogenous leukemia.  No
prior surgeries or prior hospitalizations.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Procrit 40,000 units every week
and Tylenol as needed.

ALLERGIES:  DANAZOL (causes facial swelling and periorbital
edema).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  A 70-pack-year smoking history; currently
smokes half a pack per day.  Three drinks of alcohol per
night.  She is a retired office manager.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Sister deceased from a central nervous
system aneurysm.  Brother deceased from coronary artery
disease.  She has one daughter and one son.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY ISSUES:  The patient was initially
   admitted on to the Bone Marrow Transplant Service.  She
   was treated with 13 days of low-dose Ara-C as well as
   Hydroxyurea.  She was treated initially with a one time
   dose of GM-CSF which was then discontinued secondary to
   fevers.  the patient did not show any signs of tumor lysis
   by laboratories.  Currently waiting for counts to recover.

1. FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA ISSUES:  The patient had fevers up to
   103 as well as neutropenia.  She was originally started on
   cefepime, fluconazole, and vancomycin.  The cefepime was
   discontinued and switched to aztreonam because of a
   diffuse rash.  AmBisome was eventually started for
   continued fevers, but then discontinued secondary to acute
   renal failure and switched to voriconazole.

Vancomycin levels have been very elevated and was being dosed
by levels.  The blood cultures have remained negative to
date.  A chest x-ray did not show any infiltrates.  Urine
cultures from [**7-28**] grew 10:100,000 enterococcus with
sensitivities pending.  The patient was empirically started
on linezolid, and the vancomycin was discontinued.

1. GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  In the setting of
   thrombocytopenia, the patient developed melanotic stools
   on the Bone Marrow Transplant floor.  She remained
   hemodynamically stable and was transferred the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**]
   Intensive Care Unit for better monitoring.  Her platelets
   were kept above 50 and her hematocrit above 25.  She
   continued to have a slow gastrointestinal bleed.
   Gastroenterology was consulted and is following, holding
   off on colonoscope at this time.  She given vitamin K, as
   well as amicrobic acid, and Protonix twice per day.  She
   requires HLA typed and matched platelets secondary to
   antibodies.

1. HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient developed hypotension
   with mean arterial pressures in the 40s; asymptomatic.
   She was given multiple boluses of intravenous fluids
   without significant improvement in her pressures.  The
   differential diagnoses included sepsis, gastrointestinal
   bleed, excessive losses from fever and rash as well as
   capillary leak syndrome.  She was started on low-dose
   dopamine for renal perfusion.

1. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient developed acute
   renal failure with a creatinine of up to 3.2.  The Renal
   Service was consulted.  Urine sediment showed muddy brown
   casts.  The likely insult was hypotension in the setting
   of a gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient continues to
   oliguric with improvement in the urine output with a low-
   dose dopamine drip.  Urine also showed eosinophils -
   possible acute interstitial nephritis from multiple drugs.
   The patient was started on a trial of prednisone.  The
   patient was also started on Bicitra 30 twice per day.

1. PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was continued on albuterol
   and Atrovent nebulizers for chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease seen on computerized axial tomography with a
   longstanding history of smoking.

1. RASH ISSUES:  The patient developed a diffuse erythematous
   blanching rash which was likely secondary to drug effect -
   cefepime versus vancomycin.  The Dermatology Service was
   consulted, and a biopsy was consistent with
   hypersensitivity reaction.  The patient was started
   clobetasol and bacitracin topically as well as Sarna
   lotion for pruritus.

1. FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was
   continued on a full liquid diet.  Electrolytes were
   repleted once per day.  She was maintained on maintenance
   fluids.

1. PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  Proton pump inhibitor and bowel
   regimen.

1. ACCESS ISSUES:  Hickman catheter and peripheral lines.

1. CONTACT ISSUES:  Son and daughter.

1. CODE STATUS ISSUES:  Do not resuscitate/do not intubate.

The rest of the hospital course will be dictated by the next
Intensive Care Unit intern.
