Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker placement [**4-7**]

History of Present Illness:
66 year old man with CAD s/p CABG and mechanical AVR in [**2142**],
with multiple medical problems who has been hospitalized
frequently in the past year, presented to OSH with chest pain
and SOB on [**3-19**]. He was diagnosed with PNA and ruled out for MI.
He completed a course of azithro and CTX and was ready for
rehab.
.
On [**3-27**], reports say that he was walking in the hallway when he
had a vfib arrest. He was defibrillated and subsequently
developed PEA arrest and bradycardia. Epi was given and he was
intubated and sent to the CCU at OSH. Temporary pacing wires
were placed. His vfib arrest may have been due to hyperkalemia
(K=6.1) although he did not have any EKG changes prior to
arrest. He was also on dopamine.
.
Neurology consult was called and they did not note any focal
neurological deficits while he was intubated. Cardiology consult
was called and they believed he may need an ICD for his vfib
arrest.
On [**3-31**], he was extubated and dopamine was stopped. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath and ICD placement.

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2145-3-31**] 11:01 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: assess for CHF and line placement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
66 year old man with vfib arrest xfer from OSH with central
lines
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for CHF and line placement
HISTORY: Ventricular fibrillation and arrest, transferred from
outside hospital. To assess for congestive failure and line
placement.

FINDINGS: No previous images. There are intact sternal sutures
in a patient with previous CABG and a prosthetic valve. There is
substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with a
plethora of ill-defined pulmonary vessels consistent with
vascular congestion. Some areas of increased opacification at
the bases could reflect atelectasis, though the possibility of
supervening infection cannot be excluded.

Right IJ catheter which could be a lead with a metallic tip
extends to the region of the apex of the right ventricle. A left
subclavian catheter does not appear to cross the midline.

Of incidental note are surgical clips overlying the right
axillary region.
.
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had a 20% stenosis.
The LAD
had a 50% mid-vessel stenosis and an 80% origin stenosis of a
moderate-sized Diagonal-1 branch.  The LCx had a 50% origin
stenosis
after a large patent ramus intermedius.  The RCA had mild
diffuse
disease in the proximal segment and moderate diffuse disease in
the
stented segment distally, up to 50% stenosis.  The PDA was
occluded.
2. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a patent LIMA-LAD.
3. Graft angiography demonstrated a patent SVG-PDA.  The PDA was
small.
4. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressure with a central aortic BP of 125/63 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD and SVG-rPDA.
.
ECG
Underlying rhythm is sinus rhythm with prolonged A-V conduction.
P-R interval measures approximately 270 milliseconds and is
further prolonged following premature complexes. Two atrial
premature beats, one aberrantly conducted, are noted. Underlying
QRS pattern is right bundle-branch block with left anterior
hemi-block. Diffuse, but especially lateral, ST-T wave changes
are seen and may represent myocardial hypertrophy and/or
ischemia.

Echo:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior and
inferolateral severe hypokinesis/akinesis. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 50%). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with focal basal free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus
level. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Dilated right ventricle with mild systolic dysfunction.
Normally-functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis. Mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.




Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old male with CAD s/p CABG and mechanical AVR p/w
syncope, found to have 1st degree heart block, in addition to
left anterior fascicular block and RBBB.
.
# Heart Block:   The diagnosis of ventricular fibrillation from
the outside hospital was in doubt, given that no tele strips or
ekg's were produced which detected ventricular tachycardia or
ventricular fibrillation. Given this information, and the fact
that his ekg continued to show first degree heart block, left
anterior fascicular block, and right bundle branch block, it was
thought that the patient's episode at the outside hospital was
secondary to syncope from bradycardia. In addition, cardiac
catheterization showed diffuse three vessel disease but [**Last Name (un) **]
active lesions which may have precipitated an ischemic event.
Therefore, it was decided not to implant an ICD. The patient was
kept on a temporary pacer for the first several days of
admission. The patient's native heart rate eventually outpaced
the pacer, at a rate ranging in the 50's, and his temporary
pacer was removed. He remained with a heart rate in the 50's
over the next several days. He was asymptomatic at rest.
However, he continued to have heart rates as low as the 20's and
30's, and was developing frequent [**1-17**] second pauses while being
monitored on telemetry.  Therefore, a dual chamber pacemaker at
setting DDD was placed on [**4-8**].  On [**4-9**], he began having runs
of atrial tachycardia in the 120-130's, secondary to atrial
sensed ventricular pacing. His pacemaker setting was therefore
changed to DDI, and he did not experience further tachycardia.
The pacemaker implantation was without complications. He was
continued on IV heparin and transitioned to PO coumadin.  His
goal INR is 2.5 to 3.5.
