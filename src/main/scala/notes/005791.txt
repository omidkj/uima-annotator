Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**1-8**] small bowel resection

History of Present Illness:
*limited due to intubated and sedated status, history
predominantly obtained through his wife*
87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since
reversed), who presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days
duration. [**Name (NI) **] wife reports that the patient is typically
without complaints and when is is sick, he rarely complains
about symptoms. He has been eating less and looking more
lethargic to his wife; however, he has not had any nausea or
vomiting. His wife feels that he has been dehydrated in the last
few days. He first complained of abdominal pain the day prior to
presentation and initially did not want to go to the hospital;
however, his wife encouraged him to go.
.
In the emergency department, VS were: T 96, HR 80, BP 84/48, RR
20, O2Sat 92% on RA. Lactate was elevated at 5. He was evaluated
by surgery, who felt he had an SBO and were concerned for
ischemic bowel. He was therefore brought directly to the OR
where an exploratory laparotomy was performed. Intraoperatively,
patient received 3 liters of crystalloid with EBL of 50 mL and
UOP of 20 mL.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient was intubated and sedated.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since
reversed), who presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days
duration.

# Hypotension:  Likely multifactorial with contributions from
hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock.  Hypovolemic
shock likely induced by poor PO intake prior to presentation.
Distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response
to surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to
translocation of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Cardiogenic
shock possible in setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation in
patient with unknown systolic function as well as cardiomyopathy
of acute illness and sepsis. Patient was given aggressive fluid
resuscitation. He was then diuresed with intermittent boluses of
IV Lasix.  He had a brief period of hypotension after several
days of diuresis the morning of [**1-14**] that responded well to
fluid resuscitation and was felt to be secondary to
overdiuresis.  He was put on Vanc/Zosyn to cover bowel flora
which was transitioned to Zosyn alone. Patient was weaned off of
pressors completely on [**1-11**].  He completed a 14 day course of
zosyn on [**2123-1-21**].

# Respiratory failure: Patient was considered for extubation on
multiple occasions, but failed breathing trials often due to
mucous plugging.  He had a new leukocytosis that began to rise
on [**1-14**] and was treated empirically for VAP with vancomycin and
ciprofloxacin from [**1-16**] to ---.  Thereafter, his white count
trended down, as did his fever curve.  He was extensively
suctioned with bronchoscopy and was finally extubated on the
morning of [**1-19**].  He did very well off the vent, with normal
work of breathing.  Mr. [**Known lastname 104087**] was maintained on a face mask and
his oxygen requirements titrated down as tolerated.  He was
continued on albuterol, atrovent and mucomyst nebulizers.

# Small bowel obstruction: Patient presented with feculent
vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely developed in setting of
prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and colostomy in past.
 He underwent small bowel obtruction and resection with
placement of an ileostomy.  He was started on trophic tube feeds
shortly after his surgery.  Additionally, immodium as started
because of high volume output from his ostomy with good effect.
Surgery followed Mr. [**Known lastname 104087**] in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] throughout his entire
course.

# VAP:  Patient with thick secretions and mucous plugging.
Patient was empirically started on broad spectrum antibiotics
for VAP with Vancomycin and Cipro as above.

# Altered mental status: patient was taken off
