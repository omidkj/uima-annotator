Pertinent Results:
[**6-13**] Head CT : IMPRESSION: Likely right frontal mass with
surrounding vasogenic edema.  Possible left frontal mass.
Further evaluation with MRI with contrast is suggested. Stable
6-mm of midline shift.

[**6-14**] ECG:  Intervals Axes
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
83 150 82 362/402 70 -2 81

[**6-14**] Head MRI: IMPRESSION:
1. Dominant 4.2 cm right frontal mass with heterogeneous
enhancement and
superficial extension to the brain surface, where there is
overlying dural
thickening concerning for broader dissemination of tumor,
transgressing the subarachnoid space. There is a moderate degree
of associated vasogenic edema and mass effect.
2. Otherwise, innumerable smaller metastatic lesions throughout
both the
supra- and infratentorial compartments.

[**6-14**] Chest/Abd/Pelvis CT: IMPRESSION:
1. Necrotic right lower lobe pulmonary mass with multiple
bilateral pulmonary nodules.
2. Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes concerning for
metastatic disesae.
Left hilar lymph node measuring 8 mm. Otherwise, no evidence for
metastatic
disease.
3. Multiple minimally displaced right-sided healing rib
fractures without bone destruction.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
5. Emphysema.

[**6-15**] Head CT: IMPRESSION:
1. Small amount of extra- and intra-axial hemorrhage and
pneumocephalus at the right frontal resection site.
2. Persistent vasogenic edema, but interval decrease in degree
of shift.
3. Known left frontal mass with associated edema, and additional
innumerable metastases (identified by recent MRI) not
appreciated, as there is little associated edema.

[**6-15**] Head MRI: IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly limited evaluation of the right frontal surgical
site due to the absence of pre-contrast T1-weighted images in
the axial plane. Questionable nodular contrast enhancement along
the superior medial aspect of the surgical cavity. Attention to
this area is recommended on future follow-up studies.
2. Numerous small supratentorial and infratentorial metastases
with mild
associated edema, as seen on [**2126-6-14**].

[**6-18**] Head CT: IMPRESSION:
Expected evolution of postsurgical changes in the right frontal
lobe. Stable mass effect. No evidence of new abnormalities.

[**6-18**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Known large right lower lobe mass. No
evidence of aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 80 year old female with PMH of metastatic small cell
lung cancer who presented for evaluation of left sided weakness
and confusion and was found to have a right frontal lobe brain
mass for which a craniotomy and resection was performed by
neurosurgery on [**2126-6-14**].  Her post-operative course was
complicated by respiratory failure requiring transfer to the
MICU from the neurosurgical service for initiation of biPAP,
steroids, and an empiric course of antibiotics which resolved
her respiratory distress.
.
#. Constipation. The patient did not have a bowel movement for
about a week despite senna, colace, bisacodyl, Miralax,
lactulose, and a one time magnesium citrate dose.  An enema was
attempted for her comfort, but was unable to be passed rectally.
 Therefore, she was manually disimpacted prior to discharge to
hospice.  She should be continued on a maximal bowel regimen for
her comfort.  She was never nauseous and had no signs of
obstruction.
.
#. Brain metastasis s/p surgery: The patient was found to have a
right frontal lobe brain mass likely from metastasis of her
known small cell lung cancer.  She had left sided weakness on
exam, but did not have a seizure.  She was started on Keppra and
Decadron and taken to the OR by neurosurgery for a craniotomy
and right frontal lobe mass resection without complication.
Post-operatively she was alert and oriented x3 with left facial
droop/pronator drift and 4/5 weakness of the left upper
extremity.  A post-operative head CT was obtained within 4 hours
as well as an MRI for post operative evaluation.  Both revealed
normal post operative changes and no significant hemmorrhage.
On [**6-18**], she began acting confused and was found to be difficult
to examine.  She was neglecting her left side and a head CT was
obtained. This revealed no significant changes from the previous
post operative scan. A CXR was also obtained for increasing
respiratory distress which was negative for aspiration. The
neurology team was consulted for help evaluating the increasing
confusion/unresponsiveness and they recommended an EEG.  This
was done and revealed that she was encephalopathic but had no
seizure activity.  She became unresponsive for several days in
the ICU, but her mental status improved spontaneously with
treatment of her respiratory failure detailed below.  She was
continued on steroid taper per recommendations of neurosrugery
and discharged on dexamethasone 2mg PO BID to continue
indefinitely.  She was also continued on Keppra for seizure
prophylaxis.  Her craniotomy sutures are dissolvable and will
not need to be removed, but a follow-up appointment has been
made with neurosurgery for her convenience if she would like to
follow-up for any questions.
.
#. Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  The patient began desatting
to the mid 80's overnight on [**6-18**] which was rectified temporarily
with 3L NC, deep nasal suctioning, and albuterol nebulizers. On
[**6-19**], the patient was noted to continue with respiratory
distress. An ABG was obtained which resulted in a PCO2 of 52,
otherwise non-signif
