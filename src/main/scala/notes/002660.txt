Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**Location (un) **] tracheal canula change and debridement of granulation
tissue

History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
tracheobronchomalacia and severe central OSA s/p trach placed in
[**5-26**] with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] button in [**11-27**], obesity hypoventilation
syndrome s/p, asthma, c-spine injury with left diaphragmatic
paralysis, pulmonary HTN, diastolic CHF, followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], who is transferred from the PACU s/p trach revision
with post-operative hypoxia with oxygen saturations to the
60-70% range.
.
Patient underwent flexible bronchoscopy on [**2197-10-27**] demonstrating
supraglottic tissues which were collapsing over the epiglottis
creating obstruction with mild degree of granulation tissue
around the [**Location (un) **] tube.  This afternoon, he underwent
[**Location (un) **] tracheal canula change and debridement of granulation
tissue.  In the PACU, his oxygen saturations were in the 60-70%
range on room air.    Patient was awake, alert, and without
acute complaints.  Patient was transferred to the MICU for
monitoring of oxygenation status overnight.
.
Upon transfer to the MICU, patient appears comfortable and is
breathing comfortably with oxygen saturations of 87% on RA.  He
has no acute complaints at this time.

EKG: [**2198-2-6**]: Sinus rhythm. A-V conduction delay. Non-specific
lateral ST-T wave changes as recorded [**2197-7-7**]. Otherwise, no
diagnostic interim change.
.
Imaging:
Chest radiograph ([**2197-2-6**]): FINDINGS: The lung volumes are
relatively low. There is unchanged marked cardiomegaly with
large diameter pulmonary vessels, suggesting mild-to-moderate
overhydration. No pleural effusions. No focal parenchymal
opacity suggesting pneumonia. Normal appearance of the
mediastinal and hilar contours.


Brief Hospital Course:
In regards to vent settings: [**Location (un) 7188**] with bag attachement,
current setting (1 liter oxygen) and an oxygen flow rate up to 6
liters/minute. We didn't test higher flow rates. [**Location (un) 7188**] with
vent settings PS 5, PEEP 5, and the minimal FiO2 needed to get
sats 90-94%. We can't set a BUR as we would on BiPAP ST, but if
the low MV alarm sounds, the ventilator will switch to SIMV
mode.
.
To Do: Needs teaching about trach care and vent management prior
to safe return to home.
.
Hospital Course:
#. Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial as patient with known
tracheobronchomalacia and severe OSA, asthma, pulmonary
hypertension, and diastolic CHF.  Lack of fever, leukocytosis,
symptoms, or chest radiographic evidence of opacities argues
against PNA.  With evidence of mild volume overload on chest
radiograph was given some lasix in attempt to diuresis with mild
improvement in hypoxia and increase in bicarb. IP recommended a
sleep study to assess for central sleep apnea after a witnessed
episode of apnea while in the ICU.

He had a tracheostomy tube placed on the monring of [**2-10**].  He
required mechanical ventilation for a short time afterwards
while the sedating medications wore off.  He underwent the sleep
study the night of [**2-10**] which was inconclusive.  Vent settings
were titrated with multiple sleep studies and he ultimately did
well on trach colalr during the day and PSV 5/5 FiO2 30% on
[**Location (un) 7188**] ventilator at nighttime. He should continue on these
vent settings while sleeping and will need teaching about how to
suction, deflate and inflate cuff and use ventilator. Goal PCO2
at nighttime remained around 60.

#. Asthma: Continued albuterol nebs.
.
#. Diastolic CHF: On last echo in [**2194**], patient found to have
severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  With evidence of
volume overload on chest radiograph was diuresed until
bicarbonate increased and then discontinued diuresis.

#. HTN: Stable, continued home hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol,
nifedipine, and lisinopril.

#. DM: Stable, held home oral antiglycemic medications and
covered with insulin sliding scale overnight. Restarted home
regimen on discharge.

#. Hyperlipidemia: Continued lovastatin 20mg PO daily.

#. PUD: Stable, on PPi.
