Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 38277**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope, hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right central venous line placement for dialysis


History of Present Illness:
60F with a h/o IDDM, CAD s/p CABG [**2172**] (LIMA -> LAD, SVG to
[**Year (4 digits) 11641**]), s/p STEMI ([**2174**]) w/ occlusion of vein graft, s/p stents
to LAD and [**Year (4 digits) 11641**] ([**2174**]), sCHF (EF ~35% 2/12), s/p AICD, PVD s/p
R toe amputations and L BKA p/w syncope. Rehab uses a [**Doctor Last Name **] lift
to move her and she feels like she can't breathe every time they
use it. While she was being moved in [**Doctor Last Name **] today, she passed
out, was given O2 and felt better but was sent in to ED.
.
Labs were wnl, AICD not interrogated as no shock delivered. CXR
showed anasarca and fluid. Pt was recently hospitalized for an
episode of unresponsiveness, work up essentially negative at
that time, thought to be possibly due to sedating medications
and discharged with increased dose of torsemide for her CHF.
However, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] note from [**2-20**], pt has not responded to
40 mg of torsemide, so increased to 40 AM/20 PM torsemide and
did receive 1 dose of metolazone on [**2-16**]. Wt on [**2-20**] was 273#,
pt states her [**Month/Year (2) 5348**] wt is 230# back in late [**Month (only) 1096**].
Lisinopril was started and then stopped due to increase in
creatinine. [**Hospital1 **] called hospitalist here as they feel that
the patient requires higher level of care and IV diuresis and
the initial plan had been for admission to floor and discharged
to advanced care.
.
While in [**Name (NI) **], pt refused treatment and became more hypoxic. Her
initial vitals in ED showed her satting 96 on 4L NC but
eventually came down to 88% on 4L and pt refused to take IV
diuretics till coming upstairs. Floor refusing to take her bc of
hypoxia. Pt also refusing foley but did finally receive IV
torsemide in ED. Transfer vitals were: 72 130/77 16 95% on 7L
venti mask.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient appears comfortable, satting high
90s on 4L NC. Pt states that her shortness of breath is stable,
endorses orthopnea and interval improvement in her swelling,
denies chest pain, PND, cough, fever/chills or abdominal pain.
.

Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. There are filamentous strands
on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences
(normal variant). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
moderate global systolic dysfunction. Mild functional mitral
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
