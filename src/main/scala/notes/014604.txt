History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 67 year old Spanish-speaking female with h/o ESRD
on HD, CAD, h/o HIT, DM, s/p L BKA, and prior line infections
who is being transfered for possible vertebral osteomyelitis.

She was originally admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital from [**Date range (1) 81661**]
for abdominal pain and mental status changes.  She had an
abdominal CT negative for intraabdominal pathology but it showed
vertebral osteomyelitis.  Follow-up MRI showed T9-T10
osteomyelitis without evidence of cord compression on [**12-18**].
On comparison with prior images from [**11-12**], per report, it
appears that vertebral changes were present but not recognized
at the time.  Blood cultures grew enterococcus faecalis and she
was treated with vancomycin on dialysis days for a 14 day course
to end [**1-3**].  She had her HD catheter pulled [**12-23**].
Surveillance cultures have shown NGTD.  She had a negative PPD
and 3 negative AFB smears.  She had an attempted bone biopsy by
IR but no bone was recovered.  She was transferred "for further
evaluation of the osteomyelitis for possible fungal or
tuberculoid etiologies, if no improvement with the vancomycin."
Bone biopsy was done on [**12-27**] with inefficient yield for
diagnosis.  She was readmitted on [**1-1**] for recurrent abdominal
pain.

She is dialyzed T, Th, Sat and had a partial session on [**1-3**].
She has a left arm fistula that was used at the OSH for dialysis
but then clotted.  A second abdominal catheter was placed on
[**12-25**] for further access but per the dc summary, "it is felt
that this fistula should be left for further maturation."  Per
signout, "current HD access via right subclavian line, has
immature AVF in LUE."

On floor, she continues to complain of severe RUQ pain, worse
with movement and worse in the supine position.  She states it
radiates around her back on both sides when it gets severe.  She
states she's had it for two weeks, although the dc summary from
the OSH states several months.  Also complains of pain radiating
down her right leg of [**2-6**] weeks.  On further questioning, she
also endorsed lower extremity weakness for 4 days-1 week.

Denies fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea,
or vomiting.  Had not had a bowel movement for several days at
OSH, previously had  diarrhea.  Does not urinate.

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use, quit smoking in [**2194**]. There is no history of alcohol abuse.
Lives at home with her husband, daughter, son and [**Name2 (NI) 802**]. She is
originally form [**Male First Name (un) 1056**]. She does not speak English.

There is no family history of sudden death. Mother died of an MI

at 56 YO. Dad had a cardiovascular disease and died at [**Age over 90 **] YO of
"old age". One sister with HTN, one sister and one brother
healthy. [**Name2 (NI) **] history of cancer in the family.

interacts.

EXTREMITIES - Edematous bilaterally, [**1-5**]+.  1+ pedal pulses in
right foot, has left BKA.

mouths words (trach in place).  Clearly alert and responsive,
but does not repsond to commands, will occasionally respond to
questions.  Spanish-speaking only.
SKIN - multiple wounds, post-surgical and pressure wounds, as
detailed below.

Trach: continues to have increase drainage peritube

G-tube: left ABD with moderate thick drainage from site, no
peritubular skin breakdown

Right axilla:  2 open sites, 1 x 1 cm yellow/red 50% each, wound
bed, 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm pink wound bed, wound edges are irregular,
no drainage, no s/s of infection,  other noted healed sites in
this area, undetermined etiology of wounds-possible friction

Right ABD: 2 ulcers now closed

Right lateral thigh:  2 unstageable pressure ulcers
1 x 3 cm yellow/black wound bed beginning to slough
7.5 x 1.5 cm necrotic black firm tissue beginning to slough at
proximal end and separate from wound edges.  There is a moderate
amount of yellow serous drainage.  There is no periwound
erythema, edema, induration or fluctuance.

Right lower leg just above ankle: intact darkly pigmented tissue
circumferentially in two linear configurations, ? etiology
no acute for s/s of infection

Left lateral chest tube site: closed

Left forearm/wrist: 0.5 x 1 cm dry yellow eschared site

Midline back vertebral incision: intact with steristrips in
place

Left thoracotomy incision: not approximated, 1 x 15 cm with
necrotic yellow black tissue in the wound bed, small amount of
yellow drainage with no odor, wound edges defined, no
surrounding
erythema, edema, or fluctuance

Inferior to left thoracotomy incision: 4 x 4.5 cm partial
thickness ulcer with 100% red wound bed improved maybe related
to
tape injury, wound edges are irregular, no s/s of infection

Left lateral back: 2.5 x 1 cm unstageable pressure ulcer with
50%
yellow/50% pink wound bed, irregular wound edges, no surrounding
s/s of infection

Left trochanter:  3 x 3.5 cm unstageable pressure ulcer, 100%
yellow fibrinous tissue, irregular wound edges, scant drainage
with no odor, periwound tissue intact with no induration, edema,
or fluctuance

Intergluteal tissue:  unchanged parital thickness ulcer with
100%
red wound bed and irregular wound edges most likely related to
moisture, appears to be healing

Perianal: anterior anus 1.5 x 0.2 cm, Stage II pressure ulcer
most likely from pressure of the FMS tubing.
