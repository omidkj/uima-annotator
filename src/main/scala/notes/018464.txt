Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfered for ERCP for elevated Bilirubin and concern for
cholangitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
77 yo M with h/o HTN, PAF p/w N/V/abdominal pain and poor PO
intake to an OSH, who was found to have elevated LFTs and
transferred here for ERCP.  He initially developed N/V (no
hematemesis) about 1 week ago with associated abdominal pain
from the wretching, and thought that this was secondary to
gastroenteritis.  The next few days he had poor PO intake.  He
went to see his [**Name8 (MD) 6435**] NP and was treated with belladonna and a
medication that he can't remember with some improvement.
However, his symptoms returned and he felt progressively weaker,
culminating in a fall at home from his bed with head injury, but
no LOC.  After the fall, he was unable to get help for 5 hours
before contacting his daughter and being brought into the
hospital.  He presented to the ED at [**Location (un) **] on [**5-11**] where he
was found to be hypotensive with elevated LFTs and CK and a temp
to 101.  He was also found to have ARF with a Cr 2.4 which
improved to 1.6 with hydration, and a leukocytosis of 13.4.  He
was noted to have some small lacerations on his face in the ER,
which were stitched up, and had a head CT which was negative for
acute intracranial abnormality.  His admission cardiac enzymes
were CK 9000, MB 51 and troponin 0.1 (negative).  The troponin
remained flat, and his other enzymes normalized with hydration
to CK 3700, MB 13.  His LFTs on admission included an AST 175
(peak 231), ALT 85, Bili 12.8 (peak 14.8).  Lipase and amylase
were 181 and 186, respectively, about 1.3 times normal.  An
ammonia level was normal.  An abdominal ultrasound showed a
normal sized GB, intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation, a dilated CBD measuring 1.0 cm, + sludge, a limited
evaluation of the pancreas and no visualized stones.  A CXR
showed a large hiatal hernia witha associated LLL atelectasis.
A chest CT was ordered for further evaluation and showed a large
hiatal hernia extending to both hemithoraces with associated
adjacent atelectasis, without infiltrate or pleural effusion
seen.  While in the ED, he developed an episode of SVT with
associated SOB and wheezing and that resolved on its own.  The
patient was admitted to the MICU for monitoring and hydration.
In the MICU, he was started on levophed which was titrated off
early in the AM, unasyn 3 g Q6.  His CVP was 17-18.  He became
wheezy later that AM with a desaturation to 70% and his O2 was
increased from 2LNC to a 100% FM.  He was found to be in AF with
RVR with rate 150, and a CXR showing pulmonary edema.  He was
given lopressor, SL NTG, 40 mg IV lasix.  His BP became
unsteady, and he was given an IV bolus with no effect and
started on a neosynephrine drip.  An ABG was
7.23/36/156/14.7/98.7, and his IVF were changed to D5 with 3
Amps HCO3 at 150 cc/hr.  A repeat ABG was 7.38/30.4/256/17.7.
The patient's antibiotics were also switched to gentamicin,
unasyn Q6 and levaquin just prior to transfer.  GI was consulted
during his evaluation, and recommended an MRCP.  As an MRCP was
not possible given the patient's multiple pumps, the decision
was made to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of
ERCP and for tertiary care.  Just prior to transfer, the patient
had another episode of flash pulmonary edema, and was given a
total of 15 mg lopressor without benefit, 10 mg diltiazem with
control of his rate, placed on a diltiazem drip, SL NTG x1 and 1
mg of morphine.
.
ROS: He reports low grade fevers at home to 99-100, no further
nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain, no diarrhea (though stools
are slightly loose), last BM yesterday, no black or bloody
stools, no chest pain, sob, dysuria.

EKG at OSH: AF with RVR and new RBBB (by report)
.
[**2154-5-11**] head CT - no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift
of normally seen midline structures or hydrocephalus.
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation is well maintained.  osseous
and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.  visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
.
[**2154-5-11**] Chest CT - There is a large hiatal hernia extending to
both hemithoraces with associated adjacent atelectasis.  No
infiltrate or pleural effusion is seen.  The remaining
mediastinal structures are unremarkable.  The visualized portion
of the abdominal organs are unremarkable.
.
[**2154-5-11**] Portable Chest - comparison was made to prior study
dated [**2152-3-28**].  There is a large hiatal hernia with associated
adjacent atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or infiltrate seen.
.
[**2154-5-11**] Abdominal ultrasound - Gallbladder is not significantly
distended.  No significant gallbladder wall thickening.  There
is intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  The
CBD measures 1.0 cm which is abnormally dilated for the
patient's age.  There is normal appearance of the liver and
bilateral kidneys.  The right kidney measures 10.9 cm and the L
kidney length measures 12.0 cm.  The spleen measures 9.9 cm.
Limited evaluation of the pancreas, abdominal aorta and IVC.
Large amount of biliary sludge is identified within the
gallbladder but gallstones are not identified.

EKG here: NSR at 92 (seems to be sinus rhythm - p waves seen in
V1, but difficult to see elsewhere, regular rate), nl axis, 1st
degree AV block, RBBB, TW in III, V1

ERCP: single CBD stone removed with drainage of frank pus.
