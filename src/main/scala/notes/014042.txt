HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit initially because of hypotension and
signs and symptoms consistent with severely impaired renal
function.  Her blood pressures were between 80 and 90
systolic with a heartrate in the 120s and she was started on
intravenous fluids.  Blood cultures were sent and she was
started on Levofloxacin.  She had a PICC line in place which
was felt to be a potential source of infection, line sepsis
and so therefore this line was pulled and she received
Vancomycin.  She was started on a Dopamine drip titrated to 6
to 8 mcg/kg/min and she remained pressor dependent with
lowgrade temperatures for several days.  She was started on
gentamicin to have double coverage.  Eventually she was
weaned from her pressors and in total she is 3 liters
positive since her admission.  Repeat chest x-ray revealed a
patchy left lower lobe infiltrate with fusion.  The patient
continued to spike lowgrade temperatures and Flagyl was added
for further coverage.  Therefore at one point the patient was
on Vancomycin, Gentamicin and Flagyl and Levofloxacin.  Blood
cultures returned 4 out 4 bottles positive for gram negative
rods, later identified to be Serratia Marcescens.
Furthermore her catheter tip came back negative for
organisms.  Given the information the Vancomycin was
discontinued as well as gentamicin and Flagyl as the
patient's Serratia was pansensitive and Levofloxacin was
used.  She remained afebrile for the remainder of her
hospital stay.  Given the source of Serratia she has the
final diagnosis of Serratia sepsis.

On the day prior to discharge repeat urinalysis revealed 200
white blood cells, no bacteria and many yeasts.  Therefore
she was started on a course of Fluconazole.

At the time of this dictation the patient was doing well,
tolerating p.o.s and tube feeds.  She could ambulate to the
chair with assistance and felt strong enough to return to her
nursing home.  From a medical perspective the patient is
stable for transfer to [**Hospital3 24509**] Home.
