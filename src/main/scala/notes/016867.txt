Admission Date:  [**2102-10-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2102-10-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**2032-1-29**]       Sex:  F

Service:  NEUROLOGY/MEDICINE
NOTE:  The following is an admission history and physical as
noted by the Coronary Care Unit house staff.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left sided weakness.

a history of emphysema, tobacco abuse, restless leg syndrome
and left Horner's syndrome who presents to an outside
hospital complaining of left sided weakness.  Her recent
history began when she was at her kitchen table when she
began to feel a heaviness in her left leg, which spread to
her left arm.  EMS was called and Mrs. [**Known lastname 45270**] was brought to
the [**Hospital6 33**] where an acute ischemic stroke was
given intravenous tissue plasminogen activator without
complications.  About four hours after this she developed
intermittent chest pain, which was substernal, nonradiating.
She was given sublingual nitroglycerin and a beta blocker
with improvement in her symptoms.  An ECG at that time
revealed some ST segment elevation in leads V3 through V4.
She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for emergent cardiac catheterization as her
cardiac enzymes were trending up with a CK of 264, MB of 90
and troponin less then 0.1.  She received heparin in route to
[**Hospital1 69**].

Cardiac catheterization revealed no significant coronary
artery disease, however, she did have poor myocardial
perfusion with TIMI 0 flow in the left anterior descending
coronary artery and TIMI 1 flow in the right coronary artery
thought to be vasospastic, which improved with Diltiazem.
Estimated ejection fraction at that time was 30%.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 45270**] was subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit for closer cardiac monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Emphysema and asthma.  2.
Restless leg syndrome.  3.  Horner's syndrome on the left.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa drugs causes pruritus.

MEDICATIONS:  1.  Albuterol MDI prn.  2.  Quinine sulfate.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 45270**] lives alone.  She works full
time as a waitress and has had more then 100 pack year
history of tobacco use, though she quit some three years ago.
Some ethanol use continues with two to three drinks each
night.  She cares for her 8 year-old granddaughter.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother suffered a stroke in her 60s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature 97.5.  Blood
pressure 132/81.  Heart rate 98.  Respirations 18.  96% SPO2
on room air.  General, comfortable lying in bed.  Head and
neck, pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.
Oropharynx is moist with no exudate and no erythema.  The
neck is with no JVD, bruits or lymphadenopathy.  Lungs clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular regular rhythm,
normal rate.  Abdomen positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Groin, right arterial sheath in place without
oozing.  Extremities positive pulses.  No clubbing or edema.
Neurological alert and oriented to person, place and time.
Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  Mild weakness in
the left orbicularis oculi.  Strength is 5 out of 5 in the
right upper and lower extremities.  1 out of 5 strength on
the left lower and upper extremities.  Reflexes are 2+ on the
right and brisk 3+ on the left brachial and patellar.  There
is a Babinski on the left.  Hot cold sensation intact.
Proprioception intact.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 5.4, hematocrit 33,
platelets 215, sodium 141, potassium 4.3, chloride 108,
bicarb 23, BUN 14, creatinine 0.5, glucose 107.  CK series
176, 200, 228, 264, MB of 15, 16 and 9, troponin of 7.6, 0.3
and less then 0.1.  ECG normal sinus rhythm, rate 90, ST
segment elevations in V3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 45270**] was subsequently admitted to
the Coronary Care Unit for further management of her acute
myocardial infarction in the setting of an acute cerebral
infarction.  She was started on a Diltiazem drip for
vasospasm.  Subsequently heparin and Warfarin were added.
She was also started on an aspirin.  As her blood pressure
stabilized the Diltiazem drip was weaned off and the patient
started on a beta blocker.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 45270**] continued to do clinically well in the Coronary
Care Unit and therefore transferred to the Neurology Service
subsequently.  The course on the Neurologic Medicine Service
is as noted by [**Initials (NamePattern5) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) **].  Mrs. [**Known lastname 45270**] was observed on the
Neurology Service and the heparin and Warfarin were
continued.  She received physical therapy and over the last
several days of her hospital course her left sided
hemiparesis has improved dramatically.  Initially on transfer
to neurology she had a pronounced upper motor neuron pattern
weakness in the left upper and lower extremities.  Over the
next several hospitalization days her strength improved and
at the time of this dictation she has 4+ strength in all
extremities on the left side.  She is able to walk with
assistance of physical therapy from twenty feet this morning
and is very encouraged by her progress.

With regard to her acute myocardial and cerebral infarctions
the current thinking is that she indeed has suffered an right
anterior choroidal artery distribution cerebral infarction, which
has left her with the left paresis.  In this setting she may
have also suffered a myocardial infarction due to vasospasm from
a sympathetic surge.  A subsequent echocardiogram revealed an
ejection fraction of 25% with significant left ventricular
wall motion abnormalities particularly anterior and septal
akinesis.  There is also hypokinesis at the lateral wall and
akinesis of the distal third of the inferior wall.
Furthermore subsequent MR imaging revealed a second area of
cerebral infarction in the left parietal occipital region
most consistent with a watershed infarct.  However, given two
separate distribution strokes in the setting of a severely
depressed ejection fraction and akinetic and hyperkinetic
myocardium it is reasonable to treat prophylactically with
Warfarin.  Carotid dopplers done in house were also
unremarkable without significant disease.  MR angiogram of
the head shows some 40% stenosis in the distal basal artery
with a possible small 4 mm aneurysm at the basilar tip.

Regarding cardiac issues, Mrs. [**Known lastname 45270**] is continued on a beta
blocker and we anticipate the addition of an ace inhibitor in
the near future as her blood pressure tolerates would be
helpful in aiding cardiac remodeling.  Given her clean
coronaries we have discussed with cardiology with regard for
the need for aspirin and we are in agreement that aspirin at
this point is not needed.

At the time of this dictation Mrs. [**Known lastname 45270**] is clinically
stable and in fact from a neurological perspective is
improving and tolerating physical therapy quite well.  She is
therefore stable for transfer to a rehabilitation hospital.
Her INR yesterday was 1.9 and this morning level is pending.
We anticipate that it will be in the therapeutic range of 2
to 3 and she will be discontinued from her heparin before
transfer.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to [**Hospital3 **].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Right anterior choroidal artery infarction with left
hemiparesis.
2.  Left parietal occipital ischemic stroke.
3.  Myocardial infarction with clean coronaries and an
ejection fraction of 25 and severe wall motion abnormalities.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  1.  Warfarin 2.5 mg po q day.
Please check INR in one to two days and adjust accordingly.
2.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg po b.i.d.  3.  Pantoprazole 40 mg po q
day.  4.  Lipitor 10 mg po q day.  This was started as her
lipid profile revealed an elevated LDL above 100.  5.
Cyclobenzaprine 10 mg b.i.d. prn muscle spasm.  6.  Combivent
one to two puffs q six hours.  7.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
