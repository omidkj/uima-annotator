Blood Culture [**2136-11-27**]", Routine (Preliminary): STAPHYLOCOCCUS,
COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST.. Isolated from only one set
in the previous five days.

IMAGING:
[**2136-11-26**]
CXR IMPRESSION:
1.  Patient is rotated to the right.  Moderate-to-marked
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
2.  Central pulmonary vascular engorgement.
3.  Areas of linear patchy bibasilar opacity most likely
represent
atelectasIS

[**2136-11-26**]- CT HEAD-IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.
Chronic involutional changes.

[**2136-11-30**]
Right Upper quandrant ultrasound
1.  Sludge in the gallbladder with no evidence of gallbladder
wall edema to
suggest cholecystitis. No biliary dilation.
2.  Complex cystic lesion within the lower pole of the right
kidney measuring
2.3 x 2.3 x 2.7 cm. Recommend MRI for further evaluation as
malignancy cannot
be excluded.
3.  Additional bilateral simple renal cysts.
4.  Bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
79F w/ PMH of dementia, sCHF w/ LV thrombus, ESRD on HD who
presents with AMS, and elevated lactate

#Coagulase negative staph Bacteremia:The patient was growing
coagulase negative staph in [**1-30**] bottles. It was likley a
contaminant. She was empircally treated with vancomycin, which
was subsequently discontinued once the gram positive cocci were
speciated as coagulase negative staph.

# AMS/dementia: Patient has known dementia with recent worsening
of baseline. Patient was recently discharged on [**2136-11-13**] for
worsened dementia with increased hallucinations. Her acute
worsening of AMS likely related to hyoglycemic epidsode at home.
It is unclear why she was hypoglyemic. It is possible that she
has imparied gluconeogenesis from her congestive hepatopathy and
renal failure. Unclear if patient had an underlying infection,
leading to hypoglycemia. Her CXR was negative, blood cultures
were growing a contaminant. Her UA is difficult to interpret in
the setting of oliguira and urine Cx grew mixed bacterial flora.
She received a few doses of cefepime and levaquin for ?
urosepsis, although unclear if the patient has a true urinary
tract infection, and if an infection was the cause of her
hypglycemia. Given her improvement in mental status, after
receiving antibiotics, the patient will be discharged on
ciprofloxacin for treatment of complicated UTI.

# Complicated UTI-  ( see above) will treat with ciprofloxacin.
last day of antibiotics [**2136-12-5**]

# right kindey mass- On right upper quadrant ultrasound the
patient was  found to have a complex cystic lesion within the
lower pole of the right kidney measuring.2.3 x 2.3 x 2.7 cm.
Radiology recommend MRI for further evaluation as malignancy
cannot be excluded.

# Congestive hepatopathy- The patient has a history of
transaminitis with increased AST/ ALT, Alk [**Doctor Last Name **] and normal nl
bili noted inially in [**2136-9-29**].  LFTs reached almost 3x
baseline during this admission.  Her LFTs are consistent with
hepatocellular injury. Her work up for transaminities included
hepatitis serologies on a previous admission which were
negative. A RUQ ultrasound showed no evidence of CBD diliation
or cholecystitis. It likley that her
