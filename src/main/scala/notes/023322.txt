IMAGING:
CT A/P:
1. Bibasilar lung consolidations (atelectasis versus pneumonia)
with small
pleural effusions.
2. Mild wall thickening in the rectum and distal sigmoid colon
could be
compatible with proctocolitis in the appropriate clinical
setting.
3. Sacral decubitus ulcer with evidence of periosteal reaction
in the
underlying sacrum. Clinical inspection recommended to grade and
if needed MRI may be performed to further assess.
4. Fatty atrophy of the pancreas, with multiple exophytic cystic
lesions.
MRCP is recommended to further assess.
5. Atrophic kidneys.
6. Distal fluid containing small bowel with air- fluid levels.
Findings may reflect gastroenteritis.
7. Atherosclerotic disease as described.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3075**] was a 86 yo M with PMH of Parkinson's, c. difficile,
chronic renal insufficeny, stage 4 decub ulcer who presents from
his nursing home with fevers, increased sputum production, and
proteus bacteremia and UTI requiring pressor support.  The
patient was DNR/DNI on admission.  On admission he underwent a
CT of his abdomen given abdominal pain and leukocytosis which
showed proctocolitis and with his history of C.diff he was
empirically treated with flagyl for his.  For the proteus
bacteremia and UTI he was treated with zosyn.  His hypotension
was treated with dopamine as he did not want a central line
placed and could not receive other pressors.

The night before death he was desating due to copious secretions
and becoming more dependent on pressors.  His CXR in the morning
showed many new areas of infiltrate likely consistent with
multiple aspiration events.

A family discussion was held to address goals of care given his
worsening clinical status and DNR/DNI wishes.  A priest spent
time with the family and patient and a family meeting was held
and the decision by both the patient and his daughter (his
health care proxy) was to make him [**Name (NI) 3225**] so the pressors were
weaned and he was treated with morphine prn for comfort.

During the evening he developed asytole on the telemetry
monitor.  On exam he was nonresponsive to voice or touch, his
pupils were nonreactive, he had no spontaneous breathing or
breath sounds present, and had no heart sounds present.  He was
pronounced dead at 8:46 pm.  His causes of death were listed as
cardiac arrest, sepsis, and Parkinson's Disease.  His daughters
and their husbands were in the room with him when he died and
were informed of his death (Daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 18482**] (HCP)
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 18483**]).  They declined an autopsy.  The attending
overnight, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18484**], was notified by phone.
