Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
resp distress, somnolence

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubated [**3-22**], extubated [**3-28**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 44 y/o female with CAD s/p multiple stents, s/p CABG
at age 34, who was recently at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 13514**] for
hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and ARF thought
to be [**3-13**] rhabdo and hypovolemia, who now p/w hypoxia, lethargy,
and acute renal failure. Per report, she was found by her sister
to be unresponsive today at home, and per son who saw her this
morning, thought she was just "sleeping" but difficult to
arouse. Her sister last talked to the patient yesterday evening
around 6pm. Per history, pt was c/o of worsening back pain. It
is unknown how long patient was down. [**Name (NI) 1094**] sister called EMS and
pt was brought into the ED. Pt was noted by EMS to be cyanotic
and no O2 sats were obtainable.
.
In the ED, VS were Tc 98.8, BP 138/77, HR 100, RR 28, SaO2
100%/NRB, AO x 1. Labs were significant for an ABG 7.01/77/113
on a NRB, K of 8.0 initially, Cr of 6.0. Phos was also markedly
elevated at 16.7. She was given a dose of narcan and awoke
marginally, but was still somnolent. For hyperkalemia, she was
given 1 amp calcium gluconate, insulin 10 units IV, 1 amp of
D50, 60 mg of kayexalate, and 1 amp of bicarb. She was afebrile,
but given an elevated WBC of 19, was pan-cultured and given one
dose of Levofloxacin. During her course, her SBP's dropped to
the 60's-70's systolic and she was given a total of 5 L NS with
response of SBPs to 110's. She was also started on a bicarb gtt
given the metabolic acidosis. She was tried on BiPAP initially
for a hypercapnia, however patient did not tolerate and was
subsequently intubated. Post-intubation, she was hypotensive to
70's and was started on dopamine transiently, now weaned off.
She is currently receiving her 6th L of NS, with 7th L hanging.
Continues on bicarb gtt. Serum tox was negative, urine tox not
obtainable at that time as pt was anuric in ED.
.
From the ED, she was transferred to the MICU for respiratory
failure and ARF. Pt is currently sedated and intubated.

.
CXR [**3-22**]: Right subclavian vascular catheter has been placed,
with the tip terminating within the lower superior vena cava. No
pneumothorax is evident on this semi-upright radiograph. The
lung volumes are lower on the current study compared to the
previous exam. New area of air space opacity has developed in
the right lower lung region, and may be due to an area of
asymmetrical edema or acute aspiration superimposed upon
underlying edema. Small right pleural effusion is also noted.
Examination is otherwise without change from the recent study of
earlier the same date.
.
CXR [**3-22**]: Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates
an endotracheal tube with its tip at the level of the clavicular
heads. There is a nasogastric tube present with its tip in the
stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are similar to that seen on
radiographs obtained earlier the same day. The patient is status
post CABG. There may be a small left-sided pleural effusion.
Surgical staples project over the epigastrium, left upper
quadrant, and left lateral chest wall. No pneumothorax. No
consolidation. IMPRESSION: Support lines in place. No
consolidation.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis/Chest [**3-22**]: 1. No evidence of dissection or aortic
aneurysms is seen. 2. Status post CABG with dehiscence of
sternum. 3. Moderate fatty stranding around the pancreas. This
is of undetermined significance and might suggest pancreatitis.
4. Compressive atelectatic changes at both lung bases.
.
CT Head [**3-22**]: The study is limited by motion artifact. There is
no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, hydrocephalus, shift of
normally midline structures, or infarction. The density values
of the brain parenchyma are within normal limits. Surrounding
osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION:
Limited study due to motion. No abnormalities detected.
.
CXR [**3-22**]: Comparison is made to [**2166-11-28**] and multiple
prior chest radiographs dating back to [**2165-4-17**]. There is
stable marked cardiomegaly. No evidence of pulmonary edema or
sizable effusions. There are no focal consolidations. There may
be mild plate-like atelectasis at the left lung base. Again seen
are CABG markers. IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly without
evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
.
Echo [**3-23**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. The
