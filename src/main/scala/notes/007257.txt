resultant severe symptomatic anemia and cardiac demand ischemia.
Her exertional dyspnea and ischemic EKG findings resolved
following PRBC transfusion.
.

bloody urine and no clots in foley. She was afebrile, WBC 6.4.
UA was positive. CXR shows R scarring, unchanged from prior. For
SOB, CTA chest was performed for PE. Has unknown history of
pulmonary mets, and has history of MAC and mycobacterium
kansasii in her sputum.

Admission CXR:
1. Increased interstitial markings and cystic changes within the
upper lobes bilaterally, corresponding to patient's known
bronchiectasis seen on prior CT scans. The linear opacity in the
right middle lobe is again seen, likely corresponds to the area
of atelectasis and/or scar. No acute superimposed pulmonary
process is identified.
2. Stable compression deformity involving T12.
3. Porcelain gallbladder.
.
CTA chest: 1. Diffuse bronchiectasis. Multiple nodular and
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities are not significantly changed compared to
the prior examination. Infectious etiology should be considered
including [**Doctor First Name **], with tuberculosis once again a consideration.  2.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.  3. Porcelain gallbladder and
gallstone. Further evaluation is recommended on an elective
basis

Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo Cantonese-speaking F with active T3 bladder cancer dx'ed
[**2170**], s/p debulking TUR with subsequent XRT w/ persistent
bleeding from her bladder tumors requiring multiple
transfusions, presents with gross hematuria and Hct of 18.
Hospital course by problem.
.
# Gross hematuria: Secondary to known bladder tumors. Also has a
known large clot in bladder found on cystoscopy.  Has continued
to make good UOP since admission.  Hct continued to trend down
slowly w/ persistent hematuria.  Given her history of cardiac
ischemia in the setting of anemia, she was transfused for a goal
of hct >30. By [**2173-3-7**], she had received 3U prbcs and on [**3-9**]
she received another 1U PRBCs.  Continuous bladder irrigation
was performed.  She remained hemodynamically stable while in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  On [**2173-3-9**] she underwent cystoscopy, clot evaluation,
TURBT, and fulguration.  She tolerated this well and had her
foley removed the following morning.  Her urine was yellow and
she did not have further episodes of hematuria.
.
# Cards vascular: positive troponin:  Patient has a h/o demand
ischemia in the setting of anemia [**3-16**].  She had a mild
elevation in her CE which was thought to be [**3-12**] demand ischemia
in the setting of low hematocrit.  No ischemic EKG changes.  She
did, however, complain of SOB and pleuritic chest pain on
admission.  Flat CKs despite troponin elevation (max troponin
0.12).  As above, she was transfused PRBCs w/ Hct goal >30 in
setting of troponin leak.  She did not have further complaints
of chest pain or shortness of breath thereafter.  We did treat
with perioperative beta blockade which she tolerated well.
.
# UTI:  Urinalysis in the ED was consistent with infection.  She
had no previous positive urine cultures in system to raise
suspicion for resistant organism.  Ciprofloxacin was started
transiently while awaiting cultures.  Urine cultures from [**3-6**]
revealed 10-100K enterococcus. Ciprofloxacin was discontinued
and ampicillin was started (despite not >100K) given elevated
WBC count on admission (no left shift).  She will complete a 7
day course shortly after discharge.
