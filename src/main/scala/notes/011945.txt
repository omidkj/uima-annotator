Blood transfusion


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 61 year-old male with a history of cerebal palsy,
mild mental retardation, atrial flutter s/p cardioversion, PEs
in [**2134**], [**2138**] on coumadin who presented with a supratherpauetic
INR. Patient states that his visiting nurse came to draw his INR
yesterday, and afterwards, he had persistent bleeding from the
site on his hand all day. By the afternoon, he was called by his
PCP's office, was told his INR was 10 and that he should hold
his coumadin. He went to bed last night and woke up with blood
on the sheets from his hand. He thus dialed 911 and was [**Last Name (un) 4662**]

been taking his coumadin dose as directed, no changes in diet,
no recent nausea/vomiting/diarrhea or decreased PO intake. He
does state that he recently started a new anti-depressant two
weeks ago, but does not recall the name.

in 1 L NS at 250cc/hr. He is being admitted for reversal of
supratherpauetic INR.

IMAGING
==============
HEAD CT [**2139-9-30**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial pathologic process. No intracranial
hemorrhage.
2. Similar marked global atrophy, with moderate chronic
microvascular
ischemic disease.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  [**2139-10-10**]
There are mild bibasilar atelectasis. There are no focal hepatic
lesions. The gallbladder is slightly distended but there is no
evidence of cholecystitis. The pancreas and spleen are normal.
Multiple bilateral nonobstructive up to 14 mm (in the right mid
pole) renal stones are seen, similar to [**2138**]. No hydronephrosis.


The adrenal glands are prominent bilaterally but no evidence of
focal lesions. There are scattered, non-pathologically enlarged
retroperitoneal lymph nodes.

There are mild atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal
aorta.

There is no free intraperitoneal fluid.

The esophagus, stomach, small and large bowel are normal.

There is a large left rectus sheath hematoma which extends into
the left
extraperitoneal pelvic space. The hematoma has a fluid-fluid
level consistent with an acute on chronic component. The rectus
sheath component measures about 14 x 7 x 12 cm, the
extraperitoneal pelvic component measures about 17 x 11 x 17 cm.


The urinary bladder is displaced posteriorly. The rectum is
normal.

Additionally, there is subcutaneous stranding at the left flank
overlying the left iliac crest, also representing a small amount
of hematoma.

There is no evidence of active extravasation within the
hematoma.
BONES: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:
Large left rectus sheath and left extraperitoneal acute on
chronic hematoma as described above.


Brief Hospital Course:
61 year-old male with a history of cerebal palsey, mild mental
retardation, atrial flutter s/p cardioversion, Pulmonary
embolisms in [**2134**], [**2138**] on coumadin admitted with bleeding from
a peripheral blood draw site with INR 19. He was treated with
vitamin K and given lovenox bridge when INR <2.0, his course was
complicated by pneumonia, and rectus sheath hematoma.

ACTIVE ISSUES
==============

#. Supertherapeutic INR: After discussion with care givers and
pharmacy, it is likely that this was an accidental overdose by
caregivers. [**Name (NI) **] was admitted with bleedi
