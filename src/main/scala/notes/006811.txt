Approved: FRI [**2164-5-11**] 1:26 PM
FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates normal echogenicity, without
evidence of a
hepatic fluid collection. No biliary dilatation is seen.

Color Doppler and pulse wave Doppler images were obtained.
Doppler
interrogation of the portal venous system is technically
limited. However,
the main portal vein appears patent with wall- to- wall color
flow, but with
reversal of flow, which is new from [**2164-2-9**].

Appropriate flow is seen within the main, right, and left
hepatic arteries
with sharp systolic upstrokes. Appropriate flow is also seen
within the IVC
and hepatic veins.

IMPRESSION:
1. Hepatic vasculature with wall-to-wall color flow. Doppler
interrogation
of the portal venous system is technically limited; however,
there appears to
be reversal of flow within the main portal vein, new from prior
study.

2. No focal hepatic abnormality or fluid collection identified.

Findings discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 71506**] at the time of
dictation.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Approved: SUN [**2164-5-13**] 8:19 AM
IMPRESSION:

1. Diffusely small hepatic vasculature, but donor hepatic
artery, portal
vein, and hepatic veins are patent.

2. Relative narrowing of the junction between the donor and
recipient IVC.

3. Nonocclusive thrombus in superior mesenteric vein and
interval development
of nonocclusive thrombus at anterior aspect of the recipient
portal vein,
which does not extend across the anastomosis.

4. Persistent esophageal and splenic varices.

5. Splenic artery pseudoaneurysms (unchanged from prior).

6. Diffuse subcutaneous edema and ascites.

7. Diffuse colonic wall edema.

8. Rectal varices.

Approved: SAT [**2164-5-12**] 10:44 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Intermittent flow in the portal vein, which was more
consistently present
towards the end of the examination, after patient received
intravenous
pressors and fluids.
2. The flow in the intrahepatic main portal vein, left portal
vein and right
portal vein is retrograde (hepatofugal) and of low velocity.
3. Some anterograde flow is demonstrated in the extrahepatic
portal vein in
the region of the portacaval shunt.
4. No flow demonstrated in the hepatic veins.

Brief Hospital Course:
PAtient's liver transplant was unevetful - with the exception
that the transplanted liver was from a 5 y/o donor and therefore
slightly mismatched volume with the patient's body habitus, but
otherwise transplant itself went well. Her immediate
postoperative course was uneventful until she developed
worsening lactic acidosis and worsening and rising bilirubin on
POD2. She underwent an ultrasound 24 hours after the initial
postop ultrasound that demonstrated normal flow. The subsequent
ultrasound demonstrated hepatofugal flow. She underwent a CT
scan with contrast that did not demonstrate any significant
systemic portal venous collaterals, but demonstrated a marked
pruning of the portal venous branches intrahepatically.
Usually this is consistent with hepatic congestion. She was
taken to the operating room for exploration. She underwent
portal vein thrombectomy and construction of portacaval
anastomosis. She initially did well for the first 6 hours postop
but then
began having a rising lactate. A portal vein ultrasound at this
time demonstrated a complete thrombosis of the portal venous
system. She was taken to the operating room for exploration
where a portal vein thrombectomy, redo portal venous
portal-portal anastomosis, takedown of choledochostomy, portal
venogram and temporary
abdominal closure was performed. She was maintained on
prophalactic antibiotics througout. After her third operation
patient remained fairly unstable gradually requiring 3 pressors,
multiple blood product transfusions, and increasing oxygen
requirements on the ventilator. She had been relisted for a
transplant but needed to removed after 48hrs due to instability.
After continued discussions with the fmaily the decision was
finally made to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**] and she expired shortly after
withdrawl on [**2164-5-15**] in the late am. Family and attending
physician were notified.
