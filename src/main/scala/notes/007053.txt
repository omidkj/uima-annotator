Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 805**] presented to the ED and was evaluated for her chest
pain and shortness of breath.  Given her presentation of
pleuritic chest pain, fever, shortness of breath, recent history
of aspiration, and negative cardiac enzymes it was felt that she
was most likely suffering from aspiration pneumonia.  She was
admitted to the SICU for continuous cardio pulmonary monitoring,
and IV antibiotics.  After several days of antibiotics she
defervesced and her white count began to drop.

Given her improvement, she was transferred out of the SICU and
to the floor where she continued to receive IV Vancomycin and
Zosyn.  She did well on the floor except for one episode of
Atrial fibrillation that occurred as a result of a missed beta
blocker dosage (held per protocol because of low systolic blood
pressure). She was evaluated at the bedside and EKG confirmed
A-fib and she was given appropriate doses of her beta blocker
and fluid.  During the entire episode, she never endorsed chest
pain, dizziness, or palpitations.  The event lead to a trigger
being called.  Because she remained mildly tachycardic, she was
transferred to a higher level of care for observation and
converted to Sinus rhythm overnight. In the morning she was
transferred back to the floor and continued to improve, working
with physical therapy and beginning to take in some regular diet
in addition to her tube feeds.

The primary team scheduled a EGD for further evaluation of her
aspiration and patency of her esophagectomy anastomosis.  The
EGD showed widely patent esophago-gastric anastomosis, large
amount of retained food in stomach and a normal appearing
pylorus that was dilated to 18mm.

Since the EGD, Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] has been afebrile, voiding,
ambulating, tolerating oral intake as well as receiving tube
feeds.
