Findings
pre-bypass exam revealed normal wall function and severely
stenotic aortic valve. No PFO was recognized.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
is seen in the LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Simple atheroma in aortic
root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Mildly dilated descending
aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Severely thickened/deformed
aortic valve leaflets. Critical AS (area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+)
AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
post-bypass:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is severe
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is
being AV paced
1. A mechanical prosthesis is well positioned in the aortic
position. Annulus is stable, leaflets open well. Washing jets
are seen. No perivalvular leaks are noted. Mean gradient is 4 mm
of Hg.
2. Bi ventricular function is preserved.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
4. Other findings are unchanged



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1124**] was admitted on [**2195-6-18**] for a cardiac catheterization,
pre-operative work-up and intra-venous heparin.  His surgery was
post-poned for an elevated INR and then his INR was allowed to
drift down without intervention. On [**2195-6-22**] he underwent an
aortic valve replacement (23mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical), coronary
artery bypass grafting times one (LIMA to LAD).  Please see the
operative note for details. His bypass time was 133 minutes with
a crossclamp x of 104 minutes He tolerated this procedure well
and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the
surgical intensive care unit.  He remained hemodynamically
stable in the immediate post-op period and  on the morning of
POD1 he was extubated.
On post-operative day two he was transferred to the stepdown
floor for continued recovery and post-op care. His tubes, lines
and drains were removed according to cardiac surgery protocol.
