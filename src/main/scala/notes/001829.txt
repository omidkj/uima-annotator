Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left sided Talc Pleurodesis
Intubation [**2142-4-3**]
Upper Endoscopy (EGD - esophagogastroduodenoscopy): [**2142-4-3**] and

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7864**] is an 87 Russian-speaking woman from the [**Location (un) 3156**]
with history of dCHF, Hypertension, Hypothyroidism,
Hyperlipidemia, with >1yr history of exudative bilateral pleural
effusions, presenting for elective admission for medical
thorascopy with talc pleurodesis of left effusion.  Bilateral
pleural effusions initially attributed to CHF, did not respond
completely to diuresis, found to be exudative and lymphocytic
after multiple thoracenteses.  Last [**Month (only) **], patient underwent
medical thoracoscopy with talc pleurodesis on right side, which
improved right sided effusion temporarily.  Cytology and culture
negative at that time, and effusion still exudative.  Patient
admitted now for elective mediastinal thorascopy on left in
setting of recurrent Left sided pleural effusions and persistent
fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Thoracentesis was attempted
[**12/2141**], but procedure was stopped after 500ml were removed in
setting of discomfort and question of trapped lung.

Patient underwent talc pleurodesis on left on day of admission,
requiring ketamine for sedation.  Received nerve block prior to
procedure.  Nonspecific inflammation, patchy erythema seen in
pleura with no overt evidence of cancer.  Fluid sent for AFB
smear and culture, fungal culture, gram stain and culture,
cytology.  Pleural biopsy done for pathology as well.  She was
given 800 cc LR in the OR and 250cc bolus in PACU.  Pleurex
catheter and chest tube in place to suction.  Vitals in PACU
post-op as follows: BP 120/80 HR 60-80s RR  SaO2 96% 6L NC.  She
took a few hours to recover from sedation and ketamine, but on
arrival to the floor, she felt well overall.  She denied any
pain in her chest/lungs.  Denied shortness of breath at rest.

Radiologic Studies:

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2142-3-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Tiny left apical pneumothorax. New left thoracostomy tubes.
2) Improved left lung aeration.
3) New right mediastinal contour may reflect a new loculated
effusion.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2142-3-27**]
IMPRESSION:
Moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive
atelectasis is
unchanged from the prior exam.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2142-3-29**]
12:12 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of a hazy left upper zone opacity, which
may signify focal atelectasis or pneumonia.
2. No pneumothorax.
3. Worsening left lower lobe collapse.
4. Unchanged moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent
atelectasis.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2142-3-30**]
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: A left-sided chest tube terminates
in the left upper lung as before. Severe left basilar
atelectasis is similar to prior.
Moderate left increased and moderate right pleural effusions are
again seen.
right basilar atelectasis is present. Subtle left upper lung
opacity is little changed from the prior study. There is no new
consolidation.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.

Radiology Report CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2142-3-30**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Dilated esophagus with oral contrast retained proximally,
aerosolized
material filling the remainder, and distal tapering, concerning
for distal
obstruction. Although no mass like lesions is identified,
differential
diagnosis includes malignancy, benign stricture, and achalasia.
Severe
dysmotility is less likely. Oral contrast is also sequestered in
the
oropharynx.
2. Interval placement of left chest tube with new small left
anterior
pneumothorax.
3. New right flank subcutaneous soft tissue edema.
5. Decreased size of right axillary fluid collection.
6. Loculated bilateral pleural effusions, with left pleural
calcifications.

FINDINGS: Comparison is also made to prior CT scan from [**2142-3-30**].
Heart size is enlarged. There are bilateral pleural effusions,
right side
worse than left. There is a left retrocardiac opacity. There is
faint if any density projecting over the mid upper esophagus.
This could correlate with the retained barium seen in this
location on the prior CT scan; however, it is better assessed on
the CT. There is no pneumothoraces. These findings have been
discussed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7867**] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
