Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2127-6-12**]  Cardiac catheterization
[**2127-6-12**] Transesophageal echocardiogram
[**2127-6-18**] Minimally invasive patent foremen ovale closure


History of Present Illness:
46 year old female with history of congenital hollow organ
myopathy s/p multiple bowel resections and subsequent short gut
syndrome on TPN, recurrent PEs, recurrent line infections,
chronic pain on high doses of self administered IM dilaudid
presented to [**Hospital3 **] with a syncopal event at home.

Per patient and family, patient was at home feeling well.  She
flushed her line and started an infusion of NS, and stood up to
walk across the room.  While walking she felt both arms "lose
feeling" and she dropped a cup of tea she was carrying. She then
felt the same numbness in her legs and fell to the ground.  Per
her family she called for help, and when they arrived, she was
unresponsive on the ground.  Her breathing was initially shallow
and she suddenly stopped breathing and her face turned blue.
She then became responsive and resumed breathing and her color
returned.  Of note, patient has had seziures 20 years ago, and
said this felt nothing like her prior seizures.  She also noted
that after the event she felt "fluttering" in her chest, and has
had this sensation with prior line flushes.   EMS arrived and
she was transported to the [**Hospital3 **] ED.

Work up there included head CT and CTA chest which were
unremarkable.  No leukocytosis, no fever.  SBP in 80s.  Troponin
I was initially elevated at 0.17, trended up to 2.36.  EKG
normal. Cardiology was consulted, and thought troponin elevation
was demand in setting of hypotension.  Given cetriaxone or
levaquin in setting of ? line infection and sepsis.  Transferred
at patient request.
Upon echocardiogram here she was found to have a PFO present and
is now being
referred to cardiac surgery for surgical evaluation.

resections, leaving her with a short gut on TPN

Imaging:

ECHO [**2127-6-9**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. The interatrial septum is prominently bowed toward
the right atrium. A patent foramen ovale is present with
right-to-left passage of agitated saline microbubbles with
Valsalva release. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal third of
the ventricle. The basal segments contract normally (LVEF =
35-40 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
dysfunction of the apical left ventricle c/w mid-LAD
ischemia/infarction or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patent foramen
ovale. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study of [**2124-5-3**], the findings are new.

Brain MRI ([**6-10**]):
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of  infarction or hemorrhage.  Unremarkable MRI
examination of the head.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
46 year old woman with h/o congenital hollow organ myopathy s/p
multiple bowel resections and subsequent short gut syndrome on
TPN, recurrent PEs, recurrent line infections, chronic pain on
high doses of self administered IM dilaudid presented to [**Hospital 28941**] with syncope without identified etiology.  She was
initially directly admitted to the MICU from the OSH for
potential sepsis, although she was hemodynamically stable and
antibiotics were discontinued on arrival due to lack of
suspected infection.

Of note, her symptoms consistent with TIAs as well as her
syncopal episode all happened shortly after flushing her line.
She also has seen clots when withdrawing her line in the past.
MRI head was ordered to evaluate for cerebral clots that may
explain prior TIA and possibly syncope. MRI negative for
evidence of infarction.

Initial TTE showed Patent foramen ovale. Her cardiac enzymes
(troponin and CKMB) were elevated at OSH and still elevated on
arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] although down-trending on multiple checks. ECG
showed global T wave flattening that evolved to global T wave
inversions.  Echocardiogram final read showed regional
dysfunction o
