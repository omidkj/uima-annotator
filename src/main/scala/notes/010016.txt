Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding & hepatic encephalopathy

Insertion and subsequent removal of central venous catheters,
peripherally inserted central catheter


History of Present Illness:
58f with HTN, DM2, PVD, HCV cirrhosis admitted [**4-11**] for sepsis
from right heel ulcer with osteo who has since undergone AKA,
course complicated by presumed C. diff, brisk lower gi bleed
felt secondary to rectal tube erosion with tagged rbc scan
showing descending colon bleed followed by angio and
embolization all around [**Date range (1) 23445**], subsequent re-bleed
complicated by volume overload, respiratory distress, asystolic
arrest, now re-extubated with third episode of bleeding. Pt's
initial bleed was associated with hypotension and she as
intubated, occuring around [**Date range (1) 23445**] and was felt to be
sucessfully embolized. She was extubated and her hct dropped
from 35-28, but without unclear bleeding; she was transfused
prbc's and ffp, developed respiratory distress, and had an
asystolic arrest, from which she was resuscitated fairly
quickly. Her hct stabilized, and she was easily extubated on
[**5-18**], when she again developed copious brbpr, and her hct dropped
from 33-21. Her hct stabilized in the MICU with monitoring and
she was found to have a rectal ulcer (likely [**1-13**] prior rectal
tube). After stabilizing, she was called out to the medical
floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Doctor First Name 99356**] is a 58  year old F with HTN, DM2, HCV
cirrhosis, who was admitted on [**4-11**] with right lower extremity
osteomyelitis and sepsis, and following a prolonged hospital
course is now s/p RLE AKA, ICU stay complicated by recurrent GI
bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy.
.
# GI bleed -- During her ICU stay, the patient had multiple
bouts of GI bleeding which were a result of an ulcerated rectal
varix (secondary to rectal tube).  The patient underwent
arteriogram w/ unsuccessful embolization and was tranferred to
the MICU in setting of continued GIB on [**2113-5-17**].  At that time,
she was hemodynamically stable.  However, her hct continued to
drop, requiring multiple transfusions, and GI, surgery, and IR
were involved.  She underwent flex-sig by GI on [**2113-5-19**], which
demonstrated a rectal ulcer, likely due to previous mushroom
catheter.  The site was cauterized, and her hct subsequently
stabilized.  Since moving from the ICU to the medical floor, her
hematocrit has remained stable at ~ 30. We plan to check her Hct
weekly with results reported to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Should the
patient have visible GI bleeding, she should be transferred back
to [**Hospital1 18**] as she could have a life-threatening bleed.
.
#Coagulopathy -- The patient has a persistently elevated INR,
likely from liver disease & malnutrition; over the past week,
her INR has been improving w/ INR 3.0 --> 1.5. Initially, her
coagulopathy resulted in recurrent GI bleed and bleeding from
AKA stump, and the patient was given numerous units of FFP,
cryo, and vitamin K.  At the present time, her INR is stabilized
and continues to improve. Her only bleeding issue is a small
amount of oozing from the lateral aspect of her AKA wound which
should continue to improve over time.
.
# Diarrhea -- The patient had severe diarrhea during her
hospital stay. She was treated for C diff (despite negative C
diff stool samples) with vancomycin and flagyl. The patient has
a long history of diabetic enteropathy causing profuse diarrhea.
We started the patient on clonidine 0.1 mg TID with improvement
in her diarrhea to [**1-14**] BMs daily. She was previously on
lactulose for her liver disease which may have been contributing
to her diarrhea; this was discontinued though the patient was
kept on rifaximin. Repeat C diff on [**5-29**] also negative. Her goal
is [**1-14**] BMs daily. She should continue to use lomotil and
tincture of opium as necessary to achieve [**1-14**] BMs daily. If she
has fewer than [**1-14**] BMs daily, this may cause encephalopathy due
to her known cirrhosis. The patient should be monitored closely
for confusion in this setting.
.
# Renal insufficiency -- The patient had transient acute renal
failure likely due to fluid shifts resulting in pre-renal
stat
