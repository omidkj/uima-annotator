Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo m w cirrhosis and varices admitted for an upper GI bleed x
2. The following issues were investigated during this
hospitalization:
.
1) GIB: Shortly after admission to the ICU the pt. having
massive hemoptysis with resultant hypotension. He was scoped
emergently after intubation and found to have stage 3 variceal
bleeding which was unable to be stopped with banding. He was
started on Protonix and Octreotide drips with Ciprofloxacin
prophylaxis. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] esophageal balloon was placed with
stabilization of bleeding.  He required 12U pRBCs and 7U FFP on
HD1. A TIPS was successfully placed on [**12-8**], but followed by
continued bleeding. He was transfused once more on [**12-22**].  A RUQ
u/s on [**12-21**] an [**12-23**] confirmed patency of TIPS. His hematocrit
remained stable after the transfusion on [**12-22**] and he was
transferred to the general medicine floor for continued
management.
.
2) Liver disease: Etiology is unclear but has been described as
NASH and cryptogenic in nature. There is no report of a liver
biopsy. During this hospitalization, initial work-up revealed
negative hepatology serologies and no evidence of
hemochromotosis. An abdominal CT showed a 1.5 cm lesion in the
right lobe of the liver and AFP is elevated to 13.7. Additional
work-up was deferred given his acute medical problems
necessitating ICU hospitalization. He should pursue further
work-up of this lesion as an outpatient. An appointment has been
scheduled for him in the liver clinic here at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
3) Altered mental status - Etiology unclear, but initially
concerning for anoxic brain injury in the setting of hypotension
upon presention, but repeat imaging showed resolution of initial
changes, which was more suggestive of resolving metabolic
condition (i.e. hepatic encephalopathy). Infectious work-up in
the MICU was negative. On the general floor, the patient was
maintained on Lactulose and Rifaximin for ammonia control. His
mental status gradually and significantly improved and he was
noted to be awake, alert and oriented x 3, often communicative.
He was discharged on Rifaximin and Lactulose, which he should
continue given his TIPS.
.
4) Seizure activity: Patient was observed to be have brief
episodes of tonic-clonic seizure activity on [**12-13**], and
subsequently found to have frequent, intermittent seizure
activity on EEG in the following 24 hours essentially c/w status
epilepticus. He was seen by the neurolog
