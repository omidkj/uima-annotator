Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4760**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
67 yo AAM w PMHx of COPD on 4L home O2 and nightly bipap, HTN,
chronic LBP, presented to ED w LLQ abd pain. Pt was given
levaquin in ED (has noted allergy to it) and developed rash on
his forearms. On floor, he also developed tachypnea and
transferred to ICU. Per ICU team, they think it was likely from
not using bipap; initially they did not believe had COPD
exacerbation or drug reaction. He was continued on prednisone
taper. For his diverticulitis he was started on Rocephin and
flagyl. He was never intubated. Pt was transferred to the floor
the next day. Currently he reports his sob at baseline, denies
cp and denies abd pain. He had noted mild hematochezia prior to
admission but none since. He denies nausea, vomiting. He thinks
the rash is improving
ROS: otherwise neg

CT Abd/Pelv:
1. Very mild stranding adjacent to the diverticula in the
proximal sigmoid
[**Month/Day/Year 499**], which may reflect presence of mild or early acute
uncomplicated
diverticulitis.
2. Severe emphysema.
3. Right basal bronchiectasis with associated patchy
consolidation.



Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo AA male w PMHx of severe COPD on 4l home O2, nightly
bipap, HTN, chronic LBP presented w/ diverticulitis.
.
MICU Course [**Date range (1) 19030**]:
The patient was doing well on the floor nearing discharge for
home on tapered steroids and a course of antibiotics when he
developed acute respiratory distress with tachypnea and
shortness of breath. The patient reportedly awoke from sleep
needing to go to the bathroom. After removing his overnight
BiPAP device and attempting to ambulate to the toilet, he was
found yelling for help with severe shortness of breath and
tachypnea. Vitals at that time were 97.0 93 115/60 22 98% while
receiving a nebulizer treatment. On exam, he was noted to have
minimal air movement and ABG revealed a respiratory acidosis
7.28/66/150, but bicarb 32 indicating chronic respiratory
acidosis, PCO2 never noted to be below 50. The patient received
solumedrol 125mg once and nebulizers. The patient was
transferred to the ICU for further respiatory care. On arrival
to the ICU the patient appeared comfortable and reported he was
back at his baseline.  He was given standing nebulizers, and his
steroid dose was increased to 40 mg daily and he was given
Azithromycin for what now appeared to be a COPD flare.
-During his MICU Course, he had 2 more episodes of respiratory
distress noted as tachypnea with lots of anxiety.  Patient
responded well to 1mg of ativan with BiPAP.  It is believed that
there is a large component of anxiety to his resp distress in
addition to his severe COPD.  Also patient often refused nebs.
We discussed that the patient need scheduled Nebs when he has a
flare and can go back to PRN when he is out of the hospital.  He
was continued on nightly BiPAP and prednisone for presumed COPD
flare.
.
The following is his course on the floor:
.
# COPD flare: As described above in his MICU course, Mr. [**Known lastname 19017**]
has severe COPD with steroid and oxygen dependency.  He had 2
episodes of respiratory failure requiring ICU admission.  He was
treated with IV steroids, as well as ativan for anxiety, and
also with azithromycin.  He was also treated with prophylactic
bactrim given his high steroid requirement. The patient was
treated with a prednisone taper. He was tapered down from 60 mg
daily, in increments of 5 mg less every 3 days. He had been on
prednisone 10 mg daily at home, and should probably increase to
20 mg daily at home. He will be tapered down to 20 mg daily. He
was continued on tiotropium, advair, and albuterol/atrovent
nebs. He will need outpatient follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] of
pulmonary. He also remains on 4 L NC and BIPAP at 12/5 at night.

#Diverticulitis.  He was admitted with abdominal pain, and was
found to have mild diverticulitis.  He was initially started on
IV antibiotics (CTX/flagyl), and subsequently transitioned to PO
antibiotics with augmentin to complete a 10 day course.  He was
tolerating an oral diet, and having normal bowel movements.  He
likely would not tolerate a colonoscopy to further evaluate his
[**Last Name (STitle) 499**], but colonoscopy in [**2105**] showed diverticuli, no
malignancy.
.
#Chronic pain.  He has chronic back pain, unchanged from prior,
treated with percocet with good effect. He has been seen in the
pain clinic in the past with trigger point injections and good
relief, so this can be considered in the future.
.
#Hyperglycemia: Likely [**2-6**] chronic prednisone use. His FS ranged
from 80s to low 200s. He required at most 4 U of insulin during
the day. His fingersticks should be monitored with his
prednisone taper with sliding scale insulin as needed.
Consideration can be given to starting low dose lantus if the
patient has persistent low dose insulin requirements with his
prednisone taper.
.
# HTN: BP well controlled on verapamil
.
# CAD: Continued ASA, statin. He was not on BB or ACE. Likely no
BB due to many COPD exacerbations. Low dose lisinopril 5 mg
daily was restarted.
.
# Code: He is full cardiac resuscitation but DNI (do not
intubate). This was discussed with the patient at the time of
discharge.
