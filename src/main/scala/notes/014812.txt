Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
expired


History of Present Illness:
60yo with h.o HTN, BL, LVH, CHF recent admitted for SOB/DOE and
elective myocardial biopsy worsening since [**Month (only) 958**]. He was
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on Sunday (2 days PTA) and began feeling
SOB shortly after arriving at home. Sunday evening he noted DOE
when walking up a flight of stairs and then Monday he was SOB
all day long. He noted it was worse with laying flat. He called
Cardiology here and was instructed to take an extra dose of
torsemide 20mg. That medication did help his symptoms briefly
but he continued to feel very short of breath and presented to
the ED at [**Hospital1 11485**]. He got lasix there and was transferred here.
He reports a mild cough for the past 3 weeks. He states that it
is productive of yellow sputum in the morning. He denies fevers,
chills, wheezing, chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations,
worsening edema. He does report some dizziness on occasion but
states it is not postural. He denies a sensation that the room
is spinning and he denies feeling faint. He reports that he did
faint approximately 3 weeks ago prior to his last admission. He
denies any dietary indiscretion. pt reports [**12-14**] lb weight gain
since discharge.
Recent w/u included thoracentesis of R.sided pleural effusion
with 500cc of transudative fluid, stress echo, TTE, MRI showing
thickening of LV and subendocardium suggestive of amyloidosis.
He was started on high dose steroids and underwent cardiac cath
with myocardial biopsy which was positive for amyloid.
Per BMT notes, the patient was started on chemotx for Multiple
mylema/amyloid. He was scheduled to get Chemotx today (valcaid &
decadron). Pt not ICD or cardiac xplant candidate 2/2 MM. Pt
wished to be DNR/DNI during last admission.
.
In the ED, his vitals signs were as follows: 96.8 74 105/86 18
98% 2L. He was given aspirin 325mg. His Trop at OSH 0.39; he has
CRI. The ED reported EKG changes STE in V3.
ROS: positive for tongue pain r/t canker sore and mild swelling.

positive for poor appetite and 20 lb weight loss over past 5
months.
negative for nausea vomiting, abdominal pain, brbpr, diarrhea,
constiption, dysuria, hematuria, joint pain or muscle aches.

.
CARDIAC ECHO ([**12-18**]):
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-40 %).
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2159-11-27**], right ventricular contractile function is
significantly further reduced.
.
Head CT: ([**12/2159**])
IMPRESSIONS:
1. No evidence of hemorrhage.
2. Prominence of the ventricles out of proportion to sulcal
prominence raises
possibility of noncommunicating hydrocephalus.

.
CArdiac Cath: ([**12/2159**])
COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated right
(RVEDP
21mmHg) and left sided filling pressures (mean PCWP 31 mmHg),
moderate
pulmonary arterial hypertension (56/33/41) and markedly reduced
cardiac
index of 1.2 L/min/m2 (assuming normal O2 consumption). Systemic

arterial pressures were normal.
2. With milrinone infusion up to 0.75mcg/kg/min, cardiac index
increased
to 1.5L/min/m2, with stable pulmonary pressures (54/32/39 mmHg)
and PCWP
(mean 34mmHg).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe biventricular diastolic and systolic dysfunction.
2. Improved cardiac index but unchanged pulmonary arterial and
wedge
pressures with milrinone.


Brief Hospital Course:

Very flat affect.
On citalopram 20mg daily.

# Acute Renal failure [**1-14**] end-stage CHF. Elevated Cr: Cr 2.2,
unclear baseline (? 1.4). Likely from prenal azotemia secondary
to heart failure as well as concurrent furosemide therapy.
