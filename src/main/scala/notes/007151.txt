History of Present Illness:
68 yo M with h/o MDS, thrombocythemia, HTN, COPD and recent GIB
was admitted from NH for decreased HCT (HCT was at baseline 22)
and leukocytosis. He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on the [**Hospital Ward Name **] between [**3-22**] - [**4-13**] for a massive GIB, DVT, and
cholecystitis. That hospitalization was summarized by the
following:
1. GIB: He underwent colonscopy which showed blood in the colon,
sigomid diverticulosis, but no clear source of the bleeding. A
SMA angiogram was significant for extravasation of contrast at
the distal ileocolic branches, which was successfully embolized.
He received a total of 10 U pRBC and 10 U FFP while in the MICU.
He was discharged with a HCT of 22, stable.
2. DVT: Pt has a h/o of DVT and spelic thrombosis. Had been on
coumadin, but this was reversed with Vit K when had GIB. Lenis
during last admission showed appearing L superficial vein DVT.
An IVC filter was placed. He was restarted on coumadin before
discharge.
3. Cholecystitis: He was noted to have worsening abd pain and
elevated LFTs. RUQ US showed concern for cholecystitis. He
underwent cipro, flagyl, and unasyn and then underwent an ERCP
in which a stone was removed from the biliary tree, a
sphincterotomy was performed, and the CBD was noted to be
dilated to 12 mm. He is scheduled for a CCY in the future,
although several providers have disagreed as to whether or not
he really needs this.
4. PNA: he was treated for PNA with ceftriaxone and azirhtomycin
via PICC on discharge to finish the course on [**4-19**].
.
He was discharged to a NH on [**4-13**] with a PICC in place for abx.
He was readmitted tot he 11R floor for anemia (though HCT was
stable). He was transfused 1 unit of PRBC on [**4-18**] to which his
HCT did not respond (know to be very difficult crossmatch). Attg
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his hematologist, felt that he has some degree of
slow GIB still. IVC gram done to assess clot burden and showed
that there was clot above the filter and could extend into the
hepatic vein entry. IR was consulted who rec thrombolytics. This
was performed on [**4-19**] in the afternoon. The patient was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring after this
procedure. He was continued with an infusion of TPA overnight
that was infused through a catheter extending the length of the
clot and then was taken back to the IR suite on [**4-20**] and imaging
showed that the clot had broken up a little. He was placed in a
supine position and plan was to try to do a thrombectomy, but
the patient began developing chest pain. This resolved as soon
as he was placed on his back again.
.
On arrival to the MICU he states he is feeling well and that the
chest pain was very fleeting - it was only present when he was
lying on his stomach and is now completely gone. Denies any SOB,
abd pain, or palpitations.


Past Medical History:
1. DVT RLE ([**2105**]) hospitalized
2. Aortic Regurg ([**7-/2101**]) LVEF 60-65%
3. Influenza A--> "coma" for 21 days ([**2100**]) Pt admitted to [**Hospital1 **]
for respiratory distress. Dignosed w/ influenza or PNA. pt was
intubated. cultured MRSA. RUQ ultrasound showed a hypoechoic
pancreas and sludge in the gallbladder. He was subsequently
extubated and did better. He received antibiotics. Incidentally
was diagnosed with Anemia and manocytosis so got Bone Marrow
Biopsy.
4. Anemia/ Manocytosis (myelodysplastic syndrome), very
difficult blood type match. on epogen
5. hemochromocytosis or sideroblastic anemia? [**2100**]
6. Pancreatitis: [**2100-1-15**] during ICU admission.
7. HTN: well controlled with Tiazadone
8. Gout: controlled with Allopurinal 300 daily
9. COPD "breathing much improved since stopped smoking 9 months
ago".
10 Scarlet fever as child.
11. Essential thrombocythemia: normally on antiplatlet agents,
held in anticipation of surgery


Social History:
1-2 packs per day for > 50 years (began whe he was 9 and just
stopped 9 months ago). Pt has positive alcohol history: claims
to have stopped or greatly reduced drinking, but did report in
[**2100**] drinking [**2-18**] six- packs per day on the weekends, 2-3 beers
a day during the week.


Family History:
Mother died in 80s not sure what from. His father has
hypertension- died in his 60s from heart attack?. 2 siblings are
alive and in good health. Son has asthma.

Physical Exam:
98.1, 155/69, 107, 93% on 2L NC
Gen - Alert, no acute distress but then transiently becomes very
sleepy and is hard to keep awake, but then will wake up and be
conversant.
HEENT - extraocular motions intact, anicteric, mucous membranes
dry
Neck - no JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy
Chest - slight end exp wheeze
CV - Normal S1/S2, RRR, III/IV SEM rad to carotids biaterally

Pertinent Results:
Micro:
[**2-19**] bcx positive for coag neg staph
cdiff neg x1
.
Rads:
[**4-19**] IVC gram: clot above the filter
[**4-18**] CT abd: PNA vs. small PE's; There is a large clot burden
extending from the IVC just proximal to the insertion of the
hepatic veins down the IVC through the known IVC filter into the
common iliac veins and through the superficial and deep femoral
veins bilaterally. Stable RP LN. no abscess
[**4-17**] RUQ US: No definite evidence of acute cholecystitis. No
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. CBD not seen.
[**4-17**] CXR: No pneumonia noted. Left basilar atelectasis.
[**4-22**] CXR: The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged with
pulmonary vascular redistribution and small bilateral pleural
effusion suggesting an element of fluid overload.  The right
subclavian line with tip in the SVC is unchanged. There is
subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 68 yo m with a h/o MDS, anemia, ETT, recent large GIB, now
with large clot burden of DVT extending into the IVC:
.
#) DVT s/p thrombolysis: Required thrombolysis since his clot
burden was rising above the filter in the IVC. IR tried three
times to do thrombectomies but they reported that flow was still
sluggish in the veins (likely [**2-17**] distal clot they were not able
to reach?). TPA was infused overnight on several occasions but
repeat venogram still showed substantial clot. IR felt there
were no further interventions available. The patient was taken
off of coumadin and started on lovenox with the thought that
this might be slightly better at preventing further extension of
clot. The patient was informed that it may take months for this
clot to dissolve and the risk of further progression as well as
embolization is very real. For now he will continue on lovenox,
aspirin, anagrelide and hydrea. Lovenox levels should be checked
periodically by measuring Factor Xa levels (therapeutic is
between 0.6 and 1.0). Level checked before discharge was 0.9.
.
#) SOB/hypoxia: Has some wheezing, crackles and decreased BS at
the bases. O2 sats to high 80s when sleeping on 2 L NC and
increased to 4 L NC in the setting of SOB and satting in high
90s. Also, likely PEs contributing, but did not confirm with CTA
given would not change management. During previous admssion he
required small amounts of nasal cannula oxygen intermittently
which was attributed likely secondary to volume overload and
atelectasis. He also has a history of COPD. On last discharge
his pulse ox on room air was 88% and on 2L was 97%. CXR with
small b/l pleural effusions and overload and LL atelectasis. He
was intubated for IR procedure on [**4-25**] and TEE, and after
extubation required facemask ventilation. His breathing seemed
to improve with diuresis (was given 20IV lasix daily for approx
a week) and he requ
