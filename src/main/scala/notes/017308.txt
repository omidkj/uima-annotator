HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 28-year-old female
patient with a history of ALL status post chemotherapy,
radiation therapy, and BMT, pancreatitis secondary to
gallstones, status post cervical esophageal patch after
esophageal perforation from dilation of a stricture,
Barrett's esophagus, esophageal dysmotility, GERD, history of
aspiration pneumonia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypothyroidism, who presents with hypoxia and a new oxygen
requirement after endoscopy.  The patient was scheduled for
an upper endoscopy under general anesthesia because of a
history of an apneic episode during attempted procedure in
[**2168-11-17**] which was determined to be secondary to
aspiration pneumonia.  During the procedure, the patient had
notable bronchospasm and before the esophagus was intubated,
the scope was pulled for desaturation and hypotension
considered secondary to inadequate sedation.  The patient's
hypoxia and hypotension resolved and sedation was increased
by anesthesia.  The patient then underwent an uncomplicated
EGD but postprocedure had noted decreased breath sounds and a
chest x-ray which was significant for a right main stem
bronchus intubation.  Given a low oxygen saturation and
rhonchorous breath sounds, the patient was transferred to the
MICU for observation after extubation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
101.3, BP 117/60, heart rate 125, respiratory rate 30, oxygen
saturation 92% on 6 liters nasal cannula plus 0.4% FI02 on
shovel mask.  General:  The patient is awake, alert, and
oriented in mild respiratory distress, cooperative.  HEENT:
Left surgical pupil.  Right pupil round and reactive to
light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Dry mucous membranes.
The oropharynx was clear.  There were dentures present in the
upper mouth.  Pulmonary:  There were bibasilar rales and
diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac, regular rhythm, normal S1, S2.
No evidence of murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, multiple surgical scars, well-healed
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No evidence of
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. There were palpable pulses, 2+
bilateral DP pulses.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented times
three.  Muscle strength was [**3-22**] throughout.  Sensation:
Intact to light touch.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  None on admission.

Chest x-ray revealed right main stem ET tube, bilateral
basilar atelectasis, right worse than left, low lung volumes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  HYPOXEMIA:  The patient was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit Service after an EGD that was
complicated by a right main stem bronchus intubation and
subsequent hypoxemia and increased oxygen requirement.  The
etiology of the patient's hypoxemia was considered most
likely related to atelectasis secondary to the right main
stem bronchus intubation versus aspiration pneumonia.  The
patient was started on Albuterol and Atrovent for underlying
obstructive lung disease and placed on supplemental oxygen as
needed for oxygen saturations over 90%.  The patient did not
require any noninvasive positive pressure ventilation but
continued to require oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain
adequate oxygen saturation.

The patient was transferred to the Medicine [**Hospital1 **] on hospital
day number three and was started empirically on levofloxacin
and Flagyl for concern of aspiration pneumonia given
continued low-grade fevers as well as crackles more
significant in her left lung field and a questionable
infiltrate on chest x-ray.  Over the course of her stay on
the Medicine Floor, the patient defervesced and had a
decreasing oxygen requirement.  Incentive spirometry was
encouraged for possible atelectasis.  The patient complained
of left-sided pleuritic chest pain and given her concomitant
tachycardia, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen saturations, a
chest CTA was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism.  The
chest CTA showed no evidence of PE but was significant for
multiple mediastinal supraclavicular and hilar
lymphadenopathy with ground glass opacities in the lingula
and an apical left nodule measuring 1.3 by 0.9 cm.

The Pulmonary Consult Service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and evaluated the
patient for her continued hypoxemia and CTA findings.  They
felt that the patient's increased oxygen requirement and
hypoxemia was likely multifactorial and related to her
elevated right hemidiaphragm, left lingular ground glass
opacity, mild obstructive disease, and moderately severe
restrictive disease by recent PFTs.  The patient's records
from [**Hospital6 1708**] were obtained and notable
for the left apical nodule.  A speech and Swallow study was
ordered, the results of which are pending at the time of
dictation and it is anticipated that the patient will
follow-up with her pulmonologist at [**Hospital6 15291**] for a possible right diaphragm fluoroscopy to rule
out paralysis as well as PFTs pre and post bronchodilators.

The patient's oxygen requirement decreased throughout her
hospitalization and she was saturating 95% on 1 liter on the
day of discharge.  Given a desaturation to 83% on room air
with ambulation the patient was discharged with home oxygen
and close follow-up with her pulmonary physician.

2.  ESOPHAGEAL DYSMOTILITY:  The patient presented originally
for an EGD that was significant for diffuse erythema and
congestion of the mucosa in the whole stomach, nodules in the
stomach body, Barrett's esophagus, and an otherwise normal
EGD.  Biopsies were performed, the results of which are
pending at the time of dictation.  The patient was continued
on her outpatient doses of Reglan and Pantoprazole for reflux
symptoms.

3.  TACHYCARDIA:  The patient was noted to be tachycardiac on
transfer to the Medicine Floor from the ICU.  This was
considered likely secondary to dehydration and the patient
was given IV fluids with improvement in her tachycardia.
EKGs were obtained which showed no evidence of ischemic
changes.  It is notable that the patient has a baseline
tachycardia.

4.  DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient was continued on
pioglitazone, insulin sliding scale on her home regimen for
neuropathy.  Given some labile blood sugars, standing doses
of Glargine insulin were adjusted throughout this admission.
The patient was also maintained on a diabetic diet with blood
sugars monitored q.i.d.   She was continued on her
pioglitazone and Metformin.

5.  HYPOTHYROIDISM:  The patient was continued on her
outpatient dose of levothyroxine.

6.  GOUT:  The patient was continued on colchicine and
Allopurinol per her outpatient regimen.

7.  METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS:  The patient
has a prior diagnosis of MR
