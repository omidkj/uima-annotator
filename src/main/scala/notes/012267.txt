Cardiac Cath [**2153-2-23**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated no
angiographically apparent flow limiting coronary artery disease.
The
LMCA was without flow limiting stenosis. The LAD and its two
small
diagonal branches were without flow limiting disease. The Ramus
Intermedius was without flow limiting disease. The LCX and its
moderate
sized OM1 were without flow limiting disease. The RCA was a
dominant
vessel without flow limiting disease. Small vessels supplying
the
presumed left atrial mass were seen originating from the RCA and
LCX.
2. Left ventriculography demonstrated preserved systolic
function with
LVEF of 60%. No regional wall motion abnormalities seen. No
mitral
regurgitation seen.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated systemic systolic
hypertension of 177/81. There was elevated left sided filling
pressures
with LVEDP of 20mmHg. No aortic stenosis gradient seen on
catheter
pullback.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically apparent flow limiting coronary artery
disease.
2. Mild diastolic LV dysfunction.
3. Moderate systemic hypertension.

[**2153-2-28**] Chest X-Ray
Mild cardiomegaly and improving CHF. No pneumothorax. Status
post extubation, right IJ line removal and removal of
mediastinal tubes, chest tubes and NG tube. No pneumothorax.
Increased bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis.

[**2153-2-26**] EKG
Sinus rhythm 85. Right bundle-branch block. Compared to the
previous tracing the right bundle-branch block is new.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 60922**] was admitted to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Medical
Center on [**2153-2-23**] for further management of her atrial myxoma. A
cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed clean
coronaries. The cardiac surgical service was consulted and Ms.
[**Known lastname 60922**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. On
[**2153-2-26**], Ms. [**Known lastname 60922**] was taken to the operating room where she
underwent removal of her left atrial myxoma with a patch repair.
Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known lastname 60922**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]e neurologically intact and was extubated. Coumadin was
started for anticoagulation for her patch repair. Her drains and
pacing wires were removed per protocol. Later on postoperative
day one, she was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down
unit for further recovery. She was gently diuresed towards her
preoperative weight. Ms. [**Known lastname 60922**] became tachycardic for which
beta blockade was started and adjusted for optimal heart rate
and blood pressure control. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with her postoperative strength and
mobility. Ms. [**Known lastname 60922**] continued to make steady progress and was
discharged home on postoperative day four. She will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist and her primary care
physician as an outpatient.
