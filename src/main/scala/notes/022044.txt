Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 50378**] is a 56 year old male with CAD s/p CABG who
presented with 3 days of vomiting and diarrhea and was admitted
with shock, respiratory failure, and acute on chronic renal
insufficiency.  His hospital course is outlined by problem
below:
.
#1. Multifactorial Shock:  This is suspected to be from sepsis.
CT Abd showed +enteritis which was the likely source of his
infection.  He was also found to have a LLL pneumonia.  He was
treated with vanc/cefepime.  He was initially treated wtih
flagyl and po vanc to cover C. diff, and this was discontinued
when he had 3 negative C. diff tests.  Vanco IV, Vanco PO and
Flagyl were discontined in the ICU.  He was contined on Cefepime
IV for treatment of Enteritis and PNA.  He also had adrenal
insufficiency given his empty sellar syndrome and was started on
stress dose hydrocort and fludrocort.  Symptoms improved and he
was transferred to the medical floor.  He completed a 7 day
course of antibiotics and was discharged home in stable
condition.
.
#2. Panhypopituitarism:  Pt was started on stress dose steroids
and continued on his levothyroxine dose.  Endocrine was
consulted and recommended Prednisone taper; he was discharged on
5 mg po daily of prednisone to be further tapered by his
endocrinologist as an outpatient.
.
#3. Respiratory failure:  Patient was intubated in the ICU for
respiratory failure. This was likely due to underlying metabolic
acidosis.  He was extubated [**12-2**] and had no sequelae.
.
#4. Demand ischemia:  Patient had positive cardiac biomarkers,
most attributable to subendocardial/demand ischemia in the
setting of obstructive CAD, systemic illness, hypotension, and
decreased renal clearance.  He was treated with ASA, statin. No
further issues with this once his infection and associated
hypotension were treated.
.
#5. Vomiting/diarrhea:  Pt had negative stool cultures and
serial C. diff toxin assays.  Likely [**3-9**] enteritis.
.
#6. Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  This improved with volume
resuscitation (with bicarb) and treatment of underlying sepsis.

.
#7. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency:  Creatinine elevated
on admission likely in the setting of sepsis and hypotension.
Renal was consulted and diagnosed ATN.  He was treated with IVF
and Creatinine trended down to 2.6 on discharge.
.
#8. ETOH use:  Pt had some tremors, tachycardia, and
hypertension in the ICU.  He was started on a CIWA scale but did
not require medications.  He was treated with MVI, folate and
thiamine.
.
#9. Hypertension:  Patient became hypertensive in the ICU prior
to transfer to the medical floor.  Fludrocortisone was
discontinued and he was started on his home carvedilol.  His
lisinopril was held given renal failure. On discharge, his blood
pressure was within normal range.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 50378**] was deemed medically stable and fit for discharge to
home. He will have close outpatient follow-up within two weeks
of discharge with his primary care provider.
