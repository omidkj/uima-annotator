Admission Date:  [**2113-5-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2113-5-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**2038-11-17**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old
Spanish-speaking gentleman who, prior to admission, had
symptoms of progressive angina; specifically, exertional
angina.  The patient was referred by his primary care
physician for outpatient stress test and cardiac
catheterization.

He underwent echocardiography on [**2113-4-28**], and the
impression from that test was no echocardiographic evidence
of inducible ischemia to achieved workload.  He also
underwent an exercise tolerance test on [**2113-4-28**], which
showed anginal-type symptoms with probable ischemic
electrocardiogram changes.  On [**2113-4-24**], he also had an
echocardiogram which showed moderate aortic stenosis, mild
aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic
function.  A note from this echocardiogram was that based on
the [**2109**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis guidelines, that the
echocardiogram findings from this test indicated a moderate
risk, and that he should receive prophylaxis in the future.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: (Significant for)
1.  Osteoarthritis of the lower back.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  High cholesterol.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Meclizine 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.,
Cozaar 100 mg p.o. q.d., atenolol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Isordil 40 mg p.o. t.i.d., Relafen as needed, aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a cardiac
catheterization on [**2113-5-4**], which showed pulmonary artery
pressures systolic between 32 and 56, and diastolic between
18 and 26.  The aortic pressures were 190/70.  The left
ventricular pressures were 210/28.  He was also found to have
an ejection fraction of 65%, 70% stenosis of the left main,
and 2-vessel disease.  Based on this, and the patient's
history, it was decided that the patient would undergo a
coronary artery bypass graft which was planned for the
following day.

On [**2113-5-5**], the patient underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft times three with internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to
the posterior descending artery and the obtuse marginal.
Indication for this was aortic stenosis and cardiac
catheterization results as well as worsening angina.  The
aortic valve was replaced with a pericardial tissue heart
valve of a bovine origin.

One additional note is that, after cardiac catheterization,
the patient had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed
preoperatively, and then the following morning went to the
operating room.  The patient's primary cardiologist,
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2031**], was involved with his care leading up to
the surgery.  The patient had an uncomplicated perioperative
period.  He was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit.  He did receive 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
The patient was stable and the balloon pump was removed, and
he was transferred to the floor on postoperative day two, and
on postoperative day three the patient was transfused with 2
units secondary a hematocrit of 19.8.  With that hematocrit
he was also complaining of some dizziness, and this was
making ambulating difficult.  However, gradually worked with
Physical Therapy and was ambulating around the hallway with
assistance, and his hematocrit on discharge was 26 and
steadily rising.

On the floor, the patient occasionally had a increased heart
rate with some premature ventricular contractions.  This was
treated successfully with increased Lopressor, which he
tolerated, and the patient was in sinus rhythm on discharge.
The patient required aggressive respiratory treatments in
order to maintain his oxygen saturations, which he did
adequately.  On discharge his lungs were clear with some mild
crackles at the bases.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 3.  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.
 4.  Isordil 40 mg p.o. t.i.d.
 5.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
 6.  Meclizine 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
 7.  Cozaar 100 mg p.o. q.d.
 8.  Percocet 5 one to two tablets p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.
 9.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
10.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
11.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
12.  Dulcolax suppository 10 mg p.r. q.d. p.r.n.
13.  Motrin 400 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.
14.  Serax 15 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
15.  Benadryl 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Improved and stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient was to go to a rehabilitation
facility.

DISCHARGE DIET:  Low-sodium/low-fat diet.

DISCHARGE GOALS:  Physical therapy for increased mobility,
wound care as needed, respiratory care, and improvement of
his activities of daily living.  Rehabilitation potential was
good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft times three.
2.  Status post aortic valve replacement (Bovine).
3.  Status post cardiac catheterization on [**2113-5-4**].
