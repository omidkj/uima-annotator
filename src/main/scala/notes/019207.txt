History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 77670**] is an 83 year old female with known aortic
stenosis and new onset atrial fibrillation. In preperation for
aortic valve replacement she underwent cardiac catheterization
which revealed only a 70% lesion in the first diagonal artery.
Her coronaries were otherwise normal. Her LVEF was estimated at
60% and there was mild mitral regurgitation.  On echocardiogram,
she had severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 68mmHg.
There was moderate mitral regurgitation. Prior to surgery, her
major complaints were dyspnea on exertion, worsening fatigue and
lower extremity edema. She had no history of syncope.

Pertinent Results:
[**2120-4-25**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: Thoracic aortic contour is intact. Normal RV
systolic function. Mild MR, Mild TR. There is a bioprosthesis in
the native aortic position, stable and functioning well. OVERALL
LVEF 50%.

83 year old woman with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o inf, eff
INDICATION: Evaluate for infection or effusion.

COMPARISON: [**2120-4-27**], [**2120-4-25**].

FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: Median sternotomy wires
and surgical staples overlying the chest are unchanged in
position. Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with retrocardiac opacity
are again seen. There is likely a subpulmonic component to the
left-sided pleural effusion. Improving left upper lobe
atelectasis is seen. Increasing right basilar atelectasis is
present.

IMPRESSION: Persistent moderate bilateral pleural effusions,
with likely subpulmonic component to the left effusion.
Persistent retrocardiac opacity and increasing right basilar
subsegmental atelectasis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 77670**] was admitted and underwent aortic valve
replacement and Maze procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. For surgical
details, please see seperate dictated operative note. Following
the operation, she was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without incident. She maintained stable
hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on postoperative day
two. Warfarin was resumed and Amiodarone was started for atrial
fibrillation. Beta blockade was slowly advanced for rate
control. Over several days, she continued to make clinical
improvements with diuresis. Medical therapy was optimized and
she was medically cleared for discharge to rehab on
postoperative day 5.  With plans for continued diuresis and
coumadin for atrial fibrillation goal INR 2.0-2.5 at rehab.
