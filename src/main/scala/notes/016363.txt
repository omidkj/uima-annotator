Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, hypertensive urgency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2101-10-6**] Redo sternotomy and mitral valve repair with a 28-mm
Physio II annuloplasty ring.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 48684**] is a 61 year old gentleman, with a history of CAD
s/p MI and VSD repair in [**2094**], and recently diagnosed 2-vessel
disease and moderate-severe mitral regurgitation with plan for
CABG and MVR on [**10-6**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who presented with fatigue,
chest pain and elevated blood pressure.
.
The patient had recently been admitted [**Date range (1) 6958**] at [**Hospital1 5979**] for pre-op work-up for his upcoming surgery.  At that
time cardiac cath showed OM with 70% proximal lesion, LAD with
40% mid lesion and RCA with 100% occlusion, as well as LVEF 50%.
 Echo was notable for LVEF 45-50%, moderate regional LV systolic
dysfunction with basal inferior hypokinesis/akineis and
hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferoseptal and inferolateral
walls, as well as mitral posterior leaflet tethering with
moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
.
He had been feeling well until the morning of admission when he
got up and felt "lousy."  He reports that he felt tired with
unclear thinking and went back to bed.  He was awakened in the
late morning by VNA, who measured his blood pressure to be
200/85.  The patient went out to run errands and felt tired
after returning.  He then began to experience brief tingling
"sparkler" sensation in his chest, accompanied by
lightheadedness, diffuse sweating and intermittent nausea.  He
had no visual changes, headaches, vomiting or abdominal pain.
Dr.[**Name8 (MD) 5572**] NP then called to encourage him to go to the
hospital.  At [**Hospital6 3105**], he wasa given nitro
paste and started on a nitro drip, with which his chest
discomfort dissipated.  He was also given lorzepam.  He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient
had initial vital signs were 97.6 64 186/86 98% 4L NC.  He was
continued on a nitro drip.  On initial evaluation by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], it was noted that the patient had increased
creatinine, in the context of recently restarting lisinopril 10
mg daily.  There was concern for renal artery stenosis.  It was
recommended that he wean down on his nitro drip and start Imdur.
 On transfer, vital signs were 97.8 61 142/45 13 96% on 2L

Pertinent Results:
Pertinent results:
EKG on admission [**2101-10-3**]: Q waves inferiorly and 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**]
elevation in II and aVF.  LVH with repolarization changes.  No
change from prior.

Renal artery ultrasound [**2101-10-4**]:
Normal sized kidneys, without evidence of hydronephrosis or
renal artery stenosis.

PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Mild spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
the basal and mid inferoseptal walls. There is hypokinesis of
the basal and mid inferior wall. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%). Intrinsic
LV function is likely further depressed given degree of mitral
regurgitation. The remaining left ventricular segments contract
normally. There is an echogenic density in the interventricular
septum that may represent a prior VSD patch repair. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion is
depressed consistent with right ventricular systolic
dysfunction. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is calcium on the
left and non-coronoary cusps. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is restricted motion of the P3
segment of the posterior leaflet. An eccentric, posteriorly
directed, wall-hugging jet of at least moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of
surgery.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is on milrinone and epinephrine
infusions. There is a mitral annuloplasty ring in place. There
is a jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation originating from
outside of the annuloplasty ring near the posteromedial
commisure. There is no central mitral regurgitation. A peak
gradient across the mitral valve is 8 mmHg with a mean gradient
of 5 mmHg at a cardiac output of 5.2 L/min. Left ventricular
function is moderately depressed (LVEF = 35-40%). Right
ventricular appears marginally improved. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The aorta is intact after removal of the aortic bypass
cannula.
