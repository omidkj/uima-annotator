Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 70yoF DM, CHF-EF50%, CAD s/p NSTEMI [**1-23**], afib on coumadin
p/w fatigue, depression, non-AG metabolic acidosis.
.
# SOB/CHF - Per patient began having SOB/DOE in the 5 days prior
to admission.  It's unclear if this is secondary to poor po
intake and dehydration or worsening of her CHF.  On CXR while
inpatient, there was evidence of worsening CHF with right
pleural effusion.  Crackles in right lung base on exam & LLE
edema.  Lasix was initially held on admit for ARF and
hypernatremia.  Continued to maintain appropriate 02 saturation
despite apparent fluid overload on lung exam.  Was initially
given fluids for ARF and hypernatremia.  Was restarted on lasix
prior to discharge with appropriate diuresis.  Also continued on
lisinopril and metoprolol during stay, with slight decrease in
metoprolol due to relative bradycardia of 60 bpm.
.
# Non-AG Acidosis -  Per review of recoreds, baseline HCO3
18-27, admission HCO3 12 with an AG of 14 consistent with
hyperchloremic, hyperkalemic non-anion gap MA (likely renal
bicarbonate loss given no history of diarrhea or saline
administration).  Per Winter's formula also had inadequate
respiratory compensation (pCO2 should be 26 but is 36) so has
concurrent respiratory acidosis.  Serum osmols 339, osmolar gap
3 which indicates another solute (ex. toluene) is not
contributing to her acidosis.  GI consult was obtained but
thought this was not consistent with a dumping syndrome from her
prior bypass.  Her bicarbonate levels slowly did increase.
Renal was consulted given concern for RTA, but determined her
acid-base abnormalities were consistent with her chronic renal
insufficiency.  She was continued on lasix per their
recommendation to balance her metabolic acidosis with a
retraction metabolic alkalosis.   Discharged on lasix 40mg po
daily.
.
# ARF on CRI - Cr 2.6 on admission.  Per record review has had
CRI by [**Hospital1 18**] labs since [**10-22**] with baseline Cr from 2.1 - 2.5.
Worsening of renal failure supported by labs.  C/w poor po
intake for several days duration.  FeNa and FeUrea c/w with
prerenal status, also free water deplete with consequent
hypernatremia.  Given gentle fluid resuscitation with resolution
to baseline Cr 2.2.  The day of discharge did have slight
increase to 2.6, likely due to [**Hospital1 **] lasix the day before.  Will
give lasix daily on discharge and hold lisinopril until Cr <
2.5.  Cr to be checked in rehab daily until < 2.5, then weekly.
.
# UTI - Pyuria, bacturia on ED presentation.  Clinically she is
asymptomatic without dysuria but states that she does have
difficulty keeping herself clean given her body habitus.
Treated initially with ciprofloxacin and then completed 5 day
course with Bactrim.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: On Coumadin at home, per report at
alternating 2 - 3mg coumadin.  INR on admission was 9.3 c/w with
continued INR dosing in the setting of ARF and poor po intake.
Coumadin was held until she was within the therapeutic range and
then was restarted and monitored.  Metoprolol was initially held
for hypotension and hyperkalemia on admit but restarted once
these issues had resolved.  Did not tolerate prior doses of
metoprolol (previously 50mg [**Hospital1 **] given bradycardia), will
discharge on Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] with rehab facility physician
to monitor and titrate up as needed/tolerated.
.
# Anemia - No acute GIB, Hct has decreased 1.5 points over two
months and she has no clinical or history of bleeding. Received
1u PRBC in ED.  Anemia is normocytic.  She had a normal
colonoscopy and EGD in [**2152**], however her [**2150**] studies showed
erosions within the GE junction and duodenum.  Iron low at 25.
TSH checked and was found to be normal.  Unclear source of iron
deficiency.  Renal was consulted and thought this may
additionally be due to CRI.  Recommended iron supplementation
until replete, and then consider epoietin injections.  They will
follow her as an outpatient.  She was started on iron
supplementation prior to discharge and will continue Iron 125mg
IV qweek x 8 weeks with follow-up with Renal to discuss
possibility of epoegin.
.
# Depression - Pt reports hx of depression and medication
compliance. Denies suicidal/homicidal ideation upon admit, but
feels guilty, with decreased interest and energy. Seems like s
