Brief Hospital Course:
1)Fever: Unclear whether this was due to pneumonia or viral URI.
 CXR cleared quicly after diuresis in ICU. Sputum grew MRSA, but
pt appeared well.  It was felt in discussion with the pulmonary
team that this likely represented colonization rather than MRSA
pneumonia.  She was treated conservatively for course of
possible community acquired pneumonia.

2)SOB: Hypoxia on arrival to ICU.  Improved shortly there after.
 Unclear whether represented pulmonary edema in setting of htn
or pneumonia.  Diuresed to 4 pounds below normal weight
(euvolemic weight approx 98-100 lbs).  Once on the floor
diuresis was discontinued as pt had developed hyponatremia.
Case was discussed with pt's cardiologist, pulmonologist, and
[**Name (NI) 3390**].  [**Name10 (NameIs) 3390**] asked to send pt home on prn lasix regimen - lasix 20
mgs po only if gains weight from one day to next.  Echo
unchanged.

3)Htn:  Pt continued on atenolol 50, imdur 60. She had recently
had losartan dc'd by her cardiologist, who recommended
restarting as her SBPs continued to be in the 140s-150s.  This
was restarted, she did have morning htn to 150s/80s just before
receiving morning meds but was otherwise well controlled
throughout the day.  Cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] see her
in 2 weeks and decide whether losartan needs to be increased.

4)Frequent urination at night.  Post void residual bladder scan
was normal.  This was when pt was not receiving lasix.  Pt
referred to outpt urology.

Send home with telemonitoring and VNA.

Daughter [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 103645**] had multiple concerns throughout the
hospital course, including concern that patient was not safe for
home.  Meeting required with case management and myself due to
inflammatory comments and behavior by pt's daughter to nursing
and physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **].  At end of meeting, daughter seemed
satisfied with discharge plan.
