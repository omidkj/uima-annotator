Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 71290**]
Admission Date: [**2128-1-22**]
Discharge Date: [**2128-6-2**]
Date of Birth:  [**2128-1-22**]
Sex:  F
Service:  NBB


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 23829**] was born at 25 and 2/7
weeks gestation, triplet #3, admitted to the NICU for issues
of prematurity. The infant was born to a 27 year-old, G1, P0
now 3 mother with prenatal screens as follows:  Blood type 0
positive, antibody negative, HBSAG negative, RPR nonreactive,
Rubella immune.  This pregnancy was complicated by:  (1)
Conception by IVF with 2 embryos, 3 fetuses, dichorionic and
triamniotic. (2) Diagnosis of twin-to-twin transfusion,
diagnosed at 18 weeks on [**2127-2-2**].  A, which is the donor
and B, the recipient, monochorionic/diamniotic twins were
involved.  This required one amnio reduction in twin B due to
polyhydramnios on [**2127-12-23**] with 800 cc removed and a
karyotype was sent from that sample showing 46XX chromosomes.
This triplet was infant C and not involved in the twin-to-
twin transfusion.  (3) Mother was noted to have vaginal
bleeding on [**2127-12-25**] and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] overnight for
bedrest.  (4) She was admitted with cervical change at 23 and
3/7 weeks gestation on [**2128-1-9**].  She was beta complete on
[**2128-1-11**].  (5) Noted to have significant vaginal bleeding on
the day of delivery and the decision was made to deliver in
the setting of advanced cervical changes and concern about
abruption.  The rest of review of systems was non
contributory except for past medical history for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 4516**] disease and evaluation of repeated negatives.
GBS unknown.  There was no maternal fever. Rupture of
membranes occurred at delivery. There were intraoperative
antibiotics given. This infant emerged by Cesarean section at
8:52 a.m. on [**2128-1-22**] with some respiratory effort. She
received positive pressure ventilation, was intubated in the
delivery room and had Apgars of 5 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes.
She was brought to the NICU for further evaluation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
showed birth weight of 730 grams which is 25th percentile.
Head circumference of 22.5 cm which is 10 to 25th percentile.
Length of 31.5 cm which is 10 to 25th percentile.  She had
bruised facies. The left eye was open.  Right eyelids fused.
Nondysmorphic.  Orally intubated.  Intact palate.  Anterior
fontanel open, slightly full, sutures palpable, normal S1 and
S2, no murmur appreciated.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  No bowel sounds present. Hips stable. Spine
intact.  No rash.  Preemie genitalia. Moving all extremities
spontaneously. Tone appropriate for gestational age.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory: The infant was placed on high
frequency ventilation on admission to the NICU.  She received
2 doses of surfactant therapy and was transitioned to
conventional ventilation by day of life one. She was also
treated with vitamin A to help decrease severity of chronic
lung disease.  Caffeine citrate was initiated on day of life
one in the hopes of early extubation.  She remained on
mechanical ventilation with increasing and decreasing
settings over the next couple of weeks.  Due to increasing
respiratory support, IV steroids were initiated and a 10 day
course was given starting on [**2128-2-6**], ending on [**2128-2-16**].
The infant subsequently extubated to CPAP on day of life 19
which is [**2128-2-10**]. Lasix 3 times a week was initiated on
[**2128-2-28**] for diuretic therapy to support chronic lung
disease.  She then transitioned to nasal cannula on day of
life 61 which was [**2128-3-23**].  Pulmonary consultation was done
on [**2128-5-6**] by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37305**]. Then as infant progressed
closer to discharge, need for oxygen remains. The infant will
be discharged to home on 50 cc nasal cannula flow at 100%
FI02.  The infant remained on caffeine citrate until
[**2128-4-6**], day of life 75. The infant has had no spontaneous
apnea/bradycardia at rest since [**2128-5-9**]. Most recent spell
was with feeding 3 days prior to discharge from the NICU and
that was feed coordination related. She will be discharged to
home on the nasal cannula oxygen as previously mentioned,
along with Lasix 3 times a day Monday, Wednesday and Friday
to support chronic lung disease. She will have outpatient
follow-up with pulmonary clinic and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37305**] as an
outpatient.

Cardiovascular: The infant presented with symptoms of PDA on
newborn day and was treated.  She actually had an
echocardiogram done that day which showed a moderate to large
PDA. The infant received a single course of Indomethacin for
that. She has had follow-up echocardiograms done since that
and the post Indocin echocardiogram showed no PDA on
[**2128-1-26**].  Repeat Echocardiogram was done on [**2128-1-29**] showing
again, no PDA but a present PFO at that time.  Another
echocardiogram was done on [**2128-2-6**] which showed no PDA but
again, the PFO was present.  Follow-up echocardiogram was
done to rule out pulmonary hypertension on [**2128-4-22**] as
recommended by pulmonology. At that time, there was mild
tricuspid regurgitation. Right ventricular pressure was
greater than [**12-23**] systemic levels.  There have been no further
echocardiograms.  Echocardiograms may be done as an
outpatient per pulmonary clinic recommendations. At the time
of discharge, the infant does continue to have a murmur which
is PPS and benign, normal heart rates and blood pressures.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  On admission to the
NICU, UVC and UAC were placed. The infant was started on IV
fluids and parenteral nutrition on the newborn day. The
infant remained n.p.o. until [**2128-1-31**], day of life 9 when
enteral feedings were initiated.  The UAC was discontinued on
[**2128-1-26**]. A non-central PICC line was placed on [**2128-2-2**]
with discontinuation of the UVC.  The PICC line that was
placed was non-central, due to poor IV access.  A Boviac was
placed on [**2128-2-9**].  Due to elevated BUN and creatinines on
[**2128-2-4**], creatinine of 2.0 with BUN of 34, renal ultrasound
was done. The renal ultrasound on [**2128-2-5**] and [**2128-2-6**]
both showed decreased diastolic flow. Urine output at that
time was diminished. The urine output then became more brisk
with decreasing concerns for renal issues with normalizing
BUN and creatinine subsequently thereafter. Enteral feedings
were slow to be established due to feeding intolerances over
time and the infant finally achieved full enteral feeding by
[**2128-2-28**], day of life 37, at which time the calories were
further advanced to maximize growth and development. They
were advanced to a maximum caloric intake of 30 calories per
ounce.  The infant is presently taking ad lib p.o. feeds at a
minimum of 130 ml/kg per day and taking approximately 150 to
160 ml/kg per day of Similac 24 calorie per ounce. The infant
was also started on vitamin E and Fer-In-[**Male First Name (un) **] once the
calories reached 24 calories per ounce which was [**2128-3-1**].
Vitamin E has subsequently been discontinued.  The infant
does remain on iron supplementation at this time at 2 mg/kg
per day.  The most recent head circumference is 37 cm.  Most
recent length is  50.5cm. Most recent weight is 3735 grams.  This
infant's growth pattern reveals that the weight is presently in
the 50 to 75th percentile.  Length is presently 25th percentile.
Head circumference is presently 75th to 90th
percentile.

Gastrointestinal:  The infant developed hyperbilirubinemia
requiring phototherapy. The infant received a total of 23
days of phototherapy and had a peak bilirubin level of 4.7
over 0.3 on day of life 2.

Hematology:  The patient's blood type is A positive, DAT
negative. Hematocrit at birth was 45 with a platelet count of
241.  Numerous hematocrits and platelets have been measured
since.  The infant has received numerous blood product
transfusions.  Most recent transfusion was on [**2128-3-29**] day of
life 67 and that was for a hematocrit of 26. She received
packed red blood c
