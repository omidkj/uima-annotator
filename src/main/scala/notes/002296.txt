echocardiograms. Recently she has noticed an increase in fatigue
and dyspnea on exertion. A recent echocardiogram showed moderate
to severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.8cm2.
Her valve is trileaflet. Given the progression of her symptoms
and significance of her aortic stenosis, she has been referred
to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for surgical management.

Pertinent Results:
[**2186-8-7**] Intra-op TEE:
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricle displays normal free wall contractility. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results in the operating room at the time of the
study.

POST BYPASS There is normal global biventricular systolic
function. There is a bioprosthesis located in the aortic
position. It appears well seated. Theleaflets can not be seen.
No significant aortic regurgitation is noted. The maximum
pressure through the aortic valve was 27 mmHg with a mean
gradient of 13 mmHg at a cardiac output near 7 liters/minute.
The effective aortic valve area is in the range of 1.7 cm2.
Remaining valvular function appears unchanged. The thoracic
aorta is intact after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2186-8-7**] where
she underwent an aortic valve replacement (tissue) with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
Post-operative day one found the patient extubated, alert and
oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from
inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative
weight.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on post-operative day four
the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and
pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged to home in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
