Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 81087**] was admitted to the neurosurgery service, in the
ICU. His aspirin was held. Overnight he sundowned requiring
haldol x1. He was also noted to by hyperkalemic and had a
troponin of 0.11. His cardiac enzymes were then cycled but
thought to be likely due to his CRF. He was given dextrose and
insulin to treat his hyperkalemia.

On [**3-12**] he underwent a repeat Head CT which was stable. His
neurological exam was stable as well but he still had multiple
medical issues including hyperkalemia requiring kayexalate 30cc
x 2 and hypoglycemia requiring 10u IV insulin + 1amp D50W. The
patient remained in the SICU due to these issues. He had
increasing dyspnea woth consolidations on CXR and need for
albuterol neds. NGT was inserted.

On [**3-13**], he had hypernatremia (likely hypovolemic) with
increasing Cr. The ICU started albumin, however this was stopped
when Na continued to trend up. Family expressed desire to
transfer pt back to OSH vs Hospice for convenience.
Cardiology was consulted and there recommendations were followed
through.

On [**3-14**], the family decided to initiate goals of care towards
hospice. On [**3-15**] his exam further declined and it was decided to
make him CMO. He expired in the evening of [**2130-3-15**].
