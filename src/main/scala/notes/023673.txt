Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Atrial fibrillation with RVR, CHF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34850**] is a 58 year old male with history of atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
peripheral vascular disease, s/p CVA who presented to [**Hospital 11373**] on [**2185-3-2**] with heart failure exacerbation and atrial
fibrillation with RVR. He presented with a one week history of
increased dyspnea on exertion, PND, 3 pillow orthopnea and
decreased exercise tolerance. Prior to presentation to the
hospital he was unable to transfer from his bed without marked
SOB. At [**Location (un) **], BNP was noted to be elevated and CXR showed
increased interstitial markings. He was seen by Cardiology
consult service who recommended rule out for MI, repeat echo,
beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. He was diuresed and
for his AF initially started on a diltiazem gtt and then
converted to Metoprolol 25mg q6H to treat his heart rate. At
some point during the hospitalization he was started on
amiodarone and cardioverted. He was reportedly hypotensive on
[**3-5**] and therefore the consulting cardiologist requested
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
He was also noted to be in acute renal failure with increase in
creatinine from 1.0 to 2.1 attributed to treatment with lasix,
ACE and beta blocker. He was treated with Duonebs for COPD.
.
On [**2185-2-4**] the patient was hospitalized at [**Hospital3 417**] for
chest pain. He was found to be in 2nd degree heart block
attributed to medications. His digoxin was stopped at that time.
He required intubation transiently. He ruled out for MI. During
that admission he was diuresed, treated with low dose beta
blocker, ACE and diuretics and was started on amiodarone for HR
control.
.
On arrival to the CCU the patient is comfortable. He is
oxygenating well on 2L NC. He is in sinus rhythm.
.


Past Medical History:

Social History:
The patient is disabled. He smokes 1 packs per day - had cut
down before last admission. He has been smoking since [**2141**].
Denies EtOH. He is divorced.

Family History:
Mother died at age 76 with colon cancer. Father died of MI at
age 72. He has 9 children who are alive and well.
.
On review of systems, he does have a prior history of stroke
with minimal residual deficits. He denies any prior history of
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He does have occasional sweats. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for PND, orthopnea, DOE,
ankle edema as above. He denies chest pain, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.

[**2185-3-6**]
PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The heart size is
mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
The lungs are clear with no focal consolidation, pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. No pulmonary vascular congestion is
noted.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic pathology including no heart
failure and no pneumonia.
.
[**3-7**] Echo: The left atrial volume is markedly increased
(>32ml/m2). The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. A small secundum atrial septal defect is
present. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40%). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

IMPRESSION: There is left to right shunting across the
inter-atrial septum seen on color Doppler. After injection of
saline and with the Valsalva maneuver, a few bubbles can be seen
in the right atrium (likely not a large number as left to right
shunting prohibits passage). Moderate LV dilatation with
moderate global hypokinesis (the inferolateral segments have the
worst function). The right ventricle appears mildly
dilated/hypokinetic. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
