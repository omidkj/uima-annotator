hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 64 year old man with a history of CAD, COPD, CHF,
diabetes, and hypertension who presented to the ED from
[**Hospital1 **] with ectopy during a sleep apnea test.  On the night
prior to admission the patient had a sleep study done at
[**Hospital1 **] which showed frequent SVT.  He also complained of
itching during the study.  He was transfered to the ED there
where an ECG showed NSR at a rate of 61 with Q in III, aVF but
no other abnormalities.  BP was 124/79. Patient had a bladder
scan that showed 550 cc of urine but he refused a urinary
catheter. Patient requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED BP was 106/50, HR 65, RR 16, O2 94% RA, T 97.3.
He was given his am meds which included isosorbide mononitrate
60 mg, finasteride 5 mg, lisinopril 5 mg, metoprolol XL 25 mg,
and aspirin 325 mg. At 3 pm his BP was noted to be 73/58. He
denied dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain. He received
500 ml of NS with no change in BP.  At 4:30 BP was 101/49, but
at 7:30 BP was 90/69 and patient was somnolent. He received
another 700 cc of NS and BP was 80/58.
.
ROS: positive for vision changes, headaches.  negative for
fevers, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath,
chest pain, dysuria, abdominal pain, diarrhea, black or bloody
stools.

.
Blood cultures remained negative
.
CXR [**5-29**]: Unchanged appearance of the chest without evidence of
acute
cardiopulmonary disease.
.
ECG: NSR at 60 bpm with normal intervals. Normal axis. Q in III
and aVF. Biphasic TW in III. No change from prior.
.
[**5-29**] Renal US:
1.  No hydronephrosis.
2.  Renal size asymmetry is stable, but raises the possibility
of underlying renal artery stenosis and clinical correlation is
suggested.
2.  Splenomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old man with CHF, CRF (baseline Cr 1.7), CAD and COPD
who presents from ED after developing asymptomatic hypotension
and acute on chronic renal failure after taking his blood
pressure medications.
.
Chronic pain: Mr. [**Known lastname **] suffers from chronic pain in his left
hip s/p hip replacement ([**2135**]) and pain in his left shoulder
secondary to bursitis.  He had previously been treated at the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1193**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1194**] Center ([**2137**]) for left hip pain.   After four doses
of MS Contin, he developed lethargy and hypotension and was
referred to the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Department.  MS contin was believed
to cause the itching present on presentation in addition to
possibly contributing to his hypotension. It was also felt that
his blood pressure medications had been given all together and
this compounded his drop in blood pressure.  Due to the
potential for MS Contin misuse in addition to the above
concerns, he was changed to percocet for pain control.  The pain
service was consulted who recommended Topiramate which was
started on [**6-1**].  He will follow up with the [**Hospital1 **] pain center as
an outpatient and will continue with Mind Body Program.
.
ARF on CKD: On admission, the patient's creatinine had peaked at
4.0 before normalizing.  He was noted to be in non-oliguric
acute renal failure.  The patient was given IVF with resolution
of ARF; his creatinine returned to baseline 1.4.  As his
creatinine responded to fluids, the renal team felt that the
etiology of his renal failure was pre-renal.  Renal US showed
asymmetric sized kidneys.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4090**] as
outpt.  Pt voided well after foley d/c.
.
Hypotension:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with persistent hypotension
despite boluses of NS in the ED.  After work-up in MICU, the
differential was narrowed to include hypotension from
dehydration vs. med related hypotension.  He was able to regain
a normal blood pressure holding his BP meds for short period of
time.  Fluids were also administered.  A renal US was done on
admission to evaluate cause of ARF which showed that the patient
had asymmetric sized kidneys and raised the possibility of renal
artery stenosis in the setting of starting an ACE-I.  The ACE-I
had been stopped on admission due to hypotension, but the renal
team felt that the patient could be restarted on a low dose [**Last Name (un) **].
 Once his blood pressure stabilized, losartan and metoprol were
restarted.  He was kept even fluid-wise.
.
OSA: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a sleep study done which reaffirmed complex
sleep-disordered breathing with partially successful titration
study.  They recommended home therapy at BiPAP 16/13 with 100 mL
of dead space and 4 liters of O2.
.
DM: While in the hospital he was kept on a RISS and was followed
by [**Last Name (un) **].
.
HTN:  Once his blood pressure stabilized he was put back on
Losartan and Metoprolol. Lisinopril and Imdur were held.
.
BPH:  He was continued on Flomax and Proscar.
.
Anemia: The patient's hematocrit ranged between 32-34 which
appears to be his baseline.  Fe studies in [**11-6**] were consistent
with ACD.  We recommend that the patient undergo outpatient
evaluation by hematology for chronically low hematocrit.
.
CAD:  He did have one episode of epigastric abdominal discomfort
while in hospital for which he had serial EKGs and serial
enzymes, which did not show any evidence of an ongoing acute
coronary
