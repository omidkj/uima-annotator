Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
80 yo M with PMH significant for ESRD on HD, CAD s/p
CABG x 3  COPD.Patient discharged 2 weeks ago from [**Hospital1 18**] after
he had a  L subclavian stent placed. He  presented to ED today
from [**Hospital3 **] where he c/o of cough , SOB  weakness,
fatigue and low grade  fever x 1 week. He was diagnosed with
influenza A 1 week ago.
.
In ED he was found to be very tachypneic RR 35 % and SpO2 100%
on a NRB mask. CxR with hyperinflated lung and interstitial
infiltrates. Patient had a CTA of chest to rule out PE after
which ,while he was back in the ED, he   developed  an episode
of SVT. Patient's BP remained stable. VBGs : 7.09/89/95/26 .He
was given 1 lt NS, Levaquin , Flagyl ,Lasix 80 mg , solumedrol
125 mg and bronchodilators. He was intubated  and transferred to
MICU.
Renal was consulted for emergent hemodyalisis. They considered
there was no indication  due to patient's abnormal heart rhythm.
Cardiology -was consulted , no indication for revascularization.
Recommended treating respiratory acidosis.

Physical Exam:
T 98.5 (102.5 ax in ED) BP 105/56  HR 72
AC TV 500 RR 20 PEEP 5 FiO2 0.6
ABGs 7.27/45/186/22

Gen - elderly, chronically ill, pale appearing male in NAD,
Skin - diffuse ecchymosis in abdomen and forearms
HEENT - tube @ 23 cm  sclerae anicteric, slightly dry MM, OP
clear, LAD, neck  ,supple
CV - RRR, +s1/s2, II/VI systolic murmur over LSB and apex
Lungs - limited by poor inspiratory effort, decreased BS b/l,
bilateral wheezing
Abd - Soft, NT, slightly distended, normoactive BS
Ext - no LE edema, DP pulses not appreciated but feet warm to
touch, has R forearm fistula
Neuro - not tested, sedated.


Pertinent Results:
EKGs :
-upon arrival : sinus rhythm, RBBB.
-During episode of SVT: left axis deviation, wide complex
tachycardia, small P waves in DII
-post SVT : RBBB
.
-CxR: hyperinflated lungs , bilateral interstitial infiltrates.

CTA chest:
.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  New nodular opacities in the right lower lobe and right
upper lobe with resolution of the left upper lobe opacity
previously seen.  The rapidity of these changes are more
suggestive of an infectious or inflammatory process. However,
continued followup to ensure resolution is recommended.
3.  Increased density and reticulated appearance to the
vertebral bodies, likely related to renal osteodystrophy.
4. Cardiomegaly and coronary artery disease and more diffuse
atherosclerosis


Brief Hospital Course:
#Respiratory Failure: most likely respiratory failure is
pneumonia in the setting of a patient with a very poor lung
function, as determined by previous PFTs and current CxR.
Additional V/Q mismatch is likely related to a PNA considering
he has fever, cough , secretions and a 2 opacities in RML and
RLL ,c/w multifocal PNA. Was extubated soon after intubation and
has been weaning off of O2.
-s/p course of azithro for possible legionella (legionella ag
negative) and continuing on zosyn for GN's and vanco for gm
positives (and enterococcus in urine).
.
#Respiratory Acidosis: Patient's ABGs c/w  acute respiratory
acidosis, probably related to COPD with probably with
?hypoventilation?, muscular fatigue due to hypoxemia?
pHs improved after patient intubated and then remained fine
after extubation.
.
#PNA: Patient has fever, elevated WBC, infiltrate on CT.
Etiology unclear.
-sputum studies, Urine Legionella Ag negative. DFA for influenza
A and B negative.
-covering with Zosyn (to cover Pseudomonas considering patient
has  bronchieactasis on CT and comes from rehab), Zithromax for
Legionella x 5 days (completed [**5-11**]). Vanco considering he has hx
of influenza infection, could have staph PNA.
-blood cultures neg
--remained afebrile through [**5-16**]. white count elevated but
otherwise no significant signs of infection, most likely due to
steroids. white count stabilized at discharge, minimal O2
requirement.
.
#COPD: Patient has histoty of severe COPD. Was initially given
solumedrol 80 tid which is being tapered. switched to prednisone
and tapered to zero at discharge.
-Continue nebs
-taper steroids quickly
.
#SVT: Patient had episode of SVT in ED. EKG in MICU has remained
within NSR. Per Cardiology, no signs of ischemia.
-Continue following EKG.
-added metoprolol
.
#CP pt c/o one episode of CP on am [**5-15**] with some rate related ST
changes, relieved with BB, Morphine and SLNTG, Enzymes negative
x 3. no recurrence.
.
#Borderline BP: Patients BP has remained systolic 105- 110s
unclear baseline. BP prior to intubation with systolic near
130-150s. Lactate elevated on admission. Most likely related to
hypoperfusion
-Initially held BP meds - now restarting with strict holding
parameters.
.
#CAD:
- Patient on ASA, Plavix, statin. BB added back and going back
up to home dose slowly.
- troponins were flat.
.
#ESRD: pt makes very little urine. HD scheduled for Mon, Wed,
Fri.
-Continue Phoslo and give Epo during dyalisis
-Follow Vanc levels in dialysis.
.
#Lung nodule: seems to have improved per new CT.
-Follow up after PNA has resolved.
.
#Coagulopathy: patient has elevated PTT and PT. D dimer elevated
but no evidence of DIC.
.
#Code status: Discussed with wife extensively who states pt is
definitely DNR/DNI now even though this had been reversed for
the intubation earlier on this admission. Wife is HCP and states
pt has been declining lately and they are prepared if he
declines further to make him CMO.
