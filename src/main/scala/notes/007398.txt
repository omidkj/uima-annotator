Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with BMS to LCx and OM1, PTCA of PL


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1557**] is an 83 year-old male with type II diabetes,
hypertension, coronary artery disease s/p STEMI in [**2137-1-25**]
with BMS to the LAD and in-stent thrombosis managed by PTCA who
presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with worsening shortness of breath.
He reports that he had been doing well at rehab until recently.
He was seen in the office on [**2137-5-1**]. At that time he reported
persistent fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. His blood pressures
at rehab had been lower than usual and his lasix had been held
with resulting lower extremity edema, dyspnea on exertion and
orthopnea. On the morning of the 10th he was satting 98% on 2L
nasal NC. He had a CXR which showed modest congestive heart
failure which was worse compared to 1 month prior. He slept well
the night of the 10th. On the morning of the 11th he was noted
to be more uncomfortable with worsening shortness of breath. He
had significant difficulty breathing when ambulating to the
bathroom. He received 80 mg PO lasix. His shortness of breath
persisted and his oxygen saturation decreased to 92% on 6L NC.
He was transferred to the emergency room.
.
In the emergency room his initial vitals were T: 98.7 HR: 77 BP:
124/64 RR: 20-30 O2: 100% on NRB. His initial EKG was a poor
baseline tracing but shows likely sinus rhythm, normal axis,
normal intervals, no acute ST segment changes compared to prior
from [**2137-3-16**]. He had a chest xray which showed signs of
pulmonary edema. His BNP was elevated at 22,059. His first set
of cardiac enzymes was notable for a troponin of 0.08. He
initially required BIPAP but was transitioned to nasal cannula.
He received aspirin 325 mg, ativan 0.5 mg x 1, lasix 40 mg IV x
1 and was placed on a nitroglycerin drip. His blood pressures
were decreased on the nitroglycerin drip and this was
discontinued. He was transferred to the floor for further
management.
.
On review of systems he denies lightheadedness, dizziness, chest
pain. He reports his shortness of breath is significantly
improved since this morning. He denies chest pain, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria,
hemuaturia or leg pain. He endorses worsening lower extremity
edema, orthopnea and PND over the past week. All other review of
systems negative in detail.

Past Medical History:
# Myocardial Infarction [**1-/2137**], s/p cath with PTCA and 2 stents
placed in proximal LAD. C/b cardiogenic shock and VT requiring
defibrillation/pacing for heart block
# Myocardial Infarction with two stents placed in the RCA in
[**2127**].
# RLE DVT [**3-1**]
# Diabetes: HA1c 6.4% on [**11-30**]. High grade proteinuria X 1 yr.
# Hypertension
# Hypercholesteremia
# Asthma
# Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease (baseline creatinine 2.5 to
2.8)

Social History:
Social history is significant for a long standing history of
smoking prior to his myocardial infarction.  He is now residing
at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab and is not currently smoking.  He does not use
alcohol.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

SELECTED RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:
.
RUQ U/S ([**2137-8-27**])
The gallbladder is collapsed, demonstrating numerous shadowing
stones. No gallbladder wall edema evident. No pericholecystic or
perihepatic fluid identified. Limited imaging of the liver is
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of biloma.
.
CT [**Last Name (un) **]/PEL ([**2137-8-30**])
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleeding.
2. Unchanged abdominal aortic aneurysm.
3. Biliary stent.
4. Large bilateral pleural effusions.
5. Fluid-fluid levels in the small bowel. Correlate for GI
bleeding. These
may also represent vicarious excretion of contrast material from
the recent
catheterization procedure where contrast was administered.
6. Persistent contrast within the renal cortex may be related to
patient's
renal failure and recent contrast administration.
.
R-SIDED DEDICATED RIB FILM ([**2137-9-4**])
A single non-oblique view shows no gross evidence of fracture or
pneumothorax.
..
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY:
TTE ([**2137-8-15**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior, septal walls
and the distal [**12-27**] of the ventricle (multivessel CAD). There is
hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 10-15%). A left
ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional and
global systolic dysfunction. Moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2137-6-10**], the findings are similar.
..
THALLIUM REST TEST ([**2137-8-22**]):
INTERPRETATION:
Following injection of of Thallium Chloride while the patient
was at rest,
static and gated SPECT images were obtained and analyzed. This
study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion
model. The image quality is limited, with suboptimal signal to
noise. The left ventricular cavity size again demonstrates
moderate to severe dilation. Resting perfusion images at 20
minutes and 4 hours reveal moderate to severe perfu
