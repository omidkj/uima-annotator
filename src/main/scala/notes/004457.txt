Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
SDH and tSAH after a Fall on Coumadin


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
88 yo M w/ h/o dementia, Afib, s/p PPM, CHF (on Coumadin), CKD
(baseline Cr 1.5-2.2) p/w fall and found to have SDH and
traumatic SAH.

Pt fell (trip and witnessed, ? LOC, felt to be mechanical) on
his way to coumadin clinic, and went to OSH where his INR was
2.0, and CT head demonstrated small parafalcine SDH and bilat
SAH. He received vitamin K then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  He was
initially admitted to the NSG ICU then transfered to MICU for
[**Last Name (un) **] (at that time did not know baseline Cr), and increasing
bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.  He was placed on keppra ppx.
He was placed on neuro checks and had an trauma survey revealed
minimally displaced, extraarticular distal right radius and ulna
fractures.  On [**7-11**] he had repeat head CT that showed increased
bifrontal SAH and right SDH.  Though CT worse, exam clinically
the same.  Per NSG patient not surgical candidate, but wanted
f/u head CT on [**7-13**].  All anti-coag being held.  Ortho was c/s
and his arm was splinted.  On collaberation w/ family, patient
was thought to be close to his baseline (brief conversation,
walks w/ cane).  Cards also c/s b/c trop leak 0.08, flat ck-mb,
cardiology felt to be in setting of ckd not.  CXR showed
bilateral pleural effusions w/ ? focal consolidation.  Felt to
be all volume related, got 80mg iv lasix x1 w/ good diuresis, on
room air, except for at night.  He is -2L length of stay.

Currently, denies any shortness of breath or chest pain.

Review of systems: denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting,

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 88 year old gentleman with multiple medical
problems who was admitted initially to the Neurosurgery service
for SDH and SAH. He appeared at his neurological baseline (AOx
[**1-27**]). INR was reversed at admission.
.
#SDH and SAH
Neuro: Repeat HCT showed enlargement of right occipital SDH.
Given his multiple medical problems (dementia, CHF with EF 25%,
CRF), he is not a candidate for surgical intervention. No shift
caused by SDH. INR was reversed and he was monitored clinically.
Fall was likely mechanical in nature. On [**7-13**], a repeat head CT
was stable without extension or new hemorrhage. His neuro exam
remained stable throughout his stay. He was followed by
neurosurgery. He was continued on Keppra for seizure
prophylaxis. Per neurosurgery, it was confirmed that he could be
restarted on aspirin 81mg.  He should continue to hold coumadin
until his outpatient appointment with neurosurgery.

#SOB/tachypnea/sCHF
Increasing bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on repeat cxr.
