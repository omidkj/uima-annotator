CXR [**9-18**] - Cardiac size is top normal. There is widening of the
mediastinum, greater on the right side in the right lower
paratracheal region and right superior perihilar region. This
could be due to lymphadenopathy and/or post-radiation changes if
the patient has had radiation. Mass-like opacity in the left
suprahilar region measures 49 x 56 mm. Ill-defined faint opacity
in the right upper lobe due to interstitial abnormality could be
secondary to radiation. Other smaller lung nodules are seen in
the lower lobes bilaterally. Left lower lobe retrocardiac
opacity likely represent atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax
or pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the ICU for her upper airway
obstruction.  She was transferred intubated from [**Hospital3 **]
for stent removal.  She underwent flexible bronchoscopy for
airway evaluation on [**9-19**].  This was followed by rigid
bronchoscopy with Y-stent removal for her documented upper
airway obstruction.  She did well after the procedure and was
extubated without difficulty.  She was transferred back to [**Hospital1 **] for further evaluation and treatment.
