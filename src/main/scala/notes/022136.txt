Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**]
Chief Complaint:
Hyperkalemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
71 year old male with CHF (EF 10%), ESRD on HD, who has been
having 3 weeks of malaise, weakness, SOB, and cough. He
presented to [**Hospital1 2177**] ED today with malaise and his K was found to be
6.4. He was given insulin and glucose, and then sent to
outpatient dialysis where his K was 7.0 (? hemolyzed), and it
was thought that he "didn't look right." Outpatient dialysis
reportedly that they did not "feel comfortable dialyzing him",
so he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Last dialysis was Friday. He has had
continued diarrhea which he states is close to his baseline. He
also complains of several months of abdominal pain. His stools
have been intermittently guiaic positive.  Per pt, pain not
worse when eating.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **], pt had EKG with was given insulin, D50, bicarb, and
kayexalate. Nephrology was consulted, and he was admitted for
dialysis. He arrived at the dialysis unit, and then refused
dialysis because he says he wasn't feeling up to it. He was
transfered to the general medical floor where a trigger was
immediately called due to hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoxia.
Temp 94.2 axillary, BP 82/50, pulse 65. RR 20, 99% on RA but
intermittently dropping to 60s.
.
He was last admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] where he gets all of his care on
[**2103-2-18**] for viral gastroenteritis and had a normal abdominal
CT (by report). He says he currently feels OK but has continued
cough, SOB, and abdominal pain. These are the same symptoms he
has been experiencing for the last three weeks. No urinary
symptoms.

.
CXR:  Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is largely
due to cardiomegaly but some pericardial effusion may be
present. Mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality is of uncertain
chronicity and could be edema or chronic change. Pleural
effusion if any is small, and subpulmonic on the right. No
pneumothorax or pathologic widening of the mediastinum is
present. Tips of the dual-channel hemodialysis catheter both
project over the right atrium. No pneumothorax.
.
Echo:
EF 10-20%
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (the basal
inferior/inferolateral wall moves best). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure(PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is moderate global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a
restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
pressure. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is
eccentric and may be underestimated. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. The pulmonic valve leaflets
are thickened. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Severe dilated biventricular cardiomyopathy. No
pericardial
effusion. Elevated left sided filling pressures. Severe
tricuspid
regurgitation.



Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 71 yo m with CHF (EF 10%), ESRD on HD, admitted with
hyperkalemia, transferred to the ICU w/ ? of transient
hypotension and desaturation, with ? PNA.
.
#Hypotension, hypoxia, hypothermia - by report, vital signs
stable on arrival to the ICU without intervention.  Remained
stable on the floor; no evidence of sepsis physiology.
.
#PNA - had ?retrocardiac opacity on CXR, symptomatology as
above.  However no fevers, chills, sweats or leucocytosis.  Anx
not continued on d/c.
.
#ESRD/Hyperkalemia: now resolved after HD.
.
#Lateral tw inversions: now resolved. ? if patient had demand
ischemia in the setting of decompensation.  Serial CE checked;
ruled out for MI.  No complaints of chest pain.
.
#CHF: pt with EF 10% (unknown etiology). Unclear why patient is
not on ASA.
Continued on carvedilol, ACE.  Would consider aggresively
titrating his statin to goal <70 if etiology is ischemic.
.
#? pericaridal effusion- no pulsus on exam and patient
clinically well.  TTE obtained; no sig pericardial effusion.
.
#Abd pain: pt reports several months of intermittent abd pain.
Benign exam; LFTs/[**Doctor First Name **]/Lip.  Further w/u deferred to outpt as pt
tolerated full POs.
