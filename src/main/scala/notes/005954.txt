Chief Complaint:
GI Bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD
Colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 85 y/o M with a PMH of PUD, aflutter, Heart block
s/p PPM, CHF, CRI, AAA with endovascular repair and recent [**Hospital 11091**]
transferred from nuring home with BRBPR and chest pain. Pt had
been on azithromycin and prednisone taper for PNA and COPD
exacerbation. He then developed BRBPR and hypotension with an
initial HCT in ED of 23. OG lavage was negative.
Given history of endovascular repair concern for aorto-enteric
fistula prompted a non-contrast CT which did not show a fistula,
however did demonstrate an existing infrarenal AAA and a high
density intraluminal material within right colon (? blood). GI,
surgery and IR were consulted. The pt. had a negative tagged-RBC
scan. Surgery did not feel there was an acute indication for
surgerical intervention. Pt received 8U PRBCs in total prior to
ICU transfer. The patient was briefly intubated for airway
protection, extubated [**3-7**]. He remained HD stable through MICU
stay and is transferred to the floor with planned colonscopy for
Monday.

[**2110-3-5**] GI BLEEDING STUDY
IMPRESSION:
No GI bleeding noted in the 100 minutes of the study.
.
[**2110-3-6**] CT ABD& PELVIS
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are small bilateral
pleural effusions and dependent atelectasis. Evaluation of the
solid organs is limited without IV contrast. Non-contrast view
of the liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands are unremarkable.
There are a few gallstones but no CT evidence of acute
cholecystitis. Both kidneys are atrophic. Nasogastric tube
terminates in the stomach. There is no free intraperitoneal gas
or fluid. Soft tissue contusion is noted of the subcutaneous
tissues of the left flank. There are atherosclerotic
calcifications of the abdominal aorta and abdominal arteries.
Patient is status post endograft repair of an infrarenal
abdominal aortic aneurysm with graft material extending from
below the takeoff of the renal arteries into both common iliac
arteries. The AAA measures 5.8 AP x 5.5 TV x 7.2 CC cm in size.
No prior studies available to assess change. There is no
retroperitoneal hematoma. High density material within the right
colon may have been ingested but could represent intraluminal
blood given patient history.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter
within the decompressed urinary bladder. There are a few
scattered colonic diverticula but no evidence of acute
diverticulitis. Prostate and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.
A left inguinal hernia contains fat. The appendix is visualized
and is normal in caliber and filled with gas.

BONE WINDOWS: Wedge compression deformity of L3 is age
indeterminate but sclerotic appearance suggests that it is
chronic.

IMPRESSION:
1. Contusion of the subcutaneous soft tissues of the left flank,
but no evidence of rib fracture or intra-abdominal injury.
2. High density intraluminal material within right colon may
have been ingested but could represent blood given patient
history.
3. Status post endograft repair of large infrarenal abdominal
aortic aneurysm which measures 5.8 cm maximal diameter.
4. Simple cholelithiasis.
5. Atrophic appearance of the kidneys.
6. Wedge deformity of L3 is age indeterminate but given
sclerotic appearance is probably chronic.

[**3-10**] EGD
Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
.
[**3-10**] Colonscopy
Edema and friability with contact bleeding were noted in the
splenic flexure at ~45cm. These findings are compatible with
ischemic colitis. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for
histology at the splenic flexure.
Impression: Edema and friability in the splenic flexure at ~45cm
compatible with ischemic colitis (biopsy)
Additional notes: No obvious source of bleeding identified and
no diverticuli seen. Splenic flexure edema likely represents
ischemic colitis. Consider vascular surgery eval

DIAGNOSIS:
Splenic flexure mucosal biopsy:
1.  Ulceration with granulation tissue.
2.  No viral inclusions or tumor
.
[**2110-3-11**] Capsule Endoscopy Report
1. Normal exam up to 3 hr and 20 min of the study, likely when
the capsule was in the mid to distal small bowel.
2. Starting from 3 hr and 20 min until the end of the study at 8
hr, the lumen was filled with blood. The mucosa could not be
visualized due to the blood, and no active bleeding lesion could
be identified. It appeared that the capsule passed into the
colon, but it was unclear when it occurred.
Summary & recommendations:

1. 1. Normal exam up to 3 hr and 20 min of the study, likely
