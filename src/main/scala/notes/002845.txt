History of Present Illness:
75 year right handed woman with a history of "mini strokes on
ASA and Plavix, COPD, whom according to her son [**Name (NI) 122**], was
found by her husband on [**3-30**] some time around 5 pm, in a pool of
blood and vomitus outside her back steps. Mrs [**Known lastname 86767**] had gone
to Twin Rivers Casino, and had been in her usual state of
health, according to both the patient and her son, she was prone
to falls, however, her son mentioned that she was secretive
about her health issues. Her husband heard a thud outside the
back stairs, he was watching TV, he went to see what had
happened about 10 mins later. Initially he thought that it was a
UPS package because his wife got regular deliveries as she shops
on
line, so he did not get there right away. There are two steps to
the back door, she had tripped back and hit the back of her head
(according to the EMS face sheet she had fallen supine). She had
not lost consciousness, but looked dazed and she did not speak
(patient does not remember the event). She was covered in blood
(from her head) and vomit. He called 911 around 5:55 pm. She was
taken to [**Hospital3 3583**]. At the OSH a CT of the Head was
obtained which showed a 1.1cm acute on chronic right SDH with
associated mass effect on the adjacent sulci, and a large right
sided subgaleal hematoma. She was loaded with fosphenytoin,
given Zofran, 6 pack of platelets at the OSH and was sent by
helicopter to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. Upon arrival to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ER she
was awake and alert and did not remember falling. She has also
been transfused with PRBC (stool guaiac has not been done). She
was nauseous and had an episode of emesis in the trauma bay. At
the [**Hospital1 **], left arm twitching (shoulder twitching, spreading down
the arm) was noted by the neurosurgical and trauma ICU teams.

CT C-spine from [**Hospital3 3583**] [**2105-3-30**]: 1. No fracture or
traumatic malalignment involving the cervical spine. 2.
Mild-to-moderate multilevel degenerative change, most severe
from C5 through T1, without critical canal stenosis. 3. Small
osseous fragment well-corticated adjacent to the spinous process
of C7 likely represents sequelae of prior trauma. 4. Enlarged
heterogeneous thyroid should be further evaluated with
ultrasound  non-emergently if not already performed.

CT head [**2105-3-30**]: 1. Unchanged diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage,
small left frontal subdural hematoma, and moderate right
acute-on-chronic subdural hematoma. Persistent mass effect upon
the right cerebral sulci and right lateral ventricle, without
evidence for herniation. 2. Large right parietal subgaleal
hematoma, without underlying fracture.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2105-3-30**]: 1. No evidence of acute visceral
injury in the abdomen or pelvis. 2. Scattered hypodense renal
lesions, too small to characterize. 3. Degenerative changes in
the lumbar spine. 4. Soft tissue contusion/hematoma over the
right gluteal region, incompletely visualized.

CT head [**2105-3-31**]: Slight redistribution but no substantial change
in right
frontoparietal, small left frontal hematoma, and bilateral
diffuse
subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is again no intraventricular
extension and no evidence for increased hematoma or resultant
mass effect. Ventricles remain prominent, though unchanged.

Carotid U/S: [**2105-3-31**]: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA with no
stenosis.

EEG [**2105-4-1**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and

disorganization of the background rhythm suggestive of a mild
encephalopathy. Medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances or
infections
are common causes. No areas of focal slowing, epilepitoform
discharges
or electrographic seizures were seen during this recording.

CT head [**2105-4-1**]: Stable subarachnoid, subdural and
intraventricular hemorrhage as compared to prior study, with no
new hemorrhage.

MRI head [**2105-4-1**]: 1. Unchanged subdural, subarachnoid and
intraventricular hemorrhage with no evidence of new sites of
hemorrhage, mass effect, or infarction. 2. No evidence of
hippocampal/medial temporal sclerosis or focal cortical
dysplasia.
N.B. There is ample post-traumatic injury which could act as
substrate for
seizures (e.g. the subdural hematoma), without invoking an
additional
underlying anatomic abnormality, such as HS or FCD, which would
only rarely present in a 75 year-old.

CT Abd/Pel [**2105-4-1**]: 1. No evidence intra-abdominal or
retroperitoneal hematoma. 2. Previously described right flank
hematoma incompletely visualized - if clinical concern for
expanding right flank hematoma, then rescanning in the wide-bore
CT scanner with dedicated imaging of the entire right flank
would be recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 86767**] was admitted to the Trauma Surgery service
following her fall which resulted in the following injuries:
bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, right acute on chronic
subdural hematoma, right gluteal hematoma, right subgaleal
hematoma, and left small subdural hematoma. She was admitted to
the Trauma Surgical ICU because of these injuries for close
monitoring of her mental status. Her ICU course and remaining
hospitalization can be summarized below by systems.

Neuro: At the OSH, she was loaded with fosphenytoin for seizure
prophylaxis which was switched to dilantin here at [**Hospital1 18**]. She
underwent serial head CTs for intermittent confusion which
showed no significant progression of her bleeds. On [**2105-4-1**], the
patient had two short (approx 1 minute) seizures, thought to be
a Jacksonian [**Month (only) **] by neuro consult who suggested an MRI and
switching to keppra. The patient was transitioned to Keppra po
and had no more seizures. She is being discharged on Keppra and
will follow up with Neurology and Neurosurgery in approximately
one month. During her stay, she experienced some dizziness on
standing which was thought to be related to her anemia. After
her hematocrit improved, so did her dizziness. Should this
continue in the future, CTA of her vertebrobasilar system is
recommended. She will follow up with both neurosurgery and
neurology
