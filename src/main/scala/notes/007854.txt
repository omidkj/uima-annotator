Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
R leg pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R ileofemoral thrombectomy, aorto pelvic arteriogram, R LE 4
compartment fasciotomy/guillitine AKA [**6-7**]
PEG placement
Trach placement
Central line x 2
PICC line
Femoral art line

History of Present Illness:
65yo with h/o AFib, R MCA stroke, CHF (EF 30% 4/06), dementia,
found down in apartment, screaming with R leg pain. Pt. dyspneic
on arrival to ED, Afib with RVR, ABG 7.14/34/319, lactate 7.8,
CK to [**Numeric Identifier 4756**] and LFTs to >1000, and was intubated and started on
CVVHD. He was found to have a clot partially occluding the right
external iliac artery. Pt. underwent emergent R femoral
thrombectomy initially and four compartment fasciotomy.
Subsequently he underwent the same day a right AKA.
Perioperative TEE showed EF 20-25% with thrombus in L atrial
appendage.
His post-op course has been complicated by MRSA bacteremia,
global hypotension requiring pressors, renal failure requiring
CVVH, and mesenteric ischemia with elevated lactates, hct drop
whenever TFs restarted. A CTA abdomen [**6-13**] was done to assess
these changes and found continued ascending colon edema, a
stable clot in the proximal SMA and a suggestion of new wall
edema involving the distal sigmoid colon as well as small bowel
distension. Surgery consulted and feels pt. is not surgical
candidate currently.
.
Pt. has been weaned off of pressors since [**6-16**], and has been
venting well on PS over the past few days. Last fevers [**6-20**] on
current antibiosis ([**Doctor Last Name **], levo, flagyl). ID, renal, thoracics,
urology consults following.
