Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**]
Chief Complaint:
"DOE with dry cough and n/v."

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. CT-guided lung biopsy of the 1.9cm lesion in the RUL.

History of Present Illness:
23 year old homeless female presents to the ED with temp 100.3,
dyspnea on exertion and dry cough.
.
Patient has had intermittent dry cough since [**2194-7-24**].  At
the end of [**Month (only) **] she was treated with azithromycin x 5 days
for an atypical pneumonia.  Patient was subsequently
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2194-10-25**] - [**2194-10-28**] with persistent
cough, nightsweats and chills.  Her CXR showed a RUL infiltrate
which was thought to be an old pneumonia, not treated with any
antibiotics.  Initial concern for active TB, she had two
negative AFB sputums however samples were noted to be
concentrated with upper respiratory secretions.  PPD was
negative.  Follow-up chest film on [**2194-12-4**] showed progression of
lung lesion, now identified as two discrete lung lesions, in
right upper vs lower lobe and lingula.  Differential includes
fungus, mycobacterial and nocardia infection.  Patient was
referred to pulmonary, per phone note from [**2194-12-8**], and
scheduled for a CT chest without contrast tomorrow ([**2194-12-12**]).
Patient complained of worsening chest tightness, sob and
nightsweats.  She was advised to go to the ED if symptoms
persisted.
.
Patient reports Temp to 100.3 several days ago.  She reports
that she had been feeling better until Sunday when she had a
episode of nausea and NB NB vomitting.  She also reports
worsening NS, chills and decreased activity tolerance.  She
reports that she is usually able to go for 15 minute walks
without difficulty.  Now she gets sob with about 5 minutes of
walking.  She says that she had infections fairly frequently in
the past, but unsure of exact duration or location.  She has a
h/o pna at age 12 yo but no other pulmonary issues.  Her ROS is
also positive for vaginal discharge that she feels is from an
untreated BV infection.  She denies CP per say but says she has
occasional parathesias in her chest.  ROS is otherwise negative.

.
Had a negative HIV test in [**Month (only) 359**].  Attempting to relocate to a
new shelter, reports high levels of mold.

Reports:
[**2194-12-11**] CTA Chest: 1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism or
thoracic aortic pathology. 2. Multiple nodules in both lungs,
with suggestion of cavitation in a single nodule. The
differential considerations include multifocal infections, with
etiologies including fungal and Nocardia infection and
malignancy such as lymphoma. Septic emboli is considered
unlikely given the time course of progression. Recommended
biopsy for further evaluation.

[**2194-12-11**] CXR: Three nodules in the right upper lobe and left mid
lung, are
concerning for an infectious process including fungal and
nocardia infection.  Malignancy is also in the differential.
Please refer to the CT chest performed on the same day for
further evaluation.

Biopsy results from Right lung lesion:
Lung nodule, needle core biopsy:
Pulmonary parenchyma with non-necrotizing granulomatous
inflammation, see note.
Note: AFB and GMS (fungal) stains are negative for organisms.
No polarizable material seen. The differential diagnosis
includes an infectious process and other causes of granulomatous
lung disease (sarcoidosis, etc...).
.
Cytology of right lung lesion:
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Bronchial cells, abundant macrophages, and structures
suggestive of granulomas.
.
[**12-12**] TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
