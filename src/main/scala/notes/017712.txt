Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypothermia, hypotension, lactic acidosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, femoral CVL, femoral arterial line

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 70 year old female with past medical history of
coronary artery disease, hypertension, CVA, and breast cancer
who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-16**]. Per report from
the emergency room physicians, her daughter went to visit the
patient today and noted the patient was cold, breathing fast,
and felt unwell. EMS was called, and upon arrival the patient
was noted to be tachypneic with a respiratory rate to the 40's,
cold, sweaty, and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 70/palp.
EMS was unable to obtain a temperature or start an IV in the
field.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient was noted to be tachypneic,
and was placed on a non-rebreather. The ED staff had a difficult
time obtaining a blood pressure (erratic and felt to be
erroneous readings of 190's obtained), and ultimately a mannual
cuff provided [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1131**] of systolic of 85. Again it was
difficult to place a peripheral IV, so a left EJ was placed.
Ultimately a femoral central line was placed, as with her
persistent tachypnea a neck line was felt unsafe. Her breathing
improved to a rate in the 20's, and she was placed on nasal
cannula oxygen with a saturation in the 90's. She received three
liters of intravenous fluid. A chest x-ray was felt to possibly
be consistent with pneumonia, so she was given levofloxacin,
zosyn, and vancomycin to cover for possible aspiration and
hospital-acquired pathogens given her recent stay. Of note, she
remained hypothermic and a rectal probe was unable to read a
temperature. With warm blankets, her temperature improved to 92
rectally at time of transfer. Her labs were notable for a
lactate of 9.5, troponin at her baseline (0.06), and a bump in
her creatinine to 2.3 (previously 1.4).
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient denies any discomfort or
pain, but states she feels cold. She cannot provide any details
regarding the events leading to hospitalization.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 70 year old female with past medical history of
breast cancer, coronary artery disease, stroke, and hypertension
who presents with hypothermia, hypotension, and elevated lactic
acid. Pt was admitted to the MICU for continued resuscitation.
.
#) Hypothermia: Unclear etiology. Differential includes sepsis,
environmental, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, secondary
to toxic/metabolic etiology (leading to inability to seek
warmth) among other possibilities. Likely contributing to lactic
acidosis. Most likely is volume depletion +/- sepsis.
- Bair-hugger to raise core temperature
- Infectious work-up as discussed below including blood, urine,
sputum cultures.
- AM cortisol and TSH, if cortisol abnormal will consider
cortisone stress
.
#) Hypotension: Patient noted to be hypotensive with systolic to
80's, s
