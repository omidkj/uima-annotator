ECHO:The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal.  Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2135-7-18**],
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower and
mitral regurgitation is now less prominent.

CXR: No significant interval change in bibasilar opacities with
bilateral (right greater than left) pleural effusions

RENAL U/S:. The right and left kidneys measure 9.7 and 11.6 cm,
respectively. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. No renal
stones or masses are visualized.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2135-12-13**] 3:56 PM
1. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
2. Small perihepatic fluid without locualted fluid collection or
associated free air.
3. Slightly dilated loops of small bowel without identifiable
transition point.
4. Anasarca.
5. Multiple compression fractures.

Brief Hospital Course:
85M MDS/CMML with colon cancer, status post resection
complicated by ileotomy requiring ileostomy placement, here for
cholecystectomy (for cholecystitis) and ileostomy takedown.

Patient presented with abdominal pain and had radiological
findings consistent with cholecystitis.  Therefore, as patient
was scheduled to undergo ileostomy takedown within the week of
presentation, patient underwent both cholecystectomy and
ileostomy takedown on hospital day 4.  Patient initially
tolerated the procedure well, however post-operative course was
complicated by hypotension requiring transfer to the surgical
ICU.  Patient was stabilized on pressors and a Swan Ganz
catheter was placed.  Patient was found to have bilateral
pulmonary consolidations with sputum notable for methicillin
resistant staphylococcus aureus and klebisiella, therefore,
vancomycin and meropenem were administered for treatment based
upon susceptibility profiles.  Subsequently, patient went into
acute renal failure, felt to be secondary to episode of
hypotension - medications were adjusted for renal dosing.
Patient was stabilized and transferred from the SICU to internal
medicine service on hospital day 15.

* Cholecystectomy/Ileostomy takedown: Post-operative course was
complicated as above, however, surgical wound responded
appropriately to [**Hospital1 **] wet-to-dry dressing changes with healing by
secondary intention.  Of note, at one point during post-op
course, wound was thought to be draining purulent material,
however, this was self-limited, and at the time of discharge,
patient's wound had development of excellent granulation tissue
and no evidence of infection.  Staples were removed by surgical
consultants without complications.

* Pneumonia: As noted above, sputum culture returned MRSA and
klebsiella, and patiented was started on a course of
vancomycin/meropenem, to continue until [**2135-12-20**].  On hospital
day 17, patient was noted to have a white count elevation to 60,
which prompted an infectious workup, although patient had no
clinical signs or symptoms of infection or fever.  CT scan
revealed no abdominal pathology, however, patient was noted to
have large pleural effusions bilaterally, right greater than
left, consistent with patient's subjective complaints of
dyspnea.

On hospital day 18, patient underwent thoracentesis of the right
pleural space, removing 2 liters of serosanguinous fluid
(negative for bacterial growth and few neutrophils).  Right lung
expanded appropriately, although patient continued to remain
intermittently dyspneic, thought to be due to conti
