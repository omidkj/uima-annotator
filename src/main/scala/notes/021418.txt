Chief Complaint:
altered mental status


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
84F h/o COPD, DM-2, HTN, CVA (details unknown), hyperlipidemia,
CAD, depression, CHF, PVD presents with altered mental status
and fever from [**Hospital3 537**] nursing home. Grand-daughter states
that four days prior to admission, Ms. [**Known lastname **] became confused and
slow to answer. The patient is usually oriented and able to
carry out a normal conversation. Her Tm at [**Hospital3 **] was
102.5. This morning her grand daughter states that the patient
was much less responsive than days earlier. She may have had a
right facial droop this morning, but she was slouched to her
right side in bed and the grand daughter was not sure. Her
oxygen saturations dropped to the 80s and this incited a
hospital transfer.
.
In the ED, initial VS were unrecorded in triage presumably due
to the need for immediate bipap. T 104.6, HR 84, BP 89/47, RR 19
Sat 100 ?CPAP. FS 444. Recieved levofloaxacin 500mg iv,
vancomycin 1g iv, ctx 1g iv (had gotten another gram at NH). A
CXR showed left base opacity c/f atelectasis (cannot rule out
infiltrate). CT head showed small hyperdensity in left thalamus
c/w hemorrhage/cavernoma/cancer. Due to this finding, an LP was
not done. Neurosurgical c/s revealed no surgical interventions.
Vitals upon transfer to MICU were vitals 101, 112/46, 73, rr 23,
100%.
.
OSH record review shows CXR [**2105-1-15**] showing no acute pathology,
EKG with SR 79 w/ nonspecific st/t changes. UA with trace
glucose, negative ketones, 1+ protein.  K 3.8, CO2 38, BUN 41,
Cr 0.9, Na 155, glucose 307, Ca 9.3, WBC 12.7, Hct 45.2, Plt
237. On [**2105-12-18**] labs indicated wbc 9.5, Na 141, K 4.5, Cl 95,
CO2 40, Cr 0.5, BUN 16, glucose 117, Ca 9.0, Cholesterol 164,
HDL 50, LDL 71, Hgb A1C 7.1.
.
On arrival to the MICU, BiPAP mask taken off and she was put on
high flow face mask w/ 80% oxygen/15L which took her saturation
from 88 to 100% over several minutes. She was non-verbal. She
nodded appropriately.

Brief Hospital Course:
 84F h/o COPD, DM-2, HTN, CVA (details unknown), hyperlipidemia,
CAD, depression, CHF, PVD presents with altered mental status
and fever from [**Hospital3 537**] nursing home.
.
# toxic metabolic encephalopathy:  The patient's altered mental
status was attributed to toxic-metabolic encephaolpathy in the
setting of sepsis, although additional concerns included new
stroke, bacterial or viral meningitis, or hypercarbia.  The
patient was initially started on empiric antibiotic treatment
for possible meningitis.  A CT head was done showing a
hyperattenuating focus involving the left thalamus, that could
represent parenchymal hemorrahage vs. neoplam.  There was also
evidence of small vessel ischemic diease and multiple remote
infarctions.  Neurosurgey evaluated the patient and it was
decided that no surgical intervention was indicated at the time.
The patient's mental status did not improve during the
hospitalization, and a family meeting with the grand-daughter
(HCP) was held, and the patient's focus of care was CMO.
.
With the assistance of Palliative Care consult team, pt was
transfered to the the general medicine floor, continued on
morphine and prn lorazepam for comfort.  She quietly expired
during the evening, and, as per her grand daughter's request, an
autopsy will be done.
.
# Dyspnea/respiratory status: The patient has a history of COPD
with 100 pack year history; possible that this is related to
COPD exacerbation; other differentials include pneumonia versus
CHF exacerbation.  CXR with evidence of possible L basilar
infiltrate versus atelectasis.   The patient was on antibiotic
coverage initially, however, after she was made CMO, as
antibiotics were discontinued.
.
On transfer to the general medicine floor, the patient was on
nebs for comfort and breathing comfortably on nasal cannula.
She passed during the night.
.
# Fevers: The etiology of the patient's fevers has broad
differential, including pneumonia, UTI, or meningitis.  The
patient was initially on broad spectrum abx, but since being
made CMO, all abx have been d/ced and her vitals were no longer
being checked.
.
# Hyperattenuating lesion in L thalamus: Possibly hemorrhagic
stroke versus neoplasm.  Neurosurg was following patient, and
decided that there was no need for surgical intervention at this
time.  Possible that this lesion could have explained the
patient's acute change in altered mental status, as well.
.
# COPD:  The patient had oxygen requirement during this
hospitalization, which could have represented COPD excacerbation
versus underlying pneumonia.  The patient was initially on
antibiotics; however, these were later discontinued when she was
made CMO. Nebulizers were continued for patient comfort.
.
Chronic Issues:
# HTN/hyperlipidemia:  The patient was initially continued on
her home anti-hypertensives and hyperlipidemia medications.
However, as she was made CMO, these home medications were held.

.
#depression/dementia:  The patient's home medications were also
held when she was made CMO.
