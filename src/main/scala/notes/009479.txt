Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 63 year old male with PMH significant for CAD s/p 4
vessel CABG in [**2158**], s/p PCI with DES to occluded graft
(SVG->PDA) in [**2174-4-18**], s/p recent admission for NSTEMI [**7-28**]
that was medically managed, and now presenting with hypotension
to SBPs of 70 in the setting of starting spironolactone and
isosorbide last week.
.
#. Hypotension. The patient was found to be hypotensive with a
systolic in the 70s in pulmonary clinic in the setting of
recently being started on sprironolactone and isosorbide.  He
Since being started on these meds he has noted that he has had
symptoms of lightheadedness and dizziness at home especially
when he stood up laying down or sitting.  On admission to the
ICU, the team considered several etiologies for the patient's
hypotension, including infectious, cardiogenic,
medication-effect.  There were no changes on EKG, and the
patient's CE were negative x1.  There were no focal signs on
physical exam or laboratory values to suggest infection.
Digoxin level was wnl.  Antihypertensives were initially held
with improvement in symptoms.  Overnight the patient remained
stable with SBPs rising to the 140s. The patient was transfered
to the floors, where he remained stable with SBPs in the
130s-140s.  The patient was started on half-doses of his
lisinopril (20mg daily) and carvedilol (12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]).  He
remained stable overnight with SBPs in the 120s-130s.  The
patient was restarted on a reduced dosing of his lasix (40mg
daily) that morning.  With stable SBPs in the 120s-130s, the
patient was discharged with a presciption of a blood pressure
cuff and instructions to take his blood pressure every morning
and to call his PCP if his pressures were <100 or >170.  The
patient reported he had follow-up scheduled with his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
[**9-26**].  His PCP's office was verbally alerted regarding
circumstances of this admission to ensure proper follow-up
occurred.
.
#. [**Last Name (un) **]. The patient was admitted with a Cr of 1.5.  It was
thought that this was likely prerenal in the setting of diuresis
with furosemide and newly started spironolactone.  His
creatinine resolved to baseline 1.0 with IV and PO rehydration.
.
#. Persistent lung infiltrate. Patient is awaiting biopsy to
rule out bronchoalveolar carcinoma.  He was instructed to
discuss rescheduling a biospy with his primary care doctor.
.
#. CAD. Patient is s/p CABG in [**2158**] with recent PCI for [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**] to occluded graft in [**4-26**] as well as NSTEMI managed
medically in [**7-28**]. Dixogin, Lipitor, and ASA continued.  As
discussed above, beta blocker and ACEI were initially held, then
restarted at decreased dosages.  His spironolactone and
isosorbide were held at discharge pending further discussion
with his PCP and cardiologist.

#COPD: The patient was continued on his home regimen of
fluticasone-salmeterol, tiotropium, and albuterol as needed.
.
#HLD: The patient was continued on home Atorvastatin.
.
#OSA: The patient was continued on his home CPAP regimen w/o
issue.
.
The patient remained full code for the duration of this
admission
