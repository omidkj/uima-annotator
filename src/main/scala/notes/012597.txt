Allergies:
Penicillins / Plavix

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain & Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 86 year old male with a history of myocardial
infarction, CHF, and ICD placed for NSVT, and recently diagnosed
metastatic small cell lung cancer presented with weakness, chest
pain and dyspnea.  He was discharged from the hospital yesterday
for chest pain that was believed to be due to metastatic disease
to his chest wall.  PE was also considered but CT-A could not be
completed secondary to renal failure and V/Q was not completed
due to underlying disease secondary to his malignancy.  He was
not anticoagulated secondary to risk for brain metastases.  He
was seen by his VNA today who noticed hypotension with BP 80s/P.
 EMS was called and reported O2 sat 70's this am along with
hemoptysis seen in his home.  Patient feels he was discharged
premature.  DNR/DNI.

Vitals in ED: 96.7 121 91/50 24 86% 4L NC.  CXR showed ? LLL
pneumonia and also could not rule out pneumobili.  Left lateral
decubitus final read pending.  He was given Vancomycin and
Cefepime.  He has been persistently hypotensive 83/38, 79/37,
89/36 despite 3L IVF given today.  EKG: NSR 1st deg AV block,
occasional ectopy, no ischemia.  Vitals now: 91/52 84 96 on 4L.

Right upper lobe lung mass with SCLC diagnosed [**2116-6-21**] with
uptake on PET in pulmonary nodules, mediastinal, hilar, and
contralateral supraclavicular lymph nodes, liver metastases,
deposits in the retroperitoneum and anterior abdominal wall, and

IMAGING
=============
[**2116-10-12**]
- CXR: Upright portable AP view of the chest is obtained.
Dual-lead AICD device is again noted with lead tips extending
into the right atrium and right ventricle. There is slight
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with lucency below the
right hemidiaphragm, which could reflect air-filled bowel below
the right hemidiaphragm, though pneumoperitoneum cannot be
excluded. There is relative increased opacity at the left lung
base, which could reflect atelectasis versus pneumonia. The
known masses in the right perihilar and upper lobe are
suboptimally assessed. No pneumothorax is present. Heart size
appears grossly stable. Atherosclerotic calcifications along the
thoracic aorta are noted. Bony structures appear demineralized.
IMPRESSION:
1. Lucency below the right hemidiaphragm could reflect
air-filled large bowel, though pneumoperitoneum cannot be
excluded. Please correlate clinically and with left lateral
decubitus views of the abdomen to further assess as indicated.
2. Increased opacity at the left lung base could represent
atelectasis versus pneumonia. Known right-sided lung masses are
poorly visualized.

- CXR (lateral decubitus):
Single left lateral decubitus view of the chest was provided.
There is no definite sign of free air below the right
hemidiaphragm. Right lung remains clear.
IMPRESSION: No definite signs of free air below the right
hemidiaphragm.

- CT Head: There is no hemorrhage or major acute vascular
territorial
infarction. There is no edema, mass effect or shift of normally
midline
structures. The ventricles and sulci are prominent in size and
configuration, likely due to age-related global atrophy.
Extensive periventricular white matter hypodensities are likely
due to chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  Bilateral
calcified atherosclerosis are noted in the carotid siphons. The
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
BONE WINDOWS: There is no concerning lesion for metastatic
disease.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial abnormality. In the setting of
continued clinical concern, MRI is more sensitive for metastatic
disease evaluation.

[**2116-10-13**]
- Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets ar
