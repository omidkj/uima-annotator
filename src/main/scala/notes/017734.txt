Brief Hospital Course:
84 y.o. F with h/o falls, atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
chronic kidney disease, HTN, and T2 DM, who presents s/p
mechanical fall day prior to admission, incidentally found to
have worsening anemia with guiaic + stools in setting of
supratherapeutic INR.

1. GIB: Given negative NG lavage, guiaic positive reddish brown
stools on rectal, likely lower GI bleed; however, may also be
oozing from upper GI tract given supratherapeutic INR of 4.3.
Hemodynamically stable in ED. Pt received vitamin K IV 10 mg x 1
in ED. Patient received a total of 3U PRBC's. Hct remained
stable for >48 hours in the high 24's by the time of discharge.
No gross bleeding was seen after admission, no worrisome changes
in vitals signs. On [**2138-11-17**] the pt went for EGD/colonoscopy
which showed diverticuloses in colon and two polyps which were
removed with pathology as above. The prep was considered limited
and GI recommended a repeat colonoscopy for further evaluation
as well as a capsule endoscopy to evaluate the small bowel in
the near future. These procedures were deferred to the outpt
setting, and will need to be followed up on by the pt's PCP.

2. S/p mechanical fall--Pt had plain films showing no fracture.
She did have large effusions on the medial aspect of her
chronically arthritic knees. Pain was only an occasional
complaint during admission and was relieved with small amts of
narcotics, lidocaine patches, and Tylenol. Physical therapy came
to work with her both while she was in the unit, at which time
they cleared her for home with PT services, and also while she
on the floor, at which time they recommended the same. The pt
was seen to be ambulating the halls with a walker and able to
climb stairs without difficulty.

3. HTN--All HTN meds were held on admission. Subsequently
Propanolol and Valsartan were added back. However, other bp meds
Lasix, Hydralazine, and Nifedipine continued to be held and this
will need to be addressed by PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was ranging between
120-150 on the day of discharge.

4. Type 2 DM: Pt was seen to have 2 episodes of symptomatic
hypoglycemia which resolved with juice and crackers. Her insulin
regimen was made less aggressive on admission to the floor with
an regimen of NPH [**12-2**] in the am/pm and sliding scale insulin
as well. She felt that she was not eating as much as she does at
home. After this change she did not have any more episodes of
hypoglycemia. On discharge, we lowered her home regimen of
Humalog 75/25 from its original dose of 25/40 in the am/pm to a
lower dose of 15/30 in the am/pm. She stated she checks her
finger sticks often and would continue to do so until follow up.
This is another aspect of her care that will need to be followed
in the outpt setting.

5. [**Name (NI) 100757**] pt was maintained on Digoxin. A level was measured
at 0.8. Rate was also controlled with Propanolol which was added
back when her Hct was stable and it was clear she was not
bleeding. The patient had excellent heart rate control and no
episodes of RVR while admitted.

The pt's Coumadin was also held in the setting of active
bleeding, and was not restarted while admitted. Her INR was 4.3
on admission and 1.2 by discharge. This is another issue that
will need to be addressed by pt's PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has a high risk for
stroke according to CHADS2 and will likely need to be restarted,
however as was discussed, she also has a h/o falls. Therefore
risks/benefits will need to be weighed when restarting
anticoagulation. Currently the risks of a recurrent GIB and fall
appear to outweight the risk of stroke. This was discussed with
the patient and the patient agreed with the management.

6. [**Name (NI) 94062**] pt was seen to be chronically anemic, with a
picture consistent with anemia of chronic disease and was given
a dose of erythropoietin on the advice of her nephrologist. She
was NOT given a prescription for this on discharge and this will
need to be followed up, likely by her nephrologist or PCP.

7. Acute on Chronic Renal [**Name (NI) 94059**] pt's Cr on transfer from
the ICU was within limits of her baseline and by
