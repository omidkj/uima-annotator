Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, tracheostomy, peg tube placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 74 yo F with ? history of seizure who was sleeping
the night of admission when her husband awoke and found her to
be son[**Name (NI) 7884**] and AMS.  He was reportedly concerned about seizure
and called EMS.   EMS found her to be in respiratory failure,
attempted intubation in field but failed.  Went to [**Location (un) **] ED.
At [**Location (un) **] ED, she was intubated and a CT head negative and
found to have a UTI.  Recieved 1g Ceftriaxone.  Transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] with continued AMS and concern of CT negative stroke vs
post-ictal state.  Intially started on Esmolol gtt for
hypertension to 180s.  CXR obtained with wide medistinum.  Given
failed intubation in field, obtained CTA that revealed a Type A
dissection, goes to descending aorta, does not extend into
coranaries.  Stops at R innominate arterty.  With Esmolol gtt,
SBP decreased from 180 to 140.  Thoracic surgery wanted MR head
to assess for further etiology of neurological changes.  MRI
revealed two small strokes.  Given versed and then propofol
throughout the day, so medication effect suspected as playing a
role in continued AMS. Neurology was consulted and recommended
further evaluatoin with an EED.  Her exam was non-focal. Her
labs are remarkable for a leukocytosis and left shift with a
lactate of 3.0 now.   Her labs are remarkable for a leukocytosis
and left shift with a lactate of 3.0.  Given question of
underlying neurological status, CT surgery was hesistant to
pursue emergent repair.   Thus, she was admitted to the MICU for
further monitoring and care.  Upon arrival, patient is minimally
responsive to sternal rub and cannot answer questions further.
Husband confirms story as above and states understanding about
both her strokes and aortic dissection.

.
CT Chest [**2105-9-17**]: Type-A aortic dissection with extensive
intramural hematoma involving the proximal aspects of all the
great vessels and the aortic arch. Dissection does not involve
the origins of the coronary arteries. Focal stenosis of the left
subclavian vein at the level of the first rib with multiple
chest wall venous collaterals.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate
position. Stable appearance of L4-L5 vertebral fusion hardware
and bilateral femoral hip arthroplasty.
.
MRI Brain [**2105-9-17**]: Multifocal acute infarcts, the largest
located within the right caudate head with partial involvement
of the right basal ganglia. The multifocality suggests the
central embolic source. Only the distal left vertebral artery is
visualized, which may fill by retrograde flow. The proximal left
vertebral artery may be hypoplastic or occluded.
.
EEG [**2105-9-18**]: Abnormal EEG due to the slow background. These
findings
suggest a mild encephalopathy affecting both cortical and
subcortical
structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection
are
among the most common causes. There were no clearly epileptiform

features.
.
Echo [**2105-9-18**]: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. There is a 2 cm intramural hematoma
in the posterior aortic root at the level of left and
noncoronary sinuses of Valsalva, with a contiguous dissection
flap extending into the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva all the
way to the aortic valve. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28263**] was admitted to the MICU with a type A aortic
dissection and acute CVAs.  She was intubated and initially
placed on an esmolol drip to control blood pressures to
systolics 100-120.  This was stopped and she had an episode of
atrial fibrillation with RVR.  She was given diltiazem to
control this but became hypotensive and this was switched to
metoprolol.  She had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
 Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted regarding her type A
aortic dissection and felt that she was not a surgical candidate
due to her mental status changes.  Neurology was consulted as
well to manage her acute infarcts.  She was started on a heparin
drip for management of her embolic disease and also for a right
upper extremity DVT.  She was extubated briefly and then
reintubated for increased oxygen requirements.  She had an LP on
[**2105-9-22**] which did not show evidence of infection.  She had a
thoracentesis on [**2105-10-1**] showing an exudative effusion.  She
continued to be febrile and grew MRSA in her sputum and was
treated with Vancomycin X 14 days.  She was unable to be weaned
from the ventilator and had a tracheostomy and PEG tube placed
on [**2105-10-9**].  She had persistently labile blood pressures with
episodes of hypotension alternating with hypertension.  On
[**2105-10-9**], CT surgery stated again that she was not a surgical
candidate.  On [**2105-10-13**], she suffered a PEA arrest and was not
able to be resuscitated.  An echo done during the code showed
cardiac tamponade and RV collapse, a known complication of
aortic dissection.
