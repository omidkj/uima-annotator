History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Last Name (un) 44309**] is a 47 year old right handed female with
history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] s/p a MG crises in [**2190**] and [**2194**]
who
now presents with dry cough, fatigue, SOB, and weakness in the
last 24 hours.  2 days ago she states that she began having a
sore throat and cough.  He son and grandson had been sick with
bronchitis.  She used her nebulizer and that seemed to help.
However the following day (yesterday) she woke up in the morning
and felt short of breath.  She used her nebulizer and took 2
showers, but her symptoms continued.  She denies any difficulty
swallowing or pharyngeal weakness but states that she has become
quite hoarse with a nasal sounding voice.  She denies any
diplopia, orthopnea.  She has felt overall fatigued but no focal
weakness.

She was diagnosed in [**2187**] with MG at [**Hospital1 2025**], and currently follows
with her Neurologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital3 15054**].   She was ACh R Ab
+
and was found to have thymoma undering going a thimectomy.  She
has had 2 exacerbations of her MG. The first in [**2190**] requiring
intubation which was complicated by post intubation tracheal
stenosis 6 months later.  She is s/p stent placement and stent
removal ([**2193-3-21**]).  She had another event in [**2194**] requiring
admission which improved on steroids and imuran.   She has never
received IVIG or Plasmapheresis.

She has been doing well since the admission in [**2194**].  She has
stopped taking the mestinon and has been self titrating doses of
prednisone.  Currently she is taking 10 mg and 5 mg on
alternating days.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Last Name (un) 44309**] is a 47 year old right handed female with
history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] s/p a MG crises in [**2190**] and [**2194**]
who
now presents with with dry cough, fatigue, SOB, and weakness in
the last 24 hours.  She is s/p tracheal stent placement and
stent
removal ([**2193-3-21**]).  She states that she began having a sore
throat and cough 2 days ago, which has now improved.  However,
woke up yesterday morning with profound shortness of breath.
Her
exam is remarkable for a HR of 110 bpm, pOx of 91% on RA, and
96%
on 4L, not using accessory respiratory muscles, no paradoxical
abdominal breathing.  No fatiguable weakness, diplopia, or
ptosis.  She counts up to 35 on 1 breath.  She has a
nasal/hoarse
voice which is characteristic of her exacerbations.   Her NIF is
-70 and a Vc of 2.95L.  BNP, d-dimer, and CXR were normal.  She
was afebrile. However, she does have fingerstick glucose of 375
and a HCO3 of 21, which may reflect some acidosis secondary to
an
undiagnosed diabetes.   However, there is high concern these
symtpoms reflect a new MG crisis in the setting of her recent
URI.
The patient was admitted to the NEURO ICU for observation. She
was treated with IVF and monitored with serial NIF/VC, and
remained stable. She was continued on her home doses of Imuran
and prednisone. She likely had a mild viral upper respiratory
illness, which transiently exacerbated her myasthenia symptoms.
She was improving by hospital day 2, and transferred to the
floor. She continued to gradually improve and was
symptomatically back to baseline prior to discharge.

She wanted to transfer her neurology care to [**Hospital1 18**], and this was
arranged. It should be considered whether the patient should be
switched from Imuran to Cellcept as an outpatient.
She also had a Grade II thymoma resected in the past and she was
scheduled for an outpatient chest CT to evalute for recurrence.

[**Last Name (un) **] diabetes service was consulted for hyperglycemia and
elevated HbA1c. They recommended Lantus 14 U QHS and Humalog
sliding scale, as well as metformin. They will set up the
patient for follow up at [**Last Name (un) **].
