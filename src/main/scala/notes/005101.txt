Admission Date:  [**2143-1-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2143-1-30**]

Date of Birth:   [**2070-5-9**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CA [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 -year-old female
with a history of coronary artery bypass graft and mitral
valve replacement in [**2135**] for coronary artery disease and
mitral insufficiency who presented to her primary MD's office
on [**12-31**] with increasing shortness of breath times two
months.  She was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation and
admitted to an outside hospital.  She was rate controlled
with Cardizem and converted spontaneously to normal sinus
rhythm.  The patient underwent echocardiogram which showed an
ejection fraction of 25% and severe aortic stenosis.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization showed 90% occlusion of
distal right coronary artery with vein grafts patent as well
as severe aortic stenosis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2135**],
mitral stenosis status post mitral valve replacement in [**2135**],
history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes,
status post cholecystectomy, and a compression fracture at
T11.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol 50 mg twice a day,
Lisinopril 5.0 mg a day, Lasix 40 mg a day, Digoxin 0.125 mg
a day, Prilosec 20 mg twice a day.

ALLERGIES:  Bactrim.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs: temperature
of 100.4 F; pulse 87; blood pressure 122/70; saturating 97%
on room air.  She is a pleasant, elderly white female in no
acute distress.  She had jugular venous distention to 10 cm.
Lungs had bibasilar crackles, no consolidation.  Heart:
regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI systolic murmur across
the entire precordium.  Abdomen was soft, nontender.
Extremities: trace bilateral lower extremity edema, distal
pulses were 1+ bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for scheduled aortic valve
replacement, possible coronary artery bypass graft, redo
coronary artery bypass graft; however, her preoperative
course was complicated by fevers of unknown origin.  The
patient underwent an extensive work up and was subsequently
transferred to Medicine service for that work up.  After,
again, multiple diagnostic procedures including CT scans of
the abdomen and chest, ERCP, upper endoscopy, and
transesophageal echocardiogram.  After this extensive work
up, including multiple pansensitive cultures, nothing became
apparent as to what was causing her fevers and the
Infectious Disease team and the Gastrointestinal team became
involved.

Once the patient became afebrile and with the negative work
up, the patient was finally brought to the Operating Room for
aortic valve repair and replacement and coronary artery
bypass graft times one, performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13624**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10102**], on
[**2143-1-22**].  The patient received a 21 mm bioprosthetic valve
and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
complications.

She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
hemodynamic monitoring.  The patient was extubated without
difficulty and her immediate postoperative course was
complicated by episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation, atrial
flutter.  However, this became rate controlled when the
patient showed evidence of heart block.  Electrophysiology
team was consulted and the plan was to put a pacemaker in.
However, the patient's heart block resolved.  She continued
to have problems with rapid supraventricular rhythm.  She was
eventually rate controlled with po Lopressor and Cardizem
with a satisfactory rate in the 60's to 80's.

The patient was anticoagulated for her previously repaired
mitral valve which was a mechanical valve.  Her INR slowly
climbed to a therapeutic level before discharge.  She
remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile throughout her
postoperative course.  She was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day two in stable condition.  Chest tubes,
pacing wires, central venous line, and Foley catheter were
removed without incident.

Physical Therapy worked with the patient and felt that she
was a suitable candidate for a short term rehabilitation
facility.  [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes service was consulted for optimal
management of her blood sugars.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged on [**2143-1-30**] to a
rehabilitation facility in stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post redo coronary artery
bypass graft times one.
2.  Severe aortic stenosis, status post aortic valve
replacement with bioprosthetic valve.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Include Levaquin 500 mg po q day
times three days for urinary tract infection, Lopressor 100
mg po bid, Coumadin 2.5 mg po q day, Lasix 40 mg po bid,
Cardizem 30 mg po q six hours, repaglinide 5.0 mg po tid with
meals, potassium chloride 40 mEq po bid, Colace 100 mg po
bid, Percocet one to two tablets po q four to six hours prn,
Captopril 25 mg po q eight hours, Xanax 0.75 mg po q AM, 0.25
mg po q HS, as well as a sliding scale regular insulin.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged on [**2143-1-30**] to
rehabilitation in stable condition.
