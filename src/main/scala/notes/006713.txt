HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old male with
a past medical history significant for lung adenocarcinoma
status post recent right upper lobectomy and right middle
lobe wedge resection on [**2142-12-18**].  The [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course was complicated by right upper lobe
pneumothorax treated with chest tube placement and subsequent
right lower lobe collapse, now status post pleurodesis.  The
patient was discharged on [**12-27**], to home.  The patient's
other medical history is significant for chronic atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, Hepatitis C and prostate cancer.  The
patient awoke on the morning of [**1-4**], with acute onset
of shortness of breath, tachypnea, palpitations and worsening
weakness.  He also reported right sided pleuritic chest pain
and cough with reddish sputum.  The patient presented to
outside hospital where he was hypoxic, hypotensive and in
rapid atrial fibrillation.  At the outside hospital the
patient was given a Diltiazem drip, intravenous fluids, and
then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].

In the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 188**], the patient was noted to be anemic and have an
elevated INR to 4.8.  He was tachycardic to the 140s.  Chest
x-ray revealed reticular nodule pattern on the left and a CT
scan angiogram revealed left-sided pulmonary emboli.  The
patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

On review of systems, the patient reported dyspnea, bilateral
lower extremity edema, weakness and poor appetite.  He denied
chest pain except for the pleuritic chest pain described
above, fevers, chills or melena.  There was no nausea or
vomiting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Adeno lung cancer status post right upper lobe resection;
status post right middle lobe wedge resection; status post
pneumothorax and status post right sided collapse and
subsequent pleurodesis.
2.  Hepatitis C.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  Prostate cancer.
7.  Ejection fraction of approximately 40% and history of
negative P-thallium in [**2142-6-3**].

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Cardizem.
2.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Coumadin, unknown dose.
5.  Percocet p.r.n.
6.  Albuterol MDI.
7.  Atrovent MDI.
8.  Azmacort.
9.  Iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. three times a day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  He has a 52 year
pack year smoking history and drinks appropriate two drinks a
day.  The patient is full code.

ALLERGIES:   The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, blood pressure 70/58,
pulse of 120; oxygen saturation is 85% on two liters.  In
general, he is a cachectic male, conversive in mild
respiratory distress.  HEENT:  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  Oropharynx is dry.  Mucous membranes were dry.  Neck
was supple with no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, irregular, with a distant S1,
S2.  Respiratory:  Right side with crackles below the surgery
site.  Distant breath sounds on the left.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities with bilateral lower extremity edema, left
greater than right.  Left toes with arterial insufficiency
changes.  Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.
Neurologic examination nonfocal.

LABORATORY:  Data on admission, white blood cell count of
18.6, hematocrit of 27.6 with a baseline of approximately 32,
platelets 359.  Sodium was 134, potassium 4.8, chloride 98,
bicarbonate 25, BUN 34, creatinine 1.5, glucose 102.

An arterial blood gas done on 40% FIO2 was 7.42/33/70, the
lactate was 1.7.  Coagulation studies were significant for an
INR of 4.4.

Chest x-ray showed moderate cardiomegaly, right upper
pneumothorax unchanged, and some fluid within the resection
cavity.  Increased opacity was also seen throughout the right
hemithorax.  CT angiogram showed multiple filling defects in
the left main and smaller arteries.  It also demonstrated
emphysema in the left upper and left lower lobe as well as
reticular opacities in the right lower lobe consistent with
infection of lymphangitic spread.

MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary embolus:  The patient was heparinized.  He had
an IVC filter placed on [**1-5**].  He had lower extremity
non-invasive studies done on [**1-10**], which showed deep
venous thrombosis in the popliteal vein and in the calf veins
on the left.  The patient was restarted on Coumadin and his
INR was therapeutic by the time of transfer to the Medical
Floor.  The patient continued to have oxygen requirement of
40 to 50% by face mask.

2.  Rapid atrial fibrillation:  This was initially caused by
his Diltiazem drip plus/minus an Esmolol drip.  Eventually,
the patient was transitioned to Cardizem and Lopressor.
Digoxin was used transiently but was subsequently
discontinued.  The patient was anti-coagulated as above.

3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient was
treated with a steroid taper as well as his Serevent,
Flovent, Atrovent and Albuterol inhalers.

4.  Pneumonia:  The patient was treated with Vancomycin for
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum and
Levofloxacin for Klebsiella in his sputum.

The patient was called out to the Medical Floor on [**2143-1-14**].  Management of his multiple medical problems as
initiated in the Intensive Care Unit was continued.  The
patient continued to have a stable but elevated oxygen
requirement.  Heparin was discontinued on [**1-15**], after
three days of therapeutic INR.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   The patient is medically stable for
discharge to Rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To Rehabilitation.
