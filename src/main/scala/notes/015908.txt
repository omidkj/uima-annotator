HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old man
who was transferred from [**Hospital3 3765**] for evaluation of
weakness and numbness for the past 72 hours.  The patient
works as a limo driver to the State of [**State 350**] and is a
physically demanding job.  Last Wednesday prior to admission
the patient contracted a flulike illness and then experienced
malaise and general body weakness over the next few days.
Over the weekend prior to admission the patient continued to
have this flulike illness with diarrhea present.

On the Monday, 24 hours prior to admission the patient called
in sick to work because of the flu like illness and at 5:00
p.m. noticed that his legs were stiff and tired.  He went out
for a beer with his friends and from 5:30 to 6:30 noticed
that he could not get out of his chair.  After repeated
attempts to get out of the chair that were unsuccessful the
patient called EMS and was transferred to [**Hospital3 3765**].

The patient was tentatively diagnosed with Guillain-[**Location (un) **]
syndrome as they noticed the pattern of ascending weakness
and transferred him to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.  The
patient did report that he felt sensory changes relating to
ankles spreading down to his toes 24 hours prior to admission
after he had taken a nap on Monday.  These sensory changes
were unchanged on his presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**].  When I
first came in to evaluate the patient he provided the history
above but rejected my questions many times and stated that he
did not seek admission at this time after being cleared by
psychiatry as competent.  The patient agreed to being
admitted to the hospital for further workup.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature was 97.3 F.
Blood pressure 194/180.  Heart rate 78.  Respiratory rate 20.
On initial physical examination the patient had pertinent
positives as follows:  The patient was in mild respiratory
distress.  Neck was supple with no midline tenderness, no
lymphadenopathy.  Lungs showed moderately low total volume
and were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
exam was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, gallops or
rubs.  Extremities showed good peripheral pulses and no
edema.  Abdomen was soft and nontender.  On rectal
examination the patient had stool in the vault with good
rectal tone.  On back there was no tenderness.  On neurologic
examination, mental status the patient was awake, alert,
oriented, cooperative, fluent, following commands.  On
cranial nerve examination, gaze was midline.  Pupils were
equal and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
muscles are intact.  The patient had full facial strength and
sensation.  Uvula, palate were midline.  On motor
examination, the patient had 5/5 strength in the upper
extremity and lower extremity the patient had [**2-13**] a the
iliopsoas, [**3-16**] at the quadriceps, 4+/5 knee flexors, [**2-13**]
dorsiflexors of foot and 4+/5 plantar flexors of the foot.
On sensory exam, strength, position sense and pin prick were
impaired from the ankle down to the toes bilaterally in a
stocking distribution.  On reflex examination notably the
patient was areflexic in both upper and lower extremities.
Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  On coordination exam, the
patient finger-nose-finger were not ataxic.  The patient was
too weak to perform heel-to-shin without bias.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had NIF of 32 on vital capacity
on one to two liters.  Screening complete blood count showed
white blood cell count 18.1.  Normal Chem 7, CK, liver
function tests.

Lumbar puncture showed three white blood cells, zero red
blood cells, total protein of 46 and glucose of 79.  Gram
stain was negative.  Cultures are pending which turned out to
be negative.

Chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe pneumonia.

EMG obtained on [**2-12**] was consistent with acute
generalized acquired demyelinating sensory motor
polyradicular neuropathy consistent with Guillain-[**Location (un) **]
syndrome, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
The patient had negative cytology on lumbar puncture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was immediately admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit with emergent management of respiratory
status as the patient's NIF was concerning a negative 32.
The patient was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit for 48
hours and subsequent q.4h. NIFs and forced vital capacities
demonstrated the patient was stable from a respiratory point
of view.  His strength in his upper extremities was unchanged
for 48 hours and his lower extremities his exam was unchanged
for 48 hours.  The patient was then transferred to the
general medical floor.

On the transfer the patient was covered with Ceftriaxone for
a left lower lobe pneumonia.  On the general medical floor
the patient's weakness from day four through day 11 of
hospitalization continued to involve his upper extremities,
as the patient had serial motor exams documented at his
bedside on a work sheet.  Motor exams demonstrated that the
patient developed distal greater than proximal weakness in a
[**2-13**] at finger flexors and finger extensors distally and 4-/5
at triceps and deltoids proximally.

On day seven of admission the patient also developed a facial
diplegia involving frontalis ovicularsorus and ocular
muscles.  Vigilant pulmonary monitoring was continued on the
general medical floor and the patient's NIF had forced vital
capacities, remained stable at an average of 1.1 and -70 the
80.  The patient was also noted to be diaphoretic during this
time of admission and had several blood pressure drops and
falls consistent with the autonomic debility seen in
Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.  The patient's blood pressure was
treated with Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. three times a day and
Hydralazine 5 mg intravenous p.r.n. only for systolic blood
pressures greater than 200.  The patient was also maintained
on Heparin subcutaneous and meticulous nursing care to
prevent ulcers and deep vein thrombosis in his lower
extremities which are weak and bed bound.

Plasmaphoresis was started in the Intensive Care Unit and
five treatments were given through the patient's course on
the general medical floor.  Because of the development of the
facial diplegia and new upper extremity weakness the patient
immediately received five treatments of intravenous
immunoglobulin over the next five days from hospital day 11
to 15.  The patient's motor exam remains stable over this
time and on day 14 of hospital admission the patient's motor
exam dramatically improved as his lower extremities were 4+/5
and the patient's upper extremities also improved to a 4+/5
distally.  The patient's facial diplegia was unchanged at
this time.

The patient had several speech and swallow evaluations and it
was determined that the patient was able to tolerate food
although it did show small amounts of aspiration.  The
patient was then prophylactically started on Flagyl for
aspiration pneumonia in addition to Ceftriaxone and the
patient completed 14 day courses of each.

During the patient's time on the general medical floor he
developed diffuse sensory polyneuropathy with diffuse loss to
pin prick and soft touch bilaterally.  The patient was
maintained on Gabapentin 300 mg p.o. three times a day for
the polyneuropathy.  The patient was also maintained on
famotidine 20 mg p.o. twice a day.  The patient's social
situation was complicated as he needed Mass Health free care
and placement with a rehabilitation facility.

Social workers on the neurology team worked diligently to
arrange for the patient to have his first choice and
priorities met while taking care of administrative issues
related to the patient's insurance.

On the general medical floor, NIFs and FVCs through [**2-26**] were stable with FVCs of 1.2 and NIFs of -70 to 80.  The
patient's last chest x-ray on [**2161-2-17**] showed residual
infiltrates at the site of left lower posterior [**Doctor First Name **]
segments of consolidation suggesting resolving pneumonia.
The patient is now
