Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
76 year old woman with type 2 DM complicated by ESRD on HD,
hypertension/hyperlipidemia, CHF (EF 30-40% in [**3-/2162**]), severe
AS, sarcoidosis who presented to ED with respiratory distress.
Patient describes feeling "weak" and acutely short of breath
around 2 am which lasted approximately 2 hours. She describes
associated nausea, no vomiting. Denies chest pain, jaw or arm
pain. Denies cough, fever, chills. Denies recent increase in
fluid intake or decrease in fluid removal at [**Year (4 digits) 2286**]. Denies
increase in lower extremity edema. Reports baseline orthopnea
and PND - no change recently.
.
Documentation from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] reports patient not feeling
well with shortness of breath at 3am - VS T 97.2, BP 80/53, HR
103, RR 24, O2 Sat 94% 2 L - reported appearing diaphoritic with
FS 257. EMS documented BP 172/88, O2 Sat high 70s, speaking in
short sentances and working to breath. On arrival to the ED
patient required NRB with T 97.8, HR 97, BP 160/125, RR 28.
Patient hypertensive during ED stay ranging 159-198/95-115. She
had peaked T waves on EKG consequently received calcium,
dextrose and insulin. Femoral line was needed to be placed for
labs and notable for K 4.5, Creatinine 4.5, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 35408**], HCT 27.1
(baseline 27) and lactate 1.5. CXR revealed hazy opacity right
lung base suggestive of atelactasis and prominent mediastinum
suggesting volume overload. Patient was treated with albuterol.
Due to continued respiratory distress required BiPap. On
transfer vitals HR 85 RR 16 BP 173/78 100% BiPap (settings FiO2
30%, [**1-16**]).
.
On arrival to ICU patient reports feeling well andn denies any
shortness of breath, weakness or chest pain. She is on 3 L NC on
arrival.
.
Of note, patient has had several admissions to the hospital,
most recently discharged [**2163-1-31**] for syncope felt to be
secondary to severe AS. For concern of bactermia patient was
discharged on Vancomycin for 14 days which was completed
[**2163-2-10**] however no blood cultures were ever positive. Patient
also had a recent ICU stay [**2163-1-18**] for LGIB felt to be secondary
to a diverticular bleed.
.
ROS (+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills. Denies headache, cough, shortness of
breath. Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denies
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2163-2-12**] 4:23 AM
FINDINGS:

Single portable upright chest radiograph was obtained. The study
is extremely
limited due to patient motion. A right internal jugular central
[**Date Range 2286**]
catheter ends at the right atrium. Cardiomediastinal contours
are stable.
There is a hazy opacity overlying the right lung base, which may
represent
atelectasis. No left pleural effusions or pneumothorax is
identified. A small
rigth pleural effusion may be present. Prominence of the
vascular interstitium
suggests a mild degree of volume overload.

IMPRESSION:

Extremely limited study. Possible right basal atelectasis and
mild volume
overload.
.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2163-2-13**] 5:31 AM
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2163-2-12**].

There is cardiomegaly, which is stable. There is a right-sided
central venous catheter with distal lead tip in the right
atrium. There is mild prominence of pulmonary interstitial
markings, consistent with pulmonary edema. There is a left
retrocardiac opacity and small bilateral pleural effusions. No
pneumothoraces are identified. Overall, the findings are likely
unchanged allowing for patient motion.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old woman w/ CAD on ASA/Plavix, ESRD on HD, type 2 DM,
severe AS who presents with acute episode of shortness of breath
requiring BiPap in the emergency department.
.
# Respiratory distress: Patient was treated initially with BiPAP
in the emergency department. She spent one night in the ICU with
BiPAP which was able to be weaned off without difficulty and she
was weaned down to to 1-2L nasal cannula by time of discharge
with O2 Saturation in the mid 90s range. Patient tolerated room
air without difficulty, but was kept on nasal cannula for
comfort.  Respiratory distress was felt to be secondary to
combination of poor physiological compensation with severe
aortic stenosis in the setting of flash pulmonary edema due to
rising hypertension and elevated heart rates. Heart rate
controlled with carvedilol and BiPAP intervention. Also had
better blood pressure control after con
