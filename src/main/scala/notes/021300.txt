History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 57- year-old male patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4468**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with
h/o CAD, CHF, ESRD, DM2, PVD, and right SFA narrowing. Patient
was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1474**] on [**12-17**] with bilateral LE
cellulitis vs. gangrene. Recently fell at home and broke his
ribs PTA and hit his head. He is also noted to have a right
pleural effusion. Has severe neuropathy at baseline, ambulated
with walker. Transferred from OSH for SFA cath/stent with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] on 4 liters of O2 and sats 90-92%. On arrival patient
appeared to be volume overloaded and unable to lie flat for
angio procedure so patient went to HD instead of procedure. Per
family, pt has been confused and increasingly lethargic over
this past week. They were very concerned about his fall at home.
After HD and uneventful cath to SMA with stent pt returned to
the floor on nasal cannula. At approximately 5am pt was noted to
brady down and have PEA arrest. Received treatment and pulses
returned once intubated.

Imaging:
*********
.
[**2138-12-24**]: CXR
The upper margin of this film is T1 and the lateral aspect of
the left lower chest is excluded. A segment of tubing projects
over the midline ending at the thoracic inlet. I cannot tell
whether this is an ET tube or nasogastric tube. Tip of the right
central venous catheter projects over the right brachiocephalic
vein but is angled at the tip and may be entering a small
branch. Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged and a small
right pleural effusion is present. Lungs are grossly clear.
Stomach is mildly distended with gas.  There is no indication of
pneumothorax.
.
[**2138-12-24**] Head CT:
FINDINGS: There is intravascular and dural enhancement.
Otherwise, no evidence for intracranial hemorrhage is present.
There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are normal in configuration.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction appears distinct. Osseous
structures are unremarkable. Fluid levels are present within the
sphenoid sinuses that may be secondary to intubation. There is
also some mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinuses. The
maxillary sinuses are clear. The mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for intracranial mass effect or gross
hemorrhage. MR is more sensitive for the evaluation of acute
brain ischemia.
.
[**2138-12-24**]: CT Chest
FINDINGS: There is no pulmonary embolism to the level of the
subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Pre-contrast images demonstrate
no dense intramural hematoma in the aorta. There is aortic and
coronary artery atherosclerosis. There is a mildly enlarged
right hilar lymph node measuring 1.5 x 1.8 cm in diameter. There
is no aortic dissection. There is four-chamber cardiomegaly. The
interventricular septum is bowed toward the left ventricle
indicative of elevated right heart pressures. There is a large
right pleural effusion. There is no pericardial effusion. There
is no left pleural effusion.  Lung windows demonstrate near
complete atelectasis of the right lower lobe. The right middle
and right upper lobe are well aerated. There is subsegmental
atelectasis in the dependent portions of the left lung.  The
airways are clear. No mass is visualized. The endotracheal tube
is above the carina. There is a nasogastric tube present.
Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate hepatomegaly and
contrast material in the IVC consistent with elevated right
heart pressures. The enlarged liver may be secondary to chronic
passive venous congestion.  There is a nasogastric tube present
coursing through the gastric lumen. Its tip is not visualized.
Bone windows demonstrate no blastic or lytic lesions.
Degenerative changes are present in the spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism t
