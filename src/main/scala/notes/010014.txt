Transfered from [**Hospital 18112**] hospital for Inferior myocardial
infarction.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
RCA stent


History of Present Illness:
This is a 57 year old man, with a past medical history of CABG
and PFO closure in [**12-24**], s/p renal transplant secondary to

chest pain and an electrocardiogram showed ST segment changes in
the inferior leads which was consistent with an inferior MI.
Patinet underwent cardiac catheterization ([**2155-7-13**]) with

the end of the procedure and was treated with zophrin and
atropine.  Pt was then transerred to the CCU.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to CCU for medical management post
myocardial infarction and stent placement.  He remained stable.
He did develop an eight centimeter pseudoaneurysm and A-V
fistula on his left groin site.  [**Month/Day/Year **] surgery was consulted
and said it was to small to intervene.  He will follow up with
surgery for another ultrasound to assess the size. He was seen
by transplant team for management of his transplant medications.
 Renal was consulted for management of his Wegeners
Granulomatosa.  As patient had a stent placed and had a history
of an allergy to [**Month/Day/Year **], he was desensitized to [**Month/Day/Year **].  The
desensitization was successful without any adverse events.  ENT
was consulted for epistaxis prophylaxis while on [**Month/Day/Year **], patient
started on saline nasal spray.  He was transferred out of the
CCU to the floor and discharged on [**2155-7-16**].

Problem [**Name (NI) **]:

# CAD/Ischemia: history of CAD (CABG in [**2154**]), Pt had ST
elevations on ECG in inferior leads with ST elevation in V3R,
which are 90% sensitive for RV infarct. Cath complicated by
vagal symptoms towards end of procedure treated with Zofran and
Atropine. Pt. Desensitized to [**Year (4 digits) **] on [**2155-7-14**].
- Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Statin
- patient monitored on telemetry
- As pt had RV infarct (by EKG, no right heart cath performed),
avoid nitroglycerin for chest pain as RV infarct patients are
preload dependent.
.
# Pump: Current echo LVEF 35-40%, LV apical dyskinesis and LV
inferior/inferior-lateral hypokinesis. Pt with some orthopnea.
- Fluid status closely monitored.
- Pt started on Lasix 40 po.
.
# Rhythm:  Pt having runs of NSVT on telemetry. Likely secondary
to hypokalemia, also possibly due to reperfusion. History of
paroxysmal A-fib, has  cardioversion.
- monitor on telemetry
- On Metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] for rate control, titrate up to home dose
as BP tolerates
- Will stop Amiodarone as NSVT was peri MI and did not recur
.
# Hypertension: It was noted in a prior note on OMR that pt's
blood pressure should be managed with beta blocker, a small dose
of ACEi and Nifedipine. If necessary Nifedipine should be
titrated up as it is safe in the renal transplant setting.
- C/w BB and ACEi as BP tolerates.
- Nitrates were held as blood pressure stable.  Can be
re-assessed as outpatient.
- Pt should have BP check by PCP or NP within 1-2 weeks of D/C
.
# Valves: +2 MR, Mitral valve leaf thickening.  Mild aortic
valve thickening.
.
# Left femoral bruit: Bruit over left groin where venous and
arterial access lines were pulled. Systolic and diastolic bruit
likely due to av fistula. L groin U/S showing 8mm
pseudoaneurysm.
- Per [**Hospital1 1106**] surgery, pseudoaneurysm is to small to treat
(<2cm).  F/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Last Name (STitle) 1106**] clinic.
.
# Wegeners Granulomatosis: Has been in remission for 10+ yrs.
Stable.
- Monitor respiratory status
- Monitor HCT
- Follow ENT recs Re: epistaxis prevention:  Saline nasal
flushes three times a day.
.
# Renal transplant: End-stage renal disease secondary to
Wegener's granulomatosis, received a living related renal
transplant from his sister on [**2154-5-14**]. Baseline Cr 1.7. Pt.
back to baseline Cr.
- Continue tacrolimus and myfortic
- Dose meds for CrCL of 50.
.
# DM: Sliding scale insulin.
.
# FEN: Cardiac/Heart-healthy low salt diabetic diet
.
# Prophylaxis: [**Year (4 digits) **]
