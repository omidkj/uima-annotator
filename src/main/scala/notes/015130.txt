HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year old
gentleman with a history of previous strokes in [**2118**] and in
[**2122-11-1**], who was admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] as a transfer from [**Hospital **] Hospital emergency
room after a fall.  His history dates back to [**2118**] when he
had an episode of slurred speech and clumsiness with his
right hand, leading him to write sloppily.  These deficits
lasted for about six weeks or so.  He did well until about
[**2122-11-1**] when he experienced the acute onset of
hemiparesis and facial droop on the left and he was treated
at [**Hospital **] Hospital.  He was briefly put on Coumadin and then
discontinued after some complications with GI bleeding.  He
had a complicated post stroke course and ended up receiving a
tracheostomy and a PEG tube for feeding, which were both
removed in [**Month (only) 547**] and [**2123-4-1**] respectively.  He had been at a
rehab facility until [**2123-7-2**].  He was living at home in
[**Location (un) 13011**] with his 24 hour caregivers.  [**Name (NI) **] falls a lot,
according to his wife, but this is not different since before
the stroke in [**Month (only) 1096**], according to her.  He has not had any
episodes of seizure like activity, abrupt changes in mood,
personality or speaking difficulties.  He had recently
visited his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], at [**Hospital **] Hospital
about six weeks prior to admission and it was decided at that
time that he should be put back on Coumadin for his history
of atrial fibrillation.  On the Monday before admission the
patient fell out of his wheelchair, hitting his left hip and
head.  He did well until Tuesday morning when he was noted to
have a headache as well as some nausea and vomiting.  His
caregiver had called an ambulance and called his wife who was
working in [**Name (NI) 86**].  By the time she got home, he had already
shooed away the EMTs.  The next morning she called EMTs again
because he was confused and she thought this was a gradual
change over that morning.  He was speaking with words that
made sense by themselves, but were put together in incorrect
sentences.  She has not noted any personality changes or
abrupt changes in mood.  He was brought to [**Hospital **] Hospital
E.D. and subarachnoid blood was noted in addition to temporal
lobe contusion.  He was transferred for further management.
He was thought to be speaking fluently, but incoherently on
exam.  Repeat CT showed a subdural hematoma after he came to
[**Hospital1 69**].  He was given five
units of FFP, platelets and 10 mg of vitamin K to reverse his
INR which was found to be 1.87 at [**Hospital **] Hospital E.D.  He
was placed on a Nipride drip for blood pressure control to
systolic blood pressure of less than 140 and he gradually
improved in the ICU until the morning of transfer to the
neurology service.  His wife came in on the morning of
transfer from the ICU to the neuro floor and noticed a
dramatic change, much more like his usual self.  The weakness
was not different than from before his fall, according to his
wife.

War II.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Not obtained.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100.6, heart rate 78,
respiratory rate 29, O2 sat 96 percent in room air.  In
general, he was a well appearing, elderly man in no apparent
distress.  HEENT revealed dry mucous membranes.  Lungs
revealed some coarse upper airway breath sounds.
Cardiovascular exam revealed regular rate and rhythm without
murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen was soft and nontender.
Extremities showed Multi Podus boot on the left.  Neck
movements were full and not painful to palpation in the
paraspinal soft tissues.  On mental status the patient was
alert and recalled two objects at three minutes which
increased to three out of three with cues.  He had good
knowledge for current events.  He was able to say that [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2450**] is the son of [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 2450**].  Language was intact in
naming, repetition and comprehension.  There was no apraxia
or agnosia.  There was no left/right agnosia.  Cranial nerves
visual acuity was intact.  Visual fields were full.  Optic
disks were difficult to visualize due to myotic pupils 2 mm.
Pupil size on the right was about 2 1/2 mm and on the left
roughly 3 [**12-3**].  Eye movements were normal.  Pupils reacted
normally to light.  Sensation on the face was intact to light
touch and pin.  There was a facial droop on the left.
Hearing was intact to finger rub.  There was no nystagmus.
Palate elevated in the midline.  Tongue protruded slightly
left of the midline and is normal in appearance.
Sternocleidomastoid muscles were strong bilaterally.  Speech
was slightly slurred, according to his family, who were
present.  Motor had increased tone in the left upper
extremity.  There was 3/5 strength on the left side.  The
right side was [**4-5**] in the upper and lower extremities.  There
were no adventitious movements.  Coordination there was no
ataxia.  Finger/nose test and heel/shin test were performed
accurately on the right.  Deep tendon reflexes were all
present, but brisker on the left throughout.  Plantar
responses were flexor on the right and extensor on the left.
Sensation was intact to light touch, pin, temperature and
joint position of the extremities and the trunk.  Gait and
stairs were deferred.

IMAGING STUDIES:  CT of the head showed a small left temporal
subdural hematoma that extended along the superior margin of
the left tentorium.  There was a small hemorrhagic contusion
within the left inferior lateral temporal lobe.  There was a
small subarachnoid hemorrhage adjacent to the contusion.  The
inferior left temporal lobe was slightly edematous compared
with the right.  There was no shift in midline structures.
There was no hydrocephalus.  There was no evidence of
fracture.  MRI of the head showed no diffusion restriction.
There was susceptibility artifact in the vicinity of the
temporal bone, but otherwise no other susceptibility artifact
apart from where it was expected near the contusion.  Motion
artifact was present on the MRA.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from the ICU to
neurology and did well.  He was initially loaded on Dilantin
while in the ICU for concern of seizure resulting in the
inability to speak.  He was continued on Dilantin 300 mg p.o.
q.d. and tolerated this well.  He was ruled out for MI.  We
also held aspirin and Coumadin to let the bleed subside.  He
had hip films and a chest x-ray which showed no evidence of
pelvic or hip fracture in the setting of no hip pain.  Chest
x-ray also did not show any heart failure or pneumonia.  The
patient was cleared by P.T./O.T. for home with services and
he was referred back to VNA.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Subdural hematoma with left temporal brain contusion.
2.  Diabetes.
3.  Hypertension.
