History of Present Illness:
This is 72M NH patient w/ tracheostomy who was tx from his NH
for fevers and worsening secretions. The patient was recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2025**].  During this admission at [**Hospital1 2025**], a R IJ had
been placed for Abx (vanc for 14 days due to MRSA in sputum and
urine).  In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED his vitals were as follows: T102 HR 92
BP 193/77 RR31 O2 sat 100%. It was thought that his source of
infection was this central line it was removed.  Peripherals
were inserted.  UA was negative.  CK was elevated at 2432,
however troponin was 0.01. His ABG was 7.52/34/94.  EKG showed
EKG of 84, nl axis, no ST elevations or depressions. CXR showed
no evidence of pneumonia. CT of the head showed 6mm R subdural
hematoma which appeared to be chronic (per [**Hospital1 2025**] records this is
chronic. Sputum and blood cultures were sent.

As stated the patient  was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2025**] ICU from [**2182-9-18**]
to [**2182-9-28**].  His principal diagnosis was a L MCA stroke.  He
presented with sudden onset of aphasia and right arm weakness.
Due to his large territory infarct (L MCA) anticoagulation was
not initiated.  The patient's course was also complicated by
MRSA in the sputum and urine.  Beginning on [**9-22**] he was
scheduled to receive 14 days of vancomycin. The failed swallow
and an PEG was placed.  The patient had been intubated in the ED
for unclear reason.  Following his extubation in the ICU, the
patient was trached due to copious secretions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Fevers:  Initially presented with fevers and copious respiratory
secretions. A pulmonary source was suspected.  Preliminary
sputum showed gram positive cocci and gram negative rods and was
covered broadly with vancomycin, ceftaz, and clindamycin.
Vancomycin was changed to linezolid as patient was currently on
vancomycin when he became ill and therefore appeared to fail
vancomycin.  The patient had a central line for 2 weeks, which
was pulled as it was a possible source of infection.  Final
cultures for sputum indicated oral flora.  Blood cultures have
been no growth to date.  As cultures came back negative and
afebrile, broad coverage antibiotics were discontinued although
the plan is to continue a 10 day course of levofloxacin.
.
Recent CVA: Subdural hematoma on CT appears chronic by our
records and OSH.  continue aspirin. Statin held for elevated CK
(troponin remained within normal limits).  CK and LFTs decreased
while off statin.  Keppra was continued for seizure prophylaxis.

.
Elevated CK: may be [**1-17**] to statin started for CVA, LFTs and CK
improved when statin held.
.
FEN: continued tube feeds through PEG.
.
PPX: heparin sc, PPI
.
Access: central line pulled as it was in for 2 weeks and a
likely source of infection.  Peripheral IV
