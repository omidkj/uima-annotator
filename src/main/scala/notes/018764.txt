Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Pericardial effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial window

History of Present Illness:
67 yF with h/o metastatic cervical cancer c/b bulky LAD w/R
hydronephrosis necessitating nephrostomy tube placement,
hypercoagulability resulting in mult CVAs and more recently,
PE/[**Hospital 19601**] transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for management of pericardial effusion
and UGIB. 1 week prior to this admission, she was treated for
PE/DVT and CAP at [**Hospital3 7569**], d/c'ed on lovenox /
coumadin; she was treated with levaquin in-house, which was not
continued on an out-patient basis. During that admission, she
had an echo showing a pericardial effusion. She was d/c'ed prior
to final read of a f/u echo, which showed increased size of the
effusion. Thus, she was called to return to [**Location (un) **] the day
after d/c ([**5-7**]). Incidentally, pt had hematemesis x3 on that day
as well. Pt was transferred from [**Location (un) **] ED to [**Hospital1 **] and was
admitted to the CCU where she was also followed by CT [**Doctor First Name **] and
GI. While in the CCU she received 2U PRBCs for her UGIB which
had remitted. NGL cleared, so upper endo was not pursued. She
underwent pericardial window for drainage of effusion. Finally,
she underwent R ureteral stent and IVC filter placment by IR.
Her acute cardiac issues had resolved and she was called out to
the medicine service.
.
On the day of transfer to medicine, pt's creat (b/l 1.1) had
risen to 2.0, despite stent placement, prompting a Renal
consult. In addition, her coags were elevated and trending up
with an INR of 3.6 (DIC labs neg; LFTs WNL), despite being off
coumadin since admission.

Echo [**2199-5-7**]:
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 55% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Ascending: *3.7 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.3 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2199-2-28**].
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
(LVEF>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets.
PERICARDIUM: Moderate pericardial effusion. No significant
respiratory
variation in mitral/tricuspid valve flows. Brief RA diastolic
collapse. [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 7216**] collapse.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Results were reviewed with the Cardiology
Fellow involved with the patient's care. Bilateral pleural
effusions. Ascites.

Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is a
moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion extending
2.4cm inferior and 2cm lateral to the left ventricle, but <1cm
around the apex and anterior to the right ventricle. There is
brief right atrial and left atrial diastolic collapse without
eccentuation of transmitral E wave velocities.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2199-2-28**], the
pericardial
effusion is new. Serial evaluation is suggested.
.
CTA Chest [**2199-5-8**]:
1. Chronic pulmonary embolism in the right lung.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Large pericardial effusion.
3. Ascites.
.
Pleural fluid cytology: Rare atypical epithelioid cells present.
Scattered mesothelial cells and numerous lymphocytes.
.
Pericardial fluid cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
.
Renal U/S [**2199-5-14**]: Small kidneys bilaterally with normal
arterial and venous waveforms. The right hydronephrosis has
resolved status post stenting. Large volume ascites is noted.

Renal scan: 1. Renal parenchymal disease of the right kidney
with no evidence of obstruction. 2. Partial obstruction of the
left kidney. Superimposed renal parenchymal disease of the left
kidney cannot be excluded.
.
CXR [**2199-5-15**]: Resolution of previously seen apical pneumothorax
on the left. Unchanged appearance of bibasilar patchy
atelectasis/consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pericardial effusion: Pt was found to have a new pericardial
effusion on Echo, was seen by thoracic surgery, and underwent
thorascopic pericardial window with chest tube insertion.  She
was noted to have 100cc of serosanguinous fluid drained from the
pericardium itself, along with 500cc of pleural fluid.  Both
fluids were sent for cytology, with the pleural fluid noted to
contain atypical cells concerning for malignancy and the
pericardial fluid devoid of atypical cells.  She had a repeat
echo, which showed a small pocket of apical fluid collection and
resolution of the larger pericardial effusion.  Oncology noted
that the patient could be followed as an outpatient for further
management of the pleural malignancy.  The chest tube was pulled
without complications.

2. GI Bleed: The patient was initially started on heparin drip
due to concerns about the presence of PE; however, this
medication was discontinued as her hematocrit decreased while on
the drip.  She was transfused and her Hct remained stable
following.  Further workup of the GI bleed can be done as an
outpatient.

3. Chronic PE: As above, the patient was placed on the heparin
drip for 1 day for concern of PE/DVT, but as she had an IVC
filter placed this drip was discontinued.  She was asymptomatic
throughout. Given her hypercoagulability, she will likely need
long-term AC, which may be re-initiated on an outpatient basis
after the IVC filter has been removed.

4. R nephrostomy/acute renal failure: On admission, pt's creat
was 1.1, began climbing on HD#4, and peaked at 2.1 on HD#9. She
had had a nephrostomy tube placed in [**3-6**] obstruction of
her R kidney and resultant ARF at that time. On the weekend of
[**4-4**], her urine output decreased and her nephrostomy output
also decreased.  She was given large amounts of fluid as her
CVPs were low (0-6), but her urine output fail
