Date of Birth:   [**2104-3-14**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease, status post
anterolateral myocardial infarction, status post percutaneous
coronary intervention of left anterior descending artery and
first diagonal artery stenting complicated by apical thrombus
requiring emergent coronary artery bypass grafting with
advanced heart failure and an ejection fraction of 14%.  He
was now admitted for elective right cardiac catheterization
and titration of medications.

Since his recent discharge from [**Hospital1 188**] earlier this month, the patient noticed increasing
lower extremity edema and an increase in his weight of over
16 pounds from his ideal body weight of 170 pounds.  He had
been compliant with medications.  He reported that he was
able to walk slowly and climb one flight of stairs since
starting outpatient physical therapy.  He developed dyspnea
and chest tightness with further exertion.  On admission,
vital signs were stable.  The patient was pain free and
without complications.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home included
amiodarone, atenolol, aldactone, Lasix, Digoxin, Coumadin one
p.o. q.o.d., Lipitor, Zoloft, Niferex, Prilosec, Zestril and
multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had an allergy to neosporin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lived with his wife in [**Name (NI) **].
He quit alcohol 40 years ago.  He quit smoking 11 years ago
after 50 pack years.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father had hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was
generally comfortable, lying supine in no apparent distress
and nontoxic.  Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of
106/60, a heart rate of 77, a respiratory rate of 16, a
temperature of 98.0??????F and an oxygen saturation of 93% on four
liters by nasal cannula.  The head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination revealed jugular venous pressure to the
jaw at 30 degrees with positive hepatojugular reflux.

The lungs had crackles at the bases bilaterally with a
moderate amount of air movement and no wheezes.  The cardiac
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2,
with a positive S3.  There was a II/VI holosystolic murmur at
the left lower sternal border, radiating to the axilla,
consistent with mitral regurgitation and a III/VI
holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border,
increased with inspiration and consistent with tricuspid
regurgitation.  The abdomen was soft, nontender and
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  The extremities had
3 to 4+ lower extremity edema up to the upper thighs, 2+
distal pulses and 2+ femoral pulses.  The neurological
examination was nonfocal.

CARDIAC STUDIES:  The electrocardiogram on admission revealed
an atrioventricularly paced ventricular rate of 75 with no
atrial activity, a regular and wide QRS of 202 ms with
superior access of -70 degrees.  When compared to the study
of [**2176-5-9**], there was no change.

A transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2176-5-24**] showed (1) marked
biatrial enlargement, (2) severe left ventricular dilation,
(3) apical kinesis in entire left ventricle with basal
sparing, (4) a large anterior apical aneurysm without
thrombus, (5) severe global right ventricular hypokinesis,
(6) 4+ mitral regurgitation and (7) 4+ tricuspid
regurgitation.

An exercise tolerance test MIBI on [**2176-5-17**] showed severe
fixed defects of the septum, anterior wall apex and apical
inferior lateral walls.  There was an ejection fraction of
14%.

LABORATORY:  On admission, the patient had a white blood cell
count of 4600, hematocrit of 27.8, hemoglobin of 8.9,
platelet count of 147,000 and MCV of 85.  Prothrombin time
was 13.5, partial thromboplastin time was 27.2 and INR was
1.2.  Chem 7 revealed a sodium of 143, potassium of 4.6,
chloride of 105, bicarbonate of 24, BUN of 18, creatinine of
1.2 and glucose of 16.  The CK on admission was 46.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission, [**2176-6-10**], the
patient had a right internal jugular Cordis placed with a
Swan-Ganz catheter floated afterwards.  The right atrial
pressure was 20.  The right ventricular pressure was 55/20.
The pulmonary artery pressure was 55/22.  The pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was 25 with Vital signs as high as
45.

1.  CARDIAC:  The patient was started on medications
including amiodarone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lopressor 12.5 mg
p.o. b.i.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
q.d. and Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.   The patient was
aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix throughout his
stay.  The patient's physical examination and Swan-Ganz
catheter numbers were checked twice a day for signs of
improvement from his congestive heart failure.  The patient
was also started on heparin while his Coumadin was held for
anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.  The patient was
started on milrinone on [**2176-6-14**].  This was continued for
two days while his Swan-Ganz catheter numbers improved and
his wedge improved to less than 20.  The patient was also
started on Digoxin at this time.

The patient was aggressively diuresed throughout his stay and
at the time of discharge from the cardiac care unit on
[**2176-6-16**], he had lost 18.5 liters.  His weight at this time
had come down from somewhere around the 180 pound range to a
low of 156 pounds, which was deemed his dry weight.  The
patient was continued on Aldactone, Digoxin, Toprol XL and
Captopril throughout his stay.  The patient was changed from
intravenous Lasix to p.o. Lasix.

The patient was discharged on [**2176-6-18**] with a dry weight of
156 pounds and instructed to page [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 29097**] or M. Nastore for
an increase of weight of two pounds or to page the on-call
cardiology fellow on the weekends.  The patient was to follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for INR checks after heparin was
discontinued and Coumadin started for anticoagulation for his
atrial fibrillation.  The patient was to follow up with the
congestive heart failure clinic in two weeks.

2.  HEME:  The patient had a history of anemia of unclear
etiology.  He was transfused one unit of packed red blood
cells on [**2176-6-14**] for a hematocrit of 28.6 and a goal of 30.
At the time of discharge, the patient had a hematocrit of
35.2, which had been stable for several days.  The patient
will be followed as an outpatient for his anemia.

3.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient had a long standing
history of atrial fibrillation.  He was anticoagulated with
heparin while in the hospital, converted to 5 mg p.o. q.d. of
Coumadin, on which he will be followed for adjustments as an
outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was also put on
amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d., which he will continue as an
outpatient.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a question of
previous Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
pneumonia.  He was put on precautions for this and had nasal
and anal swabs checked.  These were ending at the time of
discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.
