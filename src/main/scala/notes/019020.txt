Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
sent for catheterization after found to have dilated CM on ECHO

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2174-6-7**] - Left heart catheterization, coronary angiogram
[**2174-6-14**] - Coronary artery bypass grafting times 5 with the left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and
reverse saphenous vein graft to the right acute marginal, first

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 y/o M with diabetes (diagnosed in [**1-/2174**]),
hyperlipidemia, HTN, and newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy
who is s/p catheterization.  The patient was initially supposed
to have shoulder surgery done this past [**Month (only) 958**], but was found to
have elevated sugars and diagnosed with DM.  The surgery was
rescheduled for earlier this month, and pre-operative ECHO was
done showing biventricular dilation and severe hypokinesis, with
mild mitral and moderate tricuspid regurgiation.  There was also
evidence of moderate pulmonary artery systolic HTN.  An EF of
[**9-3**]% was reported.  Despite this EF, the patient denies any
shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, or
decreased exercise tolerance due to fatigue.  He does have some
decreased exercise tolerance, but attributes it to R hip pain
not fatigue.  The patient also denies any history of PND or
sleep orthopnea.  The only symptoms that the patient does report
is leg swelling since [**Month (only) 205**].

On cath, LMCA had distal 50% disease, diffuse LAD disease with
80-90% occlusions in small vessel at mid and distal segments,
total occlusion of L cx after large OM1 and diffuse disease in
RCA marginal branches. Wedge pressure was 32, PA pressues in
70s, pt was given 40 mg IV Lasix.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was stable and CP free.

Past Medical History:
DM type 2, recently diagnosed [**1-/2174**]
high cholesterol
hypertension

Social History:
-Tobacco history:  denies
-ETOH:  used to drink heavily on weekends in 20-30s, [**11-2**]
beers/day
-Illicit drugs:  denies
The patient lives with his second wife and two children.  He has
three children from previous marriage.  He used to play soccer a
lot when he as younger, but stopped playing regularly six years
ago.  He still reports playing soccer now on occassion.
Originally from [**Country 7192**].

Family History:
grandmother had throat cancer (was a smoker)
aunt had DM

No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or
sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2174-5-25**]
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 15-20%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Biventricular dilatation and severe hypokinesis.
Mild mitral and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CARDIAC CATH:
[**2174-6-7**]
Coronary angiography:  left dominant
LMCA:  Distal 50%
LAD:  Diffuse disease with serial 80-90% occlusions in a small
vessel (2.0 mm) at the mid and distal segments.   Small diagonal
branches have diffuse disease.
LCX:  Total occlusion mid Cx after large OM1.  OM2 fills via
collaterals.
RCA:  Likely nondominant with diffuse diseas in marginal
branches
and serial 80% lesions.
Assessment & Recommendations
1.	CSURG consult
2.	Admit for management of decompensated CHF and titration of
medical therapy.
3.	Secondary prevention CAD and CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2174-6-7**] for a cardiac
catheterization. This revealed severe dilated cardiomyopathy
with three vessel disease. The cardiac surgery service was
consulted for surgical evaluation. He was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner including and viability study and carotid
ultrasound. The carotid ultrasound showed a 60-69% right
internal carotid artery stenosis and a 40% left internal carotid
artery stenosis. The viability study revealed a fixed defect in
the distal anterior and apical region. Given his high risk for
surgery, a tranplant consutation was obtained. Workup revealed
that he appeared to be an acceptable transplant/VAD candidate
should the need arise. On [**2174-6-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary bypass grafting to
five vessels. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperative he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. He was transfused with red blood cells for
postoperative anemia. He required several days of pressors prior
to extubation for blood pressure and cardiac output support. He
was also noted to aggitated as sedation was weaned and was thus
switched to precedex. He was ultimately extubated on [**2174-6-15**]. He
developed a fever however work-up was negative. As his
atelectasis improved, his fever went away. Coreg and lisniopril
were started given his heart failure. On [**2174-6-20**] he was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He
continued to be gently disuresed towards his preoperative
weight. He was noted to be fatigued, nauseated and jaundiced and
a liver ultrasound showed no evidence of acute cholecystitis,
some ascites and a poorly visualized pancreas. His total
bilirubin was elevated at 5 however trended down and was 3.9 on
discharge. His lipase was elevated at 85. His nausea improved.
He continued to wrok daily with the physical therapy service.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was discharged
home on [**2174-6-21**]. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
