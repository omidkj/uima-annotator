Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Coumadin / Xanax / Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**]
Chief Complaint:
difficulty breathing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with PMHx sCHF (EF 35-40%), Afibr s/p PPM, CVA, and
duodenal ulcer presented to OSH with sob/hypoxia. He had a
recent admission for ARF and NSTEMI (trop on the way down). He
was in 90s on 5L NC required NRB and AMS. CXR unimpressive. Labs
showed positive dimer, ABG showed respiratory alkalosis
concerning for PE as per OSH ED. Additionally, he has afib not
on coumadin due to allergy, but on aspirin and plavix. Given
levaquin at [**Location (un) 620**] for questionable UTI, but UA returned with
no WBC and no bacteria. CT head at [**Location (un) **] was negative then
heparinized for transfer. Currently unable to CT due to CRF.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 96.1 60 119/71 24 100, O2 sat 70's
off NRB. ABG: 7.44/27/141 Patient was transferred to MICU for
inpending respiratory failure and possible hypotension.
.
On the floor, he appeared in mild distress but stable. Found to
be sating well on 6 L NC without any additional need for O2
support. Reported that he used O2 at home 24/7. On further
questioning, patient was on face mask without O2 supplied for a
while in nursing home which led him to decrease in his sat.

==========================================================
Imaging:
TTE [**2172-6-23**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately-to-severely
depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with regional variability. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
--------
CXR [**2172-6-23**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac
silhouette has slightly increased. The pre-existing left pleural
effusion has also increased, causing a relatively extensive
retrocardiac atelectasis on today's examination.
Caliber of the pulmonary vasculature suggests mild
overhydration. No evidence of focal parenchymal opacity
suggesting pneumonia, but the lung parenchyma in the left mid
lung fields is slightly denser, presumably due to the left basal
effusion. Unchanged course of the left pectoral pacemaker. Close
radiographic monitoring is suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with PMHx sCHF (EF 35-40%), Afib s/p PM, CVA, and
duodenal ulcer presented to OSH after experience dizziness, SOB,
and CP at home.
.
#.  Hypoxemia: Likely secondary to decompensated systolic heart
failure.  He was tranferred to MICU where he was diuresed with
lasix drip and eventually transitioned to oral lasix.  His
hypoxemia improved with diuresis. He was subsequently
transferred to the floor where he was oxygenating well with home
2LNC.
.
# Systolic heart failure with EF of 35-40% (TTE [**2172-6-23**]):
Patient mildly volume overloaded on exam. As per above, he was
diuresed with IV lasix gtt. He was transitioned to oral lasix
40mg daily and remained euvolemic. Disharged on Toprol XL 25 mg
qdaily, aspirin 325 mg qdaily, simvastatin 80 mg qhs and lasix
40 mg po qdaily. Not on ACE-I/[**Last Name (un) **] secondary to CKD.
.
# AFib: Rate controlled during hospital stay. He is
anticoagulated with aspirin and plavix as he does not tolerate
warfarin well per his records.  He was in atrial fibrillation
vpaced at 60bpm during his hospital stay.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatine elevated to 3.1 on
admission likely reflecting pre-renal/ATN in setting of heart
failure. This improved to 2.9 after diuresis. His baseline is
around 2.3. Would suggest rechecking BUN/Cr in a few days to
assure Cr elevation is resolving.
.
# Gout: Allopurinol was continued at renally dosed rate of every
other day.
