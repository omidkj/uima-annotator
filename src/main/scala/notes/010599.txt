Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, orthopnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis


History of Present Illness:
71 yo male with history of COPD, probable lung cancer and known
pericardial effusion presents with worsening shortness of breath
and orthopnea.  He was found to have early tamponade physiology
on echocardiogram report from [**Hospital6 1129**]
[**2153-9-12**] where echo revealed LV ejection fraction of 76%
and a moderate to  large circumferential pericardial effusion
with fibrin deposition  and impaired RV filling consistent with
early tamponade physiology in setting of estimated PASP 36 mmHg.
He refused drainage at that time. He was seen in clinic today
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and agreed to come in Wednesday for outpt
drainage.
.
His lung cancer diagnosis was suspected based on imaging
findings and smoking history though he declined biopsy and
future treatment if he did have pathologic diagnosis. He reports
10 pound weight loss and new onset paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
and orthopnea as well as episodic loose melena. He has had no
recent falls but that he still is very unstable due to his back
problems and occasional vertigo.
His main complaint is that he feels he still has pneumonia.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were [**6-10**] pain 97.8 101 153/70 28 96%
RA.  he complained of worsening SOB, heart racing, unclear story
of chest pain - most currently no chest pain, He denies pain in
his back neck or jaw. He also endorses chronic abdominal pain
times several months that is intermittent he has right now. He
associates this with his recurrent gas pain. No fever chills
nausea or vomiting. Comfortable currently
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

.
Pericardial Fluid Cytology: Wetread - Malignant cells
.
Pericardial Fluid Cell Block: Pending
.
IMAGING/STUDIES:
.
ECG [**10-2**]: Atrial fibrillation. Low voltage throughout the
tracing. Consider anterior wall myocardial infarction of
indeterminate age. No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
ECHO [**10-2**]:
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. There is right
ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-9-12**],
the pericardial effusion is now larger.
.
CXR Portable [**10-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Opacification of the right middle lobe which may
represent
atelectasis versus possible pneumonia. Small right pleural
effusion.
.
ABD XR [**10-2**]:
FINDINGS: AP and left lateral decubitus radiographs of the
abdomen were
provided. There is a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern and there
is no free
air. There is a meniscus seen in the right chest which is
presumably mobile
pleural effusion. The previously seen right middle lobe opacity
on the recent prior chest radiograph has resolved suggesting
that this was due to
atelectasis.
.
Duplex Doppler Abd/Pelv [**10-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Targetoid lesion measuring 1.8 cm in the right lobe of the
liver is
concerning for malignancy, including metastatic disease.
Abdominal MRI is
recommended for further evaluation.
2. Echogenic liver compatible with fatty infiltration. Other
forms of more
severe liver disease, including hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis are
not excluded on this study.
3. No ascites.
.
C.Cath [**10-3**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Pericardial effusion with echo evidence of tamponade
2. Successfully drained via sub-xiphoid approach using an 18 G
pericardial needle and drainage catheter.
.
ECHO [**10-3**]:
FOCUSED STUDY, POST-PERICARDIOCENTESIS: Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a very
small pericardial effusion located adjacent to the right atrial
free wall. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study
