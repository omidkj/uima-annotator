Attending:[**Doctor First Name 7926**]
Chief Complaint:
Incarcerated ventral hernia
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
chronic obstruction pulmonary disease
obstructive sleep apnea
diabetes mellitus
pulmonary artery hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2147-6-16**] - ventral hernia repair with mesh


History of Present Illness:
53F transfer from OSH for an incarcerated ventral hernia.
Patient reports a history of a ventral hernia repair in [**2144**]
that
recurred 1 month after the initial surgery but was always
reducible until 2 days ago, when she was no longer able to
manually reduce it.  It has since become increasingly painful
and
she is experiencing worsening nausea, no vomiting.  Her last BM
was 3 days ago and she has not passed flatus since.

Patient reports a complicated post-operative course after her
initial hernia operation at [**Hospital3 **] requiring an ICU
stay for "breathing problems".   She says this is why she was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for repair of her hernia.

Transfer to cardiology floor:
53F h/o COPD Aflutter s/p ablation [**2145**] transfer from OSH for an
incarcerated ventral hernia s/p repair on [**2147-6-16**].
In the [**Name (NI) 13042**], pt had Afib with RVR to 140s (no hypotension) and
was transferred on [**6-18**] to the SICU where a dilt gtt was
started. Her dilt gtt was weaned off, and propafenone (home med)
and metoprolol (home med) were started. On day of transfer, HR
on this regimen has been 90s-110s with blood pressure
120s-140s/40s-80s. O2 sats were low 90s on 5L N/C. She was noted
to be volume overloaded on exam, and lasix was initiated. She
was 4L negative during stay in SICU. On day of transfer she was
given 20mg IV lasix once in the SICU and was 1L negative as of
3pm. She occasionally converts back to sinus.

Imaging:
[**6-15**] CXR: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. NG tube passes out
of view below the diaphragm.

[**6-19**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly and
retrocardiac
atelectasis. Suspected small left pleural effusion. No newly
appeared focal
parenchymal opacities.

[**6-21**] TTE: The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Diastolic function could not be assessed.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global lef ventricular systolic
function. The right ventricle is not well seen but is probably
dilated and hypokinetic with severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

[**6-21**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Right axis deviation.Compared to the previous tracing of [**2147-6-18**]
the ventricular response has slowed. Otherwise, no diagnostic
interim change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Surgical course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted from the ED with intent to take her to the
operating room the next day.  Her hernia was incarcerated but
was able to be reduced in the ED.  Her hernia continued to
recur, however and plans were made to take her to the operating
room the next day.  She was kept NPO with IVF.  Overnight into
HD 2, she triggered for Afib with RVR in the 130s-140s.  She
responded well to IV lopressor and converted back into normal
sinus rythym.  She was taken to the operating room on [**2147-6-16**]
for repair. Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1863**] operative note for
additional details.

Her post-operative course was uncomplicated from a surgical
standpoint.  Her wound dressings were removed on POD 2 and the
incision was clean, dry, intact.  There was a small seroma
visible at the superior aspect of the wound.  It was monitored
and did not show signs of infection.  The patient was instructed
on signs of infection prior to her discharge.  On POD 1 into POD
2, she passed flatus and was advanced in her diet.  She
tolerated a regular diet without difficulty.

Her cardiac and respiratory status, though, required attention.
This patient had baseline paroxysmal afib and COPD prompting
continuous oxygen therapy in the initial post-op period.  She
went into atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 140s on
POD 1 in the [**Name (NI) 13042**].  The cardiology consult team assessed the
patient and recommended resumption of her home antiarrythmic and
beta blocker (propafenone and metoprolol).  She converted back
into normal sinus rythym but w
