Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from an OSH for an IPH.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
(Itubation at outside hospital)
J-tube placement
Nasogastric tube placement


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 78 year-old R handed female w. PMH of a fib, and
marginal zone Non-hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma with CNS involvement
who presents as a transfer from an OSH for an IPH.  Patient, who
lives alone in senior housing, was last seen normal at at 5 pm
yesterday ([**2160-10-17**]) after her daughter spoke to her on the
phone.  Patient was then called by her daughter today ([**2160-10-18**])
around 3:15 pm with no response on the phone.  The daughter
became concerned and called her aunt (patient's sister) who
lives
in the same complex.  The sister went up and found that her
blinds were still closed which she opens in the morning.  The
sister found the patient laying on the floor in a pile of coffee
ground emesis with dried blood on her face.  Patient was
nonverbal with minimal movement.  Sister describes the patient
as
gurgling with fluid.  EMS reports the patient made vocalizations
saying "I'm going to die" on the way to the OSH.

Past Medical History:
1) Hypertension
2) Asthma/?COPD (since age 40)
3) Chronic diastolic heart failure
4) Atrial fibrillation (not currently anticoagulated, per pt's
request)
5) Moderate pulmonary hypertension
6) Tricuspid regurgitation (3+ per ECHO performed in [**2155**])
7) CNS lymphoma diagnosed in [**2153**], s/p surgery and chemo, now in
remission
8) Vertigo, intermittent, began in [**2159**]


Social History:
Lives in her own apartment in Senior Living, has homemaker come
clean for her once a week.  Daughter lives nearby and is HCP.
Denies tobacco or EtOH use, but endorses extensive tobacco
exposure from husband in past.


Family History:
Non-contributory.

person, month and year. Hospital incorrect this a.m. Facial

CXR [**2160-11-3**]
1. Nasogastric tube is seen with ending at the level of the GE
junction and should be advanced for optimal positioning.
2. Stable right basilar atelectasis, without additional interval
change.

CT Head [**2160-10-30**]
1. Expected evolution of hemorrhagic blood products identified
within the right MCA infarct. No shift of normally midline
structures or evidence of new hemorrhage.
2. Right ventriculostomy catheter with the tip terminating in
the head of the right caudate, unchanged.

Echo [**2160-10-20**]
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The estimated cardiac index
is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-3-16**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is lower and
the severity of mitral rgurgitation is slightly higher.

[**2160-10-19**]
BRAIN MRI:
The diffusion images demonstrate an area of restricted diffusion
in the right middle cerebral artery indicative of an acute
infarct. There are blood products seen in the right subinsular
region indicative of hemorrhagic conversion of the infarct.
There is mild mass effect on the right lateral ventricle. There
are extensive changes of small vessel disease identified as
hyperintensities in the white matter. There is a right frontal
ventricular drain identified extending to the right lateral
ventricle. A defect in the left frontal bone could be related to
previous drain placement. The middle cerebral artery flow void
is not visualized distal to the M1 segment with some flow void
seen in the sylvian region.
IMPRESSION: Acute right MCA infarct with blood products
indicating hemorrhagic conversion. Mild mass effect on the right
lateral ventricle.  Extensive changes of small vessel disease as
described above. Other findings as described above.

MRA NECK:
Neck MRA demonstrates normal flow in the carotid and vertebral
arteries
without stenosis or occlusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the neck.

MRA HEAD:
Head MRA demonstrates occlusion of the M1 segment of the right
middle cerebral artery with some flow visualized distally,
likely collateral flow. The remaining arteries of the anterior
and the posterior circulation are well maintained.
IMPRESSION: Occlusion of the M1 segment of the right middle
cerebral artery with some distal flow likely due to collateral
circulation. Normal MRA otherwise.
