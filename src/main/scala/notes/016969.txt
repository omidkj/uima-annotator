Allergies:
sulfa or amoxicillin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R IJ placement

History of Present Illness:
87yo male w/ ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 45% s/p
PPM/AICD placement in [**2113**] for AV block, HTN, and possible
sarcoidosis who presents with two days of shortness of breath.
Presents with worsening breathing since yesterday. Family
reports a mechanical fall onto bottom yesterday. Has not been
altered since. Just worse breathing over course of 24-48 hours.
No fevers, chest pain or worsening pedal edema. Was at clinic
for foley placement with urology for urinary retention and noted
to be tachypneic, breathing in the 30s. Sent here for further
eval. Has been off of metoprolol b/c of hypotension.
.
He has had multiple recent admissions. On admission from [**1-13**] to
[**1-14**], patient presented with acute onset shortness of breath
with [**Month/Year (2) **] productive of whitish sputum without fever or
leukocytosis, felt to be consistent with bronchiectasis flare.
Sxs resolved overnight so pt was discharged on ciprofloxacin to
be completed on [**1-23**]. [**1-19**] to [**1-23**] he was admitted for hyopxia
that improved while on BiPAP. That time he was found to have a
DVT and was presumed to have a PE, started on lovenox bridge to
coumadin. Treated for PNA with vanc/cefepime, then levofloxacin.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.8 120 110/70 28 100% 10L.
Crackles at L lung base, mild wheeze. Afebrile. Portable CXR
looked okay. BNP up to 939. Pressures into 80s, responded to
500ccs of fluid. Tachycardic to 130s, down to 110 with fluid. UA
negative. Down to venti mask, dipped down to 90 with nasal
cannula. Ordered for vanc/Zosyn. Full code. Prior to transfer,
patient became hypotensive to the 80s. A CVL was placed, given
1L NS and started on Levophed. CTA looked like aspiration
pneumonia.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient denies pain. Per his wife he is
'not himself'. He is exasperated with being in the hospital.

Past Medical History:
bradycardia - with primary AV block s/p AICD and pacer placement
Recurrent urethral strictures [**12-29**] childhood infection

CTA CHEST WITH/WITHOUT RECONSTRUCTION ([**2119-2-1**]):
1. Peribronchovascular ground-glass and more consolidative
opacities in the left lower lobe are concerning for aspiration
pneumonitis/pneumonia.
2. Predominantly central bronchial wall thickening bilaterally
is likely related to chronic aspiration or bronchitis.
3. Stable right middle lobe pulmonary nodule, as described
above.
.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2119-2-4**]): There is a left-sided pacemaker with dual
leads, which is stable. There is a right IJ central venous line
with the distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction, stable.
There has been poor inspiration since the previous study, with
crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings. There is prominence
of the vasculature consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
There is a developing left retrocardiac opacity which may
represent areas of confluent edema versus developing
consolidation. Closer attention to this area is recommended on
subsequent exams.
.
EKG ([**2119-2-1**]): [**Month/Day/Year **] tachycardia at 125bpm with PR 196
.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
[**Month/Day/Year **] level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral
valve leaflets are elongated. There is mild bileaflet mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2119-1-23**], no major change.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo M with h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 45%) s/p PPM/AICD
placement in [**2113**] for AV block, HTN, and possible sarcoidosis
with h/o numerous recent admissions for dyspnea who was admitted
with dyspnea, hypoxemia and hypotension, found to have
pneumonia.
.
#.PNEUMONIA: patient with recurrent admissions for
hypoxemia/pneumonia over the past several months. Chest CT
revealed peribronchovascular ground-glass and more consolidative
opacities in the left lower lobe concerning for aspiration
pneumonitis/pneumonia. No pulmonary embolism detected. He was
initially treated with Vanco/Zosyn while in MICU, then narrowed
to Zosyn due to suspicion for aspiration pneumonia. He was then
further narrowed to PO Augmentin. Video swallow study showed
some risk for aspiration, but no aspiration events, making
aspiration pneumonia less likely. Given the above as well as
concern for possible Augmentin allergy (rash), antibiotic was
switched to Levoquin to cover for CAP. Although he is at risk
for HCAP, he remained afebrile with normal WBC count and
clinically improving on Levoquin. He will complete 7 day
antibiotic course. Of note, his oxygen sats were in the high 90s
on room air for the most part while on the floor, but he
desatted to 86% on ambulation and appeared more comfortable when
using 2L supplemental oxygen. Therefore he was discharged with
supplemental oxygen for comfort. He refused rehab placement, and
insisted on going [**Last Name (un) **].  He will receive home PT to address
