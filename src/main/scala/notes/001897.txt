Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]
Chief Complaint:
Hip fracture


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left hip hemiarthroplasty
Endotracheal Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation


History of Present Illness:
59yoM with a history of mitral valve prolapse, atrial
fibrillation s/p MAZE and mitral valvuloplasty in [**10/2171**] at [**Hospital1 112**]
that was complicated by a right MCA CVA, RLE DVT treated with
coumadin presenting status post fall during transfer and
fracture of his left hip.

Patient underwent arthroplasty of the left hip on [**2173-7-23**].
After the operation, he developed a new oxygen requirement and
was on 4L NC for the past 2 days until he was found to have a HR
of 140s on tele on [**2173-7-25**] at 1830 and an O2 sat of 71% on 4L NC.
 He was given 40mg IV lasix and 5mg IV lopressor, which was
repeated when heart rates did not decrease with another 5mg IV
lopressor.  He diuresed 1 L of urine and his oxygen saturations
increased to 100% on the non-rebreather.

On arrival to the MICU, O2 sats are 100% on non-rebreather and
patient has a new fever of 101.2.  Patient denies chest pain,
dyspnea, headache, or pleuritic pain.  He is only AAO x name,
and is unclear where he is or why he is here.  His family is
very involved in his care and were involved with this history
taking.



Past Medical History:
- [**2171-11-26**]: AFib and went to [**Hospital1 756**] were mitral
valvuloplasty/L atrial maze and L atrial appendage resection
were done. After this surgery on post-po day 1 he suffered a
long-standing post-op seizure tonic clonic and found on imaging
a R+ MCA CVA.
--- Pt reports that his Vimpat is being de-escalated and that he
hasn't had a seizure since his initial seizure.
- [**2172-1-13**]: pseudoaneurysm from R common femoral artery
(discovered after going to the hospital bc swelling of L+ ankle)
and DVT in R+ lower extremity.
- Mitral valve prolapse
- h/o DVT on Coumadin
- Bilateral inguinal hernia repair

[**7-23**] Path Gross:   The specimen is received fresh in a container
labeled with the patient's name, "[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname 43984**]", the medical
record number,   and additionally labeled "left femoral head".
It consists of a normally shaped femoral head without a portion
of femoral neck that measures 5.5 x 4.5 x 4.5 cm.  The articular
surface is unremarkable.  Osteophytes are not present.  The
femoral  neck margin is irregular.  The specimen is cut along
its length perpendicular to the articular cartilage.  The cut
surfaces reveal yellow-tan hemorrhagic cut surfaces.  A fragment
of femoral neck is also received in the container and measures
4.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm.  It is cut perpendicular to the articular
surface to reveal hemorrhagic bone marrow.  Tissue is not
present.  Representative sections of the specimen are submitted
for decalcification as follows:  A= representative sections of
femoral head, B = representative sections of femoral neck.

[**7-23**] ECG: Sinus bradycardia. Intraventricular conduction defect.
Left axis deviation, possibly due to left anterior fascicular
block. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to
tracing #1 the heart rate is decreased but there are no other
significant changes.

[**7-23**] Hip Xray:
FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the pelvis and three views of
the left hip were obtained.  a complete fracture of the left
femoral neck is present with mild varus angulation.  No
dislocation is identified.  Vague lucencies of the left femoral
shaft is suggestive of osteopenia.  No radiopaque foreign
bodies.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Left femoral neck fracture with mild varus angulation.
2.  Left femoral shaft lucencies suggestive of osteopenia in the
setting of decreased weght bearing from prior stroke.


[**7-23**] CXR: FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest compared
to previous exam from [**2172-3-20**].  The lungs are clear of
focal consolidation or effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
within normal limits.  Median sternotomy wires are again noted.
The osseous and soft tissue structures otherwise unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**7-25**] Knee xray
No prior studies for comparison.
FINDINGS:  Three views of the left knee demonstrate no evidence
of acute
fracture, dislocation, joint effusion, or soft tissue foreign
body.

[**7-25**] Cpine xrays
CERVICAL SPINE, [**2173-7-25**]

No prior studies for comparison.

On the lateral view, all seven cervical vertebral bodies are
visualized, but the superior aspect of T1 is obscured and cannot
be assessed.  Prevertebral soft tissue structures are within
normal limits.  Bone mineral density is apparently slightly
decreased throughout.  Multilevel degenerative changes are
present with small anterior osteophytes particularly at the C3
through C6 levels, as well as very minimal disc space narrowing.
 Reversal of the normal cervical lordosis is evident at C4-C5.
Flexion and extension views demonstrate no evidence of
instability.  Incidental note is made of an oval-shaped
calcification posterior to the spinous processes of C4 and C5,
which may represent ossification or calcification of the
posterior longitudinal ligament.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine as
described.  No acute fracture or dislocation identified, but CT
of the cervical spine is much more sensitive than conventional
radiographs for detecting traumatic abnormalities and would be
suggested if there is persistent clinical suspicion for a
cervical spine injury.
2.  Exam is limited by absence of an odontoid view and lack of
visualization of C7-T1 disc space and top of T-1.
