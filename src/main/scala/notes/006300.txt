Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58 year old female
patient with known aortic stenosis and aortic insufficiency.
Recent echocardiogram revealed a decreased in left
ventricular function and she was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
an aortic valve replacement.  On [**2139-10-1**], she underwent
cardiac catheterization which revealed normal coronary
arteries, [**3-3**]+ aortic regurgitation, mild to moderate aortic
stenosis and ejection fraction of 25%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Recent congestive heart failure admission to an outside
hospital.
2.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy approximately
twenty years ago.
3.  Status post cholecystectomy approximately fifteen years
ago.
4.  Status post back surgery times three including fusion
with rods placed.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Desipramine 50 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Quinine 325 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Zoloft 50 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Digitek 0.125 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. once daily.
8.  Zestril 5 mg p.o. once daily.
9.  Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. twice a day.
10. Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. twice a day.
11. Celebrex once daily.
12. Tylenol with Codeine two to four tablets per day as
needed for chronic complaints of back pain.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states an allergy to Sulfa which
causes itching and she claims that she is also lactose
intolerant.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her physical examination
preoperatively was unremarkable.

The patient did have a preoperative positive urinalysis for
which she was placed on three days of oral Ciprofloxacin
prior to her surgical procedure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2139-10-22**], where she was admitted directly to the preoperative
holding area.  She underwent an aortic valve replacement with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on that day with a #19mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] aortic
valve replacement.

Postoperatively, she was transported to the Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit in good condition.  She was later weaned from
mechanical ventilation and extubated on the day of surgery.
Due to what appeared to be vegetations on the valve found in
the operating room, an infectious disease consultation was
obtained although the patient had no fever or elevation in
white blood cell count.  Postoperatively, the patient was on
Dobutamine and Neo-Synephrine intravenous drip and these were
subsequently weaned off by postoperative day one in the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit.

The infectious disease consultation was obtained.  There were
recommendations for repeat blood culture as well as urine
culture, and everything has subsequently come back negative
with the exception of urine which was positive for
diphtheroids.  During her course of stay in the hospital, the
patient was empirically covered with Vancomycin and
Levofloxacin until the final culture of the aortic valve was
obtained and these antibiotics were discontinued this
morning.

The patient has progressed well from a physical therapy
standpoint.  She is ambulating independently.  She has had no
hemodynamic complications whatsoever.  She was begun on
Coumadin for her aortic valve replacement.  She is ready to
be discharged home today on [**2139-10-26**], on postoperative day
four.

Physical examination today is as follows:  The patient is
afebrile.  Neurologically, she is alert and oriented.  Her
lungs are clear.  Cardiac examination is regular rate and
rhythm, no murmur.  Her abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended.  She has no peripheral edema.

Most recent laboratory values include a white blood cell
count of 12.3, hematocrit 25.4, and a platelet count of
265,000.  Sodium 134, potassium 3.8, chloride 98, CO2 27,
blood urea nitrogen 18, creatinine 1.2, glucose 114.  Most
recent INR is 1.7 today for which she is to receive 5 mg of
Coumadin this evening.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets q3-4hours p.r.n. pain.
2.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Desipramine 50 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Warfarin 5 mg p.o. today [**2139-10-26**], and tomorrow [**2139-10-27**].
The patient is then to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3497**] in his office Wednesday
morning [**2139-10-28**], at 8:30 a.m. to have an INR drawn and his
office will be dosing her Coumadin.  Target INR for this
patient should be 2.5 to 3.0 for mechanical aortic valve.
5.  Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. once daily. This is for one week
for empiric coverage of her previously discussed infectious
disease issues as well as positive urinary tract infection.
6.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
7.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
8.  Quinine Sulfate 325 mg p.o. twice a day.
9.  Gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. twice a day.
10. Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. once daily.
11. Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. once daily.
12. Zoloft 50 mg p.o. once daily.

FOLLOW-UP:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately four weeks.  She is
also to follow-up with her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 3498**], in Renthem in two to three weeks.  She is also to
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3497**], also in Renthem, who will be dosing
her Coumadin in Dr.[**Name (NI) 3499**] office and she is following up
with him as previously stated the day after tomorrow,
[**2139-10-28**], for Coumadin dose.
