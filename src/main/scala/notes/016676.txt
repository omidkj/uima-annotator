Patient was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2133-1-17**] secondary
to c/o severe neck and back pain which he reports radiated up
the
back of his head while eating breakfast, he further stated that
he experienced weakness, and a low heart rate. Upon arrival to
the ER his HR was in the 40's, SBP in the 70's, no syncope.
Enzymes and Troponin were negative. Also of note, patient
experienced similar episode in [**2132-7-31**], although he reports
the
HA and neck pain during that episode was much worse, at that
time
he was admitted overnight and d/c'd the next day. During his
recent admission to [**Hospital1 1474**] of [**1-17**], pt underwent MRI/MRA of
the brain which was reported as negative, stress test on [**1-19**]
showed lg. MI involving the anterior wall and cardiac apex,
moderate dialation of the L ventricle, and mod area of ischemia
within the cardiac septum. Patient reports that he has had 4
MI's in the past and underwent a cardiac cath., without
intervention, at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital in the mid to late 80's.
Referred to [**Hospital1 **] for cardiac cath. On morning post-cath her
returned from echo with urgency and 2 large bloody BM. Found to
be hypotensive 70s/50s and LH. Pt transferred to CCU for
monitoring.

Cardiac Cath [**2133-1-21**]
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right
dominant system with two vessel coronary artery disease.  The
LMCA had
no angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease. The LAD had
heavy
calcifcation and diffuse disease.  There were serial 70-80%
stenoses at
D1 and D2.  Pressure wire interrogation of these lesions
demonstrated a
baseline FFR of 0.86, which decreased to 0.69 with maximal
hyperemia on
adenosine infusion.  These lesions were stented (see below).
There was mild disease in the diagonals, which were small.
The LCx had a focal mid-vessel 70% stenosis. This was stented
(see
below). The RCA had minimal luminal irregularities only and was
a large,
dominant vessel.
2.  Limited hemodynamics revealed normal aortic systolic and
diastolic
pressures.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed due to concerns about
the
patient's renal function.
4. Successful stenting of the mid LAD with two overlapping
Cypehr DESs
(2.5x28mm distally and 2.5x13mm proximally) (See PTCA comments).

5. Successful stenting of the mid LCX with a 3.0x23mm Cypher DES
(See
PTCA comments).

Cardiac Echo [**2133-1-22**]
LVEF 20%
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated.  Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.  Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include septal, anterior, and
apical akinesis (septum is thinned and echodense consistent with
scar). No apical thrombus seen but cannot exclude; views are
suboptimal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

EGD: Non bleeding healing duodeonal ulcers


Brief Hospital Course:
Post cath: Patient had GI bleed and hypotension, Pt transferred
to CCU for monitoring. GI bleed resolved after d/c of Integrilin
& coumadin. EGD showed non-bleeding doudenal ulcers. HCT
stabilized and patient transferred back to floor service on
[**1-23**]. On floor, pt had arthocentesis of knee that showed yellow
fluid with crystals found to be gout.
.
[**1-24**] 8PM pt found to be acutely sob w/ HR in the 100-130's. ECG
showed atrial fibrillation. He received 5 mg IV Lopressor x 2,
Diltiazem 10 mg IV x 2, nitropaste, and total 360 mg IV lasix.
Despite these interventions, pt had RR in 30s and HR 110-130's.
ABG 7.26/61/52 on 6L NC. He required mask ventilation to correct
hypoxemia. Pt put out 500 cc to Lasix. Due to concern of
possible PE, pt sent to CT, scan negative. Pt then started on
amiodarone drip w/ good rate control, transferred to CCU for
further monitoring.

## GI Bleed - After cath patient had two large bowel movements
with blood that resolved after integrillin and coumadin stopped.
 EGD showed healing duodenal ulcers.  H. Pylori was sent which
came back negative.  Patient was started on Protonix [**Hospital1 **] dose
for ulcers.  Since patient remained in chronic atrial fib he was
restarted on heparin and coumadin for anticoagulation.  While on
heparin and coumadin his Hct remained stable and did not have
any further GI bleeding.  Patient will need close follow up
outpatient with doctor to make sure INR not supratheraputic and
patient does not have reoccuring GI bleed.

.
## PNA - During hypoxic event at night patient spiked fever on
[**1-25**].  The CXR showed opacitiy suggestive of PNA.  Empirically
started treating for pneumonia with levofloxacin - started [**1-26**]
for 10 day course, therefore last day [**2133-2-1**].  Patient blood
cultures and urine cultures were negative.
.
## CAD- PAtient with cath intervention mentioned above.
Continued on aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor.  Once patient GI bleed
resolved started on beta-blocker and ACEI.  Patient on both
statin and fibrate on admission.  Held gemfibrozil while in
hospital since know documentation of why patient needed both
medications.  Continued statin.

## CHF - Felt that patient respiratory failure due to fluid
mobilization, especially after episode free s/p increasing
nightly lasix and increasing afterload reduction.  Felt that
tachycardia was secondary to respiratory distress and increased
heart rate not contributing to nightly respiratory failure.
Patient aggresively diuresed and remained symptom free.  Once
patient felt to be euvolemic kept on standing one time dose of
lasix.  Started patient on Lisinopril for afterload reducation.
Patient also kept on low dose digoxin.

## Rhythm - Patient remained in chronic a.fib while in hospital.
 Initially felt that patient's respiratory decompensation was
due to rapid A.fib; and goal was to cardiovert patient in
future.  Patient was thus loaded on amiodarone.  However once
discovered that respiratory hypoxia was
