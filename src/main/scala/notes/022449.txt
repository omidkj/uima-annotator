Pertinent Results:
Echo [**8-11**]: PRE-BYPASS: The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.

ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. POST CPB: Preserved biventricular
systolic function. Tri-leaflet bioprosthesis is visualized in
the aortic position. Mechanically stable and shows good leaflet
excursion. Trace AI. Intact aorta. No other change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Dr. [**Known lastname 1683**] was a same day admit and on [**2127-8-11**] he was brought to
the operating room where he underwent an Aortic Valve
Replacement. Please see op not for surgical details. He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on op day he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. He required multiple transfusions on both op day and
post-op day one. By post-op day two he was weaned off any
inotropes and was started on diuretics and beta blockers. He did
require aggressive diuresis initially and then was diuresed
towards his pre-op weight. Also on post-op day two his chest
tubes were removed. On post-op day three his epicardial pacing
wires were removed and he was transferred to the SDU. While on
the telemetry floor he continued to improve clinically. His
electrolytes were repleted and beta-blockers adjusted for
maximum bp/hr control. Physical therapy followed patient during
entire post-op course for strength and mobility. On post-op day
eight he appeared ready for discharge. Both his physical exam
and blood work were stable and he was discharged home with VNA
services and the appropriate follow-up appointments.
