Chief Complaint:
Fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
External pacemaker placement, right brachial [**2128-1-14**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 76-year-old gentleman with CAD, s/p quadruple [**Month/Day/Year 28750**]
in [**2106**], AV replacement, 2 stents, gout, prostate CA, AAA, afib
nd GI bleed in [**2124**] and [**9-23**] who presented to ED with fever to
103.9. The patient stated that he had felt well on the day prior
to admission. On the evening of [**1-6**], the patient had an acute
onset of episodic subjective fevers and rigors that prompted him
to seek care in the ED.

Initial temp in the ED was 104. Labs were notable for WBC count
of 15.7(97%N, no bands), HCT of 44 (baseline 30), platelets 149,
INR 2.7, Creatinine 1.5 from baseline of 1.1, mild
transaminitis, LDH of 460 and alk phos 195, lactate of 2.5. UA
was negative; blood cultures drawn. CXR unremarkable. Patient
given Vanc, Cefepime, Gentamycin with concern for endocarditis
given prior AVR. On transfer, 101.1 69 90/39 rechecked 107/48 RR
14 94% on RA.

On arrival to the floor, patient was in no acute distress and
appeared non toxic. In addition to the chills/rigors, he stated
that he had myalgias. Denies any Upper respiratory symptoms.
Reports lumbar back pain, that has been chronic for years. No
changes in his ambulatory status. No recent travel history or
sick contacts.

On review of systems, notable for absence of chest pain,
worsening dyspnea (has some on baseline), paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

ECHO [**2128-1-9**]:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection
velocity is depressed (<20 cm/s). Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There are simple
atheroma in the distal aortic arch and descending thoracic
aorta. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal disc
motion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or definite vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet
of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. An eccentric jet
of mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation is seen directed toward
the interatrial septum. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mitral leaflet thickening without definite discrete
vegetation or abscess. Eccentric jet of moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Extensive simple aortic atheroma.

[**2128-1-27**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
borderline normal free wall function. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but
cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. [The amount of regurgitation
present is normal for this prosthetic aortic valve.] The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis, especially on a
bileaflet aortic valve.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-1-8**],
the severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation has
increased. The right ventricular function may be slighlty less
vigorous.

Liver U/S [**2128-1-9**]:
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver is homogeneous in
echotexture
without evidence of a focal liver lesion. There is no
intrahepatic biliary
ductal dilatation, and the common bile duct measures 4 mm. The
main portal
vein is patent, with antegrade flow. The head and neck of the
pancreas are
unremarkable, but the distal pancreas is not visualized due to
bowel gas.
The gallbladder demonstrates multiple shadowing stones, but
there was no
[**Doctor Last Name **] sign, gallbladder wall thickening, or pericholecystic
fluid. The
gallbladder is overall not largely dilated.
IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without definite evid
