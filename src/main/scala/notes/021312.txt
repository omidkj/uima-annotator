CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: airspace disease? atelectatsis?

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old man with PEEP of 10, then bedside trach placement
today, now with sats of 90-92 (worse than prior when on
endotracheal tube). ? atelectasis.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
airspace disease? atelectatsis?
EXAMINATION: AP chest.

INDICATION: Hypoxia.

A single AP view of the chest was obtained on [**2108-7-13**] at 1245
hours and is compared with the radiograph performed the prior
evening at [**2126**] hours. The patient has had removal of an ET tube
and a tracheostomy placed. When allowing for technical
differences there likely has been no significant change in the
appearance of the chronic pulmonary disease together with
superimposed mild interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural
effusions.

IMPRESSION:

Stable appearance to the chest following tracheostomy.

[**7-9**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is [**6-14**]
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber
size is milldy
increased with normal free wall motion. The aortic valve is not
well seen.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral
valve is not well seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was transferred to the TSICU once stabilized in the ED and
admitted to the Trauma Service. Neurosurgery was consulted
because of his subarachnoid hemorrhage; the injury was non
operative. Serial head CT scans were followed and were stable.
He remained in the TSICU and initially was difficult to wean
from the ventilator; the decision to perform a tracheostomy and
placement of a PEG tube was made. He underwent both procedures
without any complications. He was eventually weaned from the
ventilator.

Because of his head injury there were initially some behavioral
problems; complicating this was his history of EtOH use. He was
placed on a CIWA protocol for alcohol withdrawal, this was
discontinued after 9 days. Haldol was started to help control
his intermittent episodes of agitation; this was found to be
very helpful. His mental status and behavior improved over the
next several days.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have
recommended rehab after hospital stay. He will need a Speech and
Swallow evaluation once at rehab for Passy Muir and swallowing
eval.

He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Clinic in [**3-10**] weeks for
possible removal of his trach and PEG if he passes the Speech
and Swallow evaluation.
