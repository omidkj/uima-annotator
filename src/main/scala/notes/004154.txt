Brief Hospital Course:


The patient was maintained on phenylephrine, which was started
in the ED, until her son and daughter-in-law arrived for a
family meeting and to spend some time with her.  The patient's
son, who is her health care proxy, expressed that the patient
would choose to have Comfort Measures Only if she could make the
decision for herself.  She was started on an IV morphine drip,
titrated to comfort.  The phenylephrine was stopped in the late
evening on [**11-17**].  Her blood pressure dropped quickly to the 40s
systolic and MAPs in the mid 40s, where she remained until about
6am.  The patient was saturating 100% on a non-rebreather; her
respiratory rate slowly decreased.  She passed at 7:05AM on
[**2196-11-18**] with no heart beating on the telemetry. The patient was
examined at that time with her daughter-in-law at the bedside.
The patient's son declined post-mortem autopsy.
