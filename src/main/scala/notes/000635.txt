EGD: A single non-bleeding localized erosion was seen in the
second part of the duodenum adjacent to the G tube balloon. A
single acute cratered 8mm ulcer was found in the apex of the
duodenum with an adherent clot suggesting recent bleeding. A
total of 4 cc Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] injections were applied to the
base and on the clot of the ulcer for hemostasis with success.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was also applied for hemostasis
successfully. In addition, a single Hemoclip was also applied
for hemostasis successfully.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 68 yo M w/ MMP including CAD, s/p MI w/ EF 20%, PVD s/p
stents on [**2-27**], colon CA, who presents w/ melena and 10 pt Hct
drop over 24 hours, while on [**Month/Year (2) **], [**Month/Year (2) **], plavix. lovenox. Pt
required 8U PRBC, 4U FFP and one bag of platelets.  Give
persistant GI bleeding and falling hematocrit, Mr. [**Known lastname 19755**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8783**]t an urgent EGD.  Given his history of laryngeal cancer
s/p XRT, he was electively intubated prior to the EGD.  The EGD
revealed erosion at the site of the insertion of the G tube at
the second portion of the duodenum (the G tube had advanced into
the duodenum) and another erosion with a blood clot.  Both
ulcers were injected with epinephrine.  A clip was applied at
the base of the ulcer with clot.
.
After the EGD, Mr. [**Known lastname 71861**] hematocrit remained stable at 36
and he was extubated successfully on HD #2.
.
Per discussion with the patient's primary care physician,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will not be restarted.  Aspirin and clopidogrel may be
reinstituted, probably ~7 days from discharge, in concert with
recommendations from Mr. [**Known lastname 71861**] primary care physician and
[**Known lastname 1106**] surgeon.
.
Surgery was consulted regarding the G-tube.  They repositioned
and re-secured the G-tube.  A G tube study was obtained that
demonstrated appropriate filling of the stomach and tube feeds
were restarted.  After confirming with the rehabilitation center
Mr. [**Known lastname 19755**] was previously cared for at, he was restarted on
a heart healthy, diet.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 71861**] creatinine was initially elevated above his
baseline in the setting of hypovolemia, but returned to baseline
after appropriate resuscitation with blood products.
.
Patient had 2 episodes of 14 and 18 beat VT on [**2131-3-10**]. Vital
signs were otherwise stable. We replaced his electrolytes to
keep his potassium > 4.0 and his magnesium >2.0. He will follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2077**] on [**2131-3-15**].
