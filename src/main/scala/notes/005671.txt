Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4611**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Change of nephrostomy tube

History of Present Illness:
51 year old male with metastatic gastric cancer s/p 6 cycles of
ECX, history of small PE dx'd 6 weeks ago on Lovenox, ureteral
obstruction s/p perc nephrostomy tube placement, bowel
obstructions necesitating home TPN, and pleural effusion drained
on [**2191-8-8**] who presents with worsening shortness of breath x3
days.  Was seen in clinic 2 days prior to admission and CXR
obtained for dyspnea and decreased breath sounds in right base,
which showed reaccumulation right sided pleural effusion.  His
oncologist spoke w IR re: drainage, however they felt there was
not enough fluid to drain and was unlikely the cause of his
shortness of breath.  Has also been having decreased output from
nephrostomy tube, so this was replaced on [**2191-9-15**].  Per his
wife, the patient has been continuing to have signficant
shortness of breath and DOE at home, so his oncologist
instructed him to come to the ED for possible US-guided [**Female First Name (un) 576**]
and due to concern for possible recurrent PE or lymphagitic
spread of cancer.

In the ED, initial VS: 98.6 125 122/77 18 96% RA.  CXR showed
persistent right sided effusion, labs revealed acute renal
failure with Cr to 2.3 from 1.0.  Given his tachycardia and
acute worsening of shortness of breath, MDs were concerned about
recurrent PE. Spoke with his oncologist, who recommended
starting heparin gtt.  While in the ED, also had singificant
agonizing pain from bladder spasming while trying to urinate, so
was given lorazepam 1mg IV and dilaudid 1mg x2.  Given
levofloxacin and ceftriaxone for possible underlying pneumonia,
and given 5L NS for fluid resucitation prior to transfer to the
MICU.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is sleepy and a little bit
confused due to meds given in the ED.  Breathing is a little
labored but not tachypneic.  Still having [**5-8**] abdominal pain
due to bladder spasm and obstruction, feels like he needs to
void.  Does endorse a chronic cough over the past 6 weeks
occasionally productive of yellow, sometimes "muddy" sputum.

[**2191-9-17**] RENAL ULTRASOUND:
FINDINGS:  There is no hydronephrosis on the right kidney.  The
right percutaneous nephrostomy tube is seen in place.  There is
slight increase in hydronephrosis of the left compared to study
on [**2191-8-25**] from mild to now mild-to-moderate.  The
bladder is distended measuring 12.3 x 10.6 x 10.6 cm.  There is
adjacent ascites in the abdomen.

LE DOPPLER [**2191-9-17**]:
FINDINGS:  There is normal phasicity in the common femoral veins
bilaterally. There is normal compression and augmentation of
common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior
tibial, and peroneal veins of the right and left leg

ECG [**2191-9-23**]:
Supraventricular tachycardia, probably sinus. Otherwise, normal
ECG. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2191-9-16**] no significant
change except for faster rate.

CXR [**2191-9-25**]:
Large right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Left lower lobe
opacities have minimally increased consistent with minimally
increased atelectases and small left effusion.  Cardiac size is
top normal.  Widened mediastinum due to lymphadenopathy.
Port-A-Cath is in standard position.  Drain projects in the
right upper quadrant.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 year old male with metastatic gastric cancer s/p 6 cycles of
ECX, history of small PE dx'd 6 weeks ago on Lovenox, ureteral
obstruction s/p perc nephrostomy tube placement, bowel
obstructions necesitating home TPN, and pleural effusion drained
on [**2191-8-8**] who presents with worsening shortness of breath x3
days, found to be tachycardic with new O2 requirement.

# Dyspnea, hypoxia:  Possible etiologies include PE, PNA,
worsening pleural effusion, or perhaps pericarditis due to
malignancy.  PE was a concerning possibility especially in light
of his accelerated sinus tachycardia, acute O2 requirement, PE 6
weeks prior to presentation and active malignancy.  He was
already on lovenox but is not always compliant with the
scheduled [**Hospital1 **] dosing. He was not a good candidate for tPA given
active metastatic malignancy, and no active hemodynamic
instability.  PNA was also a possibility, given hi
