Chest Pain

Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 22656**] is an 85 year-old man with a history of hypertension
and coronary artery disease who presented with angina, now being
transferred to the CCU after bieng found to have left main
coronary artery disease.

Six months prior to admission, began experiencing
"palpatations", described as chest pressure over the left
nipple. It would occur in the morning and occasionally
throughout the day and would be worsened by his morning weight
lifting. Each episode would last ~5-10 minutes. They were not
associated with SOB, diapheresis or nausea. He contact[**Name (NI) **] his PCP
he referred him to a cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. A stress MIBI was
performed and reportedly positive per the patient though we do
not have the report. He was then prescribed SL nitro which he
took twice daily, with or without symptoms though he does
believe that taking it with symptoms did help.

Four months ago he underwent cataract surgery, at which time he
stopped aspirin. The surgery was uneventful.

Three months prio to admission, the angina resolved and he ran
out of nitro. Two weeks prior to admission he stopped aspirin in
preparation for spinal stenosis surgery. Five days prior to
admission, he again began to experience palpatations. He was in
[**State 108**] for his surgery and, upon describing his symptoms to the
anesthiologist, was cancelled. He flew back to [**Location (un) 86**] on [**11-13**]
and called his PCP who referred him to the ED for further
evaluation.

In the ED VSS, EKG showed old LBBB per his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] CP resolved
with SL NTG x1. He was given ASA 325mg and started on a heparin
gtt.

Overnight, he was continued on nitro and heparin gtts and had
stuttering chest pain. On the morning of transfer he was loaded
with Plavix 600mg and sent for cardiac cath where he was found
to have a 80% ulcerated left main lesion.

Imaging/Studies:

CXR - 1.2 cm nodular opacity in the left upper lung zone,
concerning
for lung mass. Followup imaging is recommended.

ECG - Sinus rhythm with a first degree A-V block. Old left
bundle-branch block.

ECHO - The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%), mostly secondary
to left bundle branch block-related septal motion. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with borderline global systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.

CT head w/o - IMPRESSION: Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation in the medial right frontal lobe, MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4639**]n-weighted imaging is recommended to rule out acute
infarction.

MRI/A head:
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute right anterior cerebral artery territorial infarct.
2. Tiny small areas of slow diffusion in the right parietal,
right medial
occipital, left parietal and the left frontal regions indicate
multiple small infarcts, which could be embolic in nature.

MRA OF THE HEAD:
Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation.

IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.

Brief Hospital Course:
85M presenting with chest pain admitted initially to cardiology
service.  Patient continued to have chest pain and underwent
emergent catheterization and found to have left main disease. He
was transferred to the CCU to await CABG, but had a R ACA stroke
and CBAG was deferred. He was discharged to rehab in stable
condition.

# Coronary Artery Disease: Initially presented with concern for
unstable angina; ruled out by cardiac enzymes; ECG was difficult
to interpret in setting of LBBB. Medically managed overnight
with heparin gtt, nitro gtt, ASA, BB, statin. Caridac cath on
[**11-14**] showed LMCA ulcerated lesion of 70% and tortuous aorta.
Given LMCA lesion and its nature, patient was transferred to CCU
for further observation prior to possible CABG. He was continued
on ASA, heparin gtt and metoprolol and high dose statin. Nitro
gtt was started to maintain patient
