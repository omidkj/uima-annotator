History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 30279**] is a 75 yo right handed woman with an extensive
cardiac history including mechanical mitral valve presenting for
evaluation of a cerebellar hemorrhage.

The patient reports that yesterday afternoon she began to
develop
a constant, aching pain in the back of her head.  Over the
course
of the evening she had progressive nausea and vomiting/dry
heaves
which prompted her evaluation at [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital.  On arrival
there, the vitals were T 97.8, Pulse 55, RR 17, BP 117/42.  Chem
7 was normal, INR 2.5. A CT of the head was obtained and was
notable for a left cerebellar hemorrhage. The patient was
transferred here for further evaluation and treatment.

Of note, the patient was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital 8641**]
hospital
for 8 days.  She states she went there due to feelings of
chills,
shivering.  She was also nauseated and thought perhaps she had a
urinary tract infaction as her urine was dark. She reports that
there was concern for CHF exacerbation and she was placed on
bipap.  She was also treated with antibiotics, but she is not
sure which or for what type of infection.  She was apparently
briefly on bipap. While hospitalized, her INR was subtherapeutic
and she was placed on a lovenox bridge.

Other than the symptoms above, the patient denies any slurred
speech, difficulty swalling, incoordination. She has felt
imbalanced when walking intermittently since her headache began.
She denies any new double vision but reports for the

On neurologic review of systems, the patient reports [**3-21**] ache
over her occiput.  She has no loss of vision, vertigo, tinnitus
or hearing difficulty. Denied focal weakness, numbness,
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.

On general review of systems, the patient denied fever or
chills.
She has no cough, shortness of breath.  Denied chest pain or
tightness, palpitations.  She notes rapid breathing but she is
also anxious. She continues to be nauseated and has dry mouth.
She also reports mild diffuse abdominal discomfort. She has no
change in bowel or bladder habits.  No dysuria.
