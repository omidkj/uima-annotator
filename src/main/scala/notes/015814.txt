   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2140-7-19**] 3:18 PM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 150CC NONIONIC CONTRAST

Reason: evaluate for PE
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
71 year old man with acute SOB
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Acute shortness of breath, evaluate for pulmonary
embolism.

COMPARISON: [**2140-5-25**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images of the chest were obtained
with and without IV contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images
were also displayed.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The pulmonary
arteries appear opacified without evidence of pulmonary
embolism. Again seen is marked architectural distortion
throughout both lungs, predominantly the upper and mid lung
zones with dense fibrotic changes and volume loss consistent
with pulmonary fibrosis, by report, likely secondary to
sarcoidosis. Again seen is elevation of both hila. The
previously seen small left-sided pneumothorax appears to have
resolved. Several parenchymal and pleural-based nodular
opacities are again seen. Compared to prior study, there does
appear to be some increase in poorly defined opacities
distributed throughout the left lung, concerning for
superimposed infection. Again seen are enlarged mediastinal and
hilar lymph nodes, many of which appear calcified, not
significantly changed from prior study. Limited views of the
upper abdomen appear unremarkable.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are
identified.

Multiplanar reformatted images confirm the axial findings.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. New scattered foci of poorly defined opacities seen
predominantly within the left lung, concerning for superimposed
multifocal pneumonia.
3. Extensive fibrotic and architectural distortion within both
lungs, not significantly changed from prior study, consistent
with history of pulmonary fibrosis.
4. Interval improvement of small left-sided pneumothorax.

Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1923**] following completion of study.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
