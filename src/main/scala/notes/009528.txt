Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia s/p intubation for Hip replacement


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
total right hip replacement


History of Present Illness:
72 M with Parkinson's Disease, h/o prostate CA s/p prostatectomy
and urostomy with multiple revisions, and severe OA admitted for
right total hip replacement by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. After non-traumatic
easy intubation, he became hypoxic. He was suctioned and a large
mucous plug was removed. Then further suctioning recovered green
thick sputum which was sent for gram stain.  The surgery was
called off and the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] because
the aneasthesiologist did not feel he would be able to be
extubated.
.
On arrival to ICU, VS: T 95.6 HR 85 BP 135/76 RR 16 O2 98% on
PSV 10/5, FiO2 0.6. The ETT was noted to be further out of his
mouth at 19 instead of 21cm. CXR showed that ETT high up, likely
above vocal cords. Pt also noted to be difficult to ventilate,
not getting significant tidal volumes. Propofol was discontinued
and pt awoke quickly. He was extubated with good oxygen
saturations on face mask.

Past Medical History:

Social History:
Bedridden for past 4 months secondary to wrist fracture,
Parkinson's Disease and OA. Has been living at home with wife as

CXR [**2187-5-29**]:
1. Endotracheal tube is above the level of the thoracic inlet
and should be advanced.
2. Progression of opacity within the right upper lobe medially
suggestive of volume loss and consolidation.
3. Increase in prominence of the interstitial markings may
relate to volume overload versus congestive heart failure.
4. Asymmetric biapical pleural densities, more prominent on the
right, may
possibly relate to chronic lung disease with a potential
additional component of volume loss and consolidation on the
present examination, and could be further evaluated with CT of
the chest if comparison prior chest x-rays are unavailable.
.
CXR [**2187-5-30**]: Mild pulmonary edema appears approximately
unchanged.
.
EKG: pre op [**5-18**]: sinus tach 100 nl axis, no Q waves, no ST
segment changes.
.
[**6-1**] Echo
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are  normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxia: The most likely cause was pneumonia [**12-20**] mucus plug,
given his CXR, relative hypoxia, clinical exam, and sputum
production. However, not febrile and no leukocytosis. His sputum
gram stain shows G+C in pairs, [**9-11**] poly, <10 epi good sample.
Culture grew oropharyngeal flora. Given one dose of vancomycin
and then was started on levaquin and clindamycin for presumed
aspiration pna. Speech and swallow evaluation was performed and
they felt that pt was not an aspiration risk, so aspiration
pneumonia was less likely.  Repeated CXR on [**6-1**] which was much
improved.  Completed clinda x 7 day course.
.
2. Diarrhea: Has intermittent episodes of diarrhea. He was
started on Flagyl. However C.Diff. stool was negative and
diarrheal episodes improved and so flagyl was discontinued. Was
on Lomotil prn for any episodes of diarrhea.
.
3. Osteo Arthritis: He had a total hip replacement surgery on
[**6-9**]. Surgery went off well without any complications. His HCT
dropped from 36.7 on day of [**Doctor First Name **] ([**6-9**]) to 26.6 on [**6-12**]. He
received a unit of PRBC on [**6-12**]. His HCT on [**6-13**] was 28.6.
Ortho was consulted-per ORtho, it was not unusual to have upto
10 pt HCT drop post hip replacement surgery. They were
confortable discharging him around a HCT of 28-29. His vitals
were stable on [**6-13**] (BP-110/60; HR-93; RR-18; O2sat-97/RA).
.
4. Delirium/Confusion-Pt was delirious on [**7-31**]. most
likely [**12-20**] taking percocet (past h/o delirium on taking
percocet). Percocet was stopped and was put on Vicodin on
discharge.
.
5. Other conditions: Outside meds for Parkinson's, Depression
and Psoriasis were continuted during this hospital stay.
