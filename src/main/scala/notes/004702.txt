Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 M w CAD s/p CABG x 2, CHF EF 30%, h/o Vtach
s/p ablation, CRI, and severe COPD with home 2.5L O2 discharged
earlier today, who was readmitted s/p fall.
.
The patient was found to have hyperkalemia in the ED, where he
was given Kayexelate, calcium, and gluconate.  The patient
remained stable overnight.  On the morning of [**2145-5-9**], the
patient developed VTach.  Given the fact that the patient was
DNR/DNI, he was given IV Amiodarone in an attempt to break the
rhythm.  The patient's son was called, who confirmed the fact
that the patient was DNR/DNI.  The patient ultimately became
unresponsive and expired 10 minutes later.  The patient's family
was informed and an autopsy was declined.  The case was reported
to the medical examiner's office, who also declined an autopsy.
