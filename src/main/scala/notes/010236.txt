History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11060**] is a 43 year old man with h/o CKD (unknown baseline
Cr), who was admitted with epidural abscess.

The patient had a 1 week h/o back pain ([**5-12**]) on the left side
that radiated down to his left ankle. He presented to the
[**Hospital1 882**] ED at that time and was discharged on Ibuprofen and
Flexeril, with a likely diagnosis of sciatica. He then presented
to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital 2 days later and was again discharged with
pain medications. The pain worsened during the week to the point
where the patient was having difficulty with ambulation and
getting out of bed. The patient was seen by his PCP the day
prior to admission and had an MRI, which was indeterminate [**1-28**]
to artifact. The PCP urged the patient to come to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation. The patient took 3 Tramadol and 4 Percocet
this AM prior to presentation. The wife noted that he was more
lethargic and was incoherent at times over the past day.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 96.9 P 87 BP 84/38 RR 10 O2 95%.
He was found to have LLE weakness and decreased rectal tone on
exam. He was hypotensive to the 80s and received 3LNS. Labs were
notable for Cr 6.0 (unknown baseline). Pt received Ativan prior
to MRI, which showed e/o epidural abscess. Patient was given
Ceftriaxone, Vanc, and Zosyn, has not received Flagyl yet at
this time. He was evaluated by neurosurgery, who was unable to
take the patient straight to the OR given his renal failure.

On the floor, the patient was lethargic, but arousable and
answering appropriately. He has pain in his right shoulder with
movement and some pain in his left lower back. He notes that he
has not had any urine output all day. No fevers or chills at
home, but the pt does endorse having sweats. Wife and daughter
with colds at home, but developed them after the patient's back
pain had already started. No recent travel or h/o IVDU.

STUDIES:
[**5-20**] EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Prominent QRS voltage suggests left ventricular
hypertrophy, although is non-diagnostic and tracing may be
within normal limits.

[**5-20**] CXR: Low inspiratory lung volumes with probable left
basilar atelectasis.

[**5-20**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1093**]:
1. The findings suggest a 3-cm posterior epidural space
occupying lesions
centered at L3-4 resulting in severe canal narrowing with
moderate intrathecal crowding. Assessment is limited due to lack
of IV contrast administration, and this can be seen with
infection with or without hemorrhage, the latter component being
a possibility due to small foci of increased T1W signal. TO
correlate with labs and clinically and consider spine/NS
consult. Intradural extension cannot be excluded as the dura is
not clearly identifiable on the axial T2W images. Mass lesion is
less likely; however cannot be completely excluded given the
dark T2 siganl and lack of IV contrast. There are small fluid
collections throughout the left posterior paraspinal musculature
extending anteriorly into the left iliopsoas muscle. Follow up
if no intervention is contemplated. No bone marrow signal
abnormalities to sug
