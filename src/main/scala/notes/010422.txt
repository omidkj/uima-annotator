Chief Complaint:
Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2138-10-15**] Right craniotomy temporal lobectomy and resection of
mass


History of Present Illness:
59 RHM with hypothyroidism and asthma presents following a
seizure and minor motor vehicle accident and found to have right
temporal mass on CT and neurosurgery consulted regarding
management.

Patient was drowsy on assessment and at times would close his
eyes but still continue conversation. Patient has been in his
usual state of health on [**2138-10-11**] and indeed went for a 3 mile
run. At around 2pm, he was taking shopping back from CostCo when
he [**Location 91587**] and per report drove across empty lanes
across the road and came to rest at a mailbox and latterly
before
a stone wall. Patient was not travelling at high speed, air bag
was not deployed and patient had no injuries from this. Car was
minimally damanged and wife was able to drive home. he next
thing
he remenbres was waking up in [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital. He had
not
been incontinent of urine but had bitten his tongue. It was
unclear whether he had convuslions at the time. He was
post-ictal
with drowsiness and confusion post seizure. CT there showed
right
temporal hypodensity with edema and minimal midline shift. He
was
given IV keppra 500mg and Dexamethasone 10mg IV and lorazepam
1mg
IV x2. He was transferred for neurosurgical assessment.

On assessment, patient is verbalising well but repeatedly
blinking and at times closing eyes.

Pertinent Results:
[**2138-10-12**] MRI brain with and without contrast:
IMPRESSION:
A heterogeneous lesion in the right temporal lobe measuring
approximately
5.3 x 3.0 cm with heterogeneous nodular peripheral enhancement,
moderate
surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect on the right lateral
ventricle. Possibilities include a primary neoplasm such as a
glial tumor-GBM or a metastatic lesion; less likely lymphoma,
etc.

[**2138-10-12**]: CT chest/Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of primary malignancy within the chest or
abdomen.
2. Tiny low-density lesion within the pancreatic head is not
concerning for pancreatic adenocarcinoma; it may represent a
cystic lesion or interdigitating fat. An MRCP is recommended on
a non-urgent basis within 6 months to evaluate for an incidental
cystic pancreatic lesion.
3. Small Bochdalek hernia.

[**10-13**]: Functional MRI and MR Spect
Successful functional MRI of the brain, demonstrating the
expected activation areas in the cerebral cortex during the
movement of the hands, feet, language, and during the movement
of the tongue. No significant activation areas are adjacent to
the right temporal mass lesion, which is unchanged since the
most recent study. The ASL sequence demonstrates no significant
perfusion. The spectroscopy indicates elevated ratio for Choline
medially, suggesting malignancy, either primary or metastatic.

[**10-15**]: MRI IMPRESSION: Relatively stable and unchanged right
temporal intra-axial mass lesion with ring-enhancing pattern and
necrosis and also associated vasogenic edema, causing mild
effacement of the right perimesencephalic cistern as described
above. No new lesions are identified in the interval.

[**10-15**] CT Head- IMPRESSION: Immediately status post right
temproparietal craniotomy, with post-surgical changes but no
evidence of acute complication.

[**10-16**] MRI Brain- Post op changes, enhancement along surgical bed
consistent with surgical changes.  No acute infarct or
hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 78697**] was admitted to the Neurosurgery service for workup of
right temporal brain lesion.  He was started on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **]
for seizure prophylaxis and dexamethasone for cerebral edema.
He underwent MRI brain to better evaluate the lesion.  CT of the
chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed to rule out primary
malignancy.  Neuro- oncology and radiation oncology were
consulted.  After discussion with patient and wife the decision
was made to plan for craniotomy for resection of the lesion.

On [**2138-10-13**] he underwent functional MRI testing that
demonstrated the expected activation areas in the cerebral
cortex during the movement of the hands, feet, language, and
during the movement of the tongue. No significant activation
areas are adjacent to the right temporal mass lesion.
On [**10-15**] He went to the OR and underwent a craniotomy and
temporal lobectomy for resection of tumor. Surgery was without
complication. He was extubated and transferred to the ICU for
close neuro observation. Post op head CT revealed post operative
changes and no hemorrhage.
On [**10-16**] he was neurologically well. He was cleared for transfer
to the floor, foley was discontinued and activity/diet were
advanced.
Now DOD, pt is afebrile, VSS, and neurologically intact.  His
incision is clean/dry and intact.  He is ambulating without
issues and tolerating a good oral diet.  He is set for discharge
home in stable.
