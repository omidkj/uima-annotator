Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV
cavity. No LV aneurysm. Moderate-severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Focal calcifications in aortic arch. Normal descending
aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate ([**11-22**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild to moderate [[**11-22**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient is in a
ventricularly paced rhythm. Results were personally reviewed
with the MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for
post-bypass data The post-bypass study was performed while the
patient was receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for
listing of medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:

The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. No
left ventricular aneurysm is seen. There is moderate to severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 30
%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post Bypass:

The patient is V-paced and on an infusion of epinephrine and
phenylephrine. Left and right ventricular function is preserved.
An aortic valve bioprosthesis is well seated with good leaflet
motion. There is no AI. The mean gradient across the aortic
valve is approximately 10 mmHg. The aorta is intact without
evidence of dissection. The remainder of the study is unchanged.


Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on Mr.[**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 11AM

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including XXXX.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 82 year old gentleman with a history of aortic
stenosis.  On echo he was found to have moderate to severe AS
with an aortic valve area of 0.6cm2, mean gradient 37mmHg, and
peak gradient 67mmHg.  Coronary arteries were clean on
angiography.  He was brought to the operating room on
[**2114-10-1**], where he underwent aortic valve replacement with a
23mm [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial bioprosthesis.  For further details,
please see operative report.  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for observation and recovery.  At this time
he was on milrinone and epinephrine to maintain adequate
hemodynamics.  By POD 1 the patient was extubated, alert and
oriented and breathing comfortably.  Drips were weaned as
tolerated.  He did develop some post-operative confusion, for
which narcotics were discontinued.  Zyprexa and haldol were
given as needed.  Permanent pacemaker was interrogated and
temporary pacing wires were discontinued.  Chest tubes were
removed without complication.  The patient was transferred to
the step down unit on POD 7.  The same day he passed speech and
swallow and diet was
