Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 y/o russian speaking male with PMH of CAD s/p CABG
with CHF (EF 35%), afib on coumadin, CKD (baseline Cr 2.2) who
now presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with hypoxia and respiratory
distress.
.
Per records, pt was on treatment for a pneumonia, started on CTX
on [**10-1**] for a 7day course.  At 4am today, pt was noted to be in
respiratory distress and hypoxic to 86% on 2L NC.  Pt was using
accessory muscles for breathing.  Was give 10mg Lasix IV.  EMS
was called.  EMS started the patient on noninvasive positive
pressure ventilation.  Also, treated pt with SL nitroglycerin as
he was complaining of chest pain.  Of note, pt was on NC at
[**Hospital 100**] rehab since last week bc of the pneumonia.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.3 HR 69 BP 120/p RR 25 O2 sat
99% CPAP. Patient triggered on arrival for respiration on
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Labs revealed Cr
3.3, Lactate 2.5, Hct 27.  proBNP was >9000 and TnT was 0.24.
He underwent bedside u/s which showed b/l pleural effusions,
poor heart squeeze and a non collapsing IVC. CXR showed evidence
of volume overload w/ bilateral blunting of the costophrenic
angles. Patient received 40 mg lasix IV and aspirin 600 mg PR.
Pt briefly placed on nitroglycerin gtt, however, did not
tolerate it well with borderline blood pressures so it was dc'd.
 Pt was given Vancomycin and Cefepime for HCAP. She was
transferred to the ICU for further management. VS on transfer
were: T 97.3, HR 91, BP 108/61, RR 27, O2 sat 97% NIPPV.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt is resting in bed, appears
comfortable.  Denies pain.  Unable to communicate due to
fatigue, sleepiness.  Also, [**3-12**] language barrier.

CXR ([**10-5**]):
1. Bibasilar opacities with bibasilar consolidations, likely
reflecting
components of atelectasis and pleural effusion, although
underlying infection cannot be excluded - post-diuresis
radiograph may be considered to further assess.
2. Cardiomegaly and perihilar opacities compatible with
pulmonary edema
secondary to heart failure.

CXR ([**10-6**]):
Improved aeration of the lungs compared to [**10-5**] am. Stable
cardiomegally.
Small left pleural effusion.

Echo ([**10-6**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior and infero-lateral akinesis, The distal septum and
septal apex are hypokinetic. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline
normal free wall function. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 74 y/o russian speaking male with PMH of CAD s/p CABG
with CHF (EF 35%), afib on coumadin, CKD (baseline Cr 2.2) who
now presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with hypoxia and respiratory
distress.
.
Active Issues:
# Hypoxia/respiratory distress and CHF:  diff is broad but
likely [**3-12**] acute CHF exacerbation.
Patient doing much better after IV lasix with approximately 2-3L
net negative output. No clear source of infection as to why
patient had acute CHF exacerbation; infectious workup negative.
Continued supportive O2 with NC and face mask. Echo showed
worsening MR (3+), pulmonary HTN, and EF of 35%. Continued home
Ipratropium nebs as needed. Patient was evaluated by
speech/swallow and thought to be at risk for aspiration but we
discussed at length with wife about goals of care and she wants
him to be comfortable and eat if he's hungry. We placed him on a
soft, honey thickened diet.
-on [**2166-10-7**] given total of 80mg IV lasix with -2.5 L net output.
Continues to have bibasilar crackles and will need to be
frequently reassessed.
-Goal negative 1-2 L/day
- Recommend transition to regular oral diuretic regimen
- Recommend beginning an afterload reducing regimen for crhonic
management of heart failure
