H. pylori antibody test ([**7-18**]): Positive by EIA

EKG: Sinus rhythm. Mild Q-T interval prolongation. Probable left
atrial
abnormality. Cannot exclude prior anteroseptal myocardial
infarction.
Anterolateral ST-T wave changes. Clinical correlation is
suggested.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2140-7-8**] ST segment
depressions are more
prominent in the high lateral leads and the rate is faster.

Pertinent imaging:

Echo ([**2140-7-18**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal half of the
septum and anterior walls and apex. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution).

Upper extremity doppler ([**7-20**]): official result pending


Brief Hospital Course:
57 y/o male with hx ESRD with melanotic stools since starting
dialysis. On plavix for hx CAD, and given timing of symptoms
with dialysis possible that combination of being on plavix and
heparin flushes from dialysis +uremic platelets revealed a
lesion in his GI tract susceptible to bleeding.
.
GI bleed: Initially, the etiology was unclear but a differential
included ulcer, gastritis, esophageal varices (no alcohol
hx),esophageal Ca(no dysphagia), AVM, diverticulosis,
diverticulitis (llq pain), [**Month/Year (2) 499**] polyp, [**Month/Year (2) 499**] ca. The patient
had a hct of 16.2 on admission and was transfused to a goal Hct
of 30 due to CAD history. An IV PPI and desmopressin were
started in the MICU. An initial EGD showed multiple ulcers in
antrum and pylorus without clear signs of bleeding. Biopsy was
not performed since patient was on plavix. He was transferred to
the floor on [**7-18**] after his HCT remained stable X24hours. He
underwent repeat EGD and c-scope  on [**7-18**]. EGD once again showed
antral ulcers and duodenitis (biopsy pending at time of
discharge) and Cscope showed 3 sessile polyps that were resected
(biopsy pending at time of discharge). He was also started on
sucralafate QID X6weeks. He will need [**Hospital1 **] PPI for 6weeks at
least with GI follow-up for possible repeat scope to ensure
resolution since he will need lifelong plavix +/-ASA.  By time
of discharge, he was having brown stools. He did recieve his
last unit prbc on day of discharge to keep HCT near 30. He is
started on daily Fe supp along with bowel regimen.  Of note, at
time of discharge, it was noted that his H.pylori serology that
was previously negative had turned postiive by EIA, thus he was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and Rx for clarithro and amox X2weeks was added
(already on PPI [**Hospital1 **]) for triple therapy.
.
CAD s/p bypass: In the setting of his severe anemia/GIB, he had
an NSTEMI while
in ICU. The patient was seen by cardiology who agreed this was
not ACS and more likely demand related. He was kept on optimal
medical management with coreg and statin but his plavix was
held. He underwent an Echo with showed anteroseptal WMA (mid LAD
distribution) and it is unclear whether this is new/old
(reversible or fixed). We recommend that he have a outpt stress
test to assess reversibility, esp since his EF is depressed to
40% and he may be candidate for revascularisation. He is
scheduled for a cardiology appointment at [**Hospital1 18**] where he will
get a stress echo. Per cardiology and GI, we will resume plavix
10days after discharge. He stated that he only took his coreg
25mg daily due to low BP, but we reccommended he change
this to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. His cozaar was resumed and statin/tricor
kept at maximal doses.
.
H. pylori infection: The patient was found to have a positive H.
pylori serology in the setting of gastric ulcers. The patient
was placed on a PPI for his GI bleed and started on two weeks of
amoxicillin 1g [**Hospital1 **] and clarithromycin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **].

Left hand thrombophlebitis: He had a transient fever on [**7-16**] and
was started on Vanco. He had an infectious w/u which had
negative cultures and subsequently Vancomycin was stopped. The
superficial thrombophlebitis on his left doral hand resolved
prior to discharge and the patient was afebrile >24 hours.
.
Left arm thrombosis: two days prior to discharge, he complained
of left arm swel
