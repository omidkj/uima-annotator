Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5569**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis, non-functioning PD catheter

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PD catheter repositioning, partial omentectomy

History of Present Illness:
24 yo M with history of SLE, ESRD on PD, pulmonary embolism (on
warfarin) presents with fever and worsening dyspnea for 2 days.
Had approximately 3 tbsps hemoptysis on night prior to
presentation. Last PD was on thursday because catheter "not
draining appropriately." Patient denies abdominal pain except
while sleeping at night.
.
Upon arrival to the ED vitals were: T 102.4, HR 84, BP 171/110,
RR 30, O2Sat 84% on RA. Triggered and sats came up with NRB.
Intial labs showing hyperkalemia to 8.2 with EKG showing peaked
T waves and widened QRS. Received emergent potassium lowering
with insulin, bicarb, kayexylate. Additionally received calcium
gluconate. K came down to 6.2 with these measures and EKG
improved. this was followed by dialysis. Potassium normalized at
end of HD. Given fever to 102.4 in ED, started on empiric
Vancomycin/Zosyn. Blood cultures obtained. Sputum culture sent,
but was a poor spec. Attempted to sent PD cath sample, though PD
cath malpositioned according to KUB. Able to flush through PD
cath, though cannot withdraw fluid. Vitals prior to transfer to
the MICU were: T 101.1, HR 98, BP 162/100, RR 30, O2Sat 98% 5L.

.
Upon arrival to MICU, patient reports that he is feeling
fatigued. Notes that he cannot breath well while laying down.
Feels better sitting up. Has been having small-volume frothy
hemoptysis.

Echocardiogram:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic
function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion,
primarily anterior to the right ventricle and best seen on
apical views. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.


IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Small-moderate loculated anterior pericardial effusion without
evidence of hemodynamic compromise.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2166-3-22**]:
FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of a left-sided
hemodialysis catheter with its tip at the cavoatrial junction.
The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours demonstrate a
prominent bulge along the right aspect of the cardiac
silhouette. The lungs demonstrate opacities along the right mid
and lower lung with air bronchograms; to a lesser extent an
opacity is seen projecting over the left mid lung. These
opacities may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or
hemorrhage. Suggestion of bullous changes in the left lung base
persist. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral lung opacities, worse on the right, which
may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.
Infection is also not excluded.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2166-3-22**]:
FINDINGS: Multiple gas filled loops of small and large bowel are
seen, although none are abnormally dilated. Peritoneal dialysis
catheter projects from the right lower quadrant over the central
abdomen. No kink is seen along its course. No break is seen
along its course. Assessment for free air is limited by supine
positioning.
IMPRESSION: Intact peritoneal dialysis catheter.


Brief Hospital Course:
24 yo M with history of SLE, ESRD on PD, pulmonary embolism (on
warfarin) presents with fever and worsening dyspnea for 2 days
in setting of PD catheter failure. He was initially admitted to
medical service in MICU. After his hypoxemia resolved, patient
was transferred to the floor. On [**2166-3-26**], patient underwent
laparoscopic reposition of the PD catheter with partial
omentectomy. Patient was transferred to transplant service for
post-operative management.
.
#. Hypoxemia:  Patient had urgent hemodialysis on admission and
4.5 kg of fluid was removed.  He subsequent was treated with IV
furosemide and IV diuril with excellent urine output.  After
diuresis he no longer required supplemental oxygen.
Patient's CXR on admission showed bilateral opacities. Since the
patient also had fever, a presumed diagnosis of community
acquired pneumonia was made and he was treated with Azithromycin
for a 5 day-course.

#. ESRD/Hyperkalemia:
Patient presenting with potassium of 8.2 and EKG changes. After
emergent HD, EKG changes resolved. Patient's PD cath failure is
primary cause for patient presentation with hyperkalemia.
Transplant surgery was consulted and patient was taken to the
operating room on [**2166-3-26**] for reposition of the PD catheter with
partial omentectomy. Patient tolerated the procedure well. He
continued to undergo HD via his tunneled catheter. The PD
catheter was flushed with 200ml of dialysate one day prior to
discharge. Patient to resume low volume exchange one week from
the operation and gradually increase to goal.

#. Fever:
Patient with fever to 102.5 upon presentation to MICU. He
reports dyspnea as well as dysuria, making pulmonary and urinary
source most likely. Bacterial peritonitis is also possible,
though less likely given lack of abdominal pain. Patient was
treated empirically by the medical team with Vancomycin and
Zosyn for presumed peritonitis and possible hospital acquired
pneumonia for 1 week and was completed on [**2166-3-29**].

#. Hypertension:
Patient on many home medications. Was hypertensive upon
presentation to ED and BP remained high through ED course and
upon presentation to the MICU. Insetting of nitro drip,
administer drugs in step-wise approach, starting with
lisinopril, losartan, hydralazine, then add labetalol,
clonidine, amlodipine, aliskiren were carried out by
