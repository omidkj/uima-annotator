Admission Date:  [**2108-11-5**]       Discharge Date: [**2108-11-27**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old,
Portugeuse speaking male, who presented to the Emergency
Department as a transfer from an outside hospital,
complaining of left sided chest pain, non radiating,
associated with dyspnea.  The patient reports similar
symptoms approximately one week prior to this presentation.
At that time, the patient ruled in for a myocardial
infarction with positive enzymes, peak CK of 501.  He
underwent coronary catheterization and stent placement to the
left anterior descending and right posterior descending
artery coronary arteries.  His post hospital course was
complicated by congestive heart failure exacerbation.

With this current episode, the chest pain and shortness of
breath resolved after administration of oxygen, 325 mg of
aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin times two.  Most
improvement was noted with oxygen therapy via non rebreather
mask.  The patient was then able to be weaned to nasal
cannula oxygen.  Chest x-ray and clinical examination at an
outside hospital were consistent with congestive heart
failure.  There, the patient received Lasix 40 mg intravenous
and Morphine sulfate. He was started on heparin and
nitroglycerin drip at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital and transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] for further
evaluation.

On further questioning, the patient reports waking up at
approximately 3:30 a.m. on the day of admission, complaining
of shortness of breath.  He has had shortness of breath with
some dyspnea at rest since his discharge from the hospital
last week.  However, overall, he has been less dyspneic than
prior to his last admission.  He also reports vague left
sided chest pressure, unable to rate, no radiation to neck,
jaw or shoulders. No associated nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis.  He has stable two pillow orthopnea at baseline.
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ascites, lower extremity
swelling or edema.  He does report non compliance with a
sodium restriction diet since discharge.

week prior to this most current admission to left anterior
descending and right posterior descending artery.  Congestive
heart failure.  Hypertension.  Gastroesophageal reflux

retired box-maker.  Reports one pack per day tobacco history
times six years, having quit in [**2102**].  Denies any alcohol or
intravenous drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission, vital signs showed
temperature of 98.4; heart rate 93 and regular; blood
pressure 137/97; respiratory rate of 64; oxygen 96% on two
liters nasal cannula oxygen.  General appearance:  Well
developed, obese, white male, comfortable, slightly labored
breathing, no acute distress.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND
THROAT: Normal cephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular
movements intact.  Sclera anicteric.  Conjunctiva non
injected.  Oral mucosa moist.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck:
Supple.  No masses or lymphadenopathy.  Positive right
carotid bruit. Unable to assess jugulovenous pressure.
Chest:  Bilateral crackles, one third the way up both lung
fields, coarse in nature.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm.  S1 and S2 heart sounds, auscultated.  Positive two
to three out of six crescendo/decrescendo holosystolic murmur
heard best at the apex with radiation to the axilla. Abdomen:
Soft, obese, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
No hepatosplenomegaly.  Genitourinary:  Foley catheter in
place, draining bright pink to red tinged urine.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  1+ dorsalis
pedis/posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC showed white blood cell count of 9.7;
hemoglobin of 11.2; hematocrit of 36.3; platelets 287.
Coagulation profile showed PT of 13.2, PTT of 29, INR of 1.2.
Serum chemistry showed sodium of 141; potassium of 4.1;
chloride of 105; bicarbonate 26; BUN 30; creatinine 1.6
(baseline of 1.3 to 1.4.) Cardiac enzymes showed CK of 119,
CK MB of 2.1; MB index of 1.8; troponin I at outside hospital
17.10.

Electrocardiogram from outside hospital showed sinus
tachycardia at 104 beats per minute; left axis deviation;
left atrial enlargement; Q waves noted in V1 and V2, with
widened QRS; T wave inversions noted in leads 1 and AVL.

Electrocardiogram at [**Hospital1 69**],
while the patient was pain free, was consistent with the
electrocardiogram at [**Hospital3 417**].  Also demonstrated
flattening of the T waves in V5 through V6.

Coronary catheterization on [**2108-10-26**] showed an 80% right
posterior descending artery and hazy 70% proximal left
anterior descending lesion.  The right posterior descending
artery was injected with a balloon and had a stent placed. No
residual of TIMI-III flow. The left anterior descending was
predilated with a balloon; stented with a Cyper stent with an
overlap of the distal portion of the previous stent; no
residual TIMI-III flow.  Resting hemodynamics showed elevated
right and left filling pressures.  Pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 28; left ventricular end diastolic pressure of
33.

Echocardiogram from [**2108-10-29**] showed ejection fraction of less
than 20%; [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated; Left ventricle severely dilated
with severe left ventricular function; resting regional wall
motion abnormalities, including mid to distal inferior,
inferolateral, septal, anterior akinesis with apical
akinesis/dyskinesis.  One to two plus mitral regurgitation
was noted.  Borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

Chest x-ray from [**2108-11-3**] showed pulmonary edema, consistent
with congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Problem #1:  Coronary artery disease:  The
patient had a known history of coronary artery disease,
status post a myocardial infarction one week prior to his
admission.  It was felt that his elevated troponin value on
this most recent admission, on [**2108-11-5**], was likely residual
from his myocardial infarction the prior week.  However, in
order to completely rule out for myocardial infarction, his
cardiac enzymes were cycled.  He had a flat cardiac enzyme
times three sets.  Initially, he was continued on aspirin,
Plavix, Lipitor, oxygen, Metoprolol.  Ace inhibitor was held
in light of his worsening renal function and hematuria.

Initially, the plan was to titrate up the patient's
Metoprolol XL to a higher dose for greater beta blockade.
However, he was unable to titrate up the dose, secondary to
hypotension.

On the evening of [**2108-11-13**], the patient had an episode of
decreased oxygen saturation and hypotension.  As a result of
this, he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit.
Electrocardiogram at the time of his sustained hypotension
was suggestive of a demand ischemia with anterolateral ST
depressions.  He transiently required pressor therapy for
blood pressure support.

Throughout his medical Intensive Care Unit stay, his beta
blocker and ace inhibitor were held.  Cardiac enzyme
