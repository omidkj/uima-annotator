Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cathetherization
PROCEDURE:
1. Coronary artery bypass graft x4; left internal mammary
    artery to the left anterior descending artery and
    saphenous vein grafts to the diagonal, posterior
    descending coronary artery and obtuse marginal artery.
2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.


History of Present Illness:
61 year old spanish speaking female with complaints of [**3-5**] days
of dyspnea associated with a cough. Over the proceding month,
she had decribed worsening chest pain associated with activity.
Her cough was productive of brown to white sputum.
.
Patient arrived at [**Last Name (un) 4199**] ED on [**2104-1-30**] for dyspnea and denied
chest discomfort. EKG revealed 2mm ST depressions in leads v3-v6
and tropI came back at 23. Her vitals were 90-110 Sinus Rhythm/
sinus tachy, BP 120-130-s/50's-60's, temp 98.1, sa02 100% on 2L
nc. She received 3 neb treatments in ED with improvement of
dyspnea. She also had difficulty lying flat. She was taken
directly to the cath lab and was found to have [**3-5**] vessel
disease not opitimal for stenting. She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**]
service for cardiac surgery evaluation.
.
On the floor, she continues to deny chest pain.
.
On review of systems, she denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors, nausea, vomiting. All of the other review of systems
were negative.

The patient is a 61yo Hispanic female with a history of reactive
airway disease and acute diastolic CHF who recently developed
increasing DOE as well as chest pressure with activity.  She had
an episode of SOB and chest pain early this morning, for which
she was admitted to an OSH.  She ruled in for NSTEMI and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Cath revealed 2VD and surgical consult is
now requested.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent disease. The LAD had a long 50% mid vessel stenosis.
The Cx had
a heavily calcified 90% stenosis at the origin of the vessel as
well as
a 50% distal stenosis. The RCA had a 60% proximal stenosis and a
60% mid
vessel stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left

filling pressures with an RVEDP of 19 mmHg and a PCWP of 20
mmHg. There
was moderate pulmonary hypertension with a PASP of 48 mmHg. The
Central
aortic pressure was noted to be 100/45 mmHg. The cardiac index
was
slightly elevated at 4.6 L/min/m2.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Moderate primary pulmonary hypertension.

[**1-30**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with infero-lateral
hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2103-8-17**],
regional LV systolic dysfunction is new.


Brief Hospital Course:
61 year old spanish speaking female with history of DM, HTN, HL
who presents with NSTEMI and cath showing 2 vessel disease and
moderate diastolic dysfunction.

# CORONARIES: Patient had NSTEMI noted at outside hospital with
ST depressions in V3-6 and troponin I at 23 and was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cathetherization.  Cath showed 2 vessel
disease with moderate diastolic dysfunction.  Echocardiogram
showed new regional LV systolic dysfunction with EF reduced to
45-50% from 70% in [**8-8**].  She was medically managed with
aspirin, full dose statin, beta blocker, and heparin drip until
she completed her post-cath plavix washout and was sent for
CABG...

# PUMP: She has a history of hypertension with new regional LV
systolic dysfunction seen on echocardiogram with EF 45-50%. She
was continued on her home Diovan and HCTZ.  Given her diastolic
dysfunction seen on cath, she was diuresed with lasix.

# RHYTHM: sinus

# Tracheobronchial malasia/Asthma: Her home albuterol,
singulair, ipratropium, advair, fluticas
