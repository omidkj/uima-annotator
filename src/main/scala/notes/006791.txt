History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 74243**] is an 89 yo woman with severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] <0.8 cm2),
global systolic dysfunction (LVEF 30-35%), diastolic
dysfunction, hypercholesterolemia who presented to the ED with
epigastric discomfort.
.
She reports that since the day prior to admission at about 3
p.m., she has had epigastric discomfort and nausea on and off.
She reports that it was worsened after both lunch and dinner.
She did not vomit, but felt as though it would make her feel
better. She denied any increase in her discomfort with exertion.
She denies associated chest pain, discomfort or pressure. She
denies shortness of breath, palpitations or diaphoresis. She
reports an associated increase in belching and a bile taste in
her mouth.
.
She has been admitted twice over the last few weeks, once for
syncope and more recently for SOB. She underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**4-29**] and CTA of her chest on [**5-1**].
.
In the ED, her initial VSs were 98, 73, 104/57, 16 99%RA. She
was mildly hypotensive to the mid-80s systolic, so she was
admitted to the CCU. She did not receive any medication or IVF.
.

discomfort has resolved. She denies lightheadedness, dizziness
or syncope. She denied leg swelling or calf pain. She denied
significant change in her bowel habits. She did report decreased
uruination over the past couple of days. She reports adherence
to her medication regimen.

.
Chest X-ray ([**5-4**]):  There are persistent small bilateral
pleural
effusions; however, the previously seen edema has decreased
significantly.
There is now mild central vascular engorgement. The heart
remains moderately enlarged. IMPRESSION: Persistent small
bilateral pleural effusions with improvement in pulmonary edema
which is now mild.
.
Unlateral lower extremity ultrasound ([**5-6**]): Examination is
somewhat limited due to portable technique and difficulty with
patient positioning. Allowing for this limitation, there is
normal flow and compressibility within the right common femoral,
superficial femoral and popliteal veins. Augmentation is
preserved. Flow is noted within the right posterior tibial vein.
IMPRESSION: Negative for right lower extremity DVT.
.
Video Swallow ([**5-12**]): 1. Mild delay in oral transit time.
Otherwise, normal oropharyngeal swallow function. No evidence
for aspiration or penetration. 2. Delayed transit of the barium
tablet at the gastroesophageal junction, likely related to the
patient's known hernia.




Brief Hospital Course:
# Epigastric discomfort: Patient was admitted with epigastric
pain with initial concerns that this represented her anginal
equivalent. She had a mild elevation in troponin, but this in
the setting of elevated creatinine. She had had recent coronary
angiography that did not demonstrate any significant coronary
artery disease. This resolved early in admission.

# Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated to 3.0 from baseline
of 1.0 on admission likely combination of two recent contrast
studies (coronary angiography and CTA), combined with continued
medication adherence and possibly a component of TMP-SMX
contributing to increased creatinine. Her lasix and valsartan
were held initially and creatinine improved with very gentle
fluid resuscitation.

# Transient hyperkalemia: Likely secondary to acute renal
insufficiency. Responded to lasix and kayexalate.

# Hypotension: Mild with systolics in 80's, resolved with
minimal IVF bolus. Initially furosemide, metoprolol, valsartan
were held. As below she did require lasix for diuresis after
developing shortness of breath.

# Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: Initially there
was no evidence of volume overload on exam and valsartan and
lasix were held in setting of acute renal failure. After
receiving packed RBCs she developed shortness of breath and had
CXR consistent with CHF so was diuresed with IV lasix. She
subsequently developed diarrhea secondary to C Diff colitis and
became volume depleted again. After resolution of diarrhea, her
lasix was restarted at home doses and she maintained euvolemia
on this dose.

# UTI: Diagnosed prior to admission, her antibiotics were
changed from bactrim to ampicillin given acute renal failure on
admission. This was continued for 5 days.

# Chronic anemia: Baseline hematocrit of 30, hematocrit
decreased to 25 on admission in the setting of IV fluids. She
received 2units pRBCs for decreased BPs and Hct. Remained stable
afterward. Workup consistent with anemia of chronic disease. No
evidence of GIB or hemolysis. She was continued on iron
supplementation

# ?Aspiration event: Patient had witnessed aspiration event on
[**2104-5-10**] while taking pills with desaturation to 90's. She
recovered spontaneously within hours and remained stable from a
respiratory standpoint. She underwent a sppech and swallow
evaluation which showed no evidence of aspiration therefore she
was not coninued on aspiration precuations. No further
aspiration events.

# C. diff colitis:  The patient was noted to have diarrhea with
stool studies positive for C.diff on [**5-10**].  She was started on
Flagyl PO with resolution of her symtpoms. Prior to cardiac
surgery, she completed a 14 day course. Repeat stool cultures
remained negative.

# Aortic Stenosis: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent
admission for syncope. CT surgery was consulted and decided to
proceed with aortic valve replacement after resolution of acute
renal failure and C Diff colitis. On [**5-20**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
performed an aortic valve rep
