Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
gentleman with diabetes, cerebral palsy, and cardiomyopathy
presenting from an outside hospital in cardiopulmonary shock.

In [**2160**], the patient had a cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital 14852**] which revealed severe 3-vessel disease
with preserved left ventricular function.  At that time, he
underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
stenting of his left circumflex artery.  Since that time, he
has been managed medically for chronic exertional dyspnea.

On the morning of admission, he awoke around 2 a.m.
complaining of chest pain and diaphoresis.  He took an
aspirin and nitroglycerin with no relief and decided to
present to [**Hospital6 3872**] at approximately 9 a.m..

There, an electrocardiogram revealed an inferoposterior
myocardial infarction.  At that time, his systolic blood
pressure was in the 90s.   He was seen by a cardiologist, and
plans were made for emergent transfer to [**Hospital1 346**] for primary angioplasty.  While
awaiting transfer, the patient's blood pressure dropped to
the 60s; requiring dopamine and Neo-Synephrine as a drip.  He
was stabilized and transported via med-flight.

On arrival, the patient was ill-appearing but able to answer
questions.  He had ongoing 7/10 chest pain, and his systolic
blood pressure was in the 80s.  Given increasing respiratory
distress, the decision was made to semi-electively intubate
the patient.  During the intubation, the patient had a
bradycardia arrest with a heart rate down to the 20s, and no
measurable systolic blood pressure.  Epinephrine and atropine
were given, and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  His
heart rate returned to the 100s, and his systolic blood
pressure returned to the 90s.

An angioplasty was subsequently performed and demonstrated
3-vessel disease with total occlusion of the proximal left
circumflex artery which was treated with a stent.  During the
procedure, he was noted to have junctional bradycardia with
complete heart block and frequent episodes of ventricular
tachycardia requiring treatment with amiodarone 150-mg
boluses.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (His medications at home included)
 1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
 2.  Atenolol 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
 3.  Lipitor 40 mg by mouth once per day.
 4.  Diltiazem 120 mg by mouth once per day.
 5.  Imdur 60 mg by mouth once per day.
 6.  Tricor 160 mg by mouth once per day.
 7.  Avapro 150 mg by mouth once per day.
 8.  Glucophage 850 mg by mouth twice per day.
 9.  Folate 1 mg by mouth every day.
10.  Glucotrol 20 mg by mouth twice per day.
11.  Actos 40 mg by mouth once per day.
12.  Zoloft 50 mg by mouth once per day.

ALLERGIES:

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  His laboratory
values were significant for an arterial blood gas which
showed a pH of 7.18, a PCO2 of 40, and a PO2 of 57.  This
arterial blood gas was taken while the patient was intubated.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The physical
examination was significant for fixed and dilated pupils.  No
breath sounds.  No heart sounds after three minutes of
auscultation.  No response to verbal or painful stimuli
including sternal rub.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The Coronary Care Unit team was called to
evaluate the patient for unresponsiveness given that the
patient's telemetry and arterial line readings indicated
asystole.  All medications and mechanical ventilation were
discontinued, as per the family's wishes in light of the
patient's profound hypoxia, hypotension, and poor prognosis;
status post cardiac arrest.

The patient was pronounced dead at 4:50 p.m.  The family was
notified.  The Medical Examiner was [**Name (NI) 653**], as the patient
expired less than 24 hours into the admission.  The Medical
Examiner declined to pursue the case further.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Deceased.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Not applicable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Cardiopulmonary arrest.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Not applicable.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:   No applicable.
