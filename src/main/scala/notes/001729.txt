IMAGING:
[**2117-9-13**] RUQ ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLERS
1. Patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate waveforms and
direction of
flow. No evidence of thrombus.
2. Findings consistent with known cirrhosis.
3. Stable splenomegaly.
4. Stable dilated intrahepatic ducts and pneumobilia,
predominantly in the
left lobe of the liver.

[**2117-9-20**] Abdominal Ultrasound
Thin pockets of ascitic fluid are seen in the lower quadrants
bilaterally adjacent to bowel loops without sufficient quantity
for safe paracentesis.

9/20/11EGD:
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus
Varices at the fundus
Food in the fundus
Ulcer in the antrum
Normal mucosa in the whole duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

[**9-15**] EGD
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus
Varices at the fundus
Food in the fundus
Ulcer in the antrum
Normal mucosa in the whole duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

[**2117-9-21**] EGD
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus.
Gastric varices were seen on retroflexed view in the gastric
cardia. There was no evidence of bleeding. There was a single
overlying ulcer visualized on the mucosal surface. This finding
was reviewed the hepatology attending and the decision was made
not to attempt additional intervention.
Mild portal hypertensive gastropathy was seen.

[**9-21**] Colonoscopy
Large rectal varices were seen in the distal rectum.
The rectum and sigmoid colon appeared otherwise normal. Solid
stool was encountered in the descending colon. There was no
evidence of blood




Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo M with hx of hep C cirrhosis s/p transplant who presents
with worsening fatigue and weakness found to have anemia from
gastric variceal bleed.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# Gastric Variceal Bleed: The patient had 4 EGDs. On the initial
EGD the source of active bleeding was injected with epinephrine
however the patient's HCT continued to drop. During the third
EGD hemostasis was achieved with dermabond injections into the
large varix in the gastric fundus. He required a total of 6
units of pRBCs. Patient was started on octreotide gtt and
protonix IV BID. He was also started on cefrtiaxone for
prophylaxis. Patient remained hemodynamically stable and was
transferred back to the floor. His PPI was switched to po.
Ceftriaxone was switched to po cipro at treatment doses to
complete 5 day course and ultimately transitioned to
prophylactic doses. Later in his hospitalization he developed
