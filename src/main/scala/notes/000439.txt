Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-3-14**] Ascending Aorta and Hemiarch Replacement with 28
millimeter Gelweave Graft

History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 year old female with a PMH significant for
hypertension. Over the several years, she has complained of
progressive dyspnea on exertion. She also admits to chest
pressure which is nonradiating. Her symptoms do not occur at
rest. A chest CT scan in [**2142-1-21**] revealed an ascending
aortic aneurysm, measuring 5.4 centimeters. Subsequent cardiac
catheterization confirmed dilated ascending aorta with normal
coronary arteries and preserved cardiac output. Based on the
above results, she was referred for cardiac surgical
intervention.

Past Medical History:
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease/Asthma
Hypertension
Osteoarthritis
Colon Polyps
Seasonal Allergies
s/p T&A
AAA

Social History:
Denies tobacco. Drinks alcohol socially. Denies recreational
drugs. Patient is single and lives alone on [**Location (un) **].

Family History:
Non-contributory. No family history of premature CAD.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: BP 157/75, HR 65, RR 20, SAT  100% on room air
General: well developed female in no acute distress
HEENT: oropharynx benign, EOMI
Neck: supple, no JVD,
Heart: regular rate, normal s1s2, no murmur or rub
Lungs: clear bilaterally
Abdomen: soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds
Ext: warm, no edema, no varicosities
Pulses: 2+ distally
Neuro: nonfocal

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**3-14**]: Pre bypass: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal(LVEF>55%). The ascending
aorta is markedly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+]tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Post bypass: Perserved
biventricular function lvef >55% no wall motion abnormalities.
Trace AI. Proximal portion of ascending aortic graft visualized
in good position. Remaining exam unchanged from baseline.
CXR [**3-20**]: 1. Cardiomegaly, which is new in the interval. Upper
zone vascular redistribution without evidence of frank pulmonary
edema. These findings may be secondary to early congestive heart
failure and volume overload, however, a pericardial effusion is
also a possibility. 2. Interval worsening of bibasilar
atelectasis. Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
On the day of admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 27853**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] surgical
replacement of her ascending aorta and hemi-arch by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. The operation was uneventful and there were no
complications. For further details, please see separate dictated
operative note. Following the procedure, she was brought to the
CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. She was weaned from
inotropic support without difficulty. She maintained stable
hemodynamics and was then transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day one. Low dose beta blockade was resumed and
advanced as tolerated. Diuretics were also started and she was
gently diuresed towards her pre-operative weight. She was
transfused with packed red blood cells for a postoperative
anemia. Her lowest hematocrit was around 23%. Her chest tubes
and epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op day two.
Over several days, she continued to make clinical improvements
with diuresis and increased ambulation. Physical therapy
followed patient during post-op course for strength and
mobility. Intermittent episodes of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation were noted on telemetry on post-op day five. Beta
blockade was further advanced while K and Mg levels were
optimized. She was eventually started on Amiodarone and
maintained sinus rhythm for >24 hrs prior to being discharge. On
post-op day six she was discharged home with VNA services and
the appropriate follow-up appointments.
