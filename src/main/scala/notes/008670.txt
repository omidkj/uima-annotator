Chest Xray [**2120-5-16**] - UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The cardiac,
mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Pulmonary vascularity
is not engorged. Except for minimal linear  atelectasis in the
left lung base, the lungs appear clear without focal
consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
Known old right posterior rib fractures are better evaluated on
the CT from [**2120-2-19**]. IMPRESSION: Subsegmental
atelectasis in the left lung base. No acute cardiopulmonary
abnormality otherwise demonstrated.
.
RIB FILMS
FINDINGS: Slightly low lung volumes. Focal heterogeneous opacity
within the right lower lobe, likely representing atelectasis,
cannot exclude infection. Linear opacity in the left lung base,
likely subsegmental atelectasis. No definite pleural fluid. The
heart and mediastinum are normal. No definite rib lesions. No
displaced rib fractures identified. Mild AC joint degenerative
changes with osseous proliferation.
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite displaced rib fracture.
2. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, cannot exclude infection on
the right.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 58 yo male with HIV (CD4 463, VL undetectable on
[**2120-3-1**]), HCV, c/b stage II cirrhosis, COPD GOLD stage II,
chronic pain and spinal stenosis on [**Date Range **]/narcotics who
presented with dyspnea and was treated for a COPD exacerbation
and community acquired pneumonia.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
ICU Course - admitted to ICU for observation as concern for
increased work of breathing.  Due to history of HIV, ED gave
pentamidine for concern of PCP; however CD4 count 899 when
checked on overnight labs.  Flu swab sent, placed on tamiflu
pending negative test.  Continued treatment for CAP with
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin, started in ED.  Due to wheezes on
exam, started standing nebulizer treatments and IV steroids.
Overnight, patient's oxygen was weaned to room air, tolerated it
well.  He complained of right sided pleuritic rib pain, unclear
etiology as no evidence of PNA.  Rib films showed no definite
displaced rib fracture. Patient was continued on outpatient pain
regimen and HAART for HIV. He was transferred to the floor the
following morning, saturating 97% on room air with significant
improvement in his lung exam.
.
MEDICAL Course: On the general medical floors he was continued
on prednisone burst of 60mg daily for a total of five days which
were continued on discharge.  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were
discontinued in favor of levofloxacin for a total of a five day
course for treatment of community acquired pneumonia.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES
# HIV: Last CD4 463, VL undetectable [**2120-3-1**]. CD4 count rechecked
in the ICU and was 899. He was continued on efavirenz,

.
# SPINAL STENOSIS/CHRONIC BACK PAIN: Patient on narcotics
contract. He was continued on outpatient oxycodone, oxycontin
and oxycodone, as well as gabapentin. He complained of rib pain
sustained during a recent fall, with tenderness on palpation of

pain seeking behavior.

# DEPRESSION: He was continued on  citalopram.
.
# NAUSEA: Chronic due to HIV medications. He was continued on
