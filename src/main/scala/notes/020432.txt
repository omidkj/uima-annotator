History of Present Illness:
81 Russian speaking F with h/o anemia, Crohn's, PE; admit from
ED with dyspnea following blood transfusion.  Patient with
history of myelodysplasia/multifactorial anemia requiring
transfusions at least once monthly.  Presented to hematology
clinic today for planned transfusion (recent hct 22.3) of 1 unit
PRBCs, given over 2.5 hours.  Per heme notes, patient completed
transfusion, walked to BR and reported dyspnea and palpitations.
 Per daughter she developed symptoms during transfusion, which
was "sped up".  In clinic O2 sat 85% RA increasing to 97% on 3L
by FM.  BP 190/50, HR 100.  Later had episode of diarrhea and
vomiting at clinic.  Given 10 IV lasix x 2 at clinic.  Prior to
clinic visit had been feeling very well, in USOH.  Has VNA and
O2 sats on RA at home range 92-96%.
.
In ED vitals were T99.2, P90, BP 170/72.  O2 sat 80% on RA, then
83% on 4L, then 96% on NRB.  Briefly on CPAP (sats 99%), then
back to NRB, and down to 4L NC with sats 96-98%.  Labs included
Hct 27.3, creat 1.8, BNP 1590, trop 0.05.  Received benadryl,
zofran, nitro paste.  CXR with cardiomegaly without pulm edema.
Satting 97% on 4L but tachypneic, prompting ICU admit.
.
Currently feeling much better in ICU, denies nausea, shortness
of breath, chest pain.

General: Appears comfortable, NAD, resp rate currently 24
HEENT: PERRL, NC/AT, conjunctiva with slight pallor.
Neck: difficult to appreciate JVD
Lungs: bibasilar rales, currently R>L while lying on R side
Cardiac: RRR, S1 S2, [**3-6**] SM best at LSB
Abdomen: soft, denies TTP, reducible ventral hernia, +BS

Pertinent Results:
CXR:
1. The acute onset of alveolar infiltrates, likely edema and the
left lower lobe consolidation with the patient's history of
transfusion suggest a transfusion related acute lung injury.

ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 F with anemia/myelodysplasia receiving regular transfusions
with known RBC antigen antibodies admitted with dyspnea and
hypoxemia following transfusion.

SOB: It was felt that the patient had a TRALI reaction.  The
blook bank was going to perform further testing on the donor
blood as confirmation.  The patient does have chronic anemia
secondary to a chronic myeloplastic disorder.  She is
transfusion dependent and receives packed red blood cell
transfusions about once per month.  She did have an additional
transfusions (3 units) after admission to the intensive case
unit without further incident.

Also, there was concern about a PE.  A V/Q scan was performed
and showed a moderate to high probablity for a PE.  She was
started on presumptive treatment with lovenox daily.  She will
followup with her PCP to determine the length of treatment.

Fever/Altered mental status:  During her hospital course she was
treated with a 3 day course of bactrim.  Her mental status
improved to baseline with treatment of the UTI.

Crohns: The patients crohns was stable.  She was seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3708**]
(her Gastroenterolgoist) who said she is overdue for
colonoscopy/EGD but this was to be scheduled as an outpatient.

Of note, the patient remained FULL CODE during her hospital
course.
