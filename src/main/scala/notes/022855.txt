Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent aortic valve replacement
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. For surgical details, please see seperate
dictated operative note. Following the operation, she was

the SDU on postoperative day one. She went on to experience

Amiodarone and beta blockade. She converted back to a normal
sinus rhythm on POD 2 and remained in normal sinus rhythm
