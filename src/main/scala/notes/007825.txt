Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
with end-stage renal disease (status post cadaveric renal
transplant in [**2140-1-30**]) who comes back with delayed
graft function and multiple episodes of rejection on a
regimen of Solu-Medrol.  She was started on Zyvox on [**6-23**]
for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.  The patient is here
for an increasing creatinine and possible renal biopsy.  No
complaint of fever or chills.  Some nausea and vomiting on
Zyvox.  Her last Coumadin dose was in [**2141-6-26**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Prograf 1.5 mg twice per day.
2. Prednisone 5 mg once per day.
3. Bactrim single strength one tablet once per day.
4. Albuterol nebulizers.
5. Protonix 40 mg once per day.
6. Colace 100 mg twice per day.
7. Levoxyl 175 mcg once per day.
8. Lopressor 100 mg twice per day.
9. Lasix 40 mg once per day.
10.      Coumadin 2 mg once per day.
11.      Lisinopril 7.5 mg once per day.
12.      Zyvox 600 mg twice per day.
13.      Os-Cal.
14.      Percocet as needed (for pain).


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs revealed
temperature was 97.2, her heart rate was 60, her blood
pressure was 120/60, respiratory rate was 20, and 98 percent
on room air.  The patient was alert and oriented times three.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  There were no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  Normal first and second heart sounds.  The
abdomen was nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
The abdomen was soft and nontender throughout.  No tenderness
over graft site.  The area of the transplant showed a nicely
healing scar.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  At this time, it was determined the patient
would be admitted and a renal biopsy would be considered to
rule our rejection.

The patient was called to the floor.  The patient was having
chest pain and decreased oxygen saturations at 3:15 a.m.  The
patient was placed a nonrebreather mask, and her saturations
increased.  Her blood pressure at this time was 185/85, and
her examination revealed slight bilateral lower crackles.  An
electrocardiogram showed her to be in a normal sinus rhythm
at 65 beats per minute and showed lateral peaked T waves with
no ST changes or T wave changes.  Her fluid was then
decreased to a rate of 40 cc per hour.  She was given Lasix
40 mg for one dose, and enzymes were sent, and the patient
was placed on telemetry.  Her chest x-ray at this time
revealed likely excess fluid in the lower lung fields.

At this time, the patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  On the morning of [**6-30**] - on hospital
day two - the patient was intubated, requiring ventilation.
The patient was then placed on Lasix twice per day at a dose
of 80 mg, and dialysis was considered for this patient.
Infectious Disease was also consulted at this point, as the
patient had been started on linezolid for vancomycin-
resistant enterococcus in her urine as an outpatient.  The
patient had episodes of nausea during this time with
occasional shakes and dysuria, but no fevers.  A culture was
then sent off to evaluate her urine and was followed.  At
this time, Infectious Disease agreed to continue treatment
with the linezolid while watching her FK506 levels closely.
The patient continued to be followed by the staff of the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit at this time.

On [**2141-7-1**] the patient began to have abdominal and
diarrhea, and Clostridium difficile cultures were sent.  On
[**7-1**], the patient also received a bronchoscopy that
revealed mild collapse of the posterior wall of the right
main bronchus with respiratory effort.  The patient was also
followed by the Rental Transplant team during this stay who
anticipated the patient would require hemodialysis given her
decreased glomerulo filtration rate and would to decide when
to initiate hemodialysis.  The patient continued to stay in
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at this time and was
continued on antibiotics.

On hospital day five - [**2141-7-3**] - the patient was
extubated.  The patient was placed on a pulmonary toilet at
this time, and the plan was to advance her diet as tolerated.
The patient continued to be followed by Infectious Disease at
this time who again suggested continuing linezolid while
awaiting results of the urine culture.  The patient was also
evaluated by Physical Therapy at this time (on [**2141-7-3**])
who suggested the likely need for rehabilitation.

On hospital day six - [**2141-7-4**] - the patient continued in
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, and per Infectious Disease
suggestion, the patient was changed from Levaquin to
meropenem as her urine culture grew out Klebsiella.  The
sputum culture also grew out Klebsiella at this time that was
meropenem sensitive.  Also on [**7-4**], sedation was
discontinued.  Hydralazine was discontinued.  The patient was
out of bed receiving chest physical therapy and was
continually followed the Renal Transplant team.

The patient was transferred to the floor at this time; [**Hospital Ward Name 121**]
Ten.  The patient again began to experience chest pain that
radiated at this time to her left upper extremity.  The pain
increased on inspiration and was shown nonexertional and
nonreproducible.  The patient received 60 intravenously of
Lasix at this time and was again placed on a nonrebreather
mask for a low pO2.  All of her enzymes, at this point, so
far, had come back negative; both troponin, creatine kinase,
and MB fractions.  She was due to again receive a full workup
of cardiac enzymes for this episode of chest pain, and a
biopsy was still considered.  The patient was continued on
Lopressor.  Aspirin was given.

Cardiology was consulted, and there was a hold placed on the
renal biopsy at this time.  Cardiology suggested the etiology
of the chest pain and desaturation was likely secondary to
overload in the context of left ventricular diastolic and
systolic dysfunction with mild aortic insufficiency and
mitral regurgitation.  The first set of troponin levels came
back at 0.13 and then went up 0.30, and Cardiology began to
suggest the likely need for catheterization of this patient.
At this time, the patient's platelet count was beginning to
decrease; dropping from a baseline of 80 to 50,000 at this
point.  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibodies were sent
off, which later came back negative.  The patient was not
amenable to cardiac catheterization, per Cardiology
suggestion, and the patient to have dialysis.  Hematology was
also consulted at this time due to the drop in her platelet
count.

On hospital day nine, the patient continued to have episodic
chest pain which was relieved by low-dose morphine with no
associated symptoms at this time.  Her echocardiogram showed
an ejection fraction of 50 percent, with 2 plus tricuspid
regurgitation, and mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and
revealed a new apical wall motion defect since [**2141-5-26**].
It was suggested that the patient receive a 2-unit
transfusion of packed red blood cells to keep her hematocrit
above goal of 28, and the plan was to transfuse this blood
and follow with hemodialysis.

On hospital day ten - [**7-8**] - the patient continued to
progress and the formal plan was discussed with the patient
and her family.  At this time, the patient continually her
desire to not pursue aggressive care for her likely heart
condition.  The plan at this time was to decrease the
immunosuppression and proceed with anticoagulation.  At this
time, the patient was repeatedly refusing rehabilitation.  At
this point, Infectious Disease signed off and stated that the
patient would have an appointment on [**2141-8-17**] in their
Clinic.  The patient was also followed by Physical Therapy at
this time who suggested endurance training and ambulation
three times per day.

The patient continued to progress well and was without chest
pain on [**2141-7-9**].  On [**7-10**], the patient continued to
progress and was doing significantly better with ambulation
with Physical Therapy and was p
