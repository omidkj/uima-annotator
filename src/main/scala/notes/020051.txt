Primary hyperparathyroidism


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Parathyroidectomy with removal of right inferior parathyroid

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40317**] is a 60 year old male with a past medical history
significant for CAD, CHF, CVA, HTN, recent diagnosis of prostate
cancer, and primary hyperparathyroidism (ultrasound positive
right lower pole, sestamibi negative) who was admitted for
scheduled right parathyroidectomy which was performed on
[**2149-11-10**]. His post op course was complicated by a wound
infection with purulence draining from his neck wound which was
explored at the bedside and showed frank pus with initial gram
stain demonstrating GPC in clusters and was started on
vancomycin.

On POD 2 (day of transfer to MICU) he was also found to have
progressively worsening hypoxia and fever with desaturations to
88-90% RA improved to 92-93% on 4L NC, and eventually progressed
to needing a 40% shovel mask. He also developed fever to 101.1.
Imaging showed evidence of RLL consolidation and he then had a
CTA that did NOT show any PE but demonstrated right lung base
consolidation. He also received 20 mg IV Lasix for pulmonary
edema. He was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management.

Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension.
2. CVA in [**2143**] status post TPA administration.
3. s/p MI in [**2143**] (no known intervention) with associated CHF,
unclear [**Name2 (NI) **], never been on diuretuics
4. Chronic pancreatitis thought to be due to EtOH
5. Bilateral hip replacement.
6. Left knee arthroscopy times multiple.
7. Recently diagnosed with prostate cancer a few months ago;
currently planned for external beam radiation therapy.
8. H/o RA since childhood
9. S/p right lower parathyroidectomy complicated by wound
infection and right lower lung base consolidation

Past Psych Hx:
a)Prior dx- depression in past year, none prior to this
b)Hospitalizations- denies
c)Suicide- denies
d)Aggression-denies
e)Treaters- [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name 23509**]; No prior psychiatric treaters

Social History:
Lives at [**Hospital3 11148**] [**Hospital3 **] Facility in  [**Location (un) 86**],
[**State 350**]. He has had multiple personal traumas in the last
five years, including the death of several family members and
the loss of his job along with multiple hospital admissions for
chronic pancreatitis that he denies is related to ETOH. He
smokes five to six cigarettes per day and has done that for the
past 30 years. He drinks ETOH socially. He has no drug abuse
reported.

Family History:
1. Brother with melanoma.
2. Father died at age 85, did not die of prostate cancer but had
prostate cancer, received brachytherapy.
3. Uncle with cancer of unknown primary.
4. Both paternal grandparents with cancer of unknown primary
site.

Physical Exam:
On [**2149-11-18**]:
VS: 99.2; 74; 132/72; 12; 95% (RA).
Gen: NAD
HEENT: Neck dressing c/di/i
CV: Nl S1+S2
Pulm: CTA bilat
Abd: S/NT/ND +bs
Ext: Trace edema bilaterally.  Left arm in cast.
Neuro: Oriented to person, place, and year. CN II-XII intact.
R UE PICC line; RUE cord (antecubital)

Pertinent Results:
[**2149-11-13**] CTA chest:  Likely aspiration pneumonia. Moderate in
severity, further supported by the presence of debris in the
trachea.
.
[**11-15**] wrist:  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**10-21**],
overlying cast somewhat obscures detail. The fracture lines in
the distal ulna is again seen, as is the extensive dystrophic
calcification between the lower shaft of the ulna and radius.
There is approximately 7 mm distraction of the distal fracture
fragment.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40317**] is a 60 year old male with a past medical history
significant for CAD, CHF, CVA, HTN, recent diagnosis of prostate
cancer admitted for scheduled right parathyroidectomy

evidence of RLL consolidation.

was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with concern for sepsis. With A-a gradient
and focal consolidation at right base with scattered ground

8. Prostate CA: Plan for external beam radiation; will need
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 656**].
