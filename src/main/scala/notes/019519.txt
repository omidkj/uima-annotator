Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, tongue numbness, R arm numbness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2167-4-14**] - CABGx3 (Left internal mammary-> Left anterior
descending artery, Vein graft->Obtuse marginal artery, Vein
graft->Right coronary artery)


History of Present Illness:
48 year old diabetic patient with a history of ESRD s/p failing
transplant, recently started on PD, awaiting repeat renal
transplant, with diffuse CAD scheduled for CABG [**2167-4-14**] who
presents with 4/10 intermittent chest discomfort. He was feeling
well until this morning when he went to the store and felt
fatigued and nauseated with an acid feeling in his chest. He
came home and rested and continued to feel an intermittent acid
feeling of chest discomfort [**4-2**] that would come and go without
any identifiable precipitant. It was associated also with
diaphoresis and SOB at rest. He has had chest discomfort like
this in the past which he says has been worked up as atypical CP
before. The last time he had it was about 2 weeks prior. He took
a nap and when he woke up he felt the bottom of his tongue was
numb and his right lateral wrist and his R tricep were numb. He
has had this constillation of numbness before and has been
attributed to his peripheral neuropathy, but the degree of
numbness was worse than usual. It would come and go independent
of his CP and would last 4-5 minutes. Given his overall feeling
of being unwell he had his sister bring him into the [**Name (NI) **] for
evaluation.  No HA, visual changes. Of note, the patient says he
had a recent retinal artery thrombus diagnosed 2 weeks ago,
followed by [**Last Name (un) **], associated with R peripheral vision loss. FS
this am was 569, high for him, he gave himself 8 units in am,
additional 6units with his breakfast-->275.
.
ED Course: Initial vitals- T98.3 HR89 BP181/100-->232/108 RR18
O2Sat98% 4/10CP FS 258; EKG showed NSR@82 with no significant
changes from prior. CE's were elevated with CK: 624  MB: 16
MBI: 2.6  Trop: 0.18. CXR was wnl. Nitro gtt was started for SBP
230/130-->176/93. Maalox was given and CP and symptoms resolved.
ASA 325mg was given after getting the OK from CT [**Doctor First Name **]. CT head
was which was negative for major infarct or bleed and he was
started on a heparin gtt. He was given lopressor 5mg
IVx3->151/86. He was also given maalox cocktail. Cards was
consulted and felt this was a troponin leak in the setting of
hypertension. Renal was contact[**Name (NI) **] and made aware of admission.
He was admitted for management of hypertensive urgency before
CABG scheduled [**4-14**]. He was guaiac neg.
.
He says his CP resolved with lowered blood pressure and his
nausea/numbness resolved with maalox in the ED.
.
ROS: as above, also negative for fever, vomiting, diarrhea,
cough. + runny nose + seasonal allergies. + baseline
constipation. no BRBPR. no myalgias.

-ESRD [**1-24**] DM: s/p renal transplant [**2148**], recently deteriorating
renal function from chronic allograft nephropathy, started
peritoneal dialysis on [**2167-1-14**], being evaluated for
repeat renal transplant

Cardiac Risk Factors: + Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension

Cardiac History: Future CABG, likely 3vessel with LIMA to LAD
scheduled for [**2167-4-14**]
.
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2167-4-1**] anatomy as
follows:
1- Severe diffuse three vessel disease. The LMCA was free from
angiographically-apparent disease. The LAD was diffusely
diseased at mid-vessel (70-80%) and the D1 was diffusely
diseased proximally (70-80%). The LCX was a large vessel. The
OM1 and OM2 were severely and diffusely diseased vessels and the
OM3 (likely a good target for grafting) was a good size vessel
with proximal 70% stenosis. The RCA was totally occluded at the
ostium with robust left-to-right collaterals.
2- Limited resting hemodynamic assessment revealed severe
systemic
arterial hypertension (220/103 mmHg). Nitroglycerine gtt was
started for better BP control.
3- Left ventriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Consult cardiothoracic surgery for CABG.

or sudden death.

EKG demonstrated NSR, NA/NI with no significant change compared
with prior dated [**2167-4-1**].
TELEMETRY demonstrated: NSR
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2166-9-15**] demonstrated:  The left
atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-5mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV
diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
