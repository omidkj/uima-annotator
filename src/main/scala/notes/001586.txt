Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
diverticulitis s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3379**] pouch on [**12-4**]


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L IJ central line placement

History of Present Illness:
79 yo female with was initially admitted on [**12-1**] to [**Hospital1 **] because of increasing abdominal pain.  She was
initially treated with antibiotics, but then underwent
exploratory laporotomy on the [**12-4**] with lysis of adhesions,
repair of an enterocolic fistula and perforated sigmoid colon
from diverticulitis with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3379**] pouch. The procedure was
uncomplicated and the intraoperative blood loss was estimated to
be 200cc. She was treated with Ceftazidime and Flagyl
postoperatively.
Notes are indicating positive liquid stool on [**12-7**]. On [**12-8**] she
was noted to  be tachycardic, tachypneic and had an increased
temperature. Her WBC was newly elevated to 16.6. On [**12-9**] she was
intubated because of difficult breathing. An infection was
suspected and the patient was changed to Vanco, Zosyn and
Flagyl. She was found to have tachycardia and elevated troponin.
A CXR showed signs of congestive heart failure. An EKG was read
as old RBBB, lef ant hemiblock, sinus tachycardia and diffuse
ST-T changes. Elevated troponin was considered to be demand
versus NSTEMI. Lasix was given for pulm edema.
A CT of the chest was done and showed bilateral pleural
effusions with bibasialr atelectasis as well as multifocal RUL
subsegmental opacities concerning for pneumonitis. CT of the
abdomen showed a fluid collection between the anterior
peritoneal reflection and the transverse colon with two small
gas bubbles, possible postoperative seroma. Also 15cm inferior
fluid collection extending into the pelvis without signs of
infection, possible seroma. No bowel ischemia or evidence of
infection. 1.5 cm focus in the liver is likely a cyst.`
Troponin I continued to trend up from 0.01 on [**12-5**] to 1.98 on
[**12-9**]. Also AST was found to be elevated at 1163. INR was
elevated.
Postoperatively she developed decreased urine output with stable
BUN and creatinine, thought to be due to prerenal etiology with
a component of acute tubular necrosis from volume depletion/
decreased cardiac output in the context of an MI and toxicity
from contrast. A renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction.

CXR [**12-9**]
1.  Lines and tubes as described above.  Nasogastric tube needs
advancement as its tip is at the gastroesophageal junction.
2.  Mild pulmonary edema.
3.  Retrocardiac left lower lobe opacity could represent
atelectasis or
consolidation
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle.  Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed. Tissue  velocity imaging E/e' is elevated
(>15) suggesting increased left ventricular  filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include severe hypokinesis of the entire mid to distal LV with
apical and  anterior wall akinesis. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion  are normal, but the RV apex may be
hypokinetic. The aortic valve leaflets (3)  appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic  regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation
is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no  pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w
multivessel coronary artery disease. No LV thrombus is
appreciated. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and mild
mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis:
1.  Several small mesenteric fluid pockets, too small for
percutaneous
drainage.  No drainable fluid collection.
2.  Diffuse bowel wall thickening, which is of uncertain
clinical significance in the setting of recent bowel surgery and
mesenteric fluid.
3.  Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Superimposed
pneumonia cannot be excluded by imaging.
4.  Bilateral adrenal fullness.
5.  Scoliosis and spondylosis with grade 1 anterior listhesis at
L3/4 and
L5/S1.
.
EKG: SR, HR 90, RBBB, LAFB, TWI in V3-V6, I, II and aVL.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo diverticulitis s/p hartmann operation c/b post-operative
fever, leukocytosis and elevated troponin with subsequent
reintunation for respiratory distress.
.
# Respiratory failure: multifactorial with component of
infection given RUL, RML infiltrate, as well as evidence of
pulmonary edema. A PE was considered low likelyhood. CVP on
admission was low suggesting against R heart failure. ECHO
showed EF of 20% with severe MR, leading to pulmonary edema. She
was empirically started on Vanco/ZOsyn, mainly for possible
intraabdominal infection but also treating a possible PNA
underlying the pulmonary edema. LENIs were negative for DVT
suggesting against a PE as an etiology. The patient was
aggressively diuresed over severeal days and was slowly weaned
from the vent. She was extubated on the 7 and tolerated it well.
She was mainainted on 2lO2 postextubation.
.
# SIRS: pt with leukocytosis, temperature spike at OSH,
tachypnea, meets [**3-7**] criteria for SIRS. Possible infection could
be pulmonary, given CT findings. Also, intrabdominal infection
postoperatively needs to be considered. While CT of the abdomen
did not show any abscess it was not an ideal study with
contrast. No evidence of wound infection. POssible line sepsis.
Central line was resited. All cultures were negative. The
patient was given Vanco+Zosyn for a ten day course as
recommended by surgery.
.
# Acute myocardial infarction before transfer: likely MI several
days prior. Eccho with Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w multivessel coronary artery disease. No LV
thrombus is appreciated. Moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension. Cardiology was consulted, and she was started on
afterload redcution for severe mitral regurgitation as well as
metoprolol and Plavix (Aspirin-allergic)
.
# ARF: most likely prerenal from borderline hypotension,
possible poor cardiac froward flow, early sepsis. Also possible
component of ATN. Continues to maintain good urine flow.
Creatinine improved rapidly.
.
# Elevated INR: likely depletion of Vitamin K. No evidence of
DIC as fibrinogen elevated. Vitamin K was given.
.
