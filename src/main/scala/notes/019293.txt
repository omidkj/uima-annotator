HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88 year old female
with a history of mitral regurgitation by echocardiogram
noted in [**2115-3-16**], and also with known congestive heart
failure history.  The patient had an echocardiogram on
admission which showed a 60% left anterior descending disease
and severe mitral regurgitation.  The patient was preopped
for mitral valve repair and coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Macular degeneration.
3.  Headaches.
4.  Multiple premature ventricular contractions.
5.  Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past surgical history
includes an appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and shellfish.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a white blood cell count of
5.3, hematocrit 32.0, platelet count 190,000.  INR was 1.2.
The patient's electrolytes revealed a sodium 141, potassium
3.3, blood urea nitrogen 28, creatinine 0.7, glucose 103.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a mitral valve repair
and a coronary artery bypass graft using saphenous vein graft
to left anterior descending.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well.  Nutrition was consulted and felt that the
patient would need tube feedings to supplement poor p.o.
intake.  Neurology was consulted for right upper extremity
paresis which was noted.  Suspicion for acute stroke versus
reexpression of an old lesion due to toxic metabolic factors.
Head CT was done which was negative.  The patient continued
to be stable neurologically.  Neurology felt the patient
would recover completely with aggressive physical therapy and
occupational therapy.  A speech and swallow evaluation was
done.  The patient was placed on aspiration precautions, but
again doing better with p.o. intake.  The patient was
eventually transferred to the floor on postoperative day
seven.  The decision was made to not institute
anticoagulation.  The patient's tube feeding was discontinued
in order to try to stimulate more p.o. intake on the
patient's behalf.  It worked pretty well to an extent.
Gerontology consultation was obtained and a number of
recommendations were made.  The patient continued to work
with physical therapy and occupational therapy,  By
postoperative day ten, the patient was with good pain control
and able to tolerate a good amount of soft solids and doing
relatively well with physical therapy.  The patient was felt
to be ready for discharge from a cardiac standpoint.  The
patient is to be following up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in four weeks
