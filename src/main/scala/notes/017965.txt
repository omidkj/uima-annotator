Service:  CCU

HOSPITAL COURSE PRIOR TO TRANSFER TO CARDIAC CARE UNIT:  Upon
presentation to the cardiac care unit team, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a
51-year-old woman who had been admitted to the vascular
surgery service on [**2109-8-28**] for a left heel ulcer.  She
underwent a femoral to posterior tibial bypass on [**2109-9-2**].
Her postoperative course was complicated by pulmonary edema
and decreased urine output.  Her CK and troponin levels were
elevated with a troponin of greater than 40.  Her peak first
CK was measured at 305.  The patient received a cardiac
catheterization on [**2109-9-4**] and had a left anterior
descending artery stent placed.  Her other coronary arteries
were normal during the cardiac catheterization.

Since that time, the patient had remained intubated with a
Swan catheter in the surgical intensive care unit.  An
echocardiogram on [**2109-9-5**] showed an ejection fraction of 35%
with apical, septal and anterior hypokinesis.  The patient
has required inotropic support, dopamine and Levophed.  She
also had decreased urine output and elevated creatinine.  She
was transferred to the cardiac care unit for further
evaluation and treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history was
significant for diabetes mellitus type 1,
hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, coronary artery
disease, pernicious anemia, status post appendectomy and
status post cesarean section.

MEDICATIONS:  Her outpatient medications had been Avapro,
vitamin B-12, Cardizem, calcium with vitamin D, colchicine,
Diamox, folate, potassium chloride, Lasix, Lipitor,
Neurontin, nitroglycerin patch, Plavix, Prevacid, Epogen,
cisapride, magnesium, Synthroid and Xanax.  She was also on
aspirin, Zantac, subcutaneous heparin, levofloxacin, heparin
drip, Levophed and dopamine drips and Dilaudid upon
presentation to the cardiac care unit.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The social history was negative for tobacco
use, alcohol use or recreational drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs showed a temperature of
37.7??????C, a blood pressure of 115/40, a pulse of 82,
respirations of 13 and an oxygen saturation of 99% on assist
control ventilation with a rate of 11, tidal volume of 700,
FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 10.  In general, the patient was
intubated and sedated.  The pupils were equal, round and
reactive to light and accommodation.  There were scattered
rhonchi on chest examination.  The heart was a regular rate
and rhythm with a II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left
upper sternal border.  The abdomen was obese, nontender and
nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.  The
extremities had 1+ edema.  On neurological examination, the
patient responded to painful stimuli and remained sedated.

LABORATORY:  Upon admission to the cardiac care unit, the
patient had a white blood cell count of 19,000, a hematocrit
of 30, an INR of 1.4, BUN and creatinine of 48 and 2.8, CK of
66 and troponin of greater than 50.  Her arterial blood gases
upon admission to the cardiac care unit revealed a pH of
7.26, a pCO2 of 39 and a pO2 of 97 and a bicarbonate of 18.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
CARDIOPULMONARY:  The patient was found to be in severe
pulmonary edema.  She received multiple doses of intravenous
Lasix and diuresed approximately three liters per day over
the course of a week.  She was finally extubated after three
failed trials of pressor support on [**2109-9-14**].  She was
stable for transfer to the floor on [**2109-9-15**], but no
medications were available.  Therefore, she went to the floor
on [**2109-9-16**].  While in the hospital, her chest x-ray cleared
significantly. She initially presented with severe bilateral
pulmonary edema.  Her chest x-ray upon transfer to the floor
revealed mild bilateral alveolar opacities.

As far as her pump was concerned, she received Lopressor,
Aldactone and Univasc for treatment of her congestive heart
failure with an ejection fraction of approximately 35%.
Regarding her coronary arteries, she had the stent placed and
received aspirin and Plavix.  Niacin was started for a low
HDL.  She had no issues with her rhythm.  The pulmonary edema
resolved.  However, the patient still had atelectasis, which
improved with ambulation and incentive spirometry.

ENDOCRINE:  The patient had issues with an elevated blood
glucose; however, she was switched to her regular regimen
from home.  This regimen included lente and Ultralente with
Humalog coverage and her blood glucose remained in the low
100s after this change was made on [**2109-9-16**].

PSYCHIATRY:  The patient had a psychiatric consultation and
TSH and RPR were normal.  B-12 and folate were still pending.
However, her mood improved significantly after she was
transferred to the floor and extubated.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is currently stable.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be transferred most likely to
[**Hospital6 1293**] in [**Location (un) 1294**] or perhaps to
another rehabilitation facility, possibly on oxygen and on
the following medications:  atenolol, Zantac, Lasix 80 mg
p.o. q.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d., Norvasc 10 mg p.o.
q.d., Ambien, Univasc 30 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin, Plavix,
Neurontin, Synthroid, vitamin B-12, Nystatin swish and
swallow, Prozac, her usual regimen of lente and Ultralente
with lispro Humalog coverage and niacin 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
