ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname 41672**] is an 83-year-
old woman, with a history of congestive heart failure, who
was found to have aortic stenosis during her cardiac work-up,
for which she was scheduled to have elective repair. She had
had multiple admissions to the hospital for exacerbations of
her congestive heart failure. She also notably had increasing
episodes of angina, and on her cardiac catheterization was
found to have 60% disease of her right coronary, 30% disease
of the diagonal, and 80% to the PDA, with an ejection
fraction of 60%. Her aortic valve area was about 0.3 cm to
0.4 cm on her preoperative catheterization. Given her
constellation of symptoms and her multiple exacerbations, she
was admitted to the hospital for elective repair.

On her initial examination, her weight was 128 pounds, pulse
64 in sinus rhythm, with a blood pressure of 110/65. She was
otherwise satting 95% on room air. She was in no acute
distress. There was no significant JVD. Her lungs were clear.
Her heart was regular. She had a III/VI systolic ejection
murmur throughout the precordium. Her abdomen was otherwise
soft. She had no edema in the lower extremities. Her
hematocrit was 39, and her BUN and creatinine were 15 and
1.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  The patient was admitted to the
hospital on [**2189-2-18**], and on that same day underwent an
aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm CE tissue valve, and
also coronary artery bypass grafting x1 with saphenous vein
graft to the posterolateral branch of the right coronary
artery. Her cardiopulmonary bypass time was 102 minutes, and
her crossclamp time was 82 minutes. The patient was taken to
the cardiac surgery unit postoperatively.

1. NEUROLOGICALLY: The patient did quite well. She had no
   episodes of confusion or agitation, and had adequate pain
   control with a combination of narcotic medications in the
   initial postoperative period, followed by Tylenol and
   ibuprofen as needed.

1. RESPIRATORY: The patient's respiratory status was quite
   tenuous during the course of her hospitalization. She did
   well initially post extubation on postoperative day 1, but
   by postoperative day 4, she began to have worsening oxygen
   saturation with increased work of breathing, and was found
   to be in mild respiratory acidosis with hypercarbia. Her
   chest film. showed bilateral pleural effusions with some
   evidence of CHF. She was subsequently transferred to the
   intensive care unit for more aggressive monitoring and, in
   fact, required BIPAP ventilation. Her pleural effusions
   were drained via insertion of pigtail catheters. She put
   out a significant amount of fluid when the pigtails were
   inserted, with approximately 1,200 cc coming out from the
   right chest, and another 350 cc coming out from the left
   chest when the catheters were inserted. Her respiratory
   status stabilized after insertion of these catheters, and
   she began to improve subsequently after more aggressive
   diuresis was started.

The remainder of her hospitalization was notable for
significant output from the right and left chest tubes of 500
cc to 1,000 cc per day. Analysis of this fluid revealed it to
be a transudate without any evidence of an infective process.
The drainage catheters were left in place for 2 weeks, but at
that time there was only about 100 cc to 200 cc of fluid
draining from these catheters and; therefore, it was
determined that they should be removed. She subsequently did
reaccumulate some fluid, but the effusions were stable and
well-controlled with diuretics. She did not require
reintubation postoperatively, and her respiratory acidosis
did improve. The pulmonology critical care service was
consulted for assessment of these effusions, and they felt
that these were likely secondary to her congestive heart
failure. They felt that there was no evidence of amiodarone
toxicity contributing to her pulmonary status. By the time of
her discharge, Ms. [**Known lastname 41672**] was satting 94% on room air. She
was otherwise not dyspneic. She did have some decreased
breath sounds at the bases with the presence of mild
bilateral pleural effusions which had been stable on serial
chest imaging. To note, there was some question as to whether
these effusions may have been secondary to nonspecified
postcardiotomy syndrome.

1. CARDIOVASCULAR: On postoperative day 0, the patient
   experienced brief runs of nonsustained ventricular
   tachycardia, at which time amiodarone was started, but
   after the immediate postoperative period, these episodes
   resolved. She had been in atrial fibrillation in the past
   but, in fact, remained in sinus rhythm throughout the
   course of her hospitalization. Her congestive heart
   failure was managed with aggressive diuresis and afterload
   reduction with ACE inhibitors. There was a question as to
   whether her pleural effusions were secondary to congestive
   heart failure from a problem with her aortic valve, for
   which she underwent repeat echocardiography. Her repeat
   echocardiogram showed that her ejection fraction was
   normal at greater than 65%. Her aortic valve had a
   prosthetic which was seated in good position, but had
   somewhat of an increased gradient present. There was 1+
   mitral regurgitation. Her aortic valve mean gradient was
   36 mm. It was not felt that the valve was responsible for
   her recurrent pleural effusions. Her CHF, as noted, was
   managed with a combination of beta blockers and ACE
   inhibitors. We added calcium channel blockers for some
   time after consultation with congestive heart failure
   service, but prior to her discharge it was felt that the
   combination of beta blockade and ACE inhibitor alone would
   be adequate for her control, along with diuretics. She
   never had any evidence of postoperative cardiac ischemia,
   and her bypass graft seemed to be functioning well.

Prior to her discharge, as noted, she was in sinus rhythm on
a stable dose of beta blocker and ACE inhibitor with
amiodarone. Her Coumadin was not restarted, as she had
remained in sinus rhythm, and otherwise not reverted to
atrial fibrillation, and also due to the fact that there was
concern that there might be some risk of instability while
walking, or falls while on anticoagulation.

1. GASTROINTESTINAL: No major issues.

1. FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: The patient was, as
   noted, significantly volume overloaded in the initial
   postoperative period. First, she was diuresed
   aggressively. She remained mildly volume overloaded
   throughout the course o
