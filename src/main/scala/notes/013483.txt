Attending:[**Last Name (un) 2888**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for acute on chronic systolic heart failure and
ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization lab for epicardial lead placement which
was unsuccesful [**2128-8-3**]
cardiac surgery for Upgrade of VVI-ICD to biventricular-pacer-
ICD with addition of epicardial left ventricular pacing lead
and transvenous atrial lead, cardioversion [**2128-8-4**]
cardioversion on [**2128-8-9**]

History of Present Illness:
70 F history of ischemic cardiomyopathy ([**Hospital1 **]-V ICD placed 2 weeks
ago, EF 30%) presented to OSH on [**2128-7-19**] for acute on chronic
systolic heart failure and ventricular tachycardia.
Pt had recent hosptialization ([**Hospital 931**] hospital--> [**Hospital1 498**])
[**Date range (1) 23794**] for pulmonary edema vs pneumonia requiring intubation,
lasix and ceftriaxone. She was extubated after brief period.
Pt presented back to [**Hospital 931**] hospital on [**7-19**] with
nausea/emesis/ epigastric pain.
V tach: on prsentation to OSH she found to be in V Tach at rate
of 160-170s. She was alert during this time, SBP 80s. Amiodarone
was given but no conversion. She was then cardioverted and
shocked back to NSR. (Despite ICD being in place, it did not go
off.) Last night she was in A fib then converted to sinus. This
morning, she was found to be in V tach again, sp shock then
given amiodarone gtt starting this AM. She remained in NSR since
then.
Acute systolic Heart failure: Pt found to be in pulmonary edema
and was given lasix 60mg PO. Echo at OSH showed on [**7-21**]: EF 30%
(2 weeks ago)--> LVEF [**10-25**] %. Apical akinesis and thinning,
anterior and inferior akinesis and thinning.
During hospitalization, she was hypotensive (SBP 80-90s) with
leukocytosis (WBC 23) and was given vancomycin and zosyn for
broad empiric coverage.
She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of CHF and VTach.
In the ambulance to [**Hospital1 18**] she was initialy satting well on 2 L.
However, she suddenly became SOB and required a non-rebreather.
No clear precipitant as EMS reports BP and HR overall stable
during transfer. No episodes of VT. Her arms and legs were cold
with BP in the 80s. On arrival to the CCU, pt looked ill, was in
respiratory distress. She was transitioned to BIPAP 100%. CXR
was performed and showed pulmonary edema. She was given lasix
60mg IV once with minimal UO. She was then given 100mg IV
followed by lasix gtt.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Severe
regional LV systolic dysfunction. Estimated cardiac index is
depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No LV mass/thrombus. No resting LVOT
gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels.
AORTIC VALVE: No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mild (1+) MR. LV inflow pattern c/w restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated LA pressure.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal PA systolic pressure.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to
position. Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, septal and
apical akinesis. There is moderate hypokinesis of the remaining
segments (LVEF = 15-20%). The estimated cardiac index is
depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta
at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There is no
