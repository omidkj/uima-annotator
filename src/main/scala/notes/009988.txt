Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Bloody sputum for 5 days, post-bronchoscopy respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**7-13**]: Bronchoscopy - only suction trauma visualized, no source
of bleeding found.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 108855**] is a very pleasant 84 y/o male with a h/o colon
cancer s/p resection and radiation, CAD s/p stents, systolic CHF
with EF 40-45%, dilated cardiomyopathy, afib, h/o cardiac arrest
and complete heart block now with pacer/AICD, and history of GI
bleed secondary to duodenal telangiectasia who is here from
rehab following evaluation of blood in his respiratory
secretions.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 108855**] had a lengthy, complex, and recent admission to
the TICU which is summarized in brief. He had a fall on [**2163-6-23**],
leading to multiple rib fractures. He had L 1-10th rib frx, R
5-7th rib frx, L hemothorax decompressed by pigtail catheter,
and a L distal clavicle fracture. He was given a tracheostomy
and PEG tube after failed extubation and reintubation.
.
In rehab, the patient was noted to have blood tinged secretions
via his trach. A bronschoscopy was performed and reportedly saw
bleeding inside of his trachea with poor visualization. He was
transfused 2 unit pRBC and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Here, the
patient reports no resp distress. His wife stated that the pt
has been stable with no change in his respiration.
.
He underwent a bronchoscopy with our [**Hospital1 18**] group on [**7-13**], which
did not find an etiology of the bleed. Only suction trauma was
seen. Of note, he was receiving intermittent lasix and IVF for
hypernatremia prior to bronchoscopy. Post-procedure, he was
noted to be mildly tachypnic with RR 30s and was satting 88% on
15L NC. As such, he was transferred to the medical ICU for
closer monitoring. Of note, he is typically on 50% FIO2 with his
trach mask.

[**7-19**] CXR: Slightly rotated positioning. A tracheostomy tube is in
place. A left-sided dual-lead pacemaker is in place, with lead
tips over right atrium and right ventricle.  There is moderately
severe cardiomegaly, with left lower lobe collapse and/or
consolidation. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse
vascular blurring, suggestive of mild CHF. There is focal patchy
opacity in the left mid zone, which could reflect atelectasis or
a pneumonic infiltrate. There is a small left and possible
minimal right effusion. Minimal atelectasis right base. The hila
are enlarged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 108855**] is a 84 y/o male with colon cancer s/p resection
and radiation, CAD s/p stents, systolic CHF with EF 40-45%,
dilated cardiomyopathy, afib, h/o cardiac arrest and complete
heart block now with pacer/AICD, and history of GI bleed
secondary to duodenal telangiectasia who is here from rehab for
hemoptysis. Of note, he had lengthy TICU hospitalization for L
1-10th rib fractures, R 5-7th rib fractures, a L hemothorax, a L
dist clavicle fracture, and he is s/p trach and peg.
.
# Hemoptysis: Mr. [**Known lastname 108855**] was noted to have blood tinged
secretions via his trach. An OSH bronschoscopy was performed and
reportedly saw bleeding inside the trachea with poor
visualization. He was transfused 2 units of pRBC and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**]. Here, he reported no resp distress. He is status post
bronchoscopy with our pulmonary team on [**7-13**], which did not find
an etiology of the bleed. Only suction trauma was seen, and this
may be the primary etiology of his bloody tracheal secretions.
While the cause of his hemoptysis remains uncertain, his
hematocrits have remained stable and there are no signs of
continuing hemoptysis or active bleeding. Chemical DVT ppx was
held at time of discharge after he was HIT positive and given
risk of bleeding with suction trauma.
.
# Respiratory distress: His respiratory distress has
currentlyimproved. Post bronchoscopy, he was noted to be mildly
tachypnic with RR 30s and was 88% on 15L NC. A CXR showed
worsening pulmonary edema, and he received lasix with
improvement in PACU. He was transferred to the MICU for closer
monitoring. Of note, he was receiving intermittent lasix and an
IVF bolus prior to bronchoscopy. He is typically on 50% FIO2
with his trach mask. He was weaned from the ventilator, and was
continued on albuterol MDIs. He was also treated with vancomycin
and cefepime for HCAP, until his sputum Cx grew coag-positive
