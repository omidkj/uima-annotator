HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was scheduled for a vaginal

vaginal hysterectomy.  Please see the full operative report
for the details of the procedure.  The surgery was
complicated by adhesions of the [**Last Name (un) **] to the uterus and about
the uterus.  Therefore, the surgery was converted to
abdominal total hysterectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy,
and lysis of adhesions, as well as cystoscopy.

In addition, the surgery was complicated by significant
amount of bleeding of approximately 2.5 liters for which she
received four units of packed red blood cells as well as a
large amount of volume of intravenous fluids
intraoperatively.  Given the complex nature of the surgery
she was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring
postoperatively.

Her vitals on admission to the ICU were stable, and her exam
was notable for mild soft tissue swelling as well as clear
lungs.  Heart was regular, and her incision had a dry
dressing.  Her hematocrits were checked every six hours with
the goal of transfusing for hematocrit less than 30.  She was
started on regular insulin sliding scale for her diabetes.
Her home medications were continued for her bipolar disorder,
and her blood pressure was followed per routine.  She was
started on subcutaneous Heparin and Pneumoboots as well as
Protonix for prophylaxis.  She remained intubated immediately
postoperatively.

On postoperative day one she remained in stable condition and
was extubated early in the morning of postoperative day one.
She had no complications and was symptomatically appropriate
for her first postoperative day.  She was afebrile with
stable vital signs.  Her hematocrit postoperatively was 36.3,
and her coagulation profile and electrolytes were within
normal limits.  She was transferred to the regular
postoperative floor on postoperative day one.

She continued to do well and remained stable on postoperative
day two.  She had ambulated times four on postoperative day
one and had no new complaints.  She was diuresing
appropriately and was given her oral dose of Lasix by
intravenous to enhance her diuresis.  She continued on her
insulin sliding scale until tolerating full diet.  She
remained on the rest of her home medications.

On postoperative day three she again continued to do well.
She remained on the continuous positive air pressure for her
obstructive sleep apnea per her home regimen.  Her blood
pressures remained stable, and she was started on her ACE
inhibitor and transitioned to oral Lasix.  In addition, her
oral diabetic drugs, Metformin and Avandia, were started.
