Bactrim / Demerol / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2108**]
Chief Complaint:
Trach irritation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy decanulation

History of Present Illness:
59 yoF w/ a h/o DMII, HTN, CKD and recent MVC w/ multiple
orthpedic fractures and prolonged SICU course 1 month ago
including trach placement presented initially on [**2132-6-18**] with
irritation at her trach site which had just been downsized.  In
the ER the patient was noted to have a + u/a and was given a
dose of levofloxacin, in addition blood cultures were drawn and
the patient underwent a CTA (as her trach irritation caused some
tachypnea) which was negative for PE or infiltrate and only
revealed atelectasis.

The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] as she had a trach and was
on a trach collar and general surgery was consulted regarding
the trach irritation, given that she no longer seemed dependent
on the trach she was decannulated and gauze was placed over the
trach site.

In addition the patient was noted to have grown 2/4 bottles Coag
negative staph- treatment was not initiated in the ICU, unclear
if the blood culture was from peripheral blood or from the PICC
line.  The patient was maintained on a liquid diet (as she
passed a speech and swallow study at rehab) and was given lasix
for some mild pulmonary edema (had been on 40mg po lasix daily
for diastolic dysfunction).  The patient was doing well and
called out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the medical floor.

[**5-30**], perc gastrostomy tube placed [**2132-6-2**] and prophylactic IVC
filter placement on [**2132-6-3**] (LENIs negative).  In addition the
patient was readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-6**] for altered mental

CTA CHEST [**2132-6-18**]
1. Limited study; however, no central pulmonary embolism is
identified.
Suboptimal evaluation of the segmental and subsegmental
branches.

2. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with
near complete
left lower lobe collapse, increased from the prior examination.

CXR [**2132-6-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Left basilar
atelectasis and small effusion. Infection at the left base
cannot be excluded.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Question of worsening effusion or new
infiltrate.

FINDINGS:
There is thoracic spinal fixation. Heart is top normal in size.
There is
mild congestive failure. There is continued left lower lobe
atelectasis as
well as small bilateral pleural effusions and right lower lobe
atelectasis.  Very little change since prior study

ANKLE X RAY [**2132-6-25**]: healing calcaneal fracture


Brief Hospital Course:
BACTERMIA: Had a mid line which was a possible source for
infection.  Treated with vancomycin, will need to continue
vancomycin 1g IV bid for total 14 day course, last day [**7-2**].

TRACHEOSTOMY: Decannuled without issue. Likely will close within
1-2 weeks.

ACUTE ON CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE:  Manifest mainly by
bilateral pleural effusions, contribution also from low albumin.
 Treated with furosemide twice daily and blood pressure control.


HYPERTENSION, BENIGN ESSENTIAL: well controlled on following
regimen: clonidine 0.2mg po tid, lisinopril 40mg daily,
amlodipine 10mg po daily and metoprolol 100mg po tid.

TYPE II DM: Uncontrolled with complications.  Continued on
insulin glargine 55 units sc qhs, and sliding scale insulin.
She was on tube feeds on a rate of 45cc/hr, this was cut to 25
cc/hr, this should be cut in half again on [**6-26**] then
discontinued on [**6-26**] if nutritional intake improves (which it
has been).  Insulin may need to be adjusted during the tube feed
titration.

FOLEY CATHETER ASSOCIATED UTI: Patient had a foley, GNR >
100,000 w/ nitrites and leuk esterase, only 0-2 WBCs.  Treated
with ciprofloxacin initially, culture resistent so started on
ceftriaxone and will continue for 7 day course, last dose 7/18.

RIGHT ANKLE AND BIMALLEOLAR FRACTURE: healing well on repeat X
ray on [**6-25**], can advance weight bearing status to partial weight
bearing and follow up with orthopedics.  (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

S/P SPINAL FUSION:  Staples removed on [**2132-6-20**].  Follow up with
orthopedic spine.  ([**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1352**])

HYPOTHYROIDISM: Continued levothyroxine 88mcg daily
