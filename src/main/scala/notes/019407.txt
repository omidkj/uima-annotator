ESOPHAGEAL STUDY [**7-30**]
No evidence of obstruction or perforation. Prompt oral contrast
passage into the stomach

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW [**7-30**]
1. Mild penetration with thin barium, but no aspiration.
2. Persistent opacity posterior to the upper esophagus,
incompletely assessed in the current study.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the [**Location 63928**] general surgery service
on [**2122-7-24**] and
had repair of a recurrent Zenker's diverticulum.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the PACU in
stable condition prior to transfer to CC6.

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received intermittent
morphine IV with good effect and adequate pain control.  When
intubated patient sedated with propofol which was weaned for
extubation.  Following extubation POD5 pt noted to have L facial
droop.  Neurology intensivist evaluated patient and felt that
this was related to the surgery and would likely be
self-limited. When tolerating oral intake, the patient was
transitioned to oral pain medications.

Electorlites: Patient electrolites were checked, requiring
potassium supplementation.

CV: Patient was placed on lopressor IV postop.  Home meds were
resumed; vital
signs were routinely monitored, they were stable during her
hospitalization in the floor.

Pulmonary: Patient had episode on tongue swelling temporally
associated with unasyn administration on POD1.  Benadryl IV was
given and tongue swelling returned to nearly baseline.  A second
dose of benadryl IV was given POD1 PM for minimal residual
tongue swelling.  On AM of POD2, patient became acutely short of
breath on ambulation from bathroom to bed.  Nurse called team to
bed and very quickly patient became unstable with increasing
peri-oral swelling and inability to effectively ventilate.  A
code was called just prior to arrival of house staff.  Code team
arrived and ACLS protocol engaged.  Epinephrine administered
given history of angioedema.  Patient emergently intubated via
awake fiber-optic intubation for inability to ventilate.
Patient was taken emergently to SICU.  Upon arrival,
bronchoscopy was performed which showed significant angioedema.
Steroids initiated POD2.  Persistent lack of cuff leak prompted
addition of benadryl POD3.  Steroids changed from dexamethasone
to methylprednisolone POD4.  Pt was extubated POD5.

Pulmonary toilet including incentive spirometry and early
ambulation were encouraged.  The patient was stable from a
pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was kept NPO and given IV
fluids until tolerating oral intake.  Patient extubated POD5 and
pt evaluated by speech & swallow.  Given facial droop POD5, S&S
decided to perform video swallow study POD6 which showed.
Peri-incisional JP drain was removed.  Her diet was slowing
advanced to regular which was tolerated well.

ID: Post-operatively, the patient was kept on Unasyn given
nature of diverticulotomy/repair.  This was changed to
cipro/flagyl IV on POD1 per question of allergic reaction as
above.  Antibiotics were discontinued POD4. The patient's
temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

Swallowing: Esophageal barium study was perform, no evidence of
obstruction or perforation. Prompt oral contrast passage into
the stomach. Speach and swallow evaluated the patient, they
recommended soft solids and nectar thick liquids which she
tolerated  very well. A swallowing study was repeated on [**8-3**],
it showed penetration of thin and nectar thick liquids during
the swallow as well as backflow
of liquids and purees from the esophagus into the airway after
the swallow, Full liquid diet was recommended. Nutrition consult
for patient education was given to the patient. She understand
the risk of aspiration. She will follow up with speach and
swallow if any concer. She will be d/c with VNA Swallowing
therapy and Physical Therapy. Her daughter was informed of this
risk of aspiration.

Physical teraphy worked with her during her hospitalization, she
is able to walk with walker. Patient was d/c with physical
therapy services at home and continue O2 suplementation.

At the time of discharge on POD 10 the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.
