Brief Hospital Course:
58M h/o COPD, HCV, polysubstance abuse admitted to ICU for
hypoglycemia, EtOH intoxication, and possible seizure.
.
# Hypoglycemia: Likely due to starvation and EtOH leading to
decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis. Decreased carbohydrate intake
also reduces insulin and increases glucagon secretion. Anion-gap
17 but urine from ED notable for absence of ketones. Other
etiologies includes exogenous use of insulin, renal failure and
hypothyroidism. Patient denies use of insulin or any
anti-hyperglycemic drugs, renal function is within normal
limits.  TSH was within normal range at 1.0.  He was given D5NS
fluid and his blood glucose was followed; hypoglycemia did not
recur.
.
# EtOH intoxication/Withdrawal: He had an ETOH level of 215 on
presentation.  he was monitored for evidence of etoh withdrawal;
this did not recur.
.
# Seizure: Unclear if actual seizure vs. acute intoxication. If
true seizure, possibly EtOH withdrawal vs. hypoglycemia vs.
other toxic-metabolic cause. No evidence brain mass or CNS
infection was noted on imaging or LP.  EEG was normal.
.
# Head trauma: Imaging negative for fracture or bleed.
.
# COPD: stable on inhalers.
.
# PTSD/depression: Continued on trazodone and zoloft.
.
# pt. complained of rt. ankle pain at the site of his PIV which
had been there.  No evidence of infection, plain films neg. for
fracture.
