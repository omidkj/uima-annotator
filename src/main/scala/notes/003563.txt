IMAGING:
CT/A Head [**1-12**]:
CT HEAD: There has been interval increase in diffuse
subarachnoid hemorrhage within the frontal, temporal, and
parietal lobes, left greater than right, and extending within
the sylvian fissures. There is a new large intraparenchymal
hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe, measuring 6.5 cm
anteroposterior x 3.1 cm transverse with associated surrounding
hypodensity. There is new mass effect upon the entire left
lateral ventricle with approximately 6 mm midline shift to the
right. There is effacement of the frontal and occipital horns of
the left lateral ventricle. Additional note is made of
intraventricular blood products layering within the occipital
horns, unchanged. There is evidence of
left uncal herniation and transfalcine herniation. No acute
territorial
infarction is identified. Incidental note is made of a mucus
retention cyst within the left maxillary sinus. The remaining
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
CTA HEAD: The patient is intubated. The vertebrobasilar system
is
unremarkable. There is a 3 mm aneurysm at the left M3 segment.
There is a 1.5 mm left posterior communicating artery aneurysm
and a 2.1 mm anterior
communicating artery aneurysm. No additional aneurysms are
identified. The
intracranial internal carotid, anterior, middle, and posterior
cerebral
arteries demonstrate a normal course and caliber without
evidence of high-
grade stenosis, occlusion, or arteriovenous malformation.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of a large left intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with new mass effect, rightward midline shift, left
uncal herniation, and tranfalcine herniation. Interval increase
in diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular
extension.
2. 3 mm left M3 aneurysm, 2 mm anterior communicating artery
aneurysm, and
1.5 mm left posterior communicating artery aneurysm.

CT Head [**1-12**](Post-op):
FINDINGS: The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy
with surgical
staples seen in the scalp. Expected pneumocephalus and gas
within the
operative site is seen. High-density material in the left M2/3
region likely represents clips. Rightward shift is 5 mm, similar
to prior. Intraparenchymal and diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage
appears grossly similar. Slightly more hemorrhaging material
layers in the occipital horns. Effacement of the left lateral
ventricle and overlying sulci appear similar to prior. Mastoid
air cells are clear. Visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate
mild ethmoidal sinus mucosal thickening.
IMPRESSION: Status post left craniotomy, clot evacuation and
aneurysm
clipping with expected postoperative changes including
pneumocephalus. Overall similar rightward midline shift,
intraparenchymal and diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital6 2561**] on
[**2180-1-12**] s/p experiencing word finding difficulties and severe
sudden onset headache which caused him to lie down and be
unarousable by his wife.  Upon arrival he underwent cerebral
angiogram, followed by Left craniotomy for Left MCA aneurysm
clipping with placement of subgaleal [**Last Name (un) 86529**] [**Location (un) 1662**] drain, and
then returned to the interventional neuroradiology suite for
another angiogram.

On [**2180-1-13**] he began to display posturing so an EVD was placed on
the right side. on [**1-14**] his exam remained stable and his
subgaleal JP drain was removed. Also a right subclavian central
line was placed by the surgical ICU team.

On [**1-14**], subgaleal drain was removed and patient was febrile to
102. Cultures have been sent. C. diff was also sent.On [**1-19**],
patient was observed to be febrile overnight to 101.4, cultures
have been sent and results from cultures on [**1-14**] were negative.
His EVD continues to be raised to 20 and open. Patient opens his
eyes spontaneously, R hemiplegia, no commands, but spontaneous
with L side.

He remaine din the ICU. On [**1-18**] a CTA was performed and stroke
neurology service was consulted for prognosis. There was a
family meeting. His c. diff sample was resulted as negative. On
[**1-20**] the EVD was clamped. The patient was attempting to follow
commands. He exhibited receptive aphasia.

On [**1-21**], the patient's family was agreeable to extubation and he
was made DNI. He surprisingly did well s/p extubation, as he had
spontaneous eye opening, purposeful movement with his L upper
extremity, and questionable command following. The family spent
the day of [**1-23**] deciding what level of care and intervention
they wanted for Mr. [**Known lastname 85007**] which was full care but DNR/DNI.
They have agreed to have a PEG placed. It was placed on [**2180-1-25**].
Tube feedings were started and were tappered up to goal.  He is
maintained NPO otherwise.  It was also noted that day that his
plt count bumped to 1.4 million.  Heme onc was contact[**Name (NI) **] for
recommendations.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4613**] recommended starting Hydrea at 250mg
daily with close monitoring of cbc with diff to be drawn q
monday/friday - they would like to see him back in the clinic in
[**12-4**] weeks after discharge.

On [**2180-1-27**] he was lethargic but afebrile.  WBC bumped from
12->20->16.  CT scan of the brai
