Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
unresponsive at HD

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 77 yo man with h/o longstanding HTN c/b ESRD, several
lacunar strokes, multivascular dementia with poor baseline
cognitive function, limited verbal ability and comprehension, as
well as poor memory, who presented with AMS today from his
outpatient dialysis center.
.
Per pt's wife and Neurology resident, pt had some agitation last
night, talking with his wife and pacing with walker. He finally

fell asleep around 3AM, awoke at 4AM for dialysis at 6:30,
slightly groggy but responding appropriately to his wife before
HD. Her received his usual dose of 50mg benadryl before
dialysis, and then slept through the entire dialysis, which is
unusual for him (last known "awake" time was 6:30AM). Following
dialysis, staff tried to wake him up with verbal and tactile
stim and he was unresponsive. Staff tried applying cold packs to
head, no response. BP was "high" and RR was 12 (other VS
unavailable). Wife tried to move his head which felt heavy and
stiff, and entire body looked stiff with no spontaneous mvmt. At
one point, wife tried to move him and he slapped her hand away,
thus wife thought he was "alright." However, was again
unresponsive, eyes closed just after this.
.
When EMS arrived, he had his eyes open and was looking around
initially, though unresponsive. In ER, still unresponsive, BG
found to be 49 - given 1amp d50, with no return to BL, thus CODE
STROKE called. Neuro arrival within 5 minutes, and initial NIHSS
score high in every category as pt unresponsive; TPA not given
as last well-time was 6:30AM (5.5 hrs ago) and not clear to be
stroke. Per Neuro recommendation, pt underwent head CT followed
by head MRI, both of which were unrevealing for etiology of his
AMS. He initially had 1mg Ativan given for possible Sz, and when
no response, he was loaded on IV dilaudid. Had bedside EEG in
the ER that did not show definite Sz activity, but Neuro
recommends continuing Dilantin. Also notable, pt had SBP in the
250s while in ED.
.
Per wife, the patient's baseline is: limited speech and
comprehension, walks with walker, brushes teeth and feeds self
but wife helps him with most other adls, including transfers. He
has some urinary and bowel incontinence at baseline. He has
complained of no (and wife has noticed no) f/c/cp/sob/uri
sx/gi/gu sx; he has chronic LBP and as usual took vicodin this
am. No visual, hearing, sp/sw problems, no new
weakness/numbness; has fallen (falls occ. at BL) but no head
trauma.

.
pCXR [**2190-12-11**]:
1. New retrocardiac opacity, which likely indicates pneumonia.
Atelectasis is a less likely diagnostic consideration.
2. Hypertensive configuration of the heart and aorta.
3. Indwelling dialysis catheter as above.
.
Brain MRI: No evidence of acute infarct.
MRA: Head MRA is somewhat limited by motion. There is no
evidence of vascular occlusion seen. There is diminished flow
signal intensity visualized in the intracranial arteries which
appears artifactual. The basilar artery flow void as well as the
basilar artery flow signal on source images is maintained.
IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited normal MRA of the head
.
head CT: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. No
significant change from [**2190-9-27**].
.
EEG: This is an abnormal EEG in the waking and sleeping states
due to the low voltage slow posterior rhythm as well as bursts
of
bilateral frontal 4 Hz slowing. This suggests an encephalopathic

pattern which may be seen with medications or toxic metabolic
abnormalities.
.
pCXR: Mild CHF with left greater than right small pleural
effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:
- CT, MRI/MRA, EEG all negative for acute pathology.  Etiology
of altered mental status thought to be multifactorial - 1)By
history patient took double of the usual dose of benadryl.
2)Patient found to be hypoglycemic.  3) Renal failure. 4)All
superimposed on baseline that per family is altered.
- Patient was intially started on dilantin but the etiology was
ultimately deemed not to be seizure.  The patient should see his
behavioral neurologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], for whether he should
restart this medication.
- Plan to go to dialysis [**2190-12-13**] with possible removal of
tunneled catheter if dialysis through fistula is successful.
- Elevated potassium was treated with good effect with
kayexalate, insulin and D-50.
- Patient was incidentally found to have a retrocardiac opacity
but was not treated because of lack of fever and normal white
blood cell count.
- Home were held on admission, but were subsequently restarted
and the blood pressure remained stable.

# AMS: unclear etiology although possible precipitants include
hypoglycemia, seizure, altered BP; Neurology was consulted, EEG
was performed and showed no seizure. Head CT and MRI/A were
unremarkable. Benadryl/trazodone were held. Mental status
improved to baseline per his family. Trazodone was held. He
should try to avoid >25 mg at a time of benadryl. Blood sugars
returned to [**Location 213**].
.
# CV: Had slight TnT bump though with no change in ECG and known
ESRD; ruled out for MI, no CP/SOB.

# HTN: became very hypertensive to >200/100, not controlled on
home meds, so patient was changed to labetalol 400 mg tid in
addition to his norvasc for better BP control, his BP improved
to 140/90.
.
# ESRD: Had elevated Cr, K on admit. Dialyzed with improved K.
Will continue increased frequency of HD for a few days. Due for
another HD session the day after d/c. His fistula has matured as
was used for effective HD. He will need to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 816**] as an outpatient to have his tunnelled HD cath removed. Pt.
did not want to stay in the hospital to have this removed. He
was restarted on his sensipar, renal caps, and fosrenal. He will
