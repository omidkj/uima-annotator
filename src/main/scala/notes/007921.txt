Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased seizure acitivty

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2192-7-19**] Left craniotomy for excision of mass


History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year old right handed female with a complex medical
history with a right temporal meningioma (treated with surgery
and proton beam irradiation in [**2178**]) and also a right parietal
glioblastoma multiforme. She also has a right thymoma and hx of
lung cancer.

She had a right temporal grade I meningioma resected by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**4-/2176**], proton beam irradiation to left parietal
parasaggital meningoma at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2176**], a left parietal resection
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**4-16**], cyberknife rdiosurgery right
parietal cavity [**5-16**], CT guided LUL lung bx [**3-17**] positive for
lung cancer, shoulder surgery for bone spur [**7-17**], portacath
[**11-17**].

She was hospitalized in [**2192-3-8**] after a seizure.  She then
presented to the emergency room on [**2192-5-8**] for right lower
extremity spasms. Her epileptologis, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 623**]
feels that the spasms are focal seizures from a small menigeoma.
The patient has stopped driving and feels that her seizures may
be originating for the lesion seen on the left parasagittal
region on her head. This is an area treated with probon beam
irradiation in [**2176**].

Currently she complains of increased seizure acitivty.  She also
has symptoms most likely unrelated to meningioma of shuffling
gait and numbness bottom of right foot.

MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST Study Date of [**2192-7-19**] 4:50 AM
1. The patient is status post right parietal craniotomy, with
persistent irregular area of enhancement in the right parietal
lobe and
vasogenic edema.
2.  Unchanged oval-shaped enhancing lesion in the left parietal
convexity,
likely consistent with a meningioma and unchanged area of
uniform enhancement in the left parietal region as described
above.

There is no evidence of hemorrhage. There is extensive edema
present similar in comparison to the comparison study performed
in [**2192-5-8**]. A noncontrast CT scan cannot say anything
meaningful about the extent of the resection. There is
intracranial air located in the left frontal region, which is
expected postoperatively. There is no evidence of any new
abnormalities.

Radiology Report MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2192-7-20**]
9:21 AM
1.  Post-surgical changes related to recent left parietal
meningioma resection.  Susceptibility artifact in the left
vertex, likely represents
pneumocephalus, better seen on CT exam one day prior.  There is
minimal
enhancement within the resection bed.  Attention on followup
exams is
recommended.  No intracranial infarction.
2.  Post-surgical changes related to remote right parietal
glioblastoma
resection.  An irregular focus of enhancement is unchanged.  The
surrounding vasogenic edema has mildly increased since prior
exams, which may represent progression of treatment changes or
underlying disease

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 69 year old female who presented electively on
[**2192-7-19**] for a left sided craniotomy for mass resection. Post
operatively the patient was electively extubated.  The post
operative Head Ct was consistent with expected post operative
changes.  The patient was recovered in the CSICU.

On [**7-20**], The patients exam was intact.  The patient was
mobilized out of bed to the chair.  A physical therapy consult
was ordered.  The patient was ordered for a regular diet and the
Foley catheter was discontinued. The patient's blood pressure
goal was liberalized to a goal of less than 160.  Given the
patient's complaints of mild abdominal pain and history for
eroded esophagus, the patients steroids were discontinued as
discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was transferred to the
floor.  The patient had a post operative MRI of the Brain which
was consistent with post-surgical changes with  minimal
enhancement within the resection bed.

On [**7-21**], the patient was able to ambulate independently and
tolerate her diet well.  She was evaluated by PT and deemed
stable to go home with in home PT services.  The patient was
discharged to go home on [**7-21**].  She is to resume taking her
aspirin in 5 days.
