Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53 year old
female with a past medical history significant for
splenectomy after a motor vehicle accident twenty years ago,
who had acute onset of headache approximately 36 hours prior
to presentation.  The headache was diffuse, severe and
throbbing associated with mild photophobia but no neck
rigidity.  The day prior she awoke and went to work, still
with the complaint of a headache, developed fever to 102.8,
despite Tylenol and finally presented to an outside hospital
once a rash developed.  Petechiae first noted on the face and
then spread to bilateral upper extremities and chest, none
below the waist.  The lesions on the face since coalesced to
a violaceous rash over the nose.  The patient was initially
tachycardia and hypertensive with systolic blood pressure in
the 70s, heart rate at 110.  She was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit where infectious disease, hematology and
cardiology were consulted.  Sepsis protocol was initiated and
she received five to six liters of intravenous fluids.
Concern for meningitis prompted a lumbar puncture followed by
empiric Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Chloramphenicol and
steroids.  Swan-Ganz catheter was placed for management of
volume status and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] on Levophed and Dopamine for further
management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post splenectomy twenty years ago.
2.  Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes a rash.  Sulfa causes a rash.
Intravenous dye causes a rash.

1.  Diovan 80 mg.
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg.
3.  A cox2 inhibitor p.r.n.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Levophed 4 mcg/kg.
2.  Dopamine 5 mcg/kg.
3.  Ceftriaxone 2 grams.
4.  Vancomycin 500 mg.
5.  Chloramphenicol one gram.
6.  Activated protein C 25 mcg/kg/hour.
7.  Protonix.
8.  Solu-Medrol 100 mg q8hours.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a registered nurse.
Previously worked at [**Hospital1 69**].
She denied tobacco use.  Occasional alcohol.  She lives with
her partner and two children.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease,
cerebrovascular accident, no cancer or diabetes mellitus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At admission, temperature was 100.0,
pulse 113, blood pressure 110/77, oxygen saturation 100% in
room air.  The patient appeared critically ill.  The heart
was tachycardic, S1, split S2, no murmurs.  The lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities
- no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Neurologic - No Kernig or
Brudzinski signs.  Dermatology revealed numerous petechiae in
the bilateral upper extremities and some on the chest.
Lesions on her face coalesced to form violaceous patches over
the nose and maxilla bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  From the outside hospital, white blood cell
count was 12.1, 32% bands, 67% neutrophils, hematocrit 33.1,
platelet count 77,000.  INR 1.5, partial thromboplastin time
70, fibrinogen low at 164.  D-dimer greater than 1.0.  Blood
urea nitrogen 34, creatinine 3.0.  Albumin 3.1, ALT 67, AST
58, amylase 47, AST 440, total bilirubin 135, lipase 106.
Cerebrospinal fluid was 186 red cells and [**Pager number **] white cells,
85% polys, glucose 68, protein 320.  Crypto antigen negative,
gram stain negative.

Data from [**Hospital1 69**], white blood
cell count 13.9 with 72% neutrophils, 24% bands, hematocrit
34.0, platelet count 81,000.  INR 1.6.  D-dimer greater than
10,000.  Fibrinogen 184.  Blood urea nitrogen 22, creatinine
1.0.  ALT 70, AST 311, alkaline phosphatase 45, LDH 545,
albumin 3.2, amylase 46, total bilirubin 2.0.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Infectious disease - The patient was initially admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where she was treated with
Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support and aggressive
fluid hydration was continued.  She was treated initially
with empiric therapy for meningitis with Vancomycin,
Ceftriaxone and briefly with Acyclovir as well.  The blood
cultures from the outside hospital eventually grew out
Streptococcal pneumoniae and it was therefore felt that the
patient had pneumococcal sepsis and meningitis.  The gram
stain and culture from the cerebrospinal fluid, however, did
not grow any organisms. The patient was also continued
briefly on the intravenous steroids but this was weaned off.
The patient was quickly able to be weaned off the pressor
support and improved nicely on antibiotic therapy.  She was
eventually transferred to the medical floor where she
continued to spike low grade fevers, prompting a further
fever workup which included further blood cultures and a CT
of the chest which revealed evidence of a resolving pneumonia
but no further sources.  The sensitivities came back
sensitive to Ceftriaxone and Penicillin.  As the patient was
allergic to Penicillin, the patient was continued on
Ceftriaxone to finish a twenty-one day course as directed.
At the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile for
greater than 24 hours and her white blood cell count had
returned to [**Location 213**].

2.  Hematologic - The patient was in DIC at the time of
admission.  She was treated with activated protein C started
at the outside hospital and continued at [**Hospital1 346**].  She had activated protein C for a
total of eighty hours and was stopped early as her platelet
count dropped to 39,000.  There was no evidence of bleeding
and subsequent to the discontinuation of the activated
protein C, the patient's platelet count rebounded nicely to
the high normal range.

3.  Gastrointestinal - Near the end of her hospital course,
the patient developed abdominal pain and nausea
postprandially.  An amylase and lipase were checked and
showed evidence of pancreatitis.  A CT scan was performed
although intravenous contrast could not be used because of an
allergy.  CT scan showed no evidence of a large abscess in
the pancreas or other pathology.  It was felt the
pancreatitis was due to sepsis and resulting inflammation.
The patient's enzymes titrated down nicely after one day of
NPO and intravenous fluids and her diet was advanced and
tolerated well.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged home with
services.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pneumococcal meningitis and sepsis.
2.  Pancreatitis.
3.  Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP:  Primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 7389**], as
well as Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 977**] of infectious disease.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q4-6hours p.r.n. pain.
2.  Ceftriaxone two grams intravenously q12hours times ten
days.

The patient was instructed to follow-up with her primary care
physician in regard to restarting her blood pressure
medications and hormone replacement.
