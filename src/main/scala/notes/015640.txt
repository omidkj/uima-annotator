History of Present Illness:
65yo gentleman with PMHx sig. of metastatic melenoma to the
brain s/p resection in [**5-3**] and brain XRT completed [**6-2**] who
presents with incidental massive bilateral PEs on routine
restaging outpatient CT scan. Pt reports that he has had mild
SOB in the past couple of days wtih assoc. pleuritic chest/back.
He thought this was due to known pleural mets on the right back.
He denied any fever, chills, cough, nausea, vomiting, abdominal

in right leg with foot drop since brain surgery. Has also been
having some sinus congestion for last couple of weeks, taking
benadryl sinus PRN.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.7 99 126/89 28. He was satting
83% on RA, now 99% on NRB. ABG on NRB was 7.48/28/208. Neurosurg
was consulted and agreed with heparin gtt with close monitoring
of neuro status. EKG showed a t wave inversion in V2, otherwise
unchanged, NSR at 96 bmp. Was given 1/2mg of diluadid IV for his
pain.

Past Medical History:
1. Melanoma on left posterior neck s/p resection 3 yrs ago, with
metastases to brain dx [**5-3**] s/p resection and whole brain
radiation and R axillary lymph nodes. Nodes have been noted to
imcraese in size.
2. Diverticulitis s/p partial bowel resection in [**2145**].
3. Left foot surgery to repair arch.

PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (Per onc note):
1. Melanoma removed from the left posterior neck in [**2156**], this
was a superficial spreading melanoma, 0.3 mm in depth, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**]
level II, lateral margins were involved by melanoma in situ,
ulceration was absent. Perineural invasion was absent, tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes were absent. There was less than 1
mitosis per mm2. This was stage T1a, Nx Mx melanoma. No adjuvant
therapy was recommended.
2. The patient presented on [**2159-5-6**] with weakness of right arm.
He was seen [**Hospital6 2561**] and head CT showed hemorrhage
in the left temple region in the area of a mass. The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
3. Left-sided high frontal craniotomy on [**2159-5-9**] with removal of
left frontal cystic melanoma, right-sided craniotomy on [**2159-5-14**]
with resection of right parietal melanoma. Pathology from these
lesions showed metastatic melanoma with tumor cells positive for
S-100, MART-1 and HMB-45.
4. Staging CT of the torso on [**2159-5-7**] showed a left lobe lung
mass measuring 2.9 x 2.1 cm, several enlarged right axillary
lymph nodes measuring up to 2.5 x 2.2 cm were found.

Social History:

Pertinent Results:
CT torso [**2159-7-16**]--PRELIM:
1. Urgent incidental finding: Massive bilateral PE, more on the
right.
2. Significant intreval increase in size of the metastatic
deposits at the R axilla.
3. Minimal increase in size of the LLL lung lesion.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo M with metastatic melanoma to the brain who presents with
massive bilateral PEs incidentally found on staging CT scan.

# Bilateral PEs:
Patient was hemodynamically stable and satting mid-90s on 4L NC.
 Given risk for head bleed in setting of brain metastases, he
was admitted to the ICU for observation with initiation of a
heparin gtt.  He was monitored overnight without event, and a CT
of his head was negative for bleed after being therapeutic on
heparin.

# Metastatic melanoma:
Pt is awaiting new MRI head results to determine eligibility for
chemotherapy.  Keppra was continued for seizure prophylaxis.
