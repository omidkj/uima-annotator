CXR [**6-10**] - FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-6**], there
has been substantial improvement in pulmonary vascular status as
well as decrease in the areas of opacification at the bases.
Some residual atelectasis, more prominence at the left. In the
appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening
pneumonia would have to be considered.  No definite pneumothorax
is appreciated at this time
.
RUE US [**6-3**] - IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus within the right
brachial, axillary and subclavian veins along the PICC line.
.
CT A/P [**5-17**] - IMPRESSION:
1. Small left-sided pneumothorax.
2. Free intraperitoneal air and moderate amount of high-density
ascites with extraluminal bowel contents noted in the left mid
abdomen at the anastomotic site consistent with leak
.
TTE [**5-17**] - IMPRESSION: Limited on-call fellow study. Moderate
global left ventricular systolic hypokinesis. Due to suboptimal
image quality a regional wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. No clinically significant aortic or mitral
regurgitation. Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
.
PATH [**5-17**] - Ileocolic anastomosis and omentum (A-J):
- Ileocolic anastomosis with transmural acute and chronic
inflammation consistent with perforated viscus.
- Omentum with acute inflammation.
.
CT A/P [**5-3**] - IMPRESSION:
1. Small-bowel obstruction, secondary to acute on chronic
Crohn's flare in the pelvis. There are multiple short segments
of narrowing with a longer segment of wall thickening and
mucosal
hyperenhancement, compatible acute disease and multifocal
underlying chronic strictures. Distally, again seen is long
segment fibrostenotic disease involving the distal and terminal
ileum,  unchanged from MR [**First Name (Titles) 9961**] [**2115-12-4**]. No
evidence of abscess or fistula formation. The key site of
obstruction is probably a long chronic stricture in the right
lower quadrant with severe polypoid mucosal enhancement
2. New compression deformity of T11 vertebral body, not present
on last imaging [**2115-9-17**], though with sclerosis
suggesting a degree of chronicity.
3. Small-to-moderate hiatus hernia, with oral contrast seen in
the distal esophagus. Interstitial abnormality at the right base
could thus reflect aspiration.
4. Bilateral parapelvic renal cysts, unchanged


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course by systems while in the ICU:
OPERATIVE:
- [**5-17**]: Anastamotic dehiscence and bleed, s/p takeback to OR.
Now with open abdomen, bowel in discontinuity.  Saw dusky large
and small bowel in OR,
- second look
- [**5-20**]: GT placement/IVC/closure
- [**5-23**]: bilat chest pigtail placement

CARDS:
- [**5-17**] Off neo, decreasing levo. Also went into SVT, adenosine
given with brief response. Started esmolol gtt with drop in BP.
Titrated esmolol gtt off.  Brief runs of Afib overnight as well
as decrease in plts and FSs (to teens).  Started amiodarone.
ECHO showed decrease in EF 70% to 35%, trending CEs (0.05,
0.04).
- [**5-18**]: plan for continued rescucitation with albumin TID, FFP
x3 and platelets x2, bp improved able to wean off levophed,
decreased UOP -> IVF increased, tachycardia -> increased
amiodarone, given 1unit PRBC, 1 unit of platelets
- [**5-20**]: Weaned milrinone to off, levo down. Repeat ECHO showed
decreased pulmonary pressures to 30, increased EF to 60s.

ID: - [**5-17**] Broadened abx to vanco and [**Last Name (un) 2830**] and pan-cx'd.

GI:
- [**5-17**]: Tbili 0.6 -> 6.8, Dbili 4.4.
- [**5-20**]:  Tbili and AST peaked

ENDO:
- [**5-17**]: Started D20 with D5LR and cont RISS for fluctuating FSs
(11-400)

F/E/N:
- [**5-20**] Started TPN.

RESP:
- [**5-21**]: AM CXR with unchanged bilat pleural effusions.

RHEUM:
- On [**2116-5-30**] a Rheumatology consultation was requested by the
family for Raynaud's treatment options in setting of relative
hypotension secondary to sepsis and several ischemic appearing
distal digits

HEME: Pt has a known hx of PE with distant use of
anti-coagulation. She was found to have non-occlusive b/l LE
DVTs on ultrasound. For this reason IVC Filter was placed in the
OR [**2116-5-23**]. In addition, Hematology consultation was requested
for management of anticoagulation given her persistent
thrombocytopenia with negative HIT panels.
- [**5-17**] LENIs showed likely chronic DVT in the R CFV - will
discuss anticoagulation vs IVC filter. INR rising, latest 2.2.
- [**5-20**]:  INR normal, plts still trending down 66->48

Overall ICU course:
[**5-21**]: lactate trending down,. [**5-21**]: Given albumin x2 for low UOP.
Weaned levophed off.  Amiodarone decreased to 0.5.  Started
trophic TF.  Decreased hydroc
