Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea/hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
86 y/o man with hypertension, PAF/flutter (on ASA and
Carvedilol, CHADSS 2) who p/w diarrhea.  Brought to the ED by
his daughter [**Name (NI) 25070**] because of multiple bowel movements the day
prior presentation with abdominal pain in the lower abdominal
region.  Daughter denies fevers.  Diarrhea was nonbloody per the
daughter.
[**Name (NI) **] recent travel and no raw food consumption. No nausea or
vomiting.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.7, HR 110, BP 89/55, and RR
31 satting 96% on RA.  Patient triggered for hypotension and was
bolused a total of 3200 cc's over several hours with increase in
his blood pressures to about 110 mmHg.  Labs showed a flat
lactate at 1.7, leukocytosis of 14.7 with 88 percent PMN's
without bandemia, and HCT of 50.1 (baseline low 40's).
Addiitonally, his creatinine was found to be 2.7 from baseline
of about 1.5-1.9.  He was found to be in atrial fibrillation on
EKG with evidence of a LBBB, and negative for Scarbosa's
criteria.  A troponin was checked which was 0.04 (baseline
around 0.03).  Given his abdominal pain, a CT scan of the
abdomen was done which showed a left sided inguinal hernia with
a portion of the sigmoid colon with fat stranding surrounding
it. Additionally, upstream of the loop of bowel within the
hernia, there was a featureless colon with hyperemia indicating
a possible component of obstruction, though the there is no
frank dilatation.
Also incidentally seen was cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
A chest xray was done which showed no acute processes.  Given
his CT abdomen findings, he was empirically given IV
ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.  Of note, as his ciprofloxacin
was being provided, he developed a rash at the insertion site.
Regarding his hernia, surgery evaluated the patient in the ED
and was able to manually reduce his hernia without complication.
 Upon transfer to the MICU, vitals were HR int he 110's, and SBP
in the 100's.  Patient afebrile and mentating well.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is alert and communciating with
no acute issues.  Stool is noted to be guiac positive.

IMAGING
- CXR [**5-20**]
SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The cardiac silhouette size
is mildly
enlarged but stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
unchanged. The
pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. Mild patchy
opacities at lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No definite
focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
present. There are no acute osseous
abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: Minimal atelectasis at the lung bases.

- CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**5-20**]
FINDINGS: Please note without IV contrast, the findings within
the abdomen
will be limited.

CT ABDOMEN: At the base of the lungs, bilateral patchy opacities
consistent with atelectasis. Apex of the heart is unremarkable.
Liver is unremarkable.  The gallbladder has small layering
gallstones. Bilateral kidneys are atrophic; however,
unremarkable. Spleen is also atrophic. The pancreas is
unremarkable. No mesenteric lymphadenopathy is appreciated.

CT OF THE PELVIS: Bilateral inguinal hernias are present with
bowel within
both of them. The right sided hernia contains bowel, however PO
contrast flows freely through it without any evidence of
obstruction. Within the left, there is fat stranding around the
portion of the sigmoid colon and mild thickening of the bowel
wall. At the entrance of the sigmoid colon into the hernia,
there is narrowing of the diameter and a transition of the
caliber of the colon.  While there is no frank dilatation, there
may be a component of impending obstruction with congestion of
the sigmoid mesentery. In addition, there is mild mesenteric
hyperemia and a featureless colon upstream of the colon prior to
the entrance into the hernia (601b:26) suggestive of an
inflammatory process.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No concerning sclerotic or lytic lesions are
seen. The
patient is status post lumbar fusion of L4-L5.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left sided inguinal hernia contains a portion of the sigmoid
colon with fat stranding in the sac and narrowing or bowel as it
enters and leaves. Beyond the hernia, the colon is mostly quite
collapsed. Upstream of the loop of bowel within the hernia,
there is a featureless sigmoid colon with hyperemia indicating
there may be some component of obstruction or inflammation,
although without dilatation. Whether this abnormality would
explain the patient's overall presentation is uncertain, but the
findings raise concern that the hernia may be clinically
significant; correlation with physical findings is recommended.
The possibility of mild colitis through the area could also be
considered clinically given the history of dirrhea.
2. Right sided bowel containing inguinal hernia appears
unremarkable and
incident without obstruction.
3. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.

- Echocardiogram [**2128-5-24**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal
and mid septum and inferior walls and apex. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 40%). Right ventricular
chamber size is mildly increased with hypokinesis of apical
segments. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. An
eccentric jet of moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen
directed towards the interatrial sept
