History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 58143**] is a 66 yo male with history of CAD s/p, CHF
(EF 15-20%), diabetes type II, PVD, COPD who presents with cough
and shortness of breath x 3 days.  Patient states that he is
able to ambulate around his house from room to room at baseline.
 On Saturday, he became dyspneic with exertion and noted
reduction in his exercise tolerance.  He states that he has been
short of breath with any movement for the past few days.  His
VNA called his PCP on Saturday who started him on levofloxacin.
He states that he has had a cough which is productive of
brown/green blood-tinged sputum.  He denies any fevers or
myalgias at home.  He endoreses chills and diarrhea since
Saturday.  He lives alone and denies any sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **]
states that he received both the flu vaccine and Pneumovax this
year.
.

Past Medical History:
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1) CAD: Recent anterior STEMI in [**12-3**] with stents x 2 to LAD,
course c/b cardiogenic shock requiring balloon pump.
- h/o BMS to proximal and distal LAD in [**2174**]
2) COPD:  On 2L NC at home.  PFT's [**10-3**]: Marked obstructive
ventilatory defect. The reduced FVC is likely due to gas
trapping but a coexisting restrictive defect cannot be excluded.
Suggest lung volume measurements if clinically indicated.  FVC
62% predicted, FEV1 39% predicted, FEV1/FVC 63% predicted.
3) Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, EF
15-20%
4) Hypercholesterolemia
5) Gout
6) Peripheral vascular disease s/p left iliac artery stent in
[**2174**].
7) Diabetes mellitus
8) Non-small-cell lung carcinoma, status post left pneumonectomy
9) Gastroesophageal reflux disease
10) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, chronically anticoagulated
on coumadin


Social History:
h/o prior tobacco abuse x 60 pack years; quit in [**2173**]. There is
no history of alcohol abuse.
.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.  Father had CAD in old age. Sister with MVP.

Physical Exam:
VS: afebrile, BP 91/59  HR 102  RR 22  O2 100% 4L  PULSUS 8
GEN: NAD, AOX3
HEENT: OP CLEAR, MM dry, JVP 15cm, no kussmauls
CARDIAC: RR, tachycardic, [**1-1**] HSM at LLSB

sided without rales

RADIOLOGIC DATA:
CXR [**2183-1-28**]: Stable examination demonstrating post left
pneumonectomy with no acute process in the right lung.
.
CT CHEST [**2183-1-28**]:
1.  Moderate pulmonary edema superimposed on severe
emphysematous changes in the right lung.  New right-sided
pleural effusion.
2.  Post left-sided pneumonectomy changes appear stable.
.
TTE [**2182-12-19**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. There is
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
anterior/anteroseptal, apical and inferior/basal inferolateral
akinesis (LVEF 15-20%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate right ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.
