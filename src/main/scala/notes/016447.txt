History of Present Illness:
67 yo woman with history of atypical meningioma in [**11-21**], s/p
resection and then XRT which was complete in [**2-22**]. Her family
says that prior to her tumor resection pt had significant
cognitive dysfunction and inattention, most of which resolved
after resection. For the past few months she has been improving
significantly with regards to her mental status. Was able to
take care of her own ADL's and had an improvement in her overall
affect. Then [**Name (NI) 1017**], sister says that patient had to suddenly go
to the bathroom, and she ran into the bathroom to urinate. When
she came out she just was not herself. She seemed more detached
and distant. No LOC. No seizure-like activity. Then Monday am
had
bowel incontinence, when asked about it she did not know that it
had happened. Since then she has been a little more fatigued,
less active. On Wednesday had worsening of her prior tremors in
her arms and mouth. She also became unable to feed herself b/c
seemed confused about the food.  She had one witnessed
mechanical fall, had difficulty getting herself up.  No LOC or
incontinence with the fall. She was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic
this am and there was concern about her deterioration in mental
status and therefore she was sent to ED for further workup.
.
ROS: no fever, cough, diarrhea, vomiting, recent illness, head
trauma. no focal weakness or sensory loss. no headache or visual
changes. has been taking her trileptal consistently.

Past Medical History:
thyroidectomy for cancer [**2183-8-29**];
uterine and transverse colon polypectomy for adenoma [**2183**];
basal cell carcinoma nasal bridge and left lower lip [**2188**];
GERD, hypothyroidism, hypertension.

Head CT:Postoperative changes seen in the left frontal lobe are
stable. Periventricular white matter hypodensity likely
represents chronic small vessel infarction. No evidence of new
hemorrhage.
---
Head MRI:IMPRESSION: No significant interval change since the
previous study of [**2193-4-8**]. Craniotomy is seen in the left
frontal region with encephalomalacia in the left frontal lobe.
Changes of small vessel disease are noted. No acute infarcts,
mass effect, or midline shift. No enhancing lesions.
---
EEG [**6-25**]:This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in wakefulness

due to the presence of continuous [**2-18**] Hz delta frequency slowing

intermixed with slow theta frequency slowing over the left
frontal
temporal region with intermixed sharp features. This finding
suggests a
subcortical dysfunction over the entire left frontal temporal
region and
anatomic correlation is recommended. There were no clear
epileptiform
discharges recorded.
.
EEG [**6-26**]:
IMPRESSION: This 24 hour EEG telemetry is consistent with a
moderate
encephalopathy. The previously seen left centroparietal
discharges are
considerably improved. Repeat EEG pending, preilm results:
further improvement.

Conclusions:
1. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function  is moderately depressed. Anterior, distal
septal, apical, and distal inferior  akinesis is present.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo woman with history of meningioma s/p resection in [**2192**] who
presented with new evidence of encephalopathy with inattention
as well as evidence of some frontal lobe dysfunction
(perseveration, inappropriate affect). Considerations for this
included toxic/metabolic, infection, tumor recurrence, or
seizure.
.
Upon admission, she had no metabolic or electrolyte imbalances.
An infectious work-up, including CXR, UA, CBC, and LP was all
normal.  The LP did have 2 WBCs, so we did consider HSV
encephalitis as a possibility. She had an HSV PCR sent from her
CSF (negative). She was emperically treated for multiple days on
acyclovir. A complication included severe nephrotoxicity (creat
6). At this point she was transferred to the unit for further
management. Following hydration, her renal function returned to
baseline (0.5-0.7).
.
A CT was unremarkable. An MRI was performed which showed no new
tumor, no new white matter disease, no evidence of bleeding, or
any other changes from her prior MRI.  She has no enhancing
lesions. No evidence of radiation induced necrosis.
  The patient had an EEG that showed slowing at the site of her
old tumor resection with some sharp features as well.  She was
initially continued on Trileptal 600-300 which was he
