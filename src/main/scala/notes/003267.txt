Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   The patient was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit from Catheterization Laboratory status
post myocardial infarction, status post intra-aortic balloon
pump placement.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 82 year old
female with no known prior history of coronary artery
disease, with a history of lung, breast and colon carcinoma,
who presented to [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital with a CK of
3,243.  The patient was in her usual state of health prior to
her presentation to that hospital until three days prior when
she developed dyspnea on exertion.  Her symptoms developed
into dyspnea at rest, and she was noted to have an O2
saturation of 83%.  The patient denied any chest pain at that
time.

At the outside hospital, her EKG showed ST elevations in V2
through V6, with Q waves present.  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] at which time she had a
heart rate of 87, a blood pressure of 128/80 and an O2
saturation of 97 on five liters.  She got aspirin,
nitro paste, Lopressor intravenously, intravenous Lasix, and
a heparin drip. She was then taken to the Catheterization
Laboratory on arrival at [**Hospital1 69**]
which showed a total occlusion of her proximal left anterior
descending, total occlusion of her left circumflex, 60%
proximal right coronary artery and a 30% obtuse marginal
coronary artery.  She had minimal right to left collaterals
and left to left collaterals.

Her right heart catheterization showed a wedge pressure of 27
and a PA-saturation of 49%.  Her ejection fraction was 15%
with anterior and inferior septal akinesis with an apical
thrombus present.  An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed
secondary to cardiogenic shock.  She was going to be
evaluated by Cardiothoracic Surgery for whether she is an
operable candidate.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Osteoporosis.
3.  Colon carcinoma status post partial colectomy in 11/98.
4.  Lung carcinoma.
5.  Status post left upper lobe lobectomy in [**2167**].
6.  Breast carcinoma.
7.  Peripheral vascular disease.
8.  Irritable bowel syndrome.
9.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
10. Spinal stenosis.
11. History of transient ischemic attack.
12. Depression.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Imipramine 25 q. day.
2.  Oxybutynin 5 q. day.
3.  Aricept 10 q. day.
4.  Zestril 20 q. day.
5.  Tylenol 650 three times a day.
6.  Lomotil 2 tablets q. day.
7.  Aspirin 325 q. day.

ALLERGIES:   Aricept causes nausea and the patient is
allergic to penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives with her husband in a
senior living complex.  She has a remote smoking history.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, vital signs are
temperature 98.9 F.; heart rate 85; blood pressure 127/68; O2
saturation 97%; respiratory rate 24.  In general, the patient
is mildly agitated, answering questions appropriately, in no
acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Tongue midline; moist mucous membranes.  Neck:  No
bruits.  Jugular venous distention above clavicle with
minimal head elevation.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm
with normal S1 and S2, positive S3.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Abdomen with positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Guaiac negative on presentation at outside
hospital.  Extremities with palpable dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally, trace lower extremity edema.  Left groin sheath
without hematoma.  Neurological:  Cranial nerves II through
XII intact.  Moving all extremities.

LABORATORY:  On arrival, white blood cell count 17.9;
hematocrit 41.9, platelets 226; 85% neutrophils, 11 lymphs, 3
monocytes.  PT 14.8, PTT 150 and INR 1.5.  Sodium 149,
potassium 4.5, chloride 113, bicarbonate 20, BUN 23,
creatinine 1.1 and glucose 146.

CK 3294, up from 3243 at the outside hospital.

Arterial blood gas was 7.48, 29 and 94.

EKG after catheterization showed ST elevation as well as Q
waves in V2 through V6, with Q's in II and AVL.

Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure with a left sided
effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  1) Ischemia - the patient who presented
with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction.  She had
cardiac catheterization with a total occluded proximal left
anterior descending, totally occlusion in the left circumflex
and 60% proximal right coronary artery.  The patient had
three-vessel disease.  Also noted on catheterization was
severe systolic dysfunction and elevated filling pressures
with cardiogenic shock.  She had an intra-aortic balloon pump
placed.

She was continued on heparin and aspirin.  The patient was
found not to be a surgical candidate.  She was eventually
started on an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker after her blood
pressure had stabilized when she was out of the Intensive
Care Unit and continued on aspirin.  The patient was also
sent home on Coumadin given her low ejection fraction.

2) Pump - the patient was found to be in cardiogenic shock
and had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed during cardiac
catheterization.  She developed some hypotension on the
following day and the patient was started on Dobutamine.  The
patient also was put on Nipride.

She had an echocardiogram that was done on [**2171-4-17**], which
showed [**Doctor First Name **] ejection fraction of 20 to 25% and severe left
global hypokinesis and severe pulmonary artery hypertension.
The patient was then weaned off the intra-aortic balloon pump
on the 2nd and pressors were eventually weaned off.  She was
started on ACE inhibitor and beta blocker.  Given her poor
ejection fraction, she was continued on heparin and started
on Coumadin.  She was discharged home on Coumadin.

The patient was also started on low-dose Lasix and eventually
sent home on 20 q. day.
