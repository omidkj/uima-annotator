Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old woman with history of CAD, presents with AMS and
sepsis, found to have MRSA urinary infection.
.
1) Urosepsis: Pt with fever, tachycardia, low BPs, and elevated
lactate on admission and code sepsis was called. Resusitated
with IVFs and placed on levophed x 1 day. Was subsequently
weaned off of levophed with stable BPs during remaining hospital
course.  Most likely source was UTI given positive UA and recent
urinary tract infection. Pt has had e.coli and klebsiella in the
past, both sensitive to fluoroquinolones. Pt received vanc/ctx
in ED. In MICU, vancomycin d/c'd and was continued on levaquin.
On transfer to floor, urine culture with MRSA, vancomycin
restarted and levaquin d/c'd. PICC placed for outpt IV
Vancomycin treatment for total of 14 days. Vancomycin trough
level while in hospital therapeutic at 11.0.
.
2) Cardiac: h/o CHF, CAD, HTN. Pt has tendence to get volume
overloaded and symptomatic CHF when her diuretic +/- her ACE are
held.  However, given low BP requiring pressors on admission,
ACE-I, BB, and Lasix were held. Once BPs were more stable, all
three were readded without event. ASA was also continued.
.
3) Acute Renal failure: Likely acute on chronic secondary to
prerenal state. Pt's Cr peaked to 2.0 while in house, has since
dropped back to baseline after IVFs.
.
4) DM - Diet controlled as outpt. HISS with QID FS.
.
5) Anemia - baseline Hct in upper 20s low 30s. Iron studies were
consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
.
6) s/p amputation of L 5th toe and R 3rd toe - Wound care
continued.
.
7) Access - PICC.
.
8) Communication - with pt's daughter [**Name (NI) 1154**] [**Name (NI) **]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 106214**].
.
9) Ppx - Heparin SQ.
.
The pt was discharged to a rehab facility for PT/OT and to
finish her 14 day course of IV Vancomycin for MRSA urinary
infection.
