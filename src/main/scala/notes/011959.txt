The patient was admitted on [**2146-3-10**], status post
left hemithyroidectomy for presumed adenoma. Please see
operative dictation. The patient was unable to be intubated
after multiple attempts by 2 senior anesthesiologists and
then finally failed fiberoptic intubation. For this reason,
the case was done via LMA. At the conclusion of the case,
there was some hypoxia and postoperative significant
atelectasis as the patient had been taking large volume tidal
volumes throughout the entire case. For this reason, his
saturations remained persistently low in the mid 80s on
support with oxygen and he was transmitted over to BiPAP. At
this point in time, it was decided the patient should be
recruited overnight and was sent to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12573**] ICU for which
he would have recruitment maneuvers, meaning BiPAP overnight
in order to try and resolve the atelectasis that was at the
base of the lung.

On admission to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12573**] ICU, they removed the BiPAP and
wrote him for subcutaneous heparin. So he was unable to be
recruited overnight. He ended up being persistently hypoxic
on nasal prongs, so he ended up staying another 2 days,
finally resolved the atelectasis and was discharged in stable
condition saturating approximately 94% in room air.

In conclusion, the reason for the dictation is such that care
needs to be taken with this patient in regards to the fact
that he is a very difficult airway and difficult intubation
so any further procedures on this patient will certainly
involve preoperative planning as far as the airway goes.
