Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Simvastatin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
progressive SOB and leg swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
68 y/o female with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 25% on
[**2-/2144**]), HTN, mitral valve prolapse, intermittent LBBB, atrial
fibrillation (in RVR 40% of time from device interrogation) and
h/o VF arrest s/p BiV ICD placement who presents with 1-2 days
of progressive SOB and leg swelling. The patient reports that
since Friday she has been having some worsening shortness of
breath, increased dyspnea on exertion. This labored breathing
has been intermittent since her last discharge from the hospital
in early [**Month (only) 359**]. She reports that her orthopnea has been stable
(1 pillow), and she has PND, but reports that it is stable
compared to her baseline. Denies any current chest pain, denies
any palpitations (reports that she has not had any palpitations
since getting her ICD placed). Had one episode of vomitus today;
reports that it was mucousy. Of note, she has noticed increased
LE edema/pedal edema for the last few days; she has never had
swelling like this in the past. The patient also reports general
fatigue. She checks her blood pressures at home and for the last
few days notes systolic pressures in the 70-80s, and reports
that since being discharged from the hospital in [**Month (only) 359**], she
has never had systolic pressures >100.
.
She reports eating out more instead of cooking at home, but
denies any increase usage of salt on her food. She has been
compliant with her medications. Of note, the patient reports
that she has not been feeling well since this past [**Month (only) 359**], with
intermittent episodes of labored breathing and shortness of
breath. She also reports that she has had baseline shortness of
breath for "years."
.
Of note, she was recently admitted from [**2144-8-11**] - [**2144-8-22**] for a
CHF exacerbation possibly worsened by AF with RVR. During that
hospitalization she received aggressive diuresis with Lasix. Fo
her atrial fibrillation she was initially transitioned from
Metoprolol to Carvedilol but was changed back to Metoprolol for
low blood pressures. She also underwent TEE with cardiovesion on
[**8-18**] but subsequently developed torsades following a dose of
Dofetilide in the settinf of a long QTc and later ventricular
fibrillation, for which she received defibrillation x one.
Following her arrest, Amiodarone drip was initiated with
transition to oral. A BiV ICD was placed successfully on [**8-20**]
with lead revision on [**8-21**]. She was discharged the following
day.
.
She had an office visit in device clinic on [**2144-8-27**], during
which she reported ongoing fatigue but improving DOE and no
palpitations. At that time she was still on Coumadin, which was
started during her recent hospitalization. At an appointment on
[**2144-9-4**], the patient was scheduled to undergo cardioversion for
atrial fibrillation. A TEE was recommended in the setting of
subtherapeutic INRs but the patient declined. She was
subsequently started on Dabigatran 150 mg [**Hospital1 **], but this was
subsequently stopped about three weeks ago [**12-25**] GI upset; the
patient also noted that her shortness of breath worsened on it.
She was then restarted on coumadin.
.
She also had an office visit on [**2144-9-21**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7965**] for
follow-up after her recent discharge. At that time, he decided
to decrease her Metoprolol XL from 150 mg to 100 mg daily. Her
Lisinopril was discontinued (although the patient reports that
she has been taking Lisinopril 20 mg daily) and her
Spironolactone temporarily held.
.
On arrival to the ED, initial vital signs were 123, 128/91, 26,
99%.
She received Lasix 80 mg IV once with improvement in her
respiratory symptoms. Prior to transfer her HR was noted to be
in the 110s.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient appears comfortable,
complaining of being hungry and thirsty. She is still
complaining of some shortness of breath, but denies any chest
pain, palpitations.

ECHO [**10-5**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 20%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Biventricular cavity dilation with severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin,
metabolic, etc. - cannot fully exclude multivessel CAD but less
likely). Severe mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Trivial pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-3-11**], the
severity of mitral regurgitation is increased and right
ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis are
now seen. The heart rate is now higher and the rhythm now
