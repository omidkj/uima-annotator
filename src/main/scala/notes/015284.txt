Chief Complaint:
short of breath for 1 week

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p attempted RIJ, R subclavian, Left subclavian central line.
Placement of Swan Ganz Catheter

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with h/o severe ventricular
dysfunction (EF 10%) secondary to polysubstance abuse and HIV
(dx [**2116**] on HAART, last CD4 359), 2+ MR, on methadone
maintenance who presents with 3 weeks of dyspnea on exertion,
worsening over the past week.  The patient notes that over the
past week activities such as brushing her teeth have become
difficult for her.  She has a non-productive cough which has
also been present for three weeks.  At baseline she is unable to
lie flat, however she says that this has worsened recently - her
breathing is much worse at night and worse with lying down.  She
endorses orthopnea, PND and ankle edema over past 2 days.  She
notes occasional sharp right sided chest pain which she believes
is due to "gas".  The pain occurs at any time of day, no
associated symptoms.  She denies any medication non-compliance
or dietary indiscretions.  She notes weight loss of 20lbs since
[**Month (only) 956**] and increased fatigue over the same time span.

The patient was admitted here in [**2135-8-6**] for CHF exacerbation.
 Per the d/c summary from that admission she was treated with a
single dose of IV lasix and sent home on PO dose.  Her BNP at
that time was 12,000.  Also of note, on last d/c summary from
[**8-/2135**], pt reported 30lb weight loss.  Patient has not been
placed on a beta blocker due to concern of cocaine use.

On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.  Other review of
symptoms negative aside from above.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

In the ED, the patient was afebrile with SBP as low as 80s.  An
attempt at placing an IJ and subclavian was attempted but
difficult due to reportedly abnormal anatomy.  SBP improved to
90s and no line was placed.  HR 70s, O2sat 100% on RA, afebrile.
 Lasix was recommended for CHF but not given due to low BP.  CXR
showed mild CHF.  The patient was given Levaquin for ? PNA on
CXR and nebulizers.

She was initially admitted to the cardiology floor, however,
given her Echo with severe [**4-8**]+ MR, cardiomyopathy and
congestive heart failure, she was transferred to the CCU for
swan ganz catheter and tailored therapy.


Past Medical History:
1. HIV- Diagnosed in [**2116**], has taken HAART therapy
intermittently. Stopped taking her pills three months ago
because stated she had foamy vomit every time she took them. CD4
274, VL<50 in [**12-10**]
2. CHF- EF 10-15% [**8-10**]. Reports no exacerbations of SOB since
admission in [**8-10**]. However one [**Hospital 1902**] clinic note states had
admission to [**Hospital1 2177**] in 05.
3. HCV- VL >700K in [**12-9**], not a good candidate for interferon
therapy or liver biopsy per gi note in 04.
4. mild COPD- PFTs [**7-/2129**] showed a normal study
5. IVDU--last abuse heroin several days ago, skin popping
6. Arthritis
7. chronic pancreatitis


Social History:
Has 20 grandchildren, tobacco: [**4-8**] cig/day, 40 py
Heavy EtOH in past. States that last used heroin in the past few
days (skin popping) and also used cocaine in the last month.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 72 year-old female with severe ventricular
dysfunction (EF 10%) secondary to polysubstance abuse and HIV
(last CD4 359) who presented with CHF exacerbation.
.
# Pump: The patient had an EF of 10% on her last echo prior to
admission (07/[**2135**]).  Troponin was elevated on admission, but
thought likely to be secondary to demand  after three sets were
stable.  Physical exam on admission was only slightly consistent
with CHF - crackles at right lung base, minimal LE edema.  CXR
was concerning for pericardial effusion given that cardiac
silhouette was enlarged from prior, and showed mild CHF, though
not worsened compared to a previous CXR.  Given her low EF, it
was likely acute on chronic heart failure with poor forward flow
secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy of HIV. The precipitating
event was unclear.  Echocardiogram [**2136-8-3**] showed no pericardial
effusion although severely depressed EF with MR.  BNP was [**Numeric Identifier 105347**].
 The patient was diuresed with lasix. A Swan Ganz catheter was
placed on [**2136-8-3**] in L brachial artery to monitor hemodynamics
and for tailored therapy.  Digoxin and ACEI were continued.
Captopril was titrated up as blood pressure tolerated for
afterload reduction.  Dobutamine was started to maximize heart
function/inotropic effect and titrated off on [**2136-8-6**].
Eventually, patient was weaned off oxygen and breathing
comfortably on room air.
.
# Rhythm: Pt was admitted in sinus rhythm and was noted to have
some ectopy on telemetry. On [**2136-8-4**] occasional ventricular
bigeminy was noted, and by [**8-5**] this pattern became more
frequent. Given her improved Cardiac index we attempted to wean
the dobutamine.  On [**2136-8-6**], patient developed runs of Vtach and
was started on Amiodarone 400mg PO BID.  TSH, LFT's, EKG were
within normal limits.  Digoxin dose was decreased to 0.0625mg PO
Daily due to Amiodarone metabolism. By discharge, the episodes
of Vtach had resolved.
.
# HIV: Last CD4 359 in 04/[**2136**].  Her outpatient regi
