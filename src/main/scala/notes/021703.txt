History of Present Illness:
48 yo male ESRD on PD, DM1, HTN, ?Cardiomyopathy with EF 40%,
presents to ED with dyspnea, chest tighthtess that started 3
days ago. He had noticed more difficult breathing when lying
flat, and feeling a chest tightness and neck tightness. He
reports having increased swelling in his BLE as well. He has
been having a consistent cough, with very little tan sputum
production. He denies fevers at home. He also reports elevated
BP more recently, which led to increasing his metoprolol by his
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had made some recent changes to his PD, and when he told
his PD nurse about his dyspnea and throat tightness, she
recommended he back off the dialysis. His symptoms did not
improve, and he continued to be symptomatic. Because of his
dyspnea, and chest tightness, he came to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

.
HR 101, 185/100. He was found to have crackles BL and a CXR-
diffuse infiltrates. He was given his home dose PO lasix, then
given lasix 40 mg IV x 1. He was also started on a nitro gtt
which helped with his dyspnea. He had some peaked T waves on his
ECG, and with K 6.1, he was given kayexelate, D50, and insulin.
Subsequently decreased to 5.5 prior to MICU transfer. He was
afebrile in the ED, but given the few patchy infiltrates on his
CXR, he was given levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1.
.
During his stay in the ICU, his crit remained stable and near
his baseline of 21 to 25. His troponin elevation was ultimately
thought to be largely [**1-19**] his renal failure. Renal was also
consulted and wants to restart him on epo, pending the results
of iron studies.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2193-6-25**]  1:14:42 PM
Sinus rhythm
Borderline left axis deviation - could be left anterior
fascicular block but is nondiagnostic  ST-T wave abnormalities
with prominent precordial lead/anterior T waves - are
nonspecific but clinical correlation is suggested for possible
in part ischemia or left ventricular hypertrophy
Since previous tracing of [**2193-6-24**], precordial lead T waves
appear slightly more prominent but may be no significant change.
.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2193-6-24**] 3:56
AM
Single AP chest radiograph compared to [**2193-6-23**] shows
decreased lung
volumes and worsening pulmonary edema. Two areas of more
confluent opacities
in the left upper and right lower lung zones may also be related
to edema,
however, a focal airspace process cannot be entirely excluded.
Recommend
followup after dialysis. The cardiomediastinal contour is within
normal
limits. There is no pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion





Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 48 yo male with ESRD on PD, Cardiomyopathy with EF 40%,
presents with hypoxemia secondary to volume overload and ? PNA
.
SUMMARY: Patient is a 48M with ESRD on PD, DM1, HTN,
cardiomyopathy (EF 40%) who presented to the ED with dyspnea,
SOB x 3 days. He was found to be in congestive failure, was
hyperkalemic with EKG changes (peaked Ts), and had a mildly
elevated troponin. He was also hypertensive to the 180s and
thought to be in hypertensive emergency b/c of the elevation in
troponin. His K+ was reduced with kayexolate, insulin, and D5W
and his BP was controlled. His CHF became more controlled with
lasix and he also received peritoneal dialysis. During his time
in the ICU, his crit remained stable and near his baseline of 21
to 25. His troponin elevation was ultimately thought to be
largely [**1-19**] his renal failure. Renal was also consulted and
wanted to restart him on epo, pending the results of iron
studies.  His O2 stat and volume status continued to improve and
he was discharged home.
.
#. Hypoxemia: Patient's hypoxemia was thought to be likely
secondary to volume overload from insufficient PD, though this
was not entirely clear. PNA was less likely given the absence of
leukocytosis and fever. He was ultimately put on room air and
oxygenated well after significant diuresis.  The patient was
also thought to have a cardiomyopathy but a [**2191**] ECHO shows
normal EF of 60% and no evidence of cardiomyopathy.
.
#. Chest Tightness: The patient had a slight upward trend in his
trop, but this was likely [**1-19**] poor ESRD and not demand ischemia,
as he had no evidence of ECG changes except mild T-wave
flattening in lateral leads on 1 ECG.  We treated him with ASA
and metoprolol prophylactically.
.
#. Hyperkalemia: Patient was hyperkalemic but this improved with
PD and furosemide.  He did not have signficant ECG changes.
.
#. Hypertension: Patient has history of hypertension and was
hypertensive on admission.  His BP improved significantly with
PD and titration of labetolol.
.
#. ESRD on PD: Peritoneal dialysis was continued during the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital stay.  Patient was discharged on a PD
protocol approved by the renal team.
.
#. DM1:  Patient was placed on an ISS and glucose was generally
well controlled during his stay.
