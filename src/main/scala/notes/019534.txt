began with migraine headaches in his occiput and fatigue.  He
then developed a dry cough with chest tightness, body aches,
malaise, headache, fatigue, a "scratchy throat," rhinorrhea,
fevers, chills and sweats.  These symptoms prompted a visit to

fevers. He denies diarrhea.  He reports that his children have
been ill and that his wife took them to the hospital to have

daughter out of the way before falling down, prompting his
father-in-law to bring him to the [**Name (NI) **].  He denies LOC.

He states that he has been consuming crackers, soup, and small
amounts of juice.  He last checked his fingerstick 6 days prior
to admission; it was ~120 at that time.  He states that he has
been taking his insulin as directed.  He admits to consuming a
12-pack of beer and a bottle of wine one week ago during the
Patriot's game.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2110-12-15**]: Heart size and mediastinal contours are normal.
Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
identified.  Normal pulmonary vascularity.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 36 yo male with DMI who presented to the ED
with DKA after a viral illness, he was initially admitted to the
MICU on an insulin drip and was able to be transitioned to
subcutaneous insulin and transferred to the floor the following
day.
.
1) Diabetic ketoacidosis:  The patient presented with an anion
gap of 25, glucosuria, and ketonuria. Considered were
dehydration vs. viral syndrome vs. drug/EtOH abuse vs. MI as
possible triggers for DKA.  As his EKG was negative for ischemic
changes and initial set of cardiac biomarkers were negative, and
especially in the context of pain with palpation of the anterior
chest wall-cardiac trigger of DKA was considered extremely
unlikely. CXR was negative as well blood cultures.  Urine/serum
tox screen were negative. His preceeding viral illness with
recent alcohol use as well as poor adherence were considered
factors in his DKA.  He received NS @ 500 cc/hour until serum
glucose <200 then D51/2NS @ 200 cc/hour with 20 meq KCl in each
liter of fluid to keep serum K+ in [**2-21**] range.  His insulin gtt
titrated to serum glucose 150-200 mg/dL until anion gap was
closed and was continued for 2 hours after a sliding scale was
started.  HbA1c (last documented was 9.9 in [**7-25**]) was 13.3.

He was evaluated by [**Hospital **] clinic and his insulin regimen was
increased.  He was discharged on 70/30 30 units before breakfast
and dinner as well as humalog sliding scale.  Outpatient follow
up at the [**Hospital **] clinic was arranged prior to discharge.  On
discharge FSBG was well controlled <200 on this regimen of
insulin.

2)Anemia - he had a borderline microcytic (MCV 79) during his
admission which is new.  Possibly due to combination of long
term poorly controlled diabetes as well as hemodilution due to
IV fluids during this hospitalization.  He was advised to follow
up and have repeat CBC by his PCP.

3) GERD - he was continued on PPI which he takes as an
outpatient

4) Code status: Full code.
