Allergies:
Zofran / Reglan / Compazine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/Extubation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 27 yo M with a h/o recurrent abdominal pain
thought secondary to enzyme negative chronic pancreatitis, who
is being transferred from an OSH after a respiratory arrest and
possible hypoxic brain injury.  He presented to the OSH on
[**2128-1-13**] with abdominal pain that was similar in nature to his
usual episodes of pain.  On the day of admission, he was treated
with 3-4 doses of 11am-6pm.  He received another dose at 11pm.
At 4am the patient was found to be unresponsive; vital signs
showed HR in the 150's and an oxygen saturation of 34% (per
report BP normal).  His oxygenation improved to 60% with NRB and
90% with ambu bag.  He was urgently intubated.  On exam he was
found to be decerebrating with pinpoint pupils.   He was treated
with narcan without great response.  A CT head at the time was
unremarkable.  Per report, an EKG at the time showed sinus
tachycardia without evidence of other dysrhythmias.  He was
transferred to the OSH ICU.  A repeat CT 18 hours later showed
anoxic encephalopathy.  Troponins returned positive and a
subsequent ECHO revealed biventricular systolic dysfunction, a
non-dilated LV with global hypokinesis (EF<30%).  An EEG in the
ICU was suggestive of a diffuse encephalopathy.

He was treated with Flagyl 500mg/Levofloxacin 750mg daily(day #1
[**2128-1-14**]) for PNA from likely aspiration event during his
respiratory event.  Per family request, the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Per family report the patient was feeling well since he was
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2127-11-29**].  His fiance reports he has not
taken any pain medication or anxiety medication since he was
discharged.


Past Medical History:
1. Pancreatitis - reportedly from a very young age. Unclear
inciting event. Sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**] of GI as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of
surgery.
2. s/p appendectomy and laproscopic cholecystectomy complicated
by severe episode of pancreatitis after intraoperative
cholangiogram here with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2127**].


Social History:
Denies tob/etoh/illicit drug use. He works for his father as
retail sale for oil company. Finished culinary college, would
like to work as a chef. Lives with his fiancee in [**Location (un) 16843**].


Family History:
Mother with DM

Physical Exam:
Admission
Vitals - 99.8 120/69 92 19 O2 100% (AC 500x14 FIO2 70%)
General - young male, lying in bed, intubated, not following
commands (per nursing, he did open his eyes to command)
HEENT - pupils 4mm bilaterally and reactive, no dolls eyes, no
gag
Neck - supple, no lymphadenopathy
CV - tachycardic, no murmurs appreciated
Lungs - decreased breath sounds at left base, coarse breath
sounds throughout left lung, good airmovement on right
Abdomen - soft, non-distended
Ext - 2+ DP/PT puleses bilaterally, 1+ edema bilaterally
Neuro - intubated, not following commands, toes upgoing
bilaterally, moving all 4 extemities (non-purposeful movements),
no dolls eyes

Pertinent Results:
OSH Imaging:
[**2128-1-13**] KUB - There are surgical clips overlying the right
upper abdomen consistent with previous cholecystectomy.  The
visulalized bony structures are unremarkable.  There are no
abnormal calcifications demonstrated.  The bowel gas pattern is
nonspecific with no evidence of obstruction or free air.
[**2128-1-14**] CT Head - consistent with anoxic encephalopathy
[**2128-1-15**] CXR - interval increase in infiltrate of left lung
[**2128-1-15**] CT Head - hypodensity noted within the bilateral globus
pallidus and caudate nucleus, more prominent on the left.  This
appears slightly more prominent when compared to prior study.
Findings maybe secondary to anoxic ischemic encephalopathy.

[**2128-1-16**] MRI Head - Findings are consistent with acute anoxic
brain injury involving the basal ganglia and deep white matter.
The appearances in the cerebellum are not typical for anoxic
injury and could be related to drug overdose. No hemorrhage is
identified. Although cerebellum appears slightly swollen no
herniation is identified.

[**2128-1-19**] MRA - Patent major intracranial arteries, common
carotid, cervical internal carotid arteries within the
limitations of the technique.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is 27 yo M with h/o pancreatitis transferred from
OSH after respiratory arrest, possible anoxic brain injury, and
depressed EF.
.
Respiratory Failure/Ventilator associated pneumonia - The
patient initial respiratory failure was most likely oversedation
by narcotics leading to respiratory failure and an aspiration
event.  He was intubated at the OSH and sputum there grew
haemophilius influenza.  He was treated with a 7 day course of
levofloxacin.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] at that time and he
began having increased secretions and his sputum grew MSSA.  He
was started on a 7 day course of nafcillin.  He was successfully
extubated on [**2128-1-20**].  Repeat sputum cultures then grew MRSA
and he was switched to vancomycin.  His last day of treatment
was [**2128-1-30**].
.
Anoxic Brain Injury - The patient was was unresponsive at the
OSH for an unknown period of time before being found to have O2
sat of 34%.  He was emergently intubated.  An original CT at
that time was normal (no evidence of bleed/herniation), but a
repeat Head CT 18 hours later showed diffuse anoxic brain
injury.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.  An MRI
here also showed diffuse anoxic brain injury specifically in the
basal ganglia.  He was eventually extubated on [**2128-1-20**].  His
mental status continues to improve with attentional deficits and
delirium worse at night.   He will be discharged to rehab.  He
was followed by Neurology should have outpatient followup with
them as well as a repeat MRI within 2-3 weeks.
.
Cardiac myopathy - likely [**2-28**] hypoperfusion during inciting
event; ECHO at OSH with global hypokinesis.  Repeat ECHOs here
were essentially normal, showing dramatic improvement.
.
Dysphagia - He was unable to safely swallow thin liquids. He was
able to tolerate nectar thick liquids. Also had hoarseness.
Considered vocal cord injury, so ENT consulted.  Evaluation
showed unilateral paresis of left true vocal cord.  He should
followup with ENT as an outpatient (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for monitoring
and continue thickened liquids for now.
.
Anxiety - Intermittent associated with tremor and sinus
tachycardia. Has been very debilitating to patient. Reports
never having these symptoms prior to admit. ?CNS component
related to encephalopathy.  Psychiatry followed him here.  He
was started on nightime and prn seroquel with some improvement.
Low dose Ativan was tried with improved symptom relief.  He will
be discharged on standing ativan and seroquel; this regimen can
be adjusted as needed at his rehab facility.
.
Sinus tachycardia: Rates up and down and at times up to 140's,
almost exclusively at night.  Multiple ECGs showing sinus tach.
Ruled out for VTE, hyperthyroidism. Volume repleted, no other
evidence of infection. Possible anxiety related and occurring
primarily during times in which he is feeling anxious. He was
started on empiric metoprolol,
