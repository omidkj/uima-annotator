History of Present Illness:
56M transfer from [**Hospital3 **] Hsp s/p R chest tube placement
for spontaneous pneumothorax. Pt arrives hemodynamically stable,
in no respiratory distress, with SaO2 97% on room air. Thoracic
surgery consulted for chest tube
management, evaluation, and work-up.

Pt reports acute dyspnea following an episode of violent
coughing this morning precipitated by inhalation of dry cold air
from a wall-unit air conditioner.  Episode described as initial
shortness of breath associated with sharp pleuritic chest pain
over the right flank, acute progressive dyspnea, sensation of
not being able to catch his breath.  [**Hospital **] transfer to [**Hospital1 **]
where pt was found to be tachypneic to 34 with SaO2 94%on 5L
nasal canula. CXR demonstrated 40-50% right pneumothorax and
chest tube was placed.

Denies previous episodes, trauma, recent travel, vigorous
exercise. Denies personal or family history of lung disease,
vascular malformations, stroke, dissection, connective tissue

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28508**] was admitted on [**2104-6-27**] following a right chest tube
placement for primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

Events: taken to the operating room on [**2104-7-4**] for Right VATs
blebectomy with plan for pleurodesis.  During induction he
experienced a pulseless electrical arrest. 1 amp of epinephrine
was given with ventricular tachyarrhythmia which spontaneously
broke.  Total time of hypotension was approximately 30 to 45
seconds. at the time h a
needle placed in the second interspace to compress  the
potential tension pneumothorax.  Subsequently to this we placed
a 12-mm incision on the midaxillary line and placed a 28-French
chest tube to drain any un drained collections.  He transfer to
the SICU.  He was seen by cardiology who felt the episode
of PMVT may have been due to transient ischemia from coronary
hypoperfusion and a catechol surge.  They recommended
beta-blockers.

Respiratory: Increased oxygen demands following pleurodesis of
right pleura.  Oxygen saturations were 85% w/ambulation, 2
Liters 91-92%.

Chest-tube: right with persistent air-leak.  The chest tube was
removed [**2104-7-3**] with recurrent pneumothorax.  A pigtail was
placed at the bedside with a persistent air leak.  On [**2104-7-6**]
talc pleurodesis was done at the bedside.  The chest tubes were
placed to suction for 48 hours then to water-seal with no air
leak. The chest-tubes were removed on [**2104-7-8**].

Chest films: serial Chest films revealed right pneumothorax
which resolved following pleurodesis.

Card: sinus tachycardia with burst to the 140's responded to
beta-blockers.  Blood pressure stable

GI: PPI and bowel regime.  Tolerated a regular diet.

Renal: renal function within normal range with good urine
output.  Left renal cyst was noted on CT. A renal US confirmed
left renal cyst.  Renal MRI showed Bilateral benign-appearing
Bosniak 1 and 2 cysts including a hemorrhagic/proteinaceous left
upper pole cyst without enhancement and no further imaging is
needed.

Pain: IV/PO Dilaudid with good pain control.

Disposition: he was discharged to home on [**2104-7-8**] with
supplemental oxygen and VNA. He will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
