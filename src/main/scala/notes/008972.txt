HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for upper gastrointestinal bleed.

Gastrointestinal.  Patient underwent endoscopy in the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  Patient found to have Grade 3
varices.  Patient had antibiotics prior to procedure, given
ASD.  Patient found to have varices of the distal [**12-30**] of the
esophagus, large clot in the body and fundus, normal antrum
and normal duodenum.  As noted, patient had 4 bands distally.
Patient given octreotide bolus and then continuous infusion.
Patient also begun on Inderal.  Prilosec was also initiated.
Patient underwent abdominal ultrasound which was negative for
portal vein thrombosis, no hepatomas seen.  For
encephalopathy, patient was begun on lactulose with mild
improvement.  Because of continued confusion, patient
underwent ultrasound guided paracentesis to rule out
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.  A small amount of fluid
was obtained.  Fluid contained 625 white blood cell, 29%
polys, 625 red blood cells.  Patient was begun on Ceftriaxone
for treatment of SVP.  Subsequent peritoneal cultures were
negative.  Patient received five days of Ceftriaxone.
Patient remained in the hospital for repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  On [**2151-1-12**], patient underwent
repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  Patient received pre and
post procedure antibiotics including Ampicillin and
gentamicin.  Patient had two varices which were banded.

During hospital course, patient became increasingly awake and
alert.  Patient had no asterixis, was able to walk around and
was eating and walking by herself at end of hospital stay.
Additionally, patient's hepatology serologies returned.
Patient found to be Hepatitis C positive.  Additionally,
Hepatitis B surface antigen negative, surface antibody
positive.  Hepatitis B core antibody also positive.  [**Doctor First Name **], AMA
also negative.

Patient was not requiring lactulose at end of hospitalization
and was maintaining quite well.  Because of SVP diagnosis,
patient was begun on maintenance Cipro for prophylaxis.  For
portal hypertension, patient was continued on Inderal 20 mg
b.i.d.

2.  Cardiovascular.  Patient had evidence of hypertension
after initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy procedure.  Patient
was begun on Inderal, captopril and briefly required a
Nipride drip.  On [**2151-1-5**], patient developed hypoxia and chest
x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.  Patient
was diuresed and also given nebulizer treatments with
improvement.  Patient was given Inderal 20 mg b.i.d.  Zestril
was increased to 40 mg q.d.  Additionally, Aldactone was
added 25 mg po b.i.d.  Patient underwent echocardiogram which
revealed mild dilatation of right and left atrium, small
left-right shunt across ASD, a secundum defect, mild mitral
regurgitation.  Ejection fraction greater than 55%, moderate
pulmonary hypertension, small pleural and pericardial
effusion.

3.  Heme.  Patient's hematocrit remained stable in the 30s.
Patient received three units of packed red cells on
admission.  At time of discharge, patient's hematocrit was
36.3.  Platelets remained low most likely secondary to portal
hypertension for her elevated INR and patient given Vitamin K
for several days.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hepatitis C cirrhosis.
