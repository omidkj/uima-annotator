Attending:[**Name (NI) 9308**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86608**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yoM with history of CAD, end stage CHF (LVEF
20%), atrial fibrillation, moderate atrial stenosis, CKD
(baseline Cr 1.4), who developed acute shortness of breath at
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] yesterday evening.  He was recently admitted from
[**Date range (1) 31153**]/10 for similar symptoms due to CHF exacerbation, and
had an admission earlier in [**Month (only) 116**] to the [**Hospital1 882**] for similar
symptoms complicated by hypotension requiring pressors.
.
When he developed his SOB last night, he was given a nebulizer
treatment which did not help and EMS was called.  The patient
thinks he was in bed when it happened but is not certain;  he
said he had been feeling well throughout the day.  O2 sat was
85% on RA per EMS, though there is no paperwork from EMS in
chart.  On arrival to the ED, he was found to have rales
throughout with CXR showing diffuse pulm edema with small b/l
effusions.  He was given lasix 80 mg IV and was started on BIPAP
10/5/100% O2, which improved his O2 sats to 90's with RR in the
20's.  ABG on current settings showed on the BIPAP showed
7.45/35/506.  He was also started on nitro drip for HTN/CHF (not
for chest pain, which patient denies).  Received 325 mg ASA.
Trop 0.03.  In the ED prior to transfer, VS were 97.9, 1222
AFib, 107/75, RR 28, 100% O2 sat on BIPAP PS 10/5 PEEP with 100%
O2.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2175-6-17**]**

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2175-6-17**]):
      REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], R.N. ON [**2175-6-17**] AT 0530.

      CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
         FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
         A positive result in a recently treated patient is of
uncertain
         significance unless the patient is currently
symptomatic
         (relapse).

.
[**2175-6-16**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Interval decrease, but residual mild pulmonary edema.
2. Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
3. No evidence of pneumonia.
.
[**2175-6-16**] Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25%). [Intrinsic function
may be more depressed given the severity of mitral
regurgitation.] The left ventricular apex is heavily
trabeculated, but no masses or thrombi are seen. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.8cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets and supporting
structures are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with severe
global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (multivessel CAD, toxin,
metabolic, etc.). Increased PCWP. Mild aortic stenosis. Moderate
mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2175-6-3**], the
severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated PA systolic
pressure are now reduced. Right ventricular free wall motion is
improved. The other findings are similar.
.
[**2175-6-15**] TEE:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not
quantified). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets do not
fully coapt. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No left atrial/appendage thrombus seen.
Moderate-severe mitral regurgitation. Aortic stenosis present
(not quantified). Severely depressed left ventricular function.

.
[**2175-6-14**] CXR:
Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral
pleural effusions, slightly worsened since [**2175-6-3**].
