Change in mental status, epistaxis and falls

Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
45 year-old male with EtOH/Hep C cirrhosis, portal hypertension,
hepatic encephalopathy admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] [**2122-10-26**] with mental
status changes and epistaxis.  Patient noted to have increased
falls, hallucinations and confusion at home prior to admission
as well as some diarrhea and hematuria preceeding his admission.
 On admission he was lethargic and icteric, with BP 122/80, HR
59, satting 100%RA, oriented x 2.  He had a paracentesis which
ruled out SBP.  Over the next several days, his INR continued to
climb (from 2.7 on admission to 4.0 on transfer).  His
creatinine also climbed (up to 5.5 on transfer from 0.8 @
baseline) with decreased urine output.  He received IVF and
bicarbonate as well as albumin without improvement.  He was
noted to have R hydronephrosis, however his ARF was attributed
to hepatorenal syndrome and not to obstructive hydronephrosis.

He was also noted to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status that
was attributed to hepatic encephalopathy.  On [**2122-10-29**] he
received 2 U PRBC's for hct 19, but his hct has largely been
stable ~ mid 20's.

The day prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], pt was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 2177**] ICU for decreased mental status.  At that time he was noted
to have asterixis and increased lethargy.  He had had no melena
or hematemesis over the course of his hospitalization.  His
vitals today prior to transfer were T 99.8 106/64 65 96%RA. He
had been hemodynamically stable througout his hospitalization.
His I/O over the time in the ICU was 600cc in/500cc out (all
urine).

Currently, patient is unable to answer questions regarding his
condition.  Patient was transferred initially to the floor but
represented to the MICU with persistent and heavy penile
bleeding after possible traumatic insertion of a foley catheter.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, the patient's mental status change was felt
secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Possible etiologies
included SBP, ARF, non-ascitic infection, epistaxis and
increased NH3 load from blood. Ascites evaluation was initially
negative for infection. CT head was within normal limits. His
renal failure was felt secondary to hepatorenal syndrome +/- ATN
secondary to intravascular volume depletion/prerenal failure
which was addressed.

The patient was evaluated by the transplant service early in his
hospital course, and initially considered a candidate for
liver/kidney transplant. Over the course of his hospitalisation,
he developed worsening renal failure requiring institution of
dialysis and CVVHD. His liver function also progressively
deteriorated, with evidence of worsening coagulopathy and
decreased hepatic reserve and synthetic function. His course was
further complicated by MSSA bacteremia/MRSA in sputum treated
with broad-spectrum antibiotics, respiratory failure requiring
intubation, then spontaneous bacterial peritonitis requiring
continued antibiotherapy. His hepatic function further
deteriorated with evidence of worsening coagulopathy and
hypoglycemia requiring continuous glucose infusion. On [**12-8**],
Mr. [**Known lastname 31498**] developed melena. An EGD revealed non-bleeding
esophageal varices and no ulcers, but evidence of oozing from
the gastric mucosa. He was medically managed and required
continued aggressive transfusional support for his anemia,
thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. He also had recurrent
hypotensive episodes.

Given the above events and ominous prognostic signs, a consensus
recommendation, involving the hepatology service, transplant
surgery service and primary team, was made to withdraw the
patient from the transplant list on [**12-9**]. A family meeting was
held on [**12-10**] to review the hospital events and most recent
recommendation. The patient's ominous prognosis was also
reviewed. The decision was made by the family to withdraw care
and comforts measures were instituted. Mr. [**Known lastname 31498**] was
extubated. He expired on [**12-10**] at 20:58.
