Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Anemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with transfusion-dependent anemia attributed to
autoimmune hemolysis & chronic GI bleeding on coumadin for a
mechanical aortic valve admitted with Hct drop and shortness of
breath.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 66590**] has been hospitalized frequently at [**Hospital1 18**], most
recently in late [**2160-4-1**] with recurrent anemia attributed to
GIB without hemolysis (negative Coombs test and normal LDH.) Of
note those previous hospitalizations have identified component
of autimmune hemolysis. Typically, he is transfused at [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab q2weeks.  On a routine check today, his Hct was 16.4 down
from 27.4 on [**5-14**]. He complained of shortness of breath at
rest and mild chest pressure.
.
Initial evaluation in the ED was notable for VS: 97.4, 80,
98/50, 18, 100%ra. Hct 17.9, LDH 199, BUN/Cr 48/1.5, bili 0.2,
INR 3.3, hapto pending. His BP was transiently 84/47 for which
he was given 1L NS with increase in his SBPs to the 90s and
improvement in his sxs. He was not given blood b/c his extensive
cross-matching requirements have not yet been completed. EKG
notable for an old RBBB. No imaging obtained. Guiaic positive
brown stool.
.
Of note, the patient has had extensive workup in the past for GI
bleed(EGD x4, [**Last Name (un) **] x2, capsule x3, CT abd/pelvis, bleeding scan)
without clear source or site, and felt to be most likely
bleeding from an UGI source that is not possible to reach
endoscopically. On prior admissions, further invasive testing
was discussed, and the patient and HCP opted for more
conservative measures including transfusions and iron
supplementation.
.
On the floor, the patient denies any recent BRBPR, melena or
hematemesis. He denies any dizziness or confusion either at the
moment or over the last few days. He denies any chest pain but
does have some shortness of breath over his baseline.

effusion remains unchanged.

the prior
study and ends in the upper SVC/central right brachiocephalic
vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]M with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, mechanical aortic valve on
coumadin and recurrent GIB and admissions for anemia presenting
from rehab with anemia.
.
#. Anemia: Most likely related to recurrent ongoing GIB given
recent hx of the same; of note, he had not had any large bowel
movements to explain this bleed on admission to the ICU.
Etiology of current bleed likely coagulopathy with INR 3.3,
above goal range 2 to 2.5.  He has had work up in past including
colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy without finding source of
bleed. Patient asymptomatic and HD stable throughout his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
stay. Other possible etiologies of his HCT drop are recurrent
autoimmune or mechanical hemolysis, but this seems unlikely with
LDH and bilirubin nl range. Of note, the patient is
appropriately compensating for anemia, with Retic 6.9. This is
likely the etiology of his elevated MCV and RDW.
.
Coumadin was held, a small dose of Vitamin K was given, and the
patient was transfused with 3 units of RBCs. His hct was trended
over 24 hours and remained stable 27-28.
.
He was discharged on 2mg of coumadin.

# Dyspnea: Patient presented with dyspnea that was likely
secondary to anemia. There was no concern for ACS given nl EKG
and No concern for PNA clinically or on CXR.
.
# Coagulopathy: INR 3.3 with goal 2-2.5. This is likely due to
coumadin dosing. Per discussion above, was given Vitamin K 0.5
mg PO x1 on admission.
.
# Mechanical Aortic valve: The patient has a goal INR of [**3-5**].5.
Coumadin was held on admission due to supratherapeutic INR; he
was discharged with INR 2.1 and 2mg coumdin daily. Please check
INR daily for the next week to ensure he remains therapeutic.
.
# Acute on CKD: Cr currently at baseline (1.2-1.5)
.
# GERD: Patient was on PPI drip here but discharged on home
omeprazole dose of 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
#. CAD/Hyperlipidemia/HTN: Continued statin. Held carvedilol in

setting of GIB and stable blood pressures during admission but
resumed home dose of medications prior to discharge.
