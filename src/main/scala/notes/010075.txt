Pertinent Results:
[**2195-1-19**] Echo: PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. 2. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 3. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. 4.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. 5. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 6. The aortic valve
is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the
anterior mitral leaflet. 7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 8. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results. POST-CPB: On infusion of
phenylephrine briefly. AV pacing, then a pacing. Well-seated
bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. Trivial central AI,
gradient now 11 peak, 6 mean. Preserved biventricular systolic
function with LVEF now 40 %. Aortic diameter now measures 3.8 in
the ascending aorta. Contour of the aorta is preserved post
decannulation. I certify that I was present for this procedure
in compliance with HCFA regulations.
