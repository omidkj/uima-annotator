Pertinent Results:
[**2143-11-12**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA with stenosis <40%. Left ICA
with stenosis <40% .
[**2143-11-13**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis in the anteroseptal
distribution on top of global hypokinesis.. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 30
%). There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The eccentric mitral regurgitation vena contracta is
>=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results on [**Known lastname 49937**], A at 10AM before surgical incision. The
thoracic aorta is tortuous and pacing wires are seen in the
right atrium and ventricle. POST-BYPASS: Patient is on milrinone
0.2 mcg/kg/min. Mild RV global hypokinesis. Mild TR. The
bioprosthesis in the mitral position is well placed, and
functioning well with no residual MR and mean gradient of 2mm of
Hg. Thoracic aorta is intact. Anteroseptal hypokinesis persists
on top of global hypokinesis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 49937**] was admitted one day prior to surgery for
pre-operative work-up and Heparin bridge do to history of Atrial
Fibrillation with Coumadin. On [**11-13**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x
2 (Left internal mammary artery to left anterior, saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal), Mitral Valve Replacement (33mm St.
[**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic Porcine). Cardiopulmonary Bypass time= 128 minutes.
Cross Clamp Time= 104 minutes. Please see Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] operative
report for surgical details. He was intubated, sedated, and on
pressors and inotropes to optimize hemodynamics. He was
transferred to the CVICU in critical but stable condition. POD#1
he awoke neurologically intact and was weaned to extubation. All
drips were weaned off. Electrophysiology interrogated the
Permanent Pacemaker. All lines and drains were discontinued in a
timely fashion. Beta-blocker, statin, aspirin, and diuresis was
initiated. He continued to progress and on POD# 4 was
transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical therapy was consulted for evaluation and assessment.
Anticoagulation with Coumadin was resumed. The remainder of
Mr.[**Known lastname 49937**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] course was essentially uneventful. He
was cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] for discharge to rehab on POD# 5. All
follow up appointments were advised.
