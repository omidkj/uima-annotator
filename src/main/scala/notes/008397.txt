Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast in the
body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Lipomatous hypertrophy
of the interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta. Normal aortic
arch diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
Mildly dilated descending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
patient.
Conclusions
PRE GRAFTING The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricle displays normal free wall
contractility. On epiaortic scanning (images not saved) there
are complex (>4mm) atheroma seen in the ascending aorta. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in
the operating room at the time of the study.

POST GRAFTING There is normal biventricular systolic function.
Valvular function is unchanged. The thoracic aorta remains
intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2158-9-27**] Mr. [**Known lastname 45079**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a coronary artery bypass
grafting times four (left internal mammary to left anterior
descending, saphenous vein graft to diagonal, saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to right coronary
artery) performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He tolerated this
procedure well and was transferred in critical but stable
condition to the surgical intensive care unit.  He was weaned
from pressors and extubated by the following day.  He was
transferred to the step down floor.  His chest tubes were
removed.  Plavix was restarted.  He was seen in consultation by
physical therapy and it was felt that he would benefit from
rehab at the time of discharge.  He failed a voiding trial so
his foley was replaced and his terazosin was restarted for known
benign prostatic hypertrophy.  He had a short episode of
confusion which resolved with sleep and the cessation of
narcotics.  His epicardial wires were removed.  By
post-operative day four he was deemed ready for transfer to
[**Hospital6 **].  All follow-up appointments were advised.
