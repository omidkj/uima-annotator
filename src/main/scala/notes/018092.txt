Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for bilateral pulmonary embolism

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
67 y/o F with PMHx of Esophageal Dysmotility and Raynauds who
presented to an OSH with fatigue x 3wks found to have NSTEMI and
hypoxia. At the OSH CE were positive (CPK 95 CK mb 10.3 trop I
0.68 ). She was loaded with plavix, given ASA, ativan,
lopressor, nitro paste and started on a heparin GTT (7500 bolus,
1450 u/hr). The ECG at the OSH showed sinus tachycardia. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further care.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T 98.7 P 103 BP 130/75 RR 24
O2 sat 89 RA. She underwent a CTA to eval for PE, given hypoxia
and tachycardia which revealed bilateral large PE's. The ECG
here showed sinus tach with non-specific TWF. She received 1L NS
and the heparin GTT was continued.
3 weeks ago the pt. received cortisone injections for back pain.
Since that time she has not felt well. She has experienced
flushing and "elevated BP. Last tuesday she had CP and took SL
NTG and ASA with good result. She went to [**Hospital **] hospital,
where ECG and CE were nromal per pt. She was sent home but still
had CP and DOE while climbing stairs. She also reports
palpitations. She again had chest pain this last Saturday and
presented to [**Hospital1 18**]. CE were normal and the ECG was normal. She
underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol on Sunday which did not show any
ischemic changes. Her symptoms were thought to be due to GI
issues. She underwent an endoscopy on [**2184-3-10**]. Per the pt. her 02
sat after the procedure was 89% on RA. That night, she had a
pre-syncopal event at home and felt "she was dying." EMS was
called and she presented to [**Hospital **] hospital as above.

current vitals in ED 113/52, 98, 94% 3.5L, rr 20

Review of sytems:
She reports right calf pain since Sunday. She has felt unwell
for the past 3 weeks. + URI symptoms- productive cough. poor
appetite for 3 weeks. 17lbs weight loss over 3 weeks. CP, palps,
DOE, SOB, fatigue as in HPI. denies F/C/NS. no diarrhea, abd
pain, N/v, hemetemasis, BRBPR.

Images:
CTA [**2184-3-11**] Prelim- large bilateral PE's, small hiatal hernia,
thyroid nodule. recommend ultrasound on non-emergent basis
stable left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
ETT [**2184-3-7**] INTERPRETATION: This 67 yo woman with uncontrolled
HTN was referred for evaluation of chest pain. The patient
performed 7 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol ~3.8 METs and stopped
for an exaggerated BP response and fatigue. This represents a
limited exercise tolerance. The patient presented with 3/10 left
upper chest "pressure", however before exercise, she denied this
symptom. No other symptoms were reported throughout the
procedure. In the presence of baseline non-specific ST-T waves,
there were no significant changes at peak exercise. Rhythm was
sinus without ectopy. Heart rate response to exercise was
appropriate.
IMPRESSION: Limited exercise tolerance. Exaggerated resting and
exercise BP. Non-anginal symptom with no significant EKG changes
from baseline.
.
EKG: rate 108 NSR, normal axis, q waves in III, aVF (new since
[**2184-3-7**]), low voltage in pre-cordial leads

INDICATION: 67-year-old female with shortness of breath since
endoscopy
yesterday with troponin bump at outside hospital. Evaluate for
pulmonary
embolus.

COMPARISON: [**2176-5-9**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast and contrast-enhanced MDCT acquired
axial images of
the chest from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen.
Multiplanar
reformatted images were obtained.

FINDINGS: Large filling defects in the bilateral main pulmonary
arteries
extending into the segmental branches are compatible with
pulmonary embolus.
The thoracic aorta maintains a normal caliber and contour. The
main
pulnoary artery diameter equals that of the aorta, indicating
dialation. The
heart size is normal. There is dilatation of the right ventricle
compared to
the left with RV/LV ratio of 54:38 = 1.4 (normal 0.9) indicating
right
ventricular strain.

There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. The lungs show
diffuse
hypoventilatory change . 12 mm pulmonary nodule in the left lung
base which is
unchanged since the [**2176-5-9**]. The airways are patent to the
subsegmental
level however there is collapse of the airway on these apparent
expiratory
images suggestive of tracheobronchomalacia. There is no
mediastinal or
axillary lymphadenopathy. The visualized upper abdomen is
notable for a 2- cm
cyst in the interpolar region of the right kidney. Hypodense
nodules are
identified in each lobe of the thyroid for which further
evaluation with
ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent basis. A small
hiatal hernia is
present. The bones show no lesions worrisome for osseous
metastases.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large bilateral PEs with evidence of right ventricular
strain.

2. Stable left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.

3. Bilateral hypodense nodule in the thyroid gland for which
further
evaluation with ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent
basis.

4. Small hiatal hernia.

5. Collapse of the airways on apparent expiratory images is
suggestive of
underlying tracheobronchoalmalacia.

STUDY: Bilateral lower extremity veins ultrasound.

INDICATION: Bilateral pulmonary embolism and lower extremity
pain.

FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and pulse Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was
performed on
bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal
veins. Normal
flow, compression, augmentation and waveforms are demonstrated.
No
intraluminal thrombus detected.

IMPRESSION: No lower extremity DVT identified.

Provisional Findings Impression: [**Name (NI) 25790**] FRI [**2184-3-12**] 9:35 AM
Slightly limited examination of the lower common iliac seen
secondary to
patient body habitus. No definite evidence of intraluminal
thrombus within
the visualized venous system of the abdomen and pelvis.

2.3 cm right renal lesion, not completely characterized.
Followup
characterization by ultrasound or MRI is advised.
