Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 174**] is a 63 year-old female with a history of CAD s/p CABG
(LIMA-LAD, SVG-Diag, SVG-RPL) and PCI with stent to LAD and LCX
[**2152**], systolic CHF (EF 25-30%), s/p ICD, post-operative PEs on
coumadin who had 6-8 weeks of worsening SOB with minimal
exertion and associated chest discomfort, [**1-12**] pillow orthopnea,
and PND.  SOB was not improved with home O2.  She was directly
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] yesterday for heparin bridge for known PEs
prior to elective, repeat cardiac catheterization. However, on
admission, she described worsened SOB this AM with acute onset
of new [**5-19**] substernal chest pressure radiating to her left
neck/shoulder on arrival to the floor which was different than
her recent chest pain symptoms. Her pain was unresponsive to SL
NTG, and her paced EKG showed ST changes concerning for acute
ischemia (ST depressions in II, III, AVF and STE in AVL), so she
was given aspirin, loaded with plavix, started on a nitro gtt,
and transferred to the cath lab for urgent catheterization.
Cardiac enzymes at that time were negative.
.
In the cath lab her coronaries were found to be stable. LVEDP
was 43 so she was given lasix 40mg with 500 cc UOP.  PA gram to
look for PE was unrevealing.  Pt was transfered to the CCU
post-catheterization with stable vital signs.  She reported
improvement in her shortness of breath.  She continued to
complain of abdominal pain radiating to the chest, but her nitro
gtt was titrated off as her pain was non-cardiac.  She remained
stable overnight and was called out to the floor.
.
On the floor, the patient continues to complain of severe
abdominal pain which she describes as excruciating "torquing"
left upper quadrant pain radiating from under her left rib to
her chest and across her precordium.  She had difficulty
describing the quality, onset, and pattern of pain.  However,
she did report that she first experienced the pain in [**Month (only) 1096**]
as a "ripping" "tearing" pain at the site of her previous hernia
repair.  From her outside hospital records, she had presented to
Lakes [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital in the past for workup of her abdominal
pain.  She underwent a CT abdomen which, per records, showed a
small recurrance of her ventral hernia but no incarceration or
strangulation.  The surgeon decided not to re-operate on the
hernia.  The patient reports the pain is intermittently present
to fluctuating degrees of severity, but she reports she is never
pain-free.  Her pain is reportedly the worst it has been, and
the patient repeatedly is demanding Demerol for pain, which she
reports is the only medication which effectively relieves her
pain.  She also presented with a typed note, allegedly from the
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 71539**] that Demerol is the only medication she may take
for pain.  The PCP was called, and reported he did not write the
note and that this would invalidate the patient's narcotic
contract.  Of note, she has had a history of narcotic abuse in
the past.
.
She denied any prior history of stroke, TIA, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denied recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denied exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Cardiac Catheterization ([**2157-2-15**]):
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three
vessel CAD. The LMCA was patent with a 40% stenosis. The LAD was
a small
vessel with diffuse disease up to 40%. The LCx was occluded
proximally.
The RCA was diffusely diseased but patent with a 30% stenosis in
the mid
vessel.
2. Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA to be small
but widely
patent. The SVG-Diag which also supplied OM1 was patent as was
the
SVG-PDA.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right and
left sided
filling pressures with an RVEDP of 23 mmHg and an LVEDP of 43
mmHg.
There was severe pulmonary arterial systolic pressure with a
PASP of 67
mMHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 2.2 L/min/m2. There was

moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with an SBP of
144
mmHg.
4. There was no pressure gradient between the left ventricle and

ascending aorta on left heart pullback.
5. Left sided pulmonary angiography performed due to decreased
breath
sounds in the left lung fields did not demonstrate any discrete
filling defects to suggest a large pulmonary embolus.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel CAD.
2. Severe left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Severe pulmonary hypertension

TTE ([**2157-2-16**]):
The left atrial volume is severely increased. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta i
