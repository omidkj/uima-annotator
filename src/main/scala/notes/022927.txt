Penicillins / Shellfish Derived

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 86 year old female with a past medical history of
occipital stroke with memory difficulties, atrial fibrillation
with recent significant health decline who presents from home
with cough for one week. Ms. [**Known lastname 2429**] was admitted to this hospital
from [**2200-6-23**] to [**2200-7-2**] with altered mental status. She was
diagnosed with multiple subacute cerebrovascular infarcts likely
secondary to cardioembolic phenomenon. She was noted to have low
blood pressures during that hospitaliztion ranging from the 90s
to 110s systolic. She also was noted to have a persistent oxygen
requirement of 2 liters initially attributed to cardiogenic
pulmonary edema although hypoxia persisted despite diuresis. She
was discharged to skilled nursing facility on [**2200-7-2**] but her
rehabilitation was complicated by two hospital admissions for
pneumonia and congetive heart failure (not at this facility).
She was ultimately discharged home two weeks ago. Since being
home she has been noted to be weaker than her recent baseline.
She has been ambulating in her house without a walker and in
general performing all of her activities of daily living. She
continues to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, particularly
when she is not feeling well. Per her niece over the past week
she has been experiencing cough productive of minimal sputum,
sore throat, clear rinorrhea. Her niece has also experienced
similar symptoms. She has not been experiencing frank fevers or
chills. She has been weaker than baseline. She has not had
lightheadedness or dizziness. She has been using 2L nasal canula
at home and this has not changed. She has complained of mild
shortness of breath with exertion but this is unchanged for the
past month. No chest pain or shortness of breath. No nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria. She has
had intermittent leg swelling but no leg pain. She has bilateral
tremor at rest. All other review of systems is negative in
detail. On the day of presentation she was noted to have low
grade fevers with intermittent episodes of heavy coughing with a
choking sensation. On one occassion she brought up a small
amount of pink material which is what prompted her niece to
bring her to the emergency room.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 100.1 BP: 111/64 HR: 90 R: 36 O2
sat 91% on 2L. Her blood pressures ranted from the low 80s to
90s systolic with heart rate in the 80s. She initially required
increased supplemental oxygen of 6L but primarily was satting in
the mid 90s on 3L nasal canula. She received 2L normal saline
was persistently hypotensive and had a right IJ placed and was
started on levophed. She received aspirin 325 mg PO. she
received vancomycin 1 gram IV, ceftriaxone 1 gram IV,
levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1, aziathromycin 500 mg IV x 1 and
combivent nebulizers. Labs were notable for a WBC count of 14.7
with 87% neutrophils and acute renal failure with a creatinine
of 1.3 from baseline of 0.9. Lactate was normal at 1.8. She had
one set of negative cardiac enzymes and an EKG which showed
atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes. She had a CXR
which showed mild pulmonary edema and a CTA which was negative
for pulmonary embolism and also showed mild pulmonary edema. She
was admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
On arrival to the MICU she is alert but confused and very
talkative. She denies pain, fevers, lightheadedness, chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria,
hematuria, leg pain. She does endorse cough, rhinorrhea, sore
throat. She also endorses mild bilateral leg swelling. All other
review of systems negative in detail.
