Fever
Chest pain
Shortness of Breath

History of Present Illness:
55F with a history of rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical
mitral valve on warfarin presented to the ED with 12 hours of
sudden onset fevers, HA, and chest pain. She reports that at
approximately 10pm the night prior to admission she developed
fevers and chills along with HA and CP. She had some
palpitations as well as SOB. She reports that she often gets CP,
palpitations, and SOB at random but not associated with
exertion. This CP was different somehow. She denies cough,
mylagias, rhinorrhea, or sick contacts. She reports a tooth ache
for some time as well as some dysuria. She took tylenol for her
symptoms, with no relief. She came to the ED for further
evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were T 100.1 P 125 BP 144/69 RR
20 100 on RA. Given concern for influenza, was given a dose of
osteltamivir. A DFA for influenza was subsequently negative. She
complained of CP with radiation to the back, so was sent for CTA
to r/o dissection. CTA was negative for dissection, but she
became increasingly tachycardic after the scan. Received
lorazepam 0.5mg IV x 2 and morphine 4mg IV x 1 but continued to
be anxious and tachycardic. She then received lorazepam 1mg IV
without change in tachycardia, but became somnolent and was
placed on an NRB. Then spiked to 104.4 with rigors. BCx x2 were
sent as well as UA and UCx. UA was bland. Received vancomycin 1g
IV x1 and pip/tazo 4.5g IV x1 as antibiosis and ketoralac 30mg
on top of ASA 325. Of note, the patient had an INR of 4.4 on
arrival in the ED.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2141-1-4**]**

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2141-1-4**]):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
         Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood
cultures
         positive for Staphylococcus aureus and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] species.

         FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

Mandible XRAY
IMPRESSION:
1. There have been multiple extractions.
2. There is periapical lucency surrounding the roots of two
right-sided
molars, raising the possiblity of abscesses.
3. Dental caries is identified.

CT CHEST
MPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary emboli.
2. Mild interlobular septal thickening could reflect mild
pulmonary edema. No
pleural effusion.
3. Hiatal hernia.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

1st TEE-
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No mass or thrombus is seen in
the right atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the descendin
