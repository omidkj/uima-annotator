Pertinent Results:
Cerebral Angiogram:
[**2162-4-8**] Extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Given the predominant location of intracranial hemorrhage in the
cistern of lamina terminalis, the likely potential source of
bleeding is considered anterior communicating artery. However,
no discrete aneurysm formation

[**2162-4-8**] CT Brain - Interval placement of ventricular drain with
slight decrease in ventricular size.

[**2162-4-8**] MRI Brain w/w/o contrast - Abnormal enhancement is seen
in the suprasellar region  surrounding the hemorrhage extending
to the sellar region suspicious for a suprasellar mass. Given
the location, there is suspicion for craniopharyngioma. However,
the tumor characteristics are somewhat altered secondary to
hemorrhage and compression.

[**2162-4-9**] - No change in the ventricular or suprasellar
hemorrhage. As noted on the prior study, the suprasellar clot
demonstrates peripheral enhancement which is unchanged.

[**2162-4-9**] CT brain - Postoperative changes related to right
ventriculostomy catheter placement with fluid and air along its
course. Right lateral ventricular blood clot has been evacuated.
The left ventriculostomy catheter is in unchanged position. The
left lateral ventricle is diminished in size compared to
[**2162-4-8**] exam.  Heterogeneous suprasellar hemorrhagic mass is
stable in appearance.

[**2162-4-10**] MRI brain - Status post resection of the suprasellar
mass. Blood products are seen with post-surgical changes in the
region. Some residual enhancement is identified surrounding the
blood clot since the previous study. No acute infarcts are seen.
Some restricted diffusion at the margin of surgical cavity
appears to be related to patient's surgical procedure.

[**4-15**] CT brain - stable position of [**Month/Year (2) 5041**] drains bilaterally.  No
evidence of hydrocephalus.  stable suprasellar hemorrhage

[**4-15**] CT brain - s/p [**Month/Year (2) **] removal.  No evidence fo acute
hemorrhage or hydrocephalus


[**4-18**] CTA Chest- Thrombus is present in the left lower lobe
segmental pulmonary arteries. There is no significant evidence
of right heart strain, however, the RV/LV ratio is difficult to
assess as the left ventricle is predominantly in systole during
the examination.

[**4-18**] CT Head- Post-operative changes following right craniotomy
for resection of suprasellar mass. Overlying subgaleal fluid
collection is noted, possibly increased from prior studies.
Hematoma within the suprasellar cistern decreased in size and
conspicuity, compatible with expected evolution of blood
products. No new hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect. No
hydrocephalus.

[**4-19**] LENI's- No evidence of residual DVT in either lower
extremity.

[**4-20**] CT Head: 1. Interval enlargement of the subgaleal fluid
collection overlying the right frontal craniotomy. 2. No
evidence of interval change in the intracranial compartment. No
hydrocephalus.

[**4-22**] CT Head: Stable ventricular size.  Decrease in subgaleal
collection as 60cc was reportedly aspirated.

[**4-23**] CT head:  slight reaccumulation of subgaleal collection.
stable ventricular size


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 15852**] was intubated in the emergency room for Left frontal
[**Known lastname 5041**] placement. She was taken to angiogram the following day to
evaluate for an underlying vascular lesion.  She was started on
Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.

Angiogram was negative for an AVM or aneurysm.  An MRI of the
brain with contrast revealed a small enhancing lesion above the
pituitary gland. During her post angio course patient had
diabetes insipidus on [**2162-4-8**].  Her sodium rapidly increased
from 141 to 157.  Her sodium elevated to 162.  PT was given
DDAVP and endocrine was consulted for further management.  She
continued to have increase urine output, but improved with
DDAVP.

Patient remained intubated and was taken to the operating room
on [**4-9**] for Right frontal craniotomy resection of sella/supra
sellar mass and right [**Month/Year (2) 5041**] placement.  Please review dictated
operative report for details.  Postoperatively she was started
on Dexamethasone for cerebral edema.  She remained intubated
post-op and was transferred to the neuro ICU for further
management. She had a post operative head CT and MRI which
showed partial resection of sellar mass and post operative
changes.  There was no evidence infarct or acute hemorrhages.
She was extubated without incident and continued to be monitored
with prn DDAVP for high urine output and elevated Serum Na.

Bilateral [**Month/Year (2) 5041**] wean was begun on [**4-12**].  Pt tolerated it without
elevation of ICPs or increased headache. On 4.26 her [**Month/Year (2) 5041**]'s were
rasied to 20cm of H2O and she toelrated it well until the
mornign of 4.27 when she was ntoed to have leakage around the
[**Month/Year (2) 5041**] site on the right side. A stitch was placed and no further
leakage was noted. A NCHCT was obtained to assess for
hydrocephalus which showed stable ventricular size. Following
this her [**Month/Year (2) 5041**]'s were clamped. She was transitioned to Oral DDAVP
per Endocrine team.  Dexamethasone was slowly tapered every
other day to 2mg [**Hospital1 **] .

On [**4-15**] a repeat Head CT showed stable size of lateral
ventricles without evidence of HCP.  Thus [**Name2 (NI) 5041**]'s were removed in
routine fashion without incident.  Another repeat head CT
deomonstrated no acute hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.  She was
transferred to SDU in stable condition for frequent neuro checks
and for monitor UO.  Overnight, sodium decreased to 132 and
given concern for SIADH patient was fluid restricted.  Endocrine
rec: qid serum sodiums.
On [**4-18**] the patient was neurologically stable but she was
tachycardic to the 140's. This was discussed with endocrine and
IVF bolus was recommended. She was also febrile to 102.1 so a
fever work up was sent. Her u/a was significant for infection so
she was started on a course of cipro and her foley was changed.
She then began putting out excessive amounts of
