Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9871**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
42 y/o F PMH Breast Cancer metastatic to lungs, cranium, spine
(epidural T1/T4, cervical/upper thoracic spine) and bone (spine
and sternum) and leptomeniges. According to recent Oncology
notes current treatment is Doxorubicin (last treatment
[**2141-12-26**]), steroids and s/p XRT for leptomenigeal disease.
Patient currently intubated consequently history from OMR and
family.
.
Patient presented to ED T 95.3, BP 129/95, HR 98, O2 Sat 100% (?
oxygen) and triggered for respiratory distress. She was placed
on NRB with O2 Sat 93%. Respiratory status worsened despite
inhalers and patient became increasing somnelent and
consequently was intubated. Patient was given levaquin for
concern of PNA.
.
Per family patient had 1 week history of SOB with exertion.
Breathing increasingly laboured over the past week at rest.
Family reports several months of SOB but with exertion only.
Denies associated fever, chills, cough, hemopytsis. Daughter has
cold, but not severe and requires no antibiotics. No chest pain.
Does report bloody nose last night and usually every other week.
Mother reports patient more disoriented this afternoon and
easily tired. Family not aware of lung metastasis.
.
Of note patient's most recent admission [**2141-10-17**] for headaches
started on steroids/radiation therapy, dyspnea ruled out for PE
felt to be secondary to metastasis. Recent Heme Onc notes
notable for agitation/hallucinations felt to be related to
steroids.

Select Reports:
-CTA: 1. No pulmonary embolus. 2. Progression of metastatic
disease involving mediastinal and right hilar nodes. True extent
of malignancy likely underestimated by low lung volumes and
bibasilar consolidations, due to combination of aspiration and
pneumonia. 3. Given septal thickening at least in part due to
pulmonary edema, lymphangitic spread of carcinomatosis would be
difficult to exclude. 4. Left breast nodule, though
subcentimeter, is larger than in [**2141-8-30**].
.
-TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2140-9-29**], probably no major change.
.
-CT Head: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in
size and configuration. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is
well preserved. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
clear and well aerated. Re-demonstrated is diffuse metastastic
involvement of the calvarium and skull base.
.
-CXR on day of discharge [**2142-1-3**]: In comparison with the study of
[**1-2**], there is increasing diffuse bilateral pulmonary
opacifications. In view of the enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette and blunting costophrenic angles, this could well
represent pulmonary edema. However, the possibility of
supervening pneumonia or even ARDS would have to be considered.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 42 year old female PMH metastatic breast cancer (lung,
spine and leptomeningeal) who presents with respiratory distress
of 1 week duration requiring intubation on arrival to ED. No
specific cause was found for her deterioration whcich was put
down to disease progression following an unchanged TTE, negative
CT-PA for PE, no evidence radiologically for DVTs and no culture
data to suggest an infectious precipitant.
.
.
# Respiratory Distress: Thsi was considered likely due to
progression of knoen metastatic breast cancer. Her primary
oncologist felt that she should not be intubated again. Mrs
[**Known lastname 98114**] was celebrating birthday with family, unable to blow
candles out. She then noted increasing sob, family called EMS.
On NRB at presentation to the EW, sO2 91%. A&O at that time and
stated she would like to be intubated, if needed. She then ecame
tachypneic and lethargic and was intubated and commenced on
propofol. She was transferred to the MICU for further care CXR
showed no evidence of pneumonia. Sputum revealed respiratory
commensal flora. Given progressive shortness of breath without
symptoms of cough/fever concerning for PE especially in setting
of known metastatic disease. She therefore had a CT-[**MD Number(3) 24709**]
showed no evidence of PE but did show progression of metastatic
disease involving mediastinal and right hilar nodes. In
addition, teh report noted that given septal thickening at least
in part due to pulmonary edema, lymphangitic spread of
carcinomatosis was considered difficult to exclude. The Left
breast nodule, was larger than in [**2141-8-3
