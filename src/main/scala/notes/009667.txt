Admission Date:  [**2185-11-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2185-12-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**2107-12-26**]       Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hematemesis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old male with
a history of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease
(status post a coronary artery bypass graft with one
thrombosed graft as of [**2184**]) who presented with multiple
episodes of coffee-grounds emesis at his nursing home on the
day of admission.

His [**Doctor Last Name 3945**] has also been noted to be dark brown or black in
the few days prior to admission.  He was seen in the
Emergency Department where his temperature was 100.5, and his
respiratory rate was approximately 32, with a blood pressure
of 145/64.  A nasogastric tube lavage was done with one liter
of coffee-grounds and bloody fluid that never cleared with
lavage.  For this reason, he was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit.

Also of note, on the History of Present Illness, the emesis
began after lunch on the day of admission.  He has also had
brown loose diarrhea with multiple sick contacts at his
nursing home.  He denied any abdominal pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Hypertension.
 2.  Atrial fibrillation.
 3.  Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2176**].
 4.  Diabetes.
 5.  Congestive heart failure.
 6.  Chronic renal failure (with a baseline creatinine of
2.1).
 7.  Hypercholesterolemia.
 8.  Peripheral vascular disease.
 9.  A left eye thrombosis.
10.  Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
11.  Status post pacemaker placement.
12.  Legally blind.
13.  Peptic ulcer disease.
14.  Left lower quadrant surgery of unknown type.

ALLERGIES:  Allergies included a possible allergy to
CONTRAST.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications upon admission
included digoxin, Lasix, Lopressor, Procardia, Coumadin,
aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril, and Flomax.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on presentation revealed temperature was 100.5, blood
pressure was 113/57, heart rate was 97 (in atrial
fibrillation), respiratory rate was approximately 40, and the
patient was saturating approximately 100% on nonrebreather.
In general, the patient was awake and alert, oriented times
two.  He was in some mild respiratory distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination revealed mucous membranes
were dry.  Minimal jugular venous distention.  His
cardiovascular examination revealed a tachycardic heart that
was irregular with faint heart sounds.  The lungs revealed
coarse breath sounds bilaterally with rhonchi; especially at
the right base.  The abdomen revealed a midline abdominal
scar which was well-healed; otherwise, the abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended, and with present bowel sounds
(but diminished).  The extremities showed no ulcers and 1+
ankle edema bilaterally with venous stasis dermatitis.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
upon presentation revealed white blood cell count was 10.7,
hematocrit was 43.9, and platelets were 174.  Chemistry-7 was
remarkable for a blood urea nitrogen of 74, and a creatinine
of 2.5, with a glucose of 310.  Anion gap was 23.  His
digoxin level was checked and was 1.  His first creatine
kinase was checked and was 209, with a MB fraction of 18.
His troponin came back at 17.5.  His INR was 2 at this time.
An arterial blood gas was done.  The numbers were 7.28 with a
PO2 of 95, and a PCO2 of 33 on 100% nonrebreather.  Lactate
level was 6.4.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   An electrocardiogram showed atrial
fibrillation at 136 with a left bundle-branch block.

A chest x-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:

1.  MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  The patient ruled for a
myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes due to demand
ischemia; likely related to tachycardia from his anemia.  He
was rate controlled with diltiazem initially and then with a
beta blocker.  He was watched closely on telemetry.  Because
of his myocardial infarction, he went into new heart failure
which was documented by a cardiac echocardiogram which
documented a new ejection fraction during this hospital stay
of about 20% to 25%.

2.  ANEMIA SECONDARY TO GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient
bled down to a hematocrit of approximately 34.  He needed
about five units of fresh frozen plasma to reverse his
coagulopathy due to Coumadin.  He only needed one unit of
packed red blood cells.  He had no further episodes of active
hematemesis.

The Gastroenterology team saw the patient in consultation and
decided not to do an upper endoscopy due to his acute
myocardial infarction.  They suggested conservative
management.  He continued to do well and was transferred to
the floor with no further episodes of bleeding and
guaiac-negative stools since.  His hematocrit remained
stable.  A possible etiology was peptic ulcer disease versus
an arteriovenous malformation versus [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
This was not made clear on this admission and the patient
will likely need followup by primary care physician.

3.  PNEUMONIA/TACHYPNEA:  Pneumonia and tachypnea was thought
likely due to acute uremia and lactic acidosis, but also with
concern for pneumonia.  He was put on vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  Later he was just placed on
levofloxacin and Flagyl for his pneumonia.

4.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  He had a mild increase in his
creatinine which basically resolved as his cardiac issues
resolved.

5.  HEMATURIA:  The patient had blood in his Foley in the
Intensive Care Unit as well as on the medical floor.  This
was thought due to Foley trauma.  He was given a voiding
trial with the Foley and restarted on his Flomax so that he
could void more easily.

6.  PULMONARY EDEMA:  With his new ejection fraction, the
patient had pulmonary edema and was diuresed gently with his
standing dose of Lasix of 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.  He was
orthostatic during his hospital course, but this gradually
improved with activity with Physical Therapy.  He had an
oxygen requirement of approximately 2 liters to 3 liters of
oxygen which decreased by the time of discharge.

7.  METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS SCREEN:  He
did have a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus screen
here of the nares which were positive.

8.  HEART FAILURE:  The patient was started back on his ACE
inhibitor as his renal function improved.  He was also on his
beta blocker.  Any aspirin or Coumadin was held at this time,
and was just restarted on his Lasix standing dose.  He was
also kept on his digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.

9.  DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient had episodes of fasting
hypoglycemia; and accordingly, his evening dose of NPH was
titrated down to achieve a satisfactory glucose in the
morning.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   Discharge status was to rehabilitation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  NPH 22 units subcutaneously in the morning and 8 units
subcutaneously in the evening.
6.  Flomax (as his previous dose).

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
 1.  Hematemesis of unknown etiology.
 2.  Status post myocardial infarction related to demand
ischemia due to anemia.
 3.  Recent possible pneumonia.
 4.  Hypertension.
 5.  Atrial fibrillation.
 6.  Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery
bypass graft.
 7.  Diabetes mellitus.
 8.  Congestive heart failure (with a new ejection fraction
of 20%).
 9.  Chronic renal failure.
10.  Hypercholesterolemia.
11.  Peripheral vascular disease.
12.  Left eye thrombosis.
13.  Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
14.  Status post pacemaker placement.
15.  Legally blind.
16.  Peptic ulcer disease.
17.  Left lower quadrant surgery.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:   The patient was to follow
up with his primary care physician (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 172**]).
