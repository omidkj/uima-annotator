Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress, hypoxia, tachycardia, fever, chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Nasogastric Tube
Left elbow joint aspiration

History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 87 y/o with a history of Dementia, thrombocytosis on
hydroxyurea, TIA, seizure, and gout, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
from NH with hypoxia of 84% RA --> 97% 15L after being noted by
nursing staff to be gurgling as well as nasal congestion and
drainage early in the morning. Pt was given combivent nebs at
the NH and at the time was noted to be afebrile with temp of
98F, P 100, RR 20, BP 136/68. Later in the afternoon, the
patient was noted to have some difficulty breathing, and at that
time was found to be 84% on RA.
.
On arrival to ER pt was found to have TMax 102.2, Tachy to
120's, SBP 130's, and initially 100% on non-rebreather.  Pt was
able to be weaned down to a 50% FM (98%), and HR improved to
100's after 1L IV fluids. CXR: showed a possible LLL pna, and a
chest CTA was negative for PE, but did show a L sided
consolidation.  Pt recieved Levaquin, Cefepime, Vanco while in
the ED and arrived to the MICU satting 96% on 5L NC.
.
Of note, the patient had been recieving Penicillin VK 250mg po
QID since [**7-6**] following a recent dental procedure.

Pertinent Results:
[**2197-7-16**] [**Year (4 digits) 5283**] Ultrasound
<br>
IMPRESSION:
Unremarkable right upper quadrant ultrasound. Please note,
failure to image the gallbladder may be due to prior
cholecystectomy or due to collapsed state. No intrahepatic
ductal dilatation.
<br>
[**2197-7-16**] CTA CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
3. Calcification of the coronary arteries and aorta.
4. 4 mm pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe. Based on risk
factors, [**5-18**] month follow up is recommended.
<br>
[**2197-7-17**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
CONCLUSIONS:
1. Age-related diffuse cerebral atrophy and ventricular
enlargement, stable since [**2196-7-6**].
2. Bilateral lacunar infarcts in the basal ganglia and small
vessel ischemic disease.
3. Periodontoid pannus in keeping with possible rheumatoid
arthritis or pseudogout. Clinical correlation is recommended.
4. Overall, if clinical concern is high for acute ischemic
disease, an MRI evaluation of the brain would be helpful.
<br>
[**2197-7-17**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
Left retrocardiac alveolar opacity associated with left small
pleural effusion is new, consistent with pneumonia or
aspiration. Less marked right basal alveolar opacity increased,
could be due to atelectasis, multifocal aspiration or pneumonia.
There is no right pleural effusion. There is no vascular
congestion. Tortuosity and calcifications of the aorta are
unchanged.
<br>
[**2197-7-25**] CXR
FINDINGS: The enteric tube reaches the stomach. The
cardiomediastinal contours are stable. There is no evidence of
central lymphadenopathy. Bibasilar consolidations have improved.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions. Pulmonary
vascularity is normal. There is no pneumothorax. IMPRESSION:
Interval improvement in left lower and right lower lobe
consolidations. No radiographic findings to suggest interval
aspiration.
<br>
[**2197-7-29**] CT CHEST
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent consolidation and atelectasis involving the
majority of the left lower lobe. The patency of the left lower
lobe bronchus is in question, and a small obstructing mass
cannot be excluded. Correlation with bronchoscopy is
recommended.
2. New small region of consolidation in the right lower lobe.
This may be due to aspiration or atelectasis.
3. Mild right lower lobe bronchiectasis.
4. Stable small right upper lobe nodule.
5. A few borderline mediastinal lymph nodes.
6. Small calcified granuloma in the spleen.
7. Bilateral non-obstructing nephrolithiasis.
8. Bilateral glenohumeral degenerative changes.
9. Central venous catheter tip in the superior vena cava.
10. Small fat containing anterior abdominal wall hernia.
<br>
[**2197-7-29**] BILAT UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND
IMPRESSION: Thrombosis involving the left cephalic and basilic
veins. No
evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the right or left upper
extremity.
<br>
[**2197-8-1**] CXR (PA and LAT)
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the
right-sided PICC line is in unchanged position. The retrocardiac
opacity shows subtotal resolution, in the left basal lung. Very
subtle remnant peribronchial opacitie are seen. There is no
evidence of newly appeared parenchymal opacities, and no
evidence of pleural effusion. The size of the cardiac silhouette
is at the upper range of normal, there is no evidence of
overhydration.
