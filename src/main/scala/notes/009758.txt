Chief Complaint:
Obstructive Uropathy/transfer from [**Hospital3 26615**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Bilateral percutaneous nephrotomy tubes (bilaterally)
2. Cystoscopy with biopsy
3. PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
79 year old M with chronic urinary retention secondary to
prostate cancer (diagnosed in [**2186**], grade 7, stage t-3, r
seminal vessicle involvement at diagnosis). Treated with xrt and
hormonal rx at diagnosis. Had TURP [**2193**], did well following this
and self-cathed for urinary retention. (See urology OSH note in
back of chart for detail on urethral problems). In [**9-16**] had
foley placement complicated by false passage. Since then
difficultly cathing himself. Saw his urologist prior to his
admission to [**Hospital3 26615**] [**12-15**] and was noted to have fecal
material in his urine after a foley was passed.  Due to
suspicion of enterovesical fistula the patient was admitted.
Upon admission his creatinine was noted to be 6.4 up from a
baseline of 1.0.  A gastrograffin enema and a cystogram was done
showing a large filling defect involving the bladder, but no
frank fistula. Due to hyperkalemia is was ultimately admitted to
the ICU. A temporary dialysis line was placed and he was
dialyzed for hyperkalemia.
.
Of note, the patient was also noted to have lytic lesions of the
spine and has been recieving radation to his lumbar spine.  A
biopsy has shown squamous cell carcinoma.
.
Pt is a vague historian, but accurate with most details.

STUDIES
-------
[**2196-12-19**] Renal ultrasound
The right kidney measures 12.6 cm. The left kidney measures 11.9
cm. Moderate hydronephrosis is seen within bilateral kidneys. No
definite renal stone or mass is identified.

Bladder measures 11.3 x 7.7 x 7.5 cm and contains a large
heterogeneous mass with internal vascularity consistent with
tumor. A Foley balloon is identified within the bladder.
Attempts were made to fill the bladder with saline to better
evaluate the mass; however, patient could not tolerate more than
5 cc.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral moderate hydronephrosis. Large
heterogeneous mass filling the bladder lumen consistent with
tumor.
.
[**2196-12-21**] CT abdomen and pelvis
Study is compared with outside ([**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital) _____ CT,
dated [**12-15**], as well as interval renal [**Name (NI) 75758**], dated [**2196-12-19**].
Evaluation of the urinary tract, in particular, the bladder, is
limited by the lack of intravenous contrast material. However,
the bladder is markedly abnormal in overall appearance: It is
quite distended, despite the presence of _____ heterogeneous,
predominantly attenuation (40 [**Doctor Last Name **]) material corresponding to the
apparently known mass, demonstrated by [**Name (NI) 13416**], whose margins
cannot be defined. The bladder also contains numerous small gas
pockets, likely related to either the Foley catheter placement,
biopsy or other reasons; GI tract is not excluded, though none
is demonstrated. There is ill-defined haziness in the adjacent
fat of the prevesicular space of Retzius, superficial to the air
pockets, no definite extravesical extension is demonstrated.
There is no adenopathy, and no other pelvic adenopathy is seen.

Since the previous studies, bilateral nephrostomy tubes have
been placed, with pigtail loops in both renal pelves, draining
externally and the previously-demonstrated hydronephrosis is no
longer seen; there is persistent right more than left
hydroureter, incompletely characterized. There is relatively
slight perinephric soft tissue stranding, unchanged, and no
significant air is identified in the upper urinary tract, though
there is a small pocket of air in the left posterior pararenal
space, likely related to the recent tube placement. There is no
free retro- or peritoneal _____ air, and the small and large
bowel loops are relatively well-opacified and not distended,
with transit of contrast material into normal-appearing large
bowel, and no extraluminal contrast to suggest bowel
perforation. There is extensive, circumferential calcification
of the thoracoabdominal aorta and its branches; the abdominal
aorta measures some 2.9 cm in maximal diameter (2:46), without
frank aneurysmal dilatation. There is no intramural hematoma or
discrete peri-aortic fat-stranding to suggest "leak" limited
evaluation of the _____. There is no free fluid in the abdomen.

There is marked _____ cardiomegaly with multi-chamber
enlargement. There is extensive diffuse coronary arterial
calcification. Dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker in situ, with
apparently intact leads. There are small-moderate bilateral
pleural effusions with associated passive atelectasis. There is
also some interlobular septal thickening with patchy
ground-glass opacity, as well as prominence of the more-anterior
vessels, all consistent with underlying CHF. A focal
consolidation at the _____ aspect of the left lung base cannot
be excluded. No pericardial effusion is seen. Destructive
process involving the right L5 vertebral body, extending into
and largely replacing the cortex and right posterior elements
_____ a large soft tissue component, displacing the thecal sac
to the left, and deforming it. ______ the right neural foramen,
inseparable from the exiting right L5 nerve root, likely
preexistent. Though there are multilevel degenerative changes
elsewhere, no other destructive lesion is identified. There is
anterior wedging of the T7 vertebral body, with a mixed
sclerotic appearance which may represent a previously-treated
metastasis or, alternatively, ______ hemangioma. No similar
appearance is seen elsewhere.

IMPRESSION:
1. Markedly abnormal appearance to the bladder, which is
distended and may be largely filled with apparently-known soft
tissue mass. This is incompletely characterized, due to lack of
contrast enhancement. Numerous air pockets in the bladder may
relate to recent interventions, including biopsy, but should be
correlated clinically.
2. Status post interval placement of bilateral nephrostomy tubes
with external drainage, and virtual c
