Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
87-year-old female with a history of known coronary artery
disease with three VD, refused CABG in the past,
hypertension, high cholesterol, who presented with acute
onset of shortness of breath and respiratory distress to
[**Hospital **] Hospital.  The patient had been in her usual state of
health until 5 am on the day of admission when she developed
sudden shortness of breath.  At [**Hospital **] Hospital she was
noted to have a saturation of 84% on a nonrebreather.  ABG
showed pH of 7.14, and pO2 of 66.  The patient was intubated
with slight improvement at 7.28, 51, and 200.  She was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**], where she arrived intubated
on a nitro drip, having already received some Lasix at
[**Location (un) **].  She had received Lasix that resulted in decrease in
her blood pressure to the 140s from the 180s with a good
urine output.  Upon arrival in our emergency room she
received 40 mg more of IV Lasix and the ABG at that time
showed 7.36, 50, and 192.  Upon arrival to [**Location (un) **], the
patient denied any chest pain, but noted shortness of breath.
Her first CK and troponin were flat.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  CAD with three VD.  The patient had a catheterization one
year ago that showed as follows:  LAD with a 99% proximal
stenosis, circumflex with a 90% discrete proximal stenosis,
RCA with a total occlusion in the proximal segment.  The
patient has refused CABG.  She had an echocardiogram one year
ago that showed the EF of 15%.
2.  High cholesterol.
3.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (per report)
1.  Nadolol.
2.  Lasix.
3.  Aspirin.
4.  Isordil.
5.  Accupril.
6.  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**].
7.  Zocor.
8.  Plavix.

After the patient was extubated per her report, the
medications she was taking were as follows:

1.  Nadolol 40 q.d.
2.  Lasix 40 b.i.d.
3.  Isordil 40 t.i.d.
4.  Aspirin.

The patient had discontinued Plavix, as well as her ACE
inhibitor and statin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient DEVELOPS A SKIN REACTION FROM PLAVIX.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone in [**Location (un) **]; one son
lives nearby and one son lives in [**Name (NI) 531**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the pulse of 58,
blood pressure 132/65.  Vent was at IMV with a rate of 10,
tidal volume of 500, FIO2 of 100% and a PEEP of 5.  ABG:
Settings of 7.36, 50, and 192.  GENERAL:  The patient was
intubated and arousable.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light; ETT in place, OG in place.  NECK:  Neck
was supple.  LUNGS:  Basilar rales anteriorly.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular, normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient is intubated and sedated,
arousable and moving all extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  Data on admission revealed the following:
Labs at the outside hospital were significant for a CK of 37,
troponin of less than 0.2, normal CBC and chemistry, lipase
of 347, and amylase of 107.  Upon arrival here, white count
was 14.2, hematocrit 37, platelet count 791,000, sodium 134,
potassium 4.4, chloride 99, bicarbonate 26, BUN 25 and
creatinine 1.0 with a glucose of 102, CK 70, troponin 1.8,
INR of 1.7 and PTT of 139.  EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at a
rate of 57 with normal axis and normal intervals with Q wave
in three and T-wave flattening in 1, AVL, and V6.  Chest
x-ray:  ETT tube in place with pulmonary edema and possible
right upper lobe infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 87-year-old female with
known severe coronary artery disease, who presented with
acute onset of pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and acidosis
requiring intubation at an outside hospital.  By arrival to
[**Hospital1 69**] the acidosis and hypoxia
were improved status post intubation and diuresis.

CARDIAC:  The patient has known three VD as noted above.  She
has refused CABG or catheterization at this time.  Heparin
was continued and aspirin was continued.  Plavix was not
resumed due to a skin reaction the patient develops with
Plavix.

The CKs and troponins were cycled.  She had a peak troponin
of 2.6 on the 27th.

MYOCARDIUM:  The patient comes in heart failure, requiring
intubation.  She was placed on ACE inhibitor and nitrates.
Initially, she was on a nitroglycerin grip, which was changed
to p.o. nitrates.  The CHF improved, status post IV Lasix.
The patient was able to be extubated on the day after
admission without difficulty.  She was transferred to the
floor and later that evening, the same day of extubation, she
again developed flash pulmonary edema that was unresponsive
to 120 IV Lasix.  The patient required repeat intubation at
that time.  She was able to be extubated within 12 hours of
the second extubation.  Of note, on the second intubation,
she again had a respiratory acidosis with pH of 7.11.  She
was hypoxic with oxygen saturation of 78% on a nonrebreather.
All of these numbers improved after re-intubation.  She also
showed some ST depression in 1, 2, AVL, V5 and V6 during that
episode.  The CK and troponins did not lump after the
reintubation.  The patient was easily extubated the day
following and aggressively diuresed with p.o. and IV Lasix
with a goal of one liter negative daily.  By the day of
discharge, the patient was on 80 b.i.d. of p.o. Lasix and she
has been receiving p.r.n. Lasix to keep her a liter negative.
The rales have significantly improved on examination, such
that on the 31st, she just had basilar rales and she was over
one liter and one half negative for her fluid balance.  She
was titrated up on her Isordil and Captopril and on Captopril
25 t.i.d. and Isordil 30 t.i.d. on discharge.  Medications
were limited based on initial hypotension, which gradually
improved, such that her blood pressures were in the high 90s
to the one teens.  Beta-blocker was not restarted due to her
bradycardia in the 50s to 60s.  This needs to be resumed by
the patient's primary cardiologist.  The patient remained in
normal sinus rhythm with one episode of SVT on telemetry and
no other events.

PULMONARY:  The patient arrived intubated for flash pulmonary
edema.  The patient was extubated the next day.  She
developed flash pulmonary edema again and required
intubation.  She was extubated quickly and then her pulmonary
status remained good.  She was weaned off O2 and at the time
of discharge the saturations were 95% to 100% on room air.

GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient presented with elevated
Amulase and lipase.  These were repeated and came into within
normal limits at our hospital.  We did not work this up
further.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient initially presented with
elevated white count and a question of infiltrate on chest
x-ray.  On repeat x-ray this resolved and sputum cultures
were negative for infection.

HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had a thrombocytosis most likely
reactive.  She was initially on heparin, which was continued
and discontinued several days prior to discharge.  She was
continued on aspirin and Plavix.  This was discontinued due
to her skin reaction to the Plavix.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient has improved CHF at the time
of discharge.  The patient is on increased doses of Lasix,
Captopril, and Isordil.  Medications will need to be titrated
up per the rehabilitation and per the patient's primary
cardiologist.  Beta-blocker ultimately should be
re-administered.

The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation
on the following medications:

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Isordil 30 mg p.o.t.i.d.
3.  Captopril 25 p.o.t.i.d.
4.  Aspirin 325 p.o.q.d.
5.  Colace 100 p.o.b.i.d.
6.  Senna and Dulcolax p.r.n.

FOLLOW-UP CARE:  The patient needs to followup with
Dr.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4640**], cardiologist in [**Location (un) **].  Phone #:
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 37180**].  She should followup in one
