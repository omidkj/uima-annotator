Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5880**]
Chief Complaint:
Motor vehicle accident [The patient was an unrestrained driver
who hit a bridge wall. Atthe scene, he was awake, c/o CP/SOB. By
report, he had seizure activity in transit.]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
 63yo M who was in a motor vehicle collision who was
treated at an outside hospital, had a left chest tube placed
and was intubated and was brought to [**Hospital1 **] for further treatment and care.

The patient was an unrestrained driver who hit a bridge wall. At
the scene, he was awake, c/o CP/SOB. By report, he had seizure
activity in transit.

Upon arrival to trauma and undergoing resuscitation the patient
was found to be hypotensive and had ended up having a positive
DTL. He went into PEA and had chest tube placed without blood
back, had CPR, epi/atropine x 1 and was successfully
resuscitated. He was deemed too unstable for the CT scanner and
was brought emergently to the OR. He underwent ex-lap, which
revealed pelvic hematoma. He also had a bolt placed, with
opening
pressure 80. Maximum GCS here was 3. Pupils were unreactive on
exam, no response to painful stimuli in any extremities.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -76 BY SAME PHYSICIAN

AP VIEW OF THE CHEST (TWO RADIOGRAPHS): In the interval, there
has been placement of a second tube in the left hemithorax with
tip in the apex. Large left pneumothorax is unchanged. Interval
improvement of right upper lobe collapse with increase in
aeration. Otherwise, there are no changes.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2121-8-8**] 2:23 PM

CT CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST

IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple injuries, including rib fracture, scapular fracture,
pneumothorax, pleural effusions (hemothorax could not be
excluded due to limitation by extensive streaky artifact),
pulmonary embolus, right upper lobe consolidation, subcutaneous
emphysema, large fluid collection with air in the mid abdomen,
large hematoma in the pelvis, pelvic fractures. Spleen
laceration cannot be excluded.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color,
and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left superficial femoral
and popliteal, as well as right common femoral veins was
performed. Evaluation of the left common femoral vein was
limited by overlying bandages. There is normal compression,
color flow, augmentation, and waveforms. There is no evidence of
deep vein thrombosis.

IMPRESSION:

No deep vein thrombosis in the right or left superficial femoral
and popliteal veins, or the right common femoral vein. This is a
limited examination.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  [**2121-8-13**] 8:55 PM

FINDINGS: Supine abdominal radiograph was reviewed. Immediately
prior to acquisition of the radiograph, contrast was injected
via the G- and J-tubes. There is contrast within the stomach
without evidence for extravasation. Contrast is present in the
jejunum without gross extravasation.

IMPRESSION: No gross extravasation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

PORTABLE AP CHEST.

COMPARISON: [**2121-8-13**].

There is no definitive pneumothorax on the left. Note that the
left costophrenic sulcus is not included in the film. The chest
tubes, the ET tube, and right subclavian catheter are in good
position. Bilateral lung opacities may be consistent with
resolving contusions. Essentially no change from the lung
findings from prior radiograph.


Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2121-8-7**] after
sustaining a motor vehicle crash while driving as an
unrestrained passenger and hitting a bridge (brick wall/pylon).
He was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] as a transfer patient and there was
seizure activity while in transit. He was also intubated before
being brought to [**Hospital1 18**] and a left chest tube was placed for a
left sided pneumothorax. At [**Hospital1 18**], his injuries were noted as
the following: Mutiple scalp / facial lacerations with bleeding,
Persistent pneumothorax on left, No obvious pelvic fx. There was
a witness arrest in trauma bay and the ACLS protocol ini
