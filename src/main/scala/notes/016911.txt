Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, cough


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 40553**] is an 88yoF with h/o Alzeihmer's dementia who p/w SOB
and new onset productive cough that started as a dry cough 3
days prior. She has had this since awakening this AM, worsening
throughout the day. EMS called for rr30's, SaO2 80's, but
afebrile by report. No O2 sat recorded there but 86% on RA per
EMS. Pt denies CP. States never been SOB previously. Per family,
no hx of CHF. Denies increased LE edema. States she felt well
when she went to bed yesterday evening. Never had these symptoms
before.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  96.4 104 168/84 36 95% 10L
Non-Rebreather. CXR showed lower lobe, BL opacities c/w PNA,
aspiration, or atelectasis. Some vascular prominence concerning
for mild edema. BNP 4300. WBC 13 with neutrophil predominence.
Initial cardiac enzymes show CK-MB 11, MBI 5.4, troponin 0.11.
Discussed with cardiology who thought that MICU would be
appropirate given absence of cardiac history and no evidence of
ischemic changse on EKG. Given ASA, nitro SL, lasix 40mg IV x1,
vanc/ceftriaxone for HCAP.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient has advanced dementia and
can not participate in the interview. Talking to her son and
HCP, he says that she has been in her USOH until this AM. She
lives in an Alzheimers community. Her PMH is only significant
for hyperlipidemia and ? silent MI in the past. Her vitals on
admission are 99.9 ax, 94, 95% on CPAP 5/5.

MICRO DATA:
[**2149-2-16**] URINE Legionella Urinary Antigen: negative
[**2149-2-16**] BLOOD CULTURE x 2 (pending)
.
CXR [**2149-2-16**]:
IMPRESSION: Basilar opacities worrisome for pneumonia in the
appropriate
clinical setting although lower airway inflammation, atelectasis
or even
aspiration are other etiologies that could be considered in the
appropriate clinical setting. Although there is perhaps minimal
vascular prominence, since opacities are focal in the lower
lungs, pulmonary edema is doubted as the primary etiology but
could be seen with an atypical pattern.
.
TTE [**2149-2-17**]:
IMPRESSION: Critical aortic valve stenosis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Increased PCWP.
.
CTA [**2149-2-17**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for PE.

2. Multifocal pneumonia involving the right upper, middle and
both lower
lobes with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.

3. No evidence for a mass.
.
Bladder ultrasound:
IMPRESSION: Foley catheter present within a collapsed bladder.
Superior to
the bladder there is a large cystic structure with no internal
nodules
identified. This may represent a paraovarian or ovarian cyst or
peritoneal
inclusion cyst. MRI pelvis is suggested for further
characterization

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospitalization Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 40553**] is an 88y/o lady with advanced Alzheimer's dementia
who presented with sudden-onset SOB, cough, and slight fever.
She was admitted to the MICU, ruled out for PE, and was treated
for multifocal PNA. She completed an 8-day course of
broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia and improved greatly
from a respiratory standpoint - breathing comfortably on room
air upon discharge and afebrile. She developed rectal bleeding
late in her hospital course on [**2-21**], likely diverticular or
hemorrhoidal bleed, but was stable from a hemodynamic and
hematocrit standpt for 5 days. GI recommended against
intervention and her family was in agreement with this plan.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
#. Pneumonia: Imaging was concerning for multifocal pneumonia
and the patient presented with a significant oxygen requirement,
was on BiPAP in the ICU. She was treated initially with
vancomycin/levofloxacin, but was broadened to
vancomycin/cefepime on [**2-19**] due to continued high oxygen
requirements. There was concern for aspiration pneumonia,
however, the patient did pass her speech and swallow evaluation
- recommended regular diet and thin liquids. She continued to
improve and an 8-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics was
completed. The patient was breathing comfortably on room air on
discharge and was afebrile.
.
# Critical Aortic Stenosis: On echo, critical aortic stenosis
was discovered with value area of 0.6 cm2. The patient was
started on a low-dose beta-blocker (Toprol 25 mg qday). On
presentation, she was found to be in mildly decompensated CHF
and was gently diuresed. Discussion was held with her son and
daughter-in-law who did not want aggressive interventions -
valvuloplasty/valve replacement - considered. They agreed with
cardiology outpatient follow-up and this was arranged.
.
#. Troponin leak: Likely in the setting of illness/demand with
critical AS and LVH. The patient never complained of chest pain
and cardiac enzymes trended down (trop peaked at 0.25). She was
started on ASA 81 mg per day and BB.
.
# Rectal bleeding: The patient developed rectal bleeding on
[**2-21**]. She continued to have ~1-2 episodes of bleeding per day.
She remained completely hemodynamically stable. Her Hct was also
stable for 5 days - ~ 30. She did not require any blood
transfusions. The bleeding was discussed with gastroenterology,
who recommended against intervention - they did not want to
perform colonoscopy. They thought the bleeding was likely either
related to hemorrhoids or diverticulum. The bleeding was also
discussed with the patient's family - HCP - [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 40553**] - who did
not want aggressive interventions. She has been consented for
blood (with son as HCP). Consent is attached with paperwork.
Would only transfuse if Hct drops
