History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] is a 71 year old man with a history notable for
hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy, Afib, and Stage IIB
squamous cell lung cancer on chemo, s/p VATS RLL lobectomy
[**2146-7-25**], now C1D10 cisplatin/taxotere adjuvant chemotherapy, who
presents from heme/onc clinic with febrile neutropenia,
tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient had his first dose of
adjuvant chemo on [**9-6**] and felt well until Saturday [**9-10**]. Then,
he began to experience nausea, fatigue, poor appetite, and
diarrhea. He also felt dizzy and lightheaded occasionally. He
denied vomiting or bloody stools. His wife takes his temperature
at home and it had never been abolve 98.6.

He presented today to his oncologist's office for a routine
visit, where he was found to be neutropenic (WBC 1.6, N:7%) and
febrile to 100.8. He was also tachycardic to the 130s. He was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.

In the ED, initial VS were:  100.8 131 133/82 16 98%. His EKG
showed rapid Afib. He had a CXR that showed a RLL opacity,
consistent with mucoid impaction. He was given vamcomycin and
cefepime. He was given tylenol 1g PO. For Afib, he was given 4L
NS, diltiazem 10mg IV, metoprolol 50mg PO, and digoxin IV 0.5mg
x1, 0.25mg Q6H x2 doses, but were unable to break his rapid
Afib. His BP was as low as 89/76 and his HR was as high as 170.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS: 98.2  84  95/60  17
95%/RA.

CXR [**2146-9-15**]:
FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 The heart is of top normal size with stable cardiomediastinal
contours.  The right lung base linear opacity is similar to
multiple prior examinations, compatible with chronic mucoid
impaction.  Known right lower lobe nodule is not clearly
visualized on this exam.  Small right pleural effusion is
present, similar to prior.  No radiopaque foreign body.
Multilevel thoracic spine degenerative changes.

IMPRESSION:  Right lower lung linear opacity, similar to prior
and likely
reflects chronic mucoid impaction.  Small right pleural effusion
is also
similar to prior.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, AFib, squamous
cell lung cancer on adjuvant chemo C1D15 on day of discharge,
cis/docetaxel who presented with febrile neutropenia, Afib with
RVR, and hypotension.
.
At time of discharge, pt was clinically stable with resolution
of neutropenia. He had a dose of Neulasta at time of admission.
He remains in sinus rhythm, with adjustments to his medications
this admission. Other details below:
.
# Afib with RVR:
- The patient has a history of Afib s/p DCCV in [**5-/2146**] and is on
disopyramide for rhythm control and metoprolol for rate control.
Fever and neutropenia likely precipitating factors. Metoprolol
has been held. Dig loaded initially. No role for cardioversion
unless pt is hemodynamcially unstable.
- Med changes per discussion with cardiology:
 - [**9-18**] - stopped digoxin 0.25mg daily. Metoprolol changed to
long acting 50 mg po daily. Stopped heparin gtt and started back
on outpt [**Month/Year (2) **].
 - Change to longacting diltiazem.
- Continue disopyramide. (see discharge meds for regimen) In
sinus rhythm with this regimen.
- telemetry; reviewed EKG with cardiology, who reports no acute
issues with EKG findings.
.
# Hypotension: resolved with IVF and rate control; maybe
associated with infection.
.
# Febrile neutropenia: Resolved [**2146-9-17**].
- [**2146-9-18**] WBC 19, leukocytosis now - Patient received outpt
Neulasta on [**2146-9-15**].
- Likely urinary source with e coli (essentially pan-sensitive)
in urine. Blood cultures no growth to date. Patient has had ANC
of 112 initially.
- Had cefepime 2g q8h  (started [**2146-9-16**], had 5 day course); Will
change to cefpodoxime to continue additional 3 days of therapy.
 - vancomycin started [**9-16**], stopped [**9-19**] to tailor therapy.
- unlikely cxr findings are PNA. Post VATS CXR shows RLL field
opacity, likely associated with resection. Exam has been normal
thus far. Monitor closely.
.
# Hyponatremia: Resolved due to hypovolemia.
.
# Squamous cell lung cancer: Cycle 1 of adjuvant chemo. When
stable will start C2 in [**1-24**] weeks as outpatient.
.
# Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Stable. Followed cards recs.
.
# Hyperlipidemia
- continue pravastatin

Patient will follow up with oncology and cardiology as
instructed.
