Brief Hospital Course:
COURSE: Briefly, this is a 79yoM presenting after presumed
syncopal episode with sepsis, and was admitted to the intensive
care unit with intubation, monitoring of his hemodynamics,
requiring significant volume resucitaion.  He was treated
empirically for a  pneumonia, with resolution of elevated white
count and fever.  No other source of sepsis was found.  He had a
cardiac workup, which did not reveal a source for the syncope.
He persisted with encephalopathy up to the time of discharge,
oriented and alert, but not quite at baseline per family.  THis
is most likely related to toxic / metabolic effects of profound
sepsis / illness, and repeat head CTs have been unrevealing.  He
was in acute renal failure on admission, which responded to
volume. Part of his encephalopthy presumably relates to his
persistent swallowing / speech dysfunction, with no neurological
focus found.  He was fed through an NG tube and eventually had a
PEG tube placed for feeds. persists
.
Encephalopathy: Persists, with actually some improvement in MS.
[**Name13 (STitle) **] told me (when asked) that he preferred to see the nurse in
the AM, and not me (joking), but remains minimally verbal with
flat affect.  Not sure etiology.  Could not get MRI b/c pacer.
Wanted to get CT with contrast to evaluate for stroke changes /
cause of encephalopathy, but CT was done without contrast (no
new bleed / changes).  Family meeting yesterday revealed that he
may be closer to his baseline than we previously presumed.  The
meeting was good, and they decided to pursue a PEG tube to get
him to a nursing rehab facitlity closer to home so that he can
get more visitors with hopes that he can recover his swallow
function with rehab. His mental status remained unchanged over
the last week to ten days of his admission.
.
Sepsis: On presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU pt with hypotension,
elevated lactate which peaked at 6, SIRS with evidence of end
organ damage given acute renal failure (Creatinine peak at 1.9).
Etiology likely RLL pneumonia c aspiration possible given pt's
AMS and h/o emesis on presentation. Pt was initially febrile to
103, Since admission pt afebrile x 15 days, lactate improved, BP
better (hypertensive now). WBC now trended downwards and has
remained within our labs normal range for one week.
Leukocytosis likely [**12-20**] steroids.
His blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures had no
growth.  He was given empiric antibiotics for a 7 day course
(vanco, meropenem) without an obvious source, a presumed
pneumonia.  He defervesced and remained stable.  He also
completed a course of fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone, as
well as xigris.  He showed now signs of adrenal insufficiency
upon discharge.

.
Hemodynamics- Hypotensive c SBPs in 70-80s on presentation.
Given over 23L of IVF (mostly LR). CVPs better and BP now high c
MAPs in high 75s. HTN not resolving c extubation and decreasing
agitation. Therefore, treating more aggressively c anti-HTN
