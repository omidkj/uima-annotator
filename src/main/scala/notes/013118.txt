History of Present Illness:
73 yoF w/ h/o HTN, hyperchol, and prior TIAS initially presented
to ED [**2182-3-6**] following episode of sudden onset transient
slurred speech and paresthesias of lip (sbp at home 190s). In
[**Name (NI) **], pt evaluated by neuro, had MRI (-) for acute stroke. [**2182-3-7**]
a.m., pt had episode of N/V followed by tachypnea and increased
work of breathing. Received lasix 40 mg IV X 1, nitro gtt and
was placed on BiPAP for suspected CHF. However, sbp decreased to

intubated, started on levophed and gtt. CTA (-) for PE, showing
diffuse ground glass opacities and bibasilar opacities (c/w

MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST ([**2182-3-6**])
FINDINGS: There is no area of restricted diffusion. Again noted
are multiple foci and confluent areas of T2 hyperintensity in
the periventricular and deep white matter of the cerebral
hemispheres which have increased in the interval. There is
convex margin of the superior aspect of the pituitary gland and
mild glandular enlargement, which is not significantly changed
compared to prior examination. There is no mass effect, shift of
the normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute infarct.
2. Progression of patient's known chronic small vessel ischemic
infarcts.
3. Unchanged pituitary gland enlargement, compatible with a
small tumor.
HEAD MRA: 3D time of flight imaging of the anterior and
posterior cerebral circulations was obtained. Comparison was
made to prior study dated [**2181-7-29**].
FINDINGS: There is no hemodynamically significant stenosis or
aneurysmal dilatation of the visualized vasculature.
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable head MRA.

CHEST (PA & LAT) ([**2182-3-6**]):
FINDINGS:
The heart is normal in size. The aorta is slightly tortuous and
unfolded. The lungs appear clear. There is no pleural effusion.
Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. There is no
pneumothorax. Biapical pleural scarring is unchanged. A clip is
seen medially in the superior mediastinum along the left
paratracheal margin. The osseous structures demonstrate mild
degenerative changes throughout the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:
No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. No
CHF.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Echo ([**3-8**]):
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Small LV cavity.
Hyperdynamic LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve
leaflets. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of
papillary muscles. Trivial MR. Prolonged (>250ms) transmitral
E-wave decel time. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Mild PA
systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
Left pleural
effusion.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is small. Left ventricular
systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial
effusion.

CT abdomen and pelvis ([**3-10**]):
FINDINGS: Evaluation of the lung bases demonstrates bilateral
pleural effusions and atelectasis. This is less severe than on a
prior examination although the entire lungs are not evaluated on
today's exam.
The liver and spleen are unremarkable. A calcified stone and
sludge are identified within the gallbladder. There is no
evidence of intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The
pancreas is slightly fatty replaced, but otherwise unremarkable.
No adrenal lesions are present. There is a 4.6 cm exophytic cyst
in the left kidney. No other renal masses are identified. The
kidneys enhance symmetrically and are without evidence of
perinephric stranding or hydronephrosis. There are no dilated
loops of small bowel to suggest an obstruction. Contrast is
visualized throughout the distal bowel and colon. Scattered left
sided and sigmoid diverticula are present without evidence of
diverticulitis. No significant lymphadenopathy is present. Note
is made of atherosclerotic calcifications and a clacified
splenic artery aneurysm.
Evaluation of the deep pelvis is slightly limited due to
artifact from the indwelling bilateral hip arthroplasties. No
discrete fluid collection is identified. The bladder is
collapsed with a Foley catheter within it.
Evaluation of the bone windows demonstrates no osseous blastic
or lytic lesions. Degenerative changes are present throughout
the spine. An area of soft tissue density is identified with in
the atrophied left paraspinous muscles of L5-S1. This is better
evaluated on the prior CT and MRI of the lumbar spine. It is
nonspecific and may represent post-surgical changes.
IMPRESSION:
Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
No intra-abdominal fluid collections are identified to suggest
an abscess. Evaluation of the deep pelvis is slightly limited as
described above.

Carotid US ([**3-12**]):
HISTORY: TIA.
There is no appreciable plaque or wall thickening involving
either carotid system. The peak systolic velocities bilaterally
are normal, as are the ICA to CCA ratios. There is normal
antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
IMPRESSION:
Widely patent common and internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
