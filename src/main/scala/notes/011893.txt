Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13159**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2166-10-13**] Left craniotomy evacuation of left subdural hematoma
[**2166-10-27**] Left burr holes and evacuation of subdural hematoma

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman who presented to the ED at
[**Hospital1 18**] with altered mental status. Per family the patient has
become increasingly confused and weak since yesterday. She awoke
yesterday unable to answer questions and appeared to have word
finding difficulties. Her mental status waxed and waned as the
day progressed per the patients daughter. Today her mental
status
worsened and she was unable to assist in her activities of daily
living as she normally would. She presented to the ED for
evaluation due to these symptoms and as part of her workup a CT
head was done which showed a 2.4cm L SDH and  6mm R SDH with MLS
to the left of 1.1cm as well as subfalcine and uncal herniation.
As a result of this neurosurgery was called to evaluate the
patient.


Past Medical History:
- ASTHMA
- HYPERTENSION
- DIABETES TYPE II (NIDDM)
- HYPONATREMIA
- STROKE, happened in [**Country **] in [**2164**] - unclear where or what
deficits were noted. On plavix so presumable ischemic.
- ABDOMINAL PAIN
chronic, most likely multifactorial. Chronic constipation, for
which she takes colace and senna, and aerophagia for which she
takes simethicone. Had cholecystectomy [**12-17**] after she was noted
to have gallstones on u/s and elevated amylase. Colonoscopy [**3-17**]
showed polyps in the sigmoid colon (polypectomy) and grade 2
internal hemorrhoids. EGD [**12-17**] showed medium hiatal hernia and
atrophic gastritis.
- SYPHILIS [**2161-3-5**] s/p 2 doses of penicillin
- s/p lap chole on [**2156-12-20**]

daughter (lives with daugther and 2 grandkids). Patient denies
any tobacco, no EtOH, no drugs.


Family History:
no FHx of Ca especially gastric/abdominal ca, patient denies any

history of HTN, no CVA/CAD, Grandaugther w/ DM1 since 9 y.o.

Pertinent Results:
[**10-13**] [**Month/Year (2) **]: IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.

[**10-13**] NCHCT: 1.  New acute-on-subacute 2.4 cm left subdural
hematoma, with marked compression of the left cerebral
hemisphere, 1.5 cm rightward subfalcine herniation, and left
uncal herniation.
2. Chronic 6-mm right subdural hematoma, without significant
mass effect.

[**10-13**] NCHCT: IMPRESSION:  Interval evacuation of left subdural
hemorrhage with decrease in size of the left subdural hematoma,
decreased rightward shift of normally midline structures, and
persistent but decreased mass effect on the left lateral
ventricle and sulci of the left cerebral convexity.

[**10-14**] NCHCT: 1.  Unchanged size of a left frontal subdural
hematoma compared with recent prior examination.  Stable mass
effect and shift of the usually midline structures 5 mm to the
right.  No transtentorial herniation. 2.  Evaluation for new
hemorrhage, infarct or skull base abnormality is extremely
limited due to patient motion during the examination.

[**2166-10-16**] NCHCT:  1. Since initial evaluation of subdural hematoma
on [**2166-10-13**], interval improvement is noted. However,
there is persistent subdural fluid collection with residual
pneumocephalus.

2. Hypodense area in the left frontal lobe, which is more
conspicuous in
today's study possibly consistent with vasogenic edema but of
uncertain origin for which close follow up is advised.

[**10-16**] [**Month/Day (4) **] -  there is slight blunting of the
right costophrenic angle.  This could reflect a tiny pleural
effusion or
merely be a manifestation of the AP rather than PA technique.

[**10-18**] [**Month/Day (4) **] - New peribronchial opacification at the right lung
base could be pneumonia.  Lungs are otherwise clear and there is
minimal if
any pleural effusion.

[**10-19**] [**Month/Day (4) **] - Finding at the right lung base can be explained by
atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusion.  Pneumonia
cannot be excluded, but there do not appear to have been any
progressive changes in the appearance of the right lung base.

[**10-21**] CT head 1. Interval enlargement of the left subdural
collection, without evidence of an increase in acute blood
products. Increased rightward shift of midline structures and
increased compression of third ventricle. 2. Persistent left
anterior frontal edema.

[**2166-10-23**]: Chest X-ray:
Right lower lobe consolidation appears to be unchanged.  Left
mid lung opacity and lower lobe opacity are grossly unchanged as
well, might be consistent with aspiration pneumonia giving their
persistence since [**2166-10-19**].  Upper lungs are essentially
clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.

[**2166-10-27**]: Chest X-ray:
1.  New ET tube is in adequate position.
2.  Bibasilar opacities are unchanged since [**2166-10-23**].

[**2166-10-27**]: Post-operative Non-contrast Head CT:
1. Removal of most of the left subdural hematoma with expected
postoperative changes.
2. Improved but continued shift of normally midline structures
to the right.

[**2166-10-29**]: Non-contrast Head CT:
1. Residual left subdural fluid collection with decreased
residual
pneumocephalus. No new hemorrhage.
2. Improved but persistent rightward shift of midline
structures.

[**Month/Day/Year **] [**2166-11-1**] PA/Lat: There are low lung volumes.  There is a
stable mild cardiomegaly.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions,
right greater than left with adjacent atelectasis have minimally
improved from prior.  Vascular congestion has resolved.  Right
PICC is in standard position.  There is no pneumothorax.

[**Month/Day/Year **] portable [**2166-11-5**]: CONCLUSION: *Preliminary Report*
1. Moderate pulmonary edema is new.
2. Right moderate pleural effusion and small left pleural
effusion has increased.
3. Bibasilar consolidation is probably atelectasis; however,
superimposed aspiration or infection cannot be excluded in
appropriate clinical setting.
