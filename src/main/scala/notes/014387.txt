Studies:
[**2187-3-8**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Right perihilar increased interstitial
markings consistent with interstitial pneumonia given the
clinical history.
.
[**2187-3-9**] CXR (AP port): FINDINGS: In comparison with study of
[**3-8**], there is persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
with further increase in the interstitial pulmonary markings.
More coalescent areas are seen in the upper lung zones, raising
the
possibility of focal areas of pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo W with PNH complicated by persistent
pancytopenia who initially presented with fevers and hypoxia,
strep viridans positive blood cultures, Klebsiella UTI and chest
imaging concerning for atypical/interstitial pulmonary
infection.  Her course was complicated by worsening respiratory
distress following bronchoscopy and platelet transfusion, with
likely transfusion reaction.

1)Neutropenia, fever, dyspnea, hypoxia: She had persistant
fevers throughout the first week of her admission concerning for
infectious process most likely from a pulmonary source.
History, exam, and imaging consistent with atypical/interstitial
pulmonary process.  Her blood cultures from admission had one
set positive for strep viridans and her urine culture was
growing Klebsiella > 100K(pansensitive except for
nitrofurantoin).  All blood and urine cultures since starting
antibiotics were negative.  She had bronchoscopy to attempt to
obtain a culture diagnosis and to evaluate for tuberculosis.
Bacterial cultures from BAL were negative, AFB culture still
pending however the smear was negative so TB precautions were
discontinued.  Post bronchoscopy she had exacerbation of her
reactive ariways with incrased oxygen requirement and poor air
movement.  She was treated with a oxygen by NRB and albuterol
and ipratropium nebulizers.  In addition, she developed
respiratory distress following platelet transfusion consistent
with acute tranfsuion reaction and was transferred to the
intensive care unit.  Her respiratory status slowly improved
over the next several day with diuresis and she returned to the
floor and remained stable from a respiratory standpoint
throughout the rest of her hospitalization.  She was discharged
to a nursing facility to complete a 14 day course of cefepime,
azithromycin, and vancomycin given neutropenia, last day of
antibiotics should be [**3-28**].  At the time of discharge she was
breathing comfortably, still with oxygen requirement of 3L by
nasal cannula.

2)Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria: Eculizumab held
throughout admission and on discharge in light of fevers.  She
became progressively pancytopenic during her admission most
likely due to acute illness vs. MDS transformation of her bone
marrow.  Her granulocyte count reached a low point of 50 during
her admission and trended back up to 580 prior to discharge.
She was transfused a total of 4 units of PRBC to maintain a
hematocrit >18 and 2 units of platelets for platelet count <10.
Her second PLT transfusion was complicated by likely an acute
transfusion reaction characterized by acute respiratory
distress, rigors and fever requiring MICU transfer.  By the time
of discharge her granulocytes were slowly trending up, and were
580 on last check.  After extensive conversation with Mrs.
[**Known lastname **] she decided that she no longer wished to have
transfusions given that she most likely would be transfusion
dependent.  She understood and accepted the risks of not being
transfused PRBC and Platelets and opted to no longer have
routine lab draws.  As she was competent and understood the
risks and options, this was respected and labs draws were
stopped.  She was continued on danazol, folic acid and
cyanocobalamin on discharge.  She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1852**] in oncology clinic two weeks after discharge.
 She should not have routine blood work at her nursing facility.

3) HTN: Stable throughout her admission.  She was continued on
her outpatient regimen of norvasc and lasix.

4)Diabetes mellitus: She has a history of brittle diabetes,
complicated by retinopathy and nephropathy.  She had been having
symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes in the early morning so her PM
dose of 70/30 was decreased from 15 to 10 units.  Her morning
dose was continued at 10 units.  She may require up titration of
her evening insulin dose as she recovers from her acute illness
and her appetite improves.  She was also treated with humalog
sliding scale.

5)CRF: creatinine at baseline of 1.9-2.0.  Her medications were
renally-dosed.

6) PPX: thrombocytopenia - no SQH or pneumoboots, defer PPI
given risk of BM suppression, bowel reg.

7)FEN: reg diet, monitor lytes

8)Code: DNR/DNI, she no longer wants transfusions or routine
blood draws
