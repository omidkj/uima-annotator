History of Present Illness:
59 year old woman s/p MV replacement (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical), TVR
([**Doctor Last Name **] ring) and ASD [**2199-7-10**] with postoperative Atrial
fibrillation presenting with melena for 1 day. She noticed that
her stool this morning was soft but black. She had four similar
stools today. She went to her PCP who sent her in to ED for
evaluation. She denies recent nausea, vomiting, or BRBPR. She
had a similar episode in [**2197**], but otherwise has not had recent
bleeding. She was started on a ten day course of augmentin for
ear pain two weeks ago and was started on amiodorone for atrial
fibrillation on [**12-25**]. Two days ago she had transient
orthostasis, but otherwise has not had pre-syncope or
lightheadedness.

In the ED, initial VS: HR 89 BP 135/66. She compained of SOB and
weakness and ST depressions and was consented via interpreter
for transfusion. She had guiac positive black stools. An NG
lavage was negative for blood. Her Hct was 27.3, from a baseline
27-29%, but per her PCP's last record, her Hct was 34. She was
given 2L IVF and 1U PRBC en route to the ICU. Prior to transfer,
her VS: 98.3 76 111/55 16 100/RA.

Discharge Labs:

Radiology:
CXR [**1-6**]
There is no evidence of free air. Severe cardiomegaly is
unchanged. Sternal wires are aligned. Right IJ catheter tip is
in the lower SVC. Bilateral pleural effusions are small. New
opacities in the left upper lobe are worrisome for aspiration.
There is no pneumothorax.

CXR [**1-8**]
Interval resolution of a previously seen left upper lobe
opacity,
compatible with resolved aspiration pneumonitis given the rapid
time course.

EGD Reports:
[**1-4**]
Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach: Protruding Lesions A fungating and ulcerated
non-bleeding 2-3 cm mass of malignant appearance was found at
the antrum. The scope traversed the lesion. A fungating and
ulcerated 1 cm mass with stigmata of recent bleeding of
malignant appearance was found at the antrum. The scope
traversed the lesion. Duodenum: Normal duodenum. Impression:
Mass in the antrum. Mass in the antrum. Otherwise normal EGD to
third part of the duodenum

[**1-6**] (EUS):
EUS
findings: EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at 7.5
MHz frequency: The polyps were first identified endoscopically
in the antrum and then imaged with EUS. The larger polyp
measured 1.2 cm X 1.0 cm. Shape of the polyp was round.
Echotecture of the polyp was hypoechoic and homogenous. The
polyp appeared to arise from the superficial layer [EUS layers 1
and 2]. An intact submucosal layer ahd muscularis [layers 3 and
4] was noted along the entire lesion. No adjacent lymph
adenopathy was found.  No peri-gastric ascites was noted.
Impression: 2 polyps seen in the antrum - endoscopic appearance
was suggestive of hyperplastic/inflammatory polyps EUS:  The
polyps appeared to arise from the superficial gastric layers.

12/23
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:  Protruding Lesions Two polyps were found in the
antrum. The larger polyp had a stalk and measured about 20mm.
There was a ulceration at the tip of the polyp. The smaller
polyp measured about 8mm. There was no active bleeding.A
single-piece polypectomy was performed using a hot snare and
both the polyps were removed. The polyps were retrived using a
[**Doctor Last Name **] net and sent for pathology.  2 clips were applied at the
site of the smaller polyps to prevent post-polypectomy bleed.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum. Impression: Two polyps were found in
the antrum. The larger polyp had a stalk and measured about
20mm. There was a ulceration at the tip of the polyp. The
smaller polyp measured about 8mm. There was no active bleeding.
A single-piece polypectomy was performed using a hot snare and
both the polyps were removed. The polyps were retrived using a
[**Doctor Last Name **] net and sent for pathology. 2 clips were applied at the
site of the smaller polyps to prevent post-polypectomy bleed.

Colonoscopy: [**1-9**]
Findings:  Protruding Lesions Small non-bleeding grade 1
internal hemorrhoids were noted.  Impression: Grade 1 internal
hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
Recommendations: Sugarless metamucil [**1-18**] teaspoons daily in
glass of water
High Fiber DietColonoscopy in 10 years as per the recommendation
of Medicare.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 year old woman with mechanical St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mitral valve,
tricuspid valve replacement ([**Doctor First Name 7624**] ring), atrial fibrillation
on coumadin and aspirin presenting with melana in the setting of
a supratherapeutic INR and new diagnosis of antral gastric
polyps.

Hospital Course by Problem:

# GI Bleed: Patient with upper GI bleed in the setting of a
supratherapeutic INR, recent weight loss, and chronic iron
deficiency anemia.  She was initially admitted to the Medical
ICU for close monitoring of her hematocrit. 4 U of packed red
blood cells was required during admission from [**Date range (1) 5197**].
Serial hematocrits were checked, and hematocrit remained stable
at 32-34. Patient had central line placed for access, which was
removed once her hematocrit remained stable. She was
subsequently called out to the medical floor: EGD and EUS
revealed 2 antral gastric polyps removed via endoscopic
polypetomy. Colonoscopy only significant for grade I hemorroids.
Pathology of polyps showed granulation tissue and inflammation,
but no evidence of adenocarcinoma. Surgery recommended no
surgery at this time. Patient should no longer take any
ibuprofen or aspirin. Her hematocrit remained stable  (38-40)
for latter five days of her hospitalization.

# Anticoagulation: Patient has significant stroke risk given
mechanical mitral valve and atrial fibrillation. Goal INR
2.5-3.5 but wanted reversible anticoagulation for required
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Due to
