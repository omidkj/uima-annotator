History of Present Illness:
HPI: 60 yo man with hx of IDDM with diabetic neuropathy, chronic
renal failure, bilateral foot ulcers, heart failure with
implanted defibrillator, atrial flutter on coumadin, and
peripheral vascular disease s/p right leg bypass, who presented
to ED today with a one week history of dizziness and mild
headache. Pt states he noted the onset of room spinning when he
stood up but it would resolve when he sat back down; it was
associated with tinnitus but no nausea/vomiting or hearing loss.
He notes that this am he may have fallen towards the left. He
also noted a mild persistent frontal headache, no neck
stiffness, fever, chills. On the morning of admission, pt woke
up and stood to walk to the bathroom and could barely make it
due to severe vertigo, again, no nausea. He came to the ED and
it was found that his INR was 16 and he had a small SAH on head
CT. Of note, pt states that he tripped over the vacuum cord 3
weeks ago and hit his left hip and elbow, cannot remember if he
hit his head, no LOC. Neurology and neurosurgery evaluated the
pt in the ED and given his multiple medical problems, he was
admitted to the MICU for close monitoring. He received 4units of
FFP, and 10mg po vitamin K.

IMPRESSION:
Loss of the visualization of the cortical bone of the base of
the 5th metatarsal and of the lateral aspect of the cuboid. This
is concerning for osteomyelitis. Correlate with site of ulcer.
Bone scan could be performed.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

IMPRESSION:
Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage seen superiorly in a
right frontal sulcus.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2201-7-27**] 10:40 AM
COMPARISON: [**2201-7-26**].
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of small subarachnoid hemorrhage
in a right frontal lobe sulcus

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2201-7-26**] 3:22 PM
Reason: eval for infiltrate

IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of acute pneumonia.
Postoperative changes in the right hemithorax with stable
fibrothorax. An addendum will be dictated when more recent films
become available.

ADDENDUM: There is no significant change since the prior CXR of
[**2200-9-4**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

ECG: AV paced at 60; no st-t changes

Brief Hospital Course:
60y/o M with h/o a flutter on coumadin, CHF s/p ICD, DM type 2,
who presents with one week of dizziness, headache and found to
have a small post frontal bleed in setting of supratherapeutic
inr 16.

1. Post frontal bleed:
Spontaneous bleed in setting of supratherapeutic INR of 16,
patient denied any recent trauma prior to arrivel though did
attest to having fallen ~3 weeks ago. Per neuro findings were
c/w new/recent bleed, they said that if bleed would have
happened 3 weeks ago the composition of the blood would have
changed and not lit up as it did on CT scans. Inr was reveresed
with 4U FFP and 10mg vitamin K. Inr dropped to 2's within 8
hours of admission. Per neuro no focal neurological defects on
exam. His repeat CT was unchanged and did not show progression
of bleed. His headaches and dizziness resolved. CTA was not
performed due to his CRI with creatinines at mid 3's and MRI/MRA
not done due to his ICD. Neurosurgery s/o and recommended f/u as
outpatient in their clinic in 2 weeks with CT s contrast prior
to visit. Neuro also signed off without furhter recommendations.


2. Coagulopathy: unclear as to why patient presented with
elevated INR of 16, no change in diet, no change in medications,
could have been antibiotics but patient had been off them some
time. Possibly poor nutrition as both PT and PTT corrected with
vit K doses x 2. After reversal patients coags remained stable
and within normal. He was not restarted on his coumadin and we
recommended that he be started as an outpatient by pcp.

3. Leukocytosis: unclear etiology, no focal signs of infection,
chest x ray was clear, ua was normal, no si/sx's of infection,
his left heel ulcer appeared normal with no evidence of puss,
erythema, tenderness. Pt was afebrile thoughout stay and abx
were not started. Prior to discharge patients white count began
to decrease. No further w/u was done.

4. Acute on CRF: [**2-25**] prerenal/hypovolemia. Improved with
hydration. Stable.

5. Foot ulcers:
X ray was taken of left foot ulcer and showed cortical erosion
of the 5th metatarsal but did not correlate with location of
ulcer. Podiatry was consulted and said that changes that were
seen on the X ray are [**2-25**] his severe deformities and not due to
osteomyelitis. They recommended wet to dry dressings and daily
dressing changes.

6. DM2: glucoses remained stable, continued on his outpatient
medication regimen.

7. HTN: stable, continued on his outpatient med regimen

8. Cardiac: CHF: euvolemic, salt and fluid restricted, continued
on heart failure meds.
CAD: continued on bb and asa
Rhythm: a fib, stopped coumadin and reversed inr. Did not
restart coumadin due to CNS bleed, will have pcp restart as
outpatient. Restarted amiodarone.

9. Gout: stable, c/w allopurinol.

10.  Depression: c/w fluoxetine

11. Hypercholesterolemia: c/w lovastatin and welchol.
