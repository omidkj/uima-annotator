Physical Exam:
At the time of discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 71106**] was in no acute distress.
He was awake, alert, and oriented times three and had good
strength bilaterally in both upper and lower extremities.  He
was found to have expressive aphasia.  His lungs revealed course
rhonchi throughout, and auscultation of his heart revealed and
S1-S2 although it was of regular rate and rhythm.  Eamination of
his sternal incision revealed no drainage or erythema and his
abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended.  His
extremities were warm and 2+ edema was noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71106**] was admitted on [**2114-6-11**] to [**Hospital1 827**] for heparin therapy given his mechanical aortic
valve while his INR drifted down.  He was seen in consultation
by the rheumatology service.

On [**2114-6-19**] he was taken the the operating room and underwent a
redo, redo sternotomy with axillary and femoral artery
exploration and cannulation, repair of ascending aorta and arch
with 36 mm gelweave graft, ascending aorta to innominate artery
bypass, ascending aorta to carotid artery bypass (reimplantation
of the great vessels) 12x6mm hemashield graft, reconstruction of
the pulmonary artery, aortic valve replacement (25mm OnX
conformex valve).  This procedure was performed by Drs.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 22423**].  Please see the operative note for
details.  He tolerated the procedure well and was able to be
transferred in critical but stable condition to the surgical
intensive care unit.

Upon waking in the intensive care unit, Mr. [**Known lastname 71106**] was found to
have diminished strength in his right arm.  With extubation he
was noted to have expressive aphasia and was therefore seen in
consultation by the neurology service.  A subsequent head CT
revealed a left MCA stroke.  A dobhoff was placed and tube feeds
were started.

On [**2114-6-26**] Mr. [**Known lastname 71106**] was taken to the operating room and
underwent a descending aortic stent graft with vascular surgery.
 He tolerated this procedure well and was transferred in stable
condition back to the intensive care unit.  He was seen in
consultation by the ENT service, who found that his vocal cord
function was normal.  He was seen by the speech and swallow
service and it was recommended that he maintain NPO secondary to
oral and pharyngeal delay.  His lumbar drain and epicardial
wires were removed.  He was found to have gone into atrial
fibrillation, for which he was placed on amiodarone.  On
post-operative day nine, he was transferred to the surgical step
down floor.

On the step down floor Mr. [**Known lastname 71106**] was seen in consultation by the
physical therapy service.  Speech and swallow cleared him to
start advancing his diet.  Coumadin therapy was begun. On [**7-5**] it
was decided Mr [**Known lastname 71106**] was stable and ready to be discharged to
rehabilitation at Seton/[**Hospital3 245**] in [**Location 41129**],ME.
