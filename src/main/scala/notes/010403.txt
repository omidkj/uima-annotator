Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83-year-old male
who was transferred from an outside facility to [**Hospital6 1760**] after falling face-first down
an escalator.  The patient reportedly lost consciousness at
the scene and sustained multiple facial lacerations.  Initial
CT scan of the head at the outside facility revealed evidence
of intracranial hemorrhage, at which time the patient was
transferred to this facility.

On presentation to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient was noted to
have a GCS of 15, complained of right hand and right knee
pain, as well as right-sided face pain.  Per report, the
patient remained hemodynamically stable both during his stay
at the outside facility and during transport to [**Hospital3 **].

EXTREMITIES:  Right upper extremity with distal forearm
deformity.  Minimal cyanosis right first phalanx.  Right
lower extremity superficial abrasion to right knee and right
shin.  Pulses 2+ bilateral upper and lower distal
extremities.

LABORATORY:  CBC - white count 12.3, hematocrit 34, platelets
173.  Chemistries within normal limits.  Coags significant
for INR 1.1, lactate 1.4.

RADIOLOGY:  CT of the head - bilateral frontal and parietal
subarachnoid hemorrhage, small left posterior parietal
subdural hemorrhage.  CT of the C-spine negative.  Right
wrist with intra-articular distal radius fracture and
intra-articular first phalanx fracture.  CT of the face with
fine cuts - right orbital fracture of inferior and lateral
orbital walls, medial wall of the right maxillary sinus
fracture.  Chest x-ray - right second rib fracture.  Right
knee, tibia and fibula - no evidence of fracture.  AP pelvis
- negative.  [**3-18**] CT of the head - without change.
Thoracolumbar spine series - significant only for slight disk
narrowing at L5-S1 and L3-L4, without evidence of acute
fracture.  MRI of the C-spine - spondylosis without evidence
of acute injury.  [**3-21**] CT of the head - without significant
change.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was evaluated and stabilized in
the trauma bay at [**Hospital6 256**]
Emergency Department and then transported to radiology for
the above mentioned radiographic studies.  The patient then
returned to the Emergency Department and was noted to be
hemodynamically stable throughout his course, yet was
transferred to the T-SICU for frequent neurologic assessment
and hemodynamic monitoring.

Given the above mentioned findings on CT of the head, the
neurosurgery service was asked to consult on the patient in
the Emergency Department.  The patient was then placed on q 1
h neuro checks, and a systolic blood pressure of less than
140 was maintained via arterial line monitoring.
Additionally, Dilantin was loaded intravenously, and the
patient's serum sodium was monitored, all per the
recommendations of the neurosurgery service.  Repeat CT scans
of the head on hospital day #2 and #5, respectively, were
without significant.

Given the patient's right orbital fractures without evidence
of clinical or radiographic entrapment, both the
ophthalmology and plastic surgery services were asked to
evaluate the patient in the Emergency Department.  The
plastic surgery service determined that the nature of the
fractures was nonoperative and wished to follow-up with the
patient in the outpatient setting, as described below.  The
ophthalmology consultation service found no evidence of
retinal detachment, or visual deficit, and recommended cool
compresses for 48 hours, sinus precautions, and follow-up
with ophthalmology as an outpatient.

Given the patient's obvious right distal forearm fracture and
radiographically proven right thumb fracture, the orthopedic
service was asked to evaluate the patient while in the
Emergency Department.  The orthopedic service felt that the
nature of the fractures were unlikely to require operative
repair, and recommended splinting of the injury with a thumb
spica cast, elevation of the affected extremity,
nonweightbearing status of the right upper extremity, and
follow-up as an outpatient with orthopedic.

After the patient's admission to the T-SICU, the patient's
course was notable only for confusion and intermittent bouts
of lethargy, without evidence of hemodynamic instability, or
worsening hemorrhage on repeat head CT.  The patient was
transferred to the general surgical floor on hospital day #3,
given the hemodynamic stability and the stable neurologic
exam.  The neurosurgery service at that time decided that
there was no further indication for potential surgical
intervention and requested to see the patient as an
outpatient with repeat output CT scan of the head.

On hospital day #4, the patient was found to have episodes of
decreasing responsiveness, at which time he remained
hemodynamically stable with normal fingerstick blood glucose,
an unremarkable EKG, normal chest x-ray, normal urinalysis,
and normal arterial blood gas values.  Given the patient's
known intracerebral hemorrhage, a repeat head CT was
performed on hospital day #4, which showed no further
evolution from prior scans.  Subsequently, the patient's
mental status began to improve to levels of alertness
previously experienced during the hospitalization.

On hospital day #6, a bedside swallowing evaluation was
performed that found the patient able to tolerate a regular
diet with 1:1 assistance.  Additionally, both physical
therapy and occupational therapy evaluated the patient and
found him in need of acute level of rehab.  On hospital day
#7, a nutrition consult was obtained secondary to decreased
PO intake.  Recommendations were made for nutritional
supplementation, calorie counting, and 1:1 assistance with
feeds.  At this time, a discussion was had with the family
and the healthcare proxy regarding potential placement of a
temporary nasogastric feeding tube.  The family was adamantly
opposed to this and committed to assisted feedings with
nutritional supplementation.
