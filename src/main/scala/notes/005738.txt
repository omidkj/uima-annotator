Service:  Medicine [**Hospital1 203**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old
female with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive
heart failure, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease
and gastroesophageal reflux disease who presented to the
Emergency Department with mental status changes with
subsequent hypotension and was transferred to Medical
Intensive Care Unit team for further management.  The patient
was recently admitted on [**11-27**] for evaluation of a
right lower extremity pain, found to have a fracture and was
placed in a cast.  The patient was well until the day of
admission when she complained of increased leg pain treated
with oxycodone overnight.  The patient was seen by her
primary medical doctor at 11:30 a.m. on the day of admission.
At that time, she was alert, oriented and only complained of
leg pain.  The patient was treated with OxyContin at 9 a.m.
and took some Benadryl for a rash which was presumably from
clindamycin.  At 12:45 p.m., the patient was noted to be
unresponsive with a blood pressure of 60/40, pulse 62 and
respirations of 18.  She was diaphoretic.  At the time, she
was treated with Narcan and oxygen via face mask.  She was
able to answer questions, but remained lethargic.  She was
transferred to the Emergency Department.  In the Emergency
Department, the patient's blood pressure was 66/35, pulse was
80 and she was 91% on 4 liters nasal cannula when she
arrived.  She was given ................ with ineffective
increased agitation.  She was also given a dose of
levofloxacin, Flagyl as well as normal saline.  The patient's
blood pressure rose to the 120s/50s.  The patient had a loose
bowel movement and was guaiac positive.  The patient received
a total of 2.5 liters of normal saline.  She had a right
internal jugular line placed.  She continued to have
decreased blood pressure over the next few hours which was
unresponsive to blood products, was started on a low dose of
dopa, had a CT scan done and was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  On evaluation, the patient complained
only of pain in her .............. and her right foot pain
with palpation.  She denied any chest pain, shortness of
breath or cough.  Denies any recent fevers, chills, abdominal
pain, diarrhea or dysuria.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**Hospital3 2558**].  She
denies any alcohol or tobacco use.  The patient is wheelchair
bound.  Her [**Hospital3 802**] is her healthcare proxy.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 72/27, pulse 90s.  She was 100%
on 6 liters nasal cannula and her respirations were 20.
GENERAL:  She was a chronically ill appearing female in mild
distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Significant for a very
dry oropharynx, but no erythema.  Her neck was supple.  Her
right IJ was in place.  She was normocephalic, atraumatic
with pupils that were equally reactive and responsive to
light.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Her heart sound was distant and she had a
2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  Her jugular venous pressure
was unable to be assessed.
LUNGS:  Diffuse wheezes and crackles at the bases.
ABDOMEN:  Positive bowel sounds, soft, obese, nontender,
nondistended.
EXTREMITIES:  Right leg in a cast, 2+ pulses x4, mildly cool
in the extremities, 1+ edema up to her shin.
SKIN:  Mild macular rash in her back and chest.  Upper
extremity with excoriation.

LABS AND STUDIES:  White count was 10.5.  Her hematocrit was
24. Platelets were 327.  Her PT was 13.7, PTT 39.4, INR 1.3,
albumin 3.4, CK of 58, 81% neutrophils, 0 bands, 6%
lymphocytes and 2% monocytes.  Chem-7:  Sodium 135, potassium
3.8, chloride 90, bicarbonate 32, BUN 48, creatinine 1.9 and
glucose 168.  Her baseline creatinine is 1.5.  Her urinalysis
showed specific gravity of 1.010, 30 protein, small leukocyte
esterase, no nitrites, 0 to 2 red blood cells and 3 t.i.d. 5
white blood cells.  Her electrocardiogram showed normal sinus
rhythm at 60, normal axis, normal intervals, no acute ST
changes.  No Q waves, no sign of right ventricular restraint.
Her chest x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly, resolving
consolidation in the right lower lobe which was a
questionable pneumonia, left small effusion, left basal
atelectasis.  Her echocardiogram in [**2196-7-9**] showed an
ejection fraction of 65%, mild left ventricular hypertrophy,
1+ aortic regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation, at least
mild MS, moderate pulmonary hypertension.

ASSESSMENT:  This is an 86-year-old female who presented to
the Emergency Department with mental status changes, status
post an episode of unresponsiveness and low blood pressure,
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further
evaluation.  Etiology of the patient's hypotension was not
entirely clear.  CT angiogram was not significant for
pulmonary embolus.  Cardiogenic cause was also less likely,
given that the patient had no changes in her
electrocardiogram and had flat serial enzymes and had no
complaints of chest pain.  The chest x-ray also was not
significant for pulmonary edema.  Sepsis was also considered,
however it was also less likely given no fevers, no  elevated
white count and an unimpressive urinalysis.  Hypovolemia was
considered the most likely etiology given her slow response
to fluids earlier in the day.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Cardiology:  The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction with serial enzymes.  She had no ischemic changes
on her electrocardiogram.  The patient had a repeat
echocardiogram done which showed no significant changes from
her prior echocardiogram in [**2196-7-9**].  Current
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 70%, lateral
atrium mildly dilated with mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy.  Her left ventricular cavity size was normal.
Aortic valve was moderately thickened, mild aortic
regurgitation, pulmonary artery, systolic hypertension as
from her previous.  The patient had a history of atrial
fibrillation, but was in normal sinus rhythm.  The patient's
cardiac medications, including diltiazem, metolazone, Lasix,
Isordil were all held given her presentation with low blood
pressure.  Throughout her hospitalization, the patient's
pressure improved gradually.  The patient's cardiac
medications continued to be held throughout her hospital stay
just to ensure that her blood pressure remained stable.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient had an acute need for increased
oxygen requirement although the etiology for this need was
unclear.  Initially, the patient needed 5 liters of oxygen,
but eventually came down with good aspiration and saturations
with 2 liters of nasal cannula.  The patient has a
