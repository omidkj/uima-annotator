History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7962**] is a 68 yo F with PMH of nonischemic cardiomyopathy
(EF 25% on [**2-/2144**]), HTN, mitral valve prolapse, intermittent
LBBB, and atrial fibrillation who has been having progressively
worsening SOB for the last 3 days secondary to CHF exacerbation.
Patient states that she initially noticed SOB approximately 2
weeks ago while she was on vacation in NH.  She attributed this
to humidity.  She does note that she was eating more salt that
usual given dining out.  Also noticed intermittent heart
palpitations.  She went to the ER on [**2144-8-3**] with SOB.  She was
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in consult and given improvement of SOB
after Lasix, advised that she can be discharged home.  Patient
also saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] in clinic on [**8-6**] at which time she was
not SOB, lungs were clear and she did not have any lower
extremity edema.  At that time, several medication changes were
made.  She was started on Coumadin, Metoprolol was discontinued
and she was started instead on Carvedilol 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient
instead self titrated the metoprolol to 50mg daily and had been
taking carvedilol 3.12 daily.
.
On Saturday [**8-8**], she again developed SOB with minimal exertion
and with lying flat.  Breathing better with sitting upright.
Positive PND.  This morning, noticed swelling in her ankles. Has
also had intermittent palpitations.  Denies any chest pain.
lightheadedness.  Although patient states she has never had
symptoms of SOB with exertion, OMR note documents that she
reported some SOB with walking up the stairs in 4/[**2143**].
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 96.8 54 128/85 32 90s%.  Patient
was placed on 3L NC, O2 sats remained stable, no SOB at rest,
some with getting out of bed. Labs and imaging significant for
BNP elevated to [**Numeric Identifier 7963**], INR suptherapeutic at 1.4, Na 129, K 5.4.
 CXR with cardiomegaly with right infrahilar airspace opacity,
looks like pneumonia vs. pulmonary edema. Patient given Lasix
20mg IV x2 at 7am, put out 800cc.Vitals on transfer were 114
AFib occas PVCs, 98.5 temp, 98% 3L NC, RR 16, 110/79.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient feels well.  States SOB has
resolved after treatment with Lasix.  Denies SOB, chest pain,
palpitations, lightheadedness.  No recent fevers/chills.  Does
have a dry cough which is chronic in setting of postnasal drip.
No dysuria.  No recent changes in vision, no dysarthia, no loss
of sensation/motor function.

Imaging
CXR [**2144-8-22**]:

Impression: The current study demonstrates biventricular pacing
devices with the leads most likely located in the right atrium,
right ventricle and the left epicardial vein in expected
location. Cardiomegaly is moderate to severe, unchanged.
Mediastinum is unremarkable. No pneumothorax is seen. Small
amount of pleural effusion is noted most likely on the right.

ECG [**8-11**]: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Left bundle-branch block with a single narrowly conducted QRS
complex. The axis is right inferior. Since previous tracing the
single narrow complex beat is new. Despite a more rapid
ventricular response, the axis is the same. One should verify
that the limb leads were properly placed. Clinical correlation
is suggested.
.
Chest X-ray [**8-11**]:
FINDINGS: The heart size is enlarged, apparently slightly
increased from
prior study, this maybe the magnifying effect of AP projection.
The
mediastinal contours again demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic
disease of the aortic knob. Cephalization of pulmonary
vasculature is accompanied by interstitial edema. The lungs
demonstrate airspace opacity in the right
infrahilar region. Additionally, subtle blunting of the
bilateral
costophrenic angles persist, compatible with small pleural
effusions. Thereis no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with interstitial edema; right
infrahilar airspace
opacity may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, but follow up
radiographs may be helpful to exclude pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7962**] is a 68 yo F with PMH of nonischemic cardiomyopathy
(EF 25% on [**2-/2144**]), HTN, mitral valve prolapse, intermittent
LBBB, and atrial fibrillation who was admitted for progressively
worsening SOB for the over 3 days secondary to CHF exacerbation.

.
# Cardiac arrest: on [**8-18**], patient was successfully cardioverted
to normal sinus rhythem. She was given a dose of dofetilide.
Later that day it was noted that her QTc was elongated from
previously. That evening, she had a cardiac arrest secondary to
torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation. She was
defibrillated after 60 seconds and had ROSC and regained
consciousness. She was briefly transferred to the CCU, where her
magnesium and potassium were repleted and serial EKGs showed
decreasing QTc interval.

# Acute on chronic CHF:  Patient reported history of dyspnea on
exertion, orthopnea, PND and new onset ankle swelling.  Has
known history of CHF with EF 25% in 4/[**2143**]. After receiving
Lasix 40mg IV in the ER, she put out 800cc and dyspnea resolved.
 Initial history and exam consistent with a CHF exacerbation.
[**Month (only) 116**] have baseline worsening EF as she has had such symptoms for
approximately 2 weeks which improved with Lasix.  [**Month (only) 116**] be
secondary to worsening EF in combination with afib with RVR.
Patient's beta blocker was changed on Thursday but she has been
self titrating the medication and not receiving enough beta
blockade.  (Was on Metoprolol XL 100, this was d/c'ed on
Thursday and started on Carvedilol 6.
