20-30 years, none in the last 15 years.  Alcohol:  Heavy use
in the past, none in the last 15 years.  He works as a
retired truck driver.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.1??????, blood
pressure 100/64, pulse 55, respiratory rate 24.  General:
The patient was tachypneic, nontoxic-appearing, mild
jaundiced.  HEENT:  Oropharynx clear.  Mucous membranes very
dry.  JVP not elevated.  Neck:  Supple.  Mildly icteric
sclerae.  Chest:  Bilateral expiratory wheezes.  Coarse
breath sounds bilaterally but no appreciable rales or
rhonchi.  Cardiovascular:  Distant heart sounds.  Normal S1
and S2.  There was a 2 out of 6 systolic murmur.  No rubs or
gallops.  Abdomen:  Obese, distended, soft, exquisitely
tender to palpation of right upper quadrant.  Normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities:  There was [**12-28**]+ bilateral lower
extremity edema.  He had erythematous, scaly, and crusting
lesions on bilateral shins consistent with chronic
venostasis.  Neurological:  The patient was alert and
oriented times three.  No gross motor or sensory deficits.
Rectal:  No stool.  Normal rectal tone.  Guaiac negative.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram was AV paced with rate of
55 beats per minute, T-waves present but not conductive,
consistent with third degree AV block.

On admission white count was 12, hematocrit 42.9, platelet
count 183; sodium 143, potassium 5.1, chloride 102, bicarb
25, BUN 57, creatinine 2.3, glucose 77; bilirubin 4.6,
alkaline phosphatase 195, AST 97, ALT 111.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the General
Medical Service for emergent ERCP.  He went to the ERCP and
was found to have suppurative cholangitis and an impacted
stone in the distal common bile duct which was bolting into
the major pupilla.  He had successful biliary sphincterotomy
and successful stone extraction.

After the procedure, he was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit for respiratory failure, and he was intubated.  In the
Intensive Care Unit, he developed acute renal insufficiency
with creatinine peaking to 4.1.  He also developed
pseudomonal pneumonia, and pseudomonas grew from his biliary
sample.  He had persistently elevated LFTs throughout his
hospitalization and was intermittently pressor dependent for
blood pressure support.  He was treated with broad-spectrum
antibiotics.  He had an ileus for one week postprocedure.  He
was ultimately started on tube feeds which he tolerated at
goal.  He had low-grade DIC which resolved spontaneously.

Ultimately the patient showed no evidence of progressing from
a respiratory status.  A family meeting was held on [**2105-8-24**], to discuss the patient's future course.  At this
time his daughter and son who were present made it clear that
he made his wishes known to not be dependent on a ventilator
for a prolonged period.  The decision was made to withdraw
ventilatory support and concentrate care on his comfort.  The
patient passed away on [**8-25**] at 3:35 a.m. from
respiratory failure.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Death.
