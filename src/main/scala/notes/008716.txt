HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history of hypertension and
diabetes who presented to the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital four days
prior to admission complaining of intermittent substernal
chest pain.

The patient described the chest pain as being pressure-like
pain around the sternum, the neck, and the left shoulder.
The pain occurred at rest and lasting as long as 20 minutes
at one point.

The patient saw his primary care physician in the office and
received an electrocardiogram which was reported as being
abnormal.  He was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital and was ruled
out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.  The
patient underwent a Myoview nuclear medicine study which
showed a moderate septal inferoapical ischemia.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2116-9-18**] for further workup.

significant for)
1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least 10 years.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Left carotid stenosis; status post carotid endarterectomy
on [**2114-9-22**].
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

FAMILY HISTORY:   The patient's family history is significant
for a brother who had a myocardial infarction at the age of
59.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Social history was significant for a history
of 60-pack-year history of cigarette smoking.  The patient
quit five years ago.  The patient denied alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient was afebrile with a
temperature of 95.5 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was
60, his blood pressure was 145/67, his respiratory rate was
20, and his oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.  The
patient's weight was 88 kilograms.  In general, the patient
was alert and oriented times three.  In no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed
sclerae were anicteric.  Jugular venous distention at about 5
cm.  No carotid bruits were appreciated.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first
heart sounds and second heart sounds.  Slight distant.  No
murmurs or rubs were appreciated.  Chest examination revealed
the lungs were clear to auscultation with decreased air
movement bilaterally.  Abdominal examination revealed bowel
sounds were present.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended with a ventral hernia.  Extremity examination
revealed no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Neurologic
examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII were
grossly intact.  No motor or sensory deficits grossly
visible.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
findings on admission revealed the patient's white blood cell
count was 7.8, his hematocrit was 38.7, and his platelets
were 223.  Sodium was 142, potassium was 4.3, chloride was
108, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea nitrogen was 19,
creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose was 124.  His creatine
kinase was 105.  Troponin was 0.5.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] from
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2116-9-18**] and underwent a cardiac
catheterization.

The cardiac catheterization showed complex calcified stenosis
at the distal left main involving the origin of the left
anterior descending artery and the left circumflex,
approximated to be 70% stenosed.  The left anterior
descending artery also showed 70% to 80% ostial stenosis
emanating from the left main plaque.  The left circumflex
showed a 60% stenosis originating from the obtuse marginal
plaque with 80% stenosis of the lower branch of the first
obtuse marginal.  The right coronary artery which was
nondominant was patent.

Cardiac Surgery was consulted, and the patient was urgently
taken to the operating room for coronary artery bypass graft
on [**2116-9-22**] for his 3-vessel disease.  The patient
was underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three with a
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery, and saphenous vein graft to the left posterior
descending artery, and saphenous vein graft to the first
obtuse marginal.

The patient did well during surgery and was transferred to
the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in the immediate
postoperative time.  Please see the dictated Operative Report
for further details.

IN the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient was
initially on propofol for sedation and was eventually weaned
off.  The patient's blood pressure was labile and required
fluid boluses of lactated Ringer's along with Neo-Synephrine
and nitroglycerin drips.  The patient was eventually taken
off the Neo-Synephrine drip and maintained a stable blood
pressure.  The patient's serum glucose level was controlled
with an insulin drip given his history of diabetes.

By the end on postoperative day two, the patient did well
enough to start on by mouth Lopressor with a stable blood
pressure.  The patient's chest tubes were discontinued except
for one in the left chest which had a small air leak.  The
patient was started on Lasix for diuresis.  Given his
decreased hematocrit to 24, the patient was transfused one
unit of packed red blood cells and was transferred to the
floor at the end of postoperative day two.

During his first two days on the floor, the patient was
somewhat disoriented and easily became agitated in the early
morning hours.  This was thought to be delirium; possibly
secondary to the medications he had been on.  The patient was
initially sedated with Ativan, but the patient still remained
agitated.  The patient did much better with as needed Haldol.

By the end on postoperative day five, the patient's agitation
and delirium had resolved.  The patient's chest tube no
longer had an air leak and was placed to water seal.  By the
end on postoperative day five, the patient was stable on
water seal with no change in his chest x-ray, and the
patient's chest tube was discontinued.

One note should be made regarding the patient's renal
function and his creatinine.  On the first day out on the
floor, the patient was noted to have an elevated creatinine
of 1.5.  All nephrotoxic drugs including the patient's
Zestril and Lasix were held for one day.  The patient's
creatinine returned back to his baseline of 1.1.  Therefore,
on discharge, the patient was not restarted on his Zestril
and should be re-evaluated by his primary care physician
before restarting his ACE inhibitor.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged on
postoperative day seven.
