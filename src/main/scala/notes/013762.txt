HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  At the time of admission, the
patient was a 59-year-old woman with a history of alcoholism,
cirrhosis, possible seizure disorder, depression and a
possible history of cerebrovascular accident.  She presented
to the emergency room with nausea, vomiting and hematemesis.
The patient reported that she was going to bed on the night
of admission when she developed these episodes of vomiting of
bright red blood.  She had one more episode of hematemesis
and then called EMS.

On presentation, the patient denied having any abdominal
pain, history of retching or peptic ulcer disease.  At that
time, she also denied alcohol use.  She denied melena, tarry
stools and bright red blood per rectum.  The patient also
denied any history of gastrointestinal bleed in the past.
Because of the patient's condition, further history was
unobtainable at the time of admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Longstanding alcoholism and cirrhosis with patient on
spironolactone.
2.  Status post apparent cerebrovascular accident in [**2152**] or
[**2153**] with possible right hemiparesis:  The patient later
reported having been in rehabilitation for one and a half
years.
3.  Apparent seizure disorder:  The patient was prescribed
Tegretol in the past, although she had not been taking it
consistently secondary to alcohol abuse.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5.  G5P3, status post cesarean sections:  The patient had
children ages 40, 35 and 31.
6.  Depression.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Outpatient medications included
Zoloft, folate, thiamine and spironolactone.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had an allergy to sulfa.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  As noted above, the patient had a
longstanding history of alcohol abuse.  She also had a
history of tobacco abuse.  She had three children, ages 40,
35 and 31.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient's vital signs
in the emergency room per the emergency room notes were as
follows:  a heart rate of 92, a blood pressure of 138/26,
respirations of 18 and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room
air.  Per the emergency room notes, the physical examination
revealed the following:

The patient was vomiting bright red blood.  On HEENT
examination, the head was normocephalic and atraumatic
without any jugular venous distention.  The heart revealed a
normal S1 and S2 without any murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The
chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender and nondistended.  There was no
costovertebral angle tenderness.  The patient refused a
rectal examination and guaiac test.  On examination of the
extremities, no lower extremity edema was noted.  The skin
was warm with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  The CBC revealed a white blood
cell count of 4200, hemoglobin of 12.4, hematocrit of 36.5
and MCV of 95 with a platelet count which was quite low at
76,000.  Prothrombin time was 14.9, partial thromboplastin
time was 31.5 and INR was 1.5.  Chem 7 revealed a sodium of
144, potassium of 6, chloride of 106, bicarbonate of 20, BUN
of 19, creatinine of 0.8 and glucose of 120.  The alcohol
level was 189.

NASOGASTRIC LAVAGE AND ENDOSCOPY:  The patient underwent
nasogastric lavage in the emergency room, which revealed a
significant amount of blood.  Thus, the patient was taken for
endoscopy.  An esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed clotted
blood in the whole esophagus with no evidence of active
bleed.  No [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tears or ulcers were noted.  Clotted
blood was also seen in the whole stomach.  A single,
cratered, nonbleeding ulcer with marked edema was found in
the antrum near the pylorus with a visible vessel.
Epinephrine was injected for hemostasis and electrocautery
was applied for hemostasis as well.  No duodenal ulcers were
noted.  Otherwise, the esophagogastroduodenoscopy was normal
to the second part of the duodenum.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Because of concerns about airway
protection, the patient had been intubated prior to
endoscopy.  Following endoscopy and cauterization of her
ulcer, she was admitted to the medical intensive care unit.
Extubation was delayed by difficulty weaning the patient off
the ventilator.  The patient was extubated on [**2158-9-5**].  Her
intubation had been complicated by ischemia sustained at the
patient's upper lip during the intubation process.
Consequently, the patient developed an ulcer at her upper
lip.

The patient's post extubation course was complicated by
agitation and changing mental status.  Often, the patient was
poorly arousable.  Psychiatry was consulted and felt that,
most likely, the patient's mental status was the result of
delirium, possibly due to alcohol withdrawal as well as
possible electrolyte abnormalities.

The patient had several spikes in her temperature; there was
no known source for the fever. Throughout much of the
[**Hospital 228**] medical intensive care unit course, she had
persistent fevers without a known source.  A sputum culture
later grew out coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus and a
culture taken from one of the patient's arterial lines grew
out coagulase negative Staphylococcus.

Also, a chest x-ray during this time revealed possible right
middle lobe pneumonia as well as possible bibasilar
pneumonia.  The patient's sputum culture was found to be
sensitive to oxacillin and thus the patient was initially
started on oxacillin.  However, as the patient's line culture
subsequently was found to be resistant to oxacillin, the
oxacillin was later discontinued in favor of vancomycin.  The
patient was kept n.p.o. secondary to her inability to swallow
reliably.

On [**2158-9-8**], the patient was called out of the medical
intensive care unit.  Her hematocrits were followed serially
and found to be stable.  However, the patient did exhibit
thrombocytopenia and, for this reason, subcutaneous heparin
was discontinued.  It was felt that the patient's possible
leukocytopenia and her definite thrombocytopenia were due to
malnutrition secondary to alcoholism.

The patient continued to exhibit a fair amount of agitation.
The psychiatric consultation team recommended that, by this
point, it was less likely that the patient was still
withdrawing from alcohol and more likely that the patient was
withdrawing from Ativan, as she had received a fair amount of
Ativan in the unit for her agitation.  Thus, the patient was
gradually tapered off Ativan for a time.

The patient underwent a video swallow study on [**2158-9-11**],
which revealed that the patient had difficulty swallowing
solid foods as well as thin liquids.  Thus, the patient's
diet was ordered to be that of pureed solids, pudding thick
liquids only and p.o. medications which were crushed
thoroughly.  The patient's meals were supervised by nursing.

In terms of the patient's upper lip lesion, the patient was
followed by the plastic surgery service, who recommended
dressing changes as well as Orabase and bacitracin gel
applications.  The patient frequently refused the above
mentioned dressings and often took them off.  Thus, the
patient was continued on the bacitracin and Orabase ointments
only.  The plastic surgery service later recommended
following up on an outpatient basis.

Regarding the patient's pulmonary status, she did quite well
after being released from the unit.  She consistently
saturated well on room air and her chest x-rays showed
overall improvement in her lung congestion.

The patient's mental status began to slowly and gradually
improve, especially following discontinuation of the Ativan.
Haldol was used for agitation instead.  The patient was not
put on any kind of seizure prophylaxis initially, as the
patient had been seizure-free for the duration of her
hospitalization and the exact nature of her past seizures was
ambiguous.  However, on [**2158-9-13**], the patient spiked a fever
to 101.5??????F and, on the following day, she exhibited apparent
seizure activity in front of her nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**L
