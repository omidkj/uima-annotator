acute process, no significant ascites.  Got head CT which was

which was around 9 hours ago.

STUDIES:
-[**9-12**] ECG: Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Early
precordial R wave progression. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2189-8-27**] the sinus rate is much faster. The other findings are
similar.

-[**9-12**] CXR: No gross pulmonary process noted. If clinically
feasible, consider repeat study once patient is able to tolerate
the procedure.

-[**9-12**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic
process to explain the patient's symptoms.
  2. Status post orthotopic liver transplant with diffuse
anasarca. Known
portal vein thrombus is not well evaluated on the current study.

  3. Trace pleural effusions and minimal atelectasis.
  4. Unchanged 8 mm left renal stone.

-[**9-12**] CT Head 1. Stable appearance of the brain without evidence
of an acute intracranial abnormality.
2. The partially imaged orogastric tube appears to make a loop
in the
nasopharynx.

-[**9-12**] Abdominal U/S: Limited study as above with persistent main
portal vein thrombosis and no evidence of intrahepatic portal
vein flow, similar to [**2189-8-27**].

-[**9-21**] Renal U/S: 8-mm le
