[**2180-7-10**] CXR
1. Cardiomegaly with improving congestive heart failure.
2. Right pleural effusion and probable loculated small left
pleural effusion.
3. Improved aeration at the left lung base.

[**2180-7-6**] PICC Placement
Successful placement of a 41 cm long, 4-French single lumen
Vaxcel PICC in the left brachial vein. The tip is in the distal
SVC. The line is ready for use.

[**2180-7-4**] ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Apical segments are somewhat
better preserved (suggestive of non-ischemic myopathy). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. A well-seated mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. No mitral stenosis is present.
There is trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2180-6-29**] EKG
Sinus rhythm. Compared to tracing #1 no significant diagnostic
change


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 63404**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2180-6-29**] and taken
directly to the operating room where he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting to three vessels and a mitral valve
repair utilizing a 28 mm [**Doctor Last Name **] band. Postoperatively he was
taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On [**Doctor Last Name **] day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 63404**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. His drains and wires
were removed per protocol. He was slow to wean from inotropes
given a slowly recovering cardiac index. As Mr. [**Known lastname 63404**] had
difficult peripheral intravenous access, a PICC line was placed.
On [**Known lastname **] day seven he was transferred to the cardiac
surgical step down unit for further recovery. Mr. [**Known lastname 63404**] was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
[**Known lastname **] strength and mobility. The congestive heart
failure service was consulted given his ejection fraction of
20%. His medications were adjusted and an ace inhibitor was
started. Beta blockade was titrated for optimal heart rate and
blood pressure support. As his diet improved, his preoperative
oral diabetes medications were resumed. Mr. [**Known lastname 63404**] continued
to make steady progress and was discharged home with a visiting
nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] fourteen. He will follow-up with his
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and his primary care physician as an
outpatient. As he was near his preoperative weight without
significant peripheral edema, Mr. [**Known lastname 63404**] was discharged on 1
week of lasix with follow-up with his cardiologist at that time
for further evaluation of diuretic management or need. Potassium
was switched to once daily as his potassium levels had been on
the higher end of normal. He should have liver function studies
on follow-up with either his cardiologist or primary care
physician given the use of both tricor and lipitor.
