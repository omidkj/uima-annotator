of 150 and [**Year (4 digits) 18617**] load of 200,000 with recent admission for PCP
and new onset/diagnosed renal failure ([**Date range (2) 62934**]) who
presented earlier today with increasing shortness of breath,
fevers and rigors over the last few days. The patient was found
by hotel staff (staying at the Comfort Inn) to be weak today,
"collapsed" by ED report. EMS was called and noted patient to be
hypoxic and dyspneic on arrival to ED with a respiratory rate in
the 40's, sats 50% on RA, temperature of 103, tachycardic to 115
and BP of 137/87. A 100% non-rebreather was placed with
improvement in saturations to 100% but still with respiratory
rate in 30's to 40's.  A repeat chest x-ray showed bilateral,
interstitial infiltrates in a central distribution (hilar),
concerning for persistent PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was given 5 liters of
intravenous fluids in the emergency department, primaquine,
clindamycin, solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1, levofloxacin 750 mg IV x
1, ceftriaxone 1g IV x 1, and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. On
arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was in respiratory distress and
history was limited given his inability to speak in full
sentences. He reports feeling better after last admission and
reports taking his primaquine/clinda/levoflox as prescribed (ID

non-compliance). Of note, he was seen by his new primary care

chest discomfort, but is actively rigoring during conversation,
with resp rate in 40's-50.
