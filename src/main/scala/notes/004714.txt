Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2140-10-12**] 5:39 PM

Reason: s/p intubation.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5884**] flap surgery. Resp arrest postop
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p intubation.
PORTABLE CHEST

Status post intubation.

FINDINGS: A single portable image of the chest was obtained. The
patient is status post intubation. The tip of the endotracheal
tube is low lying, approximately 7 mm from the carina. There is
a MediPort in place that terminates within the mid SVC. There is
slight motion artifact that degrades the image quality of the
lower right hemithorax. No focal opacities are seen to suggest
an underlying pneumonia. Surgical clips project over the left
hemithorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
limits. The bony thorax is grossly intact. A gas-filled gastric
bubble is noted.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of
interpretation at [**2140-10-13**] who stated the EYY had subsequently
been removed.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2140-10-14**] 6:31 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o PE

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman with acute onset desat to 44%RA this am, now
mentating well, clear, =BS, sat 100% NRB. has h/o apnea, denies
CP, SOB.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o PE
HISTORY: Acute onset desaturation this morning; to exclude
pulmonary embolism.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-12**], there is
increase in the diffuse reticular changes throughout both lungs,
suggesting volume overload. The possibility of developing
pneumonia either in the right upper or left lower lung zones
must be considered.

The endotracheal tube has been removed. Central catheter tip
remains in position in the lower superior vena cava.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2140-10-14**]  6:19:20 AM


Sinus tachycardia. Poor R wave progression. Non-specific diffuse
T wave
flattening. Compared to tracing of [**2140-10-7**] tachycardia and ST-T
wave changes
are new. The QRS changes in leads V2-V3 could be positional and
there is lower

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2140-10-15**] 8:30 AM

Reason: ?PE
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman with PMH of lung and breast cancer s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
flap, presenting with hypoxemia, tachycardia and hypotension
without clinical respiratory distress
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Respiratory distress. Rule out PE.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images through the chest were obtained
with IV contrast. Multiplanar reformatted views were displayed.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is status post
left mastectomy with post-surgical changes including surgical
clips and a surgical drainage. Diffuse bilateral ground-glass
opacities with sparing of the left apex. Bilateral small pleural
effusions, left greater than right, with compressive
atelectasis. The heart is at the upper limits of normal. The
great vessels are normal in size. The pulmonary artery is patent
without filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolism. Enlarged
mediastinal lymph nodes are seen in the subcarinal station.
Small prevascular and bilateral hilar lymph nodes are noted.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.

This study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation,
however, the visualized portions of the upper abdomen
demonstrates a 2.0 cm cystic lesion within the left lobe of the
liver. The liver appears diffusely hypodense consistent with
fatty infiltration. There is a 2.6 x 1.9 cm hypodense lesion
within the left adrenal gland, which is not fully characterized
in this study.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities. Differential
diagnosis includes hydrostatic pulmonary edema, aspiration
pneumonia and drug reaction.
3. A 2.6 x 1.9 cm right adrenal hypodense lesion, not fully
characterized.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
5. Diffuse low attenuation within the liver parenchyma likely
represents fatty infiltration. A 2.0 cm hypodense lesion within
the left lobe of the liver most likely a cyst.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2140-10-15**] 1:55 AM

Reason: ?pulmonary edema vs PE

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman with PMH of lung and breast cancer, s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?pulmonary edema vs PE
CHEST X-RAY

INDICATION: Pulmonary and breast cancer. Postop. Hypoxia,
hypotension, tachycardia.

COMPARISON: [**2140-10-14**].

FINDINGS:
There is diffuse alveolar opacification more marked in the mid
and lower zones bilaterally. There are bilateral pleural
effusions, mild on the left moderate on the right. These
findings are consistent with pulmonary edema. There is
deterioration in these findings compared to chest x-ray
performed one day earlier.

There is a Port-A-Cath in situ with its tip in the distal SVC.

IMPRESSION: Diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema with bilateral
pleural effusions.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2140-10-17**] 5:24 AM

Reason: improvement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman with hypoxemia, pulm edema?
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
improvement
HISTORY: Hypoxia and pulmonary edema; has this improved?

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-15**], there is little
overall change. However, from the initial study of [**10-12**], there
has been a substantial increase in the bilateral opacifications.
This is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary
edema, though widespread pneumonia or even ARDS could present a
similar pattern.
