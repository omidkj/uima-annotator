Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an obese 64 year old woman with a medical history
significant for MR, DM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, pulmonary HTN with
cor pulmonale, obstructive and restrictive pulmonary disease,
chronic afib on coumadin, recently cardioverted (with one month
of flecanide preceding DCCV), now transferred from [**Location (un) **] ICU
for bradycardia, hypotension and ARF with supratherapeutic INR.

.
The patient had noticed fevers up to 103 during end of
[**Month (only) 958**]/beginning of [**Month (only) 547**]. She denied any more recent F/C/N. Also
no cough, sinus problems, diarrhea. She cannot walk more than a
few feet at baseline due to chronic lung disease. Her baseline
SOB worsened several months ago but did not change significantly
since then. The patient felt nauseous for the last two weeks but
contributed to her baseline GERD. She also noted 30 lbs weight
gain, increased LE edema and somewhat decreased urine output
during this time period.
.
The patient was started on flecanide one month ago for DCCV at
[**Hospital1 18**]. She was cardioverted successfully on [**2154-5-10**] but
developed weakness, dizziness (with three falls over the
weekend) and further inability to void over the last three days.
Her beta blocker was discontinued on [**2154-5-13**]. Patient went to
the ER at [**Location (un) **] on [**2154-5-13**] and was found to be bradycardic in
the 40s (although known to be slightly bradycardic in the past),
have a Creatinine of 5.6 and hypotension requiring a dopamine
drip via PIV (no CVL placed due to an INR of 10.7). She also
received atropine and her HR went up to the 50s. In addition,
she was gently hydrated with IVF at 100cc/hr after an initial
IVF bolus of 500cc (unclear total volume based on OSH records
but estimated 1-2L). Labs at the OSH revealed a BUN/Cr of
76/5.8, a WBC of 11, BNP of 125 and CPK of 63 with troponin I of
0.04. A CXR showed cardiomegaly but no infiltrate. EKG revealed
RAD with first degree AV block.
.
On transfer, she was still on a dopamine drip at 11 mcg/kg/min
but her BP was 113/84 with a HR in the 50s. The admission EKG
was essentially unchanged from one in the morning at the OSH.
She denied any CP or recent increase in SOB. She was admitted to
the CCU for further workup and treatment.

.
EKG demonstrated sinus bradycardia with HR of 58, RAD and
prolonged PR interval and no significant ST changes, with no
significant change compared with prior EKG from this morning at
OSH.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2154-4-10**] demonstrated per outside
records moderately severe mitral regurgitation, moderately
severe pulmonary hypertension but preserved LV function.
.
TTE on [**2154-5-14**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Global RV
free wall motion appears grossly preserved (not fully
visualized). [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen (views suboptimal). Moderate to severe
[3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen (views suboptimal). There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CXR: at OSH with cardiomegaly but no infiltrate.
.
Abdominal U/S at OSH ([**2154-5-14**]): Abdominal organs wnl, kidneys
without hydronephrosis, no free intraabdominal fluid, increased
bowel gas.
.
Renal U/S [**2154-5-15**]: No evidence of hydronephrosis. Four-quadrant
ascites. Pulsatile flow within the main portal vein.
.
Renal U/S [**2154-5-17**]: IMPRESSION: Limited exam. Normal sized
kidneys without evidence of hydronephrosis, unchanged from
prior. Elevated resistive indices bilaterally, with decreased
perfusion and very limited flow detectable in the right kidney.
Differential considerations include global hypoperfusion, as
well as acute tubular necrosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course: The patient is an obese 64 year old woman with
a medical history significant for MR, DM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia,
pulmonary HTN with cor pulmonale, obstructive and restrictive
pulmonary disease, chronic afib on coumadin, recently
cardioverted (with one month of flecanide preceding DCCV). She
was transferred from the [**Location (un) **] ICU for bradycardia,
hypotension and ARF with supratherapeutic INR. On presentation
to [**Hospital1 18**], she was on a dopamine GTT. Her nodal agents were held
and she underwent CVVHD, she had a tunneled catheter placed.
dopamine was weaned to off and her bradycardia resolved. She
remained in NSR.
.
1) Hypotension: Probably due to accumulation of nodal blocking
agents in the setting of her ARF. Other possibilites were CHF
exacerbation with poor forward flow, although her TTE was
without LV systolic dysfunction but did show RV hypokinesis.
Tamponade was ruled out by echo. She was not septic and did not
have adrenal insufficieny. Her TFT's were within normal limits.
All nodal agents were held on admission and she was given 1L IVF
with bicarbonate. She was initially continued on domapine and
started on CVVHD in hopes of aiding in the removal of nodal
agents. Dopamine was weaned. She did have one episode of
hypotension for which dopamine w
