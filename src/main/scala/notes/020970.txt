CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2139-3-19**]
FINDINGS: Numerous small 5-mm nodules seen in the left lower
lobe of lung
posteriorly. No other focal nodules, consolidation, or pleural
effusions
seen. Visualized portions of the heart and pericardium appear
normal.

The liver shows homogeneous attenuation with no focal lesions.
There is no
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The hepatic and portal
veins are
patent. Gallbladder and common bile duct appear normal.
Pancreas, spleen and bilateral adrenal glands appear normal. A
small splenunculus is seen at the splenic hilum. Bilateral
kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically.
No focal lesions or hydronephrosis seen. There is no significant
abdominal
lymphadenopathy or ascites. Intra-abdominal small and large
bowel loops are normal in caliber and wall thickness.

There is no evidence of active contrast extravasation in the
small and large bowel.

CT PELVIS: Pelvic bowel loops appear normal. The colon is
largely fluid
filled. The uterus and urinary bladder are unremarkable. No
adnexal mass is seen. No significantly enlarged pelvic lymph
nodes seen.

BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracolumbar
spine. No
suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions seen. Compression
fracture L1 of indeterminate age

IMPRESSION: No evidence of active arterial contrast
extravasation to explain acute lower GI bleed.
.
Colonoscopy: Friable Post-polypectomy Site in Ascending Colon
with active bleeding. (thermal therapy). Otherwise normal
colonoscopy to cecum


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute lower GI bleeding with resulting acute blood loss
anemia. Secondary to post-polypectomy bleeding. On admission HCT
was normal but after 8 episodes of BRBPR, drop in HCT, and
episode of hypotension, was transferred to the ICU. There a CTA
showed no active bleed. 3 units pRBCs were given and colonoscopy
demonstrated bleeding at site of prior polypectomy, which was
cauterized.

At the time of discharge, HCT was 38.7.

Given patient's reported history of prolonged bleeding with
tooth extraction and now prolonged bleeding after polypectomy,
may benefit from work-up for bleeding diathesis. Aspirin was
held as there was no clear indication for its use.
