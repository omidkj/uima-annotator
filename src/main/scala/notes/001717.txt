Chief Complaint:
Cholangitis, Afib w/ RVR (transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**])

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
87M h/o CVA on coumadin, PAF, porcine AVR initally presented to
OSH with 5 days of fever (Tmax 104) and chills where he was
found to have cholangitis. He was hypotensive at presentation
with elevated LFTS (Tbili 4.7, D bili 3.9, AP 641, AST 117) and
WBC 22K. RUQ U/S revealed a distended gallbladder with multiple
stones and common duct measuring 1.5 cm associated with dilated

was transferred to the medicine floor. On presentation, he has
no complaints. ROS was negative for abdominal pain, fevers,
chills, palpitations, LH, chest pain.

.
Blood cultures [**2179-5-25**]: negative
.
EKG: afib, LBBB
.
CXR [**2179-5-29**]: Diffuse cardiogenic edema.  More confluent opacity
in the right suprahilar region is likely due to confluent edema
although an underlying pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis recommended to
assess for underlying infection.
.
CXR [**2179-6-2**]: No evidence for pneumonia.  Probable residual mild
interstitial edema.
.
TTE [**2179-5-27**]: EF 20%. The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is an echodense region
at the apex consistent with probable mural clot. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with
anteroseptal and apical akinesis/dyskinesis and hypokinesis
elsewhere. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
ERCP [**2179-5-25**] -
.
Findings:
  Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
  Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
  Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
  Major Papilla: There was purulent discharge seen at the major
papilla.
.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast
medium was injected resulting in partial opacification. High
pressure injection was not performed.
.
Procedures: A 10cm by 10Fr Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed
successfully. radiologic interpretation:   Fluoro time: 2.1 min.
The CBD measured approx. 13 - 15mm. Multiple filling defects in
the CBD were noted.
.
Impression: There was purulent discharge seen at the major
papilla.
Selective cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast
medium was injected resulting in partial opacification. High
pressure injection was not performed. The CBD measured approx.
13 - 15mm. Multiple filling defects consistent with calculi in
the CBD were noted. A 10cm by 10Fr Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent
was placed successfully with brisk drainage of purulent bile.
.
Recommendations: Repeat ERCP with the patient off Coumadin in 10
weeks' time, for sphincterotomy and CBD clearance. Continue
antibiotics.
.
U/S @ OSH: as above

Brief Hospital Course:
87M h/o CVA, PAF on coumadin, porcine AVR presented with
cholangitis s/p ERCP stone removal and CBD stent and developed
atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
.
# Cholangitis: The patient presented with hypotension, fever,
chills compatible with septic shock. Interestingly, he never
experienced abdominal pain. At the OSH, blood cultures were
positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae only resistent to ampicillin.
The hypotension resolved with intravenous fluids and he was
treated for the infection with levofloxacin and flagyl initially
for a 7 day course, which was then extended to 14 days given
persistence of leukocytosis despite being afebrile. The patient
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP where he underwent common bile
duct stone removal and stenting. Repeat blood cultures were
negative. The patient's LFTs, which were initially elevated,
normalized by the time of di
