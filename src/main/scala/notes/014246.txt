ADDENDUM:  On [**8-25**], the patient had an episode of
tachycardia overnight and again had tachycardia during the
day.  His beta blocker dose was increased to metoprolol 50 mg
po t.i.d.  The patient was noted to have a left-sided ptosis
in addition to the slight effacement of his right nasolabial
fold as well as bilateral hearing loss for approximately one
to one and a half weeks.  Because of concern regarding
multiple cranial nerve deficits not localizable to a single
central nervous system location, the patient was sent for MRI
to assess for the possibility of enhancement of the meninges
due to carcinomatosis potentially.  Preliminarily, the MRI
has been read as indicating fluid within the left maxillary
sinus and also within the mastoid air cells bilaterally but
without other acute pathology.  The final report on this
imaging study is pending at this time and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16258**] will
follow-up on the official report as an outpatient.  Because
of fluid within the mastoid air cells, the patient will be
begun on amoxicillin 500 mg po q.d. times ten days.  The
patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16258**] as well as the patient
has been instructed for close follow-up.
