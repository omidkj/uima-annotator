Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Headache, Lightheaded

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 89 year old male who lives alone, medical
history pertinent for hypertension, PVD, CAD, iron deficiency
anemia and depression who is brought to the ED by his neice for
concerns surrounding headache.
    The patient was last seen in [**Company 191**] [**2143-8-24**] for a new PCP
visit with note at that time that the patient lived alone in a
[**Location (un) **] apartment, was very hard of hearing, but assessed
otherwise to be relatively stable and OK at that time. The
patient reports that over the winter he feels like he is had a
general decline but cannot elaborate further. More recently the
patient reports that he has developed a cold over the last week
and felt not well with symptoms of runny nose and chills with
cough. In addition to above, he reports bifrontal headache that
has been increasing over the last couple of days. The patient
reports intermittent nausea but denies vomiting. He denies chest
pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle/joint
pains, rash or other localizing symptoms.
   With regards to the patient's living situation, the patient
lives in a basement apartment in [**Location (un) **] alone. The patient
walks without a cane or walker. He picks up his own groceries
and dresses himself. The patient receives no assistance at home
with regards to cooking, cleaning, etc. The patient has only 1
living relative he is in touch with and who visits him. The
patient's [**Location (un) 802**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] reports herself to be the
patient's HCP. She lives in [**Location 932**], MA approximately 1 hour
away from the patient. She reports she talks to the patient once
a week, visits him every 2 months in the summer, every [**3-25**]
months in the winter. The patient's [**Month/Day (3) 802**] has noted that over
the winter the patient has become increasingly hard of hearing
and slow in speech and movement. Given his report of persistent
headache as well as dizziness, she brought the patient to the
hospital for further evaluation.
     ED Course: 98.1, 102/64 -> 184/55, 53, 18, 100% RA. Labs
notable for anemia with Hct 35 at baseline, normal UA, negative
CXR. A Head CT was performed revealing subarachnoid hemorrhage
of the
left parietal and temporal lobes with recommendation to perform
MRI to confirm bleed and evaluate for underlying pathology. The
patient was seen by neurosurgery with impression that no
intervention was warranted, agreed with obtaining MRI.
    The patient denies any recent fall. He does report fall in
[**Month (only) 1096**] and reports he may have hit his head at that time.

Head CT:
HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST, [**2144-3-25**]

HISTORY: Confusion and dizziness.

TECHNIQUE: Serial transverse images were acquired sequentially
through the
brain and reconstructed at stacked 5-mm increments. Multiplanar
reformatted images were generated.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: The extracalvarial soft tissues are unremarkable. The
calvarium
and skull base are intact without suspicious osseous lesion or
fracture. The included paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
are clear. The globes are intact.

Intracranially, the ventricles are prominent but midline. There
is marked
generalized cerebral atrophy. There is high-attenuation material
within
cortical sulci of the left parietal and temporal lobes
consistent with
subarachnoid hemorrhage. This is best depicted in the sagittal
reformatted
images, reference series 104B, images 72 through 76. No further
foci of
intracranial hemorrhage is identified. There is confluent low
attenuation, in predominantly a periventricular distribution,
which is likely due to chronic microangiopathic ischemic change.


IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of spontaneous subarachnoid
hemorrhage of the left parietal and temporal lobes. MRI would be
of benefit to further
characterize the finding, confirm subarachnoid hemorrhage, and
help exclude underlying vascular malformation or other mass
lesion. Please note no history of trauma has been provided.
.
MRI [**3-26**]

IMPRESSION: Limited study due to excessive patient motion. Small
vessel
ischemic disease. Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left
parietooccipital region and layering the occipital horns of the
ventricles, as seen on recent CT.
.
Head CT with contrast [**3-26**]

INDICATION: 89-year-old male with left parietal/temporal
subarachnoid
hemorrhage on recent CT.

COMPARISON: [**2144-3-25**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast axial imaging was performed through the
brain.
Subsequently, imaging was repeated following the administration
of
