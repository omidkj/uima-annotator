Transfer from OSH with free air in abdomen [**2158-7-18**]

Exploratory laparotomy
Resection terminal ileum and cecum with primary anastomosis
[**2158-7-29**]


History of Present Illness:
**H&P largely from OSH report as patient is intubated and
sedated
CC: transfer from OSH with free air in abdomen
HPI:
50 M with history of alcohol and tobacco abuse transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] with free air in his abdomen.  He arrived with
limited studies and records from his OSH however, it appears he
was originally admitted on [**2158-7-18**] for a 2 week history of
increased shortness of breath, left sided chest discomfort and
sputum production.  He was found on CXR and CTA of his chest to
have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with PNA.  He
was
also found to have an elevated BNP, WBC, and severe hyponatremia
with a Na as low as 106.  He was also found to have an EF of 35%
on echo.  He was treated with levofloxacin, aztreonam initially
for PNA.  Blood cultures and sputum cultures were obtained.  It
was presumed that he had aspiration PNA likely related to his
alcoholism.  He was extubated about 2 days ago but required
re-intubation.  He developed hypotension and atrial fibrillation
and CXR and subsequent CT scan revealed free intra-abdominal air
last night.  Given his free abdominal air and critical condition
he was urgently transferred by [**Location (un) **] to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Lateral decub XR in the ED demonstrated free air and he was
taken urgently to the OR for exploration.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken emergently to the operating room for
exploration. He was found to have free air on abdominal x-ray
series performed in the emergency department.

ICU Course and sequence of post-operative course:

[**7-29**]: OR for ileocecectomy. Post-operative admission to the
Intensive Care Unit.
[**7-30**]: Agressive fluid resuscitation for low urine output.
Attempted to wean, did not tolerate CPAP.  Maculopapular rash
(per report since transfer from OSH)
[**7-31**]: Levoquin changed back to cefepime. Sedation changed from
propofol to precedex. Several attempts were made to wean the
patient, but he had decreased oxygen saturation.
[**8-1**]: Bronchoscopy done with  desaturation episode associated
hypertension, tachycardia, and fever which were resolved after
labatelol
[**8-2**]: Bilateral opacification noted on chest x-ray, likely from
multifocal PNA. Agitated o/n controlled haldol, ativan, and
benadry.  He was placed on diamox for diuresis. Weaning from the
ventilator continued.
[**8-3**]: Bronchoscopy with significant secretions and airway
collapse. Zyprexa was added for control of agitation
[**8-5**]: Cat scan of  torso performed for persistent fevers after
adequate antibiotic treatment of PNA. Cat scan showed bilateral
pleural effusions,  dilated small bowel with decompression and
free abdominal fluid with no focal collections.
[**8-5**]: A percutaneous tracheostomy was performed and diuresis
continued with lasix.  Continuing TPN without lipids because
patient on propofol.
[**8-6**]: He was aggressively diuresed in setting of pleural
effusions with identification of new rash.
[**8-7**]: A Dobhoff feeding tube was place and weaning from ativan
continued. Linezolid started (vanc d/c'd).  He was seen by
physical and occupational therapy.  Also reported to have 8 beat
run of ventricular tachycardia.
[**8-8**]: Placed on trach collar and doing well, no need to place
pigtails so far. Overnight with tachycardia 120s, tachypnea to
40-50s, placed back on PSV overnight.
[**8-9**]: trach collar in AM, switched back to PSV at 3PM for
tachypnea/fatigue. TPN stopped. He continued with diuresis and
his  Ativan was discontinued.
[**8-10**]: Salt tablets were started for low sodium. Bronchoscopy
done which showed secretions in right middle lobe, L side, no
purulence. Broadened antibiotic  coverage. Another sustained
episode of ventricular tachycardia.
[**8-11**]: Continued to have hyponatremia with increase in salt
tablets. Cardiology recommended metoprolol. Echo done and showed
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.  Follow-up echo after discharge.
Pigtail placed with high output (>850cc).
[**8-12**]: Diuresis was discontinued and oral intake encouraged (with
calorie counts) dobhoff feeding tube was discontined by patient.
 Because of his hyponatremia 3%NS infusion started for
hyponatremia and continued until improvement in his sodium.
Severe agitation in evening requiring multiple doses haldol +
ativan which may have been related to hypoxemia. His oxygen
level was increased.
[**8-14**]: Swallow study done, ? aspiration with trach in place.
Thickened dietary supplements added
[**8-17**]:  Trach tube discontinued.  Tolerating regular diet with no
problems

Preparing for discharge.  Patient has been evaluated by physical
therapy and currently uses walker with assistance.  Plan for
increase exercise as tolerated and progression to cane prior to
discharge.

Patient will be discharged home.  He resides and cares for his
father, but his sister will provide assistance.

He will follow up in Acute Care Service in [**1-18**] weeks. It was
also recommended by Cardiology  that he have an echocardiogram
after discharge.
