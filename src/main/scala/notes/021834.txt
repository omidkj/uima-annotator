RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2133-2-8**] 2:36 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: assess for fluid/pneumonia

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
51 year old man with evidence of failure on previous CXR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for fluid/pneumonia
This is a repeat dictation for a lost report. Study is dated
[**2133-2-8**].

COMPARISON: [**2133-2-7**].

INDICATION: Evaluate for failure.

The lung volumes are low. Allowing for this factor, the heart
size is normal but demonstrates left ventricular configuration.
Pulmonary vascularity is also within normal limits for
technique. There is a persistent patchy left retrocardiac
opacity as well as a linear opacity at the right lung base. The
linear opacity appears slightly increased but is consistent with
discoid atelectasis.

IMPRESSION:

1) Persistent patchy left retrocardiac opacity, which may relate
to patchy atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting,
pneumonia is also a consideration.

2) Discoid atelectasis, right lower lobe.

ECG [**2133-2-10**]:
Sinus rhythm
Normal ECG
Since previous tracing of [**2133-2-6**], QRS voltage increased and
there may be mild
ST segment elevation in leads I, aVL,V5-V6
Clinical correlation is suggested

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient tolerated procedure well. Post-operatively he became
hypotensive with systolic blood pressures drifting into low 70s
and briefly required neosynephrine for managment of hypotension.
 He was started on diltiazam for tachycardia (120s).  He also
developed progressively increasing work of breathing, requiring
CPAP.
EKG was negative, but chest radiography showed increasing
interstitial edema.  While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he spiked a fever to
101.6 and was treated with levofloxacin.  Repeat chest
radiography showed resolving CHF. Hypoxia progressively improved
and there were no signs of pneumonia.  Patient was subsequently
transferred to the floor on telemetry.  He continued to be
tachycardic on post-op day 1. His pulmonary exam progressively
improved. Levofloxacin was continued.  He was transitioned to PO
pain medications on post-operative day 2 and tolerated diet
advancement well. He  continued to be tachycardic but
asymptomatic and medicine consult was obtained.  Flagyl was
added to antibiotic regimen on post-operative day 3. No clear
etiology for persistent tachycardia was found. He was discharged
home in stable condition on post-operative day 4 with follow-up,
including outpatient echo.
