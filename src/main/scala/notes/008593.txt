Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5341**]
Chief Complaint:
Admit for High dose MTX- cycle 6

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Initial HPI:
69 yo F with MMP that is admitted for High dose MTX- cycle 6.
She was admitted [**Date range (1) 99695**] for a very complicated course of High
Dose MTX.  Her chemotherapy course was compicated by altered
mental status with periods of aggitation and somnolence. She
became vol overoaded with concern for decreased UOP unresponsive
to lasix and was noted to be 6 lbs heavier than admission. She
then became hypotensive, bradycardic, and non-responsive with
SBP 80's-90's, HR 35. Her MTX level was noted to be 499. She was
transferred to the MICU on [**8-14**] for MTX toxicity for HD/CVVHD.
She was also noted to be in acute renal failure and congestive
heart failure. She was treated with hemodialysis until [**8-26**] and
then lasix with good urine output. She  also had some pulmonary
edema which has responded to afterload reduction and diuresis.
The patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] in the intervenig time
and no other acute issues.
.
Pt is able to state her name, but does not know time or place.
She can move her arm on command but unable to answer review of
systems questions.  Pt had no other complaints.

MRI brain [**9-11**] -
1. Continued areas of edema and enhancement in the left temporal
lobe, right occipital lobe, and left cerebellar hemisphere. The
lesion in the left temporal lobe appears to be slightly
increased in size and the amount of edema appears to be slightly
increased. However, it is unclear whether this is a real finding
or it represented differences in technique.
2. No new lesions are identified.
.
CXR [**9-11**] -
The tip of the Port-A-Cath lies in a good position by the
junction of the SVC and right atrium. There is no pneumothorax.

The pulmonary edema present on [**8-26**] has resolved.

CT [**9-16**] - Stable appearance of brain parenchyma. No new
intracranial bleed or mass effect is identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 69 y/o female with CNS lymphoma, h/o diastolic CHF,
CAD, OSA, recently admitted for high-dose MTX complicated by
hypotension, ARF and CHF, then readmitted on [**9-9**] for another
cycle of high-dose MTX, but instead received Rituxan and
Temodar, developed severe bradycardia on multiple blood pressure
medications and elevated levels of phenytoin requiring transfer
to the ICU.
.
1. Bradycardia: Pt developed a HR of 30-33 at 9AM on [**9-16**]. She
was also lethargic and hypothermic. Her BP was stable around
90s-120s/50s-60s. An EKG showed bradycardia w/o block. A total
of 2 mg Atropin was given with only transient effect. She was
put on Telemetry. Her BP meds were held. IVF 100cc/h were
started for an elevated Calcium and dehydration. Her morning
Phenytoin level was 19.3 and Phenytoin was held since then.
Cardiology was consulted and the ICU was made aware of the
patient. Stat lytes, free Phenytoin, TFTs, LFTs and a head CT
were ordered. Head CT was without any catastrophic event. Soon
after the CT, the patient's BP dropped, IVF and another 2 mg
Atropin were given without much effect. A dopamine drip was
started and she was transferred to the unit.
.
In the ICU, the patient's BP was supported with IVF as needed.
She was monitored on tele and had atropine at the bedside. Her
hypothermia was concerning for sepsis and pt was initially
broadly covered with abx, but then selectively treated with
Linezolid for a positive [**Month/Day (4) **] in the urine which was not treated
before since thought to be a colonizer. Her seizure prophylaxis
was provided with Keppra and dilantin was continued to be held.
.
The exact cause of bradycardia remains unclear. Initially,
thoguht to be an adverse reaction between diltiazem and
dilantin, but dilantin would lower levels of diltiazem as a P450
activator. Bradycardia, hypothermia and hypotension could also
have been secondary to urosepsis (pos [**Month/Day (4) **] in urine), but even on
appropriate coverage for [**Name (NI) **], pt still had episodes of
bradycardia and hypothermia. The third possible cause would have
been involvement of hypothalamic structures by her CNS lymphoma.
However, imaging did not point towards this possibility either.
.
On the onc floor, the pt did well for 1 week, with heart rates
mostly in the 50s-70s, though occasionally noted in the 40s. She
continued to receive chemotherapy for her CNS lymphoma. On [**9-26**],
the patient was noted to have again a heart rate in the 30s. Her
BP was 143/59 and Temp of 97. The pt wa given atropine x3 with
some response in the heart rate, though remained bradycardic.
Dopamine drip was started on the onc floor and the pt was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring.
.
During her second stay in the ICU, a trial was started off
dobutamine. The patient did well, maintaining SBPs and UOP
despite a HR in the 30s. No further intervention was done and
the patient remained asymptomatic despite bradycardia.
Cardiology and EPS were consulted. It was decided that a
