Fever

[**2170-12-20**]: PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
58yo F well-known to Hepatobiliary / Transplant / West 1
surgical service from recent admission [**Date range (1) 106084**] for
obstructive jaundice ultimately leading to a new diagnosis of
cholangiocarcinoma with metastatic disease to her sigmoid colon.

She was treated with biliary stenting, currently with two bare
metal stents within CBD / L hepatic duct (placed endoscopically)
and within R hepatic duct (placed percutaneously), as well as
colonic stent.  She was discharged two days ago to begin
outpatient chemotherapy.  Overnight she experienced a fever to
102, presented to an OSH ED, was noted to be hypotensive and
bolused 3L of IVF, then transferred here for resumption of care.

In the ED here, she was persistently hypotensive and
tachycardic,
and bolused ~5 add'l liters of IVF, with marginal response
90s/50s.

ROS: Pt denies abdominal pain except for low-grade pain along
RUQ
which she has had since last admission.  Denies nausea, emesis,
diarrhea, constipation.  Denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
or cough.  Denies dysuria or frequency.


Past Medical History:
PMH: Cholangiocarcinoma, Hypothyroidism, R Kidney stones
PSH: Knee arthroscopy, ?laparoscopy for ? ovarian cyst,
Tonsillectmy and adenoidectomy, Colonoscopy many years ago


Social History:
Lives alone, sister who lives out of state and a brother.
Reports some friends near her home. Negative ETOH/tobacco


Family History:
Mother had lung cancer (+tob). father is alive. No significant
history of colon, liver, gallbladder, pancreas cancer.


Physical Exam:
102.1, 149, 115/57, 24, 94 on NRB
A&Ox3, slightly dyspneic
coarse BS BL, no rales
RRR except tachy. no murmurs.
soft, slightly distended. non-tender to palpation. no masses.
WWP, no C/C/E.
Foley in place (scant med-yellow urine), PIV x2.


Pertinent Results:
[**11-30**]:  Colon, distal sigmoid, "mass  at 20 cm"; biopsy
(A):Comment: The tumor is present within the lamina propria, and
is without a recognizable precursor lesion.  The malignant cells
are immunoreactive for cytokeratin 7 and are non-reactive for
cytokeratin 20 and CDX-2.  The immunophenotype and the lack of a
precursor lesion are not characteristic of a primary colonic
carcinoma.  Given the imaging findings metastatic
pancreaticobiliary carcinoma is likely though other primary
sites, including gastric and gynecologic, could be considered

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-15**] with concerns for
septic shock.  She is a 58 yo female with cholangiocarcinoma,
likely metastatic to the colon (with a colonic mass s/p stent
placement) and s/p multiple biliary stents, currently with two
bare metal stents within CBD / L hepatic duct (placed
endoscopically) and within R hepatic duct (placed
percutaneously) on [**12-11**].  She was transferred from an OSH with
temperature of 102.

The patient was admitted to the ICU, given multiple fluid
boluses, and found to have 2/2 blood cultures growing Gram
Negative Rods, later E Coli sensitive to zosyn.  She was placed
on pressors until her blood pressure stabilized.  She was
started on cipro, vanco, flagyl, and zosyn presumptively; the
vanc and cipro discontinued following results of the blood
cultures.  She was continued on the zosyn for the bacteremia and
flagyl for presumptive C. difficile colitis.

She underwent a CT scan of the abd to search for a presumed GI
source of her bacteremia.  It revealed persistent and unchanged
hepatic lesions compatible with metastatic disease, colitis of
the right ascending colon and the distal transverse /splenic
flexure (thickened colonic wall), a small amount of ascites and
free pelvic fluid, and a RML infiltrate.

On [**12-17**] she was awoke tachycardic, tachypneic, hypertensive and
with rigors w/fever 101 presumed to be still septic, that
resolved w/zopenex nebulizer and demerol.  CXR revealed
increasing b/l opacities concerning for pulmonary edema.  ABG
7.38/32/62/20.  She underwent a CTA of that chest that revealed
bilateral multifocal consolidations, worsening pleural
effusions, now moderate on the left and large on the right,
Anasarca, ascites, persistent hepatic lesion compatible with
metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, lucency in vertebral body of L1,
worrisome for metastasis.

The likely source of her bacteremia is either pneumonia or
colitis. She was treated empirically for both with zosyn and
flagyl; follow up blood cultures on [**12-17**] were without growth.

Following normalization of her hemodynamics and control of her
pneumonia, the patient was aggressively diuresed for b/l pleural
effusions (thought secondary to fluid resuscitation vs
parapneumonic vs malignant, though no tap performed). Her
effusions improved over time, and on [**12-23**] she was without any
oxygen requirement at rest and ambulating.

The patient also complained of loose stool; she was tested for C
dif that was negative x5, though was treated empirically with
flagyl.  The diarrhea has decreased in frequency over her
hospitalization.

The patient diet was steadily advanced; she underwent a
nutrition consult who recommended a regular diet with
supplements.  By the time of discharge she was tolerating a
regular diet, though remained with some residual nausea treated
well with zofran PRN.

She developed a superficial thrombophlebitis of her right upper
extremity that resolved with heat packs.

She had a PICC line placed on [**12-15**] in the RUE for antibiotic
delivery.

At the time of dictation the patient is without pain, on room
air both at rest and while ambulating, has documented negative
blood cultures ([**12-17**]), is tolerating a regular diet, urinating
well and without other complaints.  The patient does remain with
a leukocytosis today of 16.9 down from a high of 41.9 on [**12-15**],
though she appears clinically stable.  She is being discharged
on Ceftrixaone x 1 week and flagyl for 14 days since documented
negative blood cultures. Switched to Ceftrixaone prior to
discharge.

Finally, the patient does have metastatic cholangiocarcinoma to
the sigmoid colon, and so further symptoms are likely to occur
in the future.  The patient is scheduled to begin outpatient
chemotherapy at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital.
