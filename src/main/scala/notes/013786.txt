Service:  Neurology



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 33 year old
right handed [**Location 7979**] male with no past medical history
who was in his usual state of health until the evening of [**7-13**], when he was driving and struck the vehicle in front of him
at about 80 miles per hour.  Outside reports suggested that he
was agitated and post-ictal.  He had a witnessed seizure in
the outside Emergency Room and was intubated for airway
protection and transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.  A non-contrast head CT scan
was performed and showed small scattered calcifications in
his cerebral hemispheres and Neurological Service was
consulted for recommendations concerning further management
of seizures and further work-up of calcifications. The patient
was initially admitted to the MICU.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 98.8 F.; pulse 106; blood
pressure 133/73; O2 saturation 100%.  In general, when first
seeing this patient, he was intubated and sedated.  On
examination, conjunctivae injected.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart regular with no murmurs.
Abdomen soft, nontender. Extremities with two plus pulses, no
edema.  On Neurological examination, the patient was sedated,
did not respond to sternal rub.  Pupils were reactive.
Positive corneal and gag reflex.  Face was symmetric.  Moves
all extremities.  Reflexes brisk with bilateral downgoing toes.

LABORATORY:  The patient had a noncontrast head CT scan, as
above, which raised the possibility of neurocysticercosis.
White blood cell count 9.1, hematocrit 37.7, platelets 120.
Chem 7 within normal limits.  Arterial blood gases 7.34, 46,
35.  Urinalysis within normal limits. Again, CT scan showed eight
small calcifications through central nervous system parenchyma
and one large calcification superiorly in the right frontal
parietal region.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was then followed by
Neurological Consultation.  An MRI of the head was obtained
which showed structural normal brain with no abnormal
intracranial enhancement, and no edema.  Areas of calcification
are identical to CT scan.  The patient was seen by ID service and
had a lumbar puncture.  No other signs of active infection were
detected. It was felt that the imaging findings are suggestive of
remote, rather than active, infection.

The patient was then transferred to Neurological Medicine
Service where he was continued on Dilantin and Levaquin for
pneumonia.

Discharge Diagnosis:
1- s/p MVA
2- Seizure
3- Remote neurocysticercosis
4- Pneumonia


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
