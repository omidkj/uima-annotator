Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
VT ablation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2170-6-5**] Percutaneous ablation of VT focus

History of Present Illness:
65 yo M w/ PMH of CAD s/p anterior and inferior MI, ischemic
cardiomyopathy with EF of 30% ([**12/2167**]), Atrial fibrillation (on
dofetilide and coumadin), Ventricular tachycardia (s/p ICD
placement with multiple ICD shocks), DM II who was admitted to
the cath lab today for VT ablation.  Patient has a prolonged
history of VT starting in [**2161**] with monomorphic VT and s/p ICD
placement then. Since placement he has been shocked multiple
times, once for atrial tachycardia and most recently in [**3-/2170**]
for sustain monomorphic VT in the setting of grocery shopping
and it was nonresponsive to antitachycardia pacing at 188.  He
has since developed post-traumatic stress disorder due to the
multiple shocks.  He has been previously treated for his afib
with amiodarone however developed transaminitis and therefore
was switched to dofetilide.  He was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient who recommended a trial of VT ablation in the cath
lab.
Today the patient underwent VT ablation with ablation around the
inferior scar where he had 2 inducible pathways.  His course was
complicated by poor LV function in the cath lab and required
placement of an Impella.

On arrival to the floor the patient had already had the Impella
device removed.  He was alert and interactive, slightly
confused.  He denied chest pain or difficulty breathing and
reported that he would like to talk with his wife.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

The primary operator was Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**] as
the secondary operator proctoring the case.  Obtained access in
the left common femoral artery.  Inserted a 6 French Sheath and
using a "Preclose Technique" two Perclose AT devices were
deployed without complication after an initial Perclose needles
did not capture.  Antiiotics were preadministered.  The sheath
was exchanged for the 13 French Impella Sheath.   An [**Doctor Last Name **]-1
Catheter was used to cross into the LV using a Straight wire.
The catheter was then used to exchange for the 0.18" Abiomed
Impella delivery wire with an appropriate curve to avoid trauma
to the LV Apex.  The Impella device was inserted without
incident
and with a flow of 2.0 L on P8.  The VT ablation was completed
(see separate report).  The Impella device was removed.  The
sheath was then removed and the Perclose sutures cinched down
acheiving complete hemostasis.  The patient tolerated the
procedures including Impella removal, without complication.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old male with history of ischemic
systolic heart failure (LVEF 30%) and recurrent monomorphic VT
s/p ICD who presents to the CCU s/p VT track ablation in the EP
lab.  He transiently had an Impella device placed during the VT
ablation of his inferior wall scar. He tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the CCU for close monitoring.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS
# Ventricular tachycardia (VT) s/p ICD: His VT has been
monomorphic and he had inducible VT in 2 places around his
inferior wall scar. He underwent ICD implantation in [**2161**] and he
has been shocked multiple times over the years with
post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result. He underwent
ablation of these tracts in the EP lab on [**2170-6-5**] with transient
use of Impella device.  He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CCU for further monitoring. Dofetilide was
restarted on transfer at home dose 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and patient was
noted to be comfortable and appropriately atrially paced
throughout his stay.

# Hyponatremia: Na low at 123 on admission. Improved to 130
later in the day and was 133 morning after procedure without
intervention.  Drifted back down.  Appeared euvolemic so likely
related to heart failure.

CHRONIC PROBLEMS
# CAD:  Patient with history of AMI and IMI with resultant heart
failure and ICD placement.  He denied chest pain and EKG was
without evidence of ischemia. We continued valsartan 80 mg [**Hospital1 **],
carvedilol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], and atorvastatin 40mg daily. He is not on
antiplatelet therapy due to history of GIB.

# Chronic systolic heart failure: Due to CAD as above, last LVEF
30% in [**2167**], and he is s/p I
