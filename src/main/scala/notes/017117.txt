Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
89-year-old woman with history of chronic diastolic heart
failure (EF 70% on echo in [**10/2167**]) with several recent
admissions for CHF, severe MR, CAD (MI in [**2139**]), HTN,
dyslipidemia who presented from [**Hospital3 537**] with shortness of
breath. Per nursing home records, patient experienced dyspnea
and desated to the mid 80s on room air. EMS was called, gave her
nitro x 4 sprays, furosemide 80 mg IV x 1, and started CPAP. On
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, exam revealed bilateral crackles. ECG was
unchanged from prior; cardiac enzymes were negative; CXR was
done with poor inspiration but suggested bilateral pulmonary
edema. BNP was 6218, 1900s from 11/[**2166**]. She put out about 400
cc of urine output from the furosemide 80 mg. Her BP was
initially 70s-80s/40s-50s with O2 sat in the mid 80s on RA and
high 80s on NRB and CPAP. Due to her requirement for CPAP, she
was admitted to the CCU.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,

MICROBIOLOGY:
Urine culture [**2167-12-23**]: pan-sensitive E.coli
Blood cultures [**2167-12-23**]: negative; [**12-25**] NGTD
.
RADIOLOGY:
.
CXR AP [**2167-12-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Recurrent pulmonary edema with effusion.
2. Air distended bowel with air on both sides of the bowel wall.
While this may be due to overlapping loops of bowel, free air
cannot be excluded. Upright radiographs are recommended for
further evaluation.
.
AXR ([**12-25**]):
IMPRESSION: Dilated bowel loops. No definite evidence of massive
free
abdominal air. Please note that radiograph is limited and only
includes a
portion of the abdomen in the lateral view.
.
AXR ([**12-26**]):
FINDINGS: Comparison is made with the limited portable abdomen
study of [**12-25**]. Again, there is diffuse dilatation of gas-filled
loops of bowel, predominantly in the colon. This is consistent
with a profound colonic ileus. For further evaluation and
possible detection of free intraperitoneal gas, CT would be
recommended.
.
AXR ([**12-28**]):
IMPRESSION: Unchanged markedly distended loops of colon,
suggestive of ileus without evidence for free air.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 41171**] is an 89-year-old woman with history of chronic
diastolic heart failure (EF 70% on echo in [**10/2167**]) with several
recent admissions for CHF exacerbations, severe MR, CAD (MI in
[**2139**]), HTN, dyslipidemia who presented from [**Hospital3 537**] with
shortness of breath. She was admitted to the CCU do to inital
need of CPAP.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Patient's symptoms
exam, labs, and imaging suggested exacerbation of her diastolic
heart failure. BNP 6218 on admission. Pt was diuresed with
lasix, which improved her oxygenation requirement from CPAP to
O2 by NC. On discharge her dry wt was 55.9kg and her BNP was
3200. Because of her low PO intake and risk for dehydration, her
furosemide was decreased to 40mg daily from [**Hospital1 **]. Please continue
to monitor electrolytes and fluid status for adjustments.
Discharged on carvedilol, lisinopril, as well furosemide.
.
# Pneumonia:  On the second hospital day, patient was febrile
and chest xray showed new left lung consolidation consistent
with possible large aspiration event.  Vancomycin and zosyn were
begun, and she became afebrile.  Antibiotics were continued for
8 days. Pt's condition improved. Speech and swallow evaluated
her for aspiration risk and found her to be at extremely high
risk (Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale = 1). Recommendation to
make her NPO and consider feeding tube was made, however, on
discussion with son/HCP [**Doctor First Name **], the decision was made to let
her eat with precautions. Son is aware of risks. Pt clearly
expressed her wish on prior occasions to not have feeding tubes.
Palliative care evaluation recommended.
.
# UTI: Pan-sensitive E. coli infection was found. Pt treated
with Zosyn (simultaneously with PNA).
.
# CORONARIES: history of MI in [**213
