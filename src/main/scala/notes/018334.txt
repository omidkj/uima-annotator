Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
unresponsive, hypoglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation for unresponsiveness

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 year-old man with DM1, ESRD, PVD, dCHF, and
recurrent admissions for hypoglycemia presents with hypoglycemia
requiring intubation for unresponsiveness and is transferred to
the MICU for further management.
.
He was recently discharged on [**2127-12-13**] after presenting with
lethargy and hypoglycemia. His course was complicated by left
sided subdural hematoma found in the setting of AMS evaluation,
and AV fistula clot requiring thrombectomy. He was due for
dialysis today but missed his session and per report was found
at home unresponsive. He was brought be EMS to the ED.
.
In the ED, vital signs were initially: 29C rectal 45 150/palp 20
95%nrb. He had an undetectable glucose level and was intubated
for agonal breathing with etomidate 20 mg iv and roc 10 mg iv
and was also given 1 amp calcium gluconate, 1 amp d50,
vanc/zosyn empirically, levothyroxine 37.5 mcg iv x 1,
solumedrol 125 mg iv x 1, and started on glucose drip. A right
femoral groin line ws placed semi-sterily. A bear hugger was
placed and temp rose to 29.7 after 1.5 hours. His ETT was pulled
back after a CXR demonstrated partial right main stem intubation
and he was transferred to the MICU for further evaluation.
.
In the MICU, the patient was extubated and his blood sugars were
controlled [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations. Pt was warmed to good
effect. Vanc and zosyn was discontinued on [**2127-12-17**]. He was found
to have gram positive rods grow on [**2127-12-18**] 0500 in 1 anaerobic
bottle dated from [**2127-12-16**].  Speciation is pending. He also had
low grade temperatures (99.5) persistently. He was started on
Ampicillin 2 g IV Q12H, Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV Q24H, and
Clindamycin 600 mg IV Q8H.

LABS ON DISCHARGE:
.
STUDIES:
EKG [**2127-12-17**]: Sinus tachycardia, LAD, poor R-wave progression,
low voltage. Non-specific ST-T changes. When compared to prior
on [**2127-12-16**], QTc prolongation has improved to normal.

NCHCT ([**2127-12-16**]): Interval decrease in thin left subdural fluid
collection
overlying the left cerebral convexity posteriorly as well as an
improvement in
the local mass effect on subjacent sulci. No new acute
intracranial
hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
.

NCHCT ([**2127-12-19**]): Overall further improvement, with
near-complete resolution of the thin subdural fluid collection
layering over the posterior left cerebral convexity, and no new
acute intracranial process.
.
CXR [**12-16**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of earlier in
this date, the endotracheal tube has been pulled back so that
the tip now lies approximately 6 cm above the carina. There is
poor definition of the medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm
with increased opacification in the retrocardiac region. This is
consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe, related to
the prior low position of the endotracheal tube.
There is a suggestion of some patchy opacification in the right
mid lung zone, raising the possibility of aspiration pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 year-old man with DM1, ESRD, PVD, dCHF, and
recurrent admissions for hypoglycemia who presents with
hypoglycemia and unresponsiveness, called out from the MICU for
further management.
.
# Competency: Given the large number of life-threatening
hypoglycemic episodes, pt was evaluated by psychiatry, social
work, the medical team and was deemed to be incompetent in
managing his medical illness. The patient's family also satted
that they were unable to provide 24 hour supervision for the
patient and were no longer able to care for him. Therefore, the
process of guardianship was pursued. temporary limited
guardianship for the purposes of transfer to extended care
facility was assigned to the patient's son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].  The
patient's sister [**Name (NI) 1022**] [**Name (NI) 21004**] remains his health care proxy.
.
# Unresponsiveness: Has had these episodes last admission
thought to be related to interruption of consciousness syndrome
secondary to cerebral edema and frontal lobe dysfunction. This
edema was thought to be related to the chronic SDH. Seizure was
questioned but routine EEG negative. Differential diagnosis
included cerebral edema/fronal dysfx vs seizure, vs relative
hypoglycemia (given drop from 400s overnight to 130). CT head
and labs were ordered, neuro was consulted, EEG was scheduled,
however, pt refused any further work up, was made aware of risks
including death, and still refused. The patient had no further
episodes of unresponsivess the rest of this admission.
.
# Recurrent hypoglycemia: Thought to be multifactorial etiology
with combination of poor medication adherance, including
confusing levemer with short-acting, poor PO intake. Insulin
Antibody less likely to be a factor as the patient only had
several mild hypoglycemic episodes as an inpatient with blood
sugars in the 50s range, during which the patient remained
asymptomatic. The patient was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] consult
thorughout this admission and long-acting insulin and sliding
scale doses were adjusted.  T
