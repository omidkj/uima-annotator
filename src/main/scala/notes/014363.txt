EXAM ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile, with blood
pressure 128/78, pulse 80, respiratory rate 10, 96 percent on
room air.  Generally, this was a pleasant man in no acute
distress.  Neck was supple without carotid bruits.  Heart had
a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.  Lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities showed no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.  Neurologic examination - the patient was awake and
alert, cooperative with exam.  He was oriented to person,
place and date.  He was able to do the month's of the year
backward in [**4-9**] minutes.  His recall was 0/3 at 1 minute.
His language was fluent with good comprehension and
repetition.  Naming was intact.  There was no dysarthria or
paraphasic errors.  There was no apraxia or neglect.  On
cranial nerve exam, pupils were equally round and reactive to
light, 4-3 mm bilaterally.  Visual fields were full to
confrontation.  Funduscopic exam showed clear optic discs
with some diminishing path of the blood vessels into the
fundus, suggestive of early papilledema.  Extraocular eye
movements intact bilaterally without nystagmus.  Facial
sensation was intact and symmetric.  There was a right facial
droop.  Hearing was intact to finger rub bilaterally.
Palatal elevation symmetric.  Sternocleidomastoid and
trapezius normal bilaterally.  Tongue was midline without
fasciculations.  On motor exam, he had normal bulk and tone
bilaterally.  He had full power of [**5-9**] throughout with no
pronator drift.  There was slight cogwheel rigidity in the
upper extremity with distraction.  On sensory exam, he was
intact to light touch, pinprick, cold temperature, vibration
and proprioception.  On the reflex exam, he was [**2-7**]
throughout except at the plantar reflex he was [**1-7**]
bilaterally.  On coordination, normal finger-nose test. Gait,
again,
was not assessed.

LABS UPON ADMISSION:  White count 7.6, hematocrit 44.8,
platelet 191, INR 1.2, PTT 26.9, PT 13.5, sodium 144,
potassium 4.1, chloride 105, bicarb 30, BUN 13, creatinine
0.7, glucose 102.  Urinalysis was negative for any infection.
CHEST X-RAY:  Showed no infiltrate.
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT:  Showed worsening blood in the temporal
region in the left lateral ventricle, third and fourth
ventricle with hydrocephalus of the ventricle except at the
fourth ventricle.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted initially to the
intensive care unit for frequent neurology checks.  He had a
CTA which showed no evidence of aneurysm.  His blood pressure
was initially controlled with Lopressor, but later on he did
not require any to keep blood pressure less than 140.  A
repeat noncontrast head CT was performed 1 day later which
was found to be stable.  He was ruled out for myocardial
infarction.  It was felt that the patient likely had a
traumatic head bleed that neurologically looked quite stable.
He is to have a follow-up noncontrast head CT in 1 month, and
follow-up within the [**Hospital 878**] Clinic.  The patient's Sinemet
was held throughout the hospital course, and he did not have
any worsened symptoms of parkinsonism, so it was felt that he
did not have any parkinson's.  It was recommended that
Sinemet be discontinued.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Traumatic intraventricular hemorrhage.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Dementia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Same as admission medication, except
for:
Sinemet which discontinued.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow-up with a noncontrast
head CT in 1 month.
