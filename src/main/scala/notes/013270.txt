None

History of Present Illness:
66-year-old woman with history of DM2, HTN, HL p/w dyspnea on
exertion for the past few weeks. She also reports right shoulder
pain that occurs at times on exertion and at times at rest. She
had one episode of nausea and nonbloody vomiting this morning,
[**2136-6-12**]. She denies any diaphoresis, substernal chest pain. She
saw her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2136-6-11**] for the R shoulder pain, was thought to
have MSK pain and prescribed ibuprofen. Earlier today, with
persistent R shoulder pain and dyspnea on exertion, she
represented to her PCP's office, was seen by a different doctor,
and was advised to come to the ED.
.
She reports intermittent constipation. Denies any melena, BRBPR,
hematemesis, hemoptysis. Her most recent colonoscopy was in
[**2133**], revealing grade 1 internal hemorrhoids but no other
pathology.
.
In the ED, T 98.2, P 98, BP 131/94, RR 17, O2 sat 100%RA. On
exam she was pale, with negative guaiac. Patient was found to
have Hct of 14.4 with MCV 53. CE neg x 1; ECG showed lateral ST
depressions that were unchanged from prior. CXR was
unremarkable. She was started on her first unit of pRBCs and
admitted to MICU for further management.
.
On arrival, patient was awake, alert, with stable vitals.

Microbiology:
BCx - negative
UCx - mixed flora
Stool Cx - negative for O&P.
.
CXR on admission:

.IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes. Mild cardiomegaly. No acute
cardiopulmonary
abnormality.
.
CXR [**2136-6-15**] :
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged right pleural effusion.

2. Mild volume overload.
.
ECHO [**2136-6-14**]:
.
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
.
LENIS: [**2136-6-15**]
.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Echogenic focus in the
periphery of the right common femoral vein spanning 1.7 cm
demonstrating normal surrounding flow represents nonocclusive
DVT. The right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, and
popliteal veins demonstrate normal compressibility, waveforms,
augmentation, and flow. The calf veins are unremarkable
bilaterally.
.
IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive residual thrombus in the right common
femoral vein
.
CTA chest [**6-16**]:
.
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of PE.

2. 4 mm right pulmonary nodule should be followed in one year to
document
stability if there are risk factors such as smoking or primary
malignancy,
otherwise no followup is necessary.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis: [**2136-6-18**]
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Small amount if fluid in the pelvis aadjacent ot he bladder.
There is a
small locule of gas in the nondependent portion of the bladder
and would
recommend correlation with prior instrumentation.
2. Multiple non-pathologically enlarged lymph nodes seen in the
periaortic,
pericaval and periportal regions. Two calcified nodes seen in
the mesentery
which may be related to prior granulomatous disease or treated
lymphoma if
clinical history is supportive.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar dependent
atlectatic
changes.
4. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
5. Calcified degenerated fibroid in the uterus.
6. Bilateral pars defects at L4.
.
EGD [**2136-6-21**]:
.
Minimal erythema in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis,
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
Colonoscopy [**2136-6-21**]:
.
Diverticulosis of the rectum, Otherwise normal colonoscopy to
cecum

Brief Hospital Course:
60-year-old woman with DM2, HTN, HL p/w dyspnea on exertion,
right shoulder pain, and Hct 13, now know to be due to severe Fe
defficiency anemia, etiology under investigation, whose course
was c/b PEA arrest of unclear etiology, and patient found to
have a DVT, with CTA negative for PE.  Patient had undergone CT
of abdomen/pelvis in search of a possible malignancy leading to
the anemia, which was negative for gross abnormality to account
for the anemia.  Finally patient had undergone an EGD and
Colonoscopy (see below for results).
