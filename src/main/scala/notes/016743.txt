Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2100-12-14**] MV repair (28mm [**Doctor Last Name **] ring)/ TV repair ( 28 mm
[**Company 1543**] Contour 3D ring)/ res. L atrial appendage


History of Present Illness:
77 year old female who has been
followed for several years for atrial fibrillation and mitral
regurgitation. She has undergone PVI in [**2098**] with atrial
fibrillation recurrence in [**2099**] requiring DC cardioversion. In
addition, she required a pacemaker in [**1-7**] for symptomatic
bradycardia. Most recent echocariogram showed worsening mitral
regurgitation, now moderate to severe. In addition, she had
markedly increased tricuspid regurgitation, now 3+. Referred for
surgery.

Past Medical History:
mitral regurgitation s/p MV repair/TV repair/res. Left atrial
appendage

[**2096**], pulmonary vein isolation on [**2098-3-11**]. Recurrent
atrial fibrillation post PVI requiring DC cardioversion, [**2099-7-31**]
- Prior antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone discontinued due
to lung toxicity (increased DLCO)
- Prior antiarrhythmic therapy with dofetilide discontinued due

Pertinent Results:
TEE [**2100-12-14**] Intra-op
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
-The left atrium is markedly dilated though not entirely seen.
-The coronary sinus is dilated.
-Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage.
-The right atrium is dilated though not entirely seen.
-No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
-The left ventricle is not well seen in transgastric
midpapillary short-
axis view. Overall left ventricular systolic function appears
low normal (LVEF 50-55%) with normal free wall contractility.
-There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm) and simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
-The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
-The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate/severe anterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. There is
a cleft in the anterior mitral leaflet at A2.The mitral
regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect).
-The tricuspid valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Severe
[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated.
-There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at the time of
the study.

POSTBYPASS:
The patient is AV paced on low dose epinephrine and
phenylephrine infusions. There is a well seated annuloplasty
ring in the mitral position. There is trace mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral stenosis. There is a well
seated annuloplasty ring in the tricuspid position. There is
trace tricuspid regurgitation. There is no tricuspid stenosis.
The Left ventricular function remains unchanged. During the
initial separation from bypass, the right ventricular function
was mildly depressed, but improved to normal function with time
on epinephrine infusion. The aorta remains intact.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**12-13**] to complete preop w/u while off coumadin.
Underwent Mitral Valve repair (28mm [**Doctor Last Name **] ring), Tricuspid
Valve repair (28mm Contour ring) and Left Atrial Appendage
resection with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**12-14**].  Transferred to the CVICU in
stable condition on titrated epinephrine, propofol, and
phenylephrine drips. Extubated that evening after waking
neurologically intact. Transferred to the floor on POD #3 to
begin increasing her activity level. Gently diuresed toward her
preop weight. Beta blockade and BP meds titrated. Chest tubes
removed per protocol. Coumadin restarted for A Fib. Permanent
pacemaker was interrogated and temporary pacing wires
discontinued.  Home meds were slowly resumed for hypertension
with good effect.  The patient does have a history of COPD and
took some extra time to wean from oxygen.  She was weaned and
stable with room air saturations in the high 80s to low 90s.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 6 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home with VNA and home PT in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
