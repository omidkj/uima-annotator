ECG Study Date of [**2108-1-4**]  12:53:52 PM
Normal sinus rhythm, rate 79. Occasional atrial premature beats.



CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2108-1-4**] 5:23 PM
AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL CHEST: The cardiomediastinal silhouette
is normal. Ill definied opacity in the right lower lobe is
concerning for pneumonia. The left lung is grossly unremarkable.
There is no evidence of effusion or
pneumothorax. Moderate multilevel degenerative changes in the
thoracolumbar spine are similar to [**2101-8-30**].
IMPRESSION: Findings are concerning for right lower lobe
pneumonia.

TEE (Complete) Done [**2108-1-5**] at 3:51:36 PM
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Although not seen, due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 45027**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1391**] were notified in
person of the results in the opertaing room at the time of the
study.

ECG Study Date of [**2108-1-5**]  11:05:30 AM
Normal sinus rhythm, rate 86, with frequent atrial premature
beats and
brief multifocal atrial tachycardia.
