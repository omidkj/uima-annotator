Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Temporary pacer wire placement [**2101-2-20**]
Permanent pacer placement [**2101-2-21**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female resident of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, with
history of CHF (EF 50%), hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation,
SSS, HTN, and COPD, who presented to the ED s/p syncope.  The
patient was being helped out of a chair in the morning of [**2-20**]
when she became suddenly unresponsive, collapsed into the chair,
and was noted to be cyanotic with protruding tongue and cold
extremities.  Her blood pressure just after was 130/80.  She was
given O2 via NC, and awoke about 2 minutes later, becoming
responsive, alert and oriented x 3, with warm extremities.

Of note, she was seen in the ED for a similar episode on [**2-12**]
when she was found to have a UTI and treated with a 7 day course
of levaquin.

In the ED her EKG was unchanged from baseline, showing PR
prolongation, LBBB-type IVCD.  Her initial BP was 160/116, pulse
94.  She was thought to be volume depleted initially and given 1
L NS with plans to discharge back to rehab, however she was then
noted to have asystole on telemetry, with spontaneous recovery.
She then had a second episode requiring sustained transcutaneous
pacing, at which time the EP fellow was called for temporary
pacer placement (patient still DNR/DNI but wanted a pacer).

CXR [**2-20**]:  Single AP bedside exam demonstrates a new transvenous
pacing wire, the tip of which overlies the right ventricle.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The heart is enlarged and
the aorta is tortuous and calcified. There is no pulmonary
vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or lobar consolidation.
Degenerative changes are seen at the shoulders.

EKG:  SR at 91 bpm with PR prolongation (240 ms), LBBB, LAD
unchanged from [**2101-2-12**].

Echo [**2093-6-4**]:  LAE, LVH, mildly decreased LV, RV function, Mild
AI, moderate MR, mild PA HTN.

CXR [**2-21**]:  A right internal jugular temporary pacing lead has
been placed with the distal tip extending into the right
ventricle. This has a slightly more inferior position than the
previous temporary pacing lead. The cardiac silhouette is
enlarged but stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The
lungs demonstrate very minimal patchy atelectasis in the left
retrocardiac region and are otherwise clear.
IMPRESSION:
Status post temporary pacing lead placement with lead extending
into right ventricle. This has a slightly more inferior location
than on the previous study. It is most likely within the right
ventricle, but precise localization is difficult on this single
portable projection. Clinical correlation suggested.

TTE [**2101-2-21**]:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Basal LV function
appears normal;
distal LV was not seen. Thus, overall left ventricular systolic
function
cannot be reliably assessed.
3. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

CXR [**2-22**]:  Interval replacement of right internal jugular pacer
with left-sided permanent pacer. Lead remains in stable position
adjacent to the right ventricle. No evidence of pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of atrial fibrillation, SSS, CHF
with EF 50%, HTN, COPD, who presented s/p syncope, with sinus
arrest in ED.

1) SSS: Ms. [**Known lastname **] asystolic episode in the ED is likely also
what caused her syncope earlier in the day, and likely secondary
to her sick sinus.  On the night of admission she had a
temporary pacing wire placed into her RV.  Later that night she
unfortunately pulled this wire out.  She fortunately had
external pacing wires attached in anticipation of the
possibility of malfunction of the internal temporary wire, and
she was therefore able to be paced externally until a new
temporary wire could be placed later that night.  The following
night she had a permanent VVI pacer placed in her RV, set at 60
beats per minute.  She was transferred out of the CCU the
following night, and subsequently spent one night on the floor
without any hemodynamic instability.  The pacer intermittently
paces, and on tele she frequently had premature atrial
contractions with subsequent pauses, prompting the pacer to fire
once or twice.  Her blood pressure ran between 120 and 130
systolic for the most part.  She had one episode of dizziness on
the night before discharge at which time her blood pressure and
heart rate were normal, and no events were recorded on
telemetry.  She will follow up in Device Clinic at [**Hospital3 **]
[**Hospital Ward Name 23**] building in 1 week.

Her coumadin was held during the admission for the procedures,
and has been restarted on the day of discharge at 5 mg.  She
will need frequent INR checks until her coumadin becomes
therapeutic.  Her INR on discharge is 1.4.

She also had some superficial abrasions just adjacent to the
site of her pacer, and has therefore been started on a 10 day
course of PO Keflex, of which she has 8 days left.

2) CHF:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] received 2 L NS during her ED course,
initially for presumed dehydration causing syncope, and also for
mild hypotension during the placement of the temporary pacer
wire.  She was maintained on her usual 80 mg PO lasix daily, and
diuresed 1.8 L on the first day, 1.3 L on the second day, and
another 1.4 L on the third day.  We therefore have decreased her
daily lasix dose to 40 mg, feeling that she does not require as
much diuresis.  She should have a chem 7 panel in the next week.

3) CAD:  No known hx of CAD, but EKG with QS in inferior leads
as well as V1-V4 suggestive of old MIs (without true LBBB).  She
has an ASA allergy, and it was not felt that her predicted life
span warranted starting any new medications.

4) HTN:  The patient was occasionally hypertensive to 140s
systolic during the admission, however it was not felt that new
medications were warranted.

5) COPD:  Continued inhalers, advair.  She was maintained on 3L
via nasal cannula with O2 sats 97%.

6) Hypothyroidism:  The patient's TSH was found to be elevated,
however her free T4 was within normal limits.  Therefore, no
changes were made in her synthroid dose.  She should have her
TSH and free T4 checked again at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab to assure that her
dose does not need any adjustments.

7) PPx:  She receieved SQ heparin for prophylaxis of DVTs.
