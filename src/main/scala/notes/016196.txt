History of Present Illness:
The patient presented to [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital at 915AM on [**2-27**] due to
SOB and audible wheezes. The patient has a h/o COPD and is on 2
L NC at home. During this episode of dyspnea, the patient was
96% on his baseline 2L. The patient also c/o slurred speech,
which he attributed to a swollen tongue. According to the notes,
the patient recently started a new medication, which he said was
Chantix three days prior. The patient was also recently
diagnosed with Parkinsonism and is on Sinemet at home. The
patient was also complaining of increased visual hallucinations
at home prior to presentation. At [**Hospital1 **], the patient had an ABG
that was 7.36/47/142/26 on 4L NC. He was given 125mg Solumedrol,
Duoneb, Levaquin 750mg. His saturations remained in the high 90s
on 2L NC. During the ED stay at [**Doctor First Name 8125**], the patient took off all
of his EKG leads and wanted to leave, but was easily redirected.
By 1430, it was reported that the patient's tongue swelling had
improved. The patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] due to altered
mental status and neurology consult. During transport, the
patient continued to have visual hallucinations and was
repsonding to internal stimuli, which the patient says was
baseline for him. He was not distressed by these.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], initial VS were 98.8, 112/71, 79, 20, 96% RA. He
triggered for 2 episodes of unresponsiveness even to sternal
rub. On exam, at first incredibly somnolent, slurred speech,
tongue fasciculations, otherwise CN II-XII intact; strength 5/5
throughout w/e/o L leg foot drop; lungs exp wheezing bilat. ?
myoclonic jerks. Awoke spontaneously after minutes. Lactate
normal, ABG 7.37/46/62/28. Normal head CT. Utox negative. Given
narcan with no change in mental status.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was initially difficult to
arouse. Once awoken, the patient was appropriate, following
commands, and logical. The patient says that he doesn't remember
much of what happened today, but notes that it started this AM
with some SOB and then increasing visual hallucinations. He says
that he has had these hallucinations for 2-3 weeks, which he
describes as seeing people whom he knows and he has
conversations with. These are nonthreatening hallucinations. The
patient also notes some orthostasis, especially dizziness when
he arises from bed in the AM. He complains of tremor, both at
rest and with movement, which he says has gotten better since
starting Sinimet. He denies rigidity or gait disturbance. No
urinary symptoms. He notes dry mouth, but little tongue swelling
now.

[**2164-2-27**] CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)
Mild bibasilar atelectasis. Low lung volumes. Blunting of the
left costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissue
although a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No
definite focal consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
Mr. [**Known lastname 69651**] is a 62y/o gentleman with COPD, CAD s/p distant
CABG, depression, anxiety, smoking, and recent dx of
Parkinsonism who presented from [**Hospital3 **] for neurological
evaluation given increasing somnolence and visual
hallucinations.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#. AMS with hallucinations: The etiology of his AMS and
hallucinations is not clear.  His fluctuating consciousness on
admission with non-threatening hallucinations could be c/w a
neurologic process such as [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body dementia although he did
not have the characteristic motor findings.  The neurology
service was consulted and felt his hallucinations were most
likely [**3-8**] polypharmacy vs hypoxia from his underlying lung
disease.  His sinemet was discontinued as neurology felt he had
no s/sx Parkinson's disease.  His alprazolam, loratidine,
oxycodone, amitriptyline, and gabapentin were held.  His
hallucinations resolved and mental status cleared.  On
discharge, it was recommended that he continue to hold these
medications and follow up with his PCP and an outpatient
neurologist for further evaluation.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# COPD: The patient has a long hx of COPD and is a chronic
smoker. He remained at his baseline O2 requirement of 2L
throughout hospitalization, and ABG was wnl.  he was continued
on his home inhalers.

# CAD s/p CABG: He was continued on his home ASA and statin.

# HTN: He was continued on his home lisinopril and nife
