Splenectomy


History of Present Illness:
This 33 yo male with new diagnosis of lymphocyte predominant
Hodgkin's Lymphoma who presented on day 11 status post CHOP with
one day of fever to 101.4 F and chills.  The patient reported
worsening of his chronic abdominal pain from [**2131-5-14**] to [**9-16**]
over the preceding days but denied any other localizing symptoms
particularly denying shortness of breath, cough, nausea,
vomiting, dysuria, hematuria, or skin changes.  He continued to
have normal bowel movements including one on the morning of
admission. Generally, he reported feeling anxious and agitated
on being back in the hospital.

In the ED, initial vitals were Tmax 102.2, BP: 153/103, HR: 120,
O2sat: 98%RA . Labs were notable for ANC of 36 and elevated
liver enzymes with ALT 243, AST 78, AP 260, and a normal T Bili
of 1.1 (stable from daily outpatient labs). Hct was 24.9 and
platelets 35K which are also stable from his recent discharge.
In the ED blood cultures were drawn and he was given 2 gm IV
cefepime as well as 3 L of IVF . He underwent CXR which showed
atelectasis and question of pneumonia per ED read. CT
abdomen/pelvis was performed given his chronic abdominal pain
and demonstrated stable splenomegaly and LAD. It also showed
mildly dilated loops of small bowel which contained oral
contrast, which could possibly represent early partial SBO vs
early ileus.  He received acetaminophen, ondansetron, and
hydromorphone as well and was admitted for further management.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI he reported agitation, chills, and
fever.  He denied cough, dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations,
change in bowel or bladder habits, melena, hematochezia,
dysuria, hematuria, or rashes.

PATHOLOGY
==========
Shave Biopsy of Left Ring Finger [**2130-4-7**]:
DIAGNOSIS:
Skin, left ring finger:
- Verruca vulgaris, see note.
Note: There is superimposed bacterial infection.

Spleen, Omentum, and Liver [**2130-4-11**]:
DIAGNOSIS:
I.  Splenule (A):
Nodule of splenic tissue with extramedullary hematopoiesis and
prominent interstitial histiocytes.
II.  Omentum (B-C):
Unremarkable fibroadipose tissue.
III.  Spleen, total splenectomy ([**2105**] grams) (D-I, M-U) and  VI.
Splenic tissue, biopsy (L):
Massive splenomegaly with extensive red pulp congestion,
fibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis (see note 1).
Multiple vascular thrombi.
Focal splenic infarction and geographic necrosis.
Lymphohistiocytic aggregates and necrotizing granulomas.
Hilar lymph node with atypical lymphoid infiltrate (see note 2).
-Note 1: H&E sections of splenic tissue demonstrate marked red
pulp congestion with extensive interstitial fibrosis. There is
extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis throughout with
megakaryocytes as well as erythroid islands; erythroid
precursors are markedly dyspoietic with asymmetric nuclear
budding noted. Additionally, sections from the grossly visible
necrotic area shows a large area of geographic necrosis. In many
areas, blood vessels with thrombi, including organizing thrombi
are noted; some are recanalized. The white pulp is attenuated
with occasional scattered larger lymphoid cells noted in a
background of smaller lymphocytes and histiocytes. Scattered
histiocytes with ingested hematopoietic precursors
(hemophagocytic histiocytes) are seen. Several scattered
ill-defined lymphohistiocytic aggregates are seen with prominent
central karyorrhectic debris (also noted in perihilar connective
tissue). Some form focal granulomas, including an occasional
large necrotizing one with palisading histiocytes (slide M).
Gamna-Gandy bodies are also noted.
Special stains for microorganisms (acid fast bacilli, fungal and
parasite: AFB, GMS, and Giemsa) are negative with adequate
controls.
By immunohistochemistry performed on block from splenic section
H, LCA (CD45) highlights scattered lymphoid cells. B-cell
markers CD20, PAX-5, and CD79a highlight few scattered, and
occasional loosely clustered B-cells, including a few larger
forms. A subset express bcl-6.  The cells do not express CD30 or
CD15.  CD3 highlights numerous reactive small T lymphocytes,
which are a mixed population of CD4 and CD8 positive cells
(ratio of [**1-10**]:1).  CD57 highlights few scattered germinal center
T cells.  CD21 (DRC) is negative.
CD31 and Factor 8 highlight vascular endothelia. CD8 highlights
dilated sinusoids, which are focally widely separated with
extensive fibrosis in the intervening areas. MPO highlights
numerous granulocytes, while CD68 stains histiocytes.  The
proliferation fraction, measured by Ki-6
