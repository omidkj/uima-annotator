Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year old
male who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with pneumonia,
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and hypotension.  The
patient is status post an intra-aortic balloon pump placement
in the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] catheterization
laboratory.

The patient's symptoms started on [**2183-6-6**] with
epigastric pain after his evening meal.  On [**2183-6-7**], the
patient was painting his house with his son when he felt
fatigued and slight woozy.  Otherwise, the patient ambulated
well.  On [**2183-6-9**], the patient complained of a frontal
headache and congestion, and started to have a productive
cough of thick green sputum.

On the morning of [**2183-6-10**], the patient had the onset of
left sided lower chest heaviness and left apical pain with
inspiration.  This pain lasted until the morning of [**2183-6-11**], when the patient also developed shortness of breath.
The patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **], where his
temperature was 100.2, heart rate 138, in atrial
fibrillation, blood pressure 111/65, respiratory rate 24 and
oxygen saturation 92% in room air.  There were reported
inspiratory wheezes on examination.

The patient was treated with 25 mg diltiazem times one.  His
heart rate went down to 80 and blood pressure down to 64/36.
The patient was cardioverted four times and started on an
amiodarone drip with a 150 mg bolus.  The patient was
transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for a
cardiac catheterization.  The patient had a CK of 1,527, MB
87.2 with an index of 5.7 and a troponin of 61.2.  His white
blood cell count was 20.4.  Chest x-ray showed right lower
lobe pneumonia.  The patient was started on Dopamine at 40
mcg/kg/minute for his hypotension and given Lovenox, started
on a heparin and given 2 grams of ceftriaxone for his
pneumonia.

In the cardiac catheterization laboratory, the patient had
pulmonary artery saturation of 60%, output 4, index 2.05,
wedge 21, right atrial pressure 16, right ventricular
pressure 43/6, pulmonary artery pressure 43/18, aortic
pressure 108/81, left ventricular ejection fraction 15% with
preserved motion only at the apex and inferior and anterior
base.  The patient had a left dominant, possible co-dominant,
system.  The left main was normal.  The left anterior
descending artery had a 90:% calcified lesion after the
diagonal one.  The left circumflex was 80% in mid-major
obtuse marginal one, right coronary artery moderate
mid-disease with occlusion and appearance of thrombus
distally, involving small severely diseased posterior left
ventricular branch.

The patient was started on an intra-aortic balloon pump and a
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed in his right groin.  No
intervention was done on this initial catheterization
secondary to the patient's cardiogenic shock and hypotension.
The left anterior descending artery and left circumflex
lesions were both suitable for later intervention.  The
patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit on a
Dopamine drip of 20 mcg/kg/minute and intra-aortic balloon
pump set at one to one.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies fevers, chills,
orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, claudication, or
lower extremity edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Left hernia repair.  2.  Left
shoulder repair with metal parts after a motorcycle accident.
3.  Left bundle branch block.  4.  Question of
hypercholesterolemia.  5.  Status post appendectomy which was
complicated by peritonitis.  6.  Status post prostatectomy
and orchiectomy for prostate cancer.  7.  Question of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is intolerant to morphine; he gets
mental status changes.

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 26410**] in [**Location 41801**],
[**State 350**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d., vitamin E
400 IU p.o.q.d., albuterol meter dose inhaler p.r.n.,
Pedialyte solution to drink, theophylline elixir two
teaspoons p.o.q.d.p.r.n. cough.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smoked pipes and cigars for 60
years, no cigarettes.  He drinks his coffee with two shots of
brandy per day.  He is a World War II veteran.  He previously
worked in a machine shop.  Contact information-daughter
[**Name (NI) 8214**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 41802**].  The patient lives alone and does well
with all of his activities of daily living.  The patient also
worked as a fire fighter for 32 years.  He has three pet
parrots who are well.  Health care proxy is his daughter,
[**Name (NI) 8214**], as above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
was a very pleasant, nonill appearing elderly male in no
acute distress.  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.6, pulse 82,
mean arterial pressure 58, respiratory rate 16 and oxygen
saturation 95% on two liters nasal cannula.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Anicteric sclerae, pupils equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation, atraumatic.
Neck:  No nuchal rigidity, no lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:
Crackles at right base, otherwise clear.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, dorsalis pedis pulses not
palpable, but Dopplerable.

LABORATORY DATA:  Initial white blood cell count was 20.4
with 81% neutrophils, 10% lymphocytes and 8% monocytes,
hematocrit 36.9, platelet count 436,000, Chem-7 unremarkable,
coags normal, troponin-I 61.2, CK 1,527, MB fraction 87.2 and
index 5.7.  Chest x-ray at the outside hospital showed a
right lower lobe infiltrate.  Electrocardiogram at the
outside hospital initially showed atrial fibrillation with a
rate of 150, slight leftward axis, no ST-T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient
was initially taken to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory, as delineated in the history of present illness.
No intervention was performed secondary to the patient's
cardiogenic shock and hypotension.  An intra-aortic balloon
pump was placed and the patient was started on heparin and
aspirin.  The patient was stabilized in terms of his
cardiogenic shock.

On hospital day number seven, the patient was taken back to
the catheterization laboratory, where his left anterior
descending artery lesion was rotablated and stented and he
underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
stenting of his left circumflex lesion.  The patient was
transiently on Dopamine during this second cardiac
catheterization.

The patient was started on aspirin and Plavix after the
second cardiac catheterization.  He did not receive any
heparin secondary to his recent upper gastrointestinal bleed.
The patient was also started on a low dose beta blocker and
ACE inhibitor.

2.  Cardiogenic shock:  The patient was initially in
cardiogenic shock secondary to a non-ST elevation myocardial
infarction in the setting of atrial fibrillation and a right
lower lobe pneumonia.  The patient was initially on Dopamine
and an intra-aortic balloon pump.  The Dopamine was weaned
off.  The patient later transiently required dobutamine.  The
patient was maintained on the intra-aortic balloon pump until
his second cardiac catheterization, after which all pressors
and the balloon pump were weaned off.  The patient was not
started on diuretics secondary to his low blood pressure,
which was baseline post catheterization in the 90s systolic.

3.  Electrophysiology:  The patient had a few episodes of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  The patient was started on
an intravenous amiodarone drip which was later converted to
oral amiodarone.  The patient is not to be anticoagulated
secondary to his history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
The patient had a few runs of ventricular tachycardia
peri-myocardial infarction, with no further ventricular
tachycardia, sev
