Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] F with history of CHF, DNR/DNI, CRF, anemia, admit for O2
desats to 80%, hypotension and bradycardia.
.
According to the family member, she started coughing and has
increasing dyspnea approximately one week ago. She was given
nebulizers and antibiotics which the HCP could not recall. She
also had serial CXR which reportedly did not reveal any
findings. THe HCP was then informed earlier on the day of
admission that patient was hypoxic and had to be sent to the ED
emergently.  Also of note was seen in ED for evaluation of cord
compression causing weakness
.
In the ED, her initial vital signs at 2PM were:BP 84/28 P41 sat
93% on NC. O2 sat then dropped precipitously to 81% on NC with
increasing rales. She was given 80mg lasix, nitro and NRB. She
was then 93% with improved lung sound. BP then dropped to 68/28
p28. She got 0.5 atropine with BP response to 90/60 P68. For
hyperkelmia with K of 6.4, she was given Ca gluconate, insulin,
HCO3. She was also given nebs, 40 lasix w/ BP 80/40. At 4PM,
family discussion was carried out. At 5PM BP 54/20 P30 given
250cc NS, 1amp Cagluconate, 1mg atropine w/ BP remaining 56/17
P30. Dopamine was then started w/ 1mg atropine and 1amp NaHCO3.
Dopamine was titrated up with good BP response BP 126/52 P 91
currently on 20mcg of Dopa via peripheral IV as per family
wishes no central line or invasive interventions.
.
She also had CXR which showed a left retrocardiac opacity with
LLL colapse.  She was started on IV levofloxacin.
.
Discussion was carried out with the HCP in the [**Name (NI) **]. It was very
clear that they wanted DNR/DNI. Their wishes was not to prolong
the inevitable should this turn out to be irreversible. They
insisted that no central line should be placed and no escalation
of care.
.
On arrival noted to be working to breath with sat of 92 on a
NRB, BP 99/60 on 20mcg/kg of dopamine, frothing at the mouth and
writhing.  Discussion with Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) 12557**], the pt's first cousin and
HCP decision made to withdraw all care except measures to keep
her comfortable.

.
CXR: 1. Left retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis
versus consolidation. 2. Low lung volumes and bibasilar
atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo woman with HTN, CHF, CRI and hx of falls admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
with hypoxia, hypotension, ARF on CRI and hyperkalemia.
.
Hypoxia: Likely was secondary to pneumonia.  Less likley related
to CHF as no pulmonary edema on CXR and no response to diuresis.
 Patient had been given levofloxacin in the ED but not continued
in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] because patient made CMO. Continued patient on
supplemental O2 through NC and patient placed on morphine drip
to help respiratory distress.
.
Hypotension: Most likely secondary to septic shock given
bandemia, leukocytosis, and pneumonia.  On dopamine drip when
transferred from ED but stopped when reached [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and made CMO.

ARF on CRI: Elevated creatinine above baseline, likely secondary
to hypotension and decreased renal perfusion from decreased
forward flow and possibly overdiuresis. Urine output has been
poor but not treating as patient is CMO.
.
Hyperkalemia: Likely secondary to ARF on CRI, K had been coming
down with Calcium, insulin, D50, bicarb, lasix.  Stopped
checking labs once transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] as patient was made
CMO.
.
CODE: DNR/DNI, comfort measures only per HCP cousin, Mrs [**Name (NI) 61426**]
[**Name (NI) 12557**].
.
Dispo: Patient transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from the ED with hypoxic
respiratory failure. Patient also transferred on dopamine drip
for hypotension. On arrival a family meeting was held with
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12557**], the patient's cousin and HCP. The decision was
made to make the patient CMO. Patient was placed on a morphine
drip for comfort and expired peacefully after several hours in
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with family at bedside.
