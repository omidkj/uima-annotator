Imaging:
Head CT [**9-4**]:
FINDINGS: There are postoperative changes following a right
frontal
craniotomy. There is a predominantly hypodense right frontal and
right
temporal extra- axial collection, which is similar in size from
[**2185-8-20**], and may reflect evolving post-surgical blood products.
External to the dura, there is an additional hypodense
collection, measuring approximately 6mm in maximal dimensions,
which also likely reflects residual post-operative changes and
is not significantly changed. A tiny focus of hyperdensity in
the right frontal lobe likely reflects residual intraparenchymal
hemorrhage as seen on prior studies, decreased from [**2185-7-30**].
However, there is a new left acute-subacute subdural hematoma
overlying the left frontal and parietal convexity with a fluid
level, measuring up to 20 mm in width maximally. The subdural
hematoma extends to overlie the left inferior frontal lobe,
where there is hyperdense hemorrhage, compatible wtih acute
blood products. A new right subdural hemorrhage is also evident
overlying the right convexity near the vertex.
There is associated local mass effect, with sulcal effacement,
effacement of the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and a rightward shift of
normally midline structures of approximately 5 mm. No uncal
herniation is appreciated. No major vascular territorial
infarction is identified. A hypodensity in the right basal
ganglia may be chronic. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells are normally aerated. Osseous structures reveal
craniotomy defect in the right frontal bone.
IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarged left subdural hematoma, with acute-subacute
components,
compatible with interval bleeding from the prior study, with
subsequent
effacement of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle and
5 mm
rightward midline shift.
2. New right subdural hematoma overlying the convexity near the
vertex.
3. Evolving hemorrhagic products in the right frontal subdural
space, from
prior surgery.
4. Evolving small focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the
right frontal lobe, decreased from [**2185-7-30**].

Head CT [**9-6**]:
FINDINGS: There has been interval evolution of the left frontal
subdural
hematoma. There is a decreased amount of pneumocephalus. The
collection now measures 12 mm in maximal radial dimension
(2A:13). The previously noted linear hemorrhage at the
evacuation site is less prominent on this
examination. The previously noted left frontoparietal
subarachnoid hemorrhage appears grossly unchanged. The
appearance of the previous right frontal craniotomy is
unchanged. There is a hypodense collection in the right epidural
as well as right subdural spaces consistent with prior surgery.
A previously noted right parietal hematoma is currently
measuring 29 mm in longest diameter versus 11 mm previously
(2A:26). This could represent either a subdural or epidural
hematoma. The ventricles are not enlarged. A hyperdense focus
(2A:15) within the left sylvian fissure is likely due to
layering of blood products in addition to different slice
position on this examination; however, a small new bleed cannot
be completely excluded. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are unremarkable. The patient is status post remote right
craniotomy and status post left craniotomy. Otherwise, the
osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval increase in size of right parietal hemorrhage.
2. Interval evolution of left subdural fluid collection.
3. New focus of hyperdensity in the left parietal region may
represent
interval layering of blood, however, new hemorrhage cannot be
fully excluded

Cardiac Echo [**9-7**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function
