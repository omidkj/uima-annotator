Admission Date:  [**2104-10-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-10-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2031-10-31**]       Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
gentleman, with a history of coronary artery disease, status
post CABG in [**2094**], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with
unknown baseline pulmonary function tests, a history of
congestive heart failure, and recurrent pneumonias, who was
transferred to the floor with worsening congestive heart
failure, hypertension, tachypnea and fever.  He developed
fevers, cough, dyspnea with brown sputum on [**2104-10-15**].  He called the ambulance who took him to the Emergency
Room at [**Hospital6 256**] where he was
treated with nebulizers, Levofloxacin 500 mg IV x 1 for
presumed community acquired pneumonia.  After that, his blood
and sputum cultures were sent.  The patient was transferred
to the floor.  Overnight on the floor, he developed slowly
progressive hypotension, for which he received boluses of
fluids with worsening tachypnea and O2 requirements.  On the
morning of transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his blood pressure was
82/palpable with decreased urine output.  The patient was
tachypneic, short of breath.  He was transferred FMICU where
he was intubated and started with IV fluid resuscitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD on 2 liters nasal cannula O2 at home.  His last
documented pulmonary function tests were 10 years ago.  He is
on Atrovent, Combivent and Flovent at home.
2. Coronary artery disease, three-vessel disease, status post
CABG in [**2094**].
3. Severe peripheral vascular disease with bilateral iliac
artery involvement, as well as bilateral carotids.
4. Hypercholesterolemia, on statin.
5. Hypertension, on calcium channel blocker and beta blocker.
6. Epilepsy, on Dilantin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol.  100-pack year history of
smoking, quit 2-3 years ago.  He lives alone.  He is a school
bus driver.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Enteric-coated aspirin 325.
2. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 qd.
3. Atenolol 50 qd.
4. Atorvastatin 40 qd.
5. Cardura 4 mg q am.
6. Atrovent.
7. Combivent.
8. Flovent.
9. Dilantin 100 mg po qid.

[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:  The patient was intubated for hypoxia.  Soon
after, he developed hypotension and was started on Levophed
and IV boluses.  His initial arterial blood gas returned at
pH 7.19, PCO2 90, PO2 415 on 100% nonrebreather mask prior to
intubation.  His lactate levels started climbing up with
initial level being 1.6 and peaked at 6.1.  His pneumonia
treatment was switched to ceftriaxone, azithromycin and
vancomycin.  He continued to receive nebulizers and steroids
for COPD exacerbation.

In order to understand hemodynamics, a Swan-Ganz catheter was
placed on [**10-18**].  His pulmonary artery pressures were
measured at 55/34 with a capillary wedge at 25, CVP 16,
cardiac output 4.0 by thermodilution and 5.9 by Fick, with a
cardiac index of 2.09, SVR 1350.  The etiology of the
patient's decompensation was felt to be a combination of
congestive heart failure, exacerbation of COPD and pneumonia.

In order to help with cardiac output and diuresis, he was
started on dobutamine.  Levophed was stopped.  In 48 hours
after initial blood cultures were sent and remained negative,
vancomycin and Levofloxacin were stopped.  The patient was
continued on ceftriaxone for a total of a 7-day course.  He
was weaned off dobutamine on [**10-21**] and continued to
diurese with lasix prn.

On [**10-23**], the patient's hemodynamic status and
respiratory status improved.  He was slowly weaned off the
ventilator and extubated the same day.  On [**10-24**], he
remained stable, saturating above 92% on [**12-25**] liters nasal
cannula.  A physical therapy consult was requested.  The
patient was seen by PT, and was deemed to be a suitable
candidate for pulmonary rehab.  At the time of this
dictation, the patient was anticipated to be discharged to
pulmonary rehab on [**2104-10-25**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
