History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo M presenting with productive cough and fever.  Onset: 3d
prior, pt notes productive (yellow sputum, no blood) cough.
Preceeded by 14d of non-productive cough with outpatient eval
that included Z-pack (last dose 10d prior). Course: increasing
severity of cough over last 3 days.  Associated Sx: 1d of
elevated T to 101.6 max, decreased energy this AM with inability

immunosuppression or recurrent infections.

Per son, pt was not at baseline mental status this AM; following
the below treatment within the ED, the son reports that his
father has now returned to his baseline.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: Temp:97.4 HR:74 BP:92/37 Resp:18
O(2)Sat:97 normal. Physical exam was consistent with decreased
volume status and pneumonia (Crackles at the right base,
diminished breath sounds on the left base).  A cxray confirmed
the LLL alveolar process consistent with PNA.

. Clinical course complicated by 1 episode of hypotension
(asymptomatic) with a systolic pressure in the 80s.  Patient was
rehydrated with 1.5L of NS; his BP returned to his baseline SBP
in the 90s.  In additional, pt received initial course of Abx
for CAP, ceftriaxone and levofloxacin following blood Cx, urine
Cx, and sputum Cx.

In addition, the patient had an intermediate troponin, 0.04,
with no evidence of an acute process on EKG. He has had this in
the past, although his most recent troponin was negative. The ED
team discussed this with cardiology and provided the patient
with a 325mg of aspirin here in the ED.
.
On the floor, the pt has remained appropriate and provided the
above history; his 24hour aide is at his bedside and confirms
the aforesaid details.

Pertinent Results:
CLINICAL INFORMATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with history of fever,
cough, rule out
infiltrate.

COMPARISON: [**2157-4-22**].

FINDINGS: Patchy left base opacity raises concern for
consolidation/pneumonia. There is slight blunting of the left
costophrenic
angle may be due to a trace effusion. Mild right base
atelectasis is noted.
Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified
and tortuous.
No pulmonary edema is seen. A dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is
again seen,
unchanged in position, with leads extending in the expected
positions of the
right atrium and right ventricle. Degenerative changes are seen
at the right
shoulder and acromioclavicular joints. There is diffuse
osteopenia. Evidence
of DISH is seen along the thoracic spine.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yo M presenting with s/sx consistent with CAP.

MICU Course: [**Date range (3) 97316**]
Patient was admitted to MICU overnight for observation. He was
started on cetriaxone and levofloaxacin for CAP coverage when
admitted and then transitioned to clindamycin. When admitted was
transiently hypotesnive to SBP 90s. He was encouraged to take PO
and SBPs remained in 110s. Initial labs also showed a troponin
leak with no evidence of ischemia. This was thought to be [**1-2**]
demand. Serial troponins stable. No interventioned was needed.
INR was subtherapeutic on admission and coumadin was increased
for one dose. Repeat INR was within therapeutic ranges. He was
transferred to the floor where he was HD stable and had no
oxygen requirement. He was discharged to complete a 10 day
course of Clindamycin and follow up with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
