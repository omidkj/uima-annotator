None


History of Present Illness:
81M admit from home after developing confusion on the morning of
admission, pt also notes chills.  Per his wife, pt awoke at 3AM,
and was found changing his clothes "because they're soaked"
(they were not), however she notes bed was soaked with urine.
she convinced pt to return to bed without difficulty.  he awoke
at 6am, not confused, though he did not recall the earlier
events.  there is a possible 2nd episode of incontinence.  Pt
was then visited by his VNA who checked BP, which was "high",
and recommneded pt [**Last Name (un) 5511**] ED.
.
Upon arrival to ED @11AM, VS=101.7  124  156/100  97%3L.
Initially denied cp, sob, abdominal pain.  CXR was suggestive of
PNA (though atypical appearance), elevated WBC (13), 11% bands.
BCx, UCx, and DFA sent. pt started on CTX/levaquin, lactate
4.1->2.3.  CK 100s, but +trop (0.20), EKG with ?STE (<0.5mm) II,
avF, creatinine 1.6 (bl ~1.1).
.
pt breathing comfortably, mentating well, BP then dropped to
88/50 @ 3:45PM, code sepsis, pt given 3L IVF, RIJ TLC placed,
and levophed 0.04mcg/hr, BP improved, upon transfer, BP=98.6
118/61 96  22 97%2L.

CHEST, PA & LATERAL: The cardiomediastinal contour appears
stable with tortuosity of the aorta and wall calcifications.
There is new, patchy airspace opacification overlying the left
mid and lower lung zone, which appears to project to the left
upper lobe on the lateral film. Multiple left- sided rib
fractures are again identified. Pulmonary vasculature is within
normal limits.

IMPRESSION: Interval development of patchy airspace opacity
overlying the left mid and lower lung zone projecting to the
left upper lobe on the lateral film, concerning for pneumonia.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2119-3-4**] 5:06 AM
FINDINGS: A single portable image of the chest was obtained and
compared to the prior examination dated [**2119-3-3**]. Bilateral rib
fractures are again noted. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated.
There are increased ill-defined opacities throughout the left
mid and lower lung. The right lung is grossly clear. Tortuous
calcified thoracic aorta is noted. There is a right paratracheal
opacity likely secondary to tortuous vessels. There is a right
IJ central line in place with its tip within the expected region
of the mid SVC.

IMPRESSION: Increased opacities throughout the left mid and
lower lung likely represent some combination of atelectasis,
edema and/or pneumonia. Recommend continued follow-up
examination.

===========
ECHO TTE Conclusions
The left ventricle is not well seen. The aortic valve is not
well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are not well seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.

IMPRESSION: Extremely poor technical quality. None of the valves
can be well seen. Assessment for endocarditis is impossible.
Cannot assess ventricular function.

(TEE was attempted the following day but the patient did not
tolerate probe placement)



Brief Hospital Course:
81M  with PMHx of remote Colon Cancer & complex myopathies
admitted with urinary incontinence, ?confusion, hypotension,
PNA & ARF with mild troponin leak in setting of sepsis, EKGs
unchanged.
.
# Strep Pneumoniae Septicemia - While in the ED, the patient
became hypotensive, code sepsis was activated with elevated WBC,
+bands, +lactate & suspected PNA on CXR. BP and lactate improved
after 3L IVF and levophed gtt. Most likely etiology is septic
shock given that [**2-6**] blood Cx bottles grew strep pneum
