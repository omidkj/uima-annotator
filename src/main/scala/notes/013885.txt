Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IR-guided double lumen PICC placement.
TEE cardioversion.


History of Present Illness:
69 year old man with a history of endstage cardiomyopathy (NYHA
class 4) and severe CHF with an EF of 15% (EF of 20% on
milrinone drip) as well as severe MR p/w increasing shortness of
breath an O2 requirements on increasing doses of Lasix. On home
scale the pt gained 6 lbs over the week, and was unable to stand
prior to admission. His urine output also decreased from
600cc/24hrs on [**8-16**] to 200cc/24hrs on day of admission. The pt's
wife also noted increased abdominal girth and pedal edema. +
orthopnea, + PND.

The patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after an
admission for ventricular tachycardia controlled on amiodarone.
His course was complicated by episodes of acute pulmonary edema.
On [**8-5**], the patient had a right heart catheterization which
showed a cardiac index of 1.8 that improved to 2.6 after
initiation of milrinone. Appropriate fluid status was maintained
with Lasix 20 mg po daily, and patient was able to breathe
comfortably on room air at discharge. Following his discharge on
[**2155-8-12**], the patient was able to ambulate and breathe
comfortably until [**2155-8-16**], when he began to develop shortness of
breath and developed an oxygen requirement that was increased
from 2L to 4L on the day prior to admission. The pt has also
been on spironolactone prior to discharge which was omitted from
his discharge medications and then re-started on [**2155-8-16**]. The
patient also reports that PICC line for milrinone drip had been
leaking.

EKG [**2156-8-18**]: Sinus rhythm with demand ventricular pacing.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2156-8-5**] the findings are
similar.

CXR [**2156-8-18**]: Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. The position of
the pacemaker defibrillator leads in the right atrium and right
ventricle is unchanged as well. Multiple broken sternal wires
are seen, with appearances different compared to the prior study
being now divided into two parts. The vertical central lucency
projecting over the mid of the thoracic spine suggests sternal
dehiscence that may be worse compared to the prior film.
Bilateral pleural effusions are present, increased since the
prior film as well as there is new worsening of the left lower
lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis. The upper lungs are
unremarkable. There is mild vascular engorgement consistent with
mild failure, but unchanged since the prior study.

TEE [**2156-8-20**]: The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the right atrial
appendage The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are three
aortic valve leaflets which are mildly thickened. Aortic
stenosis is present (not quantified). IMPRESSION: no
intra-atrial thrombus.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 69 year old man with a history of end stage
cardiomyopathy (NYHA class 4) and severe CHF with an EF of 15%
(EF of 20% on milrinone drip) as well as severe MR p/w SOB, DOE,
PND, weight gain of 6lbs in a week, likely due to CHF
exacerbation.

# CHF/Pump: On physical exam the patient appeared to be in
volume overload with JVD to angle of the jaw, bibasilar rales,
1+ pitting edema in the lower extremities, and distended
abdomen. This was consistent with symptoms of SOB, PND, DOE and
likely secondary to systolic and diastolic HF secondary to
increased intravascular volume.
He was diuresed with Lasix bolus 20mg IV and Lasix gtt at
2mg/hr. Milrinone was increased to 0.75, and he was continued on
spironolactone and his ACEi.

# CAD: He has a history of CAD, CK negative on this admission
with no chest pain and EKG that is unchanged. CHF exacerbation
unlikely to be secondary to ACS in this setting. He was monitor
on telemetry

# Rhythm: The patient was in paced rhythm on telemetry. He has a
history of v-tach which responded to amiodarone. Patient also
has ICD in place.

# Respiratory: SOB and increased O2 requirement were likely
secondary to CHF exacerbation and resultant pulmonary edema.

# Rheumatoid Arthritis: Swan neck deformities were stable.  He
was continued on prednisone 5mg po daily for RA control.

# Anemia: His HCT was stable. He was continued on ferrous
sulfate for anemia.
