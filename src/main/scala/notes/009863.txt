HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
[**Known firstname 71525**] [**Known lastname 55959**] is a 75 year old right handed woman who presents
for evaluation following a car accident this evening.  According
to the patient's grandaughter who was present, the patient's
husband was admitted to the hospital today after he was found on
the side of the road with low blood sugar.  Ms. [**Known lastname 55959**] had
gone
to the hospital to see him and then went with her granddaughter
to pick up the car which had been abandoned.  Shortly after
getting the car and starting to drive, the patient reported
feeling her blood pressure go up.  Just about then, the patient
noticed her grandmother's face to droop.  She was not moving her
left side.  The granddaughter could not get the patient to stop
driving, as the patient was no aware of any deficit on her left
side.  She was driving erratically, hitting the curb as her
granddaughter called 911 and attempted to take the [**Last Name (un) **] away.
The patient ended up hitting a tree at low speed this evening
arounf 7:30.  EMS arrived shortly after the crash and the
patient
was immidiately taken to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.   Upon
arrival here, a code stroke was called.

On neurologic review of systems, the patient denied headache.
She reported a pain down her entire left side.  She had no chest
pain. She was unable to reliably answer additional ROS.  Per her
granddaughter, the patient did have a cold last week.

CT Head [**2168-3-8**]
FINDINGS:
Again seen is a right basal ganglia and thalamic hemorrhage
(2:16), with surrounding edema, and mild mass effect resulting
in minimal leftward shift of neighboring midline structures and
mass effect on the right lateral vantricle. There is no evidence
of new hemorrhage, or large vascular territorial infarction.
Small hyperdense areas related to blood products are noted in
the body of the right lateral ventricle (2:19) and occipital
horns of both ventricles and unchanged. Minimal mucosal
thickening of the left maxillary sinus is seen. Mild
opacification of the mastoid air cells is present (5:6).
Degenerative changes are noted in the upper c spine on the scout
image.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged right thalamic and basal ganglia and
capsular hemorrhage, with a small amount of blood products
within the right lateral ventricle; mild mass effect on the
right lateral ventricle and leftward shift of midline
structures, grossly unchanged. No new hemorrhage, mass effect,
or large vascular territorial infarction is seen. Study is
limited due to motion. If there is continued clinical concern,
MR can be considered if not contra-indicated.

CXR [**2168-3-10**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-7**]:
Moderate cardiomegaly is less pronounced because of difference
in patient positioning. There may be a 12-mm right mid lung
nodule, level of the third anterior ribs. Subject to the
limitations of conventional radiography, lungs appear otherwise
clear. Small pleural effusions could be present. The patient has
had left thoracotomy with partial rib resection.

Brief Hospital Course:
Intracerebral Hemorrhage
Location, history and past medical history are suggestive of a
hypertensive etiology. Mrs. [**Known lastname 55959**] was observed in the ICU
initially, then on the floor service with strict blood pressure
control. Antihypertensive agents were adjusted during the
admission. Her LDL is presently 75, with goal < 100. No statin
is needed. Infact, excessive lowering of cholesterol may be
associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage. She does not
have diabetes, based on A1c. The hemorrhage was in the right
thalamus, dissecting downward to the posterolateral
hypothalamus. She has a dense left neglect and left-sided
weakness.

Hypertension
Hydrochlorothiazide was increased to 25 mg daily on the day
prior to discharge. Electrolytes (potassium) will need to be
followed to see that this dose is tolerated. Atenolol was
continued and lisinopril 10 mg started. Further titration at
rehabilitation and by her PCP will be necessary.

Pulmonary Nodule
Seen on chest x-ray, report attatched.

Diabetes
A1c in normal range. No evidence at present.
