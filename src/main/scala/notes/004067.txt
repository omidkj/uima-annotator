History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 106357**] is a 56 year-old woman with a history of
bronchiectasis, likely COPD, ?sarcoidosis, and mild mental
retardation who presented to the ED with acute on chronic
abdominal pain and dyspnea and was intubated in the setting of
hypoxia and respiratory distress.
.
The patient is intubated and history was obtained from ED staff,
hospital records, and her case manager, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 805**]. She lives
in a group home and per report has had two admissions this year
for shortness of breath, last in [**2156-8-5**], attributed to either
pneumonia or COPD exacerbation. She has also had multiple
PCP/outpatient office visits and ED visits for shortness of
breath, generally attributed to bronchitis or reactive airway
disease. She has also had acute on chronic abdominal pain and
underwent EGD recently that demonstrated gastritis.
.
She was in her USOH until this afternoon when she began having
worsening abdominal pain after being picked up in a car by her
case manager. During this episode, she had tachypnea/dyspnea,
and her case manager activated EMS. Her recent history is
notable for the absence of fevers, chronic nonproductive cough,
and no increase in her baseline nebulizer requirement.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 99.9 127 158/80 18 100%NRB -> 88%ra.
She was agitated, removing her NRB, tachypneic to the 40s, and
not moving air on exam. She became hypertensive to SBP 180-200
and had worsening hypoxia to the low 80s on room air. She was
then intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and tachypnea,
and was given methylpred 125, bronchodilators, and levofloxacin,
after which she was noted to be moving air more effectively. She
also was given 3L NS.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she is intubated and sedated on
propofol. She is accompanied by her case manager. Of note, ROS
is negative for change in bowel or bladder movement, blood in
stool, diarrhea, or nausea, though patient has chronically
reduced appetite with 50 lb weight loss over past year.

lung disease on these scans and no further workup was pursued at
the time.
2.   ? allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)
3.   Type 2 diabetes.
4.   Hypertension.
5.   Schizophrenia.
6.   Hepatitis C.
7.   Mild mental retardation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 106357**] is a 56 year-old woman with a history of
bronchiectasis, likely COPD, ?sarcoidosis, and mild mental
retardation who presented to the ED with acute on chronic
abdominal pain and dyspnea and was intubated in the setting of
hypoxia and respiratory distress.

Respiratory failure:
Pt was intubated in the setting of hypoxia, tachypnea, and
hypertension in ED. Found to have poor air movement on exam. No
significant pulmonary edema on cxr although circumstances raised
question if pt had flash edema. Initial ABG showed mild acidosis
with mild CO2 retention. She was started on IV steroids as well
as broad spectrum Abx vanc/cefepime/azithro for emperic PNA
coverage. Albuterol/ipratropium inhalers continued. When CXR
showed no obvious infiltrate taken off Vanco/Cefepime and unasyn
added for possibility of aspiration event. Question of fluid
overload was raised so pt given IV lasix with good diuresis
response. Pt with continued wheezing on auscultation, so
albuterol inhaler changed from Q6hr to Q2hr. Vent was then
weaned to PS from CMV. Vanco was briefly restarted as sputum GS
showed GPC but then stopped again once culture grew commensal
organisms. Unasyn was also stopped at this point. BNP was WNL
and ECHO was done which showed grossly normal heart.  On morning
of [**10-7**] pt was successfully extubated. Pts respiratory status
remained stable as she was monitored overnight in the ICU before
transfer to the floor.  She continued to be stable on the floor
and discharged with a steroid taper.  Her underlying lung
disease requires further outpatient workup but at the present
time the most likely cause for her acute deterioration was a
COPD flare.

Abdominal pain/Gastritis: Initial symptoms prompted by acute on
chronic abdominal pain, unclear etiology with known gastritis
and hepatitis C, and no acute etiology on abdominal CT in [**3-17**].
Improved without treatment.

Schizophrenia:  no change in outpatient management.
