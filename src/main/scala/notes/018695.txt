Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD [**1-4**]: IMPRESSION: 1) No new hemorrhage. 2) Resolution
of left lenticular extra-axial hematoma. 3)  Other subdural,
subarachnoid, intraventricular, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages
 appear essentially unchanged. 4)  Dense material within
sphenoidal sinus may represent blood or inspissated mucus.
.

CT HEAD [**1-1**]: IMPRESSION:  1.3 cm diameter new focus of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe
posteriorly in an otherwise essentially unchanged Head CT
demonstrating subdural, subarachnoid, intraventricular, and
intraparenchymal and epidural hemorrhage.
.
CT HEAD [**12-31**]: IMPRESSION: 1.  Large left parietooccipital
parenchymal hematoma with surrounding edema and small
pneumocephalus. 2.  Contre-coup contusion of the right frontal
lobe and right temporal pole. 3.  Thin layering subdural
hematoma on the left and possibly also on the right.
4.  Bifrontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  5.  Left occipital
subgaleal hematoma with subcutaneous gas, laterally. 6.  Left
parietal bone fracture that extends to involve the occipital and
temporal bones. The temporal bone fracture extends through the
middle ear cavity, mastoid air cells and the bony plate of the
external auditory canal. Associated disruption of the inner ear
structures (eg. ossicular chain, facial nerve) cannot be
excluded, and dedicate thin-section temporal bone CT should be
considered (with clearing of blood from these compartments),
when feasible. 7.  Well-defined hypodensity of the left
occipital pole, most likely represents established
encephalomalacia, secondary to prior infarction (concordant with
the vague h/o "stroke," though in unknown distribution. Less
likely, this may represent acute infarction secondary to injury
to the
transverse venous sinus, given the fracture component and
ill-defined
hemorrhage in this region.
.
[**12-31**] CT C-SPINE: IMPRESSION:  No acute fracture or malalignment
in the cervical spine.
.
[**12-31**] CT PELVIS: IMPRESSION:  Nondisplaced fracture of the right
L4 transverse process, otherwise no acute traumatic injury in
the chest, abdomen or pelvis.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**12-31**] Pt was admitted directly to the Trauma ICU following stat
trauma code with non-paralyzed field intubation for GCS of 3
following fall from roof with direct head impact.  Pt was
paralyzed and reintubated in the [**Hospital1 18**] for a Right mainstem
bronchus field intubation. Pt received CT scans of his head,
c-spine, abdomen, and pelvis with findings as described above,
as well as a chest xray.  An arterial line was placed,
mechanical ventilation was started, IV hydration was given, an
seizure prophylactic dose of Dilantin was given.
.
[**1-1**] A repeat head CT was performed with the above findings.
The patient's neuro exam improved somewhat with purposeful
movements and spontaneous eye opening, no following of commands,
with positive gag and cough.  A standing Dilantin dose was
started.  He remained intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
His arterial line was changed.  Tube feeds were started via NG
tube.
.
[**1-2**] There was no change in the pt's neuro exam.  He remained
intubated and on mechanical ventilation.  He was started on NPH
for better blood sugar control.
.
[**1-3**] Neuro exam unchanged.  Moves all extremities with purpose,
eyes open spontaneously, not following commands.  Dilantin
continued, still intubated and on vent.  Serum creatinine
increasing, with subsequent increase in fluid resuscitation by
ICU team.  Family notified of poor overall prognosis by
Neurosurgery.
.
[**1-4**] Follow-up Head CT obtained with above findings.  No change
in neuro exam.  Family meeting held with discussion of
trach/PEG, poor overall prognosis conveyed.  N/S signed off of
patient.
.
[**1-5**] Pt febrile to 102.8, WBC 11.4.  IV Cipro started.  Neuro
exam unchanged.
.
[**1-6**] Family declines trach/peg and decides on extubation when
other family members can be present.
.
[**1-7**] No changes in management.  Pt intubated and on vent,
stable.  Pt still febrile to 102.3 and continues on Cipro IV.
.
[**1-8**] Pt extubated with family present.  Family decides on CMO
for patient based on his pre-accident wishes.  Support meds
withdrawn.
.
[**1-9**] Pt continues to be febrile to 101.4.  IV Cipro withdrawn.
Pt discharged to [**Hospital1 656**] Family House and Hospice for palliative
care.
