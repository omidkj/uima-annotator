.
Imaging:
[**12-2**] CXR: There are bibasal effusions with infiltrates at both
lung bases, more marked
on the right. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
CONCLUSION:
Infiltrates at lung bases, highly suggestive of consolidation.
Please ensure
followup to clearance.
.
US liver: Sludge-filled gallbladder with tiny gallstones. No
evidence of acute
cholecystitis.
.
[**12-5**] CT chest: Diffuse bilateral airspace consolidation
predominantly involving
the lower lobes, but also involving the upper lobes more
focally. Diffuse
ground-glass attenuation of the aerated portions of the lungs,
with relative
sparing of the lung apices.
,
[**12-5**] CT sinuses: Pansinusitis. No evidence of erosive bone
changes.
,
Echo: Suboptimal image quality. Mild mitral regurgitation
without discrete vegetation. Mild aortic valve sclerosis. Normal
biventricular cavity sizes with excellent global and normal
regional biventricular systolic function.
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
.
[**12-13**] CT chest: 1. Increased bilateral nonhemorrhagic layering
pleural effusion, now
moderate-to-large and increased multifocal consolidation and
ground-glass
opacity, more widespread and more dense, could be worsening of
multifocal
pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, or developing ARDS, should be
correlated with
labs.
2. Signs of anemia.
3. Gallstone.

[**12-21**] LENIs:
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of DVT.

[**12-21**] RUQ U/S:
IMPRESSION:
1. Sludge and stone-filled gallbladder with no definite evidence
of acute
cholecystitis, though the gallbladder does appear moderately
distended. If
clinical concern for cholecystitis persists, recommend further
evaluation with
a HIDA scan.
2. Unchanged echogenic nodule at hepatic dome.

[**12-23**] CTA CHEST/CT ABD/CT PELVIS:
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Diffuse pulmonary consolidations and ground-glass opacities
are increased in density and extent compared to [**2178-12-13**].
2. Anasarca. Moderate right greater than left pleural effusions
are also
slightly increased.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
4. Mildly prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, non-specific and
unchanged.
5. Cholelithiasis, without CT evidence for acute cholecystitis.
No acute
intra- abdominal pathology seen to account for the patient's
symptoms.

[**12-23**] CT SINUS:
Marked improvement in chronic sinus disease. No evidence of
abnormal
enhancing lesions or osseous destruction.
