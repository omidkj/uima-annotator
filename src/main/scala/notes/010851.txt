HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old Russian
woman with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperthyroid,
elevated LFTs, gastritis, anemia, who had three prior
admissions for shortness of breath and chest pain.  Most
recently ruled out for an MI three weeks ago with a previous
admit of [**3-10**] for left sided pleural effusion and shortness
of breath.  Effusion was tapped and was found to be
transudative in nature with mild elevations in her pulmonary
arterial pressures and question right heart failure at that
time.  She was discharged on Lasix but was not taking any
currently on [**6-9**].  She presents again with shortness of
breath.  The week prior to this admission the patient noticed
increasing dyspnea on exertion and increasing lower extremity
edema with transient chest pain plus minus pleuritic in
nature.  She went to her PCP's office and had an
echocardiogram there which showed increased pulmonary
arterial pressures to 79, 3+ TR and normal left ventricular
function with a sinus bradycardia at 52.  She was sent to the
Emergency Room for concern of PE.  She had an oxygen
saturation of 100% on room air in the Emergency Room.  CT
angio was negative for PE.  Chest x-ray and CT showed a right
base patchy infiltrate and effusion with interval increase in
size in her bulky mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy on
the CT scan.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Revealed a baseline weight of 120 lbs,
had a recent weight loss with Lasix treatment, no nausea,
vomiting or diarrhea, no melena, no weakness, no dizziness
and positive complaints of chest pain when her blood pressure
is high, relieved with sublingual Nitro.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia.  The patient had previously been on
Lipitor but this was stopped secondary to increased LFTs,
hyperthyroidism.  The patient was diagnosed in [**2118-3-10**]
with hyperthyroidism with an undetectable TSH and high T4.
The patient had been started on Tapazole but this was also
discontinued three weeks ago because of increased LFTs.
History of chronic anxiety and depression, gastritis, anemia.
The patient is seeing Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.  History of
a transudative pleural effusion in [**3-10**], rule out MI on
[**2118-5-19**], increased LFTs and increased pulmonary arterial
pressures and question right heart failure.

MEDICATIONS:  Patient was on Compazine prn, sublingual Nitro,
Prilosec 20 mg q d, Lithium 250 mg q d, Trazodone 50 mg q d,
Restoril 30 mg q d, Calcium supplements, Vitamin D.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired pharmacist.  She is
married and lives with her husband.  She is originally from
[**Country 532**].  She is a 20 pack year tobacco history, quit in [**2118-3-10**].  She moved from [**Country 532**] 8 years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease.  Her
brothers both had MIs at the age of 40 and no history of DVT.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She had vitals, temperature 96.2,
heart rate 47, blood pressure 140/45, respiratory rate 16, O2
100% on room air.  In general she is alert and pleasant,
spoke in full sentences, in no acute distress.  HEENT:
Revealed anicteric sclera, oropharynx was clear without
ulcers or lesions, positive gingival bleeding.  Neck,
positive JVD to the jaw at a 45 degree angle, positive
hepatojugular reflux.  Chest, decreased breath sounds and
positive dullness to percussion at the right base.  Heart,
bradycardic, regular S1 and S2, [**2-15**] murmur at the right and
left lower sternal borders, no right ventricular heave.
Abdomen soft, nontender, non distended, liver edge at one
inch past the costal margin, no splenomegaly.  Extremities,
no clubbing, 2+ pitting edema to mid shins, no calf
tenderness, positive spider angiomas over ankles bilaterally.
Neuro exam, alert and oriented times three, grossly non
focal, positive tremulousness.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission labs include a white count of
7.3, hematocrit 31.5, platelet count 245,000, INR 1.2, PTT
27, calcium 9.7, sodium 139, potassium 5.1, hemolyzed,
chloride 107, CO2 17, BUN 29, creatinine 0.9, glucose 93, CK
44, troponin less than 0.3, Lithium less than 0.2.

Pertinent recent exam, on [**2118-4-18**] the patient had an ESR of
46, negative [**Doctor First Name **].  On [**5-31**] ALT 53, AST 39, alkaline
phosphatase 408, BR 0.4, TSH less than 0.05, hep B surface
antigen negative, hep B surface antibody negative, hep A
antibody positive, hep C antibody negative, hep C PCR
negative.  ANCA negative.  SPEP negative.  Iron 24, TIBC 264,
ferritin 203, B12 540, Folate 13.7.  Chest x-ray showed
cardiomegaly with mild CHF, small bilateral pleural
effusions, right greater than left, patchy opacity at the
right base, no pneumothorax.  CT angio was negative for PE,
showed positive bulky lymphadenopathy and a right lung
opacity.  Echo report from Dr.[**Name (NI) 10962**] office earlier that
day, pulmonary arterial pressure 79, 3+ TR, normal left
ventricular function.  Echocardiogram from [**2118-3-7**] showed a
pulmonary arterial pressure of 36, mild MR and normal left
ventricular function.  EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 47
beats per minute, normal access, normal intervals, positive T
wave inversions in V2 and V3 that were new.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary hypertension. The patient had a repeat
echocardiogram on [**2118-6-10**] that showed the left atrium mildly
dilated, right atrium mildly dilated, positive PFO, left
ventricular function normal, right ventricle mildly dilated,
RVSS slightly depressed, pulmonary arterial pressure 45-58
mmHg and 2+ TR.  The second echocardiogram was done after the
patient was diuresed with IV Lasix and was given Nitro Paste
due to the four previous echos which all showed normal left
ventricular function.  The diagnosis was leaning towards
primary pulmonary hypertension and the patient was scheduled
to have a bronchoscopy with short acting vasodilator trials,
however, after the patient's cardiac catheterization where
wedge pressure was found to be 24, differential was changed
to include left heart failure, elevated left sided pressure,
as contributing to the elevated pulmonary arterial pressures.
Definitive diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension remains
unresolved.

2.  Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.  There has been an
interval increase in size of the lymphadenopathy from her
scans in [**Month (only) 958**] to the scan on [**6-9**].  The patient is planning
on having an outpatient bronchoscopy and needle biopsy with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20501**].

3.  Right sided pleural effusion.  This effusion resolved
after several days of Lasix.

4.  Coronary artery disease.  The patient had an episode of
chest pain on [**2118-6-11**] after ambulating from the bathroom.  She
had 10/10 chest pain, positive nausea, positive diaphoresis.
EKG showed ST depression in V4 through V6 that was new.
Blood pressures were in the 180's at the time and pain was
relieved by three sublingual Nitroglycerin.  With the
resolution of pain, her EKG changes normalized.  The patient
ruled out by serial CK's.  The patient was taken to cardiac
catheterization on [**2118-6-14**].  Exam was notable for 75% stenosis
in the D1.  The lesion was crossed with a BMW wire.  After
crossing the lesion the patient experienced an episode of VF
with loss of consciousness.  She was treated with 360 joules
and IV Atropine with the recovery of consciousness.  After
PTCA times one, there was a residual stenosis of 20%.  Mean
RA pressure was 13 mmHg, mean PCWP 24 mmHg with prominent V
waves at 46 mmHg and LVEDP was 25 mmHg.  Cardiac index was
preserved at 2.8 liters per minute per meter sq.  Saturation
revealed a 10% oxygen saturation step-up from 62 to 72% at
the level of the mid right atrium consistent with a left to
right shunt.  Calculated fraction was 1.13.  Left
ventriculography revealed anterolateral wall hypokinesis,
calculated LVEF was 41%. Impression:  Moderate systolic
ventricular dysfunction and one vessel coronary artery
disease.  The patient was started on Univasc 15 mg [**Hospital1 **], Lasix
20 mg q
