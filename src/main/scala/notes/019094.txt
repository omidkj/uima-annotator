Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea and chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 33801**] is a [**Age over 90 **]M w/ CAD, chronic systolic CHF (EF 40%) per
outside hospital records, DMII, and a recent OSH admission from
[**Date range (1) **] at [**Hospital3 **] for NSTEMI and aspiration PNA
leading to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
The patient was initially discharged to rehab, but then
readmitted to [**Hospital3 7571**]on [**2132-5-29**] with chest pressure and
dyspnea concerning for a CHF exacerbation. Per the discharge
summary from Nashova, a 12-lead EKG reportedly showed global
mild ST depression, most pronounced in the lateral and anterior
leads with cardiac enzymes: CPK 24-21-20. Trop 0.91-0.9-0.14.
Other notable labs while at [**Location (un) **] included a BUN 33->39, Cr
1.4->1.6. The patient was treated in ICU at Nashova for CHF
exacerbation with lasix and, for a brief time, CPAP, and was
also treated for ACS with IV heparin given his symptoms of chest
pain and EKG changes. Thus, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for elective cardiac catherization. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the
patient complained of some mild dyspnea while seated in bed as
well as a cough productive of white sputum. He reports sleeping
with 1 pillow due to comfort not orthopnea. He denies fever,
chills, sweats, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain,
palpitations, PND, wheezing, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea,
hematochezia, melena, edema, or calf pain.
.
Shortly after arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was brought to the
cath lab on [**5-30**] where he was found to have elevated right and
left heart pressures (mean RA 15, PA systolic 70's, PCWP 36),
with a preserved CI of 2.4. Due to high pressures, angiography
was decided to be postponed for agressive diuresis given the
high risk of respiratory failure requiring intubation that would
have been associated with proceeding with angiography. A swan
ganz catheter was placed in the cath lab, and the patient was
transferred to the CCU for further care. Of note, the patient
was given a single dose of 40mg IV Lasix while in the cath lab
and produced ~250cc of urine in the first hour.

=============================
Cardiac Cath [**2132-5-30**]:
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart
filling
pressures with a mean RA of 15mmHg and mean PCWP of 37mmHg.
There was
pulmonary artery hypertension with a PASP of 71mmHg.  The
cardiac index
was preserved at 2.2 l/min/m2
2. Given the elevated filling pressures, angiography was
deferred
pending further diuresis.
  FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Markedly elevated left heart filling pressure and moderately
elevated right heart filling pressure

CXR [**2132-5-30**]:
pulmonary vascular
redistribution.

Transthoracic ECHO [**2132-5-31**]:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with
anterior, antero-septal and apical akinesis. There is no
ventricular septal defect. with focal hypokinesis of the apical
free wall. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with history of CAD s/p recent
NSTEMI, chronic systolic CHF (EF 25%), DMII, HTN admitted to OSH
with decompensated CHF, and transferred here for cardiac
catheterization.

#CORONARIES: Patient transferred here for elective cardiac cath.
On [**2132-5-30**] only a right heart cath was performed given patient's
volume overload and left heart cath deferred pending diuresis.
Patient transferred to the CCU following procedure for
aggressive diuresis with lasix drip. Family and patient decided
not to go ahead with left heart cath. Troponins noted to be
elevated to 1.66 with a CK of only 15 in the setting of
worsening renal insufficiency. Patient did not have any episodes
of chest pain on admission. He was continued on aspirin and his
metoprolol was reduced from 75mg [**Hospital1 **] to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]. He will
follow up with his outpatient cardiologist following discharge.
.
#PUMP: Right heart cath demonstrated RA pressure of 15mmHg and
mean PCWP of 37mmHg. Patient transferred to the CCU following
cath and started on a lasix drip which he diuresed well to and
he now appears slightly more euvolemic. At time of discharge he
continues to have reduced breath sounds at both lung bases and
continues to have orthopnea. The patient and his family are in
agreement that he will return home with hospice rather than
staying in the hospital for additional diuresis. He will be
discharged on lasix 60 mg PO daily. This can be titrated up as
needed to improve his volume status. Lisinopril was increased
from 5mg daily to 10 mg daily. As noted above the dose of his
metoprolol was decreased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **]. As noted above, he has
follow up scheduled with his oupatient cardiologist.
.
#RHYTHM: No active issues. Patient remained in sinus rhythm and
was monitored on telemetry which did not show any events.

#Renal insufficiency: Cr increased to 1.5-1.7 on admission
likely in the setting of heart failure exacerbation and poor
forward flow. Cr is at a baseline of 1.4 at time of admission.

#DM type II: Blood sugars remained stable. Glipizide was held as
an inpatient and he was continued on a humalog sliding scale.
Glipizide should be restarted follo
