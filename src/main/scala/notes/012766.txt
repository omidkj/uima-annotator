Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14145**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Cardiac catherization
2.  Valvuloplasty

History of Present Illness:
This is an 85-year-old woman with a history of CAD s/p multiple
interventions (total of 10 stents), recent cath for DOE in [**2160**],
severe aortic valve stenosis and mitral regurgitation who
presents to [**Hospital1 18**] for dyspnea at rest and precordial chest
pressure.  Patient states that dyspnea has been increasing for
the last 5 weeks and came to a crescendo night prior to
admission; patient was was unable to lie down and was tripoding
against the wall in order to get in enough air.  Also relates
history of pressure in middle of her chest, which was constant.
Oxygen requirement at home is 3LPM.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 12167**] is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient and was
going to be evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of CT surgery for double
valve repair.  Recent ECHO shows aortic pullback, AS gradient
25, area 0.74, significant mitral regurgitation, and bad
pulmonary hypertention.
.
In the ED, patient was put on a non-rebreater and titrated down
to 4LPM.  Her initial vitals were BP: 120/70, HR: 75, SP02: 97%
on 4lpm.  She was slightly uncomfortable and could not lie flat.
 A CXR was consistent with heart failure and a possible
consolidation in the left lower lobe.  Patient took her ASA and
Plavix morning of admission.

Past Medical History:
--CAD s/p numerous cardiac catherizations, most recent in [**2160**]
--HTN
--Hyperlipidemia
--Anxiety/depression
--Chronic back pain s/p fracture
--Osteoporosis
--Breast cancer s/p bilateral mastectomy and chemotherapy (no
radiation)

CT CHEST [**2161-3-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild interstitial edema. Bilateral pleural effusions with
adjacent
atelectasis.
2. Cardiomegaly.
3. Severe calcification of the aortic valve and coronary
arteries.
4. Minimal calcifications in the aortic arch.
5. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive.
6. Prominent main pulmonary artery suggests pulmonary
hypertension.
7. Sequela of granulomatous infection.
.
ECHO [**2161-3-7**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.7 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with mild regional systoic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Severe calcific aortic stenosis. Mild
aortic regurgitation. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation
with a substantially calcified mitral annulus. At least mild
pulmonary hypertension.
.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2160-2-8**], mitral regurgitation severity may have
increased. The other findings appear similar..
.
CAROTID ULTRASOUND [**2161-3-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. 60-69% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
2. Less than 40% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
.
ECHO post-valvuloplasty [**3-12**]:
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.  There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-7**], the
degree of aortic regurgitation is similar. The degree of aortic
stenosis has also decreased. Calculation of aortic valve area
cannot be done as LVOT velocities were not measured.
.
CXR [**2161-3-20**]:
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged in appearance. Marked
improved aeration in the left lower lobe with only minimal
residual atelectasis remaining. Left hemidiaphragm remains
elevated, with adjacent gastric distension in the left upper
quadrant.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 85-year-old female with severe AS, CAD, MR who
presents with worsening SOB and chest pain.

# AORTIC STENOSIS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 12167**] presents with acute on chronic
systolic heart failure in the setting of severe aortic stenosis.
 At first a aortic valve repair was planned, but the procedure
was considered too risky in a patient with such high right-sided
filling pressures and other comorbidities.  (She did however
complete a full work-up for CT surgery including cardiac cath,
dental consult, panorex, carotid and cardiac ultrasounds).  Ms.
[**Known lastname 12167**] was put on a gentle lasix drip in order to improve
respirtory status without compromising preload.  Eventually, Ms.
[**Known lastname 12167**] went for an aortic valvuloplasty via catherization.  The
procedure was successful and a post-valvuloplasty ECHO showed
lessening of degree of aortic stenosis.  However, on the day
following her valvuloplasty, the patient developed worsening
shortness of breath.  She was given bolus lasix but still
remained hypoxic, requiring a non-rebreather.  She was
transferred to the CCU further further evaluation and
management. In the CCU, she was noted to have a tenuous fluid
status. Her antihypertensives were held due to hypotension.  She
was diuresed intermittently with a lasix
