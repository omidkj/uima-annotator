##Cardiac
CAD - Initially patient continued on ASA, and heparin (goal
50-70) given bleeding diathesis after thrombolytics.  No
GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor was used.  No plavix given upcoming cath
and possibility of surgical management.
  - Also started on Lipitor 80 mg po qd, beta blocker
(metoprolol) and captopril
  - Patient markedly hypertensive (SBP 160) on arrival -
received IV NTG gtt for pressure control which was weaned off
and ACEI and BB titrated up appropriately.
Peak CK ~3392.
- Pt under went a cardiac cath which revealed LAD lesion which
was stented with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
.
Pump - no previous estimates of heart function.  No signs of
heart failure on exam. Echo done post cath with EF 35%.  Given
EF of 35% and apical, inferior and lateral apical akinesis pt
started on coumadin for likely 3 month course.  D/C home with
