Service:  Cardiology

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
woman with a history of dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy who
had been in her usual good state of health.  She went to a
wedding on [**Hospital3 **].  Following this she had dizziness while
sitting down.  She had no pain.  She took a sublingual
nitroglycerin tablet and felt worse, diaphoretic, and went to
[**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital via Emergency Medical Service.  She was
asymptomatic by arrival to their Emergency Room.  She
experienced no pain during any of this.  While at [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital on telemetry she had a run of wide complex
tachycardia associated with hypotension to a systolic blood
pressure of 80s.  She was started on intravenous amiodarone
and planned for transfer to [**Hospital1 188**].  She did not have recurrence of the tachycardia after
the amiodarone was started.  She did, however, have
bradycardia to a heart rate in the 40s and hypotension again
to a systolic blood pressure in the 80s.  Amiodarone
intravenously was given at 1 mg per minute from 1430 to 2230
on [**2164-8-26**].  Amiodarone at 0.5 mg per minute was
given from 2230 until arrival at [**Hospital1 190**] at midnight when the bottle broke on transfer.
She has had some increased of shortness of breath with
exertion over the past two months as well as a cold which has
totally resolved.  She denied headache, chest pain,
orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, pedal edema,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria or back pain.  She
gets short of breath at one flight of stairs but is able to
work out for 10 minutes on a stationary bike.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Previous medical history is
significant for)
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction in [**2159**], complicated by cardiogenic shock.
2.  Status post cardiac catheterization in [**2159**] with a normal
right coronary artery, 70% proximal left anterior descending
artery, 100% middle left anterior descending artery, a normal
left circumflex, and diffuse second obtuse marginal.
3.  Cardiac stress test in [**2162-8-27**] with large fixed
abnormalities involving anterior wall, lateral wall near the
cardiac apex and sputum, mild reversible abnormality of the
inferior wall, marked ventricular chamber dilatation with
global diffuse hypokinesis and decreased ejection fraction
of 13%.
4.  Hypothyroidism.
5.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy.
6.  Peptic ulcer disease with a history of bleeding; last
bleeding was greater than 30 years ago.
7.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; echocardiogram on
[**2164-7-17**], revealed left ventricular ejection fraction
of 10%, depressed right ventricular ejection fraction, 1+
mitral regurgitation, trace aortic insufficiency, entire
intraventricular septum and anterior wall were thin, fibrotic
and akinetic, apex was frankly dyskinetic; all other segments
of the left ventricle were severely hypokinetic and extensive
spontaneous echocontrast throughout the left ventricular
cavity consistent with an old mural thrombus.
8.  Glaucoma.
9.  Hepatitis (unclear type).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her medications at home include
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.,
Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.,
digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. (held on admission), Coumadin 3 mg
p.o. q.d. (held on admission), amiodarone 200 mg p.o. on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday (was admitted on intravenous
amiodarone at 0.5 mg per minute), Synthroid 75 mcg p.o. q.d.,
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Zestril 20 mg p.o. q.d., Timoptic 0.5%
OU q.h.s., Lovenox 50 mg p.o. q.12h.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is widowed.  Formerly worked
managing a law firm, but retired at age 55.  Lives in
apartment at [**Hospital1 **] Community Center in [**Location (un) 745**].  Works out on
machines, 10 minutes on a stationary bike.  Smoked an unclear
amount from 17 until 52.  Never a serious drinker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  On examination, the
patient was comfortable, wearing lipstick, talking on the
phone.  Temperature 98, heart rate 54, blood pressure 103/49,
respiratory rate 19, saturating 96% on 2 liters.  Her eyes
were anicteric.  Extraocular muscles were intact.  Moist
mucous membranes without lesions.  Neck was supple.  Jugular
venous distention was observed at 6 cm.  On heart
examination, there was a dyskinetic point of maximal impulse
laterally displaced.  Rate was regular, soft S4, soft
holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Examination of the lungs
revealed crackles one-quarter of the way up.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended, normal active bowel
sounds.  No organomegaly by examination.  Extremities
revealed no edema, and 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:   Laboratories on admission
were significant for a hematocrit of 34.1, with a MCV of 88.
An albumin of 3.6.  Chemistry of 9.  An INR of 3.4, and
digoxin level of 1.3.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Her electrocardiogram showed somewhat
broad complex tachycardia at 130 msec, QRS of right
bundle-branch block type, RS complex was absent in all
precordial leads with Q waves across the precordium.  Also in
lead II probable AD disassociation.

Her electrocardiogram on arrival at [**Hospital1 190**] showed normal sinus rhythm with a long P-R,
slightly broad QRS, poor R wave progression, and a left axis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted with probable
ventricular tachycardia or accelerated idioventricular rhythm
and was referred to the Electrophysiology Service for
evaluation.
