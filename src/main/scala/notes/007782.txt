HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old
gentleman transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] with a large
cerebellar bleed.  The patient was at work, complained of a
headache and then became unresponsive at 11:00 the night
before admission.  He had a traumatic intubation at [**Hospital6 3622**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unknown except for hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol.
2.  Lisinopril.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a restaurant worker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.8.  Blood pressure
145/75.  Heart rate 47.  Respiratory rate 14.  100% sats, the
patient was intubated.  Neurological examination pupils were
pinpoint.  His lungs were clear to auscultation.  Cardiac
status regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Skin no rashes.  He was on
Fentanyl on admission and Norcuron on admission.  He did not
respond to painful stimuli.

His CT showed a 5 cm right cerebellar bleed with blood in the
lateral ventricles.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the Neurological
Intensive Care Unit where he was then taken emergently to the
Operating Room for evacuation of this cerebellar clot.  The
patient had a vent drain placed before going to the Operating
Room.  Postoperatively, he was intubated, but awake and
attentive.  Pupils were 4 down to 3 mm.  The left was
slightly larger then the right.  He localized with both his
right and left upper extremity and withdrew his lower
extremities to pain.  He was on Nipride to keep his blood
pressure less then 150.  Attempted extubation on the patient
on [**2194-6-6**], which he failed and was reintubated.  On [**2194-6-9**] the patient opened his eyes to stimulation.  His
pupils were 3 down to 2 mm.  Left was still slightly larger
then the right.  He localized his upper extremities and
withdrew his lower extremities.  He continued to have his
vent drain in place.  He was continued to be vented.  On [**6-10**]
he spiked a temperature to 101.3.  His sputum showed gram
negative rods and his cerebral spinal fluid was pending.  He
received Oxacillin for drain prophylaxis and was started on
Levofloxacin for gram negative rods and his gram negative
Diplococci in his sputum.  On [**6-14**] the patient opened his
eyes.  He had localizing in the left upper extremity,
decreased movement in the right upper extremity, not
following commands and withdrawing his lower extremities.
Repeat head CT at that time was unchanged.  The patient
continued on Oxacillin and Levofloxacin for gram negative
rods and his sputum and cerebral spinal fluid cultures have
been negative to date.  The patient was prepped for a trach
and PEG.  On [**2194-6-15**] the vent drain was clamped.  ICP was
transfused.  The patient's range was 15 to 20.  The patient
remained neurologically unchanged with drain clamped.  The
patient's staples were discontinued on [**2194-6-17**].  The drain
was discontinued on [**2194-6-16**].

The patient spiked a temperature to 101.9.  Cerebral spinal
fluid cultures were sent.  Sputum again was sent.  The
patient continued on Levofloxacin.  The Levofloxacin was
discontinued on [**2194-6-17**] and the patient was started on
Vancomycin and Zosyn for gram negative rods in the sputum.
Sputum from [**2194-6-17**] showed 2+ gram negative rods and 1+
gram positive cocci.  He was continued on Zosyn and
Vancomycin for pneumonia.  The patient did have left lower
lobe infiltrate by chest x-ray.  The patient at this point
was having intractable hiccups and was started on Thorazine
with good results.  The patient had a repeat head CT to
assess for hydrocephalus.  The patient's ventricles were not
dilated.  His head CT was stable.  He continued to remain the
same neurologically opening his eyes and being somewhat
attentive localizing in the left upper extremity, less so in
the right upper extremity, withdrawing his lower extremities.
His pupils were 4 down to 2 mm and brisk.  The patient was
trached on [**2194-6-17**].  He had PEG placed on [**2194-6-25**].  The
patient's condition remained stable and he was transferred to
the regular floor on [**2194-6-29**].  He was followed by physical
therapy and occupational therapy and found to acquire rehab.

1.  Atenolol 50 mg po q.d.

8.  Tylenol 650 po q 4 hours prn.
9.  Zosyn 2.25 grams intravenous q 8 hours for a total of 14
days for pneumonia.  The patient was started on Zosyn on
[**2194-6-21**].  Should continue to [**2194-7-5**].
10.  Hydralazine 25 mg po q.h.s. hold for systolic blood
pressure less then 130.
11.  Nifedipine 10 mg po q 6 hours hold for systolic blood
pressure less then 130.
12.  Lisinopril 20 mg po b.i.d. hold for systolic blood

Vital signs are stable.  The patient has been afebrile and
ready for transfer to rehab.  His condition is stable.  He
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] in one month with repeat head
