History of Present Illness:
HPI gleaned from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] notes and daugther since Pt is
intubated.
.
Pt is a 86 year old female w/ PMH of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who
complains of generalized malaise and weakness. According to
family she has had a six-month decline in her general function
including mobility, ability to communicate and mental status. At
baseline, she can transfer wheelchair to toilet with assistance
and some walking at home with physical therapy, but is "quite
confused".

According to the family, 2 days ago she had an episode of
hypoglycemia related to a insulin dose it was late in the
evening administered by her husband. Shortly afterwards, she
became combative and needed to be restrained by her son. They
called 911 and EMS found her blood sugars to be in the 40s. Her
mental status cleared after admin of D50 and glucagon.

Since that episode, she has had increased lethargy and weakness.
She has been refusing to get out of bed at all and she has been
moaning. No vomiting, no diarrhea, no fever. She did have
episode of incontinence however that was in the setting of not
getting out of bed. She always is a poor eater reported to
family however she's had much nothing to eat for the last 24
hours. Her husband states her blood sugars have been normal and
has been giving her her insulin as usual the last couple of
days.

Pt was brought to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED for evaluation by family for
continued "moaning" and reduced responsiveness. At BIDN, initial
vitals were Temp: 100.6 HR: 98 BP: 120/46 Resp: 20 O(2)Sat: 94.
Pt complained of L chest pain and R wrist pain. Troponins were
negative, no concerning ECG changes. Plain CXR did not show any
fractures of the chest or R wrist. Pt's lipase was elevated to
[**2122**] and Pt developed a fever to 102F. She had a CT abdomen w/
contrast, which showed a common bile duct dilated to 2.8 cm w/
multiple stones and a question of obstructing ampullary stone.
Plan was made to transfer Pt to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] for ERCP, and Pt
received a dose of Zosyn.

Before transport, the patient became unstable with SBP in 70's.
She was given 2L IVF and her BP remained low, and she was
started on peripheral levophed. [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED placed a R IJ
without complications, however she developed hypoxia just
afterwards and needed to be intubated for airway control. She
was intubated on second attempt with a 7.0 ETT. Her ETT and CVL
appear to be in correct position on CXR and [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] feels
she may have developed ARDS. Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 86**] ED.
.
In the [**Hospital1 **] [**Name (NI) 86**] [**Name (NI) **], Pt was stable. CXR showed diffuse
bilateral infiltrates R > L and blunting of R costophrenic
angle, ?ARDS. Pt was on midaz/fent. On norepi 0.21. IJ + 2PIVs.
Received a dose of Vanc. Vent settings on transfer were FiO2 50%
TV 420 RR 20 PEEP 5. Vitals were 76, 107/49, 98%. Pt was
finishing 6th liter of IVF.
.
On arrival to the ICU, Pt's vital signs were 37.2C, HR 73, BP
109/46, RR 17, Sat 100% on FiO2 50%, intubated and sedated.
.
Review of systems:  Unable to confirm due to intubation.
Per [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] records and daughter, Pt did not have fevers /
chills. No nausea or vomiting. No diarrhea. Reports malaise and
reduced appetite for several months, but especially so for the
last two days. No urinary symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo F w/ PMH diabetes, hypertension, ampullary stenosis s/p
sphincterotomy who presented with increasing lethargy, fevers,
and hypotension, found to have septic [**Month/Day/Year **] from likely
cholangitis and gallstone pancreatitis.

She initially appeared to respond well to ERCP and antibiotics,
initially coming down on pressors and appeared close to
extubation.  Then, however, her pressures began to drop and she
was put back on pressors.  Her mental status was poor, even off
sedation, and she persistently failed her spontaneous breathing
trials.  Leukocytosis and fevers increased, and it appeared her
sepsis and overall clinical status was worsening.  At this
point, her family felt that she would not want to continue with
this level of treatment if it did not appear she would return to
her baseline.  After a meeting with the entire family (including
daughter/HCP [**Doctor First Name 4134**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and the rest of the ICU
team, her care was transitioned to comfort focused care.  Her
pressors and antibiotics were stopped on [**2-4**], but she remained
intubated and ventillated, as the family did not want her to
feel air hunger.  She passed away peacefully with family at her
side at 4:05pm on [**2194-2-5**].  Please see below for more detailed
summary of main hospital problems.

PRIMARY PROBLEMS:
# [**Name2 (NI) 21020**]: Thought to be septic in nature [**2-27**] cholangitis.  Echo
showed significant multi-valve dysfunction, however there was no
evidence of cardiogenic component. Patient was intubated and
started on norepinephrine on arrival in the ICU. For source
control, she was sent to ERCP (see below) and started on empiric
vancomycin and zosyn. Blood pressure was originally reasonably
responsive to fluids, so patient was intermittently bolused and
weaned off pressors after 3 days. She then, however, began to
drop her pressures again requiring uptitration with pressors.
Leukocytosis increased and she developed new fevers, raising
concern for worsening of sepsis.  No new source identified,
nothing grew on blood or urine cultures. UOP decreased despite
maintenance of MAPs.  She began developing pleural effusions due
to administered fluid and leaky capillar
