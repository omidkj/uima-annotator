PSYCHIATRY CONSULTATION - INITIAL
STAFF

[**2129-6-18**]  1100

I have seen and examined the patient. Please see resident note
from Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 82838**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; I agree with their
history, findings, and plan of care as written.

Pt is a 52 yo F with reported history of bipolar disorder NOS
sent from her PCP's office for assessment of intoxication. Pt
reports taking two 10-mg methadone pills (which she obtained
from
a friend) prior to presentation, as well as an unknown amount of
alprazolam and at least 10 mg of diazepam. Pt acknowledges that
this was poor judgment, but cites recent social stresses as a
reason. She consistently and adamantly denied any intent to harm
herself and regrets her actions. She reports that she has been
more depressed recently, sleeping poorly, and out of psychiatric
treatment for about two months; she did, however, recently
schedule therapy and psychopharm appointments for the next two
weeks. Denies EtOH or other drugs. Somewhat self-blaming, but
not
hopeless or helpless. No paranoia, increased energy,
hallucinations, or delusional thought content. Additional
history
obtained from family per Dr.[**Name (NI) 82839**] note. On further ROS she has
no chest pain or SOB. On exam, she is alert, generally
cooperative, with a "depressed" mood and an occasionally labile
affect. No SI/HI/AH/VH. TP linear. No delusions elicited. Speech
clear. No tremors. Oriented x3. MOYB intact with mild
hesitation.
[**Name (NI) **] screen positive for methadone and benzodiazepines only.

While she has exercised poor judgment in her abuse of
sedative-hypnotics as well as methadone, there are no signs from
the history or exam of any deliberate intent to harm or kill
herself. While mildly dysphoric and labile, there are no clear
signs of a major depressive syndrome, psychosis, (hypo-)mania,
or
panic at this time. She has a mild impairment in attention,
which
can be attributed to residual effects from her overdose, though
from a cognitive standpoint she is lucid overall. At this time
there are no signs of opiate or benzodiazepine withdrawal.

I have recommended psychiatric (dual-diagnosis) admission for
further evaluation and stabilization. But, she has refused and
does not meet criteria for involuntary hospitalization. She
feels
safe (and agrees to) follow up with her outpatient appointments
as follows:

- Therapy: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 82840**], LICSW [**2129-6-28**] 10:15 AM at [**Location (un) 6138**]
Counselling in [**Location (un) 5503**], MA.

- Psychopharm: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 82841**] [**2129-7-6**] 11:30 AM [**Location (un) 86**] Behavioral,
[**Street Address(1) 82842**], [**Location (un) 5503**], MA.

While admitted, there is no ostensible need for a 1:1. I
recommend monitoring for benzodiazepine withdrawal and covering
with lorazepam as needed. Would defer beginning further
psychiatric medications until she has established ongoing care
as
an outpatient.
