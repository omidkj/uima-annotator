History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, HTN,
and chronic renal insufficiency with recent complicated history
(see below in PMH) who presents from rehab with altered mental
status, fever, and respiratory distress. The patient was
discharged from our MICU yesterday afternoon. At [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
last night, his wife reports that he was more oriented and able
to converse, though he was speaking in a whisper. He did not
appear in respiratory distress at that time. This morning, the
staff at the rehab noted increased somnolence and respiratory
rate (28-32). He also had increased nasal congestion and they
were able to suction thick secretions from his airway. Oxygen
saturation noted to be 83-89% on 1.5 L NC and Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a
temperature of 99.5 degrees. They contact[**Name (NI) **] EMS to bring him to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ER at that time for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 104.2 (rectal), HR 110s-120s,
BP 135/80, RR 20, 100% on NRB. The patient was intubated due to
respiratory distress and inability to protect his airway.
Intubation with etomidate/succ was difficult and involved help
of Anesthesia and glidescope; the ED team noted thick, yellow
secretions immediately post-intubation with suctioning of the ET
tube. He then received 2 mg versed and 10 mg vecuronium .
Post-intubation he became hypotensive to the 70s systolic and
was started on levophed gtt. He had a R IJ CVL placed. He
underwent CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis in order to
determine a source of infection. He was treated with vancomcyin
and zosyn as well as 1 g tylenol PR. His 3rd liter of NS was
hanging as he was transferred to the ICU.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient is intubated and sedated. He
is not opening eyes to voice.
