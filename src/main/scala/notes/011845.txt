History of Present Illness:
54 yo F with history of type 1 DM, severe gastroparesis, HTN,
Grave's Ds and Hep C, presents with DKA for second time in 3
weeks. Patient was admitted at the end of [**Month (only) **] with
hyperglycemia and an anion gap acidosis in the setting of a
cough and fevers. She was discharged to home and in the last
several days noticed her blood sugars running high, this time
unaccompanied by fevers/coughing. She admits to +n/v and
abdominal pain. Before her electrolytes came back, she was
treated in the ED with three doses of Humalog. Once it was
evident that she had a gap acidosis, an insulin gtt was
initiated. Vitals in the ED were T 98.8, HR 125, BP 130/66, RR
16, Sats 100% RA.
Although she had no obvious focus of infection, blood cultures
and UA were sent and CXR ordered.
She was sent to the MICU for further management of DKA while on
an insulin gtt.
.
In the MICU, the patient is currently [**Month (only) **] non-bloody
bilious emesis, requiring a dose of zofran IV. She denies
SOB/CP, cough, dysuria, f/c's. No diarrhea. She admits to
abdominal pain, similar to her chronic gastroparesis pain, but
more severe. Patient claims she was taking all of her insulin as
directed.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo woman h/o type 1 DM w/ gastroparesis and neuropathy, HTN,
Hep C presents with DKA (initial Glc 777, AG 33) and fevers,
nausea, [**Month/Day/Year **] (nonbloody), worsening gastroparesis pain and
nonproductive cough.  In the MICU, patient was placed on insulin
drip.  She was restarted on lower dose lantus and placed on her
outpatient sliding scale.  She was tolerating meals well and her
abdominal pain was improved.
.
1. Diabetes Melitus: On admission she was in DKA based on AG of
29, ketones in urine and Glc of 608 in ED. She reported
compliance w/ home insulin. ECG was unchanged from previous. She
had no f/c or leukocytosis. Alternatively worsened gastroparesis
with nausea, vomitting and abdominal pain also possible. Initial
UA and blood cultures were negative. Initial urine culture grew
gardnerella vaginalis. Subsequent UA equivocal with < [**2125**] GNR's
on culture. Final UA also equivocal but culture grew >100,000
e.coli (pan-sensitive) which developed with catheter in place so
treated with 1 week of ciprofloxacin. CXR unremarkable. One set
of blood cultures grew coag neg staph but subsequent cultures
were negative at the time of discharge so this was thought to be
a contaminant. Last A1c in [**3-26**] was 6.0, markedly elevated on
last admission to 10. In the MICU she was treated with an
insulin drip and electrolyte repletion. She was stabilized on
this, gap was closed, she was transferred to the floor, and
initially started on less than normal dose lantus with sliding
scale. She had fair glycemic control and was tolerating food.
She was discharged to resume her home dose of insulin (20 units
glargine twice daily, with humalog sliding scale. [**Last Name (un) **]
followed her in house and she will follow-up with them as an
outpatient. She was continued on reglan for gastroparesis.

2 Gastroparesis: She had nausea, [**Last Name (un) **] and abdominal pain on
presentation thought secondary to her diabetic gastroparesis
with no clear infectious process presenting itself. This was
controlled and she resumed home reglan.

3 Urinary tract infection: Noted after foley catheter placed in
MICU. She was started on cipro for pan-sensitive e.coli for a 7
day course, started [**1-9**]. She should have a repeat UA and
culture once she has completed the antibiotics.

4 Coag negative staph in blood cultures: Not present on initial
cultures or subquent surveillance cultures. Thought to be a
contaminant given lack of signs or symptoms of infection.

5 Acute Renal Failure: Normal On arrival creatinine was elevated
to 1.4. This improved to 0.9 with hydration so was thought to be
prerenal given dehydration. This did not recur during her
hospital course.

6 Headache: She has a history of migraine headaches and
developed unilateral pain typical of her usual migraine pain in
house. This was treated with morphine and tylenol in house and
resolved.

7 Leukopenia: She develped mild leukopenia, with a WBC count of
3.7 on discharge. She has had leukopenia to this level in the
past and will need follow-up with her PCP to have this repeated
and further evaluated as an outpatient.

8 Hypertension: She was noted to develop hypertension in the
MICU so was restarted on her losartan with excellent hemodynamic
control by the time of discharge.

9 History of Anemia: Baseline high 20's, normocytic, iron
studies suggestive of AOCD. At baseline on discharge.

10 Asthma: She was continuted on inhalers in house but no
ev
