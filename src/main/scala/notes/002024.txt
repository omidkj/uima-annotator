Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent the above procedure.  For full details
please see the separately dictated operative note.  The patient
progressed well post-operatively.  She was kept on bedrest with
the head of bed flat for 48 hours postoperatively due to dural
tear that was repaired.  A drain was utilized and was d/c'ed
when output had tapered down.  Peri-operative antibiotics were
utilized for 24 hrs.  Post-operative pain was controlled with IV
followed by PO medications.  Diet was advanced without
complication.  Physical therapy was consulted for assistance
with mobilization.

During PT, patient had syncopal episode.  Complete workup
revealed no evidence of cardiac compromise (normal enzymes,
EKG).  CT chest revealed subsegmental PE.  Medicine was
consulted and recommended treatment with 3 months of
anticoagulation.

Patient was begun on coumadin bridged by heparain gtt.  Once she
was therapeutic, heparin was discontinued and patient was
maintained on coumadin with goal INR [**3-20**].  Given her complicated
post-operative course, she was deemed most appropriate for
transfer to an extended care facility.  INR should be closely
monitored and coumadin adjusted to the target range, and PT
should be continued at the facility.
