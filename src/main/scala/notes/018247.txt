History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old gentleman with multiple medical
problems, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after a hospital stay
for CHF exacerbation and aspiration pneumonia, who presented
from rehab with increasing lethargy.  Pt. was noted to be
"obtunded" at rehab facility on day of admission and ABG was
performed which was consistent with hypercarbic and hypoxemic
respiratory failure (7.25/96/26).  Intubation was attempted at
rehab without success.  Pt. was also noted to be hypothermic
(T=94F) and was given 1 gram of IV vancomycin and 1 gram of IV
unasyn prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. He was also given
100mg of IV lasix before transfer.
In the ED, the pt. was noted to be tachypneic with respiratory
rate in the upper 20's and ABG on presentation was 7.31/87/130.
He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation shortly
after presentation.  He received a dose of levofloxacin and
metronidazole for presumed aspiration pneumonia. He was also
given a total of 2 liters of IV fluid and 40mg of IV lasix to
which he put out approximately 800 cc of urine.
According to the pt's. daughter, the pt. had been increasingly
confused and lethargic for three to four days PTA.  She also
noted that his lasix dose had been recently reduced as it was
felt that the pt. was "dry."
Upon presentation to the MICU, the pt. was intubated and
sedated.

HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMdry, ETT in place
Neck: C-collar in place
Pulmonary: coarse breath sounds bilaterally
Cardiac: RRR, S1S2, V/VI (+parasternal heave) HSM at LSB to
axilla
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, hypoactive bowel sounds, no masses noted,

Pertinent Results:
Labs on Admission:

EKG: NSR at 66bpm, LAD, LBBB, no ST-T changes noted

CXR: bilateral pleural effusions, marked cardiomegaly, perihilar
haziness, apparent worsening of CHF in interval since [**12-3**]

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory failure:  Multifactorial and due to CHF
exacerbation with possible aspiration event. ABG on admission
c/w compensated chronic respiratory acidosis, improved with
ventilatory support.

2. Hypotension: Differential includes sepsis vs. cardiogenic
shock. The patient was maintained on pressors during his stay in
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

3. Axis (C2) fx.: maintain hard collar at all times, pt. has f/u
with orthopaedics in early [**Month (only) 404**].

4. CAD: continue ASA

5. Comm: Daughter [**Name (NI) 2155**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 110927**], son Dr. [**Known lastname 8993**]
(internist, pg. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 110930**])

6. Care plan: The paitne was clearly in pain and without a good
prognosis given his aspiration risk and his C2 fracture. The
family relied on the primary team and the ethics consult service
for guidance in planning for Mr. [**Known lastname 110931**] care. In addition, Mr.
[**Known lastname 8993**] had expressed to his wife the desire to not have his life
prolonged by "machines". He was made CMO on [**2184-1-30**] and placed
on a T-piece while still intubated. The patient passed away at
10:30 [**2184-1-31**]. Post-mortum was declined.
