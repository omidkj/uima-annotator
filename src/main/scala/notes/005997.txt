CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and tachypnea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old man
with an extensive past medical history including congestive
heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%, severe
human immunodeficiency virus who presented with shortness of
breath and tachypnea.

The patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2-27**] to [**Hospital1 **], at which
time he also presented with worsening dyspnea that was
attributed to congestive heart failure and treated with Lasix
avium-intracellulare in his sputum that was treated with
ethambutol, floxacillin, and azithromycin.  Additionally, he
had pseudomonas positive wound culture and was
treated between [**2-21**] and [**3-2**].

Today, he was sent from [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation of shortness
of breath and increased respiratory rate for the last two
days.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   His review of systems was positive for a
temperature spike up to 101.4 on [**3-7**], and urinalysis was
positive for infection, treated with levofloxacin.  On
admission, the patient denied chest pain, cough, nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea.  By report, chest x-ray was post for
edema and congestive heart failure, and the patient was
treated with Lasix earlier in the morning prior to admission.

While in the Emergency Department BiPAP was attempted without
much success.

syndrome with a CD4 count of 248 in [**2172-1-10**] and a
viral load of less than 50.
15.  Pulmonary aspergillosis in [**2161**].
16.  Vitamin B12 and iron deficiency anemia.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN, NIFEDIPINE, QUINIDINE, PROCAINAMIDE,
DILTIAZEM, ACE INHIBITOR, and HYDRALAZINE.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his daughter ([**Name (NI) **])
who is health care proxy.  [**Name (NI) **] reports no alcohol and a 100 to
150-pack-year tobacco smoking history.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Combivir, nevirapine, vitamin C,
Neurontin, Atrovent, albuterol, Procrit, Pravachol, Flovent,
Ultrase, Bactrim, Fentanyl, Cozaar, subcutaneous heparin,
lactulose, digoxin, Risperdal, tube feeds, Fentanyl patch 25,
Flovent, Combivent, zinc, Protonix, Zocor, Mirapex,
oxycodone, Sinemet.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed
temperature of 100.8 rectally, respiratory rate of 30s to
40s, heart rate of 85, blood pressure of 122 to 181/35 to 48.
Generally, the patient was barely responsive to tactile
stimulation, laboring with his breathing.  Head, ears, nose,
eyes and throat revealed pupils were round and reactive to
light.  Pulmonary revealed there were bilateral crackles and
rhonchi.  The patient was using accessory muscles with
ambulation.  Cardiovascular revealed hyperdynamic heart.  No
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen was nontender and
nondistended, with G-tube in site.  Rectal was brown, which
was heme-positive.  Extremities showed trace pretibial edema.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram was paced at 83.

Chest x-ray revealed congestive heart failure with pulmonary
edema,  bilateral opacities (possibly edema of aspiration
pneumonia), emphysema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories at
[**Hospital1 **] revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 (with a
differential of 52 neutrophils, 31 lymphocytes, and
4.9 eosinophils), hematocrit of 27.1 (down from a baseline of
approximately 26), platelet count of 322, mean cell volume
of 127, and an RDW of 23.4.  Digoxin level of 1.7.  INR
of 1.2, PTT of 32.7.  Sodium of 137, potassium of 5.4,
chloride of 97, bicarbonate 38, blood urea nitrogen of 45,
creatinine of 0.8, glucose of 101.  Amylase of 86, lipase
of 65, albumin was pending, calcium of 7.9, total bilirubin
of 0.4, ALT of 35, AST of 54, alkaline phosphatase of 101,
LDH of 239.  Urinalysis was cloudy, trace blood, 5 to 10
white blood cells, 1+ leukocyte esterase.  Arterial blood gas
at 1:45 was 7.26/90/286 on 100% nonrebreather; at 2:40 was
7.33/75/56 on 2 liters, satting 89%; at 4:50 was 7.21/97/164
on 3 liters, satting 100% on BiPAP of 10 X 5 and 30% oxygen.
His systolic blood pressure increased to 220, and his
respiratory rate decreased to 50s, with a decrease in his
oxygen saturation.  Arterial blood gas at 6:20 p.m. showed
7.24/88/50, satting 88% on 2 liters.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   In summary, the patient is an 82-year-old
with multiple medical problems including acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome, congestive heart failure (with an
ejection fraction of 30%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease who came in with severe respiratory distress,
bilateral infiltrates, and hypercarbia, with mild hypoxia,
and fever.

After an extensive discussion with the daughter, the patient's
code status was changed to do not resuscitate/do not intubate. He
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further
monitoring.

Overnight, his respiratory status deteriorated leading to a
progressive increase in his blood pressure.  The patient
received 1 unit of packed red blood cells for his hematocrit
of 27, as well as antibiotics for pneumonia.  Despite this
supportive care, the patient passed away at 4:10 in the
morning on [**2172-3-9**].  The immediate cause of death was
respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, congestive heart
failure.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Deceased.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Human immunodeficiency virus.
3.  Pneumonia.
4.  Peptic ulcer disease.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  Peripheral vascular disease.
7.  Anemia.
