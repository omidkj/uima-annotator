Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation; terminal extubation

History of Present Illness:
78 y/o F with hx of CHF, AS, non-hodgkin's lymphoma who presents
from her home after her husband found her having agonal
breathing in the middle of the night. She is on coumadin and her
INR was 2.8. She was taken to an OSH and intubated. At the OSH,
she had a CT head that showed a large posterior fossa cerebellar
hemorrhage with surrounding edema and herniation. Neurosurgery
was consulted and thought surgical intervention was not
indicated. Given her poor prognosis, her family made her CMO
(though intubated). Plan was to admit the patient for continued
comfort care until all family members arrived. VS upon transfer
125/75, 130s, 23, 100% cpap 30% 5/5. Physical exam notable for
posturing and absent corneal reflexes.
.
On the floor, she is intubated and non-responsive. She has been
made CMO by her family. They are currently at the bedside
waiting for the priest to arrive prior to extubation.

CT Head:
FINDINGS: A large parenchymal hemorrhage extends from the
cerebellar vermis superiorly via the midbrain to involve the
thalami bilaterally. There is surrounding edema relating to both
the supra- and infratentorial components of the hemorrhage, and
perhaps slightly more extensive than was noted on the prior
study within the right thalamic region. The size and
configuration of the hemorrhage is similar to the previous
study, measuring 6.3 cm (AP) x 4.5 cm (TRV) x 5.5 cm (SI). There
is a large amount of intraventricular blood in the lateral
ventricles, opacifying the third and fourth ventricles, and
extending through the foramina of Luschka bilaterally.
Obliteration of the quadrigeminal plate cistern is consistent
with upward transtentorial herniation. In addition, there is
mild tonsillar herniation into the foramen magnum. Enlargement
of the ventricles is similar to the previous study.

The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
normally
pneumatized and aerated. Vascular calcifications involve the
internal carotid arteries bilaterally. There are no concerning
osseous lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large cerebellar vermian region hemorrhage extending
superiorly to the
level of the thalami, with a large amount of intraventricular
blood and
hydrocephalus. Enlargement of the ventricles. The quantity of
intracranial
hemorrhage is similar to the prior study. Parenchymal edema
surrounding the hemorrhage has increased slightly from the prior
study- see above report regarding this latter finding.
2. Upward transtentorial herniation and tonsillar herniation
through the
foramen magnum.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo F with complex past medical history, admitted after being
found with obtunded with agonal breathing overnight, found to
have a large intracranial hemorrhage with evidence of
herniation.
# ICH: Imaging as above, ED exam concerning for no cornea, no
gag, no withdrawl to pain, decerbrate on L arm, extensor in
extremities, pupils nonreactive. Neurosurgery has had extensive
conversation with the family about her poor prognosis.  Patient
was made comfort measures only and terminally extubated with the
family by her side.  She received an ativan and morphine gtt and
expired 15 minutes after extubation.  Her family was at the
bedside.  Autopsy was declined by the family and by the medical
examiner.
