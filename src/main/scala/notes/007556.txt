Chief Complaint:
here for TIPs eval

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p failed TIPs on [**2161-1-20**]


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, the patient is a 58 y/o F with cirrhosis likely,
secondary to sarcoidosis, c/b esophageal varices who presents
for direct admission for TIPS evaluation.  The pt was recently
admitted from [**Date range (1) 35603**] for TIPS eval s/p episode of
hematemesis with banding at an OSH. She became febrile during
that admission and there was concern that she had endocarditis
so she was started on vancomycin and was to complete at least a
6 week course.  Additionally developed R swollen leg and was
found to have abscesses along the muscle of the R thigh. Several
of these were drained by IR and a pigtail catheter was placed in
her leg. TIPS procedure was not done at that admission because
of concern for endocarditis. She was discharged with
instructions to continue vancomycin for at least 6 weeks until
she was either re-admitted to the hospital for TIPs or was seen
by ID.  She stopped her vancomycin on [**2161-1-12**] and was directly
admitted to the hospital on [**2161-1-13**].  She states that in the
interval between her hospitalizations she has been doing well
and thinks her right thigh is improving. The pigtail catheter
was removed as an outpatient. She is able to walk around more
than she was able to before, but still feels very tired.  She
also notes she was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and had additional banding
of her varices. She denies N/V, fevers, chills, diarrhea,
urinary symptoms or confusion. She did have some abdominal pain
yesterday but thinks it was [**1-22**] to having to sit up during her 5
hour car ride from [**State 1727**].  The pain has since resolved.

2. Portal vein thrombosis, as described above.

3. Evaluation of hepatic arterial supply is limited due to
non-breath-hold technique. However, prior abdominal CT scans
demonstrate conventional hepatic arterial anatomy.

4. Right-sided effusion, ascites and evidence of portal

Evaluation of the reformatted images on a separate workstation
were valuable in delineating the anatomy.
