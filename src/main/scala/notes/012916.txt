Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 293**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute on chronic renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
66 yo female with a very extensive past medical history
including severe AS, ESRD s/p cadaveric renal transplant in
[**2153**],   stage IV NASH cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, ascites,
encephalopathy, grade I-II esophageal varices s/p banding s/p
TIPS [**8-/2152**], s/p OLTx [**2153-7-21**], presenting from OSH with
worsening anemia and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.

Pt was initially on [**Female First Name (un) **] psych service at [**Hospital3 5097**] for ECT. She
was noted to have bruising on her abdomen and bloody lips. Lips
thought to be [**3-11**] biting but due to abdominal ecchomyses a Hct
was checked and found to be down (28.2). Transferred to medical
floor where further labs revealed Creatinine 3.4 (elevated) and
WBC 11.7.  Medical team was initially concerned about DIC,
however fibrinogen was 551 and D-Dimer was 1.08/plt 404K, and
INR was 1.2.  Bleeding of her lip was thought to be attributed
to self induced trauma.
Given her renal failure, intial workup showed a positive UA
growing GNRs.  She was started on levofloxacin on [**2156-10-10**],
switched to fosfomycin due to her cultures growing ESBL
presumably resistant to FQ's.  With her HCT drop, she was
guiaced reportedly several times, all which were negative.  She
had a Renal US which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis or
lithiasis in either kidney.  Her txplt kidney was 11 cm with no
evidence of hydroneprhosis.  Given her new worsening renal
failure, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care and
potential renal biopsy.

CXR [**2156-10-13**]:
Mild pulmonary edema, as manifested by an increase of
interstitial
markings and a slight increase in diameter of the pulmonary
vessels.  No evidence of consolidations suggesting pneumonia.
No parenchymal opacities. No pleural effusions, no pneumothorax.
 The pacer leads are in unchanged position.

TTE [**2156-10-14**]:
- Peak Ao grad 39, mean grad 20, peak velocity 3.1, Ao area 1.1
cm2
-There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF = 35 %)
secondary to extensive severe apical hypokinesis/akinesis with
focal dyskinesis. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with depressed free wall contractility. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
