Chief Complaint:
GIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
insertion of central line

History of Present Illness:
(of note, history obtained from sister)
62yoM with extensive past medical hx, significant for Esophageal
strictures with frequent dilations, hx of GIB, cerebral palsy,
seizure disorder. He underwent aggressive (per the sister)
dilation to 24FR 8days ago. He has been undergoing q 2 week
dilations since the beginning of [**Month (only) 404**]. After the dilation,
streaks of red blood were noted in his G-J tube, which is common
after his dilations. Flushing would lead to more blood, but it
would stop by itself. 3 [**Known lastname **] prior to his presentation, the
sister reports that the patient did have some diffuse abdominal
pain. This pain is common for the patient, who struggles with
gas/constipation. he did have worsening pain this am, so his G
tube was vented and coffee ground emesis came out. They went to
OSH, where 300cc of coffee ground emesis was removed by NG
lavage and the patient wsa given pantoprazole bolus. At the OSH,
his Hct was 41. The patinet was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], where
his hematocrit was 35.  A foley bag was placed on his G tube and
250cc were drained. In the ED, he winced to abdominal palpation.
The patient is not on anticoagulation or antiplatelet
medications.
.
Of note, the patient has had an extensive history of esophageal
dilations and [**Hospital1 15532**]'s esophagus, thought to be secondary to
GERD. He had an esophageal stent placed in [**4-/2116**] which was
subsequently dislodged. It resulted in obstruction and he
underwent lap converted to open for retrieval of the stent in
10/[**2116**]. Post-op, he had dehiscence and had to return to the OR
on POD6, he then had optimal healing. From the notes, the
patient was continued on his anti-seizure ppx throughout his
hospital stay. the patient is NPO and is fed through his J tube;
meds through his G tube.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  14:05 0 98.4 83 103/68 20 92%. An
EJ was placed, started on pantoprazole gtt and received NS
bolus. GI opted for EGD in am as the patient's scopes are
technically difficult secondary to extensive esophageal
strictures. Surgery was also contact[**Name (NI) **]. The patient's blood
pressures were systolic 80s for about one hour, which prompted
MICU admission. His vitals before coming to the MICU were HR 76
BP 126/78 93RA.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient reported that he was
comfortable and that he was "scared." He denied discomfort or
difficulty breathing.
.
Review of systems:  unable to obtain secondary to patient's
underlying MR.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. UGIB: the patient presented with coffee grounds from his G
tube and NG lavage.  HCT dropped from 41 on OSH admission to
stabilize at 30.  His Gtube stopped putting out coffee ground
emesis within the first 24 hours of admission.  He was started
on a PPI drip and then transitioned to oral pantoprazole twice
per [**Known lastname **]. He was also given carafate. The patient has had
multiple EGDs but the stomach and duodenum are not able to be
visualized because the scope cannot pass through the stricture.
It is possible that the bleeding was due to his recent dilation,
although unlikely due to the delayed t
