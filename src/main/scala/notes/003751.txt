CXR:
[**2191-4-12**]:The previously present right-sided chest tube
terminating in the apical area has been removed. No pneumothorax
has developed. A right-sided chest tube terminating in the
pleural space on the right lung base remain in unchanged
position. No new pulmonary or pleural abnormalities are seen.
The amount of remaining pleural effusion in the posterior
pleural sinus appears grossly unchanged when comparing the
findings on the lateral views.
[**2191-4-9**]: Improved aeration in right lung compared with earlier
the same day However, considerable persistent opacity diffusely
throughout right lung, which appears to represent a combination
of diffuse
alveolar opacity and pleural thickening and/or fluid.
2. Retrocardiac patchy opacity, worse compared with the most
recent prior
film.

[**2191-4-4**]: Improving right upper lung postoperative hematoma
Decreased asymmetric right pulmonary edema. Decreased minimal
bibasilar atelectasis.
Unchanged small left and tiny right pleural effusions
[**2191-4-3**]:  The patient is status post right upper lobe
resection. Large
homogeneous opacity extending from the right apex to the right
hilum appears similar compared to the previous post-operative
studies and could reflect a large hematoma. Heart size remains
normal. Linear bibasilar atelectasis is present, left greater
than right, with interval worsening on the left compared to the
prior study. Small left pleural effusion is apparently new.
[**2191-4-1**]: An endotracheal tube and nasogastric
tube remain in place. The changes of right upper lobectomy are
redemonstrated as is right pleural fluid, presumably hematoma.
The degree of subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe
has improved and right middle lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
[**2191-3-30**]: New right lower lobe opacity is consistent with large
right lower lobe atelectases. Patient has known right middle
lobe atelectases. There is probably a small right pleural
effusion. The cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the right
side. In the left lung, there is a small left pleural effusion
and left lower lobe atelectases.
[**2191-3-26**]:  new right paramediastinal opacity, which is
concerning for either mediastinal hematoma or newly developed
atelectasis of right middle lobe with questionable torsion.
CCT
[**2191-3-27**]: Area of contrast extravasation in the expected
location of the right middle lobe.
A severe narrowing, just distal to the origin of the artery
supplying the
right middle lobe and incomplete visualization of the right
middle lobe
bronchus are concerning for right middle lobe torsion with
active
extravasation into a small hematoma in the region.
Atelectasis in the superior segment of the right lower lobe.

Echocardiogram
[**2191-3-27**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded, but none are seen. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are grossly normal. There
is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4949**] was admitted [**2191-3-25**] following Video-assisted
thoracic surgery (VATS)  right upper lobectomy and mediastinal
lymph node dissection.  He was extubated in the operating room,
monitored in the PACU prior transfer to the floor with a left
chest tube, Foley, Dilaudid PCA for pain.

Event: [**2191-3-31**] flexible bronchoscopy in the operating room,
transfer to the ICU intubated, bedside bronchoscopy [**2191-4-1**]
successfully extubated, transfer to the floor [**2191-4-2**].

Respiratory: incentive spirometer and nebs were done. On
[**2191-3-28**] his chest film showed right middle collapse.  He was
taken to the operating room for bronchoscopy with showed large
mucus plug. He transfer to the floor in stable condition.  On
[**2191-3-31**] his CXR showed collapsed right lung he was taken to the
operating room for flexible bronchoscopy and removal of small
clot in the distal bronchus intermedius. He transfer to the ICU
intubated for positive pressure support. He underwent bedside
flexible bronchoscopy on [**2191-4-1**] and was successfully
extubated. With continued  aggressive chest PT, nebs and good
pain control he titrated off oxygen with saturation off 93-95%
RA at rest and with activity. Pt was transferred to the floor
with improving oxygen saturation.  Series of quotidien fevers
and spike to 101.8 [**4-6**] prompted CT chest concerning for
infection/necrotic RML.  Taken to OR [**4-7**] for R thoracotomy,
RMLobectomy and placement R chest tubes x 2, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] drain.
Tolerated procedure well and was xferred to the SICU for
extubation on [**4-8**].  Bronchoscopy performed [**4-9**] for concern of
mucus plugging in RLL.  CXR improved post-procedure.
Transferred to floor [**4-10**] satting well and ambulating. Pulmonary
toilet and ambulation were encouraged on the floor.  Room air
oxygen saturations 99% on discharge.

Chest-tube: right initially with a large amount of drainage,
slowly taper off and was removed on [**2191-3-30**].  Two additional R
chest tubes and [**Doctor Last Name **] drain placed in OR [**4-9**].  R antero-apical
CT d/c'd [**4-11**].  R postero-apical CT d/c'd [**4-12**].

Chest-film serial CXR showed see above reports.

Cardiac: intermittent atrial fibrillation 100-140's.  He was
started on amiodarone infusion converted to sinus rhythm within
24-48 hrs, but continued to have intermittent atrial
fibrillation with rates of 140-150's with hypotension requiring
low-dose pressors, IV amioda
