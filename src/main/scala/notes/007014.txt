Admission Date:  [**2143-6-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2143-6-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**2079-2-22**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MEDICAL ICU

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Acute on chronic hypercarbic
respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old male with
longstanding obstructive sleep apnea who presents with
hypoxemia and acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory
failure.  The patient was discharged from [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2142-12-22**] for chest
pain.  He was ruled out at that time for myocardial
infarction and PE by chest CTA.  His oxygen saturations were
noted to be 96% on room air.  Since being discharged, he has
become progressively somnolent.  He was referred to have an
overnight sleep study two days prior to admission for work-up
of his somnolence. At the sleep clinic, he was found to have
a resting oxygen saturation of 60-70% on room air, which
corrected to the high 90s with a 100% nonrebreather mask.
The sleep study was significant for apnea and persistent
desaturations.  He was referred to the Emergency Room the
next morning.

In the Emergency Room, he was found to be somnolent with
oxygen saturations in the 70s on room air and 80s on six
liters nasal cannula.  Respiratory rate of 21.  He was placed
on 100% nonrebreather and arterial blood gas revealed the
following:  7.20/109/106.  The patient was then set to be
admitted to the Medicine Floor for further work-up when he
became more somnolent and more difficult to arouse.  An
arterial blood gas on 1.5 liters nasal cannula revealed the
following:  7.17/117/65.  Oxygen saturations were 85%.  The
Medical Intensive Care Unit Team was called to evaluate the
patient.  Trial of BiPAP was unsuccessful on improving the
patient's ventilation, pCO2 improved only marginally after
being on BiPAP.  Arterial blood gas 7.21/115/82.  He was then
intubated to further improve his ventilation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No fever, chills, no cough, shortness of
breath, chest pain, weight loss, hemoptysis, melena, maroon
stools, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP 12 years ago.  Unclear of
intubations in the past.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Anxiety.
4.  Osteoarthritis - cervical.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Multivitamin.
2.  Vitamin C.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Diabetes, coronary artery disease, no
history of cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone in [**Location (un) **] and drinks three to
four beers per day.  Denies tobacco use.  He is a retired
police officer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile.  Pulse 68.  Respiratory rate
15.  Blood pressure 112/58.  Oxygen saturations 100% on
respirator.  In general, he is morbidly obese, thick neck,
intubated and sedated.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:
Sclerae are anicteric.  Cannot assess jugular venous pressure
due to neck fat.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm,
distant [**Doctor Last Name **] sounds, question split S2,P2.  Respiratory:  Few
crackles in left base, no wheezing.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft,
nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  Trace lower
extremity edema, no clubbing.

LABORATORIES:  Significant for a hematocrit of 56.2, INR of
1.9.  All other laboratories were normal.

The patient had a chest CT on [**6-19**] which demonstrated 2.4
cm left apical low density nodule that was associated post
obstructive collapse which is suspicious for lung cancer.

A CT head demonstrated no evidence of intracranial
metastases.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, left base atelectasis and
pleural effusion.

Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 80, right bundle
branch block with secondary T wave changes.  This was new
from [**2142-12-22**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Respiratory failure:  The patient only remained intubated
over the first night of admission.  At first the patient was
hyperventilated, but the pCO2 eventually corrected to
approximately 65 to 70 which was likely the patient's
baseline based on his bicarbonate.  His sedation was
lightened on the day following intubation and he was
extubated with BiPAP support.

The patient remained extubated over the rest of his admission
and was using BiPAP at night during the rest of his
admission.  His BiPAP was titrated up over the course of his
admission and his BiPAP was at 16 and 10 with O2 of two per
liters.  The patient was requiring O2 during his entire day
which was new from previous.

2.  Obstructive sleep apnea:  The patient was started on
BiPAP as mentioned above 60 and 10.  The patient will need
further outpatient sleep study following discharge as his
previous study was very poor due to his desaturations and
marked decompensation.  Repeatedly, it was discussed with the
patient that weight loss as well as decreased alcohol use
would improve his quality of life and probably require him to
use less BiPAP and possibly home O2.

3.  Lung nodule:  The patient was found to have an incidental
small 2.4 cm lung nodule and was to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient for further CT to evaluate
whether this was a growing lung nodule.

4.  Depression and anxiety:  In discussion with the patient
he appeared to be somewhat depressed during this admission
and prior to the admission, he was started on Celexa while in
the hospital.

5.  Cardiac:  The patient had a very small troponin leak
of.02.  He was ruled out for myocardial infarction by CKs and
this was likely secondary to elevated PA pressure and right
heart strain for his severe obstructive sleep apnea.  To
prevent progression of this, the patient needs outpatient
treatment for his obstructive sleep apnea.

6.  Polycythemia:  The patient's hematocrit was quite
elevated likely secondary to his hypoxia.  On discharge from
the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient's condition was
good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with home O2 therapy and BiPAP at
night.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP PLANS:
1.  Lung clinic:  [**2143-6-27**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
[**Doctor Last Name **] and CT prior to this, as well as breathing test.
2.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 96797**] [**Location (un) 1683**], primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to two
weeks.
3.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] Normal in Sleep Clinic for another sleep study
within one to two weeks.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Celexa 20 mg 1 po q.d.
2.  Oxygen 2 liters nasal continuous used during the daytime.
3.  BiPAP, EPAP 16, IPAP 10, back up rate 12, titrate O2.
Use overnight.
