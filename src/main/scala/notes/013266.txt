CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 55-year-old female with a
history of hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and
morbid obesity who presents with shortness of breath the
patient noted five days as a cough productive of yellow and
now blood-tinged sputum along with a fever to 99.4 degrees
prior to admission.  She reported no chills.  She also noted
that in the past several days prior to admission she had
increasing lower extremity edema and orthopnea.  She has been
unable to sleep and has been sitting up at night with
wheezing.  She has had no appetite lately.  No nausea,
vomiting, or diarrhea but positive abdominal pain (sharp,
left-sided, and constant) felt to be gas pain, and also
constipation (per the patient).

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
3.  Uterine and cervical hyperplasia, status post uterus
operation dilatation and curettage in [**2111-8-16**].
4.  Depression.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prilosec,
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d., Prozac 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
Megace 40 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Allergy to PENICILLIN which causes hives.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her children.  She
has visiting nurses.  Occasional alcohol use.  Quit tobacco
21 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature of 98.8,
pulse 101, blood pressure 114/palp, respiratory rate 32,
oxygen saturation 100% on nonrebreather.  Generally, an obese
black female in mild-to-moderate respiratory distress.  Head,
ears, nose, eyes and throat revealed mucous membranes were
moist.  Neck revealed no jugular venous distention was noted.
Coronary examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm,
distant heart sounds.  Lungs had diffuse rales and wheezes
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, tender to palpation on
the left greater than the right, obese, with no rebound or
guarding.  Extremities revealed 2+ edema to the knees
bilaterally.  Neurologically, alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count 8.5,
hematocrit 34, platelets 214.  Sodium 146, potassium 5.1,
chloride 107, bicarbonate 25, blood urea nitrogen 46,
creatinine 3.2, glucose of 94.  First set of creatine kinase
enzymes revealed creatine kinase of 137, MB 3, troponin of
less than 0.3.  A sputum culture was obtained with greater
than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes and greater than 10
epithelials; consistent with oropharyngeal growth.
Urinalysis was yellow, urobilinogen of 1, small bilirubin,
negative leukocytes, negative blood, negative nitrites, 30
protein, and trace ketones.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus
rhythm, rate 95, intervals within normal limits, poor R wave
progressions, and T wave inversions in leads I and III.  No
changes from [**2111-7-17**].

Chest x-ray with possible cardiomegaly, right middle lobe
pneumonia, possibly left pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   In the Emergency Room the patient received
Lasix 40 mg p.o., levofloxacin 500 mg p.o., and aspirin 325
mg p.o.  The patient was admitted for multiple medical
problems.

1.  RENAL:  For the patient's acute renal failure the patient
was seen by the Renal consultation service.  It was felt that
proteinuria noted in the patient's urinalysis could be
expected from fever, infection, hypertension, and obesity,
and the sepsis the patient appeared to be presenting.

Renal failure was felt most likely to be prerenal in origin.
Initially the Renal consultation service recommended diuresis
as opposed to intravenous fluids given her pulmonary status.
Her creatinine was followed serially.  On [**3-14**] her
creatinine was 2.2.  On [**3-15**] her creatinine was 1.  On
[**3-16**] her creatinine was 0.7 and has been stable up
until the time of discharge.  A urine protein electrophoresis
was performed as well which revealed albumin bands in the
urine.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction by serial cardiac enzymes out of concern than an
acute cardiac event could be accounting for the patient's
congestive heart failure.  An echocardiogram was performed
which revealed an ejection fraction of 40% to 45% and mild
left ventricular hypertrophy.   It was a suboptimal study
secondary to body habitus, but also revealed hypokinetic
inferior septum and wall.

Initially, the patient's hydrochlorothiazide was held given
the patient's low blood pressure, septic physiology, and
acute renal failure.  Over the weekend of [**3-19**] to
[**3-21**] the patient was given a trial of Lasix 20 mg
intravenously times two with good improvement in her
pulmonary function as described below.  After this, she was
restarted on her hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d.   In
addition, she was started on an aspirin and this was
continued throughout the admission.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  For the patient's community-acquired
pneumonia was the most likely etiology, the patient was
covered with levofloxacin and completed a 10-day course.

4.  PULMONARY:  In the beginning of the admission the patient
demonstrated an increased respiratory rate and decreased
oxygen saturation.  This was initially attributed to the
patient's pneumonia, however.  The patient was continued on
nebulizers.  A pulmonary embolus was also considered in the
differential diagnosis; however, the patient was unable to
obtain a CT angiogram to rule pulmonary embolus secondary to
body habitus.  A LENI examination of the patient's lower
extremity was negative for deep venous thrombosis.

The patient's respiratory status slowly improved; however,
she was also seen in consultation by the Pulmonary Service
for question obstructive sleep apnea.  The Pulmonary Service
felt that it was likely that she had obstructive sleep apnea
as an explanation of her ongoing shortness of breath and also
felt that she likely had reactive airway disease secondary to
the pneumonia.  It was recommended that the patient receive a
sleep study in order to determine her eligibility for CPAP.
The patient's sleep study was completed on [**3-22**] to
[**2112-3-23**].  In addition, the patient had trials of
CPAP prior to this which the patient stated were successful
and she was able to tolerate the mask.  Pending the results
of the sleep study which were pending at the time of this
dictation, the patient will be considered for CPAP.

As mentioned above, there was concern that the patient may
have had pulmonary edema contributing to her low oxygen
saturations.  A therapeutic trial of Lasix was attempted over
the course of the weekend of [**3-19**] to [**3-21**].  The
patient developed marked improvement in her pulmonary status
and was eventually weaned from face mask oxygen to nasal
cannula 3 liters.  In order to determine the patient's
ability to tolerate a beta blocker and the degree of asthma
that she had, she was considered for pulmonary function
testing; however, these were unable to be completed on an
inpatient basis secondary to logistical complications related
to the patient's body habitus.  Pulmonary function tests
should be considered as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  On [**2112-3-23**], the patient
completed her workup and was stable from a pulmonary
perspective and was deemed stable for discharge to a nursing
facility.
