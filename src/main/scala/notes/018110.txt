Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1828**]
Chief Complaint:
decreased responsiveness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77355**] is an 82 year old female with history of remote
breast CA, alcoholic cirrhosis, s/p AVR who was last seen in
normal health at 7PM on the evenig prior to admission. On the
morning of admission, the patient was found by her roommate
slumped over, fully dressed in bed. The patient is reported by
EMS records to have been supine in bed, awake, but unresponsive
to verbal or painful stimuli, additionally noted to be
incontinent of urine and feces. When EMS arrived patient's
vitals were 110/64 86 100% RA, unclear RR. The patient was
initially sent to [**Hospital 8125**] hospital where she was intubated for
airway protection. ABG prior to intubation was 7.42/27/370 on a
NRB. Per report the patient was vomiting prior to arrival and
prior to intubation. The patient had a CT head which revealed no
acute process and had a normal CXR. Given history of distant
breast CA a CTA was performed which revealed no evidence of PE
or metastatic disease but did reveal a cirrhotic appearing liver
and small ascites on abdominal cuts. The patient had a tox
screen which was normal.
.
Per discussion with the patient's family she has been generally
in her usual state of health. She has had a few recent med
changes including increase in her Xanax dosing from once daily
to three times daily approximately 2-3 weeks ago. She has no
known history of seizure disorder or large stroke although has
had history of microvascular disease. She has not had episodes
of hepatic encephalopathy previously, is not currently
maintained on lactulose.
.
ED Course: The patient was maintained on Propofol, reported to
be waking up off sedation. The patient was given Levo/Vanc,
ceftriaxone for potential infectious etiologies.

.
Admission ECG: Normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch
block and occasional premature ventricular contractions.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. No previous tracing
available for comparison.
.
Admission Chest CT:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: An endotracheal tube is seen
with the tip at 4.5 cm above the carina. An NG tube is also seen
with the tip within the stomach. Breathing artifact degrades the
quality of the study. The heart is enlarged. The pulmonary
artery is normal in size. Ascending aortic graft is seen with no
complication noted.
There are no filling defects within the main pulmonary artery to
the segmental and larger subsegmental branches to suggest
pulmonary embolism. However, evaluation of the subsegmental
branches is limited due to respiratory motion artifact.
Atherosclerotic calcifications within the aorta. Small left-
sided pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.

The patient is status post right mastectomy. There is suggestion
of chronic sternal dehiscense. There is no mediastinal, hilar,
or axillary
lymphadenopathy. Small 12mm x 8mm focal density is within the
central left
breast.
This study is not designed for the evaluation of the abdomen,
however, the
visualized portions of the upper abdomen demonstrate a cirrhotic
liver,
ascites, borderline enlarged spleen and collateral circulation.
Tiny
granuloma is seen within the spleen.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study without evidence of central and segmental PE.
2. Small left-sided pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis.
3. Cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, and ascites, incompletely
evaluated.
4. Small mass within the left breast, correlate with recent
mammogram, if
obtained. Else the pateint would need a formal diagnostic
mamogram to
evaluate this lesion further.
.
Admission MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]:
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and
diffusion
axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium. T1
axial, sagittal and coronal images were obtained following
gadolinium. There are no prior examinations for comparison.
FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate subtle area of slow
diffusion
involving both thalami. No cortical infarcts are identified.
Pre-gadolinium T1 images demonstrate hyperintensities involving
the basal ganglia, predominantly the globus pallidus and
putamen, but also involvement of the upper brainstem. Multiple
small foci of T2 hyperintensity indicative of mild- to-moderate
changes of small vessel disease also identified. Following
gadolinium, no abnormal parenchymal, vascular, or meningeal
enhancement seen.
There is a fluid level in the left maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION:
1. Subtle slow diffusion identified in both thalami could be
secondary to
global hypoxic event. Clinical correlation recommended. If
indicated, a
followup examination can help for further assessment.
2. Increased T1 pre-gadolinium signal in basal ganglia could be
secondary to hepatic insufficiency.
3. No enhancing brain lesions.
4. Mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77355**] is an 82 year old female admitted with decreased
responsiveness ultimately attributed to non-convulsive status
epilepticus.
.
#. Decreased Responsiveness: The exact cause of the pt's
unresponsiveness and seizure activity remained unclear. There
was some evidence on brain MR of changes associated with
hypoxia. It was unclear whether these may have triggered the
seizures or been a result of them; there was no obvious inciting
event to cause respiratory failure. The pt was intubated at an
outside hospital for airway protection and transferred to the
MICU at [**Hospital1 18**]. A wide differential was considered however
extensive laboratory testing was largely un revealing. The pt
was seen and followed by the neurology service who made the
diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus via serial EEG.
She was started on Dilantin. ***At the time of discharge, it was
advised that the pt should be transi
