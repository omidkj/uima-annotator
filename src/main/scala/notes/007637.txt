Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated, central line

History of Present Illness:
 Eu Critical [**Female First Name (un) 76057**] is a 79 yo F nursing home resident
identified as [**Known firstname 335**] [**Known lastname 76058**] ([**Medical Record Number 76059**]) with atrial
fibrillation on coumadin and frequent UTIs who was transferred
from an OSH for altered mental status. Per report the patient
recently was diagnosed with a UTI one week ago and started on
Ciprofloxacin on [**9-25**] for 7 day course at her rehab. her son
noticed that about 3 days prior to admission, she was noted to
be more weak. The afternoon of admission, her son also noticed
decreased PO intake, difficulty putting words together, and
increasing drowsiness. In the evening, around 7:30 PM, the
patient was found to be increasingly lethargic and unable to
protect her airway. EMS was called who emergently intubated her
in the field. She was transferred to [**Hospital6 20592**]. Her VS were 99.0 122 RR of 8 O2 sat of 78%. Her labs
there were significant for a WBC of 31.6, K of 6.9 and Cre of
5.0, INR of 2.6. ABG 7.29/26/463/17. She had EKG changes (peaked
T-waves) and received insulin, dextrose, and bicarbonate and IV
CFTX 1 gram x1. She was intubated, sedated with propofol, and
had a femoral line placed in her R groin. She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 96/70 108 18 100% 98.6% on
ventilation ([**Last Name (un) 5487**] vent settings). Patient was intubated and
sedated on arrival. She was switched from propofol to fentanyl
100 mcg x1 and midazolam 2 x1. She received 500 mg Flagyl IV x1,
Vancomycin 1 gram IV x1, and was started on Levophed 0.09 when
her pressures dropped to 60 systolic inthe ED (67/50).. She
received 3 L of NS in the ED. Head CT and CXR were obtained in
the ED. K was 3.6, Cre down to 3.6. VS on transfer were 99 92/59
112 19 94% on vent settings of PS 10/5 FiO2 of 100%.
.
On the floor, the patient is intubated, sedated, and unable to
answer questions.

Pertinent Results:
[**2169-10-5**]
Abd and pelvis:
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY: Again noted within
the limited
lung bases included on the current exam is bilateral lower lobe
opacities,
most suggestive of underlying atelectasis. The small effusions
have resolved. There is unchanged dense mass, mitral annular
calcification, aortic valve
calcification and atherosclerotic calcification.

Small amount of perihepatic ascites persists. The unenhanced
images of the
liver are unremarkable with no intrahepatic ductal dilatation
identified and surgical clips from prior cholecystectomy noted.
There is diffusely increased induration of the peripancreatic
fat with the pancreatic parenchyma appearing largely atrophic,
but with some scattered calcifications within, which may be
vascular or parenchymal in etiology. Remaining unenhanced solid
organs show no change from examination four days prior with
unchanged prominence to loops of small bowel, likely baseline
for this patient.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY: A midline ileostomy
with a small
parastomal hernia is again noted without findings of
obstruction. The degree
of fluid within the parastomal sac has decreased as has the
amount of
intrapelvic free fluid. Only a small portion of remaining
sigmoid colon
appears present, which is decompressed. Uterus does appear to
remain in situ and appears unremarkable. Bladder is collapsed
with Foley within. No
pathologically enlarged pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymph nodes
are
identified. Air is present within the right femoral vein, which
contains a
central venous catheter.

BONE WINDOWS: No short interval changes to multilevel wedge
compression
fractures as detailed on the prior examination as well as of old
left inferior and superior rami fractures and osteoarthritic
changes of the hips. Aggressive-appearing osseous lesions are
noted. There is spacing in regions of subcutaneous edema along
the left flank and left inferior abdominal wall are again noted,
likely related to the patient's known skin
inflammation/panniculitis.

IMPRESSION:

1. Increased induration surrounding the pancreas suggestive of
acute
pancreatitis, which may account for the patient's increasing
abdominal pain.
Please correlate with amylase and lipase. Unenhanced CT images
are not
specific or sensitive for biliary pathology and dedicated MRCP
can be obtained
based on clinical suspicion.

2. Interval decrease in amount of intra-abdominal/pelvic
ascites. Unchanged
appearance to the small bowel and parastomal hernia. The
majority of the
large bowel has been resected with no findings of enteritis or
colitis.

3. Interval resolution of pleural effusions with persistent
probable
bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. Superinfection cannot be
excluded by
imaging, but is felt unlikely given its appearance.

4. Central venous catheter within the right femoral vein with
air within the
vein itself likely related to injection or catheter
manipulation.


Caratoid study:
Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On the right there is minimal heterogeneous plaque in
the ICA. . On the left there is no plaque in the ICA.

On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and distal respectively are 26/9, 30/14, 31/15,
cm/sec. CCA peak systolic
velocity is 35 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 30 cm/sec.
The ICA/CCA ratio is <1. These findings are consistent with <40%
stenosis.

On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 39/17, 36/12, 33/15, cm/sec. CCA peak
systolic
velocity is 35 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 21 cm/sec.
The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.1. These findings are consistent with no
stenosis.

There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow.
There is antegrade left vertebral artery flow.

Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA with no stenosis .

[**2169-10-2**]
echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systo
