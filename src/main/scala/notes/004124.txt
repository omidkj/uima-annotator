History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 year old male with past medical history of
CAD status-post CABG in [**2103**], systolic CHF, TIA and
adenocarinoma of brain s/p resection, DVT and PE s/p IVC filter
who had witnessed tonic-clonic seizure and subsequent
unresponsiveness. Per EMS report he developed focal R sided sz
that then generalized to tonic clonic sz. He was initially
transported to [**Hospital3 **] where he was dilantin loaded and
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T100.8 P77 BP97/62 R14 O2
sat99% on BIPAP. TMax in the ED was 102.8. Head CT from [**Hospital1 **]
was re-read as post-craniotomy with possible residual tumor. UA
found to be suggestive of UTI. CXR showed L sided pleural
effusion.  He received Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and 2g
ceftriaxone.

In the ICU, patient on BIPAP. He moves both of his legs to light
touch but is not moving his upper extremities.

Past Medical History:
1. Dyslipidemia.
2. Hypertension.
3. CABG in [**2103**]
4. Pacemaker/ICD due to AV block and tachybrady syndrome
5. Cardiomyopathy with LVEF = 35% in [**10-6**].
6. PAF
7. TIA in [**2103**].
8. Macrocytic anemia, attributed to MDS with bone marrow biopsy

in [**State 531**].
9. Spinal stenosis.
10. Hypothyroidism.
11. H/o gastric ulcer; GERD.
12. OSA on nocturnal CPAP.
13. Prostate cancer s/p XRT.
14. Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary metastatic to the left
occipitoparietal region s/p resection in [**7-7**]
15. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter on Lovenox [**Hospital1 **]

EEG Study Date of [**2111-10-16**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
On
seizure detection files, there were between 30 and 40
electrographic
seizures consisting of generalized theta frequency spike and
slow wave
discharges intermixed with periods of faster monomorphic sharp
waves
with a beta frequency. The longest seizure lasted around 20
seconds
with the majority of events occurring for 10-15 seconds. Only
two of
the seizures had clinical correlates which are mentioned above.
Routine
sampling showed a background that was slow and poorly organized
with a
theta Hz frequency.

EEG Study Date of [**2111-10-20**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
It
captures many prolonged episodes of ongoing seizure activity
seen in a
generalized distribution with predominance of the posterior
quadrants
more on the left than on the right. The background activity was
slow
suggestive of a severe encephalopathy.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2111-10-19**] 2:36 PM
FINDINGS: Prior sternotomy, joint chamber pacemaker, left
pleural effusion and consolidation in the left lower lobe is
again noted. These findings are without change from [**10-16**], [**2111**]. The previously noted PICC line
appears to have been replaced by another, its tip lying at the
junction of the SVC and right atrium.
CONCLUSION: Left pleural effusion and left lower lobe
consolidation without change from [**2111-10-16**].

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2111-10-14**] 11:02 PM
IMPRESSION: Status post left parietooccipital craniotomy with
persistent
small hyperdense focus at the margin of the resection bed, which
may represent residual tumor as suggested previously. New oval
area of hyperdensity adjacent to the parietooccipital craniotomy
site, could be hemorrhage or residual tumor or post-surgical
change. MRI is recommended to characterize this finding further,
if there is no clinical contraindication for MRI.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 84 yom with PMHx of CAD, CHF, adenocarcinoma of the
brain s/p resection in [**7-7**] and DVT/PE admitted to the MICU with
new onset tonic clonic seizure and initial persistent
unresponsiveness. The patient was placed on BiPAP (DNR/DNI) and
loaded on Dilantin at OSH. Per family,
