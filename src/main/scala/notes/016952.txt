Pertinent radiology results:
CT scan abdomen [**10-23**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Marked scoliosis, with marked tortuosity of the aorta,
exaggerated by the scoliosis.
3. Bronchus intermedius appears compressed as it courses around
the marked
scoliosis between the spine and the pulmonary artery, likely
contributing to patient's likely chronic right lower lobe
atelectasis.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
5. Nodular appearing liver, perihepatic ascites, incompletely
evaluated on
this study. If clinically indicated, MRI would recommended for
further
evaluation.
6. Small pockets of free air are identified within the abdomen,
correlate with recent surgical history.
7. Emphysematous changes seen at the apices.

[**10-22**] CXR:  Increase bibasilar opacities consistent with
increasing
atelectasis and effusion, although infectious pneumonia cannot
be excluded. Pockets of gas on the right side suggest possible
loculation.

[**10-25**]: AXR:  Residual contrast is in ascending colon and small
bowel loops in the right hemi abdomen. Fewer contrast has passed
and is in the descending colon. There is mild dilatation of the
colon and some small bowel loops, this is associated with
air-fluid levels.

Severe S-shaped scoliosis is noted. Tubes and catheter
projecting in the
right upper quadrant.


Brief Hospital Course:
OPERATIONS DURING ADMISSION:
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram

PROCEDURES DURING ADMISSION:
ERCP with stent placement

CONSULTATIONS DURING ADMISSION:
Gastroenterology
Cardiology

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative
cholangiogram for recurrent choledocholithiasis and
cholelithiasis:
On [**10-21**] the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and underwent the
aforementioned procedure.  Intraoperative cholangiogram did not
reveal any leak in the cystic duct.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well, was extubated, and brought to the PACU.

Postoperatively, she complained immediately of a sharp right
sided pleuritic chest pain, worse with inspiration.  A CXR
compared to the pre-op CXR revealed new bibasilar patchy and
linear opacities.  She was started on zosyn for broadspectrum
antibiotic coverage.

2.  Persistent bile leak through the cystic duct/Possible
aspiration:
On [**10-23**] the patient triggered for increasing oxygen
requirements.  She underwent a CTA that revealed no PE, but
effusion R > L, collapsed RLL and LLL atelectasis.  An NGT was
placed to prevent aspiration.  She underwent a HIDA scan that
confirmed evidence of a bile leak from the cystic duct.

Thus later that day on [**10-23**] the patient went for an ERCP with
placement of a stent into the cystic duct. Post procedure the
patient remained intubated and was admitted to the SICU.  For
the question of aspiration she was placed on vancomycin in
addition to zosyn.  She was extubated on [**10-24**] and gradually
improved her oxygen saturations.  Her oxygen saturations most
likely decreased in the setting of a bile leak rather than frank
aspiration.

Her belly remained distended; she underwent an AXR that revealed
distended loops of bowel consistent with ileus.  Her NGT was
kept in until [**10-26**], after she had passed gas and had a bowel
movement.

On [**10-26**] her vancomycin was discontinued.  Her zosyn was kept on
until 10/08 per GI.  The patient will need a follow up ERCP in 6
weeks.

3. Atypical chest pain:  On [**10-25**] the patient had atypical
episodes of chest pain; her ECG revealed nonspecific anterior
ST-T waves changes that were new compared to prior examinations.
 Enzymes were negative.  Cardiology was consulted, who felt that

the patient ruled out for MI by enzymes, and that her symptoms
were atypical of ACS.  They recommended an echocardiogram to
assess for wall motion abnormalities/systolic dysfunction as
well as a follow up stress test.  As the patient refused the
echo prior to discharge, they recommended strongly having it
done soon as an outpatient.

The patient was also intermittently placed on ciprofloxacin for
a questionable urinary tract infection.

The remainder of the patient's hospitalization was uneventful.
She progressed
to a regular diet, though her belly still remains slightly
distended.   She is maintaining good oxygen saturations on room
air.

As mentioned previously, she should have a follow up appointment
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], a follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 6 weeks for
stent removal, and further evaluation with echocardiogram and
stress test as requested by cardiology.
