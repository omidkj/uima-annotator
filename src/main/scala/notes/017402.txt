Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1674**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension/fall weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
70 yo F with HTN, hypothyroid presents s/p fall at home. She
reported fall occured in the setting of 'weakness'. She
apparently hit her head and was transferred to ED. Per ED note
patient was febrile at home (unclear how high).
In the ED, patient had a CT head that was negative. She also had
a CXR that showed a LLL opacity, possibly PNA. Patient was given
a dose of levofloxacin and was being prepared for transfer to
floor when it was noted that her systolic pressure was in the
70's. She had a lactate drawn that came back at 2.4. Patient was
mentating. A central line was placed, she was gicev 2L of IVF
and a dose of ceftriaxone. Her SBPs increased only to the 80's,
therefore levophed was started. repeat lactate was down to 0.9.

Last set of vitals per ED resident BP 83/47, HR 70, O2 sat 96%
on 2L/RA (NC comes off). Patient mentating well, has foley in
place with good UOP.
Admitted to ICU for further management.
..
70 y.o. W with HTN, hypothyroid who initially presented to the
ED s/p fall at home in the setting of 'weakness' and fever. In
the ED patient had negative head CT, was found to have a PNA,
and was admitted to the ICU for hypotension to the 70's and
lactate of 2.4.
Now improved, on multiple antibiotics for influenza pna with
suspected bacterial superinfection.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o PNA

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old woman with fevers and cough
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o PNA
INDICATION: 70-year-old female with fevers and cough. Rule out
pneumonia.

COMPARISON: [**2187-8-14**].

PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The heart size is normal.
Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged and unremarkable.
Aortic arch calcifications are noted. Within the left lung base
in the anterior left lower lobe, there is opacity, which could
represent pneumonia. Given its somewhat linear appearance,
atelectasis is an alternative etiology. The overlying soft
tissue obscures detailed evaluation of this region.

There are no pleural effusions and there is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacity, probably representing
pneumonia. However, given linear configuration, atelectasis is
an alternative explanation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: S/P FALL

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old woman s/p fall. + hit head. no loc
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 70-year-old female status post fall. Rule out bleed.

No comparison studies.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT of the head.

FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
shift of normally midline structures. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The ventricles are prominent,
likely due to central atrophy. There is moderate diffuse white
matter hypodensity most likely representing chronic
microvascular disease. There is no evidence of acute major
vascular territorial infarction.

The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate moderate ethmoid
sinus mucosal thickening and mild bilateral right greater than
left maxillary sinus mucosal thickening. There is no evidence of
fracture. The surrounding soft tissue structures are
unremarkable. Cataract surgical changes of the globes are seen
bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormalities. Extensive
microangiopathic changes and central atrophy

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2193-1-5**] 10:16 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: ? interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old woman with asthma, pneumonia, flu
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? interval change
FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: Asthma, pneumonia, flu. Evaluate interval change.

COMPARISON: [**2192-12-29**].

FINDINGS:
There is an air-fluid level at the lower mediastinum compatible
with a hiatal hernia. There is no significant pulmonary
consolidation. There is some minimal left basilar atelectasis.
Note is made of a left shoulder hemiarthroplasty. There is
thoracic spinal degenerative discogenic disease.

IMPRESSION: Basilar atelectasis. Hiatal hernia.
=====================================================
ECG:
Sinus rhythm
Borderline first degree A-V delay
Left atrial abnormality
Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes
Since previous tracing of [**2192-1-26**], probably no significant
change
Discharge labs:




Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to ICU on [**12-25**]. In ICU patient patient requiring
4-5liters oxygen, started on levaquin for pneumonia, given
aggressive fluids for hypotension likely from
dehydration/infection.  Levaquin changed to vancomycin and
aztreonam on [**12-29**] with continued fever spikes and continued
significant oxygen requirment.
Patient started on prednisone taper, nebulizers.  Slowly
improved with stabilization of pulm status, hemodynamics, oxygen
to 3l requirement and bp's improved from 70's to 100's by
transfer to floor on [**12-31**].

On the floor from [**1-1**] on.  Completed 8day course of vancomycin
and aztreonam for possible hospital acquired pneumonia.
Maintained on prednisone, nebs, humidified O2, chest PT.

Despite aggressive Rx for above issues, patient still appeared
very dyspneic and hence CTA chest was done that revealed
bilateral PE's. In further w/u, pt was also found to have
bilateral DVT's. Started on IV heparin and coumadin to target
INR [**12-23**].

Patient is advised to have age appropriate ca screening. She has
never had a colonoscopy and mammogram was 3 years back. Given
new VTE, should have testing for hidden / occult malignancy.

ECHO showed Diastolic CHF, chronic - stable. On ASA, statin,
lisinopril, metoprolol.

Incidental finding of pulmonary nodules see on CT chest - needs
follow up. (pt informed). CT abd/pelvis as part of malignancy
w/u with non specific LAD.  Radiology recommends repeat CT torso
in approx 6 weeks ([**2193-2-19**]).Pt to d/w PCP regarding [**Name9 (PRE) **]
[**Name9 (PRE) **] CT's.

Hypothyroidism - is on levothyroxine. TSH significantly elevated
and FT4 is low. Increased dose of levothyroxine to 125
microgram/day. Recheck in [**2-24**] weeks recommended.

Hypertension - HCTZ, lisinopril, metoprolol continued after
hypotension resolved.

Hyperlipidemia - on statin

Depression - on zoloft. Mood stable.

Dispo - eventually home with PT after clinical improvement.
