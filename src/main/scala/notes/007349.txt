Chief Complaint:
Loss of consciousness

Cardiac catheterization, intubation/extubation


History of Present Illness:
60 yo M with PMH of CAD, DM, HTN with h/o prior MI.   H/o CHF
with refusal of prior Echo.  Has reportedly been out of several
medications for approximately one month.  This morning, he awoke
and his caregiver helped him to the bathroom.  He started to
walk back when he developed a severe cough and returned to the
bathroom.  He sat on the toilet, becoming acutely SOB and
diaphoretic.  Per his caregiver, he was mumbling, head tipped
back and eyes looking at ceiling.  She was concerned for seizure
(with h/o seizure) but he did respond to her the whole time.
EMS was called.  They could not get pulse oximetry, and he was
unresponsive so he was intubated in the field.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 120, 160/90 with O2 saturation in
the 30s.  Given 40mg IV Lasix x2.  CXR per ED read was
concerning for ARDS vs CHF.  Femoral line placed and given
Vanc/Zosyn for possible PNA.  EKG While in ED, sedation and BP
problem[**Name (NI) 115**].  [**Name2 (NI) **] was hypertensive upon arrival with SBPs up to
the 200s.  Started on Nitro gtt that was titrated up to maximum
of 2.98 mcg/kg/min and Fentanyl with Versed boluses for
sedation, though he was still fighting the ventilator.  Given
10mg Vecuronium at 8am due to ventilation issues.  Femoral line
placed, not sterile.  Still struggling on ventilator, started on
Propofol.  His pressure then dropped rapidly to 80/60s.  Stopped
both Nitro gtt and Propofol.  He was noted to have rising
Troponin but had no ischemic changes on ECG, thought to be a
possible NSTEMI. Because of a possible heparin allergy, the ED
was ordering Argatroban prior to transfer.  He was not given
Plavix as he had no PO access.  He did not get CTA for possible
PE because of his Creatinine of 1.7.  CT head with prior CVA, no
acute hemorrhage.  Medications at time of transfer were 5 Versed
/ 100 Fentanyl bolus with gtts, ASA 600mg PR, low dose Nitro
gtt, Argatroban to be started upon arrival in the CCU.  He
continued to have dysynchronised breathing but O2 sat was 96% on
100 FIO2 with PEEP of 10 and RR 30 x Vt 450.
.
Per discussion with caregiver and daughter upon arrival to the
floor, patient had been well and in his regular state of health
until the acute decompensation this morning.  No recent cough,
fevers, chills, difficulty breathing, chest pain, abdominal
pain, diaphoresis or unusual SOB.  Caregiver relates today's
episode is similar to one that occurred in [**2132**] when he had a
CVA and MI and was treated at [**Hospital1 112**].  No sick contacts or recent
illness.  Had stopped all medications besides Imdur, Metoprolol
and ASA in the past month due to not seeing his PCP for over [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
year.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CT Head w/o contrast [**2140-6-15**]:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territory
infarction.
2. Extensive multifocal cystic encephalomalacia, related to
chronic infarcts in the left more than right frontoparietal and
occipital lobes and right cerebellar hemisphere, with associated
ex vacuo dilatation of the left lateral and fourth ventricle,
respectively. The overall pattern is suggestive of previous
embolic infarction.
3. Chronic microvascular and lacunar infarction.
4. Fluid in the nasal cavity with air-fluid levels in the
bilateral sphenoid sinuses may be relate to intubation and
supine positioning; clinical correlation recommended.
.
CXR [**2140-6-15**]:
ET tube is approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. There is
diffuse
bilateral interstitial and airspace opacities. The heart size is
top normal. The costophrenic angles are excluded on this study.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The osseous structures are
grossly unremarkable.
CXR [**2140-6-19**]:
The patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal
of the NG tube tip. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
There is improvement in the left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity
consistent with resolution of
atelectasis. There is also improvement in the right basal
opacity most likely due to decrease in right pleural effusion.
Still bibasal opacities are present consistent with atelectasis
versus resolving pulmonary edema and should be followed closely
for documentation of complete resolution.
.
ECHO [**2140-6-15**]: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with global hypokinesis and
regional akinesis of the inferior and infero-lateral w
