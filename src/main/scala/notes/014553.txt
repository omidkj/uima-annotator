Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
ches discomfort and worsening shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CoreValve aortic valve replacement


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 68yo caucasian male who presented with c/o worsening
shortness of breath limiting activities, and chest discomfort at
rest. PMHx significant for Hodgkins disease treated with high
dose radiation to the chest in the [**2070**]'s, CAD s/p CABG and
redo,
severe aortic stenosis,PPM, DM, lupus. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] [**7-24**], underwent cardiac cath, was found to have 80%LCX
stenosis and was treated with bare metal stent. His echo
confirmed severe aortic stenosis, [**Location (un) 109**] 1.0cm2, mean gradient
45mmHG, peak velocity 4.3mm/sec.
    Mr [**Known lastname **] reports he has noted SOB over the past year,
however significantly worsening over the past few weeks. He was
walking 1.5 miles daily, now limited due to near syncopal
episodes. He was experiencing chest pain daily prior to his last
intervention. He feels his worsening shortness of breath is
severely limiting his ADLs and is seeking aortic valve treatment
options.
   Patient reports no admissions since last seen. No medication
changes. Noticing decline in functional status, now only able to
ambulate about 75 feet prior to experiencing blurred vision,
lightheadedness.

U/A: 2RBC 1WBC, no bact, no yeast, <1epi, tra protein, 150

Urine culture: no growth

CXR ([**2121-8-25**]): No acute cardiopulmonary process. No change from
prior.

Post-operative EKG ([**2121-8-26**]): Notable for new LBBB. Normal sinus
rhythm. Otherwise unchanged.

Femoral vascular ultrasound, right([**2121-8-25**]): No evidence of
arteriovenous fistula in right groin. Findings consistent with a
1.4 cm, thrombosed SFA branch pseudoaneurysm, decreased in size
compared to prior outside hospital CTA.

Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2121-8-26**]):
Pre valve deployment
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] were notified in person of the results on [**2121-8-26**] at 845
am.

Post valve deployment
Corevalve seen in the aortic position. Appears well seated.
There is 1- 2 + aortic insufficiency seen. The jet is eccentric.
The mean gradient across the aortic valve is 10 mm Hg and the
peak gradient is 17 mm Hg. The mitral regurgitation was moderate
post implant and has settled to 1+ subsequently.

Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2121-8-27**]):
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). No definite regional wall motion abnormality was
identified is suboptimal views. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis
is present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this
prosthesis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric at least mild
to moderate ([**1-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen around the pacemaker lead. The
tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated. There is no pericardial effusion.

Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2121-8-30**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present and
appears well-seated. The transaortic gradient is normal for this
prosthesis. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
paravalvular aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, laterally directed
jet of at least mild to moderate ([**1-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At
least moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity
is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-8-27**],
findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
68yo male with worsening symptomatic aortic stenosis
including blurred vision and near syncope after 100feet. Past
medical history significant for high dose mediastinal and chest
radiation, prior CABG and CABG redo, CAD-s/p NSTEMI one month
prior with PCI, pacemaker, lupus, diabetes - deemed
prohibitively
extreme risk for surgical AVR. He has met all the major
inclusion
and has none of the major exclusions for the CoreValve clinical
trial. He has been screened and accepted for TAVI/Corevalve
trial.
