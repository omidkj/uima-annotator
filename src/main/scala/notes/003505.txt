Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course

79 yo female with mild dementia, recent HAP, pleural effusions
with stage III rectal cancer now s/p perineal resection
(including sigmoidectomy, protectomy, resection of portion of
colon) with uncomplicated operative course who was admitted to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2109-10-10**] for monitoring post-operatively.  Onb
admission, the patient was noted to marked leukocytosis, which
was believed to be post-operative change.  However, given recent
history of HAP, the patient was pan-cultured.  No antibiotics
were initiated and WBC count trended down by ICU Day #2.  The
patient was given IV Morphine PRN for pain control. Nausea was
controlled with IV Zofran PRN.  The patient was noted to have
significant drop in Hct from 29.4 to 20.0 on ICU day #2.  She
was transfused with 2 units of pRBCs with appropriate response.
The patient also had significant thombocytopenia.  Because of a
concern for HIT due to long-term exposure to Heparin in this
patient, Heparin was discontinued and the patient was switched
to pneumoboots for DVT Prophylaxis.   HIT Antibody Panel was
sent and was positive.  Serotonin Release Assay was sent out.
The patient was also noted to have increasing INR to 1.8,
without a significant change in PTT.  This was believed to be
due to a poor nutritional status in this patient, although DIC
was considered as well.  DIC labs were not conclusive.  The
patient also received 2 units FFP,
