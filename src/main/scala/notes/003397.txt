Date of Birth:   [**2090-2-1**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 78-year-old female
with a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy, who presents for ethanol septal ablation.
Her hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was first discovered
approximately 2.5 years prior to admission during a
preoperative evaluation for her pancreatic surgery.  Since
then, she has noticed increasing dyspnea on exertion and
lower extremity edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with a resting
gradient of 90.
2. Type 2 diabetes, diet controlled.
3. Hypertension.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Coronary artery disease.
6. Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
1.6.
7. Moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension.
8. Status post pancreatic resection in [**2155**].
9. Status post pancreatic enucleation and resection for a
neuroendocrine tumor.
10. GERD.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Clonidine 0.1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Multivitamins.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a Russian speaking female.
She is retired and formally worked as a secretary.  She is
married and has one daughter.  She denies any history of
alcohol use or smoking.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother had [**Name (NI) 2481**] disease.  Her
father died from peritonitis.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature of 96.0, blood
pressure of 154/65, heart rate of 51, respiratory rate of 17,
and oxygen saturation 98% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
Physical exam is notable for a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur
best heard at the left sternal border.  The remainder of her
examination was normal.

LABORATORIES:  Notable for a creatinine of 1.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for ethanol septal
ablation for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy.  The second septal perforator was ablated and
her gradient decreased from 90 to 5-10 mm Hg.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  For blood pressure control,
the patient received metoprolol and captopril.  Initially,
the patient required nitroglycerin drip for blood pressure
control and eventually she was weaned off of it and started
on diltiazem extended release.  At the time of discharge, her
blood pressures were ranging from 120-140.  The patient
remained on a temporary pacemaker following septal ablation
due to the risk of complete heart block.

Following 48 hours, this temporary pacemaker was removed
since the patient had remained in sinus rhythm.  An
echocardiogram performed following the procedure showed an
improvement of her left ventricular outflow tract gradient as
well as improvement of the severity of her mitral
regurgitation.  Left ventricular function with the exception
of the basal septum remained vigorous throughout.

The patient had a brief episode of delirium following the
procedure, which was resolving by the time of discharge.  Her
creatinine also slightly elevated from 1.6 to 1.9 that
remained stable and was felt to be within her normal range.
Her diabetes was well controlled with regular insulin-sliding
scale.

She did have some mild pulmonary edema and was given Lasix
prn.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient is discharged to home.  She
requires no home services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy status post
ethanol septal ablation.
2. Diastolic heart failure.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency.
4. Hypertension.
5. Coronary artery disease.
7. Hypercholesterolemia.
8. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
9. Pulmonary hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Diltiazem sustained release 120 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Toprol XL 150 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Multivitamin one p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is scheduled to followup with
her cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2031**].  She is also due to be
scheduled for an outpatient MRI of her kidneys looking for
renal artery stenosis.
