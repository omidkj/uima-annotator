CHIEF COMPLAINT:  GI bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 36-year-old white
female with Down syndrome, VSD with Eisenmenger's syndrome,
chronic hypoxia, secondary polycythemia requiring prn
phlebotomy, pulmonary hypertension, thrombocytopenia, who
presents with bright red blood per rectum and bloody
diarrhea.  The patient has a distant history of CHF as a
child but no recent problems.  Pediatric cardiologist is Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 20760**]).  The majority of the history is
provided by patient, mother and aunt.  The patient is alert
but minimally communicative.  As per mother, the patient may
have a complaint of abdominal pain for the past few months.
She has had chronic NSAID use for back pain secondary to
spondylolisthesis and scoliosis.  The patient had been on
Indocin for several years and stopped this about a year ago.
She has recently been on Vioxx which was discontinued one
month ago secondary to concerns over elevated creatinine.
Two days ago the patient notes an onset of diarrhea followed
by dark stool and then last night noticed bright red blood
per rectum.  It continued 5-7 times over the 24 hours prior
to admission.  In the Emergency Room the patient had [**2-5**]
additional episodes of BRBPR.  In the Emergency Room the
patient was given IV fluids and 4 units of platelets.  NG
lavage was refused by patient and mother secondary to
concerns of a hypoxia and necessary sedation.  By mother's
report, the patient has had episodes of hypoxia with sedation
in the past.  The GI fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and by report
stated a planned EGD and colonoscopy in the morning but this
was also refused by patient and family over concern for
hypoxia.  The patient denies any recent fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, weight loss.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Down, trisomy 21.  2) VSD with
Eisenmenger's.  History of echocardiogram in [**2119**] by report
with no mitral regurgitation, mildly decreased bilateral
ventricular function.  3) Chronic hypoxia, baseline SPO2 in
70's.  4) Secondary polycythemia with baseline hematocrit
65-75 and prn phlebotomy at hematocrit greater than 74.  5)
Pulmonary hypertension.  6) Thrombocytopenia (35-50).  7)
Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine 1.4.  8)
Gout.  9) Chronic headache secondary to polycythemia,
relieved by phlebotomy.  10) Status post TIA.  11) Status
post umbilical hernia.  12) Hypothyroidism.  13) OSA.  14)
Scoliosis.  15) Spondylolisthesis.  16) History of multiple
GI infections.  17) History of multiple respiratory
infections.

MEDICATIONS:  Upon admission, Digoxin 0.125 mg po q day,
Lasix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **], Allopurinol 300 mg q day, Vioxx discontinued
one week to one month ago.

ALLERGIES:  Zithromax.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with endometrial cancer and
arrhythmia, father with CAD.  Four healthy brothers.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home, works in a
sheltered workshop, no tobacco or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission, temperature 95.9,
blood pressure 112/58, heart rate 110, respiratory rate 20,
pulse ox 74%.  In general this is a frightened, cyanotic
white female in mild distress with malar and nasal cyanosis.
Mucus membranes cyanotic but moist.  Heart tachycardic with a
[**3-7**] holosystolic ejection murmur at left sternal border
radiating across precordium.  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft and non distended with a
question of right upper quadrant tenderness, normal active
bowel sounds.  Extremities are with soft calves, marked
peripheral cyanosis in all digits in upper and lower
extremities bilaterally.  Skin with bluish nodules on
abdomen.  Neuro alert and responsive.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, hematocrit 75, white blood
cell count 7.9, platelet count 34,000, sodium 143, potassium
4.5, chloride 99, CO2 31, BUN 67, creatinine 1.7.  Urinalysis
with greater than 300 protein and rare bacteria.  AST 59, ALT
16, alkaline phosphatase 87, total bilirubin 0.9, uric acid
6.5, lactate 2.7, TSH 3.1.

Chest x-ray in the Emergency Room demonstrated cardiomegaly
but no pneumonia or intrapulmonary pathologic processes
noted.

Bleeding scan negative for any active bleeding.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  GI:  The patient had no further episodes of GI bleeding
after being admitted to the medical ICU.  The patient and
family refused colonoscopy and NG lavage for fear of
desaturation with sedation.  They preferred instead to go to
[**Hospital3 1810**] in the future if the patient has any
further bleeding.  Stool studies were sent and were negative
for C.diff and E. coli but three PMNs were noticed on fecal
leukocyte exam.  The differential diagnosis for her bright
red blood per rectum included an infectious colitis or an
ischemic colitis from her hyperviscosity.  However, given the
PMNs on fecal studies and the resolution of the bright red
blood per rectum, it is felt that it was likely infectious in
quality.  On [**10-26**] the patient was noted to have a
normal bowel movement that was guaiac negative and the
patient was discharged to home with follow-up with her
primary care physicians.  The patient will be treated with a
total 14 day course to eradicate H. pylori.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient maintained her baseline
saturations in the 70's during this admission with no further
issues.

3.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was noted on admission to be
tachycardic and orthostatic which improved with IV fluids.
She will follow-up with her outpatient cardiologist from the
[**Hospital1 756**] after discharge.

4.  Heme:  The patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 75
upon admission which dropped as low as in the 60's during her
hospitalization after her episode of GI bleeding.  The
patient did not require transfusion and maintained her
baseline oxygen saturations throughout this admission.  An
arbitrary decision was made to transfuse the patient if her
hematocrit dropped below 60 as she typically runs in the mid
60's and a lower hematocrit would be more of a stress for her
heart but this never occurred.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**10-25**] and was
stable for the next 24 hours with a guaiac negative stool.
It was decided to defer on colonoscopy and EGD and the
patient will follow-up with her primary care physician if
further rebleeding occurs.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Tetracycline 500 mg qid times 14
days, Flagyl 500 mg tid times 14 days, Bismuth subsalicylate
two tabs po qid times 14 days, Protonix 40 mg q day times 14
days, Digoxin 0.125 mg po q day, Allopurinol 300 mg po q day,
Levothyroxine 112 mcg po q day.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.
