Service:  COLORECTAL SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old
woman with a complex medical history remarkable for multiple
past surgeries and hospitalizations for enterocutaneous
fistulae.  She first developed fistulae approximately seven
years ago following an exploratory laparotomy for small bowel
obstruction and incisional hernia repair.  She has had
numerous hospitalizations since then with recurrence of her
fistulae.  In [**2108-11-23**], she noted a breakdown of the
skin around her most recent fistulae and was admitted to
[**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital for exploratory laparotomy, lysis
of adhesions, and resection of her enterocutaneous fistulae
along with small bowel resection.

On that admission, she developed a fluid collection that was
percutaneously drained and remarkable for E. coli, MRSA, and
VRE.  In early [**Month (only) 1096**], she was readmitted to [**Hospital3 1442**] for new onset of bilious drainage from the lower
part of her surgical incision and subcutaneously transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2109-2-5**] for further management of her
fistulae.  She was evaluated at this time and not felt to be
a good surgical candidate.  At this time, it was decided to
improve the patient's nutritional status with TPN and then
bring her back for surgical intervention when she was
physically stronger.

After discharge from [**Hospital1 18**], on [**2109-2-18**], she
subsequently returned to [**Hospital3 1443**] on [**2109-2-26**] with
fevers.  Her hospital course there was significant for
intermittent drainage from her wound which grew out E. coli.
Her antibiotics were changed at that time to Levaquin and
doxycycline secondary to pancytopenia.  She was transfused 2
units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 22
without any evidence of GI bleed.  She has taken no oral
intake except for ice chips for several months now.

On [**2109-4-2**], she was transferred from [**Hospital3 1443**] to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management of her enterocutaneous fistulae.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.9, pulse 85, blood pressure 134/58, respirations 20, 02
saturation 98% on room air.  General:  The patient was alert,
comfortable.  HEENT:  The head was normocephalic, atraumatic.
Neck:  Supple.  The patient was anicteric.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm
with a III/VI holosystolic murmur.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft,
nondistended, tender lower abdomen with erythema surrounding
the incision.  Also noted is a dry old drainage site in the
lower abdomen with ulceration.  Extremities:  Without
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Colorectal
Surgery Service where she was continued on Levaquin and
doxycycline and was prepared for surgery.  On [**2109-4-4**],
she was taken to the Operating Room, right colorrhaphy, small
bowel resection, ventral hernia repair with mesh, excision of
mesh from previous hernia, and placement of a gastrostomy tube
lysis of
adhesions were performed.  She tolerated the procedure in
guarded condition and was taken to the Intensive Care Unit
for close monitoring.

Intraoperatively, she received 7 units of FFP, 6 units of
packed red blood cells, and 1 unit of platelets.  In the
Intensive Care Unit, she was kept intubated overnight.  She
received TPN for nutritional support.  She was treated with
perioperative beta blockade and received antibiotic coverage
with Levaquin, doxycycline, vancomycin, and Flagyl.  She
received several fluid boluses immediately postoperatively
for oliguria.  She was extubated on postoperative day number
one.

On postoperative day number two, she was transfused 2 units
of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 25.  Her
antibiotics were changed to Levaquin, Flagyl, and linazolid
for concern of VRE.  Her pain was controlled with a Dilaudid
PCA.

On [**2109-4-9**], she remained afebrile and her antibiotics
were discontinued.  On [**2109-4-12**], the patient remained
stable, however, she experienced no return of bowel function.
A CT scan was performed at that time which was suggestive of
a small bowel obstruction.  Also noted was a significant
amount of ascites.

On postoperative day number 11, [**2109-4-15**], the JP was
discontinued.  Her condition was stable and she was
transferred to the floor.  However, her white blood cell
count was noted to be elevated.  Cultures from her urine
revealed yeast and she was started on fluconazole.  Her CVL
was changed also at this time.  On [**2109-4-18**], the patient
developed shaking chills and tachycardia.  She was found to
have dark green drainage from the base of her wound.  Upon
further exploration of the wound, a fascial defect was found.

She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and started on
broad spectrum antibiotics on [**2109-4-19**].  A CAT scan of her
abdomen revealed a large left upper quadrant fluid
collection.  Interventional percutaneous drainage of this
collection was performed which produced 300 cc of bloody
fluid.  Cultures from this fluid grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**], Enterococcus,
Pseudomonas, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
She was covered with Zosyn, vancomycin, Flagyl, and
fluconazole for these organisms.  C. difficile toxin was
checked and found to be positive which was covered by the
Flagyl therapy.

Her condition stabilized in the Intensive Care Unit.  She
remained afebrile and her vital signs remained stable.
However, she continued to have worsening liver dysfunction
and thrombocytopenia.  Her abdominal wound incisions were
opened with a large superior wound with fistulae drainage
from the superior most portion of the wound.  A smaller
inferior wound opened as well.  The wounds were aggressively
treated with dressing changes and an ostomy appliance was
constructed over the fistulae drainage to keep the open
wounds clean.

She was transferred back to the floor on [**2109-4-24**].  Due to
her continued increased bilirubin levels, a Hepatology
consult was requested.  NUmerous discussions with the hepatology
team and the liver transplant service were held "off-line" with
the effort to further brainstorm possible treatments as well as
etiology.  It was felt that this was likely due
to cirrhosis with portal hypertension of unclear origin.
Hepatitis screen was negative.  Ultrasound performed on
[**2109-4-27**] revealed flow through the hepatic veins, artery, and
portal vein.  She was started on Actigall out of
consideration of possibility of cholestasis as cause of her
liver dysfunction.  She was also started on Aldactone for
management of her ascites.

She was taken for an MRI on [**2109-4-30**] which she was unable to
tolerate due to claustrophobia and the procedure had to be
aborted.  On [**2109-5-2**], her fluconazole and Zosyn were
discontinued out of the possibility of antibiotic medication
causing her liver dysfunction.  However, her bilirubin
continued to increase and by [**2109-5-3**] it was up to 16.
Ultrasound was repeated at this time which revealed a nodular
liver consistent with cirrhosis, ascites, reversed flo
