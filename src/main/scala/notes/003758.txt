Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2109-2-2**]: Left Burr Hole evacuation of SDH


History of Present Illness:
72 yo left handed male w/ PMHx [**Month/Day/Year 65**] for CAD s/p MI, CABG, CHF w/
EF 15% who presents as transfer from OSH for SDH.  The history
is obtained through wife as patient appears fatigued and in
slight resp distress.  His wife found him outside a couple of
months ago crawling to the house.  He said that he had fallen.
She then noticed 1-2 days ago that he had trouble walking.  He
stayed in bed almost all of yesterday.  Today she notice that
his R arm and leg were not working very well.  He also saying
things that did not make sense at times like he was "going back
to [**State 108**]" when there were no plans to do so.  He could only
walk [**1-25**] steps with a walker yesterday.  He was brought to an
OSH today where head CT showed a large 3 cm L SDH with 1 cm
midline shift.
.
The patient was given Vitamin K, FFP, and platelets prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  Upon arrival he was note to have erythema of
his skin concerning for rash and he was given benadryl and
Solu-Medrol out of concern for a transfusion reaction.

IMAGING:
---------------
CT head w/o contrast [**2109-2-2**]:
There is a large 3.3 x 7.8 x 11.7 cm lentiform predominantly
low-density extra-axial fluid collection overlying the left
cerebral hemisphere, which has high density rim and internal
septations, compatible with chronic subdural hematoma. This
causes substantial mass effect on the adjacent sulci, as well as
effacement of the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], and 13-mm rightward shift
of normally midline structures, resulting in rightward
subfalcine herniation. There is mild left uncal herniation and
relative widening of the cerebellomedullary cistern on the left
compared to the right. These findings are not changed from one
day prior. Also not changed is area of low density with loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation along the posterior right
temporoparietal lobe, consistent with evolving subacute infarct.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, hydrocephalus, or acute large vascular territory
infarction is seen compared to one day prior. Note is made of
stranding within the right occipital scalp (2:18). The patient
has left lens replacement. No skull fracture is seen. 6-mm round
well-circumscribed focus in the left frontal bone (3:36) is well
circumscribed and has nonaggressive features. Mild mucosal
thickening is noted at the left frontoethmoid junction. Vascular
calcifications are noted along the cavernous carotid arteries.
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Large lentiform predominantly hypodense extra-axial
collection along the left cerebral hemisphere, with hyperdense
rim and internal septations,
compatible with chronic subdural hematoma. This collection
causes substantial mass effect, including rightward subfalcine
herniation and early left uncal herniation. Findings not changed
from one day prior.
2. Hypodense evolving subacute-to-chronic posterior right
temporoparietal
lobe infarct, unchanged.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**2109-2-3**]: Substantial reduction in size of
the subdural hemorrhage, but with presence of what is likely an
acute component along its superficial aspect, as noted above.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**2109-2-4**]: Little change in comparison to one
day prior, with persistent presence of likely acute subdural
hematoma along the superficial aspect of the subdural
collection.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**2109-2-7**]: No significant interval change
with persistent left subdural extra-axial collection with some
residual acute hemorrhage, with grossly stable mass effect on
the left hemisphere, and stable shift of midline structure.
.
CXR [**2109-2-6**]:
The moderate cardiomegaly with associated pulmonary edema is
unchanged. Right lower lobe collapse persists. There are mild
small bilateral pleural effusions. Pacer/defibrillator wires
terminate appropriately, unchanged. Sternal wires are intact.
IMPRESSION:
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema.
Persistent right lower lobe collapse.
.
Echocardiogram [**2109-2-3**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There
is a very small pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit Course: He was initially
admitted to the neurosurgical ICU with confusion. Head imaging
showed a subacute subdural hematoma. He underwent evacuation of
the subdural hematoma with burrhole. The procedure was
uncomplicated. The evening following the extubation he was found
to be in worsened respiratory distress. He had pre-existing
central sleep apnea for which he used bipap however he had
worsened from his baseline. He had gone into afib with RVR in
the setting of his rate controlling metoprolol for his PAF being
held. His h
