Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
31M with hx of familial dyslipidemia, HTN, acute pancreatitis
(98, 03) and nephrolithiasis who presents from OSH after being
dx with acute pancreatitis.  [**11-6**] the pt began to have severe
epigastric pain which radiated over his entire abdomen and
traveled to his back, left shoulder.  The pain reminded him of
his prior episodes of acute pancreatitis.  He also had diarrhea,
N/V, and one episode of chills, no fevers.  He was unable to eat
or drink anything the entire day.

His initial labs at the OSH included: WBC 15.7, Triglyceride
2881, Amylase 747, Lipase 486, and normal LFT's.  Also of note,
the pt's CK rose from 347 -> 1812) with low MB and troponin.  CT
without pancreatic necrosis. The pt was made NPO, given IVF, and
demerol/morphine for pain.  He was given levo/flagyl x1dose and
then transitioned to imipenem.

Upon presentation to the [**Hospital1 **] ICU, he had [**7-28**] pain with guarding
and N but no V.  The pt denied any CP, SOB, fever, numbnes,
tingling, weakness, dizzines, dysuria, or cough.  He admits not
taking his dyslipidemia medication for the past month (crestor,
tricor).

Brief Hospital Course:
31M with hx of familial dyslipidemia, HTN, acute pancreatitis
('[**60**], '[**65**]) and nephrolithiasis who presents from OSH after being
dx w/acute pancreatitis. On admission TG > 1200 and patient
admits to poor compliance with lipid lowering med. Was observed
in ICU then transferred to floor. Continued to be tachy & ECG
w/S1Q3T3 & CTA revealed PE so started on heparin gtt & coumadin.
Also likely PNA so tx w/Abx.

# Pulmonary Embolus: Pt was hypoxic and tachycardic upon
transfer from the ICU.  His ECG demonstrated sinus tachycardia
with S1Q3T3. A CTA of his lung revealed right lower lobe
pulmonary arterial branch and posterior basal segmental branch
emboli along with a wedge-shaped area of consolidation in the
posterior right lower lobe, concerning for pulmonary infarct. He
was started on a heparin gtt and coumadin.  We obtained an echo
which demonstrated normal right ventricle function and size.
Once he attained a therapeutic INR of 2.1 his heparin drip was
discontinued and he was continued on his coumadin.

The medical team spoke to pt's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2643**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 59461**]) and informed him of the [**Hospital **] medical issues and pulmonary
embolus. PCP will follow his INR upon discharge. The patient
also developed a pulmonary emblolus while on SC heparin
prophylaxis. No recent plane travel, surgery, or LE injury. Pt
did have a R femoral line upon transfer from the outside
hospital. We would like him to have a hypercoagulability work up
as an outpt & pt agrees to call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6160**] of heme/onc.

# Fevers, leukocytosis and LLL consolidation on CXR: Pt
continued to have low grade fevers which we at first attributed
to his pulmonary embolus.  He then developed a WBC which peaked
at 19K raising our suspicion for potential infection.  Repeat
CXR along with relook at CTA of lung demonstrated LLL
collapse/atelectasis/consolidation which was concerning for
pneumonia. We thus started him on levofloxacin but then switched
it to cefpodoxime (out of concern about the effect of
levofloxacin and the patient's INR) with plan to complete a
[**10-1**] day course for his pneumonia. We also searched for other
potential sites of infection--his blood cultures are without
growth to date, his UA was negative. He was having [**2-19**] BMs of
formed stool a day without cramping thus we were concerned about
C Diff and his stool was negative for C.diff toxin x 2.

# Acute pancreatitis/Dyslipidemia: Pt transferred from OSH
w/acute pancreatitis and hypertriglyceridemia. This was likely
secondary to the patients severe dyslipdemia in setting of
medicine non-compliance. No excessive EtOH use. Pt was educated
several times about the importance of being compliant with his
meds to prevent futher attacks of acute pancreatitis. He
received agressive fluid repletion in the ICU- > 7 L and was
then transferred to the floor. Serum calcium was low at 6.4 upon
transfer but normalized as his pancreatitis resolved.  His diet
was slowly advance and is currently tolerating a house diet.

# Hypertriglyceridemia: he is currently on tricor with good
effect. His triglycerides have decreased from 1445 to 238 with
this medication.

# Elevated CK: Etiology of this unclear, but it continued to
decrease.  We did not think that it was cardiac in origin given
cardiac enzymes. We also thought that it was unlikely to be due
to his crestor since he has not taken  it in a month.  He denied
muscle aches.

# HTN: The patient is reported to have a history of hypertension
but while in the hospital his blood pressures remaind well
controlled without anti-hypertensive medications.

# Prophylaxis: on PPI for heparin gtt.
