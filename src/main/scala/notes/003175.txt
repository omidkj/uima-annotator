ERCP


History of Present Illness:
73M cad, s/p CABG [**01**] yrs ago, HTN, hyperlipd, afib on amiodarone
presented to ED on [**4-13**] with sudden onset generalized abd
pain/nausea/vomiting. S/P CCY 4yrs ago (was necrotic per
report). Denied fevers, chills, dysuria, lighheadedness, chest
pain, SOB. In ED, CT abd showed extensive intra- and
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation with a 2.6 cm oblong
stone likely impacted in the ampulla. There was associated edema
in the pancreas head with surrounding inflammatory change
consistent with biliary stone pancreatitis. ERCP was preformed
on [**2198-4-13**], found impacted stone in the major papilla--was
started on levo and amp.  However, the endoscopists were unable
to remove the stone. Instead, they peformed a sphincterotomy and
placed a pigtail biliary stent.   Upon admission to the floor,
the patient's LFTs had trended down and his elevated
amylase/lipase have resolved. The patient was maintained on
zosyn and remained afebrile.
.
His floor course was complicated by afib + RVR and newly
discovered pericardial rub. The patient was able to maintain his
pressures. Bedside echo was done to rule out cardiac tamponade
and was negative for pericardial effusion. The patient had
continued to have abdominal pain with a significant
leucocytosis, so the surgical team was consulted to evaluate his
abdomen with the concern that there was may have been a
perforation during the procedure.  Repeat abdominal CT, however,
did not demonstrate an acute surgical issue.

CT Torso:
CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The aortic root is mildly
dilated measuring 4.2 x 4.1 cm in transverse and AP dimensions
respectively. There is no evidence of aortic dissection. The
heart size is enlarged. There are extensive coronary artery
calcifications. There is moderate mediastinal lipomatosis. The
patient is status post CABG and median sternotomy. No filling
defects are identified within the pulmonary vasculature to
suggest pulmonary embolus. The lungs demonstrate dependent
atelectatic changes. There is no parenchymal consolidation to
suggest underlying pneumonia. There is a moderate hiatal hernia.
Airways are patent to the subsegmental bronchi bilaterally.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion. No pathologically
enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are identified. A
filling defect in the right common carotid artery may reflect
mixing artifact, although underlying thrombosis is not entirely
excluded. The thyroid is enlarged and contains numerous
low-density nodules.
.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is severe intrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation with the right common hepatic duct
measuring up to 2 cm. The patient is status post
cholecystectomy. The liver parenchyma is uniformly dense,
possibly secondary to amiodarone therapy. Subcentimeter rounded
hypodensities are seen throughout the liver, too small to
characterize, likely cysts. The common bile duct is dilated to
1.6 cm. There is thickening of the distal common bile duct
adjacent to an oblong 2.6-cm hyperdensity consistent with a
stone that appears to protrude into the lumen of the duodenum.
There is extensive inflammatory change in the adjacent
mesenteric fat with edema and architectural distortion in the
head of the pancreas consistent with acute pancreatitis. There
are multiple periportal, aortocaval and peripancreatic enlarged
lymph nodes measuring up to 1.4 cm in short axis.
.
The stomach and unopacified loops of large and small bowel are
grossly unremarkable. There is no free intraperitoneal air. The
spleen and adrenal glands appear normal. The kidneys demonstrate
cortical thinning but enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast
normally. Several subcentimeter rounded hypodensities within
both kidneys are too small to characterize, likely cysts. There
are extensive calcifications throughout the abdominal aorta and
its branches. A normal air- filled appendix is seen in the right
lower quadrant.
.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The ureters, urinary bladder, rectum
and sigmoid colon are normal. The prostate is mildly enlarged
measuring 5.6 x 4.1 cm. Small bilateral fat-containing inguinal
hernias. There is no free pelvic fluid and no inguinal or pelvic
lymphadenopathy.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolus. Mild
dilatation of the ascending aortic root measuring 4.2 x 4.1 cm.
2. Extensive intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation
with a 2.6 cm oblong stone likely impacted in the ampulla. There
is associated edema in the pancreas head with surrounding
inflammatory change consistent with biliary stone pancreatitis.
Further characterization with ERCP is recommended.
3. Multiple low-attenuation nodules in an enlarged thyroid
gland. Correlate clinically and with thyroid ultrasound if
warranted.
4. Subcentimeter rounded hypodensities throughout the liver
which are too small to characterize, likely cysts. Diffuse
attenuation of the liver parenchyma may reflect response to
amiodarone treatment.
5. Atrophic kidneys containing tiny cysts which are too small to
fully characterize. No hydronephrosis or calculi are identified.

6. Moderate degenerative change in the lumbar spine with grade 2
anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.
7. Low attenuation within the right internal jugular vein likely
secondary to mixing, although underlying thrombus is not
excluded. Correlate clinically and with vascular ultrasound if
warranted.
.
Echo:
EF 20%
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis and inferior and apical akinesis. No focal aneurysm
or masses/thrombi are seen. Right ventricular cham
