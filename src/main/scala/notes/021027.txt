Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]
Chief Complaint:
tachycardia, delerium, lightheadedness, dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH significant for COPD, PVD, and dementia
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**3-24**] with tachycardia. Of note, a
majority of this note is taken from my gerontology consult note
from [**2178-3-27**]. Patient was sent to the ED from her [**Hospital1 1501**] for
lightheadedness, dizziness, and a HR in the 140s. In the ED, VS
were 98.5 154/49 124 28 96% 2L NC. Her Hct was decreased at 20.6
but stools were guiac negative. The patient was given
ceftriaxone and vanco given concern for infection. She also
received a total of 15 mg of IV diltiazem with minimal effect on
her HR. She was trasfused 2 units of PRBC and received 2376 cc
of NS. She was then started on a diltiazem drip and admitted to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission note, the patient is noted to be
"pleasantly demented" but more complete mental status testing is
not available. Nursing note notes her to be A&O x1. However, the
sitter log notes that she was very restless and "picking" so it
is likely she was delirious at the time of admission. Nursing
notes that she was aggitated and trying to get out of bed so was
given 1 mg of IV haldol. During her first day in the unit, the
patient alternated between sinus and atrial fib with RVR. ECG
did show evidence of demand in the setting of tachycardia. The
patient was transfused another unit of PRBC. She was treated for
a COPD exacerbation with nebs, IV steroids, and azithromycin. As
it was felt that upper airway issues were also playing a large
role in her wheezing and the steroids were contributing to her
delirium, they have been quickly tapered. She was also started
on treatment for an enterococcal UTI with vanco. There was
concern for a possible PE and the patient had negative LE US and
CTA yesterday. CTA was significant for a spiculated mass is
noted within the right upper lobe which measures 11 x 13 mm.
Another nodule is seen within the left apex that measures 7 mm.
However the assessment of these lesions are some what limited
due to patient movement.
.
On transfer, the patient denied any pain. Unable to focus on
questions. Very inattentive but talking at length about her
family, wanting to leave, and needing to find her grandson an
apartment.


Past Medical History:
1) COPD
2) Previous tobacco abuse
3) OA (on Celebrex)

years)

Social History:
Patient is widowed. She moved to Boson from [**Location (un) **] in [**1-/2178**]

here at [**Hospital1 18**]. She has been living at the [**Hospital1 **]
Alzheimer's Unit since moving to [**Location (un) 86**] but there were plans for
her to move to the [**Hospital2 34116**] [**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 13040**] on
[**2178-3-28**]. The patient has smoked [**11-18**] PPD for 75 years but
appears to have been on a nicotine patch since moving to [**Location (un) 86**].
No ETOH. Ambulates with a front wheeled rolling walker.

TTE: Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe
mitral annular calcification with associated mitral inflow
gradient. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. Mild to moderate ([**11-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
CTA chest: IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Increased interstitial markings bilaterally. This appearance
suggest heart failure. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are
also present, which are associated with compressive atelectasis.
3. Spiculated mass is noted within the right upper lobe which
measures 11 x 13 mm. Another nodule is seen within the left apex
that measures 7 mm.
However the assessment of these lesions are some what limited
due to patient movement. Follow up of these masses in 3 month is
recommended.
4. One nodule is seen within the left lobe of the thyroid that
measures 9 x 10 mm. Ultrasound is recommended for further
characterization if clinically indicated.
.
Ultrasound LE bilaterally: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT
involving the right or left lower extremities.
.
CXR [**3-30**]: FINDINGS: Compared with [**2178-3-28**], no overt CHF or
edema. The patchy retrocardiac opacity has partially cleared.
Lungs are otherwise clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient initially admitted to the MICU with afib with RVR to the
150s requiring a dilt drip.  Received 2U PRBCs (believed
trending down of AOCD; no evidence of acute bleed) that she
responded to.  Also treated for COPD flare.  EKG showed demand
ischemia when in RVR that resolved with less strain.  Also
appeared to have flashed (likely diastolic dysfunction) and
required diuresis.  Initially question of pneumonia as well so
given vanc/ceftriaxone; changed to azithro alone and treated 5
days as COPD flare.  In ICU respiratory status remained tenuous
so CTA done and heparin started empirically; no PE seen so
heparin stopped.  Enterococcal UTI identified so started on
ampicillin as well (sensitive).  Geriatrics consulted for
patient's delirium as well.
.
1) Afib with RVR: Improved with improved volume status.  No
evidence of acute ischemia.  Returned to sinus rhythm.
Maintained on diltiazem.  Will change to long acting diltiazem
on discharge.  Discussed with grandson who does not want to have
patient anticoagulated at this time.  Can readdress in
outpatient setting.
.
2) Delirium: Believed to multifactorial incl. infections, ICU
stay, anemia, COPD exacerbation, diastolic CHF, high dose
steroids.  Appreciate [**Female First Name (un) **] consult input.  Mental sta
