Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
80yo female with multiple medical problems including
hypertension, recent ICU admission with pulmonary edema and
ARDS, and previous admission for septic hip treatment was
admitted with shortness of breath and chest pain.
.
She has had several recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] within the last 3
months.
- [**Date range (1) 44958**] - She was admitted with a right septic hip and
underwent a washout and repair. She was discharged to complete a
6 week course of nafcillin
- [**Date range (1) 44959**]/09 - She was hospitalized with shortness of breath.
During that admission, she was found to have bilateral
infiltrates consistent with multifocal pneumonia and
superimposed pulmonary edema, as well as diffuse alveolar
hemorrhage. For the pneumonia, she was treated with broad
spectrum antibiotics of vancomcyin, zosyn, and azithromycin. For
the pulmonary edema, she was treated aggressively with
diuretics, nitroglycerin, and beta blockers. For the diffuse
alveolar hemorrhage, she was treated for a short time with
steroids complicated by delirium and underwent an extensive
autoimmune work-up which was negative. She was discharged to
rehab with 2L O2 and furosemide 40mg PO bid.
.
While at Rehab, she has developed multiple complications,
including delirium, acute renal failure, fever, chest pain, and
shortness of breath. Her delirium was thought likely related to
medications (received a short course of baclofen), infection,
and renal failure. Regarding her acute renal failure, her
creatinine increased to 2.6 from 1.5 within 2 days after
discharge, her furosemide and anti-hypertensives were
discontinued, and she was started on IVF. Regarding her fever,
she was febrile as high as 102 at the rehab. Regarding her chest
pain and shortness of breath, she was evaluated by a pulmonary
consultant on the day of her transfer and she was thought to be
in a CHF exacerbation.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, temp 100.2, HR 86, BP 133/50, RR 18,
Pulse ox 77% on room air. While in the ED, she remained
afebrile, normotensive, and 96-10% on NRB. She received SL NG x
3 and was then started on a nitro drip for chest pain. She had
blood cultures drawn and received zosyn. She also received zosyn
for pneumonia, was started on a heparin drip for treatment of a
presumed pneumonia, and also given fentanyl 25mcg IV x 1 for
treatment of chest pain.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, she initially reported [**7-24**] chest
pain, which she describes as located across her left anterior
chest, character is pleuritic, duration is intermittent,
worsened with deep inspiration or movement, and reliever with
hydromorphone and rest. Additional review of systems is notable
for the following: shortness of breath, fatigue, back pain
(chronic and unchanged), lower extremity swelling, and neck pain
(chronic and unchanged). Her delirium has markedly improved
according to her daughters.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools, red
stools. He denies shaking chills, rigors. dysuria, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, cough, sputum production. She denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.

[**2122-3-29**] CXR: There is fluctuating appearance of the parenchymal
opacities consistent with recurrent pulmonary edema. Compared to
the most recent chest radiograph from [**2122-3-28**], there is
interval progression of parenchymal opacities involving the
entire lungs that is worrisome for interval worsening of
pulmonary edema
