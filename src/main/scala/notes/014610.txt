Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, hypoxia, tachypnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation [**2114-10-31**]
Central venous catheter placement [**2114-11-1**]


History of Present Illness:
79 yo M w/ CHF, PVD, s/p AKA, s/p ureteral stents and s/p
partial penisectomy (distal shaft of penis excised) with
indwelling catheter transferred from [**Hospital 1263**] hospital with
fevers, bilateral rhonchi, and hypoxia.
.
Patient intubated so history is limited. Daughter [**Name (NI) 653**] but
has not seen patient in weeks and was unable to provide history.
Per [**Hospital 1263**] hospital records patient had temp 101.8, hr 124, bp
142/80, and 78% on NRB. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
further management.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS HR 125, BP 145/68, RR 30, 99% NRB. Patient was
found to be minimally responsive, only moaning. He was very
tachypneic to 30s and rhonchorous on exam. He was intubated and
noted to not have a gag reflex. Urology was consulted concern
for penile/scrotal infection at area of excision. Urology did
not feel that there was superficial wound infection and
recommended keeping foley to gravity. In the ED his HR ranged
120s-140s, SBP 100s-130s. An ECG was notable for sinus tachy,
123 bpm, w/ twi v3-v6. On labs he had leukocytosis of 14.5 w/
left shift, no bands, lactate 3.2, Na 171, Cl 131, Cr 3.7. UA w/
blood, prot, wbc, bact, and leuks. ABG on FIO2 100 was 7.45, 34,
212. CXR read to have low lung volumes, no infiltrates. He was
written for vanc/cefepime, but due to nursing error received
vanc/gent becaus error. He also received 2L NS and started on
propafol gtt. Has REJ and piv. His vitals on transfer are:
94/57, 120s, 99% on vent.

CT ABD/PELVIS [**2114-11-1**]
1. Multifocal pneumonia with right greater than left parenchymal

consolidation.
2. Bilateral double-J nephroureteral stents in standard
positions. Right
renal calculi measuring 1.0 cm in the right interpolar region.
3. Heterogeneous nodular thyroid.
4. Extensive heterotopic calcification and degenerative changes
in the
shoulders and hips.

TTE [**2114-11-2**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal global biventricular systolic function. Mild
mitral and aortic regurgitation. Limited study.




Brief Hospital Course:
#Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure - Due to multifocal
healthcare-associated pneumonia and altered mental status in the
setting of hypernatremia. Supported with mechanical ventilation
from [**10-31**] to [**11-6**], antibiotics, and IV fluids. Sputum Cx [**11-1**]
grew MRSA and H. influenzae. Antibiotics discontinued [**11-7**] when
the patient was made CMO.
.
#Acute complicated urinary tract infection - Urine culture
[**2114-11-3**] grew >100K Enterococcus. Treated with vancomycin until
made comfort measures only.
.
#Acute kidney injury - Resolved with fluid resuscitation. Did
not require renal replacement therapy.
.
#Hypernatremia - Presumably due to poor free water intake.
Resolved with gradual correction of free water deficit.
.
#Nutrition - Given tube feeds while intubated. After extubation,
NG tube placed but the patient removed it. Not replaced given
overall goals of care. [**Month (only) 116**] eat and drink as desired for comfort.

.
#Goals of care - Given the patient's poor functional status and
quality of life, the decision was made to pursue comfort
measures only (and do not rehospitalize order) after a
discussion between the medical team and the patient's
daughter/healthcare proxy. Hospice services arranged for after
discharge.
