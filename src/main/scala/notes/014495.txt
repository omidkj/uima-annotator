History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28265**] is a 78 yo female with extensive clot burden
?secondary to HIT (PE, aortic throbus, splenic infarct), SVT on
quinidine/metoprolol, renal stones, here s/p cardiac arrest. She
had reportedly been feeling well until the day before when she
complained of fatigue and was only able to walk 200 ft instead
of her regular 500 ft before feeling fatigued. She was noted on
[**2156-2-11**] at 4AM to be short of breath and then became
unresponsive. Her husband began CPR. EMS was called and
administered shocks and gave epinephrine. Response time is
unknown. He was intubated upon arrival to the [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1459**]
ED. She was found to be in SVT reportedly.

During the hospital stay, she intitially had a chest CTA which
was negative for PE. She was tachycardic and placed on an
amiodarone drip and then needed neo to support her BP. She was
initially covered broadly with vanco/zosyn/azithro without any
clear infectious source, but this was tailored to flagyl/vanco
for C. diff today. Neurology was consulted as her mental status
did not improve without sedation. They felt she opened eyes to
voice, but did not follow commands, found her PERRL, and
withdrawal to noxious stimuli. EEG was performed and showed
encephalopthay. A repeat Head CT today showed SAH so all
anticoagulation was stopped. She was placed on stress dose
steroids.

On the MICU, unable to obtain further history as patient was
intubated.

Of note, patient had recent hospital from [**1-27**] to [**2156-2-5**] where
she presented with nausea/vomiting and became hypoxic &
hypotensive in the ED, requiring pressors and intubation. She
was found to have PE and massive clot burden in body. His
suspician for HIT though negative HIT ab x 2. She has also had
ongoing AVNRT and was intiated on quinidine & lopressor per EP
recommendations.

Studies:
[**2156-2-13**] CXR:
1. Left pleural effusion.
2. Probable persistent atelectasis/consolidation in the left
lower lobe.

[**2156-2-14**] Transthoracic ECHO: The left atrium and right atrium are
normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. At study initiation (HR 150/min), there
is severe global hypokinesis (LVEF<20%) with relative
preservation of the basl inferolateral wall function.
Subsequently, the heart rate abrupty decreased to 84/;min. There
there was improved function of basal segments, with persistent
[**Last Name (un) **] hypo/near akinesis of the distal hafl of the septum and
anterior wall and apical aneurysm (LAD infarct pattern
distribution with overall LVEF 25-30%). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened/myxomatous with suggestion
of systolic prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
are bilateral pleural effusions. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2156-1-27**], left ventricular systolic
function has deteriorated and the severity of mitral
regurgitation has increased. Mild aortic regurgitation is now
identified.

[**2156-2-14**] CT HEAD: Linear foci of high attenuation are noted in
the left frontal region (2:16, 17). These may represent small
foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Remainder of the brain is
unremarkable.

[**2156-2-15**] CT HEAD: Decreased conspicuity of focus of high
attenuation in the left frontal region which may represent an
evolving very small focus of
subarachnoid hemorrhage. 2. Prominent extra-axial frontal spaces
likely represent a subdural hygroma versus old subdural
hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78 yo female with SVT, extensive clot burden (aortic,
PE, splenic infart), here s/p cardiac arrest and SAH.

1.  S/p Cardiac arrest.  Unclear precipitant of arrest.  Was
reportedly in a shockable rhythmn upon EMS arrival, so possible
torsades, ventricular arrythmia in the setting of being on
quinidine and having a prolonged qtc interval (>650) on one EKG
at OSH.  Also possibilitiy of SVT with hypotension given history
of unstable SVT.  Cardiac enzymes were not significantly
elevated at OSH so not likely to be acute MI.  Echo follow
arrest showed EF fell to 20-25 from 45% two weeks ago. She was
continued on amiodarone and then had successful ablation of
AVNRT on [**2156-2-16**] with subsequent sinus rhythm. Amiodarone was
subsequently discontinued.

2.  SVT.  Patient has narrow complex tachycardia consistent with
AVNRT.  Started on amiodarone and neo, but had been discharged 2
weeks ago with quinidine and metoprolol.  Reportly normotensive
when in sinus rhythm.  Echo shows reduced EF from prior echo
from 3 weeks ago concerning for ischemia versus tachycardia
induced cardiomyopathy. Quindine was discontinued and amiodarone
was started. Underwent successful ablation of SVT with patient
remaining in normal sinus rhythm for remainder of admission.
Amidodarone discontinued after ablation. Metoprolol IV 5mg q6
was changed to metoprolol 25mg PO BID for improved rate control.

3. Altered mental status. Very poor on admission but improved
