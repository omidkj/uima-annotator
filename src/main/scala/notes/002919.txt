Chest pain

Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4702**] is a 34M with ESRD on HD and poorly controlled blood
pressure who presents with increased SOB. Of note, he was
recently admitted [**Date range (1) 58652**] with CP in the setting of HTN
requiring ICU admission and a labetalol drip.
.
He reports that over the last weekend he had some nausea and
non-bloody emesis. Last HD was [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] his report was
uneventful. Upon return from HD he noticed that he felt short of
breath with activity. He felt discomfort in his chest "like he
was being punched" associated with palpitations. This would go
away over a few minutes if he rested. The pain was
non-radiating, and not related to position, breathing, or PO
intake. He had some associated nausea, without lightheadedness
or diaphoresis. The CP felt similar to his prior CP, in fact
less intense. Denies any fevers, chills, sweats, coughing,
abdominal or back pains. Has had some pruritis, but denies any
abnormal taste in his mouth. Had constipation over the weekend,
no diarrhea or dysuria. Reports taking all his home
antihypertensives and denies any substance use.
.
In the emergency department, initial vitals were 98.3 110
196/143 28 97% on RA -> NRB. On exam, tachypneic and wheezy. EKG
showed SR with lateral STD. CXR showed mild pulmonary edema. He
was given atrovent, aspirin 325mg, nitroglycerin, and lasix
200mg with little urine output. Started on a nitroglycerin drip.
Renal evaluated him in the ER, felt he did not urgently need HD.
98 103 169/106 31 94 on 4L, still on nitroglycerin drip, SOB and
CP improved. Access 22g PIVx1.
.
On evaluation in the MICU, he reported continued CP up to [**6-6**]
as well as a headache that started after he got nitroglycerin in
the ER.

Pertinent Results:
LABS:

CK 351 MB 4 Tropn 0.20, was 0.10 on [**4-6**]
Chem 140/4.8/96/25/69/10.9<85
INR 1.2 PTT 26.4
.
ECG: SR @82 nl axis and intervals, poor R wave progression with
deep S waves in precordial leads. <1mm STD with TWI in V6 and
vF. TWI in III more prominent today. q's in vL and I. In
comparison to [**2155-4-1**] EKG, the TWI in v6 is new (but seen
previously [**2155-3-19**])
.
STUDIES:
.
CXR
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Moderate cardiomegaly is stable
from prior. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.
Bilateral hazy air space opacities are present, with
indistinctness of the pulmonary vascularity suggestive of mild
pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions are seen. There is no
pneumothorax. Rounded calcification within the right upper
quadrant is unchanged from prior which was previously noted to
be a calcified renal mass.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild pulmonary edema.
2. Unchanged cardiomegaly.
3. Unchanged calcified lesion in the right upper quadrant
corresponding to a calcified renal mass seen on previous CT from
[**2155-3-18**].
.
CTA chest [**4-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus. No aortic dissection.
2. Diffuse ground-glass opacity with air trapping at bases
suggests small airways disease and/or poor respiratory effort.
Mild pulmonary edema.
3. Right chest wall collaterals suggest stenosis, occlusion of
the right subclavian vein.
4. Persistent coronary artery calcifications.
5. Stable appearance of calcified right renal mass.
6. Pulmonary hypertension given enlarged diameter of pulmonary
artery.
7. Dilated ascending aorta, stable from prior.
8. Stable cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
* Hypertensive urgency
Chest pain in setting of marked hypertension with abnormal EKG
consistent with  hypertensive emergency. He has had multiple
admissions for similar complaints. The reason for these repeated
presentations is not certain but according to [**Name (NI) **] pt has history
of poor medication compliance. Given ESRD, volume is likely a
contributor to his hypertension but renal team feels that HD not
needed emergently. Patient was started on labetalol gtt then
transitioned to PO meds with better BP control.

* Chest discomfort
[**Month (only) 116**] have cardiac ischemia in setting of marked hypertension.
Think a primary plaque rupture event is less likely. Patient
said he would not be able to take daily medication (including
plavix) even knowing the risk of blood clot without it. So he
was deemed not to be an appropriate candidate for stress test
since, if positive, he would not comply with therapy that would
be needed after therapeutic catheterization. Was continued on
[**Month (only) **], imdur, and statin. Also not a candidate for beta blocker
given cocaine abuse. Cardiac enzymes were checked and trended
down from 0.20->0.15 (baseline for him). He had a follow up
appointment in cardiology on the day of discharge and was
discharged in time to make it to that appointment for further
discussion of the best management of his presumed coronary
artery disease.

* Nausea
[**Month (only) 116**] have been from coronary ischemia in setting of
HTN-emergency. Resolved with BP control and HD. KUB was WNL.

* ESRD on HD. Received dialysis [**2155-4-23**]. Unclear how often he
has been going to HD as outpatient although he reported going to
HD on Friday prior to admission. He was continued on phos
binders.
