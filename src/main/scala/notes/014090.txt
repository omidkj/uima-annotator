CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS; CT BRAIN
PERFUSION- IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage.

MRI/A/V - MRA shows no evidence of stenosis, aneurysm, occlusion
or dissection.
Fenestration of the proximal basilar artery is again noted.

MRV shows no evidence of thrombosis of the dural sinuses. There
is a
hypoplastic right transverse sinus.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute infarct.
2. No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis.
3. Fenestration of the proximal basilar artery in an otherwise
normal MRA of the brain.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of her headache s/p
code stroke. Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 83 y/o woman with acute onset of
headache with transcortical motor aphasia now back at her
baseline. Her headache was thought to be due to hypertensive
emergency. MRI/MRA/MRV brain showed no evidence of infarct,
intracranial bleeding including SAH, or cerebral venous
thrombossis. She had no evidence of infection, including no
fever or nuchal rigidity. HTN emergency seems to fit both the
clinical presentation and progression, particularly in the
context of her recent
changes in BP medications. There was no evidence of posterior
reversible leukoencephalopathy or pseudotumor cerebri on imaging
studies. Pt was transferred to the floor and blood pressure,
glucose and INR were monitored. Cellcept continued for her
bulleous pemphigoid. Pt was transferred to the floor.
Her avapro is to be held until [**2156-6-20**]. Her HCTZ was held until
day of discharge. Pt was switched from a short acting Beta
blocker to a long acting Beta blocker, atenolol.
