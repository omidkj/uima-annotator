Admission Date:  [**2134-4-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2134-5-3**]

Date of Birth:   [**2062-5-6**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Coronary Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Retroperitoneal hematoma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
female with right carotid stenosis of 70% to 80% and 3-vessel
coronary artery disease initially admitted to CMI Service and
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit Service with a
retroperitoneal hematoma status post catheterization.

On a routine workup, Ms. [**Known lastname 122**] was found to have right
carotid stenosis of 70% to 80% and was then referred to
Vascular Surgery for a carotid endarterectomy.  During a
preoperative workup for the carotid endarterectomy she was
found to have a positive cardiac stress test.

She underwent cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital
on [**2134-4-23**] which revealed 3-vessel coronary artery
disease with a 99% ostial right coronary artery lesion, an
80% lesion at the bifurcation of the mid left anterior
descending artery, as well as a 70% to 80% occlusion of the
left circumflex to first obtuse marginal.

The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2134-4-26**] for an angioplasty and stenting of the
right coronary artery which was unsuccessful.  Of note, on
cardiac catheterization moderate-to-severe diffuse left iliac
disease was seen.

Status post procedure, the patient experienced multiple
episodes of hypotension with systolic blood pressures down to
the 70s, requiring a total of 2.5 liters of normal saline
boluses to maintain her blood pressure.  An emergent
computerized axial tomography of the abdomen and pelvis
revealed extraperitoneal blood within the pelvis with a right
groin hematoma, and she was transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit Service for observation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Hypertension.
 2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 3.  Hypothyroidism.
 4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
 5.  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
 6.  Right carotid stenosis of 80% to 90% with left carotid
stenosis of about 40%.
 7.  Motor vehicle accident in [**2116**] with fractured pelvis,
ribs, and a liver laceration at that time.
 8.  Question of liver dysfunction.
 9.  Status post hysterectomy.
10.  Status post cataract surgery.
11.  Arthritis of the bilateral hips.
12.  Claudication of the bilateral calves.
13.  Dyspepsia.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

medications were)
1.  Home medications.
2.  Tylenol as needed.
3.  Oxazepam.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination, her vital signs revealed temperature was 98.5,
blood pressure was 123/47, heart rate was 80, respiratory
rate was 16, and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.
Mucous membranes were moist.  No jugular venous pressure.
The neck was obese.  Bilateral basilar crackles anteriorly.
Heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart
sounds and second heart sounds.  A 3/6 systolic murmur at the
base.  Bilateral carotid bruits.  The abdomen was soft and
obese with mild tenderness in the lower quadrant.  No edema
in her extremities with palpable femoral pulses and palpable
dorsalis pedis pulses.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
revealed her hematocrit was 36 at [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital and
dropped to 31.9 status post catheterization and subsequently
dropped to 24.2.  Other laboratory data revealed white blood
cell count was 13.7 and platelets were 238.  Differential
with 79% neutrophils, 6% bands, and 11% lymphocytes.  INR was
1.1.  Sodium was 133, potassium was 4.2, chloride was 101,
bicarbonate was 23, blood urea nitrogen was 13, creatinine
was 0.8, and blood glucose was 110.  Calcium was 7.5,
phosphate was 3.6, and magnesium was 1.8.  ALT was 41, AST
was 40, LDH was 236, alkaline phosphatase was 54, total
bilirubin was 0.3.  Fibrinogen was 240.  Urinalysis revealed
trace protein; otherwise negative.  Albumin was 3.3.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for monitoring of the retroperitoneal hematoma and
for blood transfusions.

A right internal jugular cordis was placed for access and for
large volume transfusions in case the patient's hematocrit
continued to drop.  She received 5 units of packed red blood
cells for a hematocrit of 24.2 with her hematocrit
subsequently rising to 33.3.  However, her hematocrit
continued to drift down to 27.5 and subsequently required
more transfusions.  Throughout the hospital course, the
patient received 8 units of packed red blood cells with a
stable hematocrit for the last three days of her hospital
course.  Her discharge hematocrit was ranging from 36 to
37.6.

During her hospital course, on [**2134-4-27**], the patient
developed an ischemic left leg with complaints of pain in her
left leg.  Popliteal, dorsalis pedis pulses, and posterior
tibialis pulses were not dopplerable.  There was a biphasic
femoral pulse.  The patient also developed hypotension with a
drop in her hematocrit, and a bump in her troponin to 2.5,
and a bump in her creatine kinase to 226.

The patient was seen by Vascular Surgery and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in
Interventional Cardiology who took her to the Catheterization
Laboratory and to the operating room.

In the Catheterization Laboratory, angiography showed
mild-to-moderate disease at the aortic bifurcation and ostium
of the common iliac artery.  External iliac artery and
internal iliac artery showed mild atherosclerosis.  There was
a long tubular 80% ulcerated lesion in the common iliac
artery with 30% occlusion at the bifurcation.  In the common
femoral artery there was a filling defect consistent with
thrombus.  The ostial left common iliac artery was stented
with good results.

She was taken to the operating room for exploration of the
left groin.  A left femoral endarterectomy was performed, and
a Dacron patch was placed with angioplasty of the left
femoral artery by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Postoperatively, the patient had good peripheral pulses and
remained stable.  However, she developed a cellulitis of the
left groin at the surgical site on Keflex.  Her antibiotic
regimen was switched from Keflex to vancomycin with a good
response.  Due to the need for a 7-day course of vancomycin
status post discharge, the patient required a peripherally
inserted central catheter line.  A bedside peripherally
inserted central catheter line was unable to be placed.  The
patient received a peripherally inserted central catheter
line by Interventional Radiology for vancomycin.

She also developed left lower extremity edema and received a
lower extremity Doppler that was negative for deep venous
thrombosis.  It was felt that her edema was likely due to
inflammation and poor lymphatic drainage from due to the
cellulitis and inflammation.

While in house, she was also seen by Cardiothoracic Surgery
for a coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Due to her
retroperitoneal bleed it was thought to be wise to defer her
coronary artery bypass graft and her carotid endarterectomy
for one month until her bleeding stabilized.

She also underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate
her cardiac function.  It showed a left ventricular ejection
fraction of greater or equal to 70% with normal wall motion.
The left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size were both
normal.  She had 1+ aortic regurgitation.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged in stable
condition.  The patient  was to finish her course of
vancomycin
