HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old male who
presented with new shortness of breath in early [**Month (only) **] of this
year.  An echocardiogram at an outside hospital showed new
dilated cardiomyopathy.

He first noted symptoms on approximately the [**Hospital1 107**] Day
weekend.  He described his symptoms as similar to asthmatic
symptoms.  This progressed to severe orthopnea, a symptom he
had no previously had causing him to sit upright and gasp for
breath at night.  He used his friend's albuterol nebulizers
with minimal improvement.  He denies lower extremity edema.
His shortness of breath at this point was severely limiting
his activity, walking 20 to 30 feet with severe dyspnea.  He
felt better leaning forward.  He also describes decreased
appetite.

At the beginning of [**Month (only) **] he saw his primary care physician
who felt he was having an asthma exacerbation and gave him
intravenous Solu-Medrol, and the patient relayed a vague
story of going into sinus tachycardia with a heart rate in
the 120s, a fingerstick in the 500s, been sent to the
Emergency Department and admitted to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital.
A chest x-ray showed a question of a left upper lobe
pneumonia.  He was given intravenous antibiotics; ceftriaxone
and azithromycin.  He was discharged from that hospital on
[**7-7**].  An echocardiogram during that admission showed
global hypokinesis, 4-chamber dilatation, an ejection
fraction of 10% to 15%.  There were no previous
echocardiograms.

The patient denies antecedent upper respiratory infection or
recent diarrheal illness.  No rash.  No joint pains.  Denies
a history of exertional chest pain, previous orthopnea, or
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.

In the week between discharge from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital and
admission to [**Hospital1 69**] he felt
better with decreased dyspnea on exertion, increased exercise
tolerance, and decreased lower extremity edema.  His blood
pressure previously had been 130s to 190s; he would take it
at work.  His cholesterol status is unknown.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy.
2.  Moderate mitral regurgitation.
3.  Global hypokinesis.
4.  Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
5.  Elevated liver function tests.
6.  Asthma; no previous steroids.
7.  Pneumonia, status post ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Azmacort, NPH insulin 25 units
q.a.m. and 10 units q.p.m., a course of Ceftin (ended on
[**7-14**]).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives in [**Location (un) 23708**].  He has a human
immunodeficiency virus positive partner (female), positive
tobacco history times 20 years, previous heavy drinker (now
social), very remote cocaine use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   One uncle with coronary artery disease and
a sister with Grave's disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Pulse of 114, blood
pressure of 122/88, 98% on room air. In general, he was a
large man, in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat showed extraocular muscles were intact.  Pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  The oropharynx was
clear without lesions, 10 cm of jugular venous distention in
the neck.  Lungs were clear to auscultation without crackles;
however, decreased air movement was noted bilaterally.  Heart
was fourth heart sound and first heart sound and second heart
sound regular without murmurs.  The abdomen was obese.
Sacral and abdominal wall edema.  Bowel sounds were present.
It was soft.  Extremities showed 4+ edema, warm.  Neurologic
examination was nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count of 9.7, hematocrit of 39, mean cell volume of 88,
platelets of 251.  Blood urea nitrogen of 16, creatinine
of 0.8, glucose of 168.  AST of 79, ALT of 340,
thyroid-stimulating hormone of 0.9, alkaline phosphatase
of 186, albumin of 3.2, total bilirubin of 1.2.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Liver ultrasound from the outside
hospital showed fatty infiltrate, no ascites, bilateral
pleural effusions, normal portal flow.

Transthoracic echocardiogram at the outside hospital on
[**7-6**] showed dilated left atrium of 5.6 cm, dilated left
ventricle with severe global hypokinesis, ejection fraction
of 10% to 15%, moderate mitral regurgitation, dilated right
ventricle with moderate global dysfunction, mild tricuspid
regurgitation, pulmonary artery pressure in the 30s.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was noted to be in severe
heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy based on the
outside hospital records, the etiology of which was unclear.

He was sent to the catheterization laboratory which revealed
a middle left anterior descending artery lesion of 80%,
status post stent.  The right coronary artery was totally
occluded.  The left circumflex had a moderate ostial lesion
which was not intervened upon.  His pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 35 mmHg to 40 mmHg.  His cardiac index was
1.4 L/kg/min/m2.

After catheterization, the patient was taken to the Coronary
Care Unit with an intra-aortic balloon pump and was diuresed
approximately 15 liters in the Coronary Care Unit with
intravenous Lasix.  He was transferred back to the Cardiology
Service for continued diuresis.  He was started on a heart
failure regimen of captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d., Lasix 120 mg
p.o. b.i.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d., carvedilol 3.125 mg
p.o. b.i.d.  He was also started on a statin, Lipitor 10 mg
p.o. q.d.

He was seen by the Electrophysiology Service for the
possibility of receiving a prophylactic automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator.  Given the fact that this was not
an ischemic cardiomyopathy, it was felt that it was not
indicated at this point.

2.  DIABETES:  He was continued on his diabetic regimen.

3.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  Electrolytes were
repleted on a p.r.n. basis given his aggressive ongoing
diuresis.

4.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient remained on the
Cardiology Service as of [**7-18**].  An addendum to this
Discharge Summary will be dictated by the incoming intern.
