History of Present Illness:
66 year old man with CAD, s/p IMI in [**3-5**] with stent to Cx c/b
cardiogenic [**Date Range **] requiring IABP, repeat cath in [**10-5**] with
Taxus stents to ISR of Cx and stenting of LAD. Last cath [**11-5**]
for recurrent CP-No intervention at that time w/widely patent
stents and non-critical CAD. Pt was readmitted to [**Hospital1 2519**] on [**12-20**] with pulmonary edema, he was diuresed and
ruled out for MI. Has since been diuresed but creatinine has
risen to 2.3 (was 2.0 on admission***creatinine on [**11-5**]: 1.3).
Pt presented to [**Hospital3 **] [**1-21**] morning for increasing SOB,
chest congestion and cough. Pt awoke in USOH but noticed
increasing SOB in particular while ambulating to bathroom, wife
called 911, EMS transported pt to local hosp. Pt also states
that he's had L scapular pain daily while having a BM. During
this admission at OSH he was found to have pulm edema and
diuresed 40IV lasix x1 w/resolving SOB. ETT on [**1-22**]: + ST
depression in the lateral leads with exercise. Imaging: results
w/ischemia. LVEF quoted as 45%. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
cath given ETT results and recurrent pulm edema and L scapular
CP, also new ARF.

Pertinent Results:
[**2148-1-30**] CXR: There is new near complete opacification of the
left hemithorax with tracheal deviation to the left, tenting of
the left hemidiaphragm suggesting volume loss. A left pleural
effusion has also increased in size since prior exam. The right
lung is clear, and appears hyperinflated. Postoperative changes
consistent with patient's known AVR, MVR and median sternotomy
are again seen.
[**2148-1-26**] Echo: POSTBYPASS: LV systolic function is slighly worse
compared (~40%) to prebypass. RV systolic function remains
preserved. There is a well seated, well functioning
bioprosthesis in the aortic position. There is trace valvular
AI. There is a well seated well functioning bioprosthesis in the
mitral position. There is a mild perivalvular leak laterally.
[**2148-1-26**] Cath: Selective coronary angiography of this left
dominant system revealed left main coronary artery disease, with
a 70% ostial stenosis of the LMCA. The LAD had widely patent
stents and mild luminal irregularities. The LCx also had widely
patent stents and a 50% stenosis at the origin of the PL branch.
 The RCA was not ingaged as it was known to be a small,
nondominant vessel and without significant disease. Limited
resting hemodynamics revealed a central aortic pressure of
105/53mmHG. Pressure wire interrogation of LMCA lesion revealed
a resting FFR of 0.76 with catheter damping, signifying a
hemodynamically significant stenosis.
[**2148-1-25**] Renal Angio: Central aortic hypertension. Moderate, non
critical lesion in the LRA.
[**2148-1-24**] MRA Kidneys: Mild-to-moderate (likely less than 50%)
bilateral nonostial, proximal renal artery stenoses. Multiple
bladder diverticula.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with atypical chest pain, congestive
heart failure, supraventricular tachycardia and renal
insufficiency. He underwent renal MRA to evaluate for renal
artery stenosis.  The MRA revealed that in both renal arteries,
there was mild-to-moderate nonostial proximal stenosis. The
estimated stenoses was less than 50%. Follow up renal
angiography on [**1-25**] showed no significant disease on the
right with a 40% ostial stenosis in the left. No intervention
was performed and medical management was recommended for his
hypertension. Given episodes of supraventricular tachycardia,
the EP service was consulted. Beta blockade was advanced and an
echocardiogram was obtained. The echocardiogram showed mild
aortic stenosis with 1-2+ aortic insuffiency. There was [**1-2**]+
mitral regurgitation with normal left ventricular function. The
LVEF was estimated between 60-65%. He remained relatively stable
on medical therapy with gradual improvement in renal function.
He eventually underwent coronary angiography which showed a left
dominant system and a hemodynamically significant 70% ostial
lesion in the left main coronary artery disease. The LAD had
widely patent stents and mild luminal irregularities. The LCx
also had widely patent stents and a 50% stenosis at the origin
of the PL branch.  The RCA was not ingaged as it was known to be
a
small, nondominant vessel and without significant disease. Given
the hemodynamically significant critical left main lesion, he
was urgently brought to the operating room for surgical
intervention. In the operating room, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed four
vessel coronary artery bypass grafting along with aortic and
mitral valve replacments. For surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation, he
was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. Post
operatively his platelets dropped to 43, a HIT panel was sent
and was negative. He developed a second degree AV block for
which he was seen by EP and remained in the ICU, and his
epicardial pacing wires remained. He also required extensive
pulmonary toilet. He went into atrial fibrillation on POD #6 and
was transferred to the floor. His epicardial wires were dc'd on
POD #8. He was started on couadmin for afib. His INR rose
rapidly to a peak of 9, his coumadin was held and his INR
quickly returned to a therapeutic level. A CXR was done prior to
discharge which showed a new moderatd sized right pneumothorax.
Repeat CXR x 2 showed no change and he was discharged home on
POD #11.
