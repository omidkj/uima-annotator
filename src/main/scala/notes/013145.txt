History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 32299**] is a 67 year old man with a history of CAD s/p MI x
3, with known two [**Name14 (STitle) 12425**] CAD, ischemic CM with EF 35%, s/p ICD
initially for primary prevention that subsequently developed
multpile episodes of VT with multiple ablations, most recent
[**2178**], h/o slow VT treated with mexiletine and amiodarone (off
mex for 1 month) who presents with left lateral chest pain.
Patient c/o two days of epigastric burning that he was
contributing to reflux. However, on morning of admission patient
awoke in a cold sweat with chest pressure in substernal area. He
describes this as somewhat similar to his previous anginal pain,
but much more mild in nature. Pain has radiated at times to his
left shoulder and right shoulder.
.
On arrival in the ED vials: T 97 HR 109 , BP 110/83 , RR 16, O2
97 % RA. He was given three 81 mg ASA, Simethicone, Maalox,
Viscous lidocaine. Patient noted to have an episode of CP in the
ED with relief by SL NTG x 1. Initial ECG c/w slow VT, now in SR
with LBBB. CXR with ?atelectasis RLL. Hemodynamically stable.
.
On arrival to the general cardiology floor patient remained with
chest pain (apparently may never have been c/p free in ED). Was
started on nitro gtt with chest pain increased from [**4-23**] to
[**6-23**]. Patient described some radiation to the back and was given
2mg of morphine with improvement in his pain at that time (but
not resolution). Was taken for CTA scan of the chest at that
point to rule-out dissection/PE. Post-scan he was brought to the
CCU for monitoring.

Past Medical History:
- severe ischemic cardiomyopathy secondary to old inferolateral
wall MI
- CAD s/p MI x 3 (age 39, 42, 45)
- ICD implantation initially for primary prevention of sudden
cardiac
death, developed recurrent ventricular tachycardia status post
multiple ablation, most recent VT ablation in [**2179-6-15**],
complicated by laceration of the right iliac artery and
significant retroperitoneal hematoma
- H/O slow VT suppressed in a combination of amiodarone and
mexiletine
- H/O GERD and Barrett's esophagus
- hyperlipidemia
- hypertention
- amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis with subsequent development
of hypothyroidism: risk of recurrence approximately 10%,
endocrine evaluated pt in past and thought it was OK to restart;
currently on amiodarone.
- CKD with baseline Cr 1.4

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current or past
tobacco use. There is no history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death, but his his 2 brothers are both in their 60's
and suffer from CAD, his father had multiple MIs and a CVA in
his 80's.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 69 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy, two
[**Month/Day/Year 12425**] CAD, p/w known slow VT and chest pain.

VT: Likely [**1-16**] scar from underlying ischemic disease. VT
resolved spontaneously in ED. Pt had been off mexiletene for 1
month due to limited supply. Restarted on mexilitene, with no
further VT, as well as amniodorone.Supply confirmed with
patient's pharmacy.
.
Chest Pain: Pt was initially on ngt/heparin drip but ruled out
for  MI with negative biomarkers. Did have 1 episode of CP in
ICU with 1mm ST elevation and T wave changes, resolved with
morphine. ICD evaluated but did not show any misfiring as pt has
experienced in past resulting in CP. Majority of CP episodes
seem related to severe gerd for which he was treated with
pantoprazole, ranitidine, sucralfate and GI cocktail PRN. Pt did
have known hx of Lcx, LAD lesions which had not been intervened
upon. He received a thallium viability study to evaluate the
myocardium supplied by these coronary vessels which showed that
these areas were infarcted and thus non viable.
.
Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: EF 35%. Pt noted to have bibasilar
crackles on exam,
with peripheral edema. He received IV lasix with good response
and became euvolemic.
.
GERD: hx severe GERD likely etiology repeated episodes CP. GERD
controlled with multidrug regimen at home of pantoprazole,
ranitidine, sucralfate with GI cocktail PRN given inhouse. Pt to
follow up with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] as o/p.
.
.# Respiratory: On admission, pt was Tachypneic with hypoxemia.
CTA chest ruled out PE but did show sabre shear trachea
consistent with obstructive lung disease which should be
followed up as o/p by PCP.
.
#. L femoral bruit: pt with L femoral bruit after L groin
arterial access with AV fistula on US. CT pelvis with no fistula
but aneurysm. Per [**Name10 (NameIs) 1106**] surgery, OK to use L groin site for
catheterization. No intervention planned at this time. A plan
was made for him to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] with ultrasound at
that time.
