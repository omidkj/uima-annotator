.
L hip XRAY: Left femur, AP and lateral on [**2135-10-17**]; since
[**2135-10-16**], patient is status post placement of three [**Doctor Last Name 33754**] pins
transfixing the left femoral subcapital fracture. There is also
a new intramedullary rod transfixing a comminuted fracture of
the mid femur shaft. Distal fracture fragement is laterally and
posteriorly displaced. No evidence for hardware loosening. A
large suprapatellar joint effusion is present. Postoperative
edema, emphysema and skin staples are noted.
.
R knee XRAY: Frontal and lateral views of the right knee
demonstrate generalized osteopenia. There are some mild
degenerative changes and vascular calcifications. No fracture is
identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Hip/femoral fracture: The patient sustained a L femoral neck
and comminuted midshaft fracture during her mechanical fall at
home.  Pain control was achieved with morphine.  Cardiology
evaluation revealed that the patient was of moderate risk for a
medium risk procedure, and the patient was cleared for surgery.
The patient was taken to the OR where a left hip ORIF was
performed, with good postoperative result.  The patient continue
to complain of pain in the RLE, particularly the knee.  Plain
films of the right knee revealed no fracture, although there was
a question of ligamentous laxity with valgus force on
orthopedics examination.  The patient could not get a right knee
MRI due to her pacemaker.  The patient was fitted with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
brace to the right knee, which improved her ability to
weight-bear.  Lovenox was used for postoperative DVT
prophylaxis, and should be continued for 6 weeks
postoperatively.  The patient was discharged to rehab for
strength, balance, and functional mobility training, with
touch-down weightbearing to the LLE.  Pain control was acheieved
on discharge with Percocet.  Several days prior to discharge,
the patient suffered a fall from bed.  Head CT was negative, and
hip films revealed no interval changes to the postoperative
sites.
.
#. Fever: early in the postoperative period the patient spiked a
temperature to 101.9.  A urine culture and urinalysis was
checked and was unremarkable.  A CXR was performed that revealed
a questionable L retrocardiac opacity.  The patient was judged
to be a large aspiration risk as well, and so Levaquin and
Flagyl were started.  The fevers improved on this regimen, and
the patient was discharged with instructions to complete a 7 day
course.
.
#. Pulmonary nodules: The patient is in the process of having an
outpatient workup performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] for her
pulmonary nodules.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] was made aware of the
patient being in house.  Further work-up is deferred until the
current medical problem has been stabilized.
.
#. DM type 2: The patient's outpatient oral hypoglycemic regimen
was held on admission, and the patient was placed on a regular
insulin sliding scale.  The patient had good glucose control on
this regimen during her hospitalization.  The patient was
restarted on her usual outpatient oral regimen on discharge.
.
#. Cardiovascular: The patient was continued on her home regimen
of [**Last Name (LF) 17339**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and lopressor during her stay.  She was also
given her usual dose of PO lasix.  No changes were made to this
regimen during her stay.  Because she received several units of
blood and IV hydration in the early postoperative period, IV
lasix was used to maintain slightly negative I/O ratio.
.
#. Afib: The patient has atrial pacing on her PM.  Amiodarone
was continued per her usual outpatient regimen.  No changes were
made to her regimen during her stay.  Precautions were taken in
the operating room by anesthesiology given her prolonged use of
amiodarone.
