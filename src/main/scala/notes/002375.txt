Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13565**]
Chief Complaint:
Falls - found to have R cerebellar hemorrhage at OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 61509**] is a LHM, and is a retired printer (former veteran),
who normally does cross-word puzzles, Sodoku and plays Game Boy.
He was in his usual state of health until 3 am on [**10-24**]. His
step-son, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 36913**], whom he lives with, found him sitting
by the front door, drenched in blood, and trying to get out. Mr
[**Name13 (STitle) 36913**] cleaned his step-father up, and noticed that he had hit
the right side of his forehead and right forearm. Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 36913**]
took his father back to bed, at around 4 am. Mr [**Known lastname 61509**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] up
around 6:30 am, and had breakfast around 7 am which consisted of
his usual bowl of cereal and two cups of coffee. Mr [**Known lastname 79898**]
daughter-in-law [**Doctor First Name **] noticed that he had made a mess in the
kitchen earlier that morning, taken the kitchen rug and tried to
wrap the table in it. However, both Mr and Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) 36913**] left for
work, requesting their daughter ([**Name (NI) **]) to look in on Mr
[**Name (NI) 61509**]. [**Doctor First Name **] came by to give Mr [**Known lastname 61509**] lunch, and
found that there was more blood in the house, in addition, he
had vomited his breakfast up on the living room sofa. She
noticed that while he was eating his bowl of soup, his soup
spoon kept missing his mouth. In addition, she noticed that her
grand-father's speech was slurred. [**Doctor First Name **] took her Grand-father
to the [**Hospital3 **] [**Name (NI) **]. He had a CT of his brain which
showed a right cerebellar hemorrhagic lesion with vasogenic
edema and some compression of the fourth ventricle, so he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. At the ED he was reviewed by
Neurosurgery.

Review of systems: Apart from headache, the rest of his systems
review was apparently negative.

Past Medical History:
1. Asthma
2. Osteoporosis
3. Osteoarthritis
4. s/p bilateral catarect surgery

Social History:
Lives with his step-son who is his only child and his HCP, his
name is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 36913**] and his cell phone number is: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79899**]. According to Mr [**Last Name (Titles) 36913**], his step-father is DNR/DNI. His
PCP is Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 27542**] at [**Location (un) **]. He is an
ex-smoker, smoking up to two packs per day (not known over the
number of years). Mr [**Known lastname 61509**] does not drink alcohol. His bedroom
is on the [**Location (un) 1773**], and he normally manages his ADLs.

General: right forehead and right arm bruises noted.
HEENT: complained that it tickled when trying to examine the
cervical lymph nodes.

Neurological Examination
Mental status: Awake and alert, multiple promptings for the
exam. Oriented to person, [**Location (un) 86**] and [**2107**]. Normal repetition; no
anomia. Moderate dysarthria. Registers 0/3,recalls 0/3 in 5
minutes. Right-left confusion.

Cranial Nerves: Fundoscopic examination kept closing his eyes
tightly. Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3 to 2
mmbilaterally. Visual fields appear to be full to confrontation,
but he is easily distractible. Extraocular movements intact
bilaterally with nystagmus to the right. Sensation appears to
beintact V1-V3. Facial movements are symmetric. Palate
elevationsymmetric. Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius full
strength bilaterally. Tongue midline.

Motor: Decreased bulk diffusely but normal tone bilaterally. No
observed myoclonus, asterixis, or tremor. No pronator drift.
Full strength in all muscles tested.

Sensory testing was totally unreliable.

Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric throughout. Positive Babinski on the
right.

Coordination: Normal finger-nose-finger, heel to shin, and fine
finger movements.

Gait: Unsafe on his feet very unsteady

EKG [**10-24**]: Sinus bradycardi.  Left bundle branch block

CT head:
1. 1.5 cm hyperdense lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere,
with
surrounding edema, and mild effacement of the fourth ventricle.
Differential considerations include hyperdense or hemorrhagic
metastasis, versus vascular malformation, or other source of
hemorrhage, including hypertensive bleed. MRI with contrast is
recommended for further evaluation.

2. 1.3 cm probable small calcified meningioma right middle
cranial fossa.
This could also be more definitively characterized by MRI.

3. Vascular calcifications, and bilateral basal ganglia chronic
lacunar
infarcts, and right frontal chronic infarction.

MR head: Approximately 1.5-cm lesion in the right cerebellar
hemisphere
with surrounding edema most consistent with a hemorrhagic tumor.
Adjacent
enhancement in the cerebellar sulci may be leptomeningeal
seeding from a
tumor. These findings are most consistent with a malignant
hemorrhagic tumor.

MRI Brain [**10-24**]: FINDINGS: There is a well-defined hyperintense
lesion within the right cerebellar hemisphere, measuring
approximately 15 x 12 mm. T1-weighted imaging shows
inhomogeneous signal with a surrounding dark ring. Gradient-echo
sequence shows the lesion to be hypointense. There is a large
area of surrounding edema. On post-contrast images, there is
uniform enhancement of the dura. There is also enhancement of
the cerebellar sulci which could signify leptomeningeal seeding
from a tumor.
IMPRESSION: Approximately 1.5-cm lesion in the right cerebellar
hemisphere with surrounding edema most consistent with a
hemorrhagic tumor. Adjacent enhancement in the cerebellar sulci
may be leptomeningeal seeding from a tumor. These findings are
most consistent with a malignant hemorrhagic tumor.

MRI Brain [**11-7**]: Prelim read: Large decrease in mass effect of
right cerebellar mass on fourth ventricle since MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**10-24**]
with small improvement in mass effect seen since head CT of
[**11-4**].


Brief Hospital Course:
