Admission Chest X ray: unremarkable
.
EGD: [**2196-4-2**] - [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear (injection, thermal
therapy, ligation). Blood in the stomach. Recommendations: High
dose (double dose) PPI, Surgical consultation. There is no
further endoscopic treatment for this lesion if he rebleeds.
Serial HCT, continue to transfuse, reverse coagulopathy, ICU
care.
.
[**2196-4-6**]  GI BLEEDING STUDY - IMPRESSION: No visible source of
GI bleed.
.
EKG: 76 afib, LAD, IVCD, strain pattern V4-6, AVL, I,  V5-AVL
deeper than priors, V4 strain new.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 y/o M w/ CAD and AFib on Coumadin and ASA, s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
tear with BRBPR and NSTEMI
.
UPPER GI BLEED: Pt was admitted to the MICU. EGD on [**2196-4-1**]
without active bleeding, but f/u EGD [**2196-4-2**] with [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
tear s/p injection, thermal therapy, and ligation. He recieved a
total of 9U of PRBC's, the last on [**2196-4-2**] with stable Hct. He
was c/o of the MICU on [**2196-4-5**], and was noted to have several
episodes of BRBPR the following day. He was orthostatic to BP
60/p, and there was concern for re-bleeding of [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
tear. He was transferred back to the MICU. NGT lavage was
negative for blood, and f/u bleeding scan was negative. The
patient did not have any further episodes of melena or BRBPR,
and Hct remained stable throughout the remainder of his stay. He
will f/u with GI for repeat EGD and colonoscopy.
.
CARDIOLOGY - Pt was noted to have NSTEMI with increased troponin
of 0.63 and peak CK of 286, felt to be related to stress in pt
pt with known CAD and UGIB. His cardiac enzymes trended down. He
was continued on BB and statin. After cardiology consult,
patient will have oupt stress. He will restart ASA therapy [**4-13**].
He also has a history of afib and coumadin was held in the
setting of GIB. He will need to discuss restarting Couamdin as
outpatient.
.
HTN/orthostasis - Will hold OP meds given orthostatic
hypotension from hypovolemia. Restarted Carvedilol. Pt
aggressively hydrated and dizziness improved.

Endocrine - on levoxyl

CRI- stable with Cr 1.5. Likely secondary to HTN.
