History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6099**] is a 45 yo RH man with a PMH significant for HTN (diet
controlled) and HLD p/w new onset headache. His headache started
around 8 to 10:00 am on 04 25 09. It was localized in both
temples, of progressive nature, she cannot tell if throbbing or
of pressure quality. He was not unsteady. He had no evident
dysmetria or diplopia, no dysphagia. He took ibuprofen 800 mg
with mild response. He does not have a history of previous
headaches.

He spent the day in bed. During the night he slept comfortably.
On 04 26 09 he woke up nauseated and finally vomited several
times from 6 to 8:00 am. His wife recalls that his headache did
not improve after his emesis episodes. He could have a
conversation and follow commands at that time. However, a few
hours later (2:00 pm), his wife noticed he was "mumbling", and
could not engage on a regular conversation. He did not follow
her commands, hence she called EMS.

EMS assessed the pt at 3:34 pm. He was following simple
commands, his RIGHT eye was deviated upward  in ABD his LEFT eye
was at midline as per EMS report. He was "decorticating" with
the RIGHT arm and had a LEFT facial droop. Eventually, he
developed a symptomatic bradycardia with decreased mental status
(HR<40). He then received naloxone 1mg iv, but his his mental
status did not improve and required atropine 0.5 mg. He
responded well with a HR> 50 bpm and following commands again.
His VS where 120/ 80, 56 bpm, 16RR.  EMS reports LEFT eye upgaze
and ABD and RIGHT eye at midline at this point. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 46**] Med. Center ED.

Once at [**Hospital1 46**], he required endotracheal intubation (received
Etomidate 20 mg iv, succinylcholine 100 mg iv, versed 2 mg iv
and was started on a propofol drip), given his depressed mental
status. There is no reference to FSG values. a CT CNS W/o
contrast was performed and read as normal. He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Once at [**Hospital1 18**] ED: VS: 100.0F, 62 bpm, 141/ 82, on Vent: CMV FIO2
50%, RR 18, TV 500 cc, PPeak 18, PEEP 5. He received decadron 10
mg iv, ceftriaxone 2 g iv, Vanc 1 g iv, acyclovir 800 mg iv. He
also received fentanyl and was continued on a propofol drip.

ROS: no sick contacts, no recent trips. His daughter had
[**Name2 (NI) 82210**] syndrome in [**Month (only) **] (admitted at CH for 3 weeks). His
dog recently died (not of an infectious process). He has had no
fevers. He does not use drugs. Rest of ROS is negative.

Physical Exam:

500 cc, PPeak 18, PEEP 5

below).

use.

Neurologic examination: 5 minutes off propofol.

No meningismus.

MS:Responsive to noxious stimuli: it seems that he initially
extensor postures with the arms, but he then withdraws from
pain, though he cannot localize it. The legs move spontaneously.


CN:  Corneals + bl. Pupils 2 to 1 bl and symmetrically. There is
No gaze deviation. However, when I attempted to perform dolls

IMAGING:
CT Head ([**5-15**]): IMPRESSION:
Relative hypodensity with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation in the left occipital region and right
cerebellum concerning for infarcts of indeterminate age, acute
versus subacute. Given multiple foci, embolic etiologies are
included on the differential diagnosis. An MRI is recommended
for further characterization. Ethmoid and maxillary sinus
disease.

TTE ([**5-16**]): The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
