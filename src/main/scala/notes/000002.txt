[**8-29**]
CT head - Multiple foci of parenchymal hemorrhage as well as
small amount
of likely subarachnoid hemorrhage. The location of some of these
foci at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter interface is concerning for
diffuse axonal injury
CT Cspine - No fracture or traumatic malalignment in the
cervical spine
CT torso - Extensive pulmonary contusions, worse on the right
than the left. Hepatic lacerations with a small amount of
abdominal and pelvic free fluid of intermittent density.
Bilateral rib fractures.
Right femur/knee xrays - There is a mid shaft femoral fracture
with mild varus angulation of the distal fragment relative to
the proximal. There is also medial subluxation by ~ 1 cortical
width.

[**9-2**]
MRI cspine - Edema in the interspinous ligaments from C3-C4
through C7-T1, without evidence of distraction. lobal central
canal narrowing due to congenital short pedicles. This is
slightly exacerbated by a disc bulge at C3-4. No cord signal
abnormality. Moderate right C4-5 neural foramen narrowing due to
uncovertebral osteophytes.

[**9-3**]
Bilateral LE LENIs - No deep venous thrombosis involving the
right or left lower extremity.
LUE LENI -  No deep venous thrombosis in the left upper
extremity.

[**9-7**]
CT Abdomen/Pelvis - Right pleural effusion with associated
compressive atelectasis. Considerable improvement in the
appearance of the right lobe of the liver laceration. Small
amount of free fluid in the pelvis. Fractures of the left first
and right fourth and fifth ribs. Fracture of
the right transverse process of T1.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the trauma ICU.

[**8-29**] - Patient was admittd to the ICU. He was taken to the
operation room with ortho for ORIF of his right femur (see
operative report for full details).  Neurosurgery was consulted
and an ICP was placed.  He was started on dilantin and q1 hour
neurochecks.

[**Date range (1) 58392**] - The patient was transfused 4u PRBC for a decreasing
Hct.  He had a right femur hematoma which was expanding but his
limb was soft and there was no fear of compartment symdrome.
His Hct stabilized. Head CT was stable.

[**9-1**] - His ICP was discontinued and neurosurgery signed off.
Head CT was stable.

[**9-2**] - MR of head and c-spine were performed.

[**9-3**] - Bilateral LE and LUE LENIs were performed which
demonstrated no DVT.

[**9-4**] - The patient went the OR with the acute care service for
tracheostomy and IVC filter placement.

[**9-6**] - Patient dc'ed his dophoff tube twice.

[**9-7**] - A CT A/P was done because of persistent fevers and rising
white count.  No source for his fevers was identified.  Patient
was put to trach collar.

[**9-8**]: Awake, off-versed, following commands. Passed S&S for
regular diet and Passy [**Last Name (un) 87596**] Valve. BAL cultures grew MRSA, kept
only on Vanc now. Patient ready to be transferred to floor,
waiting for a bed. `

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he continued to make
slow progress.  His trach tube was plugged with a PMV and he
tolerated it well.  After confirming no aspiration by video
swallow he was tolerating a regular diet with thin liquids.

The Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy services followed
him on a daily basis to increase his mobility and increase
cognitive abilities.  His memory is decreased and he
occasionally has some confusion but is improving each day.

He has a PICC line placed on [**2177-9-12**] for IV antibiotics and will
require Vancomycin thru [**2177-9-16**] for MRSA pneumonia.  He has
minimal secretions but is undergoing nebulizer treatments.

Potentially his IVC filter can be removed but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will re
evaluate in a few weeks therefore he will need to return to the
[**Hospital 2536**] Clinic. He will also follow up in the Neuro cognitive clinic
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] following his discharge from rehab.

After a lonfg hospitalization he was transferred to rehab on
[**2177-9-12**] for further therapy with the goal to return home soon.
