Chief Complaint:
Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2167-9-16**] Central venous line placement
[**2167-9-17**] Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 69 yo F with history of breast cancer and
secondary AML s/p induction therapy with 7+3 (multiple
complications) and subsequent dacogen therapy with continued
peripheral blasts throughout treatment who presents for
admission for more aggressive treatment for secondary AML (had
been deferred until after her son's wedding, which happened this
past weekend).
.
She was seen in onc clinic on [**9-14**] and reported fatigue that
began on Friday after receiving plts.  She reports feelings
slightly better on Saturday (2 days PTA), but again felt
fatigued on Sunday and developed blisters on her lips and mouth
with bleeding.  She also endorse very mild sore throat beginning
2 days PTA.  She denies fevers and chills at home.  She further
denied any SOB (PTA), cough, abdominal pain, N/V/diarrhea,
dysuria, or rashes.  She has had no recent travel, sick
contacts, or recent dental procedures.  Blood cultures were
drawn in clinic and she received a bag of platelets prior to
direct admission to the floor from clinic for treatment of her
AML.
.
She was febrile on presentation so cefepime was started for
neutropenic fever.  CXR on admission demonstrated several
bilateral lung opacities, mostly in a perihilar distribution and
CT chest was recommended.  Overnight last night, she developed
worsening hypoxia requiring 3L NC supplemental O2 (had
previously been on RA) and tachypnea although she reports her
breathing felt comfortable.  CT chest was performed which showed
diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities concerning for
infection vs. pulmonary edema vs. pulmonary hemorrhage.
Vancomycin was started in addition to cefepime and ID and
pulmonary consults were obtained.  Blood cultures from [**9-14**] are
growing enterococcus.  Nasopharyngeal aspirate negative for
influenza, parainfluenza, adeno, and RSV.  Based on the
appearance of her chest CT, ID and pulm agreed on bronch planned
for [**9-17**].  ID recommended adding azithromycin for possible
atypical pulmonary infection as well as treating for PCP given
appearance on imaging, neutropenia, and acute elevation of her
LDH so she was started on bactrim and prednisone prior to ICU
transfer.  CVL was placed by IR on [**9-16**].
.
In the evening of her transfer, she became increasingly
tachycardic to the 120s (sinus) with RR as high as the 40s with
crackles extending up entire bilateral lung fields.  ABG
performed on the floor 7.49/21/62 on 3L NC.  She received 20mg
IV lasix and atrovent neb.  She was on NRB and is now being
transferred to the floor for sepsis and worsening respiratory
status in the setting of developing multifocal pulmonary
infiltrate.
.
ROS: negative for HA, vision changes, fevers, chills, nausea,
emesis, hematemesis, abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia,
weight changes. positive as above.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 F w/ secondary AML s/p 7+3 (multiple complications) &
Dacogen, still w/ peripheral blasts presented with
enterococcemia. Hospital course complicated by diffuse aveleor
hemorrhage, VRE bacteremia from tunneled catheter line, C.-Diff
colitis and supra-ventricular tachycardia. Patient started on
Azacitadine 75mg/m2 for 7 days, and Gemtuzumab 3mg/m2 on Day 8
for AML therapy (Day 1 [**2167-9-24**]). Unfortunately, repeat bone
marrow showed no response (90% blasts). Patient at this time was
complaining of increasing dyspnea, demonstrated fluid overload
on exam and ECHO demonstrated a significantly decreased EF
25-30%. Patient was suffering from Stage 4 CHF. Patient and
family decided not to pursue additional chemotherapy treatments.
Over the course of the next week patient became unresponsive and
was unable to eat or swallow pills. Family decided on comfort
care measures. Social work, chaplain service, and medical staff
offered support. Patient passed on [**2167-10-25**].
