History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo f w/ h/o herpes zoster, AF, COPD, and HTN admitted on
[**2186-10-30**] w/ ongoing pain surrounding a rash on her buttocks x 2
weeks as well as constipation. Patient was recently admitted one
week ago to Geriatrics for herpes zoster outbreak on her
buttocks that she noticed one week prior to admission. Treated c
acyclovir and PO steroids. Lesions improved and crusted over c
pt discharged four days ago on tylenol for pain control. Since
discharge pt c/o ongoing deep burning pain surrounding her L
buttock. Her daughters note the lesions have not changed since
discharge.

On day of transfer to ICU, nurse called for c/o abdominal pain
and mild wheezing. Of note, patient had been drinking golytely
to aid w/ bowel movement. On nurse's arrival, patient cyanotic,
gasping for air, and then became unresponsive. A code was
called. On arrival, patient awake, palpable pulse, but sats 88%
on 100% NRB. Anesthesia present and patient was intubated.
During intubation, patient had large amount of vomitus and was
aggressively suctioned. SBP still 112. Following bolus of
propofol for sedation, bp dropped to SBP 80. Groin line
attempted but unsuccessful. Patient transported to ICU. BP
improved to SBP 160 w/o major intervention. Approximately 1 L NS
had been infused. EKG post code was w/o evidence of ischemia.
Labs were remarkable for lactate 2.1, sodium 121, creatinine
1.7, wbc 17.6, and troponin 0.03.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **]YO F c h/o AF, HTN, hypothyroidism admitted to hospital
for pain associated with zoster and constipation, now
transferred to MICU for respiratory failure likely secondary to
aspiration event. The patient was intubated on admission to the
MICU for probable aspiration pneumonia and started on cefepime
and Flagyl (Flagyl given additional concerns for C. Diff). The
patient was extubated on [**2186-11-5**] and appeared to be doing well
overnight. However, over the course of the next 24 hours the
patient was noted to become increasingly tachypnic, with diffuse
course wheezing and increasing hypoxia. The patient was treated
aggressively for her COPD by increasing nebulizer treatments to
standing nebs and she was started on high dose IV steroids.
During this episode, the patient was additionally found to be
hypertensive and increasingly tachycardic, with busrts of afib.
The patient's BP was agressively treated as well. Despite this,
the following day the patient was found to be still increasingly
tachypnic and hypoxic. Repeat chest film appeared to show new
lingular and bibasilar infiltrates with possible pulmonary
congestion. The patient was treated aggressively for CHF as well
by controlling the patient's afterload with increased dose of
losartan 100mg po qd, a nitroglycerin drip, and eventually a
diltiazem drip as well. Despite these efforts, the patient
developed increasing respiratory distress, requiring repeat
elective intubation with concern for impending respiratory
failure. Upon reintubation the patient was found to have
relatively rapid resolution of her tachyardia and hypertension.
Over the course of a couple days the patient was treated
aggressively for the underlying problems that likely
necessiatated reintubation. The patients afib with RVR was
controlled with rate control initially with a diltiazem drip
that was eventually converted to po dosing 90mg po qd. The
patient's hypertension was treated with losartan,increased to
100mg po qd, with serial addition of a nitroglycerin drip and
hydralazine 25 mg po q6hr. Underlying COPD was controlled
aggressively with steroids, cefepime for COPD and questionable
pneuomonia and nebulizer treatments. The patient was weaned to
minimal pressure support and was extubated after testing
revealed a RSBI of 45. The patient was extubated with the
addition of low dose haldol and ativan for associated anxiety
that likely contributed to tachpynea and respiratory distress on
previous extubation. The patient was extubated uneventfully and
subsequent blood gases revealed she was not markedly hypercarbic
although with still some hypoxia for which she continued to
receive supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula. Given her rising
creatinine, the patient's losartan was discontinued and her
blood pressure control was optimized with preload and afterload
reduction with isosorbide mononitrite and hydralazine
respectively. The patient's heart rate and BP were found to be
adequately controlled with this regimen and she was breathing
comfortably. Of note, despite this improvement, given the
patient's tenuous respiratory status and possibility for repeat
intubation indefiniteley, converation with patient's family
resulted in decision to make patient's code status DNR/DNI. Upon
transfer to the floor pt with ongoing respiratory distress. This
was unable to be controlled through aggressive diuresis. The
pt's Cr bumped in the setting of diuresis. She was placed on a
shovel mask, as she would not tolerate a face mask. Pt's WBC
rose again and she was found to have a UTI. She was started on
levofloxacin for this. The family and pt elected for comfort
care only. They did not want additional medications given. The
pt's respi status continued to worsen and on [**2186-11-16**] she
expired.
.
#. HTN: The patient has an outpatient regimen of isosorbide
mononitrate 10mg po bid, losartan 50mg po qd, amlodipine 10mg po
qd, Dyazide. The patient's pressures were noted to be poorly
controlled in the ICU. Initially, given concern for hypotension
with acute exacerbation the patient's losartan was cut in half
and dyazide held. The patient's full dose losartan was restarted
with the addition of 5mg po qd amlodipine, the losartan was then
titrated to 100mg po qd. As the patient remained hypertensive,
and in the setting of respiratory distress and afib, the patient
was serially placed on a nitroglycerin drip and then a diltiazem
drip as well for blood pressure control as well as rate control
of Afib with RVR. As above, the patient is currently receiving
adequate control with diltiazem, isosorbide mononitrite and
hydralazine and is additionally receiving low doses of lasix
with goal of gentle diuresis with attention towards her rising
creatinine. Her BP regimen was continued as above, while her
diuresis was limited [**2-15**] her rising creatinine.
.
#. PAF: On admission to the ICU the patient was in sinus
rhythym. With the advent of increasing resp distress and
uncontrolled hypertension, as described above, the patient was
eventually placed on a diltiazem dr
