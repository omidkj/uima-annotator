STUDIES:
CXR [**2163-4-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Asymmetric pulmonary opacities, right greater than left,
likely asymmetric pulmonary edema. A superimposed aspiration/
infection is not excluded in the right base.
2. ET tube in optimal position.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Probably preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.
Right ventricle not well visualized. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are not well seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: VERY Suboptimal image quality. Preserved globall
left ventricular systolic function. Valvular structures not well
visualized. Right ventricle not well visuarlized. Cannot assess
diastolic function or pulmonary artery pressures.

[**2163-4-24**] Portable Chest X-Ray:
FINDINGS: Tracheostomy tube tip terminates about 4 cm above the
carina.
Other indwelling devices are unchanged in position. Widening of
cardiomediastinal contours is similar allowing for patient
rotation.
Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by mild
interstitial edema and a small right pleural effusion tracking
into the minor fissure.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 49 yo F with a presumed history of asthma, morbid
obesity who presents with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Pt
was intubated in the ED, and was a difficult intubation
requiring 4 attempts. Pt was admitted to the MICU and initially
started on broad spectrum abx, but this was tailored to
CTX/Azithromycin for CAP. Pt was continued on standing albuterol
& atrovent MDI's while intubated. Cultures were sent and there
was no growth. Respiratory viral screen was negative. Pt was
diuresed. TTE was a poor quality study. MICU course was
complicated by agitation, requiring propofol. However, given
elevated TG's, this was discontiued. She was started on Seroquel
for agitation in addition to home Zoloft. MICU course was also
complicated by acute renal failure of pre-renal etiology likely
[**1-19**] to aggressive diuresis.
