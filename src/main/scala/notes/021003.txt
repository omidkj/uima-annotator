Allergies:
Lipitor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Permanent pacemaker placement
R Femoral line placement, now removed
Right internal jugular Cordis and transvenous pacemaker
placement, now removed


History of Present Illness:
78 y/o female with PMH of persistent atrial
fibrillation/flutter, chronic diastolic heart failure (EF 65%),
DM2, hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents from home with
bradycardia and AMS. History obtained from family and per chart
given patient currently intubated. Per patient's son she
developed chest pain at 2am on morning of [**1-22**]. The patient was
moaning in pain and also complaining of SOB. Her pain continued
through the night and the patient's son called EMS. On arrival
the patient was found to be breadycardic with HR in 20s.
Responsive to verbal stimuli but moaning, BP 80/p. She was given
0.5 atropine without response and then externally paced at 60
with good capture and brought to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, the patient was noted to be bradycardic with HR in
20s, BP was unobtainable while externally paced at 60s. Right
femoral line was inserted urgently (non-sterile) and dopamine
was started with BP 131/60. Cordis and TVP was inserted, now
paced at 75. Intubated for airway protection, received fentanyl
50mcg and versed 2mg for sedation. Got 4 amps of calcium
gluconate. A-line inserted. Also received vanc and zosyn IV and
1L IVF. Admitted to CCU.
.
Of note the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] service from
[**Date range (1) 16653**] for afib with RVR and fluid overload. During the
admission her HR was difficult to control. She was started on
diltiazem and continued on BB. The doses required to achieve
adequate heart rate control then caused the patient to became
bradycardic. Her metoprolol was discontinued and she was started
on amiodarone with the plan to undergo cardioversion in the next
few weeks. She was diuresed with IV lasix and then started on
spironolactone and lisinopril was increased. She was discharged
with KOH monitor. On [**1-21**] monitor showed afib with slow VR (40-50
bpm) with pauses up to 2.4 seconds. The patient was asked to
stop amiodarone and diltiazem, however per the patient's
daughter this was not communicated to her and the patient
continued to take these meds. She was asymptomatic at the time.

.
ROS unobtainable given patient is intubated and sedated.
Currently the patient is awake, responsive to verbal stimuli.
Moving all extremities, denies pain.

BLOOD CULTURES [**2154-1-23**]: pending x 2

.
IMAGING:
ECHO [**2154-1-23**]
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2154-1-23**]
IMPRESSION:
Cardiomegaly with clear lungs and blunting of the right
costophrenic angle
which may represent a residual pleural effusion versus scarring.

ET tube terminating 6 cm above the carina with apparent
overinflation of the
ET cuff tube. Clinical correlation is recommended.
.
CXR [**2154-1-23**]
IMPRESSION: Slight increase in left retrocardiac opacity, likely
atelectatic.
Note that the side port of the nasogastric tube is near the
level of the GE
junction and this tube should be advanced.
.
CXR [**2154-1-24**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval removal of endotracheal tube and right IJ line. A
left-sided
pacemaker and wires are in unchanged position.
2. Improvement in left basilar opacity suggesting resolving
atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 78 y/o female with PMH of persistent atrial
fibrillation/flutter, chronic diastolic heart failure (EF 65%),
DM2, hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents from home with
chest pain, bradycardia and AMS, now intubated with TVP.
.
# CORONARIES:  No documented history of CAD.  No prior c. cath.
Given history of chest pain prior to presentaion this is
concerning for cardiac ischemia.  Unfortunately do not have
tracings of native rhythm to look for ischemic changes and pt.
now paced.  CE x 3 were negative.
.
# PUMP:  Has a history of diastolic heart failure. Did not have
objective signs of overload.  Portable TTE showed mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
was no pericardial effusion. Diuretics and ACEI were initially
held in the setting of ARF and hypotension. Lasic, BB, and ACEI
were eventually resumed during stay.
.
# RHYTHM: Patient has long history of afib/flutter on coumadin.
Failed ablation in the past.  Had recent admission for afib with
RVR which was difficult to control with nodal agents due to
induced bradycardia.  Etiology includes tachy-brady (most likely
given history) vs ischemia vs. hyperkalemia, among others.  Was
on amio and dilt as outpatient, asked to stop on [**1-21**] given
bradycardia however this was not done.  HR in 20s on
presentation requiring external and then TVP.  Currently stable
with temp pacing.  Bradycardia may be secondary to amio and CCB
vs. cardiac ischemia.  Threshold tested on arrival to CCU and
found to be <1. EP was consulted and permanent pacemaker was
placed without incident. She
