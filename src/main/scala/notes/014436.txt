Pertinent Results
[**2168-11-11**]: BK Virus, QN PCR     No DNA Detected
[**2168-11-16**]: HEPARIN DEPENDENT ANTIBODIES        EQUIVOCAL

EKGs:
[**2168-11-12**]: Baseline artifact. Sinus bradycardia. Q-T interval
prolongation. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous
tracing there is no significant change.Clinical correlation is
suggested.
Imaging:
CXR [**2168-11-12**]: IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.

CXR [**2168-11-13**]: Moderate cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary
vascular
engorgement and worsening perihilar and basilar pulmonary edema,
now moderate in severity. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural
effusions are present, with worsening on the right in the
interval.

CXR [**2168-11-13**]: Interval placement of endotracheal tube, with tip
terminating about 6.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube
courses below the diaphragm with tip outside of the field of
view. Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.
Perihilar and basilar edema have slightly improved, and are
accompanied by bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the
right and small-to-moderate on the left.

TTE [**2168-11-14**]: he left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
systolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertention. Right
ventricular cavity enlargement with preserved free wall motion.
At least mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-8-22**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure and the right
ventricular cavity size are increased. The severity of mitral
regurgitation is likely similar. If clinically indicated, a TEE
would be better able to assess the severity of mitral
regurgitation.

[**2168-11-15**]: TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen
in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body
of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial
appendage ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s). Left atrial
appendage Doppler pattern is most consistent with atrial
flutter. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are complex (>4mm, non-mobile) atheroma in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mildly thickened mitral leaflets with moderate
mitral regurgitation. Complex, non-mobile, thoracic aortic
atheroma. No thrombus, but atrial flutter functional pattern of
the left a
