Admission Date:  [**2190-12-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2191-1-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2113-10-6**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old female
with diabetes mellitus times thirteen years, history of
gastrointestinal bleed, seen by outpatient cardiologist
[**2190-12-15**], for preoperative clearance for cataract surgery.
In the office, the patient complained of substernal chest
pain radiating to the left arm with nausea over the past day.
Electrocardiogram showed a 2.0 to 3.[**Street Address(2) 52938**] elevation, right-sided leads consistent with right
ventricular infarct.  Troponin 13.5.  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for catheterization on
Heparin drip, Integrilin, Plavix and Aspirin.  Cardiac
catheterization revealed 100% proximal occlusion of the
distal collateral filling, status post successful Hepacoat
stents times two.  The procedure was complicated by sinus
node dysfunction exacerbated by transient no reflow.  The
patient was transferred to the CCU for control with AV pacing
wires on Dopamine.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Amitriptyline.
2.  Multivitamin.
3.  Eye drops.
4.  Humulin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus times thirteen years.
2.  History of upper gastrointestinal bleed.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with husband.  [**Name (NI) 482**]
Hindi.  The patient denies alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No family history of myocardial infarction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, temperature is 98.8,
heart rate 98, blood pressure 90 to 110 over 50 to 60.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat - Extraocular movements are
intact.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation. Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck
revealed no jugular venous distention.  Respiratory -
intubated.  Clear breath sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, II/VI
holosystolic murmur.  Extremities showed 2+ dorsalis pedis
bilaterally, warm, no edema.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram precatheterization showed
sinus at 75 beats per minute, normal axis, early R wave
progression, inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction, 2.0
to 3.0 millimeters, small Q wave, aVL less than 1.0
millimeter, ST depressions V5 and V6 with less than 1.[**Street Address(2) 52939**] elevations consistent with prior study.

Echocardiogram on [**2190-12-15**], showed symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, unusually small left ventricular cavity, mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, resting
regional wall motion abnormalities including inferolateral
akinesis and hypokinesis.  The right ventricular cavity is
dilated.  Right ventricular systolic function was depressed.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened, mild 1+
aortic regurgitation, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation, 2+
tricuspid regurgitation.

Cardiac catheterization on [**2190-12-15**], showed left anterior
descending 40 to 50% of the mid posterior diagonal, left
circumflex 80% at the mid large obtuse marginal, right
coronary artery 100% proximally with distal collaterals.
Left ventriculogram showed ejection fraction of 40%, severe
right ventricular hypokinesis.

Creatinine 1.1, hematocrit 37.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Coronary artery disease - The patient had initial cardiac
catheterization and stents placed to the right coronary
artery as described above.  She had two right coronary artery
stents placed and at the time of catheterization had
temporary AV pacing wires placed.  She was intubated at the
time.  Her catheterization was complicated by bouts of
bradycardia and hypotension with initial balloon dilation
requiring Atropine, Dopamine and right ventricular pacing.
Coronary sinus pacing wire was placed with continuous
Dopamine drip for augmentation of blood pressure.  During her
CCU course she ultimately regained intrinsic pacing function
and her pacing wires were discontinued.  She was started on
an Aspirin, Plavix, statin, ace inhibitor and beta blocker.

Pump function - Echocardiogram as described above.
Initially, the patient had severe right ventricular
dysfunction, however, she regained much of her function in
her right ventricle and subsequent echocardiogram on
[**2190-12-27**], showed a mildly dilated left atrium, left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and systolic function
are normal with an ejection fraction of 55%.  The right
ventricular cavity was mildly dilated.  Right ventricular
systolic function depressed.  Mild 1+ aortic regurgitation,
moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation, and compared to the
findings of the prior report, the inferior wall motion
abnormality had resolved.

Rhythm - The patient temporarily required AV pacing, however,
her sinus function was regained and she has maintained a
normal sinus rhythm during her hospitalization.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient was intubated in the
catheterization laboratory for agitation and initially failed
extubation secondary to increased granulation tissue around
the intubation tubing.  On [**2190-12-28**], she failed a second
extubation secondary to the airway edema.  On [**2190-12-29**], an
open tracheostomy was performed by the ENT service in the
operating room.  Since that time, she has been progressively
changed to smaller and smaller tracheostomy tubes and at the
time of this dictation, the expectation is that she will not
need a tracheostomy for long term care and that she will
regain regular upper airway pulmonary function.  However, in
the meantime, she will need rehabilitation services.

3.  Gastroenterology - The patient had a history of upper
gastrointestinal bleed and, while intubated, she was
maintained on tube feedings.  After extubation and
tracheostomy placement, the patient failed a speech and
swallow test on two separate occasions.  A percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed on [**2191-1-4**], for
feeding purposes until the time when she is able to swallow
on her own.

4.  Infectious disease - The patient had a period of time
during her hospitalization where she had fevers of unknown
etiology.  She completed a course of Vancomycin, Levaquin and
Flagyl for suspected aspiration pneumonia.  At the time of
this dictation, all cultures have not grown anything to date.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation facility with follow-up
with cardiology.  Her primary cardiologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1159**] at
[**Hospital3 1280**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Metoprolol 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Insulin sliding scale.
3.  NPH 28 units twice a day.
4.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Atrovent MDI two puffs q6hours p.r.n.
6.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
7.  Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. twice a day.
8.  Senna 1 mg p.o. once daily.
9.  Heparin subcutaneous 5000 units twice a day.
10. Lipitor 20 mg p.o. once daily.
11. Plavix 75 mg p.o. once daily.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1159**] in
cardiology clinic within the next month.
