Pertinent Results:
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-9-12**] 11:44 PM
Reason: eval for cervical fx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
86 year old woman on coumadin s/p fall tx with subdural
hematoma.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for cervical fx
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

FINDINGS: Again seen is a non-displaced fracture through the
left occipital bone medially. The mastoid air cells and
visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. There is no evidence of
fracture or dislocation involving the cervical spine. There are
moderate degenerative changes at C3 through C6 with severe joint
space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and cystic subchondral
degenerative changes. There is a broad-based calcified disc
bulging into the thecal sac at C6-7. Additionally, there is
ossification of the ALL at this level. Multilevel facet
hypertrophy is noted, with mild narrowing of the right-sided
neural foramina at C2-3. There is mild-to-moderate centrilobular
emphysema at the lung apices.

IMPRESSION:
1. No definite evidence of fracture or dislocation involving the
cervical spine.

2. Non-displaced left occipital bone fracture.

3. Moderate degenerative changes of the cervical spine as noted
above.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-9-12**] 11:43 PM

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
86 year old woman on coumadin s/p fall tx with subdural
hematoma.
COMPARISON: Outside hospital CT, available in the ED workroom.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been dramatic increase to the
bifrontal subarachnoid hemorrhage since the outside hospital CT
from four hours prior. Additionally, there is a 1.5 x 1.4 cm
area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe
inferiorly as well as probable left subdural hemorrhage
measuring 1 cm in diameter along the left frontal convexity. The
subdural hemorrhage has moderate mass effect on the subjacent
cortex. There is no midline shift, hydrocephalus, or herniation.

Evidence of an old right parietal stroke with encephalomalacia
and punctate calcification likely from prior hemorrhage is
noted. There are no new areas of major vascular territorial
infarct. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
are clear.

IMPRESSION:

1. Dramatic increase in bifrontal subarachnoid hemorrhage with
new areas of right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and left
frontal subdural hemorrhage. Comparison was made to outside
hospital CT from four hours prior, which is currently with the
Neurology team.

2. Old right parietal infarct.

Findings were discussed with neurology at the time of the exam.

NOTES ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a midline fracture of
the occipital bone that extends superiorly to cross the
confluence of sinuses. this raises the possibility of sinus
injury. There are bifrontal hemorrhagic contusions. The outside
head CT is not available for comparison.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-9-13**] 1:51 PM

COMPARISON: Non-contrast CT head performed [**2162-9-12**]
demonstrating "midline fracture of the occipital bone extending
superiorly across the confluence of the sinuses raising
possibility of sinus injury. There are bilateral hemorrhagic
contusions.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is an obliquely oriented
nondisplaced occipital bone fracture extending from the
mid-occiput to the foramen magnum on the left. There is soft
tissue edema overlying the occiput.

There is slightly increased bifrontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage and mass effect since prior study, with the
hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe measuring 1.9 x 1.7 cm. A
left superior subdural hemorrhage measuring 1 cm from the left
frontal convexity is noted, unchanged. The subdural hemorrhage
has moderate mass effect on the adjacent cortex, unchanged.
There is no evidence of subfalcine herniation, hydrocephalus or
herniation.

Stable appearance of chronic right parietal infarct with
encephalomalacia and punctate calcifications is apaprent. There
are no new areas of vascular or territorial infarct.

IMPRESSION:
1. There is a obliquely oriented occipital bone fracture
extending from the mid occipital bone to the foramen magnum,
with subcutaneous edema, consitent with coup injury.

2. The frontal intraparenchymal injury likely represents a
countercoup injury and with intraparenchymal bleeding that is
slightly increased, compared with prior study.

3. There is stable subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage as noted
above.

4. Stable chronic infarcts as noted above.

[**2162-9-14**] - ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 16-20 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular volume overload. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to increased
stroke volume due to aortic regurgitation. Mild to moderate
([**11-17**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted to Neurosurgery ICU on [**2162-9-13**] for
treatment of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage s/p fall. She was
on coumadin for Afib s/p pacemaker prior to admission, which was
on hold and her INR was reversed. Repeat head CT on HD#
