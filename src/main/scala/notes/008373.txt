Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
found down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Diagnostic paracentesis.
Therapeutic paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
49M w/ polysubstance abuse, HCV, HBV, AIDS, autonomic
dysfunction, and cirrhosis admitted after being found down at
the T stop. At the scene he was felt to have falled down the
stairs and was brought to the ED. Here he was hypothermic with
an elevated lactate and SPB ~70 and started on vancomycin/zosyn
for presumed sepsis. Diagnostic tap of his ascites was negative.
CT showed a small SAH (later thought to be artifact on repeat)
and he was dilantin/keppra loaded. A L1/2 compression fx was
seen and orthopedics evaluated him as well. His initial labs
were significant for a coagulopathy w/ INR=1.8 and plt=53 and he
was given 1u plt, 2u RBC, and 1u FFP and sent to the MICU for
further w/u. Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**5-31**]
for progressive ascites and had a therapeutic tap there and was
diuresed with lasix/aldactone.
.
In the MICU, his BP was stable in a normal range and he had a
CXR showing a probable infiltrate along w/ ? R rib fractures and
his antibiotics were switched to levaquin/flagyl. His mental
status was slightly impaired on arrival (AAOx2) and this was
felt to be secondary to intoxication and chronic liver failure.
His labs were initially thought to be c/w a picture of DIC (low
haptoglobin, low plt, low fibrinogen) but his OSH labs were
eventually obtained and showed a chronic picture of liver
failure (alt 71, ast 130, alp 719, tbili 1.2, alb 2.1, INR 1.6)
along w/ pancytopenia (HCT 24.8 and plt 53). Given this
information, his hematologic abnormalities were thought to be
close to his baseline and he was called out to the floor.

[**7-27**] MRI C-Spine Findings: Alignment of the cervical spine is
normal. There are degenerative changes with intervertebral
osteophyte formation at C4-5. This causes severe narrowing of
the spinal canal and flattening of the spinal cord.
Uncovertebral osteophytes narrow the neural foramina bilaterally
at this level. The involvement is more severe on the right and
left.
Small osteophytes at C5-6 narrow the spinal canal and produce
mild narrowing of the neural foramina. The signal intensity of
the spinal cord appears normal.

[**7-27**] Rib X-Ray Nondisplaced fractures of the right posterolateral
eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs with callous formation. The
findings represent subacute versus remote injury. No
pneumothorax.

Interval worsening of bilateral airspace opacities, worse in the
left mid lung. Diagnostic considerations include pneumonia

CT head [**2151-7-25**]:
Likely a small focus of subarachnoid blood in the left parietal

occipital lobe. Scalp hematoma of the left scalp. No evidence
for skull fracture.
.
CT spine [**2151-7-25**]:
No evidence for cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
Degenerative changes at C4-5
.
CT abd/pelvis:
1. Large volume of ascites throughout the abdomen and pelvis.
Small liver and few small varices suggest liver disease.
2. Distended gallbladder without gallbladder wall thickening or
gallstones.
3. Distended stomach containing solid and liquid material.
4. Pancreatic calcifications suggest prior pancreatitis. No
pancreatic inflammation or peripancreatic fluid collections.
5. Anasarca.
6. Probe/instrument within the rectum.
7. Compression deformity of L1 vertebral body of indeterminate
age.
.
CXR ([**2151-8-3**]): 1. Stable multifocal consolidations, most
consistent with pneumonia. 2. Stable appearance of right-sided
rib fractures without evidence for pneumothorax.

KUB ([**2151-8-3**]): 1) Mild gaseous distention to loops of small
bowel, with probable large bowel ileus affecting transverse
colon. 2) Re-identification of known ascites.

KUB ([**2151-8-4**]): Slightly decreased distention to loops of small
bowel with unchanged dilatation of the transverse colon
measuring up to 8 cm suggestive of an ileus. No evidence of
obstruction.

KUB ([**2151-8-5**]):Dilated transverse colon with interval development
of a single loop of dilated small bowel within the left lower
quadrant. These findings are again most suggestive of an ileus.
Continued radiographic surveillance is recommended.
