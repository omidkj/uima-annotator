Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
 69 yo M w/ locally advanced esophageal ca, copd with baseline
02 req., sever emphysema, htn. Initially presented on [**2133-1-4**]
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with SOB, productive cough, DOE and chest pain a [**3-1**]
days. In the ED: initial vitals were 98.3, 107/65, 109, 30, 96%
on 3L. He was given ASA 325mg, atrovent neb, prednisone 40mg x1.
A bedside echo showed a new pericardial effusion. A CTA showed
no PE but was significant for a small-mod pericardial effusion
as well as some pericardial enhancement, small right-sided
pleural effusion, increased mediastinal lymphadenopathy (?mets
vs. CHF). CE were negative. He was initially admitted to the
medical floor. Now he is being transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
respiratory distress. This morning, the patient was triggered
for hypoxia (desaturation to72% on 3L NC) and tachypnea. His 02
sats improved to 95% on NRB. He was given 125mg solumedrol IV
with improvement of RR.  He was given 20IV lasix, and a foley
was placed. He was then transitioned to a humidified face mask
at 70% 02. His initial ABG is 7.46/41/77, lactatea 1.6. After
foley placement he immediately put out 525ml of UOP. He was
given another 10 IV lasix and 1mg morphine IV.
Of note: hospitalized in [**10-3**] for SOB, complete collapse of LLL,
a pleural catheter was placed and almost completely drained the
left-sided effusion, cytology and micro were negative. The
catheter was removed. There was only slight re-expansion of the
LLL.

[**1-12**] VIDEO SWALLOW
.
VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOWING EVALUATION: The oral
phase was normal. The pharyngeal phase was notable for delayed
initiation of swallowing; however, there is normal hyoid
excursion and laryngeal elevation after initiation of the
swallow. No penetration or aspiration was seen. Limited
fluoroscopic images of the thorax show the gastric pull through.
Of note, the patient complained of fullness after swallowing,
however, no mass lesion was identified.

Limited fluoroscopic images also demonstrate degenerative
changes in the cervical spine.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of penetration or aspiration on
swallowing. For full details, please see the report by speech
and [**Hospital3 25040**] services of the same day.
.
ECHO [**2133-1-9**]
.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a small pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: A very small pericardial effusion, without signs of
tamponade.
.
[**2133-1-4**] CTA CHEST
.
CTA CHEST: There is normal filling of the pulmonary arterial
vasculature without evidence of pulmonary embolism. There is
interval increase in the size of the pericardial effusion, now
small to moderate. Subtle pericardial enhancement is noted. The
patient is status post gastric pull-up for esophageal cancer.
There is mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which appears to have
increased in the short interval since [**2132-12-31**]. This is
concerning for either infection or may be caused by CHF. Again
noted is severe centrilobular emphysema bilaterally with
predominance in the upper lobes. There is stable left lower lobe
atelectasis and effusion. There is a new small right-sided
pleural effusion with associated mild compressive atelectasis.
In addition, there is worsening of bilateral basilar
atelectasis. No axillary lymphadenopathy.

Non-contrast images through the upper abdomen do not demonstrate
acute pathology. The patient is status post cholecystectomy.

BONE WINDOWS: No evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Increased pericardial effusion, now small to moderate. Note
is also made of subtle pericardial enhancement - in conjunction
with the FDG avidity of the pericard on the recent PET-CT this
raises the possibility of pericarditis. D/w Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
on [**2133-1-4**].
2. New small right-sided pleural effusion.
3. Increased bilateral basilar atelectasis.
4. Increased mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the short interval
since [**2132-12-31**]. While the lymphadenopathy per se is
concerning for metastatic disease, the rapid interval change is
more likely due to congestive heart failure or may due to
infection.
6. No evidence of PE.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo M w/ esophageal CA s/p resection, copd, emphysema, htn,
dysphagia w/ [**Hospital 12353**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name **] to hypoxia,  tachypnea.
.
# hypoxia: Pt. exp. acute desat to 72% on 3L NC. His CXR was
suggestive of worsening pleural effusion. He was given
solumedrol 125mg IV. He resp. status improved w/ 30 IV lasix
(good UOP) and 1mg IV morphine. Differential for hypoxia is CHF,
pulmonary edema, tamponade, pna, copd exacerbation, PE (although
neg CTA 2 days ago), pneumothorax. The patient was breathig
comfortably on 40% facemask by the time he was transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  he remained on facemask overnight and did not develop
respiratory distress or hemodynamic instability.  CXR on [**1-7**]
showing less fluid overload s/p lasix compared to [**1-6**].
Pericardial effusion thought not to be contributing to resp
compromise.  he was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics for
possible pneumonia. His steroids were tapered after patient was
stabilized. hE FINISHED VANCOMYCIN COURSE ON [**12-27**]
