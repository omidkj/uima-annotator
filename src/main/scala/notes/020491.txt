History of Present Illness:
 86 y/o male with a past medical history significant for
metastatic large B-cell lymphoma (last cycle R-CVP [**2196-10-5**]),
atrial fibrillation, and mechanical mitral valve whose children
called oncology clinic to convert his [**Month/Day/Year 1988**] chemotherapy
appointment into an urgent visit because they reported that
their father looked [**Name2 (NI) **]. On evaluation, 96.6-80/60-85-20-99% on
2L O2 via NC and needed help transfering from bed to chair

and congestive heart failure. He was transferred to the
Emergency Department.
.
On arrival to the Emergency Department T 95, BP 124/68, HR 82,
O2 sat 95% on 2LNC. In ED, patient developed Afib w/ RVR
(maximum rate appears to be 119 per charting records) with blood
pressure of 84/49 -> 99/46 w/ 500 NS bolus.  Also given 0.5
digoxin IV ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Cardiologist). Within one hour his
HR was around 100 with BP of 120s-130s/70s-90s. He received a
CXR which was read as LLL PNA and was given levofloxacin 750mg
IV* once.  Also given ASA 325.  He was placed on non-rebreather
for unclear reason and transferred to the MICU.
.
On transfer to the MICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 4610**] was HR 95-105, Systolic BP
105-115, and 100% on NRB but also 96% on RA. He states he was
admitted due to problems with his heart (his atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular rate). Mr. [**Known lastname 4610**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] being ill.  He
states that the last round of chemotherapy left him feeling
weak, with no appetite, diarrhea and swelling in bilateral upper
extremities.  He feels better than when he first went to

ROS: He [**Last Name (Titles) **] any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
(last BM yesterday), blood in stool, chest pain/pressure,
shortness of breath.  He reports a chronic dry non-productive
cough that is unchanged from baseline. The patient states he
does not wear oxygen at baseline, but one night at the
rehabilitation facility it was placed on him. He reports mild
low back pain. He reports he feels thirsty. Otherwise negative
review of systems. At baseline two weeks ago patient walking
with walker and one year ago doing [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor First Name **] and very independent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 86 male with PMHx sig. for DLBCL s/p recent second
cycle of R-CVP, atrial fibrillation, and mechnical mitral valve
on anticoagulation who presented from clinic with fatigue and
hypotension.  In the ED, he developed A. fib with RVR, which
responded well to digoxin.  He was placed on a nonrebreather and
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his hypotension reponded to IVF boluses.  He
remained in sinus rhythm though tachycardic on metoprolol and
digoxin.  There was a question of hypoxia as his pulse oximeter
readings varied with location.  The patient denied any SOB, and
his CXR showed calcified changes unchanged from prior study.  He
was found to have a R arm cellulitis, which was treated with
Keflex.
.
Upon stabilization he was transferred to the Oncology service.
There he developed a hemorrhagic effusion in the setting of
anticoagulation for his mechanical valve.  A chest tube was
placed; however, his respiratory status continued to decline.
On [**2196-11-15**], he developed an episode of hypotension, which
responded to IVF boluses.  However, his respiratory and mental
status acutely declined in response.  His family was called in
and a decision was made to tailor treatment to comfort.  The
patient passed away on [**2196-11-15**].
