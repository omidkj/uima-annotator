CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2193-12-3**] 5:05 PM
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx and pneumomediatinum
INDICATION: Status post rigid bronchoscopy for tumor destruction
- tumor ablation. Evaluate for pneumothorax or
pneumomediastinum.
FINDINGS: AP single view with patient in upright sitting
position has been obtained. There are extensive central
pulmonary infiltrates on the right side, a lesser degree also in
the central portion of the left lung. In addition, multiple
round densities are disseminated in both lungs and suggest the
possibility of secondary metastatic deposits. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum on this single AP
view chest examination. A chest CT was performed earlier during
the same day, but previous chest examinations are not available
so that direct comparison can be performed.
.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2193-12-3**] 12:36 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman with questionable RUL mass with h/o hemoptysis

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval RUL mass
INDICATION: Hemoptysis. Questionable right upper lobe mass.
History of breast cancer.

No prior chest radiographs or chest CT scans are available for
comparison. Comparison is made to CT abdomen of [**2191-3-2**].

Multidetector CT of the chest was performed following
intravenous administration of 65 cc of Optiray. Images were
presented for display in the axial plane at 5 mm and 1.25 mm
collimation.

Numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules are present involving all
lobes of both lungs. These range in size from less than 1 cm to
several cm in diameter. On thin section images, the vast
majority of the nodules have spiculated and lobulated margins.
Though most of the lesions measure less than 3 cm in diameter, a
dominant mass in the lateral segment right middle lobe measures
3.1 cm x 2.4 cm (image 139, series 102). In addition to the
multiple nodules and mass, there are multilobar areas of
ground-glass attenuation within the lungs as well as
geographically marginated areas of consolidation in the
perihilar and paramediastinal portions of the lungs, worse on
the right than the left. Inferiorly, below the level of the
right hilum, the geographically marginated opacities traverse
the fissure in an non-anatomic distribution that is suggestive
of radiation therapy pneumonitis. However, at a higher level,
the opacities are sharply demarcated by the fissure. Additional
findings include smooth septal thickening with diffuse
distribution but most pronounced in the lower lobes and lung
apices, right greater than left. Thickening is present along the
walls of the central airways, particularly the bronchus
intermedius and right upper lobe bronchi posteriorly.

Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is present. Additionally, there
are several prominent right paratracheal lymph nodes measuring
less than 1 cm in greatest short axis dimension, which do not
meet strict criteria for enlargement. The heart size is normal.
A small pericardial effusion is present. Small right pleural
effusion is present as well.

In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, extrarenal pelves
are present bilaterally in the kidneys. Adrenal glands are
stable in appearance compared to the prior CT abdomen study with
no evidence of suspicious lesions to suggest adrenal metastases.
Heterogeneous appearance of the spleen is likely due to phase of
contrast. Please note that the examination was not specifically
tailored for evaluating the abdominal organs.

There has been prior right mastectomy.

Skeletal structures demonstrate several healed right rib
fractures with marked callus formation. Healing or healed lower
left rib fractures are also noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules with spiculated and
lobulated margins. Dominant 3.1 cm mass in right middle lobe
with similar morphology to other lesions. In a patient with
history of breast cancer, this may be due to widespread
metastatic disease. Primary lung cancer with metastatic lesions
and diffuse fungal infection are considered less likely.
2. Extensive areas of consolidation with geographic margins in
the perihilar and paramediastinal portions of both lungs. Some
of these traverse the fissure and could potentially reflect
radiation pneumonitis, but coexisting infection, hemorrhage, or
cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is also possible. Correlation
with the portal would be helpful.
3. Multifocal ground-glass opacities and septal thickening.
Differential diagnosis includes interstitial pulmonary edema,
drug toxicity, pulmonary hemorrhage, and lymphangitic
carcinomatosis.
4. Small pericardial effusion.
5. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and borderline right
paratracheal lymph nodes.
6. If available, direct comparison to prior CT scans would be
helpful to determine change from prior exams.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 58 female with a h/o met breast CA to lung
(RUL), retroperitoneum, and right ureter s/p stent with
recurrent episodes of hemoptysis x 1 week who presented to
[**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital. She was transferred to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1816**]
[**Name (STitle) 1092**] Surgery Service at the [**Hospital1 1170**] from [**Hospital3 7571**]for further assessment of her
hemoptysis on [**2193-12-2**].  She underwent a rigid bronchoscopy on
HD 2 ([**2193-12-3**]) which demonstrated friable mucosa and RUL and
RLL bleeding which was coagulated.  For details of the
operation, please refer to the operative report.  Her
postoperative course has been uncomplicated.
.
On POD 1, she was afebrile and stable.  She has had no episodes
of hemoptysis since admission to the [**Hospital1 827**].  She continued to tolerate a regular diet and
has intermittently had coughing episodes for which she has been
given codeine for.  She was deemed stable for discharge home and
has elected to go home first before deciding on hospice care.
She has been instructed to follow-up with her primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to setup hospice care.  An appointment
scheduled for [**2193-12-5**] at 2:30PM has been made for her with her
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will also be discharged home on her
oxygen as she has been on previously.
