right small pleural effusion. He was started on levaquin. He
also had CTA [**2195-6-25**] for ongoing right sided back and chest
pain, which ruled out pulmonary embolus, but revealed increasing
right
pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis since [**2195-6-24**].
The patient also developed chest congestion, cough and
diaphoresis.

CXR: [**2195-7-1**]: The three right-sided chest tubes are in
unchanged position.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The
right lung base is minimally better ventilated than on the
previous exam. The pre-existing left basal atelectasis shows
unchanged extent, but slightly different distribution.
[**2195-6-29**]: There is interval placement of chest tubes within the
right chest. There are two tips with the tips in the apex and
one at the base. There has been interval decrease in the size of
the right peripheral opacity compatible with adjacent empyema.
There is a small left-sided pleural effusion. No pneumothoraces
are seen. There is a left retrocardiac opacity which has
developed in the interim.
[**2195-6-27**] Two views of the chest are obtained without comparison
studies. There is peripheral opacity in the right lung
consistent with empyema. There is also a right-sided moderate
effusion. There is fluid tracking along the major fissure. There
is a small left-sided pleural effusion. The upper lung zones are
relatively clear. Heart and mediastinum are within normal
limits.

Pathology: Pleural Tissue Granulation tissue, fibrin, and acute
and chronic inflammation.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 109123**] was transferred from [**Hospital6 **]
for further management of his right pleural effusion.  His IV
Levofloxacin was continued.  He was taken to the operating room
on [**2195-6-29**] for successful Thoracoscopy and decortication of
right lung and Therapeutic bronchoscopy.  He was transferred to
the SICU intubated/sedated overnight with CPAP 10/5/50%. He was
suctioned for moderate amounts of thick secretions. He was
extubated on [**2195-6-30**] and transfer to the floor.

Respiratory: Aggressive pulmonary toilet and nebs were
administered.  He extubated on POD1 to 4L NC with oxygen
saturations 95%.  Over the course of his hospital stay his
oxygen requirement were titrated off with continue aggressive
pulmonary therapy and ambulation.  On discharge his oxygen
saturations at rest 93% with ambulation 92% after obtaining good
pain control.

Chest-Tubes (3):anterior tube was a 28-French right-angle over
the diaphragm, the middle tube was a 24-French directed to the
apex of the right chest and the posterior tube at the skin level
was a posterior chest tube.  The remained to low-wall suction
until [**2195-7-1**] with minimal serosanguinous discharge.  On [**2195-7-1**]
they were converted to Pneumostats.  On [**2195-7-2**] the Middle Apex
tube was removed.  He was discharged with the remaining 2 chest
tube to pneumostats until culture data final.

Chest-Ray: he was followed by serial chest films: see above
reports.

Cardiac: he was started on  prophylactic low dose beta-blocker.
He remained in sinus rhythm 60-70.  He was continued on his ACE
with SBP 130-140.

GI: PPI were continue.  His bowel function returned to [**Location 213**].

Nutrition: He was maintained on IV fluids until he tolerated a
regular diet.

Renal: Foley was removed on [**2195-6-30**] he voided with good urine
output.  His renal function remained normal.

ID: He remained afebrile. He will continue a 14 day course of
Levofloxacin.  Pleural cultures are still pending with no growth
to date.

Pain: Dilaudid PCA converted to PO pain medication with moderate
control.  NSAIDS were started on [**2195-7-2**] with optimal pain
management.

Disposition: he was seen by physical therapy who felt he may
initially require home PT but his ambulation improved and was
discharged home with VNA.  He will follow-up
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks for CCT w/contrast.
