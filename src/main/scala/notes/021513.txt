Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Complete Heart Block

Cardiac catheterization with no interventions.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88012**] is an 84 year old gentleman transferred from
[**Hospital 1474**] hospital for evaluation of complete heart block and
possible coronary intervention.
.
Please see Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 28807**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1474**] Hospital admission note dated
[**10-24**] for full admitting details.  In brief, the patient
presented to dialysis on the morning of [**10-24**] with gross
hematuria.  He makes little to no urine at baseline, but
developed intermittent hematuria 4 months ago that was not
worked up as he attributed it to aspirin.  Aspirin held on
admission, Ab CT performed with Nephrology & Urology consults.
No consult notes, discharge summary or imaging reports included.

.
Per an ICU admit note dated [**10-27**], the patient's abdominal CT
demonstrated an irregularly shapped bladder wall concerning for
neoplasm.  Cystoscopy attempted but unsuccessful due to
hematuria.  He was planned for a biopsy in the OR.  Prior to
biopsy, the patient developed chest pain in the setting of a 10
point Hct drop with an elevated troponin.  Cardiology reportedly
cleared the patient for biopsy, but the morning of the procedure
(and of transfer to the hospital) he developed 3 pauses of about
25 seconds each, twice requiring CPR (no greater specifics)
before generating a 40bpm escape rhythm and was taken to cath
for pacing wire placement and left heart cath.
.
Per the cath report: Diagnostic Cardiologist: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4597**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 88013**], MD. [**First Name (Titles) 4084**] [**Last Name (Titles) 88014**], tachycardic. Developed several
bouts of abdominal pain/pubic pain, never chest pain.  R radial
approach, temp pacer placed, Left heart cath performed, no
report of findings. Drugs received during cath: Atropine 0.5mg
IV x2, Fentanyl, Versed, Zofran, SubQ lidocaine.
.
Per the patient, he presented to [**Hospital1 1474**] on Sunday for
worsening chronic hematuria.  He has clear sensorium, but does
not adequately remember his hospital course.  He does believe he
was shocked twice, once awake and once not conscious.  He denies
ever having chest pain or difficulty breathing.  He does
describe a sensation of abdominal discomfort prior to his team's
cardiac concerns.  He also reports intermittent penile
discomfort with the three way foley in place as though he cannot
urinate.  He has no other complaints at this time.
.
Per the patient's son in law, the patient has had several recent
admissions for dyspnea, ? CHF.
.
Review of systems otherwise negative.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:

ECHO [**10-29**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis of the
inferior wall and inferior septum. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 40-45 %). Right ventricular chamber
size is mildly dilated with normal free wall motion are normal.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Mild regional dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.
.
CT Ab/Pelvis [**10-29**]:
1. Enhancing mass within the base of the bladder on the left
with large
amount of clot within the bladder with associated moderate right

hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Cannot exclude invasion into the
seminal
vesicles. Extensive pelvic and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

2. Large left-sided fat and bowel containing inguinal hernia
with no evidence
of obstruction.

3. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
.
Urine cytology
ATYPICAL.

  Rare atypical urothelial cells, present singly.

  Squamous cells, anucleate squames, neutrophils and red
  blood cells.
.
Carotid studies
Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On
the right there is moderate heterogeneous plaque in the ICA and
CCA. On the
left there is moderate heterogenous plaque in the ICA and CCA.

On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 106/27, 106/22, 90/26 cm/sec. CCA peak
systolic
velocity is 109/17 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 104
cm/sec. The
ICA/CCA ratio is 0.97. These findings are consistent with <40%
stenosis.

On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 73/18, 108/22, 92/20cm/ec. CCA peak
systolic velocity
is 100 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 120cm/sec. The
ICA/CCA ratio is
1.02. These findings are consistent with <40% stenosis.

There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow.
There is antegrade left vertebral artery flow.

Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
