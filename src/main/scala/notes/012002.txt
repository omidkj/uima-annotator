Chief Complaint:
lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
43M h/o chronic pancreatitis, HTN, HLD, DM type 1, diabetic
nephropathy presents with dizziness and hypotension. He reports
that this morning he felt lightheaded, nauseous, and vomited one
time. Yesterday he reports three episodes of diarreha. He denies
any recent sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] states that he has recently had
decrased PO intake, because he had been afraid of eating in the
setting of his recent pancreatitis bout. Additionally, over the
course of his last hospitalization, his diuretics were adjusted,
and he was discharged on torsemide rather than the lasix that he
was previously taking. Today he was driving on the highway when
he became acutely lightheaded and nauseous, he also reported
some abdominal pain. He took vicodin and zofran while driving,
without improvement in his symptoms. His wife then took control
of the car. He went to his PCP's office after his meeting for
assessment of persistent lightheadedness. In the PCP's office he
was found to have SBP of 90. He was sent from the PCP's office
to the ED for further treatment.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.0, 82, 89/53, 20, 100% 4LNC.
Additionally, he was found to have elevated creatinine of 5.2
and lipase 256. He was given a total of 4L NS bolus, and IV
dilaudid for abdominal pain. His blood pressure recovered to
systolics of the 110-120's.

On arrival to the MICU, he reported persistent lightheadedness
and nausea. He denied any abdominal pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
43M with history of DM1, hypertension, asthma, CKD [**1-22**] [**12-22**]
diabetic nephropathy, obesity, chronic pancreatitis presenting
with poor PO intake and hypotension.

# Hypotension: Likely secondary to recent poor PO intake and
dehydration. Also likely contribution from recent changes made
to diuretics. In looking at his discharge summary from [**2192-9-8**],
it appears that his diuretic dose was doubled when converting
from lasix to torsemide, adjusting for strength of dosing.
Following NS IVF boluses in the ED his blood pressure returned
to the normal range, but again became soft shortly after he was
settled into the ED. While in the MICU he was fluid
resuscitated, and his diuretics and antihypertensives were held.
His blood pressure returned to the normal range, and he was safe
for transfer to the floor. His Torosemide was restarted while on
the floor. He remained normotensive and became mildly
hypertensive. He was considered safe for discharge.

# Acute-on-chronic kidney disease: His baseline creatinine is
approximately 2.5, but was elevated to 5.2 on presentation to
the ED. Additionally, he reports decreased urine output. Most
likely pre-renal given poor PO intake and excess diuretics.
While in the MICU his creatinine trended down with IVF
resuscitaiton. As above, his antihypertensive medications and
diuretics were held until the day of discharge when he was noted
to be hemodynamically appropriate in setting of receiving
diuretics.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Type 1 DM: No acive issues while in the MICU. He was
maintained on his home insulin dosing with lantus and HISS.

# OSA: While in the MICU he refused to use CPAP, but reported
that his wife would bring his home machine in the following day.
Overnight he was given supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula.

#Asthma: No active issues. He was given albuterol nebs as
needed.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient carefully instructed on dosage of diuretics at home.
He was also given strict instructions to weigh himself daily and
call his nephrologist immediately if he notes a weight gain.
- His antihypertensives were restarted upon discharge.
