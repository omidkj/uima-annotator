Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo man with severe COPD on home prednisone and O2 presents
with acute-onset COPD exacerbation, requiring intubation.

1) COPD exacerbation/respiratory distress - Patient just D/Ced
home [**5-18**] after 1 day stay for COPD flare.  Given sudden
decline, etiologies considered include pulmonary embolism or
mucus plugging.  CTA was negative. He was initially started on
solumedrol 125 mg IV q8h, then pred taper.  He was also treated
empirically for pneumonia with azithromycin for 5 days, nebs,
and tiotropium. Twice during his stay in the MICU, he had
episodes of flash pulmonary edema that were excerbated by the
patient's anxiety causing an increased RR and breath stacking.
These episodes responded to Lasix with diuresis.

2) EKG changes - inferolateral ST depressions, likely rate
related ischemia in setting of respiratory distress. He ruled
out for an MI and has had a clean cath in the recent past.

3) HTN - Initially, antihypertensives were held since the
patient was intubated. However, once extubated, he continue to
have SBPs in the 80 - 90s secondary to likely dehydration. This
is thought to be due to overdiuresis and the this resolved with
encouaged increased PO intake of fluids.

4) Abdominal Pain - Transient pain that the patient described as
soreness in left lower quadrant, not associated with
constipation.   Pain resolved spontaneously.
