Admission Date:  [**2167-8-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-8-25**]


Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 16129**] OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82 year-old
woman with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, hypothyroidism, and congestive heart
failure who presented with a two week history worsening
mental status changes.  According to the patient's daughter
she had trouble remembering names and her daily routine.  The
patient also exhibited increased urination over the week
prior to presentation, with a new onset of incontinence of
urine.  The patient also had become increasingly dyspneic
over the two weeks prior to presentation.  The patient's
daughter also reported that the patient had been exhibiting
increasing gait instability with two near falls.  It should
be noted that the patient also has a history of a fall a year ago
resulting in a left femur fracture above a knee prosthesis,
and a left hip fracture in the setting of pneumonia in
[**2166-12-18**]. The patient was recently hospitalized prior
to this admission and treated for left lower extremity
cellulitis.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denied headache, blurred
vision, chest pain, palpitations, dysuria, cough, abdominal
pain, diarrhea.  The patient also denied fevers or chills as
well as recent changes in her medication regimen.

It should be noted at this point, that later in the patient's
hospitalization she developed sinus node dysfunction and
required placement of a pacemaker.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, hypothyroidism, gout,
questionable obstructive pulmonary disease.  No pulmonary
function
tests available.  Reported history of congestive heart
failure.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  Status post left total
knee replacement, left femur fixation with intramedullary rod,
and left hip repair.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol two puffs q.i.d.,
Allopurinol 100 mg q day, aspirin 81 mg q day, Buspar 5 mg
t.i.d., Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d., potassium chloride
10 milliequivalents q day, Lasix 20 mg po q day, Levoxyl 75
mcg q day.  Multi vitamin, Tums 500 mg b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient prior to presentation lived in
an [**Hospital3 **] facility.  The patient has a daughter who
is very involved in her care.  The patient has a past tobacco
abuse history, she quit approximately fifteen years ago.  The
patient denies past alcohol use.

CODE STATUS:  Full code.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  As reported by the
admitting team, vital signs temperature 97.7.  Heart rate 62.
Blood pressure 125/60.  Respiratory rate 22 sating 91% on
room air and 95% on 5 liters.  General, the patient was found
to be somnolent and irritable, but in no acute distress.
HEENT moist mucous membranes.  Head was normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Neck no JVD.  Cardiovascular regular rate and
rhythm.  Distant S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Respiratory, poor
air exchange throughout.  No rhonchi, rales or wheezes
bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender, mildly distended.
Positive bowel sounds.  Positive erythema under abdominal
pannus.  Extremities, 1+ pitting edema, which is symmetric
and bilateral.  Neurological, strength 5 out of 5 at the
upper extremities.  Poor lower extremity effort for strength.
Tongue in midline.  Patellar deep tendon reflexes not
obtainable.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Chem 7 revealed a white
count of 7.4 with a differential of 75% neutrophils, 18%
lymphocytes and 4% monocytes.  Hematocrit was 41.4, platelets
164.  Chem 7 revealed a sodium of 145, potassium 4.6,
chloride 101, bicarb 36, BUN 44 and creatinine 1.7 and
glucose of 70.  Liver function tests were evaluated.  ALT was
28, AST 21, LD 199, CK was cycled several times and normal
times six.  Alkaline phosphatase 109.  Other electrolytes
included calcium, which is 9.2, phosphorus 3.9, magnesium
2.0, albumin was 3.6 on presentation.

Other notable laboratory data during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course included TSH, which was normal at 3.8.  Iron studies
were sent including TIBC, ferritin, and transferrin.  These
were within normal limits.  Also haptoglobin was sent and
found to be 183.  The patient's vitamin B-12 was in the
low normal range, but folate was normal. Erythrocyte
sedimentation rate was sent and found to be 10, within normal
limits.  Of note, the patient was found to be [**Doctor First Name **] positive
with a titer of 1:40.

Electrocardiogram on admission, flipped T waves were evident
throughout the precordium.  The patient had a right bundle
branch block pattern.  There were no acute ST or T changes.
Chest x-ray on admission, question of a right middle lobe
infiltrate as well as possible left lower lobe infiltrate.
CT of the head without contrast on admission revealed
ventricles and sulci, which were symmetrically enlarged
consistent with age related brain atrophy.  There were
regions of low attenuation in the periventricular white
matter most likely due to chronic microvascular infarction.
There was no acute hemorrhage, mass effect or extra axial
collection.  Bone windows demonstrated no fractures.
Echocardiogram, [**2167-8-14**], revealed mild left
ventricular hypertrophy, 2+ mitral regurgitation, decreased
right ventricular systolic function, moderate aortic
stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation, severe pulmonary
hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2167-8-12**] after a two week history of progressive mental status
changes, which included confusion, poor memory, and
difficulty with daily routines as well as increased frequency
of urination and a one week history of new onset urinary
incontinence.  The patient also presented with a two week
history of dyspnea as well as increasing gait instability.

The patient was admitted initially to the ACOVE team.  She
was ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial enzymes, as
noted above.  A subsequent echocardiogram on [**2167-8-14**] revealed the above noted findings including pulmonary
hypertension.

The patient was treated for a urinary tract infection
initially with Ceftriaxone.  However, a rash which
had been present on her neck prior to institution of Ceftriaxone
became dramatically worse, spreading to her face and chest, so
the Ceftriaxone was changed to Cipro ([**8-15**]).  The patient
subsequently developed a bulla on
her left lower shin as well as a papular rash on her feet.
On [**8-15**] and 30 the patient was noted to have
asymptomatic pauses in her heart rate with rate running into
the 20s.  The patient reportedly responded to atropine.  The
patient was also noted at a separate time to have
desaturations to the low 70s on room air.  Her arterial blood
gas at that time revealed a pH of 7.26, PCO2 93, PO2 45.  On
[**8-17**], she was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] MICU in hopes
of trying BIPAP, but she was too delirious at the time to
cooperate with the trial.  She also had an episode of rapid (170)
atrial fibrillation that day, and developed severe bradycardia
(pause of 8 seconds and HR 20 - 30) when treated with Lopressor.
Because of the patient's sinus node dysfunction she was taken
for dual chamber pacer placement on [**2167-8-18**] and
subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] team.

The remainder of the hospital course will be described by
problem list as follows:

Cardiovascular:  1.  Rate and rhythm.  On the morning of
[**8-20**] the patient was found to be tachycardic to the
120s.  The possible etiologies for this included the fact
that the patient became more delirious again and refused to take
her Lopressor and Amiodarone. Also the
electrophysiology service performed several interrogations of the
pacemaker and adjusted the sensitivities.  They were
subsequently satisfied that the pacer was placed correctly
and working well.  Through the remainder of the patient's
hospitalization the patient was monitored on telemetry with
occasional premature ventricular contractions being noted.
Otherwise, the patient did not have any difficulty with her
rate or rhythm.  The patient is to be placed on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of
