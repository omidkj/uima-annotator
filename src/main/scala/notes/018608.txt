Date of Birth:   [**2085-4-10**]       Sex:  F

Service:  RESIDENT ONLY MEDICINE

ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum to a previous dictation of
[**2163-2-27**].

Please see the previously dictated discharge summary dated
[**2163-2-27**] and [**2163-2-17**] for complete hospitalization
course of this patient.  The following dictation will recount
the events and plan since [**2163-2-27**].

In summary, this is a 77-year-old female who is status post
recent total knee replacement and hip fracture in [**2163-2-24**] who was admitted from [**Hospital3 **] with
fever on [**2163-2-3**].  She was found to have MRSA
bacteremia and epidural abscess, status post debridement on
[**2163-2-17**] in the Operating Room by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1338**].
Her postoperative course was notable for intubation,
aspiration pneumonia.  She continues on IV vancomycin for the
MRSA bacteremia and the epidural abscess and has been
recovering on the floor since then.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS
AUREUS BACTEREMIA/EPIDURAL ABSCESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is
currently on day number 19 of vancomycin since her OR
debridement on [**2163-2-17**] and she will need to complete a
total of [**9-6**] weeks of treatment by levels per the
Infectious Disease specialist.  Surveillance blood cultures
on [**2163-3-3**] were negative and the patient has been
afebrile without leukocytosis since [**2163-2-27**].  She will
need her vancomycin levels checked three times per week and
to dose vancomycin 1 gram IV for a level of less than or
equal to 15.

2.  ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is status post a 14
day course of vancomycin/Zosyn which was later changed to
vancomycin/aztreonam (she had elevated creatinine on Zosyn).
She is status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
and a follow-up failed speech and swallow test on [**2163-3-4**] for all consistencies occurred.  She remained n.p.o.
until she is able to pass a speech and swallow test.

3.  OXYGEN REQUIREMENT:  This has been improving.  A chest
x-ray on [**2163-3-7**] demonstrated an improvement and
perihilar haziness but continued upper zone vascular
redistribution.  She continues to have small bilateral
pleural effusions and a left retrocardiac opacity but these
are unchanged compared with previous chest x-rays.  She is
also noted to have increased opacity in her right middle and
right lower lobes consistent with atelectasis or possible
infection.

As of [**2163-3-8**], she is saturating 98% on 1.5 liters and
this will be weaned off as tolerated.

4.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  An echocardiogram on [**2163-2-21**] demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50%.  Chest x-rays
in early [**Month (only) 547**] demonstrated significant fluid overload which
was confirmed on examination with 2+ pitting edema and
increased oxygen requirement. She has been diuresed 1-2
liters daily since early [**Month (only) 547**] with improvement of signs of
CHF on chest x-ray.  Lasix diuresis will be continued with a
dose of 40 mg IV b.i.d. until this total body fluid overload
is improved.  This will be done with caution to her renal
function.

5.  DIABETES/HYPERGLYCEMIA:  Despite increasing levels of
Glargine, the patient continued to have elevated glucose
levels during the daytime.  [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center was
consulted and has devised a regimen of 30 units of Lantus in
the evening and a Humalog scale q. four hours which will be
enclosed with her discharge summary.  Her blood sugars remain
below 200 on this regimen.

6.  RENAL:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is status post ATN from gentamicin
toxicity which has been fully resolving with a steadily
improving creatinine daily.  Her creatinine has steadily
improved despite Lasix 40 mg IV b.i.d.  An extra dose of
Lasix was given on [**2163-3-6**] with a bump in her
creatinine the next day from 2.8 to 3.0.  However, without
extra Lasix diuresis her creatinine continues to come down.
Free water boluses have been given through her PEG tube as
needed for hypernatremia.

7.  MENTAL STATUS:  The patient had some delirium and
continues to have some waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status but
this has been improving daily with resolution of her medical
issues.

8.  PSYCHIATRY:  The patient is depressed.  Social Work has
been involved and psychiatric evaluation has been considered.
Also, treated with SSRI has been considered but has been
delayed awaiting improved mental status.

9.  HYPERTENSION:  Metoprolol was increased to 150 mg b.i.d.
but persistent systolic blood pressure remained elevated on
this to approximately 160s.  Additional antihypertensives
will be added and will be included in the discharge summary.

10.  PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient has been in
normal sinus rhythm for approximately one week on Amiodarone
and beta blocker.  Anticoagulation had been discussed but was
decided against given her tenuous condition and her need for
significant physical therapy and balance issues at this
point.

11.  CANDIDURIA:  The patient had urine cultures in early
[**Month (only) 547**] positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**].  This was resolved after a seven
day course of fluconazole IV and a urine culture on [**2163-3-4**] was negative for [**Female First Name (un) 564**].

12.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient has
had goal tube feeds with .................... at 45 cc per
hour and has required daily phosphate repletion secondary to
her renal failure.

13.  ANEMIA:  The patient has required several blood
transfusions but her hematocrit has been stable at 30 or over
for over one week now.  Iron studies and B12 and folate were
within normal limits but demonstrated an anemia of chronic
disease.

14.  ACCESS:  The patient has a right PICC in place.

15.  COMMUNICATION:  The patient's communication has been
with the patient and her husband as well as other members of
the family.

16.  CODE STATUS:  The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

17.  DISPOSITION:  To rehabilitation pending.
