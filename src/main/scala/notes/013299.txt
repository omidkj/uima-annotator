.
admission ekg
Sinus tachycardia. Baseline artifact. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2177-6-2**] there is new inferolateral ST segment depression and
the rate
has increased. Followup and clinical correlation are suggested.
.
repeat ekg
Sinus arrhythmia. Within normal limits. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2177-6-9**] tachycardia and minor ST-T wave abnormalities have
resolved.
.
admission cxr
New ill-defined airspace opacity within the right lung base and
to a lesser degree within the right mid lung field. These
findings could
represent an infectious process or aspiration.
.
CT CHEST
1. Diffuse ground-glass opacities predominantly in the right
middle and lower lobes with focal areas of consolidation at the
right lung base concerning for pneumonia. Interval resolution of
ground-glass opacities in the superior segment of the left lower
lobe and left upper lobe. All these findings can be explained by
recurrent aspiration.
2. Circumferential narrowing of the bronchus intermedius
secondary to wall thickening indicative of acute inflammation.
3. Interval placement of Y-stent in the trachea and main stem
bronchi.
.
BRONCHOSCOPY
Patent stent with moderate amount of thin secretions. No
significant granulation tissue.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 61 y/o F hx asthma, relapsing
polychondritis, severe tracheobronchomalacia recently s/p Y
stent by IP on [**6-3**] presented with 5 days worsening SOB, cough,
fever, leukocytosis and new infiltrate on CXR c/w PNA.
.
#. Hypoxia/ PNA: . She was initially admitted to the ICU from
the ED for respiratory distress. Given initial presentation and
CXR findings, PNA was considered most likely source of her
hypoxemia which resolved prior to discharge Bronchoscopy notable
only for thin secretions. Leukocytosis resolved with 48 hours of
Vanc/ CTX/ azithro. BAL revealed only gram+ organisms in pairs
and chains, further speciation pending at the time of discharge
and requiring follow-up. Pt discharged on a course of augmentin
and azithromycin for community acquired PNA. Pt instructed to
schedule f/u with her PCP w/in one week and with her
pulmonologist w/in one month of discharge.
.
# Asthma: albuterol/atrovent nebs given while inpt with good
effect. prior outpt regimen continued at discharge.
.
#. Relapsing Polychondritis: Currently inactive. Considering her
decreased ability to clear secretions s/p y-stent, she may
benefit from a reduction in her immunosuppressants as her
disease permits--no dose changes made during this admission.
