History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66402**] is a 73 y/o man with a history of diabetes, coronary
artery disease s/p CABG >20 years ago, h/o VT s/p abdominal ICD
and admission in [**9-2**] for VT storm w/exchange of ICD, Ischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF 25-30%, severe mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation, Chronic renal failure, hypertension,
who is admitted to the CCU after presenting to [**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 47**] when his ICD fired several times in
succession this morning.
.
Approximetly 1 week prior to this episode, he was admitted to
[**Hospital1 **] with a similar presentation. During that admission he
was apparently loaded with IV amiodarone and discharged on
amiodarone 200mg po qday. Full discharge summary pending.
.
He did well until sunday [**11-27**], the morning of his
admission here. He was getting dressed for the morning when his
ICD began firing. He believes that it went off 5 or 6 times. He
presented to [**Hospital1 **] where he was started on an amiodarone
drip as well as given a bolus of lidocaine 50mg IV. He was not
started on a lido drip. He was subsequently transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
for consideration of further EP study.
.
On review of systems he denies increased dyspnea, denies angina
or resting chest pain (outside of ICD shocks), and denies
syncope or pre-syncope. He has not had orthopnea or lower
extremity edema. He denies fevers or chills. He does note that
he had nausea when amiodarone was tried in the past, and that he
seems to be developing that again with recently restarting amio
earlier this week.

Physical Exam:
98.7 70 128/70 20 965RA

best at LLSB and over mitral area that does not radiate to
carotids
RESP: crackles bilaterally @ bases of lungs

Pertinent Results:
LABS: From [**Hospital **] hospital drawn on day of admission to [**Hospital1 18**]
([**11-27**]) were notable for Cr 2.2, CO2 21, Troponin T 0.34, Hct 37,
WBC 10, PLT 179
.
EKG: atrial pacing @ 70bpm, QRS 130 with LBBB pattern. nl axis.

.
TELEMETRY: frequent runs of NSVT
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2135-9-22**]:
EF 25-30%, inferior hypokinesis, 3+MR, 4+TR
.
[**2135-11-29**] 12:20 pm BLOOD CULTURE STAPH AUREUS COAG +
ERYTHROMYCIN---------- =>8 R

CARDIAC ECHO [**11-5**]: No distinct vegetations are seen. However,
there appears to be a para-mitral annular ring leak at the base
of the anterior leaflet. Marked left atrial dilation. Complex
atheromas. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.

CT HEAD: In comparison with the prior study, no significant
changes are demonstrated. Persistent areas of low attenuation in
the subcortical white matter and left frontal lobe consistent
with a chronic ischemic event and small vessel disease. Dense
atherosclerotic calcifications noted in the carotid siphons and
left vertebral artery. If there is any clinical concern related
with an acute/subacute ischemic event, correlation with MRI is
recommended if clinically warranted.


Brief Hospital Course:
73 y/o man with CAD, CHF, admitted for refractory ventricular
tachycardia
.
# Ventricular Tachycardia: He has failed several drug regemins,
largely due to GI intolerence, as well as the multiple foci of
excitable ventricular myocardium.  He was recently on
quinidine/mexilitine, but quinidine was discontinued due to GI
intolerance.  Had breakthrough VT on mexilitine on presentation
to [**Hospital1 **].  There he was loaded on amiodarone IV and
continued on mexilitine on discharge along with 200mg
amiodarone, but continued to have VT, apparently refractory to
his anti-tachycardic pacing.  EP evaluation considered him
unlikely to respond well to further ablation.  He was loaded
with amiodorone IV and transitioned to PO, as well as mixilitine
TID.  He has some significant apprehesive nausea and was given
omeprazole and zofran for nausea.  He was monitored on telemetry
and had no episodes.  EP had recommended lidocaine 50-100mg
bolus then [**1-26**]/min gtt in the event of an episode.
.
# MRSA Bacteremia: On [**11-29**], he became febrile to 102 PO (104
rectal) and developed dyspnea.  He was started on Levaquin and
Vancomycin [**11-29**].  Blood cultures eventually grew [**4-29**] MRSA.  Pt
also noted to have purulent drainage from left IV site started
at OSH (culture now growing Staph Aureus).  Subsequent LUE
Ultrasound positive for DVT.  Pt hads been HD stable afebrile
since [**11-29**] however o/n he became hypotensive o/n requiring
transient pressors.  A right IJ central line was placed for HD
monitoring and was subsequently removed.  A TTE showed a small
vegitation which was not seen on TTE, but TTE showed para-mitral
annular ring leak at the base of the anterior leaflet.  He will
need to complete 6 weeks of IV vancomycin from [**11-30**].  He has a
chronic abdominal hematoma.  Ultrasound showed 6.8 cm complex
cystic mass, without sign of infection, thus it was not drained.
.
# UE DVT: Patient had a UE thrombophlebitis that was was
confirmed by US.  He will remain on anticoagulation with lovenox
bridge to Coumadin and 6 weeks of IV antibiotics [**2135-11-30**]-
[**2136-1-4**].
.
# Cardiac asthma: He was noted to have positional expiratory
wheezing that worsened in the setting of volume overload and
appeared to improve with diuresis.  A neck CT to r/o subglottic
lesion was considered but deferred given his improvement with
diuresis.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:   Cr peaked at 3.5 from
baseline of 2.3 in setting of hypoperfusion during sepsis.  He
returned to baseline prior to discharge.
.
# CAD: He was continued on aspirin and ezetimibe (intolerant of
statins).  Pt's BB and ACE were held given sepsis, and restarted
slowly based on BP and renal function. Prior to discharge ACEi
was returned to home dose and BB dose adjusted.
.
# DM: Outpatient glyburide was held and he was maintainted on a
regular insulin sliding scale.
