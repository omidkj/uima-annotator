Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, the patient is a [**Age over 90 **]
year old female, with an extensive past medical history
including coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction in [**2162**], and [**2163**], and percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty of the right coronary artery in [**2162**],
congestive heart failure with ejection fraction estimated at
40%, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, who on [**2168-12-4**], had been
feeling very fatigued but without chest pain or shortness of
breath or palpitations, who fell while walking to the
bathroom where she lives and sustained injury to her right
shoulder and right hip.

She was transferred to the Emergency Department after calling
EMS  She was found to have fractures in the proximal right
humerus and the right hip including the right greater
trochanteric avulsion fracture.  She was given Morphine for
pain control in the Emergency Department. Shortly thereafter,
she became unresponsive with systolic blood pressure of 40
and a heart rate of 70, normal sinus rhythm.  Several minutes
later, she awoke spontaneously and regained her blood
pressure to the 100s.

The patient experienced an additional such incident with a
systolic blood pressure at 60, heart rate 70, again resolving
spontaneously.  She received fluids in the Emergency
Department and maintained a systolic blood pressure in the
80s to 100s and continued to mentate clearly and breathe
comfortably.  Electrocardiogram and chest x-ray in the
Emergency Department revealed no pathology.

The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for observation after two episodes of unresponsiveness and
hypotension in the Emergency Department.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her physical examination on
presentation, in general an elderly female in no acute
distress, moderate amount of pain secondary to multiple
fractures.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination
revealed atraumatic, normocephalic head.  The pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements are intact.  Anicteric.  The neck
examination was supple with positive carotid bruits
bilaterally.  Chest - poor effort, decreased breath sounds at
the bases without wheezing.  Her heart was regular in rate
and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 with a II/VI systolic
ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.  Her
abdomen was distended with no significant tenderness to
palpation, no guarding or rebound.  Her extremities were
warm.  She had an obvious external rotation to the right leg.
Her neurologic examination was nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:   X-ray of the right shoulder revealed a
right humerus fracture at the neck without dislocation.  Her
right hip was status post total hip replacement with an
intertrochanteric fracture and avulsion of the greater
trochanter noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction based on enzymes and received a bedside
echocardiogram in the Medical Intensive Care Unit which
revealed systolic ejection fraction of 40%.  The patient had
a right internal jugular triple lumen central line placed on
[**2168-12-4**], at around 7:00 a.m. for vascular access.

The patient was seen by the cardiology service on [**2168-12-4**],
during the day and eventually cleared for surgery by
orthopedics.  The patient remained stable without further
episodes of unresponsiveness and hypotension in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  She was taken to the operating room on
[**2168-12-6**], by orthopedics where she underwent right gamma nail
fixation of her right hip fracture.  Right shoulder, right
humerus fracture was placed in a sling.

The patient remained stable postoperatively without
complaints and was ready for transfer to the floor on
[**2168-12-6**], where she was accepted by the Medicine [**Hospital1 **]
team.  She was transfused one unit packed red blood cells and
pretreated with 20 mg intravenous Lasix on arrival to the
floor for a hematocrit of 27.9.  Repeat hematocrit on
[**2168-12-7**], revealed a hematocrit of 28.9.  The patient was
again transfused one unit of packed red blood cells and
pretreated with 20 mg intravenous Lasix times one.  Repeat
hematocrit on [**2168-12-8**], was 30.0.  On [**2168-12-8**], the patient
was started on low dose Fentanyl patch to better manage pain
which the patient reported as considerable.  The patient was
also treated with Dilaudid and Percocet p.r.n. for the above
pain.

The patient was seen by physical therapy and initially made
poor progress secondary to pain but slowly began to improve
strength and range of motion.

On [**2168-12-9**], the patient's hematocrit was 32.0.  Pain was
better under control.  The patient began complaining of
constipation and reported last bowel movement nine days prior
and aggressive bowel regimen was instituted.  On [**2168-12-10**],
the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 28.7 and was
once again transfused one unit packed red blood cells
pretreated with 20 mg intravenous Lasix.  The patient was
also restarted on her daily Lasix regimen as per home.

Expected date of discharge is [**2168-12-12**], to [**Hospital6 11896**] Rehabilitation.  Addendum to this discharge
summary will follow.
