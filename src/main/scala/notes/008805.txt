History of Present Illness:
60 yo [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 4746**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14750**] CAD s/p CABG x6, s/p MI x 2 (IMI, also NQWMI
[**11-3**]), s/p recent SVG ->RCA DES ([**11-13**]), CHF (EF 30%), AVR,
afib, DM2, COPD recently admitted NQWMI ([**2188-11-8**]) was cath 3VD
(LMCA 30%, mid LAD 50%, RCx 80%) so he was stented SVG-PDA.
During that admission EGD performed: gastric mass w/ non

taking heparin/integrelin for AVR.  Pt was DC home ([**11-16**]) only
to return ([**11-22**]) c/o melena, LH HCT 25 so pt admitted MICU
where pt given 4U PRBC, FFP, and K.  Given stable hct, pt was tx
to floor.

wave abnormalities
as previously recorded on [**2188-11-22**] without diagnostic interim
change.

invasion through muscularis propria, paraesophageal nodes

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 60M H/O CHF/CAD/CABG/MI S/P Recent Stenting/Plavix w/ GIB
and Gastric Mass awaiting GI imaging and interventions.

1) GI/Heme: EGD repeated, which showed injected mass in distal
esophagus/cardia.  CT scan next performed showed pre and
paratracheal enlarged LAD + smaller LAD along lesser curvature
of stomach.  Endoscopic u/s next performed which showed non
resectable T3 lesion invading into muscularis propria w/ nodal
involvement, so LAD and mass biopsied for likely Stage III
Esophageal Carcinoma.  Pt has minimum of T3N1 (Stage III)
esophageal mass highly suggestive of carcinoma at GE jxn and
path pending.  Endoscopic resection not possible given fungating
mass w/ LAD spread; Surgery not actively pursued given increased
operative mortality given cardiac risk factors.  Trend Hct TID
reveals hemodynamically stable and no clinical signs of bleeding
x 3 days while pt had 2 large bore IVs, protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **], and
DC coumadin/heparin per cardiology to minimize potential risk of
GI bleeding.  We have arranged pt to F/U w/ med onc on [**2188-12-2**],
rad onc to be determined and [**Doctor First Name **] onc on [**2188-12-8**].  We have
resumed pt's outpt meds including anti-hypertensives.  Note path
results will be back on [**2188-11-29**] so please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9363**].
Pt to resume regular diet as tolerated, preferably soft diet.


2) CVS: Pt has extensive cardiac hx w/ negative cardiac enzymes
and EKG.
Pt exhibited mildly increased daily weight so lasix was
temporarily held for risk of hypotension.  Furthermore, given
the predicament of AVR anticoagulation vs. bleeding GI mass,
cardiology was consulted who recommended DC coumadin/heparin but
maintain on plavix for total 4 weeks given the lower mortality
for stroke vs. bleed.  Please continue Plavix for two more
weeks, lipitor, lisinopril, metoprolol, daily weights.  We are
currently holding heparin, coumadin, and ASA despite AVR per
cardiology because the risk of mortality from CVA approx 5-10%,
but the mortality from GI bleed is higher(please see above).  So
PLEASE HOLD HEPARIN, COUMADIN, AND ASA.  PLAVIX FOR TWO MORE
WEEKS ONLY (TOTAL OF 4 WEEKS).

3) DMII: Today advanced pt's diet to regular diet as tolerated
and resume pt's outpt insulin 50U qAM + qHS while RISS.

4) Pulmonary: Clinical right basilar crackles likely secondary
to esophageal mass.  Pt oxygenating well during hospitalization.
 Resume lasix.

5) Rheum: steroid dependent RA maintained on acetaminophen.

6) PPX: Ambulate & PPI.

7) Code: DNR/DNI

8) Comm: Talked w/ wife and daughter concerning new diagnosis
for pt.
