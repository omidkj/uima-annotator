EKG:
[**2169-5-21**] 00:45 @ [**Location (un) 620**]: SR 95bpm, q in II, III, aVF; 4-9mm STE
in V1-V4, 1mm STE V5, 1mm STD in V6; 1mm STD II, 2mm STD III,
aVF;
.
[**5-21**] 2:33 @ [**Hospital1 18**] post-cath: ST 78bpm, q in II, III, aVF, 1-2mm
jpt elevations in V2-3 w/ hyperacute TW;
.
[**2-/2169**] ETT w/ symptoms, s/p p-mibi and stress echo both
reportedly negative
.
[**2169-5-21**] cath:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation
demonstrated
one vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA, RCA, and LCX had
no
angiographically apparent disease.  The LAD had a proximal 95%
stenosis
with thrombus, TIMI 3 flow upon entry.
2. Resting hemodynamics after PCI demonstrated elevated filling
pressures with mRAP of 17 mmHg and mPCWP of 25 mmHg.  There was
severe
pulmonary hypertension with PASP of 60 mmHg and mPAP of 42 mmHg.
 There
was moderate systemic hypertension with SBP of 158 mmHg.  The
cardiac
output and cardiac index were preserved 5.6 L/min and 2.7
L/min/m2,
respectively.
3. Successful primary PCI for acute anterior STEMI with baloon
angioplasty using a 3.5x20mm Esprit Rx perfusion balloon. (See
PTCA
comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel (LAD) coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated filling pressures.
3. Preserved cardiac index.
.
[**2169-5-22**] Echo
 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
 2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed, EF 50%. Septal
hypokinesis is present.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo male with history of DMII, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, ASA allergy admitted with STEMI s/p cath
with PCI for aspirin desensitization.
.
CAD - He had an STEMI. He had PCI of his LAD on arrival. Post
cath we started sulfinpyrazone 200mg po bid for antiplatelet
activity, plavix, integrillin gtt x 18 hours, statin, beta
blocker ACE inhibitor. He had PCI of his LAD. His enzymes began
to trend down on HD 2. He underwent aspirin desensitization
without complications.
He had an echo that showed an EF of 50% with only mildly
depressed function. He should return for repeat cath in 3 months
and at that time a stent may be placed in his LAD depending on
the findings.
.
CHF - He had elevated filling pressures w/ PCWP 19, and was
diuresed gently. This was likely a result of the MI and brief
depressed cardiac function causing elevated pressures.
.
DMII - We initially held glyburide. He was covered with RISS
while in house. We resumed glyburide at discharge.
.
ARF - His creatinine was elevated on admission to 1.3. This was
felt to be secondary to poor renal perfusion secondary to his
MI. His creatinine returned to baseline on HD 2.
