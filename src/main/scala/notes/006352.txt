Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4963**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiacentesis

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 72 yo F who was initially admitted to the surgical
service on [**7-31**] with the chief complaint of dyspnea.  Echo was
performed and found pericardial effusion with tamponade
physiology prompting an admission to [**Hospital **] hospital.
Additionally at the outside hospital a CT was done at [**Doctor First Name **] that
showed aortitis. The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further work up and evaluation.

Patient was transferred to CT surgery service with rheumatology
consult that recommended an MRI/A for signs of vasculitis of the
chest.  This showed aoritis that was confirmed on repeat CT
chest.  Additionally a number of additional labs were ordered
that showed normal compliment levels, elevated CRP, normal
[**Doctor First Name **]/ANCA, normal SPEP.

Pericardiocentesis and drain was placed on [**8-4**].  Evaluation of
the pericardial fluid revealed MSSA bacteria and leukocytosis
with monocytic predominance. For which ID was consulted ( of
note patient had an Ecoli UTI and was treated with cipro from
[**Date range (1) 74440**]).  They recommended brucella serologies (negative),
RPR and other serologies that have been negative.  Vancomycin
was started for broad spectrum (prior to culture data being
known).  Opthomology consulted on the patient and found no
retinal disease.  Temporal artery biopsy was taken on [**8-8**].
Additionally the patient was started on doxycycline for
treatment given positive IgM for mycoplasma.  On the 20th the
renal function began to worsen and nephrology consult was
obtained on [**8-9**] with differential being vasculitis or
medication side effect primarily.


Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:
Renal US [**2194-8-9**]: No hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid
collection

CXR [**2194-8-10**]
The heart is enlarged, tortuosity of the aorta is present.
There is a new onset of diffuse interstitial markings with
bilateral pleural effusions consistent with cardiac failure.

CXR [**2194-8-16**] - IMPRESSION: Improving CHF.

[**2194-8-8**] - Temporal Artery Biopsy - Arterial vascular segment, no
diagnostic abnormalities recognized.

ECHO - [**2194-8-12**] - Conclusions:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. The
effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or
other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic
collapse is seen.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-8-8**],
the pericardial effusion is slightly smaller.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo F with history of pericardial effusion s/p
pericardiocentesis on [**8-4**], aortitis, diabetes and new renal
failure transferred from surgery for further management.

#. Pericardial effusion - Unclear etiology. Low voltage on EKG.
Fluid from pericardiocentesis showed reactive fluid but negative
for malignant cells. +MSSA treated with IV vancomycin for 5
days.  Antibiotics d/c'd as positive culture felt to be
contaminant given sparse growth and the patient's very stable
clinical picture.  Patient also was myoplasma + which was also
felt to be a false positive.  Was treated with 2 days of
doxcycline that was also d/c'd.  Repeat ECHO showed only small
pericardial effusion that was smaller with each repeat scan.
Histo, Legionella, and current EBV infxn negative.  No Bence
[**Doctor Last Name **] proteins in urine.  Cryptococcus negative.
- Pleural Fluid, smear negative for TB, culture still pending
- Lyme Ab was negative

#. Aortitis - found by CT chest. ANCA, C3/C4, [**Doctor First Name **], ACA, RPR, TB
smear all negative. Temporal biopsy negative for diagnostic
abnormalities. No role for steroids felt to be warranted. CRP
252 at peak, 46 later in hospital course.

#. Acute renal failure - Patient with acute rise in Cr from 0.7
on [**8-6**] to 2.4-2.7. It was 1.7 on discharge.  No evidence of
hydronephrosis or mass on renal ultrasound. No improvement with
IVFs, in fact, worsened volume overload. FeNa was <1%.  Likely
the combined result of contrast, cardiac cath and vancomycin,
slowly improving. Renal followed the patient while here and
aided in management. UPEP also tested and negative. Patient will
need repeat chem-7 within a week of discharge.

#. s/p R CVA w/ resolving L hemiparesis [**4-/2194**]-The patient had
possible episode of TIA while in hospital on [**8-10**], with possible
paresthesia but no neurological residual deficits. She was
continued on aspirin.

#. Urinary Tract Infection - Had an E.coli pansensitive UTI,
treated with 5 days of Cipro

# Volume overload- Patient autodiuresed but did have residual
lower extremity edema on discharge. Her CXR showed small
bilateral pleural effusions and interstitial pattern. BNP was
checked day prior to discharge and was 2449. She was given
lasix. On discharge, ambulatory O2 sat was in the mid 90 %.

#. DM- was on a RISS initially but fingersticks were well
controlled.

#. HTN- patient was continued on atenolol which was started at a
lower dose but uptitrated back up to 50mg daily before
discharged

# Elevated alkaline phosphatase-AP peaked at 519, last value
222. GGT was 149. This will need to be further worked up as an
outpatient.

#. FEN- Cardiac heart healthy diet. Electrolytes repleted prn.

#. PPx- Heparin Sc, senna, colace
