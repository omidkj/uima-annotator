History of Present Illness:
65M h/o esophageal dysmotility, aspiration PNA s/p PEG
tube,Churg [**Doctor Last Name 3532**], COPD and MS presents with 1 day of SOB and
fevers. Today 7 AM at [**Hospital3 **] pt looked disheveled,
glassy eyes, flushed, temp 100.4 HR 99. RR 28. Put in bed and on
O2 at 3-6L but never really got into the 90s (around 88%). Pt
was coughing and nurse [**First Name (Titles) 33166**] [**Last Name (Titles) 107177**] wheeze on the right with
decreased sounds on the right. Gave duoneb and he coughed up
yellow thick sputum. Pt never lost consciousness. He then
complained of midsternal discomfort, then developed nausea prior
to arrival of EMTs but no vomiting. Then c/o L sided chest pain
without radiation. Of note, pt does get 25mg morphine q6hrs prn
for chronic back pain (usually receives all doses) and also uses
a fentanyl patch.
.
In addition, he was recently treated for a urinary tract
infection - OSH Ucx [**2171-3-25**]: Proteus [**Last Name (un) 36**] to cefepime. He also
reports having a chronic right ear infection that he told was
"granuloma" and has been using cipro ear drops for this.
.
On arrival to the ED, vital signs were 100.6 97 107/54 28
92%10L.
Pt was noted to be tachypneic, uncomfortable, with loud wet
cough on exam. Had bilateral diffuse rhonchi and wheezing. G
tube with mild purulent discharge.
Labs showed

proBNP: 83
UA negative
ABG while on bipap 7.44/44/104/31/4
CXR showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.
Pt ws given methylpred 125mg IV, nebs, vanc/cefepime/flagyl.
Received 2mg IV morphine for chest pain whch subsequently
improved. He was started on Bipap for respiratory distress which
was discontinued after 30 minutes.  Pt was admitted to the ICU
for presumed COPD exacerbation vs pneumonia. Vitals prior to
transfer: 98.5 ??????F (36.9 ??????C), Pulse: 85, RR: 20, BP: 97/47,
O2Sat: 93, O2Flow: NRB.
.
In the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt satting low 90s on NRB and 6L NC. Within the
first 20 minutes of his arrival pt was actively becoming
increasingly somnolent. He had to be shaken to arouse and answer
questions but was arousable. BP 110s/70s HR 80s. Repeat ABG
showed 7.42/44/68/30/3. Lactate:0.7. After roughly 1 hour of
sleeping pt woke up and was fully alert, oriented and
interactive. Reported feeling tired after not sleeping all
night.

Physical Exam:
ON ADMISSION:
Vitals: T: 98.9 BP:108/54 P:87 R:15 O2:  91% 100% facemask and
6L NC.
General: no acute distress. somnolent but arousable.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: very poor air movemment throughout but clear to
auscultation bilaterally.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops. distant heart sounds
Abdomen: NTND, hypoactive bowel sounds, Gtube site without
drainage or erythema.
GU: no foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.
Pt with asterixis.

ON DISCHARGE [**2171-4-20**]:
Vitals: T 98.2, P 71 (50-70s), BP 116/69 (90-130/60-70s), R 18,
O2 95% on 4L NC.
Gen: alert, well appearing, NAD
Psych: normal affect/mood
CV: RRR no m/g
Chest: fentanyl patch noted on anterior R chest
Lung: slight bibasilar crackles, no wheeze, good air movement.
Occasional "junky" cough but no rhonchi on exam.
Abdomen: PEG tube noted, +BS, nondistended, mild R abd
tenderness (which pt says is chronic since PEG placement)
Extremities: no LE edema


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2171-4-17**]:
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities likely represent combination of
atelectasis and scarring given patient's history of chronic
aspiration. However, underlying pneumonia in the lower lobes
cannot be ruled out.
.
[**2171-4-18**] RUQ U/S
IMPRESSION:
1. Minimally heterogeneous liver. Echogenic portal triads.
2. Soft tissue lesion in the gallbladder fundus with
calcification.
Malignancy should be considered. This should be further
evaluated by MRCP.

MRCP [**2171-4-19**]:
Findings consistent with gallbladder adenomyomatosis
(hyperplastic
cholecystosis).

Brief Hospital Course:
# hypoxia/respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia with sepsis
- Pt with severe COPD on 2L O2 at baseline at home, now with new
O2 requirement necessitating BIPAP for 30 minutes in the ED.
Remained hemodynamically stable. H/o recurrent aspiration pna
for which a Gtube was placed previously. Current presentation of
fever, productive cough, hypoxia --> consistent w/ aspiration
PNA. Given COPD and smoking history COPD flare was also
considered. Pt was initially started on vanc/cefepime/flagyl for
pna but transitioned to levoquin/flagyl as he did not have
elevated white count and was afebrile during hospital admission.
Also, he was able to maintain stable respiratory status and
improved after 1 night of monitoring in the ICU. PE was
considered given history of PE s/p IVC filter however his [**Doctor Last Name 3012**]
score was quite low and it was not felt that this was high on
the differential. Steroids (prednisone 60mg) and nebs were
started.
At time of discharge he is feeling well with an ongoing mild
productive cough but no dyspnea or wheezing. He will continue PO
levofloxacin + metronidazole through [**2171-4-24**] (day 1 of
antibiotics was [**2171-4-17**]).  He will also continue a steroid taper
regimen of: prednisone 40mg x 3 days starting [**2171-4-21**], then 20mg
x 2 days starting [**4-24**], then 10mg x 2 days starting [**4-26**], then
off.
He has not weaned off oxygen yet and remains on 4L NC. We
anticipate that with steroid tapering and chest PT, he will wean
back to his baseline.
.
#chest pain - pt c/o sharp left sided chest pain resolved with
morphine in ED. Serial ECGs showed no evidence of changes and
serial cardiac enzymes negative x3. He had missed several doses
of home morphine for his chronic back pain while in the ED and
being transported and it was felt that he got behind on his pain
control. Possibly a pleuritic component of pain from pneumonia
but this was less likely. Chest pain resolved after pt was
re-initiated on home regimen of SL morphine with fentanyl patch.
.
# AMS - On arrival to the ICU was sleepy but arousable. ABG was
normal. After sleeping for roughly 30 minutes he was fully awake
and alert. He stated he was just tired from being up all night
not feeling well the night before. Electrolytes were within
normal limits. Some component of lethargy also attributed to the
2mg IV morphine he received for chest pain in the ED. Pt did
have asterixis on exam however and there was concern for
cirrhosis/hepatic encephalopathy, although coags and LFTs were
normal. RUQ u/s was ordered, see re gallblader mass below.
