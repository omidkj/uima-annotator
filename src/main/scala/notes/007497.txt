PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's
temperature was 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was
100 to 115, her blood pressure was 110 to 120/75 to 85, her
respiratory rate was 22, and her oxygen saturation was 92% on
6 liters face mask with an FIO2 of 0.5.  In general, the
patient was tired-appearing white female.  She spoke in
4-word to 8-word sentences.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
The sclerae were anicteric.  Conjunctivae were normal.  The
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light from 3.5 mm
to 2 mm.  The extraocular movements were intact.  No
nystagmus.  The oropharynx was clear.  Neck was tender to
passive rotation (stable finding).  There was full range of
motion.  Jugular veins were flat.  No carotid bruits.  No
thyromegaly.  Node examination revealed there was no
anterior, cervical, posterior cervical, supraventricular, or
infraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal adenopathy.
Cardiovascular examination revealed point of maximal impulse
in the fifth rib space in a midclavicular line.  The patient
was tachycardic with normal first heart sounds and second
heart sounds.  There was no third heart sound or fourth heart
sound.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The lung examination
revealed good effort with normal excursion.  There were
diffuse wheezes bilaterally.  Clear to percussion.  No
fremitus.  No egophony.  Abdominal examination revealed
scaphoid with normal bowel sounds.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  No organomegaly.  Back
examination revealed no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Vascular examination revealed carotid, radial, femoral, and
dorsalis pedis pulses were brisk and equal.  Extremity
examination revealed there was no rash, clubbing, cyanosis,
or edema.  For neurologic examination please refer to the
online medical record for detailed summary.  A normal
neurologic examination.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 10.5, her
hematocrit was 30.2, and her platelets were 282.  Chemistry-7
revealed the patient's sodium was 134, potassium was 4.4,
chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 21, blood urea nitrogen was
13, creatinine was 0.8, and her blood glucose was 124.  Her
lactate dehydrogenase was 782.  Her urinalysis was normal.
Acetaminophen level was 46.  Arterial blood gas was as
follows; pH was 7.35, PCO2 was 24, PO2 was 221, SaO2 was 97%,
and lactate was 2.8.  The patient was on the supplemental
oxygen described above at the time of this blood gas.  Iron
studies revealed iron was 20, total iron-binding capacity was
280, ferritin was 319, and transferrin was 215.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed
sinus tachycardia at 111 beats per minute.  P-R interval and
QRS interval and chamber wall normal.  The axis was zero
degrees with no R wave progression.  There was no evidence of
ischemia, injury, or infarction.

A chest x-ray revealed bilateral diffuse airspace opacities,
and there was a nodular density in the right middle lobe.

The patient had a computed tomography angiogram of the chest
which did not show a central pulmonary embolism.  There were
diffuse patchy ground-glass opacities identified on this
study.  An interval high-resolution computed tomography
angiogram of the chest confirmed these findings.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Her
course is summarized by issue/system below.

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  Infectious etiologies were initially
entertained.  The patient was placed on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin to treat a community-acquired pneumonia.  The
patient had two episodes of an elevated temperature for which
blood cultures were drawn, and those cultures were sterile.

Out of concern for her high lactate dehydrogenase, and her
diffuse ground-glass opacities on computed tomography
angiogram of the chest, the patient had an human
immunodeficiency virus test which was negative.  She had a
bronchoscopic evaluation which did not show Pneumocystis.
She was not treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

She had a urinary Legionella antigen also which came back
negative.  Influenza was also ruled out.  She required
aggressive bronchodilator therapy over the first two days of
her hospital stay.  Because she did not initially show
improvement, plans were made following the bronchoscopy for a
video-assisted thoracic surgery biopsy of the lung
parenchyma; however, by hospital five, the patient's
condition had
