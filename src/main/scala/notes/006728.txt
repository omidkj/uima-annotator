Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
DC cardioversion for atrial fibrillation


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 79yoM with pmh CAD, s/p DES to ramus and mid circ in
[**2112**], COPD, htn s/p L renal artery stent, PUD who presented on
[**2116-8-19**] to OSH with sudden onset SOB, fever, found to have
NSTEMI as well as likely pneumonia with resultant COPD
exacerbation. Pt states SOB started day of pres, occurred
acutely shortly after feeling leg cramps. Denies chest pain at
that time, states that when he did have an MI back in [**2112**], he
experienced epigastric pain. On route to OSH pt had one episode
vomitting. At the OSH pt was treated for pneumonia and
klebsiella bacteremia with Zosyn, anti-coagulated with
heparin/statin/aspirin for NSTEMI, IV solumedrol for COPD. His
clinical status was improving, was off heparin and symptom free,
stress testing was planned, however on [**2116-8-23**] pt developed
acute SS chest pain, SOB with hypoxia to 80%s on 4L NC. He was
treated with nitroglycerin, morphine, IV lasix for CHF given
clinical/cxr c/w pulmonary edema. EKG was concerning for lateral
STD v4-v6. Pt did improve temporarily but again desaturated and
required non invasive ventillation. At this point he was
restarted on heparin drip.
.
He is currently CP free and feels his breathing has improved
significantly.
.
ROS: denies cough, headache, abd pain, diarrhea, melena,
hematochezia

Imaging studies:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2116-8-24**] 1:23 AM
Mild pulmonary edema is new. Mild cardiomegaly unchanged. Left
pleural thickening is stable. No pneumothorax. Widening of the
superior mediastinum is comparable probably due to combination
of mediastinal fat and thyroid enlargement.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2116-8-24**]  12:52:42 AM
Sinus rhythm
Right bundle branch block
Inferior/lateral ST-T changes
Since previous tracing, no significant change
.
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular  chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion.

.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2116-8-28**] 7:13 AM
Lung volumes are lower than on [**8-26**], which may account in
part for intensification of perihilar edema and more pronounced
left lower lobe consolidation. Pneumonia cannot be excluded. The
heart is top normal in size, unchanged. Small left pleural
effusion persists. No pneumothorax.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2116-8-30**] 9:54 AM
Compared to the prior film, there is improved aeration and less
density in the paracentral regions suggesting some diminution in
pulmonary edema. However, there is residual airspace density and
no evidence for pleural effusion. No new focal consolidation is
seen. An area of atelectasis is noted in the frontal view
adjacent to the left heart border which is subsegmental in
nature.
.
IMPRESSION: Improving appearance of the chest with no new
consolidations.

Brief Hospital Course:
79yo M w/ diastolic heart failure, hypoxia [**12-26**] COPD exacerbation
and pneumonia, NSTEMI w/ STD v1-v4, klebsiella bacteremia,
nasopharyngeal bleed vs GI bleed, new onset a. fib s/p
cardioversion, now in NSR.
.
CARDIAC
# LV function
Pt w/ dilated heart failure p/w CHF exacerbation. Echo w/ EF
>55%, AR/MR, normal LV size. Volume overload with pulm edema,
extremities warm, BP normotensive. IV lasix switched to PO on
[**8-31**], decreased to 80 PO QD from [**Hospital1 **] on [**9-2**], decrease to 40mg
QD on [**9-5**]. Will continue with 40mg QD on d/c home.
- isosorbide, lasix 40 PO qd, lisinopril 40mg, norvasc 10mg
- fluid balance goal -500, monitor UOP, fluid restrict 1L
- Compression stockings for LE edema
- proBNP elevated on admission 15,939, on d/c 2912
.
# Ischemia
Presented w/ NSTEMI. Elevated troponins in setting of CHF,
pneumonia, possible PE, EKG changes with pain on morning of
transfer. Not candidate for cath at this time, cont medical
management. Lipid panel w/ LDL 37, HDL 47, cholesterol 107, TG
116.
- aspirin, atorvastatin 40 qd
.
# Rhythm
New onset of atrial fibrillation on [**8-25**], no hx of Afib in past.
Received amiodarone load and 18hr infusion for rhythm
conversion. PFTs [**2-/2115**] c/w COPD, mild airway obstruciton,
LFTs/TFTs wnl. ?Long QT on ECG on [**8-30**], however will allow for
some prolongation due to RBBB. Placed on heparin drip [**8-26**],
continued for 1 week. D/c'd on [**9-1**]. s/p cardioversion on [**8-27**],
now NSR. Given amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] ([**Date range (1) 51720**]), 400mg qd
(started [**Date range (1) 51721**]), switched to 200mg QD on [**9-5**] for
prolonged QT.
- Continue diltiazem SR 300mg qd, amio 200mg QD
.
PULMONARY
# Hypoxia:
Multifactorial CHF, COPD, recent PNA. Minimal hemoptysis.
- treat pulmonary edema secondary to CHF w/ diuresis
.
# COPD:
Goal o2 sat 93%, stable on RA at rest and with ambulation, lung
exam w/ persistent wheezing. RR increases with ambulation.
- continue nebs, advair, spiriva
- oral prednisone with taper, 30mg qd starting [**8-29**], 20mg QD on
[**8-31**], 10mg QD on [**9-3**]. Will send patient home on 7.5mg for one
week.
.
RENAL
# ARF:
Fe Urea was 45, so not likely pre-renal etiology. Cr elevation
may be due to bactrim.
- monitor creatinine, currently stable.
- Will need f/u Cr after discharge, off abx.
.
HEME
# Anemia:
Secondary to GI/oropharyngeal bleed vs. hemolysis, monitor
serial Hct. Haptoglobin <20, elevated LDH however may be normal
rxn in patient receiving multiple transfusions. EGD showed only
mild gastritis, no obvious source of bleed. Was given 4U over
this admission.
- Continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
.
ID
# Leukocytosis:
WBC decreasing, now afebrile. [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to C. diff vs UTI
vs steroids. C. diff negative x2. CXR wnl. UCx + for
enterococcus, yeast.
- Empiric treatment for c diff with flagyl x 14days (Day 1
[**8-30**]). Will give 14 days from date of last abx which was [**9-4**].
D/c on 2 wks flagyl.
- Completed 7 day course Bactrim for 7 days for complicated UTI
.
# Klebsiella septicemia
Blood cx NGTD.
- completed zosyn course which wa
