# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2122-3-11**] 9:49 PM
Low lung volumes, but no acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2122-3-13**] 11:22 AM
Lungs are appreciably lower, with new subsegmental atelectasis
at both bases. Upper lungs clear. Heart size normal. Lateral
view suggests severe distention of the stomach with air and
fluid.
.
# TTE [**2122-3-13**] at 4:12:35 PM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF 60%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild mitral valve prolapse. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2120-7-22**], the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
47M h/o COPD/asthma admitted with CP and SOB, likely [**1-31**] COPD
exacerbation, possibly [**1-31**] respiratory infection, transferred to
floor after refusing ICU-level care, later left AMA.
.
# SOB: Pt presented with SOB and audible wheezing, but because
pt persistently refused ABGs, was unable to evaluate extent of
respiratory compromise.  DDx includes COPD/asthma exacerbation
v. respiratory infection v. CHF.
- Question CHF: Pt was diuresed with furosemide 40mg x1 in ICU,
although he did appear clinically euvolemic, with no significant
history of systolic CHF.  Further diuresis held on the floor.
- Question COPD exacerbation: Albuterol, ipratropium,
acetylcysteine, supplemental oxygen, montelukast, tiotropium,
fluticasone/salmeterol, and levalbuterol were provided, but pt
frequently refused treatment, stating that he was concerned
about his heart.  Pt rejected BiPAP.  Pt tolerated fluticasone
INH when he accepted this treatment.  PO and IV steroids were
held [**1-31**] history of steroid psychosis.
- Question infection: Repeat CXR was clear, and pt remained
afebrile, with a normal WBC.  Given mildly elevated CK, a
possible infectious process was treated with levofloxacin 750mg
PO, the course for which he did not complete.
.
# Chest pressure: Patient reported CP upon ED presentation,
although TropT negative and no EKG changes were noted.  Echo
during this admission was unchanged from prior, with an
increased LVEF noted at 60%.  Inpatient cardiology records from
Seacreast Cardiology, Newington [**Name (NI) **] (pt's inpatient attending
cardiologists) were solicited but not received.
