Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 43313**] was admitted to the TSICU after her operation. She was
initially kept NPO and on IVFs. Her wound was closely monitored.
She did not complain of pain and felt better throughout the day.
She was given a regular diet. She was able to get out of bed to
chair. She was ready for transfer out of ICU on HD 1. However,
once on the floor, her cellulitis continued to spread. She was
taken to the OR urgently that night and had further debridement.
She was taken to the SICU after the OR, intubated and sedated.
Her cellulitis continued to spread and she was again taken to
the OR for further debridement and packed with saline gauze. On
HD 5, she was taken back to the OR. There appeared to be no
further evidence of infection and her fascia and soft tissues
appeared okay, a wound VAC x2 was placed over her abdomen &
perineal incisions. She was stable in the ICU. Her vent settings
were weaned until she was successfully extubated on [**2188-6-16**]. She
was intermittently agitated and haldol and ativan were given
prn. She went to the OR again on [**6-17**] for VAC change. She was
started on tylenol and dilaudid prn for pain control. Speech and
swallow evaluated her and she was given thin liquids, which she
tolerated. On [**6-18**] clindamycin was dc'd. Overnight, she had high
stool output, with diarrhea multiple times during the day, and
she was taken to the OR for VAC change. A rectal tube was placed
the next day and a cdiff sent, which was negative. Vancomycin
was also discontinued and a planned 3 week course of meropenem
was recommended by ID. She passed speech and swallow eval and
was continued on a regular diet, which she tolerated. She was
transferred to the floor on [**6-19**].

On the floor she remained alert and oriented. She continued on
meropenem. A PICC line was placed under fluoroscopy on [**6-23**]. Her
leukocytosis resolved and vac changes continued q3 days and as
needed in the operating room. Through each procedure, the
majority of her wounds have been surgically closed.

Her diarrhea slowed and her rectal tube was discontinued. Her
foley catheter was kept in place to avoid wound contamination.
She has been urinating without issue.  She was encouraged to
mobilize out of bed as tolerated.

On the day of discharge, Mrs.[**Known lastname 112272**] right lateral (most
superior) wound was closed at the bedside.  She is
hemodynamically stable and afebrile.  She remains with a foley
catheter, which may be discontinued once assessed at the rehab
facility.  She has been informed of her transfer to a
rehabilitation facility.  I have also instructed her on the
importance of keeping her wounds (perineal, groin area) clean
and use of miconazole powder to prevent fungal infections.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with an infection of your
fascia in your perineal area called Fournier's Gangrene. This
infection required multiple debridements in the operating room
and a wound vac dressings. You were treated with IV antibiotics
along with surgical debridment and your infection stopped.

After your surgeries, you now have multiple surgical incisions
that are closed with sutures.  It will be very important that
you keep those areas clean and dry.  Wash with soap and water in
your perineal area daily, if not twice a day, and place
Miconazole (anti-fungal) powder to those areas after cleanin
