Chief Complaint:
Asymptomatic


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement [**2196-10-28**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32296**] is a 74 year old male who was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
an aortic aneurysm that was incidently found 1 year ago. A
recent CT scan of his aorta showed his aneurysm to measure 5cm
where it was 4.8cm in [**2195-8-6**]. Given the progression of his
disease, he was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for consultation. His
review determined aorta to be 5.2 cm. he will need will need his
aneurysm repair prior to hip surgery.

Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. No
spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the RA. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. Low
normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root. Moderately dilated ascending
aorta Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic
arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. Mild to
moderate ([**2-7**]+) AR. Eccentric AR jet directed toward the
anterior mitral leaflet.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**2-7**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Pericardial calcifications.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass
data

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the mid inferior septal wall. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF =55X %). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). with
normal free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**2-7**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward
the anterior mitral leaflet.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There are pericardial calcifications.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results before
surgical incision

POST-BYPASS:
Preserved biventricular sytolic function.
Intact thoracic aortic graft.
No new valvular findings.
Mild AI.
LVEF 55%
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
