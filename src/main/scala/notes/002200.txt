Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
MEC chemotherapy followed by syngeneic transplant

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
hickman placed [**8-10**]
intubation
intra-aortic balloon pump

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 39 year old woman diagnosed with AML in [**2166-11-11**]
after presenting for a routine physical exam, CBC revealed white
count of 5300 with 40% blasts.  Pt noted generalized fatigue at
that time. Patient found to have normal cytogenetics,
immunophenotyping revealed positive CD34; positive CD13, and
positive CD17. Patient underwent induction 7+3; 5+2 in [**Month (only) 404**]
of [**2166**], followed by three cycles of consolidation after which
she had a bone marrow biopsy with remission in early [**2166**].
Patient remained in remission until [**3-31**] at which time she was
found to have relapsed by bone marrow biopsy and underwent
reinduction 7+3/5+2(idarubicin and cytarabine). Patient was
planned to have synergeneic transplant (she has a twin
sister-however this is in the process of being confirmed), with
BU/CY containing regimen.  She was admitted for a week in [**Month (only) 205**]
for neutropenic fevers, hickman was pulled, and patient was
treated with Daptomycin.  Last bone marrow biopsy on [**7-27**] shows
relapsed AML, CD34/CD13 with 26% blast cells.  CMV viral load on
[**7-27**] was + at 36.
.
Although her English is limited, patient states that she has
been feeling relatively well since her discharge.  Uses ativan
to help control her nausea, has had occasional diarrhea with the
most recent episode this am, denies any blood in stool.  She
reports feeling tired most of the time, but her appetite and
weight have been stable (she initially lost 5-10lbs after
chemo).  She denies any fever/chills or night sweats.  She notes
trouble sleeping, which often results in a headache the
following morning.  She also reports some chest/substernal
"discomfort"-particularly in the am, but denies pain or SOB.
Patient notes increased anxiety with this hospitalization.

Imaging:
[**11-18**] PCXR: An endotracheal tube ends in satisfactory position 4
cm above the carina. An NG tube curls in the stomach. A
Swan-Ganz catheter from the inferior approach ends in the
proximal left pulmonary artery. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
A small left effusion is stable. Opacity within the left lower
lobe and the peripheral right lung base is unchanged. No failure
or pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: Lines and tubes in satisfactory position. Opacity in
the left lower lobe and the right lateral lung base representing
possible pneumonia Vs. atelectasis are unchanged compared to
[**2168-11-17**].

[**11-11**] Cath: FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Cardiogenic [**Month/Year (2) **] with vasodilatory [**Month/Year (2) **]
2. IABP insertion.
.
[**11-13**] RUQ US: There is a large right-sided pleural effusion.
Gallbladder is not distended. There is gallbladder wall
thickening. No gallstones are seen. There is possible sludge
within the gallbladder. There is no intra- or extra- hepatic
biliary ductal dilatation. Common duct measures 3-4 mm. Portal
vein appears patent on limited imaging.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right-sided pleural effusion.
2. Gallbladder wall thickening without gallstones identified.
The appearance of the gallbladder is not significantly changed
compared to the exam of seven days prior. Causes of gallbladder
wall thickening include hypoalbuminemia, CHF, liver disease, and
other causes of third spacing. If there is continued clinical
concern for acalculous cholecystitis, HIDA scan may be performed
for further evaluation.


Brief Hospital Course:
39 year old female with relapsed AML, admitted for re-induction
followed by syngeneic/identical twin allogenic transplant.
Patient had been on BMT service for >2 months and was then
transferred to the MICU for CHF, including diuresis and
afterload reduction therapy initially with hydralazine changed
to ACE I (captopril). With these interventions, patient's weight
decreased from 130 -> 114 lbs. Course was c/b intermittent
episodes of hypotension (below baseline hypotension of SBP 80's
- 100's) and lightheadedness. Following stablization after
weight loss and transfer to the floor, patient had orthostasis,
continued total body edema and continued to complain of dry
mouth. Her cardiac managment is otherwise complicated by
continuous sinus tachycardia to 120-140's.

Patient was then transferred from the floor to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for
management of heart failure and diuresis. She diuresed well over
2 weeks however was still fluid overloaded. Patient underwent a
trial of nesiritide for diuresis while off captopril and then
lasix was added the regimen. On [**11-7**], patient diuresed well on
lasix with a slight elevation in creatinine to 1.6, but a new
anion gap was noted with a lactate of 7. Also, LFT's increased
without clear cause. On [**11-10**], patient become hypotensive to
60's overnight with worsening respiratory distress. Unclear
whether this was due to sepsis versus cardiogenic [**Month/Year (2) **].

Patient was subsequently transferred to the CCU and intubated
due to r
