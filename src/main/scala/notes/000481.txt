Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
42 yo with DM II and HTN who presents with 2 days of abdominal
pain. THe patient reports that on Wednesday after eating a
[**Last Name (un) **] he developed abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea. He states that the abdominal pain is located
predominantly in the LLQ, was mostly crampy and intermittently
sharp in character, non-radiating. Over the next two days the
pain got progressivley worsening abdominal pain. He was only
able to take minimal po intake. Nothing appeared to make the
pain worse or better. He does not recall any aspiration however
he noted his breathing started to became more laboured on
Thursday. He reports mild pleuritic chest pain associated with
deep breaths, non positional. He also noted a fever for the
first time on Friday as well as worsening respiratory
secretions. Because of the worsening respiratory status and his
abdominal pain he decided to go to the [**Location (un) 620**] [**Hospital1 **] on Friday.
There he was found to have an elevated WBC, Lipase and Amylase
and a CT abdomen was consisted with pancreatitis. The patient
was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care after receiving 2L NS,
levofloxacin and Flagyl.
.
ED course: On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED the patient was
tachycardic to 136, febrile to 101, normotensive to 129/79 with
a RR of 19 and O2sat of 80RA. THe patient was started on O2 by
nasal canula which was uptitrated over the next hours ultimately
requiring a NRB. The patient was given a total of 5L of NS as
fluid resuscitation. A CTA was done as well as a CT abdomen and
pelvis which was negative for PE, but comfirmed a b/l lower lobe
pneumonia and acute pancreatitis without necrosis. He was given
Levofloxacin and Dilaudid 4mg for pain and Lorazepam 2mg iv for
anxiety.
.
On admission to the ICU the patient complaint of LLQ pain, [**4-7**],
non-radiating. He confirmed respiratory distress but rated that
stable over the last several hours. He denied any nausea
currently and did not have any further diarrhea. Pt denies any
recent travel, excessive ETOH or yellow discoloration of skin.
pt reports recent food excess during attendance of a symposium.
.
ROS: negative for rash, dysuria, changes in the color of the
urine or stool.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: SR, tachycardia, rate 120, NA, NI, no ST or TW changes
.
CTA/ CT abdomen: [**2174-7-22**]
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Bilateral lower lobe airspace consolidation, likely
pneumonia, with small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Acute pancreatitis, without evidence of acute complication.
4. Fatty liver.
5. Bilateral renal hypodensities, likely small cysts

US liver - FINDINGS: The bedside ultrasound examination is
markedly limited by patient body habitus, and inability to
cooperate due to pain and respiratory distress. Limited images
of the liver demonstrate increased echogenicity, likely
representing fatty liver. Gallbladder was unable to be
identified.

IMPRESSION:

Markedly limited portable study. Nonvisualization of the
gallbladder. Echogenic liver.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: Evaluate for pseudocyst formation, abscess, or interval
[**Doctor Last Name **]

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
42 year old man with pancreatitis and rising WBC, and SOB with
tachycardia.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate for pseudocyst formation, abscess, or interval change
in pancreatitis. R/o PE for persistent tachycardia and SOB.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 30-year-old man with pancreatitis and shortness of
breath.

Comparison is made to the CTA of the chest performed on [**7-22**], [**2173**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained from thoracic inlet
to pubic symphysis. The CTA of the chest was performed based on
pulmonary embolism protocol; nontheless, there is suboptimal
contrast timing for assessing pulmonary embolism. The CT of the
abdomen and pelvis portion is performed with CTE protocol. Two
separate injections of contrast were administered, with the
chest covered with both injections.

CT OF CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The heart and great
vessels appear unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged hilar,
mediastinal or axillary nodes are noted. Severe degree of
atelectatic changes is noted within the anterior [**Doctor First Name **] segment
of right lower lobe and base of the right middle lobe. Moderate
degree of atelectasis is also noted at the left lung base. Given
the presence of air bronchograms particularly at the left lower
lobe, there is likely superimposed consolidation. Trace
bilateral pleural effusion is seen, which is more prominent on
the left side.

Although the pulmonary artery contrast bolus appears suboptimal
(probably due to patient habitus and slower injection rate due
to IV size) on both scans of the chest, there is no evidence of
pulmonary embolus within the limits of the study.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The pre-pancreatic
fluid/phlegmon in the anterior pararenal space appears slightly
larger, especially inferiorly-- there is increased fluid along
the left lateroconal fascia. A small amount of fluid now tracks
down the left anterior pararenal space to the pelvis. A trace of
fluid is also seen within the right anterior pararenal space.
The pancreas enhances homogeneously and there is no site of
necrosis. No definite fluid collection is shown in the pancreas.
No loculated pseudoaneurysm is visualized. No evidence of SMV or
portal vein thrombosis.

There is hepatic steatosis. A 1.8 cm hypodense structure is
again noted within the dome of the liver, with fluid density
likely representing a cyst. Small amount of ascitic fluid has
developed adjacent to the liver and spleen. The gallbladder and
intra- and extra- hepatic bile ducts are unremarkable. This
spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys have normal appearance. No
pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric node is
noted. No free air is noted within the abdomen.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum has a normal
appearance. The sigmoid colon contains multiple diverticula,
with no evidence of diverticulitis. The urinary bladder and
distal ureters appear unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged
pelvic or inguinal nodes are visualized. No free air is noted
within the pelvis. As noted above, a small amount of fluid
tracks into the pelvis.

BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. Overall similar appearance of peripancreatic inflammation;
however, anterior pararenal fluid and phlegmon is minimally
increased. No pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst, or abscess is
visualized.

2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

3. Atelectatic with superimposed consolidation at both lung
bases.

4. Small amount of ascites is noted within the abdomen and
pelvis.

5. Small hypodense lesion of the dome of the liver, which are
too small to characterize, likely a cyst.
