Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
84 yo M c significant h/o CAD, atrial fibrillation, s/p
pacemaker placement for Sick Sinus Syndrome with recent
admission in [**Month (only) **] for STEMI found to have increasing SOB and
tachypnea at Rehab hospital. He was admitted in [**Month (only) **] for
STEMI after bilateral knee replacement.  Catherization at that
time showed 100% proximal stent restenosis, diffuse RCA disease,
and a patent Left Circumflex stent. A PTCA [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was
successfully placed in LAD.  The catherization was complicated
by the development of wide complex tachycardia and hypotension
(SBP 80s).  As a result, the patient was defibrillated once,
given IV lopressor, IV Amiodarone,
Dopamine pressor, an Intraaortic Balloon Pump, and intubated to
protect airway.  He was treated in the CCU, stabilized, and
discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab.  There he was doing well until he
developed a PNA, found to have RLL infiltrate on CXR. He was
started on Cefuroxime.  He had increasing SOB over several days,
on [**2198-12-14**] had increased SOB and was given Lasix and Ativan.  He
had no chest pain, N/V.  He was found down at rehab and then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.  In the ED he was found
to have severe CHF with complicating PNA, he was sent to the CCU
for further care.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Prominent right
paratracheal lymph node is present. This is non-pathologically
enlarged by CT criteria and is most likely reactive. There are
dense multifocal coronary artery calcifications as well as
cardiac enlargement. Previously evident small pericardial
effusion has slightly decreased in size since the prior study.
Assessment of lung fields again demonstrates findings of
congestive heart failure, with evidence of ground-glass
opacities and smooth thickening of septal lines. Small to
moderate bilateral pleural effusions slightly increased in size
in the interval. There has been development of areas of
organizing fibrosis peripherally with associated bronchiectasis
and bronchiolectasis. The airways are patent to the level of the
subsegmental bronchi bilaterally.  Imaged portions of the upper
abdomen are notable for vascular calcifications and a left renal
cyst.  IMPRESSION:
1) Cardiomegaly, coronary artery calcifications, and evidence of
congestive heart failure as above, with persistent ground-glass
opacities, smooth thickening of septal lines, and small to
moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
This process appears to be superimposed upon underlying ARDS as
described below
2) Progressive development of areas of organizing fibrosis along
the periphery of both lungs. The appearance is consistent with a
history of ARDS with an element of organizing fibrosis.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2198-12-21**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. A
catheter or pacing
wire is seen in the RA and/or RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Top [**Doctor First Name **]/borderline dilated
LV cavity
size.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
mid anterior -
akinetic; mid anteroseptal - akinetic; basal inferior - hypo;
basal
inferolateral - hypo; anterior apex - akinetic; septal apex-
akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic root.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate ([**2-10**]+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate
[[**2-10**]+] TR. Moderate PA systolic [**Month/Day (2) **].

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic
signs of
tamponade.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. Resting regional
wall motion
abnormalities include anteroseptal, anterior and apical
hypokinesis and basal
inferior and inferolateral hypokinesi
