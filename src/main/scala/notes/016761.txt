Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13541**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital **] Rehab w/ SVC syndrome for planned IR
intervention


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible bronchoscopy
Pleurocentesis

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 y/o man, long-time smoker, recently diagnosed
w/ SCC of lung w/ SVC syndrome, who presents for scheduled SVC
recannalization w/ IR.

The patient was diagnosed w/ SCC in [**11-22**] at NWH, when he
presented w/ SVC syndrome. CT chest revealed large R lung mass
which is 6cm in maximal dimension & paratracheal/RUL/RML in
location. The mass encases the patient's SVC. (CT chest also
showed R main pulm artery narrowed by mass and R pleural
effusion). The pt underwent bronchoscopy [**2162-12-1**], lesions in
right and left lobe biopsied & established dx of SCC. Head MRI
[**2162-12-2**] reportedly negative for mets. He was started on chemotx
(Decadron, Taxotere, & Cisplatin) on [**2162-12-29**] plus radiation. He
subsequently developed worsening SOB & on [**2163-1-4**] was admitted
to ICU at NWH w/ post-obstructive PNA (sputum grew MRSA &
Acinetobacter Baumannii, which was tx'd w/ tigecycline &
doxycycline). He underwent R sided thoracentesis, results not
available in paperwork w/ pt. He also had a bronchscopy, which
showed significant airway edema above the vocal cords & complete
obstruction of R bronchial tree due to edema & extrinsic
compression. He was started on steroids for airway edema. In the
setting of steroids, he was noted to have elevated Bld glucose &
was started on Lantus & ISS. He had a bout of pre-renal [**Last Name (un) **] w/
crt peaking at 2.4 (BL reportedly 1.6-1.7). Echo done showed EF
>65% w/ mild concentric LVH. Bilateral LENIs (done b/c of edema)
were negative for thrombus as was RUE u/s. Pt was discharged to
[**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] on [**2163-1-14**].

During rehab stay at [**Name (NI) **], pt noted increasing swelling of
b/l arms, neck, face, & LEs. Pt also occasionally c/o SOB. (Of
note, he has been on 02 via NC over the last month--likely b/c
of CA, underlying COPD & pl effusion. He is currently requiring
2-3L O2 by NC.) He has been noted to have declining counts in
all cell lines: WBC 2.8, plt 77, Hct 23 on [**2163-1-25**]. Per email
from Dr. [**Name (NI) **], who spoke w/ MD at rehab, the pt's
primary oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23509**], does not think drop in cell
counts is secondary to chemo at this point, and reportedly
thought bone marrow suppression might be cause. ASA & Fragmin
(DVT ppx) were stopped due to the thrombocytopenia. There were
repotedly no signs of acute bleeding. Pt transfused 2 units
PRBCs [**2163-1-25**] last night. He has reportedly had periods of
hypernatremia (as high as 152 per notes). Additionally, his
prednisone taper (for airway edema) ended [**2162-12-25**]; however, on
[**2162-12-27**] he was given a dose of 40mg prednisone for unclear
reasons. It appears that he has had persistent sinus
tachycardia, possibly [**1-17**] decreased cardiac filling from SVC
syndrome. His last chemo was [**12-29**] & XRT was [**12-31**].

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] wards, pt is w/o complaints. He says he is
not SOB, unless he exerts himself. He gets SOB w/ ambulating a
few feet. He denies all pain, including CP.

ROS: He endorses occas cough. Denies fever, chills, night
sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, sore throat, chest
pain, hemoptysis, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

[**2-1**] pleural fluid cytology:  ATYPICAL.
  Rare atypical epithelioid cells in a background of
  lymphocytes and macrophages; cannot exclude involvement by
  carcinoma.

CXR [**1-30**]:  Compared to the film from earlier the same day, there
is some new hazy opacity at the right heart border that could
represent small area of infiltrate, volume loss. Otherwise,
there is no change.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo man w/ SVC syndrome due to malignant compression of SVC
and continued respiratory distress.

# Respiratory distress: Pt stable while at rest, with
considerable SOB with movement.  Likely due to R-sided pleural
effusion, known emphysema, RUL mass, as well as airway edema.
Therapeutic thoracentesis performed on [**1-28**].  Flex bronch on
[**1-28**] demonstrated considerable airway obstruction with no
possibility for endobronchial stent placement, as well as a
posterior wall defect in the right bronchus intermedius.  He was
treated symptomatically with Spiriva and Atrovent nebulizers,
steroids, as well as low-dose morphine PRN to decrease air
hunger.  He was evaluated by IR for possible SVC stent placement
as a palliative measure for his respiratory distress, however
given his respiratory distress and inability to lie flat, a
stent was not attempted.

# Neutropenic fever/hospital-acquired PNA: Pt developed fever to
104 with sBPs in 70s and HR 150s. He was given 2L bolus of NS,
Tylenol, Vanc & Cefepime for neutropenic fever. He was then
noted to develop worsening tachypnea and increased oxygen
requirement. Pt was rigorring mildly on the floor when an EKG
was obtained he appeared to be in sinus tach. ABG revealed
7.45/36/109. Pt was transferred to ICU, where CXR ([**1-30**])
revealed some ne
