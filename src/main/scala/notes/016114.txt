Chief Complaint:
VT arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation


History of Present Illness:
62 yo male w/ PMHx significant for HTN, hypercholesterolemia,
DM, CRI, and prior V-fib arrest, presented to the ER w/ sob and
cough.  He has been well until yesterday evening when he had a
cough.  Overnight the patient had an episode on non-bloody
emesis.  Today the patient experienced sob and chills and was
[**Last Name (un) 4662**] to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER.

In triage, the patient had an O2 sat of 68% and a RR of 48.  He
was brought to an ER room and became unresponsive.  He was
bradycardic to the 20's without a pulse.  He was given
epinephrine and chest compressions were started.  The patient
went into a junctional rhythm without a pulse and was given
atropine and intubated shortly thereafter.  A pulse was briefly
regained and then the patient went pulseless again, went into
VT.  Pt was shocked at 200 joules and the pulse was regained.
Amiodarone 300 mg IV push was given.  The patient then entered
sinus rhythm after ~ 5 minutes.

The following day, the patient became febrile to 102.5 and was
pan cultured. Simultaneously, he became less responsive and
rigid, without gag or corneal reflex and sluggish pupils
bilaterally.

Past Medical History:
HTN
Diabetes
Vfib arrest [**2-16**]

Pertinent Results:

ASD, mild LVH, depressed LV systolic function.
Septal/inferolateral/inferior hypokinesis.  Aortic root
moderately dilated.  Ascending aorta moderately dilated.  Mild
AR, mild MR, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**2106-2-25**] cardiac cathterization - RCA dominant vessel.  PCWP 25
LVEDP 24  CI 2.7  EF 56%  LAD 30% leison, D3 80% stenosis, large
intermedius branch 40% ostial lesion, LCx 40% proximal 70%
distal after OM1.  OM1 50% tubular stenotic lesion.

CXR - b/l pulmonary edema

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo male w/ PMHx significant for HTN, hypercholesterolemia,
DM, CRI, and prior V-fib arrest
.
CV - cardiac arrest likely precipitated hypoxia/acidosis.  Pt
has a wide QRS at baseline, some of wide complex tachycardia may
not be VT.
.
CAD - His ASA/Statin/ were continued but BB was held since
patient was bradycardic on amiodarone
.
[**Name (NI) **] - Pt in mild failure by CXR.  Unclear if this was from
tachycardia or preceded admission.  He is on lasix and home.  He
was diuresed based on clincial exam and CXR.
.
Rhythm - He remained in NSR, initially on amio gtt.  Pt
persistently bradycardic overnight.  Event may have been
precipitated by hypoxia.
.
Hypoxia - infection vs CHF.  He was initially treated with
[**Doctor Last Name **]/levo/flagyl.
.
Diabetes - Mr. [**Known lastname 26178**] was placed on an insulin gtt.

Neuro: Mr. [**Known lastname 26178**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] no cranial nerve function,
although he was not apneic. He remained unresponsive and despite
the fact that no sedatives were used on him. After several long
conversations with MR. [**Known lastname 26178**]' children and wife regarding his
poor prognosis, he was made CMO. He was extubated and expired
within hours.
