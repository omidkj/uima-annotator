Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old man with
multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease
on hemodialysis, previous hypertension, atrial fibrillation,
peptic ulcer disease, recently status post left below the
knee amputation from [**4-27**] and discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-1**], and was transferred to rehab.

He returned to us on [**5-1**] because of increased shortness of
breath and hypoxia, and was slightly obtunded.  The patient
had dialysis on [**5-1**] and he was initially sating 96% on 2
liters.  In the Emergency Department, he was given a dose of
ceftriaxone and Levaquin for a pneumonia and left pleural
effusion that was drained 800 cc of fluid.
Postthoracentesis, his saturations went up to 96-97%.  He did
have a small pneumothorax as a complication of this
procedure.  However, then his oxygen saturations fluctuated
in the low 90s.  His blood pressure transiently dropped to
systolic blood pressure 75, which responded to fluid boluses.

In the Emergency Department, it was discussed with Renal,
there was no need to dialyze at that time.  He was evaluated
by Surgery for his left below the knee amputation which
appeared to be healing well as per Surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, Tuesdays,
Thursdays, Saturdays.
2. Hypertension.
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Peptic ulcer disease.
5. Abdominal aortic aneurysm which is 4.3 cm in [**2108**].
6. Benign prostatic hypertrophy with prostate cancer.
7. Cerebrovascular accident.
8. Peripheral vascular disease.
9. Left below the knee amputation.
10. History of MSSA line sepsis.
11. Gastritis.
12. Esophagitis.
13. Right inguinal hernia.
14. Gastrointestinal bleed in [**2111-6-5**].
15. Chronic lower back pain.
16. Previous admissions for persistent left lower lobe
retrocardiac pneumonia.  CT scan in the past had shown a
mass.  The patient on a previous admission had refused
bronchoscopy, therefore the question of whether this
postobstructive pneumonia was never worked up.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Amiodarone 200 mg q day.
2. Nephrocaps one cap q day.
3. Renagel of 800 mg tid.
4. Protonix 40 mg q day.
5. Colace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].
6. Coumadin 1 mg q day.
7. Lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
8. Senna.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a two pack per day smoker for 65
years, occasional alcohol use.  He is a retired iron worker
and lives alone.

EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  His temperature was 99.2, blood
pressure 102/45, heart rate 83, respiratory rate 18, and
sating at 91% on 4 liters.  In general, he was awake.  His
HEENT:  Pupils are equal and reactive, but were about 1 mm
bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Dry mucous
membranes.  Chest:  He had decreased breath sounds on the
left with coarse breath sounds on the right.  Cardiac:
Regular, rate, and rhythm with a systolic murmur, distant
heart sounds.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds.  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Left below the knee
amputation, tender stump bandage, right leg showed no edema
with poor toenail care.  Neurologic:  Mental status:  He was
awake and talks.  Alert to person and [**Hospital1 **],
and was speaking nonsense at times.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Sodium of 140, potassium 5.9,
chloride 104, bicarb 21, BUN 38, creatinine 6.5, glucose 72,
nonhemolyzed specimen.  His white count was 9.4, hematocrit
of 33.5, platelets of 200, 83% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes.
His INR was 1.5 with a PT of 14.8 and a PTT of 24.6.  CK of
4,006, CK MB of 17, MBI was 0.4 and troponin of 1.  His
pleural fluid showed protein 2.3, glucose 92, LDH 84, albumin
of 1.3.  His blood cultures were drawn.

Electrocardiogram showed a junctional rhythm with
questionable ST depressions in V3 through V6, but appears
older consistent with electrocardiogram on [**2113-4-19**].  Regular
rate at 86 with some low voltages.

Chest x-ray showed progression of a left pleural effusion,
with partial layering and the right pleural effusion appeared
to be stable.

The patient was initially admitted to the MICU from [**5-1**] to
[**5-3**].

1. Pulmonary:  The patient presented with shortness of breath
and hypoxia.  Chest x-ray showed a large left pleural
effusion which was much increased from his previous chest
x-ray.  His left effusion was tapped in the Emergency Room.
His sats have been maintaining in the low 90s on a
nonrebreather, given that the probability of a pneumonia and
intermittent hypertension.  Blood cultures were sent.  This
was thought to be sepsis from a pneumonia.  He was started on
ceftriaxone and Levaquin.

His antibiotics were then changed to ceftazidime and was
continued on Vancomycin, since he had previously been on this
for colonization by MRSA in his toes.  Eventually his sputum
cultures did grow out Staph coag positive species, and his
ceftazidime was then switched over to levofloxacin and Flagyl
po on [**2113-5-4**].

The possibility of pulmonary embolus was considered given his
hypotension, his acute respiratory decompensation and
increased left pleural effusion, however, the patient has
since refused CTA.  Patient's saturations over the course of
the hospitalization has remained approximately 94-95% on the
Medical floor when he was transferred on [**2113-5-4**].

2. Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation, hypertension, and abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Given his new hypotension, his blood pressure medications
were held (his beta blocker was held).  He was continued on
amiodarone and was kept in regular rhythm.  His
anticoagulation he had been subtherapeutic as per records on
his last admission, and had not been anticoagulated.  He was
refusing Heparin drip as well because he was refusing blood
draws, and understood the risks and benefits of not being on
Heparin and was restarted on Coumadin in hospital.

His blood pressure has remained in the 85-100 range,
tolerating ................ greater than 55.

His last issue was his elevated CK MB and troponin.  His
elevated CK was thought to be secondary to his below the knee
amputation since his MB index was low thought to be secondary
to his renal failure.  His enzymes were cycled and remained
stable.  His CK continued to fall.

3. Renal:  Patient with end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis.  He continued on hemodialysis on Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays.  He had some degree of
rhabdomyolysis, and the Renal team did not feel that there
was any urgent need for dialysis initially.  He was continued
on Nephrocaps and Renagel.

4. GI:  Given his history of peptic ulcer disease and
gastrointestinal bleed, he was given Protonix.  His
hematocrit had remained stable throughout hospitalization,
and his vascular surgery had been following him for his left
below the knee amputation.  He is stable from that standpoint
and has been having dressing changes as needed.  He has a
multipodas boot on the right foot that should be continued
given his tenderness on the right heel.

His code status was changed in the hospital from full code
from DNR/DNI.  The patient has been refusing blood draws and
understands the risks of refusing both the CTA of the chest
and refusing blood draws.
