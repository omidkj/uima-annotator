Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Quinine / Sulfonamides

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 317**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right hip replacement [**2106-2-24**]
intubation
hemodialysis
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84 year-old female with a history of CHF (EF
20-25% in [**11-28**]), CAD (s/p CABG '[**81**]( SVG->LAD) with multiple
stents most recent NSTEMI in [**11-28**]), HOCM and severe MR who was
originally admitted to the orthopedic service on [**2106-2-24**] for
removal of a sliding screw and plate, removal of the femoral
head and neck and reconstructive bipolar hemiarthroplasty on
[**2106-2-24**].  In short, the patient had bilateral hip fractures in
[**2103**] and is s/p repair complicated by CHF exacerbation. She has
since had persistent right hip pain, and was walker- dependent.
The patient received 2900 cc IVF intraoperatively and lost 750
cc of blood and was transfused 1 unit PRBC. She received 2 mg
morphine x 5 in PACU for hip pain. She developed an episode of
shortness of breath in the PACU where her O2 saturation dropped
to 80% and was placed on 3 liters of O2, then saturating 97%.
Her CXR showed no evidence of CHF or infiltrate. Hours later,
her systolic blood pressure dropped to 75/40 and she was started
on neosynephrine which was subsequently switched to levophed.
The patient then received one  250 cc bolus of NS and then
another 250 cc 1/2 NS with an increase in her SBP to  90s-100.
She was given another bolus of 250 cc NS and her SBP was stable
at 101 on levophed which was subsequently weaned off. Her
hypotension as felt to be secondary to dehydration given her
volume loss. She lost an additional 350 cc blood in her hemovac.
 She was transferred to the CCU from the PACU for further care.
In the CCU, the pt. was observed overnight and her cardiac
enzymes were cycled.

On transfer, the patient offered no complaints.  She is
concerned over her low blood pressure.  She also complained of
residual "numbness" over her right hip.  She denied fever,
chills, cough, N/V/D, chest pain, shortness of breath. She r/o
for MI. 24 hrs later she was transfered to MICU for hypotension
on the medical floor. During transfer she had a respiratory
arrest requiring intubation. She suffered a inferiolateral
NSTEMI and underwent cath [**2-27**] with LCX taxus stent to LCX
instent restenosis. She was re-admitted to the CCU post cath.
The EKG showed LBBB. The echocardiogram showed new akinesis of
in the posterolateral wall.

EKG: NSR at 84bpm, LBBB (old)

PA and lateral radiographs of the chest. The previously
identified congestive heart failure has been slightly improving.
This continued mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly
and bilateral pleural effusions. There is continued bibasilar
patchy atelectasis.

Echo: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 20% to 25% (nl >=55%)
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed with EF 20-25%. Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include mid and apical
septal, anterior, lateral and inferolateral akinesis. The
remaining left ventricular segments are hypokinetic.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally mildly
thickened with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. 5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
7. The aorta was not well seen.
Compared to the previous study of [**2105-9-30**], the mid and basal
portion of the inferolateral wall which had been previously
normal is now akinetic in the mid portion and hypokinetic at the
base.

Cardiac catheterization results:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system and two vessel CAD. The LMCA was diffusely diseased
without flow limiting stenoses. The LAD was proximally occluded
and filled retrogradely via the SVG-LAD. The LCX was proximally
diffusely diseased. There was a 90%
stenosis just proximally to the recent stent as well as a 60%
in-stent
stenosis. The RCA was diffusely diseased without flow limiting
stenoses
angiographically.
2. Selective vein graft angiography showed a patent SCG-LAD with
a 30%
in-stent stenosis.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics showed a normal cardiac output
and index
(CO 4.3 l/min, CI 3.1 l/min/m2) obtained on Dopamine.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the LCX with a 3.0 x 28 mm
Taxus DES.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no apparent
dissection,
and normal flow (see PTCA comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. LCX in-stent restenosis treated with placement of a
drug-eluting
stent.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 84 year old female with an extensive cardiac
history who developed hypotension post-operatively (S/P right
hip hemiarthroplasty) li
