Imaging:
*MRI brain: 1. No abnormal restricted diffusion to suggest acute
ischemia. 2. Major intracranial vessels patent.
3. No acute intracranial process.  4. Right maxillary mucus
retention cyst.
*CT HEAD: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect or
midline shift seen. The ventricles are slightly small in size
which could be related to patient's age but mild brain edema
could not be excluded. MRI can help for further assessment. The
basal cisterns are patent. There is no herniation seen.
Intubation is visualized.
*CT ANGIOGRAPHY NECK AND HEAD: CT angiography of the head and
neck demonstrates normal flow in the carotid and vertebral
arteries without stenosis, occlusion, dissection or evidence of
extravasation of contrast.  Vascular structures of the thoracic
inlet are well maintained.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred from OSH after being intubated for
airway protection status post hanging attempt and seizure-like
activity/posturing en route to OSH. She had a CT head and neck
demonstrating no fractures and a CTA head/neck with bilateral
carotids and vertebral's patent. An MRI head/brain showed no
abnormal restricted diffusion to suggest acute ischemia. She was
admitted to the TSICU and was kept intubated overnight. On HD2
patient was extubated, initially requiring Precedex for
sedation, and this was weaned off. She demonstrated no evidence
of pneumonia on her chest xray and remained afebrile throughout
her ICU stay. Her leukocytosis at presentation is the result of
a reaction to trauma.  Preliminary MRSA testing was negative,
final results pending.

Her cervical spine was cleared once she was awake and able to
give a reliable exam.

She was evaluated by Psychiatry and was maintained on a 1:1
sitter throughout her admission. Standing Valium 10 mg daily was
started per Psychiatry. She is being recommended for inpatient
psych admission.

She was also seen by Social work for coping and emotional
support surrounding her trauma.
