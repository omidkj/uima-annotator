Chief Complaint:
pancreatitis, diverticulitis

None


History of Present Illness:
60 yom with HLD, history of ETOH use admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for
epigastric pain on [**9-3**], found to have pancreatitis by imaging
and labs.  Initial labs at [**Hospital1 **] was notable for WBC of 16, hct
of 43, plt of 265, ALT/AST of 133/217, lipase of > 1000.  Prior
to transfer, labs were notable for a wbc of 20 (11% band),
downward trending LFTs.  CT/MRCP were performed at OSH - CT
showed pancreatitis and mild sigmoid diverticulitis.  MRCP
showed 2-3mm nonobstructing intrapancreatic common bile duct
filling defect(approx 1.8cm proximal to the ampulla).  EGD was
performed, showing gastroparesis with ? ileus secondary to
panreatitis, no other lesions, noted pancreatitis.  Clinically,
he had worsening pain control and require PCA and MICU admission
at [**Hospital1 **].  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.
.
On the floor, he appeared mild-moderate distress.  Report no
bm/passing gas for the past few days.

RUQ U/S:
1. Nodular irregularity of the gallbladder wall, incompletely
evaluated. No mobile shadowing stones are identified. If the
patient has not been fasting, repeat ultrasound after fasting
may be obtained, otherwise further evaluation with MRI to
exclude polyposis or potential gallbladder malignancy is
recommended.

2. Echogenic liver compatible with fatty deposition. Other forms
of liver
disease, including significant hepatic cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot
be excluded on this examination.

3. Extrahepatic CBD cannot be reliably identified. There is
suggestion of
central biliary dilation.

CTPA:
1. PE involving the right lower lobe branch of the pulmonary
artery without evidence right heart strain.
2. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions with compressive
atelectasis.
3. Small right upper lobe opacity - inflammatory versus
infectious etiologies may be considered.

MRCP:
1. No significant change in pancreatic edema due to known
pancreatitis.
Small acute fluid collections surrounding the pancreatic body
and tail have increased from [**2144-9-5**]. No necrosis.
2. No wall nodularity or obvious filling defect in the
gallbladder.
3. Tapering of the common bile duct as it enters the pancreatic
head is
likely secondary to edema, with minimal central ductal
dilatation. No
peripheral intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
4. Fullness of the left renal collecting system is unchanged
from [**2144-9-3**].

CXR ([**9-10**]):
SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Lung volumes are diminished.
Within  this limitation, there is no new focal consolidation.
There is no large pleural effusion although probable small left
pleural effusion is present. There is no pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to prior. Vascular
congestion has decreased. Right-sided PICC follows normal course
terminating in the lower SVC.


Brief Hospital Course:
60 yom with HLD, history of ETOH use admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for
epigastric pain on [**9-3**], found to have pancreatitis by imaging
and labs, transferred for ERCP.
.
# Pancreatitis: Etiology likely due to ETOH due to history and
lack of other causes.  Initially at [**Hospital1 **] had lipase >1000 and
a CT scan with evidence of pancreatic edema and fat stranding.
MRCP showed no CBD dilation or filling defect to suggest stone.
RUQ U/S without evidence of stone although the study was poor
due to body habitus.  Triglycerides normal.  Not on medications
that can cause pancreatitis.  Did not undergo ERCP in house as
his LFTs normalized at admission and imaging did not suggest a
retained stone.  Was treated symptomatically with dilaudid for
pain control originally requiring a PCA and eventually being
weaned to minimal narcotics.  There was also an ileus due to
likely a combination of pancreatitis and narcotics; he began
stooling after transfer from the MICU.  Imaging did not show
evidence of necrosis.  He began taking clears on day 9 without
pain, and was advanced to full diet without pain by the time of
discharge.  He was counseled reg
