On morning of admit, she woke up with abdominal discomfort
and feeling anxious.  The pain was diffuse with no radiation,
no chest pain, shortness of breath.  Positive nausea, but no
vomiting.  She attributed her symptoms to depression.

On electrocardiogram she had T wave inversion in leads V2

inch Nitropatch and hydralazine 10 mg intravenous.  Her
hematocrit was 29.1.  Baseline is 30 and she had three
melanotic stools that were guaiac positive.  Nasogastric
lavage was not successful, periprocedure Ativan 2 mg made her
delirious and drowsy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, congestive heart
failure, ejection fraction 45-50%, history of
gastrointestinal bleed.  Hospitalized from [**7-25**] through
[**7-28**] for hematocrit of 20, received two units of packed red
blood cells.

At [**Hospital3 7**], esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed mild
gastritis.  Colonoscopy showed polyps. Osteoporosis, status post
right hip fracture, depression with inpatient stay at [**Hospital6 18075**] Geriatric Psychiatry unit from [**8-29**] through
[**9-6**], noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, urinary
incontinence, status post appendectomy and cholecystectomy.
Guaiac positive stools for two years.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Hospital3 **]
facility.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.  Pulse 92.
Respiratory rate 20.  Blood pressure 140/92.  02 saturation
95% on room air.  General appearance:  Frail elderly woman,
hard of hearing, alert and oriented times three.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Extraocular movements intact, pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation,
mucous membranes moist, anicteric sclera, impaired hearing
bilaterally, no jugular venous distention, no LAD.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, [**2-27**]
holosystolic murmur heard loudest at the apex left sternal
border.  Pulmonary:  Scattered expiratory wheezes, otherwise
clear to auscultation.  Abdomen:  Nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  1+ pitting edema up to
mid calf.  Neurological:  Somnolent but arousable.  Cranial
nerves II through XII are intact.  No sensory deficits
bilaterally.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 5.7,
hematocrit 29.1, platelet count 266.  Sodium 136, potassium
4.4, chloride 101, bicarbonate 24, BUN 26, creatinine 0.7,
glucose 243.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  By systems:

1.  Cardiac:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine Unit
on [**9-7**].  She was ruled out for myocardial infarction
with serial CKs.  On [**9-8**], her hematocrit was 26.5.  She
was asymptomatic, but given her cardiac history and the
thought that her electrocardiogram changes could represent
demand ischemia, she was transfused slowly with two units of
packed red blood cells.  She was evaluated between units and
her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  On [**9-9**], following the second unit, she developed shortness of
breath and her 02 saturations decreased to 87% on two liters
of oxygen.  She was tired and on 100% nonrebreather and her
02 saturations elevated to 90%.  She was given 240 mg Lasix,
put on BiPAP, and admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit.  Her pressure was 188/100.  She was started on
nitroglycerin drip.  A post electrocardiogram showed ST
elevations in V2 and V3, and T wave inversions in V3 through
V6.  She was ruled out for myocardial infarction again with
serial CKs.  She was admitted back to the floor on [**9-10**]
after being weaned from her nitroglycerin drip and placed on
Isordil 10 mg po t.i.d.

On [**9-10**], she complained of chest pressure that was
persistent all night.  A repeat electrocardiogram was
performed that was unchanged from her Surgical Intensive Care
Unit electrocardiogram.  She was currently stable and
asymptomatic.  Given patient's decreased functional status
and mild neurological dysfunction, Cardiology recommended
medical management of her ischemic disease.

2.  Gastrointestinal:  Patient had an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy at this hospital
in the past showing gastritis and adenomatous polyps in the
colon.  A small bowel follow through was performed on [**9-10**] and was negative for a source of bleed.  Her hematocrit
remained stable until discontinued.  She can follow-up with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in his clinic in three months if she wishes or
if she has further symptoms.  She will have weekly hematocrit
checks at rehabilitation.

3.  Psychiatric:  Psychiatry consult was called.  The
discharge summary of her more recent geriatric psychiatric
unit was obtained.  Her current medications were continued.
Psychiatric recommended no changes in medicine at this time.

DISCHARGE LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 9.1,
hematocrit 36.3, platelets 231,000.  Sodium 141, potassium
3.8, chloride 103, bicarbonate 26, BUN 33, creatinine 0.9,
glucose 159.

1.  Congestive heart failure
2.  Gastrointestinal bleed.  Source unclear.
3.  Depression.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Zoloft 75 mg q.d.
2.  K-Dur 10 mEq b.i.d.

4.  Glyburide 10 mg b.i.d.
5.  Folate 1 tablet q.d.
6.  Tums 1 tablet b.i.d.
7.  Iron 325 mg b.i.d.
8.  Protonix 40 mg q.d.
9.  Serzone 100 mg q.a.m., 50 mg at 1 p.m. and 150 mg q.h.s.
10. Zestril 20 mg q.d.
