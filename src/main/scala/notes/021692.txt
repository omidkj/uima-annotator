HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old Vietnamese
male with a history of hypertension, history of TB treated 10
years ago, who is transferred from the ICU status post stent to
right mainstem bronchus and preliminary path showing non-
small cell lung cancer.  The patient presented to [**Hospital 1281**]
Hospital on [**2128-5-10**] for an increasing shortness of breath
plus wheezing.  Shortness of breath has been chronic for
approximately 2 years, but worsened on night of [**2128-5-9**].
The patient awoke from sleep feeling short of breath, unable
to catch breath to walk.  No fevers, chills or sweats.  No
cough.  Nonsmoker.  No weight loss or change in appetite.  No
abdominal pain.  No pleuritic pain.  Taken by EMS at outside
hospital, and the patient was intubated for respiratory
stress.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral upper lobe scarring,
thrombosis and continued difficulty with oxygenation.  The
patient was noted to have increased sputum secretion with
frequent plugging.  Sputum grew methicillin-sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus.  Initially treated with one dose of
vancomycin and then switched to cefazolin.  CT of the chest
performed, which showed bullous emphysematous changes with
apical scarring.  External compression of right mainstem
bronchus with question of node versus tumor.  Small left
upper lobe pneumothorax.  The patient's mental status became
unresponsive.  Outside hospital head CT showed no bleeding or
mass effect.  Neurologic consult concerned for anoxic
encephalopathy, but mental status improved off sedation.  The
patient was transferred and Interventional Pulmonary at [**Hospital1 1444**] placed stents in the right
mainstem bronchus and the patient was extubated.  The
patient's mental status continued to improve in the MICU and
preliminary lung biopsy from the right mainstem bronchus
showed non-small cell lung cancer.  The patient was
transferred to the medical floor.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Non-small cell lung cancer.  The patient
has no medical insurance.  The patient is now applying for
Mass Health.  The patient will be seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the
