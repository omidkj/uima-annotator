Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery on [**2151-3-10**] and
underwent a diagnostic angiogram. Reader referred to operative
note for full details. Prior to his angio the patient received
2units of FFP for his elevated INR. Post procedurally the
patient received 3 more units of FFP for preparation of his
sheath pull. While in the PACU the patient began experiencing
shortness of breath, increased work of breathing and
tachycardia. Given his history of renal failure, renal was
consulted to perform emergent dialysis. He was then transferred
to the CVICU where 1.6L was removed via HD. Upon completing
dialysis the patient had cardiopulmonary arrest and CPR was
started and the patient was intubated. Patient then had a rhythm
return and was started on neo synephrine, vasopressin and
milrinone drips. A bedside ECHO revealed an EF of 20%. The
cardiology service was consulted who took the patient to the
cath lab on PPD1 for a placement of an intraaortic balloon pump
via a left groin approach and was then started on a heparin gtt.
He was then transferred to the CVICU in critical condition. He
remained on multiple pressors, CVVH and intubated. On PPD2 the
patient remained critical stable, the neo synephrine was changed
to levophed, vasopressin was weaned off and milrinone remained.
He was also started on Vancomycin for his IABP and given 5mg PO
vitamin K to reverse the INR. CVVH continued and the patient
tolerated volume removal. Patient had his right arterial sheath
removed once his INR normalized. Overnight the patient began
experiencing more tachyarrhythmia and required increased
vasopressor support. The following morning, the family after
discussion with the nephrology attending, cardiology service and
vascular service decided to make the patient CMO. The patient
was then continued on a fentanyl gtt and the vasopressors were
stopped. He then lost vital signs and was pronounced dead at
12:24pm.
