Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2163-10-1**]
1. Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x3:  Left internal
mammary artery to left anterior ascending artery, and saphenous
vein grafts to distal circumflex and posterior descending

History of Present Illness:
59 year old female with PMH significant for hypertension,
dyslipidemia, tobacco use that presented to outside hospital
emergency department with chest pain on [**9-29**].  She had chest pain
lasting about 1 hour the night before at home that resolved on
its own and went to sleep.  She felt okay in the morning and
went to work were she had another episode and called her PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] PCP referred her to the emergency room and en route she had
nitroglycerin SL that resolved the pain.  Additionally she had
nausea, shortness of breath and sweating with the chest pain
episodes.  She was admitted to the outside hospital and
underwent workup which cardiac enzymes were negative, nuclear
stress indicated ischemic changes, so she was referred for
cardiac catheterization.  That revealed significant coronary
artery disease and additionally she was hypertensive to the 200
systolic b/p that required intravenous medications of
nitroglycerin and hydralazine.  She was transferred in for
surgical evaluation. Cardiac Catheterization: Date: [**9-30**] at
[**Hospital1 **].  Right dominant LM 25% stenosis with eccentric
calcification LAD proximal calcification 50-60% tubular mid
stenosis,OM 1 sm diffusely diseased,OM 2 med no stenosis RCA 90%
proximal, 65 % mid, 50-60% long distal PDA without significant
stenosis. Right groin closure with Mynx. Cardiac Echocardiogram:
9/2/3011 [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] mild AI no AS, Mitral mild to mod MR, TV
mild TR,LVEF 55%.
Persantine [**2163-9-29**] - stress images revealed a small sized mild
intensity distal anterolateral defect

Pertinent Results:
[**2163-10-1**] Echo PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Doppler
parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results on [**2163-10-1**] at 11:00 AM.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is on no inotropes. Left ventricular
function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular function is
unchanged. Mitral regurgitation is mild (1+). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aorta is intact post decannulation.
.
[**2163-10-4**] Carotid Ultrasound: 1. A 60-69% stenosis in the right
internal carotid and 70-79% stenosis in the left internal
carotid artery with significant heterogeneous atherosclerotic
plaques. 2. The assessment of the right system is limited due to
presence of dressings and central line.
.
[**2163-10-6**] CXR: In the interim from the prior examination, a
left-sided chest tube has been removed. Small [**Hospital1 **]-apical
pneumothoraces are not significantly changed. There are,
however, worsening bibasilar opacities, right greater than left,
which could represent aspiration or developing pneumonia.
Persistent perihilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No
significant pleural effusion is seen. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unchanged. Median sternotomy wires appear intact

Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission he underwent pre-operative testing and was
brought to the operating room on [**2163-10-1**] where the patient
underwent urgent CABG x 3 with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Please see operative
note for surgical details. Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. Within
24 hours she was weaned from sedation, extubated, alert and
oriented and breathing comfortably. She became agitated and
confused on the evening of POD 1, requiring Haldol. There are
inconsistent reports of the patient's alcohol consumption, and
she was given benzodiazepines for possible alcohol withdrawal as
well as vitamins. Carotid ultrasound was performed and revealed
a 60-69% stenosis of the [**Country **] and a 70-79% stenosis of the [**Doctor First Name 3098**].
The patient is advised to follow up with vascular surgery as an
outpatient. The PCP has recommended Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29316**] of [**Hospital1 **].
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight. The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued. Chest x-ray's post chest tube removal
revealed bil
