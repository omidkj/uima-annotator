Admission Date:  [**2147-6-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2147-6-11**]


Service:  .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89 year old
female with a history of significant coronary artery disease
and ejection fraction of less than 15% who, on the day of
admission, was in her usual state of health until around 10
p.m. when she was sitting in a chair and felt increasing
shortness of breath with associates increase in heart rate
and palpitations.  Denies chest pain or nausea.  The patient
did experience diaphoresis for approximately ten to 20
minutes.  She called her neighbor who subsequently called
911.  The EMS arrived and found patient to be in moderate
respiratory distress with respiratory rate in the 30s and
oxygen saturations in the mid-80s.  The patient was
subsequently intubated en route to [**Hospital1 190**] where she was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and placed on a Nitroglycerin drip, given
intravenous Lasix and subsequently diuresed two liters urine
output.

The patient was successfully extubated ten hours after
admission with resultant oxygen saturations to 96% on room
air.  The patient was stabilized and transferred to the
medical floor on [**2147-6-9**].

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient with severe ischemic
cardiomyopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction of less
than 15% per [**2146-8-17**] echocardiogram.  It was felt that
the patient's rapid improvement with diuresis and blood
pressure control makes flash pulmonary edema the most likely
diagnosis upon admission.  There was a question of possible
infiltrate causing hypoxia and dyspnea, however, with
intravenous diuresis a repeat chest x-ray did not reveal any
focal infiltrate.  The patient remained stable on her
outpatient cardiac regimen.

The patient was ruled out for myocardial ischemia as possible
etiology of flash pulmonary edema and diffuse primarily old
EKG changes.  She ruled out with CK of 192, 197, 47, with CK
MB 7, 9 and troponin of 0.9 and 0.3.

Of note, on [**2147-6-10**], her troponin I increased to 5.5
but subsequently decreased the following day.  As the patient
had no symptoms of chest pain or EKG changes, the decision
was made to continue medical management and have the patient
follow-up with primary care physician as an outpatient.  The
patient remained chest pain free throughout this
hospitalization and continued to remain stable on outpatient
medical regimen.  As the patient had refused cardiac
catheterization in the past, this was again discussed and the
patient again refused elective catheterization.  The decision
to manage medically was agreed upon with primary care
physician.

2.  Pulmonary:  After initial episode of hypoxia, the patient
remained stable status post intravenous diuresis and
afterload reduction.  At time of discharge, her oxygen
saturations remained stable between 94 and 98% on room air.
A repeat PA and lateral chest x-ray was done to rule out
infiltrate status post diuresis which revealed no
infiltrates.

The patient had no cough, fever or sputum production.  She
did receive a single dose of Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the
Emergency Department prior to diuresis for possible pneumonia
as etiology of shortness of breath.  The antibiotics were not
continued as the patient had no leukocytosis or fever.  Her
fever curve and white blood cell count were monitored
throughout this hospitalization and remained negative.  A
repeat urine culture was drawn given a positive nitrites with
increased bacteria in her urinalysis.  Urine culture,
however, remained negative at time of discharge.

She is to follow-up with her primary care physician should
she develop symptoms of dysuria or fever.  \

3.  Endocrine:  The patient is a type 2 diabetic who, in the
past, has controlled her diabetes mellitus with diet alone.
Fingerstick blood sugars were performed four times a day and
glucose remained in good control.  The patient refused
regular insulin sliding scale but however, never had a
fingerstick blood sugar greater than 200.  She was continued
on Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and Fosamax for
osteoporosis.

4.  Renal:  The patient's BUN and creatinine remained stable
with diuresis, hovering around a baseline of 0.9 to 1.3.  The
patient had excellent urine output and a Foley catheter was
discontinued prior to discharge.  The patient was able to
urinate spontaneously.

5.  Gout:  The patient was continued on Allopurinol.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to home with
home Physical Therapy and [**Hospital6 407**].
