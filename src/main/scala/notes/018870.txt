Imaging
[**7-11**] Video swallow
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of aspiration or penetration.  For full
details,
please see speech pathology report in webOMR.

CXR (5 done):--Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
--In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has
been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip
approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends
well into the stomach, beyond the lower margin of the image.
--In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has
been
placement of a right IJ catheter that extends to about the level
of the
cavoatrial junction.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
--[**6-19**]: IMPRESSION:  Orogastric tube ends in the distal stomach.
ET tube in standard placement.  Previous vascular engorgement
and mild pulmonary edema has cleared in the upper lungs, but
consolidation in the lower lungs, particularly the right has
worsened, though this could be atelectasis, is more concerning
for extensive pneumonia.
--[**6-21**]: FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing
parenchymal opacities at the right lung base and in the left
perihilar area have substantially decreased in extent and
severity.  As a consequence, the lung parenchyma is more
transparent and lucent than before.  The image shows no evidence
of newly appeared parenchymal opacities.  The size of the
cardiac silhouette is constant and normal.  No pulmonary edema.
The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.
--[**7-1**]: There are new bilateral alveolar consolidations that
could be compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
--[**7-3**]: Unchanged tracheostomy tube, unchanged l
