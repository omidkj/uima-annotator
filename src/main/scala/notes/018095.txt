Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 50 year old female with paraplegia secondonary to MVA
in [**2142**], history of recurrent resistant infections, here with
pneumonia and hypotension.

#  pneumonia/sepsis: patient presented with hypotension and
radiographic evidence of bilateral pneumonia. She required
levophed for blood pressure support for a few days for SBP 70-90
range. She was given broad spectrum antibiotics for vancomycin
and zosyn. She was also worked up for other sources with a
negative urinalysis and culture, negative legionella urinary
antigen and two sputum cultures which were oral flora only. She
did come in with a PICC line in place and there was thought this
might be a source of infection but blood cultures remained
negative and the site was clean. In addition, the PICC was only
in for 10 days on admission. She completed a 7 day course of
antibiotics for healthcare associated pneumonia. She had
aggressive chest PT and incentive spirometry use.  She is being
discharged on 2L NC oxygen as her oxygen saturation declined to
the mid 80's on room air with activity. Of note she has required
oxygen at home on and off prior to this admission.

#  Anemia:
Baseline HCT 30-35. In the hospital she was stable at about
27-25 range. Prior studies have shown anemia of chronic disease.
Her HCT was closely monitored.

#  Delirium:
She was very anxious and delirius in the ICU and a psychiatric
consult was obtained. She likely was delirius from being in the
ICU and for polypharmacy and from her illness. Her medication
regimen was optimized and cut down to help prevent delirium. She
was offered an appointment with psychopharmacology to further
help with this, but she refused. She was provided with the
number at discharge if she changes her mind.

#  Chronic pain:
She was given her home methadone, baclofen, and lyrica. The
doses were lowered while she was delirius and then increased to
her home dose at discharge.  She complained of significant
chronic pain not controlled since [**2147-1-2**]. She was encouraged
to follow up with the psychopharmacologist for this which she
refused and also with her PCP and SW as we explained that pain
can be affected by many things including depression.

#  Hypothyroidism:
She was maintained on Levothyroxine.

#  Depression:
Home Citalopram 40 mg was continued. Psychiatry and social work
consults were following along.

#  Constipation:
She was on an aggressive bowel regimen to maintain her as
regular.

#  Access: PICC line which was removed prior to discharge.
