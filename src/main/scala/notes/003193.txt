Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with no intervention


History of Present Illness:
79-year-old with a history of CAD, with 2VD not candidate for
CABG s/p PCI with stent to ostial LAD [**1-/2107**] with residual known
proximal 80% Lcx in addition to a history of systolic CHF, COPD
and OSA who was transferred from the OSH after admission for
NSTEMI complicated by VT/VF which resolved with shock on the day
of transfer.
.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 40800**] presented to OSH yesterday ([**5-18**]) due to
worsening SOB, cough productive of whote phlegm and parasternal
chest pain which was related to cough and deep breathing but not
to exertion or rest without coughing. The cough had troubled her
for the preceeding two weeks. This was also associated with some
fatigue and chills but not with fever or night sweats. She
denied nasal congestion, sinus pain, ear pain, throat pain,
heartburn, diarrhea or urinary symptoms.
.
She reported orthopnea X 2 pillows, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, nocturia X [**1-5**]. These have been stable in recent days
prior to admission. She denied any lower extremity swelling.
.
On review of systems, she complained of chronic arthritic pains.
Otherwise, she denied any nausea or vomiting, diaphoresis,
fevers, prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
hemoptysis, bloody stools and fevers. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for absence of ankle
edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
At the OSH, her admission vitals were as follows: BP 116/60 HR
79 RR 29 SaO2 89% on 2L. She exhibited signs of florid heart
failure (CXR findings and a BNP 1300) and had positive cardiac
enzymes (Trop 4.96). Impression was a NSTEMI. She got 2 units of
blood as her Hct was 26. She was also diuresed overnight with
Lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **]. As there was suspicion of a GI bleed (Blood on
per-rectal examination, guaiac positive), all anticoagulants and
antiplatelets were stopped and she was admitted to the ICU.
Today ([**5-19**]) In the early PM, after eating lunch she was found
to be unresponsive and in VTach/VFib. She was given CPR and then
defibrillated x1 into normal sinus rhythm. The downtime was <1
minute. She was then put on a 50% venti mask and she remained
hemodynamically stable. An amiodarone gtt was started.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of catheterisation.
