Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
evaluation of tracheostomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
75y/o M with a PMH of ESRD on HD, CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy,
PAF, morbid obesity, COPD, OSA, and chronic tracheostomy
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of tracheostomy. Per [**Hospital1 **]
reports there is concern for malfunctional tracheostomy as the
patient's peak pressures have been rising on ventilator. Per
respiratory therapy notes from [**Hospital1 **], prior to [**2150-9-9**] was on
AC 14/650/+5/50%, peak pressures rising over past week to mid
30s and 40s. RT has been unable to pass the inline catheter due
to resistance. Pt taken off vent to swith to 14 fr however
unable to pass airway. He was switched to SIMV 650/12/50%/ PEEP
5 with increased comfort.

The patient underwent a recent R BKA on [**2150-8-27**]. He had episodes
of hypoxia related to mucous plugging and sputum grew MRSA and
was started on a short course of vancomycin. He has chronic
decubitous ulcers. He received a short course of linezolid,
aztreonam and flagyl during his post-op BKA course, all
discontinued on [**9-1**]. He is on dialysis for ESRD.

CXR [**2150-9-9**]:
In comparison with study of [**6-27**], there is little change in the
appearance of the tracheostomy tube. Dobbhoff tube is in place,
though the image ends above the diaphragm so the tip cannot be
seen. Central catheter tip similarly is difficult to evaluate
and appears to be in the right atrium.
Prominence of interstitial markings persists and there are
probable bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 y/o with chronic tracheostomy, HD-dependent ESRD, sacral/LE
ulcers, R [**Hospital 6024**] transferred to the MICU for evaluation of his
tracheostomy.

# Respiratory failure:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77792**] has a history of hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory
failure and is s/p trachostomy earlier in [**2149**].  He was noted to
have increasing peak pressures with difficulty in passing a
catheter due to resistance and was transferred for further
evaluation of his trach.  IP was consulted and performed
bronchoscopy on [**9-10**].  He was found to have diffuse airway edema
consistent with volume overload.  There were no significant
secretions and a full survey of the airways reveals all airways
were patent without any endobronchial lesions.  His trach was
felt to be in appropriate position without any obstruction.
There was no tracheobronchomalacia.

He should be continued on vancomycin for treatment of MRSA
pneumonia.

Please note that the findings of the sputum culture and BAL were
pending at the time of discharge.

# ESRD:
Related to diabetic nephropathy.  Patient did not receive HD at
[**Hospital1 18**] as he will be receiving it upon return to [**Hospital1 **].
Continued renagel.

# Atrial Fibrillation:
Continued metoprolol.  Coumadin was held for supratherapeutic
[**Hospital1 263**] of 4.  Please dose coumadin as needed to maintain [**Hospital1 263**] of
[**1-18**].

Please note that coumadin is not on the current medication list
as it should be held given that his [**Month/Day (3) 263**] is elevated. This is
most likely due to the interaction of coumadin with his current
antibiotics (levofloxacin and fluconazole). Please restart
coumadin cautiously once his [**Month/Day (3) 263**] is < 2.5 to maintain an [**Month/Day (3) 263**]
between 2 and 3.

Also note that subcutaneous heparin was stopped during your
hospital stay.

# Type II DM: continued sliding scale insulin and Lantus.

# R BKA with Sacral and leg ulcers:
Continued current wound care, no signs of active infection

# Plasma cell dyscrasia:
Found to have IgA kappa on serum electrophoresis with an
imbalance in the free kappa:lambda light chain ratio. BM biopsy
showed 5-10% plasma cells.  During his work up the hematology
team felt he likely had MGUS and ordered a retroperitoneal
biopsy of a mass that was noted on his abd CT scan. His FNA was
non-diagnostic and a needle core biopsy showed fragments of
lymphoid tissue with quiescent appearing germinal centers.
Continued outpatient follow up

# Nutrition: NPO; tube feeds continued.
