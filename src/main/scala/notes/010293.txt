Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
airway monitoring

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
56 y/o M admitted to [**Hospital6 **] for respiratory
distress. He noted the onset of respiratory sx's ~6 months ago
and weight loss, which lead to a laryngeal biopsy noting
laryngeal ca dx [**2-25**]. Arrangements had been made to start chemo
and XRT on [**4-15**] at [**Hospital1 789**] VA.
.
Prior to presentation, the patient was brushing the snow from
his car when he became SOB and presented to [**Hospital3 46817**] with stridor. He also noted mildly increased cough with
phlegm production, as well as 3-4 days of subjective chills.
There a CT scan noted a large enhancing L paraglottic mass w/ an
airway lumen of 3x6 mm with multiple metastatic nodes and
question of esophageal extention. Pt was given combivent nebs
and solumedrol 125 in the ED. A trach was then placed
percutaneously, and the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as no beds
were available at [**Hospital1 789**] VA.

Past Medical History:
-Lanyngeal ca dx on larygeal bx, w/o h/o radiation or node
dissection
-s/p G-tub
-h/o R thumb amputation [**9-/2161**]
-HTN
-h/o Lyme dx and babesiosis treated this past summer

Social History:
worked as a carpenter, stopped smoking 2 weeks ago

Family History:
sister w/ DM

40%trach
GEN: Pt thin appearing but in NAD
HEENT: nonicteric, mucosa slightly dry, trach in good position;
oropharynx difficult to visualize but no erythema
CHEST: transmitted upper airway sounds but no wheezes, whales
CV: distant HS, RRR

Pertinent Results:
CXR: The patient is status post tracheostomy. The tracheostomy
tube appears to be in good position. The heart, mediastinal and
hilar contours appear to be within normal limits. The pulmonary

are grossly clear without evidence for pneumonia. IMPRESSION: No
evidence of pneumonia. Status post tracheostomy.

OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION

EVALUATION:
An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed
today in collaboration with Radiology.  Thin liquid,
Nectar-thick
liquid, honey thick liquid and pureed consistency barium were
administered. Results follow:

ORAL PHASE:
Bolus control was within normal limits.  He could form a bolus
with liquids, but no ground or solid consistencies were tested.
Premature spillover was seen.  Mild tongue weakness was noted
with difficulty transporting material from the front to the back
of his mouth.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE:
There was a mild to moderate delay in initiation of the
pharyngeal swallow.  Once started, palatal elevation was normal.

Laryngeal elevation was moderately to severely reduced.
Epiglottic deflection was absent.  Upper esophageal sphincter
relaxation was also reduced.  After the swallow, a moderate
amount of residue remained in his pharynx.  This mixed with
secretions pooling in his throat, and spilled into the airway
leading to aspiration after the swallow.

ANTERIOR TO POSTERIOR POSITION:
Vocal cord movement was reduced on the Left side.
Pharyngeal contraction was better on the Right, and food and
liquid tended to go down the right side. More residue remained
on
the right side, as there was no space in the valleculae or
pyriform sinuses on the left due to the presence of the mass.

ASPIRATION/PENETRATION:
Aspiration occurred with all consistencies; thin liquid, nectar
thick liquid, honey thick liquid and pudding.  Aspiration
occurred before the swallow due to premature spillover and
swallow initiation delay; during the swallow due to reduced
vocal
cord closure, and after the swallow due to spillage of residue
mixed with secretions into the airway.  No cough was produced
upon aspiration.  A cued cough was effective in reducing but not
in eliminating the aspiration.

TREATMENT TECHNIQUES:
His most functional swallow with the least amount of aspiration
occurred when he swallowed with a chin tuck, used the
swallow-cough-swallow technique, and alternated between one bite
and one sip.  Aspiration was reduced but not eliminated.

SUMMARY:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] aspirates all consistencies due to his laryngeal
mass and the excess secretions in his oropharynx.  We were able
to reduce but not to eliminate the aspiration when he swallowed
with a chin tuck, used the swallow-cough-swallow technique and
alternated between bites of puree and sips of Nectar-thick
liquid.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Remain strictly NPO for now with PEG feeds for nutrition,
    hydration and medications

2.  Suggest medically treating his secretions to reduce them
    with something like a Scopolamine patch

3.  Repeat videoswallow once his secretions have decreased
    to see if he might be able to take small amounts of
    nectar-thick liquids and pureed foods PO for pleasure
    using a chin tuck, swallow-cough-swallow and alternating
    consistencies

These recommendations were shared with the patient, the nurse
and
the medical team.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
      SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
      STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE.    MODERATE GROWTH.
         BEING ISOLATED FOR SENSITIVITIES.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE - pt appears to have extensive
involvement of his tumor and had stridor upon presentation to
OSH. He is much improved after trach placement, and is now
comfortable with normal sats. CXR's show no PNA.
-cont frequent suctioning.
.
2) LEUKOCYTOSIS: unclear etiology. Initially was ascribed to
steroid treatment at OSH, but WBC count has remained elevated
for several days. Pt denies diarrhea.  Sputum culture shows
Strep Pnuemo colonization vs. tracheitis/PNA.
-will treat for suspected respirtory infection for 7 days with
ceftriaxone.
.
3) LARYNGEAL CARCINOMA:
-pt is due to start chemo/radiation at [**Hospital1 789**] VA on Wed,
[**4-15**].
-Pt has received a bed at [**Hospital1 789**] VA and will transfer the
patient to start recieving treatment
.
4) TACHYCARDIA: Likely [**3-12**] slight volume depletion and low grade
fevers. Responds to IVF.
.
5) HTN - continue Lisinopril, monitor BP.
.
6) FEN - continue TF's. Failed S&S video study.
.
7) PPx - placed on SQ heparin, bowel regimen, taking TF's
.
8) Access - PIV.
