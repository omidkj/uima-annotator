Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the service of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 363**] for a
lumbar laminectomy.  He was informed and consented and elected
to proceed.  Please see Operative Note for procedure in detail.

Post-operatively he was given antibiotics and pain medication.
A hemovac drain was placed intra-operatively and this was
removed POD 3.
On the floor the patient was receiving pain control with
epidural through [**4-5**] and was transitioned to PO meds then. He
reportedly got 10mg of oxycodone and 0.5mg dilaudid at noon. At
approximately 3pm he was sitting in the bedside chair sleeping
when a BP check revealed SBP of 60. He was also hypoxic with
sats in the low 80s. HR was mid 80s. Per the responding team he
was not tachypnic. Temp was 100.9. He was layed supine and
bolused 2LNS which improved his BP to 104/80 and a 100% NRB
increased his sats to 94%. He was unable to be weaned off the
NRB and transferred to the TICU for further care.  Spiral CT
revealed:
1. Bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli.
2. Mild-to-moderate bibasilar atelectasis with probable
superimposed mild
consolidation suggestive of infection or aspiration.
3. Probable cholelithiasis.
4. Heterogeneous appearance of the prostate. This could be a
normal variant
if there are no clinical symptoms for prostatitis. However, if
there is a
concern for infection in this region, an ultrasound examination
can be
performed to assess for fluid collections.
5. Post-L2 through L5 laminectomies, with expected neighboring
postoperative
change.
He was started on a heparin drip and subsequently transitioned
to coumadin with an every other day dosing of 2.5mg.
His bladder catheter was removed POD 3 and his diet was advanced
without difficulty.  He was able to work with physical therapy
for strength and balance.  He was discharged in good condition
and will follow up in the Orthopaedic Spine clinic.
