Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7281**]
Chief Complaint:
LBP/BLE pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2160-5-15**]: L4-S1 posterior decompression and fusion w/ bone marrow
aspirate


History of Present Illness:
She is s/p a left-sided L4-L5 and L5-S1 microlumbar discectomy
on [**12-26**].  She initially did well with her left lower
extremity radiculopathy.  Unfortunately,she has gone on to
develop progressive symptoms.  For that reason, she underwent
followup MRI.  She describes pain that radiates down the left
leg and into the little toe.  She has some right lower extremity
weakness from prior surgery.  Her bowel and bladder function is
normal.


Past Medical History:
* DM1 - complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy autonomic
dysfunction, gastropathy
* HTN
* Asthma
* S/P Renal/Pancreas Transplant ([**2139**])
* Numular Eczema
* H/O Rectal Bleeding ([**2152**])
* Psuedoaneurysm of left External Iliac Artery s/p stent ([**2154**])

* H/O Deep Venous Thrombophlebitis ([**2155**])
* Chronic Lower Back Pain
* Left First Toe Osteomyelitis
* Retinopathy of Right Eye


Social History:
Patient denies tobacco or illicit drug use. She infrequently
consumes alcohol.
She was living with her daughter but recently moved out.  She
currently lives alone.  She has a very close relationship with
her daughter.


Family History:
nc

Physical Exam:
On examination, her strength was [**5-28**] in hip flexion,
extension,quadriceps, hamstrings, and plantarflexion
bilaterally. Dorsiflexion was graded at 4/5 on the left and was
normal on the right.  Extensor hallucis longus could not be
assessed on the left due to previous toe surgery and was normal
on the right.
Her sensory examination revealed a decreased appreciation of
light touch in both the medial and lateral aspect of her left
foot.

ON DISCHARGE:
Bialteral IP's [**4-28**], quad, ham, gastroc, AT, and Right [**Last Name (un) 938**] 5-/5,
left [**Last Name (un) 938**] [**4-28**](secondary to toe surgery), incision clean dry
intact with steri strips, sensation decreased to light touch on
right lateral thigh and left lateral foot, ambulates with
walker.


Pertinent Results:
An MRI of the lumbosacral spine obtained on [**2160-3-3**],demonstrates prior surgery both L4-L5 and L5-S1.  There is
a grade 1 spondylolisthesis at L4-L5.  There is lateral recess
stenosis bilaterally at L4-L5.  There is a recurrent residual
disc herniation at L5-S1 on the right side.  Flexion and
extension x-rays were obtained which demonstrate a grade 1
spondylolisthesis at L4-L5 and no abnormal movement when flexion
and extension views were compared.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Lumbar fusion: Pt was admitted on [**2160-5-15**] and underwent above
procedure.  Postoperativley she was continued on her home meds.
She remained overnight in PACU and required multiple fluid
boluses for low urine output.  She was seen in consult by renal
and [**Last Name (un) **] who followed her throughout her hospital course.  She
had JP that was removed late in the POD#1.  She was out of bed
with PT.  She was managed on PO pain medications. On [**5-17**] her
foley was removed and a UA was negative. She had a chest X-ray
which showed small bilateral pleural effusions. On [**5-18**] her
hematocrit was 26 and was being followed for potential need for
transfusion. On [**5-19**] her hematocrit was 25.4 and did not require
trasnfusion.  She was screened for rehab, however due to
postoperative complications of labile blood pressure, difficult
to control blood glucose, anemia and low grade fevers, discharge
was delayed (see below for discussion of postoperative
complications).

2. Fevers: Post-operative fevers as high as 101.2 without focal
symptoms of infection. Blood and urine cultures were drawn and
patient had CXR on [**5-19**].  Started empirically on ciprofloxacin
for presumed cystitis with positive U/A.  When urine culture
returned negative on [**2160-6-2**], ciprofloxacin was discontinued.
Patient defervesced with no evidence of infectious etiology.

3. labile BP: patient has history of autonomic instability from
underlying diabetes mellitus compounded by hypovolemia in
setting of low grade fevers and anemia.  Low salt diet was
discontinued and midodrine was titrated up to 5mg TID in an
effort to decrease orthostatic hypotension.  Medications with
anticholinergic side effects were also discontinued/ decreased
to alleviate orthostatic symptoms.  Although B-blocker was
likely contributing to orthostatic hypotension by blocking
compensatory response in heart rate, carvedilol was continued
given marked supine hypertension.  Patient continued to have
labile blood pressure, but her symptoms had improved
significantly and she was able to perform ADLs without
significant difficulty.

4. acute on chronic anemia: Hct on admission 30.8, drifted down
to 25 following spinal surgery. Likely etiology from multiple
chronic medical problems i.e. renal insufficiency and blood loss
from surgery. Iron studies are indicative of some mild iron
-deficiency with serum iron of 21 and a borderline low
transferrin saturation (14%). Ferritin is elevated in setting of
illness. No signs of hemolysis. Patient continued on iron
supplementation with Hct remaining stable through remainder of
hospital stay.  Hct on discharge was 27.6

5. s/p renal tranplant: during course of hospitalization,
creatinine trended up to 1.6 from recent baseline of 1.1- 1.3.
Etiology of renal damage unclear, may be indicative of brief
period post op hypotension.  Continued cyclosporine/ prednisone/
azathiodine at current dose.  Continued bactrim SS
