Date of Birth:  [**2134-3-31**]        Sex:  F

Service:  NB

HISTORY:  She was born to a 34 year old gravida III,
para I mother, blood type A positive, antibody negative,
hepatitis B surface antigen, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune.
Prenatal course was notable for amniocentesis with 46XX,
otherwise benign.  Estimated date of confinement was [**2134-4-13**].
Mother presented in spontaneous labor and had a precipitous
delivery with meconium stained amniotic fluid and
nonreassuring fetal tracing.  Infant emerged on [**2134-3-31**] at 2100
hours.  She was suctioned below the cords and no meconium was
noted.  She went to the Newborn Nursery for further care.
She was noted to have two cyanotic episodes and was rushed to
the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further care.  There was
an epidural anesthesia.  GBS was negative.  No maternal
fever.  Rupture of membranes was 15 minutes prior to the
delivery.  No intrapartum antibiotics.  Upon arrival to the
unit the infant had three cyanotic episodes, all associated
with apnea with desaturations to 58, 68 and 70 percent.  No
extremity movement was noted.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission weight of 3025 grams,
head circumference of 34, length of 18 inches, blood pressure
of 67/41 with a mean of 50.  Heart rate of 150, respiratory
rate of 38 to 40.  In general she was active, appropriately
responsive.  Anterior fontanelle was open and full.  Normal
S1, S2 with no murmur.  Breath sounds were clear.  Abdomen
was soft, nondistended, nontender.  Extremities were well
perfused.  Tone was appropriate for gestational age with a
normal female external genitalia.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has been without murmur
   throughout her hospitalizations and has been
   hemodynamically stable.  Due to infarct noted on head a CT
   and echocardiogram were obtained on day of life number two
   which showed mild to moderate left ventricular
   dysfunction.  This echocardiogram was repeated on day of
   life number four which showed only mild left
   ventricular function.  She was seen by cardiology. They felt
the ventricular dysfuntion was related to her antenatal event.
Because it was improved, they did not need to follow her.

1. RESPIRATORY:  Due to apneic spells the patient was
   intubated in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit on day of
   life number one.  She was into room on day of life number
   two and after having no further apneic spells she has been
   stable on room air with occasional O2 saturation drop to
   the 70s.

1. FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Patient was initially
   NPO with total fluids of 80 cc per kilo per day.  She was
   allowed to right ear lib feed until day of life number
   four when it was noted that she had trace guaiac positive
   stools as well as some flecks of blood suctioned from a
   nasogastric tube.  At that point she was made NPO.  A KUB
   was obtained which showed dilated loops but was otherwise
   unremarkable.  At that point she was started on Zantac as
   well as antibiotics.  On day of life number 5 she passed a
   heme negative stool and had no further blood noted from
   her nasogastric tube and therefore was allowed to start
   feeds.  At the time of discharge, she was taking ad lib po
   feeds of BM or Similac 20 cal/oz.  Her weight at discharge
   3115 gram, HC 35 cm, Length 51 cm.

1. NEUROLOGIC:  The patient had a CT done on day of life
   number one which revealed a right posterior cerebral
   artery infarct.  She subsequently had an EEG which
   demonstrated seizure activity, both clinical and
   subclinical seizures.  She was at that point loaded with
   phenobarbital and then started on 5 mg per kilogram per
   day divided B.I.D. of phenobarbital.  Her most recent
   level was on day of life number 5 which was 40.7.  She had
   a MRI on [**2134-4-6**] which was consistent with a post
   temporal/occipital lobe. She was discharged to home on
   phenobarb 12 mg po QD with a level of 32.6 taken on [**2134-4-9**].
   She had no other clinical episodes of clinical of seizures.

1. INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was initially started on
   ampicillin and Gentamicin for 48 hour rule out given the
   apneic episodes.  Blood culture was negative at 48 hours
   and therefore antibiotics were discontinued.  On day of
   life number four when she had these guaiac positive
   stools, temperature and disability, blood culture was
   resent.  CBC was reassuring and the baby was started on
   ampicillin and gentamicin with a plan for 48 hour rule
   evaluation. The antibiotics were discontinued and she had
   no further infectious disease issues.  The remainder of her
   stools were heme negative.

1. HEME:  Patient had initial hematocrit of 63.4.  The most
   recent hematocrit is on [**2134-4-5**] which was
   59.5  She had coagulation studies done on day of life one
   which were normal.  She had an abnormal PT PTT for which
   hematology was consulted. Her repeats studies PT 11.7 PTT
   35.5 Fibrinogen 250, D-dimer negative.  She also had a
   hypercoagulation evaluation. Her Antithrombin III and Protein
   C and Protein S level were pending at time of discharge.

1. GI:  Her initial liver function studies done on day of life
   one ALT 30 AST 105.  Her peak bilirubin was DOL #3 8.7/0.3
   She had liver function studies prior to
   discharge AST 41 ALT 31 alk phos 195 albumin 3.
