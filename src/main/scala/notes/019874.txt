History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12307**] is a 80 y.o. Russian speaking Female w/ h.o. PAF, DM
II, CAd s/p CABG, UGI bld, C. Diff colitis  who presented to the
hospital s/p 2 falls, weakness.
.
History obtained via family member. Pt's family states that she
has been tired since starting the Tylenol w/ Codeine 2 weeks
ago. Yesterday in the bathroom she was noted to feel week enough
that she tried to lower herself to the floor. Her husband was
there and helped her up before she hit the ground. They deny any
LOC at that time, she did have some tearing of her skin over her
left leg. They were planning to come to the ED today given her
skin tears and back pain when she fell again this morning. It
was witnessed and described as her slipping down the chair. She
had no LOC but again had several more skin tears on her left
thigh.
.
Of note she recently increased her Furosemide dose 3 days prior
to admission from 20 [**Hospital1 **] to 40/20 due to progressive lower
extremity edema. The family states her weight has remained
stable over the past 3 days. She was also treated for a Proteus
UTI for which she completed a 7 day course of Bactrim. She was
instructed to drink a lot of water and tea whilst on the Bactrim
(6 cups a day). She has a baseline O2 requirement at home which
has been weened down to 3L O2 since her cardiac surgery in
[**Month (only) 958**].
.
In the ED her initial vitals were noted to be T96.8, HR 64, BP
159/76, RR 18, Sat 84% on RA. She incidentally had labs drawn
which were significant for Neutrophillic predominant
leukocytosis of 17.3 (95.1N, 2.3L), hyponatremia to 117,
hyperkalemia 6.2, BUN/Cr 31/1.5. She was noted to have peaked T
waves in leads V1, V2 for which she received Calcium Gluconate
in addition to Sodium Bicarb 50meq x 1, Insulin/Dextrose,
Kayexalate. Her repeat K+ 30 minutes later was noted to be
persistently high at 6.6. Her CXR was notable for a horizontal
infiltration over the right lung field. Given the suspicious
infiltrate she received Levofloxacin 750mg x 1, Flagyl 500mg x 1
for CAP and Aspiration PNA coverage. She also underwent a CT
head which showed no acute pathology. U/A was unremarkable. She
also received a tetanus shot. For her hyponatremia she received
1L of NS.
.
Prior to leaving the ED her vitals were noted to be P70, BP
121/43, RR 18, Sat 98% on 3L. Her K level was noted to be 5.2.
In the ICU she was saturating well at 96% on 3L, afebrile, HR
70, BP 115/52, RR 19.

COMPARISON: Chest radiographs from [**2123-2-22**] and [**2123-1-12**]. AP
and lateral
radiographs redemonstrate cardiomegaly. In addition,
cardiomediastinal
contour is slightly wide, although unchanged since at least
[**2122-9-12**]. Lung volumes are low. Bilateral interstitial
markings reflect mild pulmonary edema, although in addition to
that, there is increased opacity in the left lung apex and left
retrocardiac area which reflects the consolidation, although the
etiology of this consolidation must be placed in clinical
context. Wedge compression deformities in the lower thoracic or
upper lumbar spine, appear progressed or new altogether from
[**2123-1-12**].

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable cardiomegaly, mediastinal widening, mild pulmonary
edema and left lung consolidations.
2. Spinal compression deformities which appear new or progressed
from
comparison studies done approximately 1 month earlier.

Brief Hospital Course:
Acute Renal Failure:
Pt's prior baseline Creatinine noted to be 0.7-0.8. On
presentation it was elevated at 1.5. According to the family she
has maintained the same PO intake, however 3 days ago she
increased her PO Lasix regimen, so there was initially some
concern for pre-renal [**Last Name (un) **] although urine lytes were not
consistent with this. Another potential contributor may have
been recent Bactrim use leading to AIN.  She initially improved
with fluid resuscitation and holding her spi and furosemide.  On
discarge from the ICU her creatinine had improved to 1.2.
However, she plateaued at this level and a Renal Consult was
obtained (see attached). It was felt she was mildly volume
overloaded given the pulmonary edema seen on her chest CT, and
Lasix was re-started at 10mg IV daily. Prior to receiving her
first dose of Lasix, her Cr improved to 1.0 and her sodium
worsened (see below). Patient should have daily electrolytes
monitored to evaluate response to Lasix.
.
HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
On examination pt noted by physician to be at baseline mental
status, which is orientated x 2, although her family found her
to be more confused than usual. Her last normal sodium was in
[**9-20**]. Per the family she usually drinks a lot of water and tea,
particularly after she was diagnosed with a UTI on [**2-18**]. Given
the recent increase in her diuretics her initial hyponatremia
may have been a combination of a naturesis with Furosemide and
replenishment with hypotonic fluid such as water and tea. She
initially improved with NS. With attempts to allow the patient
to self-correct off diuretics and bactrim, her sodium initially
improved to 128, then worsened on the day of transfer to 125. It
is likely that this recent worsening is secondary to
hypervolemia in setting of held diuretics, with an additional
underlying component of SIADH. She should have daily
electrolytes checked to monitor sodium response to
re-introduction of Lasix.

DIASTOLIC CHF: Patient has dCHF on prior cath, with normal LVEF.
She is s/
