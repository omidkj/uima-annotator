Pertinent Results:
echo [**4-7**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
mild global left ventricular hypokinesis with regional akinesis
of the distal half of the septum, severe hypokinesis of the
inferior wall, and mild apical dyskinesis. No intracavitary
thrombus is seen. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small circumferential
pericardial effusion.

MIBI3/10:
1. Moderate, reversible defect involving the mid and distal
inferolateral wall. 2. Moderate, partially reversible defect
involving the apex.
3. Moderate, reversible defect involving the mid and distal
anteroseptal wall.
4. Transient left ventricular dilatation with stress. Global
hypokinesis with
ejection fraction of 29%.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global
and regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD (or other
diffuse process; in the absence of a history of systolic
hypertension, an infiltrative process should be considered).
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement/free wall hypokinesis.

Vein mapping [**4-26**]

TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale examination was performed at
the level of the superficial veins of the bilateral upper
extremities with compression maneuvers.

In the upper extremities, the bilateral cephalic and basilic
veins are patent and fully compressible. Their caliber varies
between 2.8 mm and 4.2 mm for the right cephalic vein, between
1.5 and 3.9 mm for the right basilic vein, between 2.3 and 3.0
mm for the left cephalic vein, and between 2.6 and 4.7 mm for
the left basilic vein.

CONCLUSION: Pre-operative vein mapping with patency of the
bilateral cephalic and basilic veins and dimensions as stated
above.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. Wound cultures were obtained. Cardiology medicine
was requested to see the patient because of her congestive
heart failure on admission chest x-ray. The patient was
transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation
and treatment of congestive heart failure.

The patient an echocardiogram done which showed symmetrical
left ventricular hypertrophy with global and regional
systolic dysfunction, consistent with multivessel coronary
artery disease or other diffuse process. In the absence of
systolic hypertension and infiltrative process should be
considered. There is moderate pulmonary systolic
hypertension, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, right
ventricular cavity is enlarged, free wall is hypokinetic.
The patient underwent a myocardial perfusion stress which
demonstrated a transient dilatation of the left ventricle
with stress. The stress perfusion images showed a moderate
reduction in tracer distribution involving the mid and distal
inferolateral wall. He rest perfusion images demonstrated
this defect to be reversible. Stress perfusion images
additionally demonstrate a moderate defect in the tracer
uptake of the apex, and this defect was partially reversible.
The stress also demonstrated moderately reversible defects in
the mid and distal anteroseptal wall.  Calculated ejection
fraction was 29%.

Once the patient was compensated for her congestive heart
failure and her renal function stabilized, she underwent a
cardiac catheterization on [**2179-4-13**] with documented 3-
vessel disease with markedly elevated and right and left-
sided filling pressures. She underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/diagonal and
an angioplasty to the LAD with partially successful PTCA of
the right coronary. This was transected by catheter during
the catheterization. The patient was transferred to the CCU
for continued monitoring and rule out. Troponin levels were
0.59, 0.19, 0.08. The patient remained on the cardiology
service. Aspirin, Plavix, and Lopressor were continued. She
required a transfusion for a low hematocrit. This was related
to her chronic myelodysplasia disorder. A transesophageal
echocardiogram was obtained immediately post cardiac
catheterization. There was a small pericardial effusion.
There was no echocardiographic sign of tamponade. The patient
did experience contrast renal failure post cardiac
catheterization and required aggressive treatment for
hyperkalemia. The peak creatinine was 3.0. The patient
finally returned to baseline renal function with a creatinine
of 1.9 on [**2179-4-21**].

The patient was transferred to the vascular service that same
day. The patient was pre hydrated with Mucomyst and sodium
bicarbonate infusion and underwent a peripheral arteriogram
on [**2179-4-22**]. The patient tolerated the procedure. She
was without hematoma, and her creatinine remaine
