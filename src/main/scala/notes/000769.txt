Attending:[**Known firstname 23009**]
Chief Complaint:
Angina (Transfer from [**Hospital3 1280**] for Interventional Cath)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent x1 and bare
metal stents x2 to right coronary artery


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year old woman with COPD and PVD transfered
from [**Hospital3 1280**] for interventional cath after worsening CP X 4
days. Over the past 3-4 months, she endorses recurrent
non-exertional substernal chest pressure. These last 4 days the
chest pressure worsened, increasing in intensity and frequency.
She called 911 and was taken to [**Hospital3 **] by ambulance. In the
ED she reported same chest pain- ECG revealed no ischemic
changes. Sx were relieved with SL nitroglycerine. Patient was
admitted to [**Hospital3 1280**] where she received Nitro and heparin gtt,
ASA, plavix, metoprolol, and lipitor. She had no CP since
receving Nitro in [**Location 44023**]. Troponin T peaked at 0.2.
Diagnostic cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital3 1280**] revealed:
1.Severe single vessel CAD, with a focal 90% stenosis of the
distal RCA involving the origin of the PDA. Diffuse
calcification and mild-to-moderate disease of all three coronary
arteries 2.Normal LV systolic function. 3. Mild LV diastolic
dysfunction 4.No evidence of valvular disease. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] this AM for interventional catheterization.

.
At [**Hospital1 18**], she underwent cardiac catheterization with
identification of significant RCA disease. She received a DES to
the distal RCA and BMS x 2 to the mid RCA. The procedure was
complicated by closure of the PDA. The patient also experienced
significant oozing with a drop in hematocrit from 29.8 to 22.9.

.
Following the procedure, the patient was transfered from the
cath lab to the CCU for close overnight monitoring.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Cardiac Cath ([**2176-7-8**]):
1. Limited coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated one-vessel disease. The RCA had a 30% proximal
stenosis,
diffuse stenosis in the mid-RCA to 60% with a question of
thrombus and a
distal RCA 95% stenosis and an ostial rPDA 99% stenosis.
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the distal RCA into the PL
system
with a 2.75 x 15 mm Promus [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 3.5 distally and
3.0
proximally complicated by loss of the rPDA (see PTCA comments).
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid-RCA with overlapping
2.75 x
12 mm (distally) and 3.0 x 26 mm Integrity (proximally) stents
postdilated to 3.0 (see PTCA comments).
.
TTE ([**2176-7-9**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 66 year-old woman with COPD and
worsening CP/[**Hospital **] transferred from OSH for interventional cath
now status post PCI with stent x 3 to RCA.
.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
.
# CAD: Cardiac cath showed significant RCA disease now s/p PCI
with stent x3. She had BMS x2 placed to the mid RCA (2.75 x 12
mm (distally) and 3.0 x 26 mm Integrity (proximally) stents
postdilated to 3.0) and DES x1 to the distal RCA (2.75 x 15 mm
Promus [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 3.5 distally and 3.0 proximally). PCI
was c/b jailing of the rPDA which resulted in cessation of flow
to the PDA that was confirmed by angiography. She had a slight
bump in CKMB post procedure consistent with this finding, but
CKMB was downtrending at the time of discharge. Post-cath echo
showed normal RV size and wall motion.
.
# Post Procedure Hct Drop: Cardiac cath was c/b significant
oozing at the femoral insertion site and the pt's Hct dropped to
23 immediately post cath. She was transfused 2U pRBCs with an
appropriate response, and her Hct at the time of discharge was
stable at 32. She
