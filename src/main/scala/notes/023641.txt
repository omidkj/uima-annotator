Pertinent Results:
[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
Intra-op TEE [**2127-6-27**]
PREBYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium
is dilated. The left ventricular cavity is dilated. There is
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis in the LAD distribution; LVEF = 20-25%.. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Mild descending thoracic aortic
atherosclerosis. Intact IAS. No clot seen in LAA. Normal
coronary sinus.

POSTBYPASS: Improved LV systolic function. Improved wall motion
in area of LAD distribution. Otherwise uncanged. No dissection
seen after cannula removed.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2127-6-27**] Mr.[**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room and underwent
Coronary artery bypass grafting x2 (left internal mammary artery
to the left anterior descending artery and reverse saphenous
vein graft to the obtuse marginal artery) with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
CROSS-CLAMP TIME:  54 minutes.PUMP TIME:  66 minutes. Please see
operative report for further surgical details. He tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable but
critical condition. He awoke neurologically intact and was
weaned to extubation. He weaned off pressor support and was
started on beta-blocker, Statin, aspirin and diuresis. All lines
and drains were discontinued per protocol. CXR post chest tube
removal revealed right moderate pneumothorax. Serial CXRs showed
resolution of the right pneumothorax. POD#1 he was transferred
to the step down unit for further monitoring and recovery.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility.  Postoperatively his rhythm went into rapid atrial
fibrillation requiring Amiodarone drip. He converted to normal
sinus rhythm. The remainder of his postoperative course was
uneventful. By POD4 he was cleared for discharge to home with
VNA services. All follow up appointments were advised.
