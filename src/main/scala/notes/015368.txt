Brief Hospital Course:
#.ANOREXIA/MODERATE MALNUTRITION: Patient initially admitted for
PEG placemen. Tube feeds were advanced to a goal of 45cc/hr on
[**2132-8-9**]. Abdominal pain and nausea slowly resolved. Diet
advanced to full liquids on [**2132-8-10**].
.
#.Dyspnea: On the floor, patient became acutely dyspneic on the
morning of [**2132-8-10**], thought to be [**12-24**] pulmonary edema in the
setting of IVF. Pt received Hydralazine 10mg IV x 2, 2 inches of
nitropaste, Lasix 20mg IV x 1, and Cefepime with improvement in
her blood pressure and dyspnea. She was weaned from 5L of O2 to
RA by 5pm. CXR was read as asymmetric pulmonary edema vs.
multifocal pneumonia. On [**8-11**], the patient had a similar episode
of acute shortness of breath.  Her BP was >200/100.  She again
receive hydralazine, nitropaste and lasix.  Though her BP came
down to 180s she was unable to wean from 02 and required NRB.
She was transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress.  She
was initially managed on non-invasive positive pressure
ventilation.  However, she had icreasing work of breathing,
rising CO2 and was intubated for respiratory failure.  CT of the
lungs showed new multifocal pneumonia on top of the patient's
existing cavitary lung disease.  The patient was initially
treated with Vanco/Cefepime/Cipro and she was continued on her
home regimen of linezolid/azithromycin for her mycobaterium
abscessus.  Sputum culture and mini-BAL grew pseudomonas and the
patient was continued on Cefepime/Cipro.  The patient's
pneumonia initially did not clinically improve (no improvement
in ventilation and worsening in imaging).  Repeat sputum
cultures grew pseudomonas that was intermediate sensitivity to
cefepime and ID was consulted.  The patient was then switched to
meropenem and inhaled tobramycin for a planned 21 day course.
The patient's respiratory status clinically improved over the
next week and she was weaned from the ventilator.  A family
meeting was held on [**8-25**] to decide about goals of care and
future need for tracheostomy.  The patient's primary
pulmonologist, primary infectious disease doctor, ICU team, case
manager, husband and daughter were all present.  The patient was
intubated but not sedated.  A decision was made to extubate the
patient, make her DNR/DNI and send her home with hospice care.
After extubation the patient remained with 02 sats >90% on 5-6L
02.  Her meropenem and inhaled tobramycin were stopped on
discharge.
.
#Hypotension: Thought [**12-24**] sepsis/pneumonia and sedation. Patient
became hypotensive peri-intubation and levophed was started to
maintain MAPs>65.  Access was initially difficult so a femoral
line was initially placed.  This was replaced by a central line
the next morning.  A line was also placed.  The patient required
levophed intermittently during the first week she was intubated.
 As her infection was treated and her sedation was weaned off,
the patient was able to maintain her blood pressure on her own
and became hypertensive.  She required fluid boluses on 2
mornings for MAPs<65 and she responded quickly. She was started
back on a lower dose of her hydralazine which was titrated up
throughout her ICU stay.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Pt's creatinine increased to a peak of
1.3 on [**2132-8-9**]; she was started on IVF with resolution of her
renal failure. IVF were stopped on [**2132-8-10**] due to acute dyspneic
episode, and electrolytes and creatinine remained stable.
.
# MYCOBACTERIAL ABSCESSUS INFECTION: Pt was continued on
Linezolid/Azithromycin throughout her hospital stay.  Her
primary infectious disease doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Name (NI) 653**] and agreed with
this plan.  She will continue these medications on discharge.
