Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD removal, ICD lead removal


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 85460**] is a 69M with h/o CABG, HTN, HL, ischemic
cardiomyopathy, PAF, bioprosthetic AVR, s/p ICD in [**2105**] changed
to BiV in [**2107**] presenting with worsening ICD infection. He notes
that he has had chronic swelling/hematoma and occasional redness
over the past 4 years but does not recall being treated for any
infection in the past.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] evacuated the hematoma
on [**2109-10-11**]; culture of the pocket grew coag negative staph and
the patient was placed on Keflex TID x 6 wks per ID recs. Over
the past 1.5-2 wks the patient notes that the swelling over his
ICD has worsened and has become more erythematous and tender
despite taking his Keflex regularly. He denies any recorded
fevers, but notes he has been feeling 'warm' at home
occasionally over the past [**3-13**] wks. He also notes a sharp [**3-20**]
pain that radiates down from his ICD site along the left side of
his chest on occasion during the same time period. This pain is
not exertional and is not associated with SOB or diaphoresis; he
notes that it is not like the angina he has had in the past. He
was admitted from home per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] for IV abx
management and closer monitoring.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent documented fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
[**2109-11-21**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the left
pacemaker has been removed. The leads have also been removed.
.
Newly placed PICC line over the right upper extremity. The tip
of the line
projects over the mid SVC. There is no evidence of complication,
notably no pneumothorax. Unchanged minimal retrocardiac
atelectasis. No evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
pneumonia. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Moderate
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
69M with h/o CABG, HTN, HL, ischemic cardiomyopathy, PAF,
bioprosthetic AVR, s/p ICD in [**2105**] changed to BiV in [**2107**]
presenting with worsening ICD infection s/p ICD and lead
extraction on [**11-19**].
.
# ICD infection: Longstanding ICD infection after placement in
[**2105**]; s/p hematoma evacuation 5 wks ago, pocket tissue noted to
be friable. Swelling and erythema worsened over the past 2 weeks
prior to presentation, evidence of cellulitis. s/p ICD and lead
extraction on [**2109-11-19**], pt has remained hemodynamically stable,
afebrile, no signs of systemic infection. Will treat with
vancomycin 1000mg q12H, ciprofloxacin 500mg [**Hospital1 **], Flagyl 500mg
TID for a total of 2 wks per ID (day 1 = [**2109-11-20**]. Of note,
patient developed red man syndrome after 1st dose of vancomycin;
please administer at 1/2 rate (100mg/hr) and administer
diphenhydramine and Zofran as needed. Has been tolerating vanc
at reduced rate without issues after 1st dose. No evidence of
valvular vegetations on TEE prior to surgery. Unfortunately, no
deep tissue cultures taken at time of ICD removal, will be
treating empirically for GNR found on tissue swab 5 weeks ago.
PICC line placement confirmed by CXR: RUE, tip of line over the
mid SVC. Penrose drain placed during surgery was pulled prior to
discharge; stitches will be removed in 1 wk during cardiology
follow-up.
.
# CORONARIES: Known CAD, s/p NSTEMI, CABG. Denied CP, SOB
throughout entire admission. Patient was bradycardic and
hypotensive s/p ICD removal, which was expected as the patient
was pacer dependent prior to the ICD extraction. Continue ASA
81mg daily, continue reduced doses of Toprol XL 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
# PUMP: LVEF of 30-35% on recent ECHO and mild aortic stenosis.
Evidence of minimal fluid overload on exam. Continue home
regimen at reduced doses as pt relatively bradycardic and
hypotensive s/p ICD and lead removal. Cont spironolactone
12.5mg, metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril 10mg daily. Continue
home lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
# RHYTHM: History of PAF, s/p BiV ICD placement and ICD
extraction [**3-12**] ICD pocket infection. Pt in sinus rhythm on day
of discharge, rates in 50s-60s with first degree AVB and BBB,
rare PVCs.  Continue digoxin 0.125mg daily. Continue to hold
anti-coagulation as pt is not in a-fib, will re-eval for need
for anticoagulation at follow-up cards appt.
.
# HTN: BP 111/54 on AM of discharge. Cont home regimen at
reduced doses as stated above (lisinopril, spironolactone,
toprol XL).
.
# Acute renal insufficiency: Cr 1.3 on day of discharge, 1.1 on
admission. Likely [**3-12**] poor PO fluid intake, recent NPO status
for surgery; will have obtain follow-up blood work to monitor.
We encouraged increasing PO fluid intake on day of discharge.
.
#Shoulder Pain: Resolving, likely [**3-12**] vaccination given in L
deltoid; ROM has improved, minimal concern for ICD infection
spreading to joint.
.
# HL: Recent lipid panel [**2109-9-26**] - chol 165, TG 158, HDL 42, LDL
91. Continued atorvastatin.
.
# COPD: Pt notes that breathing has improved since quitting
smoking. Continued Singulair, Advair and albuterol prn.
.
# Chronic back pain: continue home regimen lexapro, gabapentin.
Meloxican held during admission.
.
# Restless leg syndrome: Continued pramipexole.
.
# OSA: Please continue patient on CPAP (home machine to be
brought to ECF, please use home setting of 25cm H2)

Medications on Admission:
Metoprolol Succ 200mg daily
Warfarin 2.5-7mg daily
