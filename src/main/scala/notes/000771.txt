from c diff colitis.  Given CXR with consolidation v atelectasis

#Acute on chronic systolic CHF: On hospital day #3 pt became
hypoxic after blood transfusion (receives chronic transfusions
for anemia assoc w/ MGUS), transferred to ICU for monitoring,
did not require intubation; managed well with IV lasix daily.

# Delerium: Multifactorial, hypercalcemia, sepsis, and finally
from dexamethosone treatment for multiple myeloma; resolved with
