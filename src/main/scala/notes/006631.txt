Pertinent Results:
[**2142-11-6**] Intra-op TEE:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). with normal free wall
contractility.

The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.

The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
prolapse of the septal tricuspid leaflet. Mild 1+ tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.

There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at the time of
the study

POSTBYPASS:
The patient is AV paced on low dose phenylephrine infusion.
There is a well seated mechanical prosthetic valve in the aortic
position.Mechanical leaflet excursion is appropriate. Signature
washing jets noted. Peak and mean gradients are 16mmHg & 6mmHg,
respectively. The remaining valves are unchanged. Biventricular
funtion is maintained. The aorta remains intact.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission she went to the Operating Room where a valve
replacement was performed.  Please see the operative note for
details.  She weaned from bypass
easily and was traported to the ICU. She awoke intact, was
weaned from the ventilator and extubated the afternoon of
surgery.

Beta blocker was begun as was diuresis towards her periperative
weight. Mediastinal tubes were removed on post-operative one as
there was insignificant drainage and no air leak. The follow up
chest radiograph revealed a 50% right pneumothorax for which a
24Fr CT was placed with reexpansion of the lung. There was an
air leak after placement.  Chest tube was clamped for 24 hours
without change in pneumothorax and chest tube was removed on
POD#4. Chest XRAY was stable after CT removal.

She had a brief episode of Afib and converted after IV amio. Her
betablocker was increased and she was transitioned to po amio.

Coumadin was begun for the mechanical valve. Physical Therpy was
consulted for strength and mobility assistance. Aggressive
bronchdilator and her routine pulmonary medications were
continued.

INR rose quickly after initiation of coumadin.  Her atrial
pacing wires were discontinued in the usual fashion.  The
V-wires were cut at the skin.
