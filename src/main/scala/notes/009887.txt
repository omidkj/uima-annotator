CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hematemesis

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 70-year-old
male nursing home resident, transferred from [**Hospital3 2558**]
Nursing Home for evaluation of coffee-ground emesis and
hypotension.

The patient was in his usual state of health until the day of
admission, when he vomited coffee grounds in the morning.  He
also had tarry stools all day.  The patient was noted by the
nursing staff to have a blood pressure of 50/30, and was
tachycardic, with a heart rate of 120.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
emergent evaluation.

In the Emergency Department here, blood pressure was 70/palp,
heart rate 130.  His hematocrit was 15.9, which was down from
31.6 on [**4-27**], and had an INR of 1.8.  The patient was given
fresh frozen plasma and endoscopy was done in the Emergency
Department.  Endoscopy showed blood in the stomach with
arteriovenous malformations at the lesser curvature, which
were actively oozing.  The patient had BICAP with successful
hemostasis.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit for monitoring after his esophagogastroduodenoscopy
and BICAP.  He was comfortable on transfer to the Intensive
Care Unit.  He stated he was feeling well prior to the day of
admission.  He denied any fevers, chills, abdominal pain,
chest pain, shortness of breath, or dysuria.  He confirmed
his Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate status at the time of
admission.  He received two units of packed red blood cells
and one unit of fresh frozen plasma in the Emergency
Department.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Coronary artery disease
3.  Status post cerebrovascular accident with residual
left-sided weakness
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
5.  Seizure disorder
6.  Urinary retention

ALLERGIES:   The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Multivitamin
2.  Remeron 7.5 mg by mouth daily at bedtime
3.  Dilantin 200 mg by mouth once daily
4.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily
5.  Atrovent nebulizers every six hours as needed
6.  Albuterol nebulizers every six hours as needed
7.  Flomax 0.4 mg by mouth once daily

10. Isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg by mouth three times a day
11. Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily
12. Folic acid 1 mg by mouth once daily
13. Monopril 30 mg by mouth once daily
14. Neurontin 600 mg by mouth three times a day

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives at [**Hospital3 2558**].  He
does not drink alcohol.  He does not smoke cigarettes
currently.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature was 100.4,
heart rate 119, blood pressure 134/35, oxygen saturation 100%
on room air.  In general, the patient was a cachectic,
elderly male in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat:  Very dry mucous membranes, extraocular movements
intact.  There is a left-sided facial droop.  The lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart was
tachycardic, with a regular rhythm.  There were no murmurs.
The abdomen was soft, minimal right upper quadrant
tenderness.  The liver was 3 to 4 cm below the costal margin.
The extremities showed no edema.  A right groin line was in
place.  Neurological examination showed the patient to be
awake and alert.  He was answering questions appropriately.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, white count was 8.1,
hematocrit 15.9, platelets 270, differential 73% neutrophils,
20% lymphocytes.  Sodium 150, potassium 3.5, chloride 117,
bicarbonate 18, BUN 78, creatinine 0.6, glucose 89.  CK was
25 with a troponin less than 0.3.  Calcium 6.4, phosphate
3.3, magnesium 1.6.  Urinalysis was negative.

IMAGING STUDIES:  A chest x-ray was done which showed linear
opacities in the left retrocardiac region, compatible with
resolving lower lobe collapse.  Aspiration could not be
excluded.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   In summary, the patient is a 70-year-old
male with a history of cerebrovascular accident,
hypertension, and coronary artery disease, who presented with
an upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastric
arteriovenous malformations.  He had successful cauterization
of the bleeding vessels, and was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for continued fluid resuscitation, blood
transfusions, and additional monitoring.

1. Gastrointestinal:  As already stated, the patient was
found to have gastric arteriovenous malformations, which were
successfully BICAPped.  He initially received Protonix
intravenously twice a day.  This was eventually changed to
Protonix by mouth twice a day.  He had no further episodes of
nausea, vomiting or acute bleeding after his initial
presentation.  He received a total of four units of packed
red blood cells for his initial anemia.  At the time of this
discharge summary, he appears stable from a bleeding
standpoint.

The patient was noted also to have elevated liver enzymes at
the time of admission, with an AST of 392, an ALT of 255 and
alkaline phosphatase of 148.  This was felt to most likely be
secondary to "shock" liver secondary to the hypotension in
the setting of the gastrointestinal bleed.  His liver enzymes
peaked on the third hospital day, with his AST peaking at
1510, and his ALT peaking at 1233.  On the day of this
discharge summary, [**5-20**], the liver function tests are now
trending down, with his AST at 630 and his ALT at 983.  His
alkaline phosphatase is 182.  He does not have any
significant right upper quadrant tenderness on examination.
He is having no nausea or vomiting.

2.  Cardiovascular:  As noted, the patient was initially
hypotensive secondary to acute blood loss.  After admission,
his blood pressure quickly improved with fluid resuscitation
and packed red blood cells.  Initially his blood pressure
medications were held but, as his blood pressure improved,
his blood pressure medications were restarted.  At the time
of this discharge summary, his Cardizem and Isordil have been
restarted, with blood pressures in the 150s/70s.  His
Monopril will be restarted on [**5-21**], given that his blood
pressures are still somewhat elevated.  His aspirin was held
throughout his hospital stay given his recent
gastrointestinal bleed.  He had no episodes of chest pain
throughout the hospital stay.

3.  Hematology:  The patient was severely anemic at the time
of admission secondary to acute blood loss.  As already
stated, he received a total of four units of packed red blood
cells, with appropriate bump in his hematocrit.  At the time
of this discharge summary, his hematocrit is 33.7.  In
addition to his anemia, the patient also had a coagulopathy
at the time of admission, with an INR of 1.8.  The patient
received vitamin K and two units of fresh frozen plasma.  The
exact etiology of his coagulopathy is not known.  It may be,
in part, secondary to his acute liver dysfunction as well as
an element of malnutrition, given that his albumin was only
2.8.  At the time of this discharge summary, his INR is 1.4.
We are rechecking the INR on the morning of discharge, and
may give additional vitamin K if the INR appears to be
increasing.

4.  Infectious Disease:  The patient had no evidence of
infection until the third hospital day, when his temperature
began to rise.  He was noted to have his urine culture
growing gram-negative rods.  This was assumed to be the
etiology of his fever, and he was started on Cipro initially.
He then spiked to 101.2 on the afternoon of [**5-19**].  Blood
cultures were drawn at that time, and the patient was
switched from Cipro to Levaquin to add some gram-positive
coverage.  The patient's blood cultures have remained
negative, but the patient's groin line, which was pulled at
the time of his temperature spike on the 24th, has been noted
to be growing 15 colonies of staphylococcus aureus.  At the
time of this discharge summary, the sensitivities of the
staphylococcus are unknown.  The patient has had no further
spikes on the Levaquin at this time.  If the patient is to
spike again, he will be switched to vanco
