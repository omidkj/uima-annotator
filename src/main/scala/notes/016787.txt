History of Present Illness:
56F with hx of HTN, DM, CHF EF 10-15%, COPD, former 1 PPD
smoker-quit [**2179**], asthma, obesity admitted to CCU for treatment
of pulmonary edema. Initially presented on [**8-5**] to [**Hospital1 1474**] ER
with acute SOB on progressive DOE, orthopnea, and LE edema x 2
wks. Intubated in [**Hospital1 1474**] ER for impending respiratory failure.
Chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema. Enzymes negative x 3. Stat
echo performed: LVH, hypokinesis-akinesis of basal to mid
portion of inferior wall. EF 15-20%, apical septal akinesis.
Patient had ETT [**10/2183**] showing small area of inferior ischemia.
In the ER patient was given 100mg IV Lasix and started on
nitroglycerin drip. She diuresed well. Quickly weaned and
extubated within 24 hours. Nitroglycerin was stopped. Started on
captopril, lovenox, ASA, lopressor. On HD #1 was found sitting
in chair slumped over (telemetry showed v fib) pt reintubated,
shocked 200, 200, 300, BP remained stable, went into sinus
bradycardia 30-40's then converted into Afib 90-100 and
amiodarone drip was initiated, Mg repleted. Transfered to [**Hospital1 **] for

CXR [**2187-8-7**] Cardiomegaly with CHF. Likely bilateral lower lobe
atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded in both lower
lobes.

CATH [**2187-8-8**]
The LMCA, LAD, and LCX were without angiographically-apparent,
flow-limiting disease.  The LAD was a large caliber vessel with
its most distal portion wrapping
around to partially supply the posterior wall.  The RCA
contained a mid
vessel, discrete 50% stenosis.  It was otherwise without
apparent disease.
Resting hemodynamics:
RA mean 7, RV 43/12, PA 43/21/30, PCWP mean 17, LV 136/30, aorta
136/80/102
CO 6.0, CI 2.6, SVR 1267, PVR 173
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated left sided filling pressures.

ECHO [**2187-8-9**]
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection
fraction
20-25%). The aortic root is moderately dilated. There is no
aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no
pericardial effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to CCU due to CHF/pulmonary edema in
context of hyperentsion.

1. Pulm Edema - Patient was treated with diuresis with IV Lasix.
She diuresed 5L in two days. She initially required supplimental
oxygen but when her volume status improved, she was able to come
off oxygen. Her chest X-ray done on HD #2 showed resolving
pulmonary edema. The patient had been started initially on
Nipride drip for hypertension. Nipride was weaned and her BPs
were controlled with Captopril that was gradually titrated up.
She was then placed on spironolactone, low-dose Carvedilol, and
lasix 20 mg po a day for decompensated heart failure.

2. CHF- non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20-25%. The work up for
the etiology of cardiolmyopathy in this patient included iron
studies, TSH and free T4, [**Doctor First Name **], and HIV all of which were
unrevealing. Her cardiomyopathy was felt to be secondary to
diabetes. Specifically, her HIV test was negative. (HIV results
were not back at the time of the patient discharge. She was
instructed prior to discharge to follow up with her primary care
physician regarding her HIV test result. Attempts to reach the
patient by phone to give her the results were unsuccessful.)
Patient had been kept even on her I/Os. She was started on
Captopril and later changed to Lisinopril 20 mg po qd. She was
also discharted on Toprol 25 mg po qd, spironolactone, and Lasix
20 mg po qd.

3. CAD - The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**8-8**]
after her respiratory status had improved and she was able to
lye flat. Angiogram showed one vessel non-flow limiting disease.
The patient was started on statin, ASA, ACE inhibitor, and a low
dose beta blocker, given her cardiomyopathy. Her lipid panel
came back: Chol 192, Trig 108, HDL 60, LDL 110. She had a mild
elevation of ALT thought to be secondary to steatohepatitis. She
will follow up of her liver function tests as an outpatient and
will need monitoring of liver function while on lipitor.

3. Rhythm - Rhythm strips were obtained from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
for review and confirmed that she had an episode of v fib at
OSH. Dual chamber defibrillator was placed on [**8-10**]. The patient
tolerated the procedure well. She received post-procedure
Vancomycin x 4 doses and was discharged home on Clindamycin 300
mg 2 po tid x 6 doses. She will follow up with device clinic.
She will have her Mg and K checked in about 3 days after
discharge. The results will be called to her primary care
physician.

4. Asthma - The patient was continued on nebulizers while she
was admitted. She had no wheezing during her hospital stay.

5. Microcytosis with hypochromasia - Iron studies were not
suggestive of iron deficiency. Thalassemia minor is also on a
differential for this asymptomatic patient of African descent
with microcytosis. Blood smear was sent for hemepath review and
revealed no target cells. She will follow up with her primary
care physician and hemoglobin electrophoresis could be
