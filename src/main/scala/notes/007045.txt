Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was found to have pneumonia complicated by empyema.  He
underwent VATS procedure and left decortication.  He was
transferred to the MICU with chest tubes x 2 for drainage of
empyema.  The chest tubes were eventually removed and patient
was extubated.  Upon extubation family decided that patient
would be DNI/DNR and no tracheostomy.  In the MICU patient was
kept on morphine drip for respiratory comfort.  Upon ICU
admission patient was hypotensive/septic with multi-pressors
needed.  He improved with after initial resuscitation with LR
and eventually was weaned off pressors.  Patient was found to
have Strep Milleri in pleural fluid and MRSA in sputum.  He was
initially treated with vancomycin and Zosyn, which was then
switched to Zosyn and linezolid and finally put on a 28 day
course of linezolid.  Neurology was consulted since patient with
Parkinson's disease.  He was given Mirapex, Sinemet, and
Vitamins for his parkinsonian symptoms.  Patient was transferred
to the floor off morphine drip but still requiring morphine prn
because he showed obvious signs of discomfort which was relieved
by the morphine.  Once on the floor it was decided that patient
should be restarted on the morphine drip.  Patient never was
awake or alert upon transfer to the floor.  Once on the floor
patient's condition gradually worsened.  Palliative care was
consulted and there was a family meeting to discuss the further
goals of treatment for the patient.  The family was in agreement
that they would not want any aggressive therapy but their goal
now was to hopefully have the patient wake up before he passed
away.  In an effort to accomplish this, the morphine drip was
reduced.  However prn morphine order was still in effect if
patient in a lot of discomfort which he demonstrated with
shaking and slashing which was different than his Parkinson's.
Patient eventually passed away at night with his family members
present.
