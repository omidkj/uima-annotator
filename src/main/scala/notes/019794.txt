Chief Complaint:
angina/? aortic aneurysm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
84 yo female with several episodes of chest pain since the AM.
Went to [**Hospital3 **] and was found to have mental status
changes with a right facial droop. Head CT was negative but
non-contrast chest CT showed an aortic arch aneurysm. No TEE
performed at [**Hospital1 487**] as pt. was hypotensive. Scan also showed a
pleural effusion. ? GI bleed at OSH. TTE there showed no
pericardial effusion. Transferred by Med-Flight to ER here for
further evaluation.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2144-5-25**] 5:23 PM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-

Reason: eval for thoracic AD/aneurysm
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old woman with ?aneursym on CT from OSH, had Cp and R
facial/arm weakness, equivocal TTE. Has CRI, pt aware of risk to
kidneys with contrast, agrees to study
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for thoracic AD/aneurysm
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CTA CHEST

INDICATION: 84-year-old woman with aortic aneurysm.

COMPARISON: Not available.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the chest were obtained prior to
and following administration of 100 cc of Optiray intravenously.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.

CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The study is
compared to an OSH NECT obtained several hours earlier. Again
demonstrated is a large saccular aneurysm, involving and
essentially limited to the aortic arch, measuring 8.6 x 6.1 cm.
The appearance of the aneurysmal wall is very irregular, though
only minimally calcified, and it involves origins of left common
carotid and left subclavian arteries, with the brachiocephalic
trunk apparently arising just anterior to the anterior aspect of
the aneurysm (best demonstrated on the reformations). There is
small amount of atherosclerotic plaque involving the arch of the
aorta. No active extravasation of contrast is noted at the time
of the study. There is no dissection. There is a large left
hemothorax.

There is no pericardial effusion. There is no evidence of
pulmonary embolism.

Central airways are patent to the segmental levels bilaterally.
There is extensive compression atelectasis of the left lung.
Small right effusion is also present. The right lung is clear.
There are no pathologically enlarged mediastinal, axillary, or
hilar lymph nodes.

BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions. Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION: Large and very irregular saccular aneurysm,
essentially limited to the arch of the aorta, and take-offs of
the left common carotid and subclavian arteries, while sparing
the brachiocephalic trunk. No active extravasation is
demonstrated at this time. Large left hemothorax, consistent
with prior rupture or leak. The constellation is suggestive of
mycotic aneurysm.

Findings were reviewed in detail, in-person with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(Cardiothoracic Surgery) immediately following completion of the
study.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old woman work-up for aortic arch aneurysm
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pleural effusions
CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: Follow up.

There are no previous radiographs for comparison.

There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with
moderate displacement of the mediastinum towards the
contralateral hemithorax. This finding suggests massive fluid
accumulation in the left hemithorax. On the left, no ventilated
lung parenchyma is seen. On the left, the mediastinal structures
are not seen. In the right lung, there are no abnormalities, no
focal parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.

Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2144-5-28**] 10:41 PM








Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted and underwent CT with contrast which showed a 6 cm arch
aneursym with no extravasation, and a left pleural effusion. Pt.
stated she did not want surgery and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed this
with her sons. She was deemed to be exceedingly high risk for a
complex aortic operation. Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] were consulted
about the possible option of endo stent-grafting with
re-implantation of the arch vessels. She was not a candidate for
stenting either, and medical management with tight BP control in
the CVICU was the option chosen. She was weaned to oral agents
and transferred to the floor on [**5-27**]. Left chest tube was placed
on [**5-28**] for hemothorax drainage. On [**5-29**], she acutely developed
respiratory distress and was unable to clear her secretions. She
was transferred to the CVICU emergently where she was noted to
have a large amount of frank blood draining from the left chest
tube.
Plan was not to perform prolonged resuscitatation per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. She expired at 1:45 AM.
