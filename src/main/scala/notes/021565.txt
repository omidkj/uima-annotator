Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory arrest, acute COPD exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and extubation
Central line placement and removal

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68yo F with history of COPD who reportedly had
cough and runny nose and called EMS.  She developed dyspnea
while in the ambulance and required LMA for respiratory support.
 She became pulseless and CPR was initiated for approximately 30
seconds before she regained spontaneous circulation.  No shocks
or medications were administered.

In the ED, patient was emergently intubated with etomidate and
succinylcholine.  She was moving all 4 extremities prior to
sedation.  She then became hypotensive and was started on
levophed through a R IJ central line. Patient was given
fentanyl/versed for sedation and started on vanc/zosyn. Her EKG
showed sinus rhythm at 77 with cor pulmonale but no ST changes.
The post-arrest team was consulted and recommended against
cooling given short period of pulselessness.  Blood cultures
were drawn after initiation of antibiotics, and she received 5
liters of IVF. Vitals on transfer were 74, 141/56 on
0.05mcg/kg/min, 20, AC 450x20, 100%, 5 PEEP.

In the ICU, she was intubated and sedated. Her ICU course was
significant for subsequent extubation, steroids and completion
of antibiotic course. She had no significant delirium following
extubation, but did note persistent dyspnea and hypoxia.

Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:
.
STUDIES:
CXR [**2149-5-10**]:
FINDINGS: Single supine AP portable view of the chest was
obtained.
Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4 cm above
the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen, coursing
below the level of the
diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the stomach.
The lungs are clear relatively hyperinflated, with relative
lucency in the upper lobes, suggesting chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
definite pneumothorax is seen. Two curvilinear opacities
projecting over the left upper lobe and right lung apex are not
present on subsequent imaging at 20:20 the same day. Cardiac and
mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
.
CT [**2149-5-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intrathoracic process.
2. Severe pulmonary emphysema, with multiple nodules and
extensive scarring.  Recommend correlation to prior imaging; if
unavailable, followup CT in [**7-6**] months is recommended.
3. Nasogastric tube terminates at the GE junction; recommend
advancement so that it is well within the stomach.
3. Severe atheromatous disease, with probable chronic mesenteric
ischemia.
.
CT HEAD W/O [**2149-5-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Mild paranasal sinus disease.
.
CXR [**2149-5-12**]:
FINDINGS:

There is an endotracheal tube in situ, the tip of which is
approximately 3.5 cm proximal to the carina. The heart and
mediastinal contours are within normal limits. There is no acute
consolidation. No pleural effusion is seen. Coarse lung markings
are seen in addition to hyperinflation suggesting COPD.  A
nasogastric tube is noted, the tip of which is below the
diaphragm. There is a right internal jugular central venous
catheter, the tip of which projects over the SVC.

IMPRESSION: No acute consolidation. Support hardware is as
outlined above.
.
CXR [**2149-5-13**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia. Little
interval change.
.
CXR [**2149-5-14**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-13**], the endotracheal
tube has
been pulled back to approximately 4 cm above the carina.
Continued
hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary
disease.
Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some superimposed
elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68yo F with history of COPD here after cardiac
arrest likely in setting of respiratory failure and acidosis. Pt
was cared for in the MICU where she was intubated. Her HD status
was monitored, and she required brief pressors. She was treated
initially with broad spectrum abx given hypotension and concern
for PNA on top of COPD exacerbation. Pt was initially extubated
on HOD#2, but had increasing agitation and did not tolerate
BIPAP and was reintubated. Reintubation was complicated by
hypotension likely [**2-26**] propofol induction, requiring pressors.
Abx were tailored to CTX for haemophilus in the sputum for
planned 10 day course. She was continued on steroids with a
taper. She was re-extubated on HOD
