Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 39F with past medical history significant
for Auto Immune Hepatitis, portal hypertension,  splenomegaly,
and hepatopulmonary syndrome requiring home O2. She was admitted
[**2120-7-2**] for a liver transplant, and subsequently underwent
surgery where she received an ABO incompatible liver, and had a
splenectomy. On POD#1 it was noted that she had biliary drainage
from [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] drain and there was concern for bile duct [**Last Name (LF) 3564**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
the patient was taken back to the OR for an ex-lap,
choledochocholedochostomy. She tolerated the procedure well and
was monitored in the SICU until she was stable for transfer on
[**2120-7-11**].  In regards to her immunosuppression, the patient
received MMF, methylprednisolone to prednisone taper,
Tacrolimus, and ATG per ABO incompatible liver transplant
protocol. Tacrolimus levels were monitored daily and adequate
suppression was achieved (most recent tacro levels ranging
[**9-21**]). Initially the patient was checked for Anti-A and Anti-B
titers. Throughout her hospital course patient was pheresed a
total of 12 times for elevated titers, which was continued when
the patient was transferred to the floor. Due to the history of
hepatopulmonary syndrome, the patient has continued to require
oxygen by face mask. Throughout her course she has been able to
maintain good sats on face mask, but decompensates into the 80's
upon ambulation. This was consistent with her initial baseline,
and she will require supplemental oxygen upon discharge. While
on the floor, her blood sugars were monitored and patient was
managed on an ISS with the help of [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 982**] Clinic.
Through her course serial liver enzymes were monitored, and
AST/ALT levels remained stable. Recently on [**2120-7-20**] there was a
bump in the Alk Phos 121 up to 171 on [**2120-7-24**]. A Liver US was
performed which demonstrated a patent portal vein and branches,
and good flow on the Hepatic artery. An U/S guided liver biopsy
was also performed on [**2120-7-22**] to check for signs of rejection,
the pathology report was negative for signs of acute rejection
or ductal proliferation. Patient remained stable and was set up
for discharge to a rehab facility ([**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 701**]).
