Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Apnea:  Pt became apneic during ICD placement and required
intubation for apnea (likely from sedatives and pre-existing
sleep apnea).  Pt also became hypotensive during propofol
administration, and was given 2L NS.

2.  Volume overload/Acute pul edema:  Pt recieved 2L NS
resucitation for hypotension during intubation.  He then
developed pink, frothy sputum and displayed signs of acute
pulmonary edema.  He is quite fluid sensitive given his EF of
[**9-12**]%.  Pt was diuresed overnight with a IV lasix (40mg X 2 and
80mg X 1) and was successfully extubated on HD#2.  He diuresed a
total of 2L and was then 100% on RA and did not desaturate on
ambulation.  Pt will have CHF nursing dietary education prior to
discharge.  He will f/u with Dr.[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

3.  Hypotension:  The patient became hypotensive during propofol
administaration.  Fluid was given that increased his BP, but
only transiently.  He was also put on neosynephrine for total of
15 minutes and also required levophed for a short time (20
minutes).  Given his history of long-term steroid use and
sarcoidosis, he was given 2 doses of IV hydrocortisone which was
then stopped.  The etiology of his hypotension was likely
vasodilation from propofol.  He did not mount a reflex
tachycardia from this probably because he was beta-blocked from
his carvedilol which he takes at home.  His BP normalized on
HD#2 and his beta blocker and losartan were re-started without
problem.

4.  ICD placement:  Post procedure chest films show the leads to
be in the correct place.  Device deemed to be functional by
J.Conners N.P.

5.  ARF:  Pt's creatinine increased to 1.8 when he was volume
overloaded.  This was likely [**12-30**] decreased forward flow
resulting in pre-renal azotemia.  This corrected with diuresis
and unloading of LV.  Discharge Cr 1.2 (baseline).
