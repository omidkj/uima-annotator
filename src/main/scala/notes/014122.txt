Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
58yo F w/ PMH of diastolic CHF and PAF who presents to ED
tonight after developing SOB. Had been out to dinner w/ friends
and on return home at midnight, felt like she was having another
episode of CHF. Told her husband that she felt like she was
"filling up" again and was brought to ER by husband. En route,
SOB became progressively worse and on arrival in ED, she went
from being tachycardic to bradycardic. She then became cyanotic
and went unresponsive. She was given atropine x2 with
restoration of a normal HR but she was intubated for respiratory
failure.

discomfort; no fatigue, orthopnea, DOE, PND; no dizziness,
lightheadedness, HA; no cough, sore throat, sinus congestion or
URI sx, no fevers or chills; no n/v/d/BRBPR; no dysuria,
hematuria

.
Micro:
[**2151-2-26**]: blood cx NGTD x2
.
Imaging:
ECHO [**2151-2-26**]: Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2151-2-26**]: Comparison with [**2151-2-9**]. The NG tube
extends below the hemidiaphragm. The endotracheal tube is in
satisfactory position above the carina. The cardiac contour is
enlarged. There are diffuse opacities throughout the lungs,
consistent with pulmonary edema. There are also probable
bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema.
.
CXR [**2151-2-26**]: Endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm from the
carina. Nasogastric tube tip is below the borders of the
radiograph. The
heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged. The heart is
within normal limits in size. Allowing for lower lung volumes,
the degree of marked pulmonary edema is probably not
significantly changed. There is no pneumothorax. Diffuse hazy
opacity suggests layering bilateral pleural effusions. Note is
made of gaseous distention of the stomach.
.
CXR [**2151-2-26**]: Low lung volumes with perihilar alveolar and
interstitial opacities bilaterally, which have slightly improved
on the short interval study. Endotracheal tube tip in stable
position. NG tube tip in the proximal duodenum. IMPRESSION:
Slight improvement of pulmonary edema on the short interval
followup study.
.
CT head [**2151-2-26**]: No intracranial hemorrhage. There may be mild
effacement of the sulci consistent with early cerebral edema.
.
CXR [**2151-2-28**]: Resolution of the pulmonary edema without signs of
acute
cardiopulmonary process.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2151-3-1**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Severe elevation of right and left filling pressures
consistent with
diastolic dysfunction.
3.  No definitive evidence of constriction but can not exclude.
.
CXR [**2151-3-2**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-26**] and 26:
Pulmonary edema has resolved. Heart size is normal, and there is
no pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 58 year old woman with past medical history of
breast cancer, status post resection, radiation, chemotherapy,
diastolic CHF and PAF, who initially presented in respiratory
failure secondary to CHF exacerbation.
.
Patient initially presented in hypoxic respiratory failure with
radiographic and clinical evidence of flash pulmonary edema.
Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and her
elevated heart rate on presentation, it was believed that her
flash pulmonary edema was due to her atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response.
.
The patient was initially intubated for respiratory support and
diuresed with IV lasix.  The patient was then extubated less
than 24 hours after admission without complication.  The patient
continued to be diuresed with IV lasix PRN to achieve a fluid
goal of 1 liter negative/day throughout her hospital course.
.
Patient's post-extubation was complicated by a low grade fever
spike and a question of infiltrate on CXR, and therefore the
patient was empirically started on antibiotics for aspiration
pneumonia.  However, repeat CXR following further diuresis
demonstrated resolution of any intrapulmonary process and the
antibiotics were discontinued.
.
The patient's heart rate was controlled medically with
metoprolol 50mg TID (changed from her outpatient dose of 75mg
[**Hospital1 **]), which kept the patient in good rate control with heart
rate in 50's and 60's throughout remainder of hospital course.
She was also maintained on her outpatient dose of amiodarone
400mg QD which maintained the patient in normal sinus rhythm
following her initial presentation.
.
Other cardiac work up throughout her hospital course included an
ECHO that demonstrated EF of 55%, diastolic dysfunction, and
could not rule out a wall motion abnormality due to the quality
of the study.  Therefore, the patient proceeded to undergo
cardiac catheterization to evaluate if she had CAD that could
cause her cardiac dysfunction.  The cath demonstrated clean
coronary arteries, severe diastolic dysfunction, no definite
evidence of constrictive physiology.
.
The patient was otherwise maintained on a number of cardiac
medications throughout her hospital course.  These medications
included metoprolol 50mg TID (changed from her outpatient dose
of 75mg [**Hospital1 **]), her outpatient dose of statin, her outpatient dose
of amiodarone, her outpatient dose of coumadin for her atrial
fibrillation (which was held peri-cath), her outpatient ACE I
which was uptitrated as her blood pressure tolerated (and
therefore she was discharged on lisinopril increased from 10mg
QD to 20mg QD), an increased dose of lasix (from
