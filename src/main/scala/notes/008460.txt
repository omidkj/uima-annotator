Chief Complaint:
Ischemic right lower leg with non healing 3rd toe amp site.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2175-8-30**]: Right proximal Superficial femoral artery to mid
Posterior tibial bypass w GSV.


History of Present Illness:
50-year-old diabetic gentleman who presented with gangrene of
his right 3rd toe on [**2175-8-23**] for which he underwent amputation.
Noninvasive arterial studies at that time demonstrated diffuse
tibial disease.  He underwent a diagnostic angiography that
showed severe disease in his below-knee popliteal artery and
tibials with reconstitution of a posterior tibial artery down to
his foot which was not amenable to a catheter based
intervention.  He, therefore, presented today for an SFA to
posterior tibial artery bypass.

Renal Ulrasound [**2175-9-6**]
Simple right renal cyst.  Otherwise unremarkable renal
ultrasound.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2175-8-30**] and
underwent a Prox SFA to mid PT bypass w insitu GSV.  The
procedure was without complications.

His postoperative course was complicated by the following:

CARDIAC:
On POD 1, the patient c/o nausea and received a cardiac work-up,
including enzymes and an EKG. The EKG showed no change from
previous, and enzymes were stable (Trop .02, MB 2.)

RENAL:
Post-operatively, the patient was noted to have a creatinine of
3.4, having been discharged a week earlier with a normal
creatinine.  The renal service was consulted.  The rise in
creatinine was likely due to ATN caused by lisinopril,
ibuprofen, bactrim and volume depletion in the period between
prior discharge and surgery.  Fluid balance and diet was
carefully managed, and the patient's creatinine improved with
time to 2.1 at discharge.  He is scheduled to follow up with his
PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2175-9-11**] for repeat renal function and electrolytes.  WE
HAVE HELD HIS LISINOPRIL, PRESCRIBED FOR CHF,  SECONDARY TO HIS
KIDNEY INJURY WHICH WILL NEED TO BE RESTARTED WHEN HIS
CREATININE NORMALIZES.

ID/WOUND.
The patient was initially placed on vanc/cipro/flagyl then
transitioned to oral augmentin to treat his toe amp site for
which he will remain on for one week.  The toe amp site was
debrided at the bedside on [**2175-9-5**]. He and his family will
manage the wound at home with three times daily dressing changes
using wound gel and moist gauze. He was given a heel wedge [**Last Name (un) 21924**]
shoe for ambulation and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one
week.

FEN:
The patient's K was noted to be 5.7 on POD 4, and the patient
was treated with insulin/dextrose, keyaxalate, and calcium
gluconate.  No peaked T waves were observed.   K on discharge
was 4.7.  He was seen by nutrition and instructed on a low
potassium, renal diet.

DIABETES:
He was followed by the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes team for blood sugar
management.  They recently stopped his metformin and started
lantus insulin at HS with humolog with meals as his A1C was 12.7
earlier this month.  His blood sugars have been in good control
while in house.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a bypass surgery on your
right leg to improve the circulation to your right foot and heal
your amputation site.  During your hospitalization, you were
seen by the diabetes doctors [**First Name (Titles) 1023**] [**Last Name (Titles) 21925**] your insulin.  You
were also seen by the kidney doctors because of evidence of some
kidney injury  likely secondary to dehydration, medications and
IV dye from your prior angiogram.  You will need to follow a
renal/low potassium diet until your kidney function improves.
We have arranged for your PCP to check your renal function on
[**2175-9-11**].

You will needed to care for your amputation site as follows:
Wound Gel (DuoDerm Gel) to the wound. Apply small amount three
times per day cover with gauze dressing.

It is important that the area remains moist but not wet or be
allowed to dry out.
