CT Abdomen report from [**Location (un) 620**]:
FOCAL WALL THICKENING OF THE LARGE BOWEL AT THE RECTOSIGMOID
JUNCTION. NEOPLASTIC DISEASE CANNOT BE EXCLUDED AND ENDOSCOPIC
CORRELATION IS RECOMMENDED.

EGD ([**7-12**]): Normal esophagus, stomach and duodenum
Colonoscopy ([**7-16**]): A single medium angioectasia was seen in the
cecum which bled with provocation. A gold probe was applied for
tissue destruction successfully.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute GI Bleed. EGD negative. Most likely lower GI source,
especially given history of AVM. Colonoscopy revealed AVM which
bled when provoked. This was cauterized. Hematocrit was
monitored over the 24 hours following the cauterization. The
patient was advised to follow up with a gastroenterologist.

2. Acute blood loss anemia.
Secondary to GI bleeding. The patient was transfused 1 unit
packed RBCs at the OSH and an additional unit in the MICU. He
did not require additional transfusion.

3. ESRD
Secondary to failing transplant for FSGS. On Prograf. Dialyzed
according to home Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday schedule.

4. CAD, CHF, chronic, compensated, systolic and diastolic
ECG without ischemic changes. Aspirin and beta blocker were held
given active bleeding and hypotension. Statin continued.
Discharged on home meds. * was not discharged on ACEI for EF of
40% given documented allergies. Will follow-up with primary care
physician.

5. HTN
Patient was hypotensive initially. His medications were held
initially. Home lasix was restarted on [**7-14**]. Beta blocker was
held and blood pressure regimen kept liberal given risk for
rebleed. He was discharged on home medications.

6. Gout
Home allopurinol continued. Colchicine was discontinued as
patient did not have acute gout and had recent diarrhea.

7. Neuralgia
Secondary to zoster. Pregabalin and fentanyl patch continued.
