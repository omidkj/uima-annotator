are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Focal calcification is present on the left coronary
cusp of the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

aortic
regurgitation. Trace mitral regurgitation is present.
