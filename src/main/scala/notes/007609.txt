Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
CHEST PAIN

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to the left
anterior descending artery


History of Present Illness:
57F w/ HTN, DM, HL, Obesity, pAFIB who presented w/ chief
complaint of chest pain. The patient awoke at 4 PM with SSCP,
band-like feeling across chest and nausea. She tried mylanta and
motrin, but the pain came back. She called 911 by 5pm. She was
brought in by ambulance and threw up all the meds she was given
en-route and went immediately up to lab, without getting off
ambualnce stretcher or stop in ED. She got ASA 325, heparin
5000, and was started on integrillin in lab. She was pain free
before getting on the table. After access through the right
radial, she got ballooned and stented to her LAD. She also had a
distal cut off in the LAD which was not repaired. OM1 was 60%
diseased and not internvened upon. She was transferred to the
CCU afterwards. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout.


On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations.

CATH [**2162-2-11**]:

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel coronary disease. The LMCA was patent.
The LAD
had a 95% proximal occlusion with visible thrombus. The LCX had
an 80%
lesion in the OM1. The RCA had mild disease diffusely.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial
hypertension.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. STEMI
3. GOT DES TO LAD

ECHO [**2162-2-12**]:

The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild apical
aneurysm/dyskinesis and akinesis of the distal inferior wall
(clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The distal septum is also mildly hypokinetic. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (distal
LAD distribution). Mild aortic valve stenosis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-4-10**],
the findings are new.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE: 57 year old female w/ HTN, HL, DM 2, pAFIB who
presented w/ STEMI - got stented to her LAD and admitted to CCU
for post-cath monitoring. Discharged in stable condition.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# STEMI: Pt presented with STE in V1-6 and was found to have an
LAD lesion. She got ballooned and DES to LAD and the procedure
was uneventful. She has an unrepaired distal LAD lesion and a
60% OM1. Pt found to have apical dyskinesises in TTE. CEs were
downtrending. We started asa 325, plavix 75, d/ced pradaxa and
started lovenox bridge until INR therapeutic on warfarin.

# AFIB: Pt has paroxysmal AFIB that was diagnosed last year
after w/u for cholelithiasis. Underwent DCCV and was started on
pradaxa, flecainide, metoprolol. Was last seen in clinic by Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2161-11-16**] at which time she was seen to be doing
well. Was initially started on Sotalol 80 which increased her
QTc to abt 480-500. Dose reduced to 40 [**Hospital1 **] on which qtc was 470
2 hr post dose. We continued warfarin and lovenox bridge

# HTN: BPs in 160s on transfer but stable since call out. We
increased lisinopril to 30 and then d/c on home 40.

# HL: Last lipid panel Chol 286* TG 187*1 HDL 55 LDL calc 194*
in [**2-7**]. We started her on atorva 80 and co enzyme q to prevent
msucle cramps

# DM 2: pt insulin dependant and on metformin. Obesity
increasing. Followed in [**Last Name (un) 387**]. Hba1cs >10. Also has autonomic
neuropathy. We held metformin but kept increasing her insulin
doses. She was on HISS (30, 25, 40 standing) and lantus (45, 50)
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 387**] dosing.

# Asthma: stable. We continued home
