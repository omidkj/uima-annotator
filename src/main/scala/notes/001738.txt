Chief Complaint:
Tracheobronchomalacia, status post stent placement at an outside
hospital.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2149-2-7**]: Flexible bronchoscopy.Therapeutic aspiration of
secretion.
Rigid bronchoscopy Removal of tracheal metal stent
Placement of silicone Y stent with the following measurement:
Tracheal limb 18 x 40 mm, right mainstem limb 10 x 40 mm, left
mainstem limb 15 x 14 mm.
[**2149-2-7**]: Flexible bronchoscopy.
[**2149-2-11**]: Flexible bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
75F h/o OSA, COPD, with multiple intubations secondary to
tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent placed in OSH, with a good
initial response presented to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**]
hospital with increased SOB and respiratory failure.  She was
intubated when she desaturated to the 70s that only improved to
88% on nonrebreather face mask.  Her saturations improved on the
ventilator.  She failed spontaneous breathing trials twice.  She
was found to have MRSA in her sputum and IV vancomycin was
administered.  A CT scan of the neck showed patent stent.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care and possible
intervention.

[**2149-2-7**] MRSA SCREEN      Source: Nasal swab. FINAL REPORT
[**2149-2-8**]**
   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2149-2-8**]):
      POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.

Echocargiogram: [**2149-2-7**] The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 60-70%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: elevated right atrial pressure with normal left and
right ventricular contractile function

CXR:
[**2149-2-10**] Small bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than
left, stable or increased only minimally since [**2-9**]. Upper
lungs clear. Left lower lobe opacification improved since
[**2-8**], probably clearing atelectasis. Upper lungs clear.
Left PIC line passes as far as the upper SVC. Moderate
cardiomegaly improved since [**2-8**]. No pneumothorax.
[**2149-2-8**]: IMPRESSION: Interval development of bibasilar airspace
opacities with small bilateral pleural effusions. Status post
Y-stent placement. Stable cardiomegaly. Stable tube and lines.





Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transerred on [**2149-2-6**] with respiratory
failure on a ventilator. She was continued on IV Vancomycin via
a PICC line placed at the OSH. HD1 she went to the operating for
Flexible bronchoscopy. Therapeutic aspiration of secretion,
Rigid bronchoscopy using a yellow Dumon rigid tracheoscope.
Removal of tracheal metal stent (measured 70 x 20 mm). Placement
of silicone Y stent with the following measurement: Tracheal
limb 18 x 40 mm, right mainstem limb 10 x 40 mm, left mainstem
limb 15 x 14 mm.  She tolerated the procedure was transferred
back to the SICU intubated.  She was started on a steroid taper
for the COPD excerbation and a 5 day course of Azithromax. The
Vancomycin was stopped. She was suctioned and administered
aggressive pulmonary toilet. Gently diuresed with IV lasix. On
POD1 she was extubated.   Her mental status wax and waned upon
initial waking but clear without treatment. Stent maintaince
protocol was started, mucinex 1200 mg [**Hospital1 **], saline nebs q8 and
mucomyst tid.  On POD2 she transferred to the floor clearing her
secretions and with a strong cough.  She was started on a
regular diet with thickened liquids. On POD3 she was gently
diuresed.  Had PFTs done.  On POD4 patient coughed 7cc
serosanguinous fluid.  Patient had bronchoscopy which showed no
leak or bleeding. POD5-7 patient was stable and awaited rehab
placement.  Patient was discharged on POD7 afebrile, tolerating
diet, voiding, having bowel movement and breathing comfortably.
PICC was discontinued.
