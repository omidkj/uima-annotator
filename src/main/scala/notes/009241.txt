Service:  NSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44-year-old
male with one month of complaints of [**8-31**] headache after a
cold that has not resolved but the headache has persisted.
The patient complains of mild neck stiffness, denies any
visual changes, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of
breath.  The patient denies any trauma.  The patient went to
an outside hospital where a lumbar puncture and CT were done.
The lumbar puncture was 34 to 750 red cells in tube number
one and 28,500 in tube number four, with no white cells and a
protein count of 217.  Head CT at the outside hospital, there
is a question of a suprasellar subarachnoid hemorrhage.  The
patient was sent to [**Hospital1 69**]  for
further work-up.  The patient has a negative past medical
history and past surgical history.  No known allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature is 99.4 degrees.
Heart rate 76.  Blood pressure 135/79.  Respiratory rate 14.
Saturations 97 percent on room air.  The patient is a well-
developed, well-nourished, sleepy but arousable gentleman in
no acute distress.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Pupils 4 down to 2
mm and briskly reactive.  Speech is fluent and appropriate.
Repetition and naming intact.  Face is symmetric.  Tongue
midline with no drift.  His strength is 5 out of 5 in all
muscle groups.  His sensation is grossly intact.  His
reflexes are 2 plus throughout except for the ankles which
are 1 plus bilaterally.  His toes are downgoing.  He has no
dysmetria on the right, mild on the left.  He has a positive
Romberg with normal gait.

He was admitted.  Head CT shows hyperdenisty in the right
suprasellar cistern with possible subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, had a
CTA with evidence of a right PICA aneurysm.  He was admitted
to the Intensive Care Unit for close neurological
observation.  He had an angiogram done which showed right
PICA aneurysm which was coiled.  The patient also had diffuse
vasospasm and was then post angiogram sent back to the
Intensive Care Unit for close neurological observation.
Postoperatively, he was extubated, awake, alert and oriented
times three.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular muscles full.  No diplopia.  Strength was [**3-26**] in
all muscle groups.  He had positive pedal pulses and his
groin site was clean, dry and intact with no evidence of
hematoma.  The patient had a vent drain placed at the time of
admission.  Vital signs remained stable.  He, on [**2104-11-10**],
was awake, alert, oriented times three, moving all
extremities with good strength.  His sodium level was low and
he was being repleted with 3 percent saline.  His vital signs
and labs were otherwise within normal limits.

The patient had a repeat head CT on [**2104-11-12**] which showed a
stroke on the right side of the head of the caudate
consistent with obstruction of the artery of Heubner, most
likely representing vasospasm.  The patient was taken to
angio on [**2104-11-12**] after CT showed stroke.  He was found to
have severe vasospasm.  The patient was transferred back to
the Intensive Care Unit and his blood pressure was kept in
the 170 to 190 range.  CVP in the 10 to 12 range.  The
patient was receiving intravenous fluid boluses, albumin as
needed, and continued on a 3 percent saline drip trying to
keep his sodium above 130.

Infectious Disease was consulted on [**2104-11-12**] due to the
persistent fevers of 101 degrees.  The patient's cultures to
date had been negative.  They did not recommend any specific
antibiotic coverage to be started at that point.  The patient
was on prophylaxis for his vent drain.  Infectious Disease
continued to follow the patient.  The patient continued to
spike temperatures to 101.2 degrees.  Infectious Disease felt
that it could be drug fever and recommended changing Dilantin
to another [**Doctor Last Name 360**].

On the  26th the patient had repeat head CT which showed no
change.  The patient had a carotid ultrasound which was
negative and had a chest x-ray after placement of a
subclavian line.  On [**2104-11-18**], the  patient went back to
angio which showed improved angiographic evidence of spasm.
The patient's blood pressure was then wanted to be kept in
the 150 to 180 range and his CVP in the 8 to 10 range.  Post
angio, his vital signs were stable.  He was afebrile.  He was
awake, alert and oriented times three.  He had no hematoma in
his groin.  His pulses were palpable.

On [**2104-11-22**], the patient had been having his drain raised
and on [**2104-11-22**], had a repeat head CT which showed increase
in ventricular size.  The drain was therefore placed back
down at 12 cm.  He spiked on [**2104-11-23**] to 103.8 degrees.
CSF was sent and it came back positive for gram positive
cocci.  Infectious Disease recommended vancomycin and Ceptaz
and repeat cultures and also possibly starting intrathecal
vancomycin.

Pathology was consulted due to his persistently low Dilantin
levels and need for several episodes of re-bolusing.
Neurology recommended starting Keppra and weaning Dilantin
which was done.  The patient was neurologically intact,
awake, alert and oriented times three.  He did have an
episode on [**2104-11-24**] of having left-sided weakness and
somnolence.  Repeat head CT showed no evidence of new stroke
and post CT the patient was more awake and following commands
and moving both right and left sides.  The patient also had
an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure
activity and continued to be followed by Infectious Disease
for a CSF infection.  He also had a transthoracic
echocardiogram which showed no evidence of vegetation in the
heart valves and no clots.

The patient was neurologically stable and transferred to the
Step-Down unit on [**2104-11-29**].  His stay on the floor was
complicated by a continued CSF infection for which he was
treated with vancomycin for two to three weeks.  He also
developed a pulmonary embolism on [**2104-12-1**] and was started
on intravenous heparin.  He remained on intravenous heparin
until he was taken to the Operating Room on [**2104-12-19**] when
he had a VP shunt placed.  Heparin was discontinued prior to
the Operating Room and the patient was started on Lovenox
postoperatively two to three days after surgery.

He remained neurologically intact, awake, alert and oriented
times three, moving all extremities with no drift.  He was
seen by Physical Therapy  and Occupational Therapy and found
to be safe for discharge to home on [**2104-12-23**].

Medications at the time of discharge include Lovenox 70 mg
subcutaneously twice a day, Foltx 1 gm p.o.  three times a
day, Percocet 1 to 2 tabs p.o.  q.4h. p.r.n., ferrous sulfate
325 p.o. once a day, Colace 100 mg p.o.  twice a day, Keppra
1000 mg p.o. twice a day, Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.24h.

The patient's condition was stable at the time of discharge.
He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in two weeks.
