Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath/dizziness/angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2139-12-22**] Coronary artery bypass grafting times one (LIMA>LAD),
aortic valve replacement with a 21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic Porcine


History of Present Illness:
This is a 60 year old female with known aortic stenosis who has
been followed by serial echocardiograms. Her most recent
echocardiogram in [**2139-10-6**] revealed severe aortic stenosis
which had significantly worsened from her last echocardiogram in
[**2139-2-3**]. Recent cath also revealed LAD and CX disease. Given
the progression and severity of her disease, she has been
referred for surgical evaluation. Current symptoms include
dyspnea on exertion and occasional episodes of "burning" in her
chest with exertion. She denies syncope, PND, orthopnea, but has
had c/o dizziness which she has been told is vertigo.
On [**2139-12-22**], she presented for elective CABG and AVR.

Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta. No thoracic aortic
dissection.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Critical AS (area <0.8cm2).

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Written informed consent was obtained from the
patient. A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I
certify I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The
patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PREBYPASS: Severe AS with valve area of 0.7 cm2. Normal LV
systolic function with LVEF > 55% and moderate LVH. The left
atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic
dissection is seen. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion. Intact interatrial septum. No clot seen in
LAA. Normal coronary sinus. Significant diastolic dysfunction
with e' < 8 cm/sec.

POSTBYPASS: Normal LV systolic function Normal functioning
mechanical valve prosthesis. Otherwise no change.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2139-12-22**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an elective coronary artery
bypass grafting times one and aortic valve replacement with a
porcine tissue valve. She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred in critical but stable condition to the surgical
intensive care unit. By the following day she was extubated.
Her chest tubes were removed. She transferred to the surgical
step down floor.  Her epicardial wires were removed.  She was
seen by physical therapy. By post-operative day four she was
ready for discharge to [**Hospital 671**] Healthcare in [**Location (un) 4047**].  Her
expected length of stay at this rehab is less than thirty days.
All follow-up appointments were advised.
