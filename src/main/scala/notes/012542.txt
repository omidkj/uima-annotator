Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
High degree AV block

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
64 yo F with a-fib on coumadin, dCHF, mod-severe MR improved to
mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**12-17**], IDDM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, NASH & ESRD s/p
liver and kidney [**7-/2153**] presented to [**Hospital1 **] with high degree AV
block. The patient was last admitted [**Date range (1) 49798**] for dyspnea and
lower ext edema. She was diuresed and sent home on 100mg lasix
[**Hospital1 **] and 5mg metolazone. The patient reports lower abdominal
pain, loose stools and nausea/vomiting over the last 2 days. Pt
also reports some chills, but no frank fevers. Today, the
patient was visiting her family and felt weak. She was unable to
get out of her chair and look extremely fatigued per the family.
They called EMS and she was found to have HR 20-30's and they
were unable to palpate a pulse. There is also a report of
several seconds of VT, but no stripes available and no reported
shocks. There was no reported loss of conciousness. She was
transcutaneously paced and taken to [**Hospital 5871**] Hospital. The
tracing showed high degree AV block 2:1. The patient was also
found to be in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.3 and
hyperkalemic to 5.6. She was given calcium, insulin and D50. She
was given 3.3L of IVF. She reportly underwent non-contrast CT
abdomen that was negative, but no report or images. Her WBC
count was 12.4, lactate 3.3 and given 1 dose of Zosyn &
Imipenem. A transvenous pacer was placed, paced at 70 and
transferred here for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.6 71 148/51 21 98% 6L. The
patients labs were significant for Cr 2.8, BUN 107, WBC: 11.3,
lactate 2.2, INR: 3.9. Cardiac enzymes were trop 0.08, CK 41. UA
was negative and CXR did not show infiltrate or extensive edema.
Pt received renal U/S prior to transport to the CCU.
.
On arrive the patient states she has continued lower abdominal
pain. She states that she has had a chronic cough and some SOB.
She has nausea, but no vomiting. She states she feels cold and
reports shakes. She reports some mild chest discomfort.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of
the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, stable 2 pillow orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING:
RENAL U/S:
IMPRESSION: At least no diastolic flow with suggestion of
reversal of
diastolic flow within an arterial branch within the renal hilum.
Stable
elevated resistive indices seen in more peripheral branches
involving the
upper pole, interpolar region, and lower pole. Rejection or ATN
are of
concern. Patent renal vein.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM: Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.2 cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-12-7**],
the severity of aortic stenosis has slightly progressed. The
severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure are slightly lower.
