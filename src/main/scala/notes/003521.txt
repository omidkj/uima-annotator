Transfer from ICU, patient originally presented with acute

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11875**] is a 74 year old male with a history of HTN, DM2,
ESRD on HD with atrophic L kidney, who presented to the ED on
[**2115-6-24**] with a chief complaint of dyspnea on his way to
hemodialysis.  The patient is a poor historian, and it is
difficult to get a history from him even with an interpreter,
however the following was obtained:  He had last received his
regularly scheduled HD on [**2115-6-21**].  Patient denies any history of
chest pain, palpitations, or change in diet (no high salt
intake).  He does describe some nausea, emesis, and lack of
apetite for the last few months.  About 1 week ago he noted
increased peripheral edema, and on the night prior to admission
he began having increased SOB.  He denies any fevers.  He
describes a recent weight loss secondary to his nausea and
decreased apetite, however he is uncertain of how much.  He may
have had some mild abdominal pain, but this is only over the
last few days.

On presentation to the ED, he was afebrile, with bp 220/148, HR
103, RR 30s, saturating 94-97% on 100%NRB.  He was placed on
BIPAP and NTG drip with good response:  RR decreased to 20s, BP
decreased to 173/115, and the patient was transfered to the MICU
for further management of what was felt to be most likely a CHF
exacerbation based on physical exam findings of volume overload.
 No recent echo reports, however patient had a stress test in
[**2106**] with 9.5 minutes of [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, no ischemia or EKG
changes.

The patient was transferred to the MICU for further management
of his CHF exacerbation.  A CXR showed moderate CHF with small
bilateral pleural effusions.  EKG was without ST,T wave changes.
 He received HD with good response - normalization of BP, IV
nitro drip was weaned.  Received second HD [**6-25**] (day after
admission to ICU), and was subsequently transferred to the
floors.

Past Medical History:
HTN
DM2
Nephrolithiasis, s/p bilateral ureteral stents in [**2110**]
ESRD on HD (M,W,F)
Atrophic L kidney
Liver biopsy c/w granulomatous hepatitis
h/o infected R IJ permacath s/p removal 3/04
L forearm AVG [**1-17**]

Social History:
Patient denies ever drinking alcohol, smoking, or doing drugs.
Married, but no children.  Lives at home where he says he has
plenty of support, but won't elaborate regarding who the support
is.  Has difficulty with transportation to dialysis, and is very
interested in acquiring this transportation.

Family History:
Difficult to elicit, even with translator.

Physical Exam:
VS: 96.2, P 76, BP 126/81, R 16.

Echocardiogram [**2115-6-26**]:  Left to right shunt across the
interatrial septum consistent with a stretched patient foramen
ovale or small atrial septal defect.  Left ventircular wall
thickness was normal.  The left ventricular cavity size is
normal.  Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
distal anterior and septal apical hypokinesis, inferior
hypokinesis/akinesis and basal inferoseptal hypokinesis with
mild hypokinesis elsewhere.  Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal.  The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.  Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.  The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  Mild mitral
regurgitation.  Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred to the MICU for further management
of his CHF exacerbation.  A CXR showed moderate CHF with small
bilateral pleural effusions.  EKG was without ST,T wave changes.
 He received HD with good response - normalization of BP, IV
nitro drip was weaned.  Received second HD [**6-25**] (day after
admission to ICU), and was subsequently transferred to the
floors.

1) CHF - The patient was still mildly volume overloaded on PE
upon arrival to the floors, with mild bipedal edema and rales at
the right base, [**Last Name (un) 11876**] he received hemodialysis M,T,W with more
than 11 kg fluid removed, and is without signs of failure on
physical exam currently.  As to the cause of the CHF
exacerbation, renal feels that patient may not have been having
enough fluid removed at HD since patient has recently lost
weight, and therefore dry weight may have been overestimated,
and therefore they weren't removing as much fluid as they should
have been.  They do not feel that the patient needs to be on
Lasix, as they will remove fluid via HD, which he will continue
as an outpatient M,W,F.

Cardiac enzymes were ordered to rule out a myocardial infarction
as a cause of his CHF, with Troponin T elevated, however in this
patient with renal failure, a TnI would be more useful.  CK-MB
has been wnl.  We also ordered an echocardiogram in order to
evaluate his pump function, which showed diffuse hypokinesis of
the left ventricle, as described in the pertinent results
section.  As the patient has never had a stress test before, we
ordered a p-MIBI in order to further evaluate his cardiac risk,
which was a poor study secondary to failure of the patient to
achieve greater than 60% of his maximum heart rate, and was
stopped after 4 minutes.  In light of this, the interpretation
of perfusion defects is somewhat unreliable.  No perfusion
defects were seen on this limited study.  What was able to be
determined, however, was that his EF was only 26%, indicating a
cardiomyopathy.  Cardiology recommends a dobutamine echo as an
outpatient to further evaluate his coronary vasculature.  We
started him on Aspirin 325 mg PO qday.

2) ESRD - Patient currently receiving HD and being followed by
renal. Most likely secondary to his DM, and HTN.  We felt that
addition of an ACE-I would be beneficial in this patient with
Diabetes, CHF, and HTN, and started Lisinopril 2.5 mg qday,
discontinuing his calcium channel blocker in order to allow for
this addition.  We also started him on nephrocaps 1 tab PO qday,
Phoslo 2 tabs TID for phosphate binding, and Renagel.  We
continued his epogen, and held a couple of doses secondary to
normal hematocri
