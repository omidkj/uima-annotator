ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14194**] was in his USOH until [**2163-7-25**] when he
presented with hemoptysis and weight loss of 10 pounds over
previous 1-2 months. He had a CT scan of the chest on [**8-21**] and
it showed a 4.1 x 4.0 right hilar mass with subcarinal
lymphadenopathy, 19 mm right axillary lymph node as well as
multiple right lower lobe and left lower lobe nodules concerning
for lung cancer. On [**2163-8-28**], he was admitted to [**Hospital1 771**] with chest pain and ruled out for a
non-ST elevation MI. He was seen by the hematology-oncology
consult service while in the hospital and underwent FNA of the
right axillary lymph node, the pathology of which showed
nonsmall cell cancer, squamous cell type. He was discharged on
the third of [**Month (only) 359**] and then on [**2163-8-30**], he had a
bronchoscopy done for evaluation of his hemoptysis as well as
bronchial biopsy and the cytology confirmed metastatic nonsmall
cell lung cancer. He has subsequently completed 2 cycles of
Navelbine.

He lives in [**Location 3146**]. He is married and has a daughter and a son.
[**Name (NI) **] has two grandchildren. He is here today with his wife & son.

Imaging:
CTA [**2164-1-14**]:
1. No pulmonary embolism or secondary signs of embolism.
2. While the right hilar mass, multiple parenchymal lung masses,
and thoracic lymphadenopthy have deacreased in size,
intra-abdominal metastases, including hepatic metastases, have
increased in size. L1 lucent lesion, worrisome for metastasis,
is more conspicuous today.
3. Emphysema with upper lobe predominant ground- glass opacity
which may
represent respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung
disease.
4. Decreased right pleural effusion.
.
CXR on Admission:  No appreciable change compared to torso
[**2163-10-27**]. Known right hilar and right lower lobe masses
re-demonstrated with persistent interstitial abnormality of the
right lung concerning for possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
No evident new superimposed acute abnormality.
.
CXR [**2164-1-17**]: In comparison with the study of [**1-14**], there is
persistent
enlargement of the right hilum consistent with the mass seen on
CT.
Increasing opacification in the right upper lobe just above the
minor fissure consistent with developing pneumonia. Suggestion
of a similar area of opacification in the left upper zone. Mild
atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 y/o M w/ long smoking history, emphysema, metastatic
non-small cell lung cancer, CAD, who p/w respiratory distress
from COPD flare. Initially admitted to MICU,  improved on
steroids & azithromycin and transferred to OMED. [**Hospital 2035**] hospital
course according to active problem list.
.
#Respiratory distress: Secondary to COPD exacerbation. Initially
treated in ICU requiring 50% face mask. Transferred to OMED once
oxygen requirement stable on NC. Stable on 4 L NC (patient's
baseline is 2 L NC). Patient was discharged on prednisone taper
and inhalers. Patient was treated with Azithromycin for total of
7 days.
.
#Leukocytosis: Stable at WBC 40K. Was as high as 63K on
admission. Discussed with Heme/Onc to evaluate his leukocytosis
and eosinophilia, which was thought likely [**12-26**] underlying cancer
and unlikely related to tx with Alimta.
.
# Lung Ca: Hepatic metastases. Care per primary oncologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# Hyperkalemia: Resolved following kayexylate. Captopril was
discontinued (started during admission for elevated blood
pressure).
.
#Hypertension: Atenolol held during acute exacerbation,
re-started prior to discharge.
.
# Urinary retention: Patient demonstrated urinary retention in
ICU. Refused foley and discharge on BPH medication. Improved
prior to discharge.
.
#CAD: Not active during admission. Discharged on statin and
Atenolol. Patient did not tolerate captopril due to hyperK.
- Patient should discuss ASA use with primary care doctor
