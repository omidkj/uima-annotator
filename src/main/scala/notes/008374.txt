1. Large right anterior mediastinal crescentic structures
demonstrating
hematocrit effect is consistent with a postoperative hematoma.
Curvilinear
material in a Y-shaped conformation abutting the most cephalad
portion of the
graft material is concering for extravasation although could
represent
surgical material). A delayed scan is recommended for further
assessment if
the patient is hemodynamically stable.
2. Compression of the SVC raises the possibility of SVC
syndrome, which is
consistent with the pronounced anasarca, new right pleural
effusion (probably
serosanginous in nature) and ascites.
3. No pulmonary embolus

The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%) with abnormal septal motion (post op)..
Right ventricular chamber size is somewhat small with free wall
hypokinesis. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. There
is a normal gradient. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a large (>3cm) anterior pericardial effusion
with compression of the right atrium and right venticle and
extensive stranding. The effusion is smaller (1cm)
inferolaterally and echo filled consistent with blood,
inflammation or other cellular elements. There is sustained
right atrial collapse, consistent with tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2165-7-2**].  Workup included chest CT
and echo which revealed a large, loculated pericardial effusion
resulting in compression of the SVC and RV diastolic collapse
c/w tamponade physiology.  Anticoagulation was reversed with FFP
and Vitamin K.  The patient was brought to the operating room on
[**2165-7-3**] where he underwent evacuation of pericardial hematoma.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was
initiated.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor
for further recovery.  Chest tubes were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged to home with VNA services in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.  He will
resume hemodialysis at his regular center on Tuesday [**2165-7-9**].
The [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital 2786**] clinic will resume management of
INR/coumadin dosing.
