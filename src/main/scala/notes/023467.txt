Brief Hospital Course:
68 y/o male with ESRD on hemodialysis who underwent living
unrelated kidney transplant on [**2119-4-26**] with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**].
Per the operative note, in summary the two arteries needed to be
reconstructed. Once this was done, the kidney reperfused. It
reperfused well initially and then became dusky but as the case
went on it became more pink and began making just a little bit
of urine. The kidney was placed in the right iliac fossa.
He received routine induction immunosuppression to include
cellcept, thymoglobulin and 500 mg solumedrol. He received a
total of 3 doses of 125 mg ATG.
Please see the operative note for further sugical detail.
In the immediate post-operative period, ECG was done that showed

Sinus rhythm, with Left axis deviation and ST-T wave
abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2119-4-24**] ST-T wave
abnormalities are more marked.
CK and troponins were cycled with Troponin peak of 1.87.
Cardiology consult deemed this an STEMI. He remained intubated
and was admitted to the SICU for close monitoring.
He was extubated on POD 2.
Troponins trended down and the S-T wave abnormalities lessened
as well.
He remained in the ICU until POD 4 due to bed availability
issues, however he made good progress with advancing diet,
mobility bed to chair.
He was transferred to the regular surgical floor on POD 5, and
was evaluated by PT. He will be discharged home with a walker,
he was able to climb a flight of stairs.
From a cardiology standpoint, he was started on aspirin, and
will return to his home dose of Toprol XL. He is to follow-up
with his outpatient cardiologist.
Blood sugars initially elevated but returning to better control
by discharge. He will restart home Lantus and Humalog and is to
follow-up with [**Name8 (MD) **] NP who has been following him as an
outpatient.
Incision was oozing some serous fluid, he was sent with
instructions to change the dressing daily and PRN and leave OTA
once it dries up. He did have ecchmosis around his scrotum.
He was voiding well, with good urine volume, creatinine decresed
to 1.3 by day of discharge. Tolerating diet and ambulating with
walker.
