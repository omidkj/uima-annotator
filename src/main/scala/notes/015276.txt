Chest: [**2181-7-31**]
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
effusions,
similar compared to the prior study. Bibasilar air space
opacities likely
reflect atelectasis.
 .
8/ [**10-2**]
RENAL ULTRASOUND: The transplanted kidney measures 11.3 cm. No
evidence of
hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection. The main renal
artery and
vein are patent with normal waveforms. Resistive indices in the
upper, mid
and lower poles of the transplant kidney are 0.75, 0.74 and 0.72
respectively,
previously ranging from 0.78 to 0.81.

The bladder is collapsed about the Foley and could not be well
evaluated in
this study.

IMPRESSION:
1. No perinephric fluid or hydronephrosis.
2. Resistive indices in the upper, mid and lower poles of the
transplant
kidney range from 0.75 to 0.78.
