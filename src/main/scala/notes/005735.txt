History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28265**] is a 78 yo female with extensive clot burden (PE,
aortic throbus, splenic infarct) now on coumadin, SVT s/p
ablation, recent admission cardiac arrest (discharged [**2-20**]); now
admit for large thigh hematoma leading to Hct drop and
hypotension. Patient was recently discharged to rehab on [**2156-2-20**]
after admission for s/p cardiac arrest and AVNRT ablation.
Treated for C.diff that admission. Discharged on coumadin and
lovenox (until INR therapeutic, given through AM of admission.
.
On AM of [**2-27**] awoke with L thigh pain and swelling. Had been fine
on prior day, went for a walk at rehab. Had CT at rehab and
found to have thigh hematoma there. Reportedly did have
instrumentation on L femoral region (? only venous or arterial)
during last hospital course.
.
In the ED, T 99, BP 94/65, HR 120, R18, 100% RA. Pressure
dropped to 86/43. Hct 22, INR 1.9. Got 1 unit PRBCs, awaiting
second. Given 1 L NS. Not reversed given extensive clot burdern
and overall stability. On CXR can't rule out pneumonia, written
for ceftriaxone and levoflox but has not yet received.

[**2156-2-28**]
CT torso and left LE: IMPRESSION:
1. No aortic thrombus. Thrombosis of the celiac axis, as before.

2. Large hypodense area within the spleen, likely sequelae from
infarction.
3. Very large left groin/medial thigh hematoma with
high-attenuation focus
located superiorly and centrally suspicious for arterial
extravasation.

[**2156-3-6**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of renal stones.
2. Colonic wall thickening and pericolonic stranding is seen
along the
ascending colon and splenic flexure with mild sigmoid thickening
in some
areas, concerning for colitis.
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
4. Mild improvement of the left pleural effusion and left lower
lobe
atelectasis since the prior study. Persistent mild right
atelectasis is seen.


[**2156-3-8**] CT head without contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Equivocal left frontovertex focal subarachnoid hemorrhage is
no longer
seen.
3. Generalized atrophy, likely accounting for the symmetric
prominence of the bifrontal extra-axial CSF spaces.

[**2156-3-9**] ECHO:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild mitral valve prolapse. A late systolic jet of Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-2-14**],
left and right ventricular systolic function has normalized. The
severity of mitral regurgitation has decreased.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo F with HTN, recent cardiac arrest and large clot burden
with PE, aortic thrombus, SVT s/p recent ablation who presented
with acute blood loss anemia and hypotension and found to be
bleeding into her left thigh.  Given her clot burden she has
been discharged on her prior admission on coumadin and lovenox.
She presented with a large left thigh/groin hematoma and
hypotension from acute blood loss anemia. She initially required
a stay in the MICU and required blood pressor agents and a total
of 5 units of PRBCs. Vascular surgery and interventional
radiology were consulted initially, but her bleeding quickly
slowed down and she responded to blood products, so no
procedural intervention was needed. Once she was stabilized she
was transferred to the medical floor. Her hematocrit remained
stable throughout the rest of the admission.
.
# acute blood loss anemia: She was subtherapeutic on admission
with INR of 1.9 but also on lovenox at the time of the bleed.
She had had prior instrumentation through her left groin for SVT
ablation procedure and a femoral venous line. This was believed
to contribute to the fagility of her vessels. Hematology consult
was obtained regarding risks and benefits to restarting
anticoagulation (recent bleed and huge fall risk, but large clot
burden). Her husband thought she had some bright red blood per
rectum at rehab prior to admission, and she had a history of
some gross hematuria. To further evaulate this she underwent
upper and lower endoscopy which were clean without source of
bleeding or polyps and she underwent cystoscopy which was also
clean. Urology consult believed that a prior kidney stone had
contributed to her prior hematuria. Two urinalyses were negative
for blood. She does have a urine cytology pending at discharge.
While off of anticoagulation, she also had a work up for
coagulopathy which was largely negative. Some tests were still
pending at discharge. She should follow up with her outpatient
Hematologist. Given this work up, it was decided that she should
be restarted on anticoagulation in consultation with the
Hematologist. She was discharged on lovenox and coumadin. VNA
services will check her INR and HCT and fax them to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
