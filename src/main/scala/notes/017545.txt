Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service for
scheudled endovascular surgical treatment of and abdominal
aortic aneurysm.  On [**2154-6-17**] the patient underwent endovascular
aortic aneurysm repair with fenestrated graft, which went well
without complications (see operative note for further details).
Of note, pt's   After a breif uneventful stay in the PACU, the
patient arrived to the floor NPO on IV fluids and on
antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and with minimal pain.  The
patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient received minimal doses of Dilaudid IV for
pain.  Dilaudid was eventually D/C'ed because the patient was
not complaining of pain.

CV: The patient has a pacemaker; had one episode of SVT with HR
~150's for approx 40sec during which he was completly
asymptomatic.  Cardiology saw the patient, adjusted the
pacemaker to include a monitoring range from 140-160, and made
no further changes or recs.  No additional medications were
given during the episode and the episode did not recur.  Pt had
a central venous line installed for access but that was removed
prior to discharge.  Pt remained stable after that episode and
was stable on discharge.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Early
ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout
hospitalization.  No acute issues.

GU:  Pt with poor urine output after surgery secondary to L
renal artery embolization related to graft placement.  Cr was
elevated as well as high as 2.9.  Foley catheter was placed and
daily weights were recorded to evaluate fluid status.  Renal
ultrasound performed indicated that the remaining R-kidney had
adequate blood flow.  Per Renal Service recommendation, we DC'ed
the pt's home dose of Ramipril for concern of glomerular
hypoperfusion.    Urine output was routinly monitored and
adequate on discharge and Cr declined to 2.6.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored,
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.  Now on a
regular Diabetic Diet.

ID: Pt found to have UTI on UA and treated with 3 days of
Ciprofloxacin in house.  Otherwise, the patient's white blood
count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of
infection.

Wound care: bilateral EVAR incision sites were monitored and
well maintained.  No signs of infection.

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay and found to be somewhat elevated ranging from
110's-230's so placed on a sliding scale of insulin. However pt
never diagnosed with diabetes, so consider discontinuing the
regimen on discharge from the Rehab.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay; would continue HSQ until patient is theraputic on his
Coumadin then DC at that time.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding through a condom catheter (for urine
output monitoring), and complaining of no pain.  The patient
received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with
understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.
