MICRO:
Urine Cx ([**12-7**]): no growth
Urine Cx ([**12-15**]): no growth
.
IMAGING:
.
Renal U/S ([**12-7**]): RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures
8.4 cm. The left kidney measures 9.8 cm. The corticomedullary
differentiation is preserved. There are no stones or
hydronephrosis. A Foley catheter is seen within a collapsed
bladder.
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable renal ultrasound.
.
CXR ([**12-7**]): FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low limiting
detailed evaluation. There are bilateral moderate pleural
effusions. There is prominent cephalization of the pulmonary
veins. The patient is status post median sternotomy and multiple
surgical clips project over the silhouette of the aorta. The
upper lungs are clear. The visualized soft tissues and osseous
structures are grossly unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions most consistent
with congestive heart failure. Repeat radiography following
appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for underlying
infection.
.
ECG ([**12-7**]): Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats.
Since the previous tracing of [**2168-1-1**] the rate is faster and
the ventricular premature beats are new. QRS voltage has
decreased. The Q-T interval is shorter and lateral T wave
inversions are no longer present.
.
TTE ([**12-8**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild to moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The
remaining segments contract well (LVEF = 35%). [Intrinsic
function may be more depressed given the severity of mitral
regurgitation.] No intraventricular thrombus is seen. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
