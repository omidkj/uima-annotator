History of Present Illness:
74 year old man with history of CAD status post CABG in [**2111**]
(LIMA to Diagonal, SVG to OM2, SVG to RCA), with a cardiac
catheterization in [**2115**] that revealed three vessel disease, but

(mean gradient 32 mmHg and valve area 1.1 cm2). Drug eluting
stents were placed into the lower pole of OM2 and the proximal
LAD. In addition, patient has a history of atrial fibrillation
and COPD. On [**2118-1-14**], he presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with
chest tightness and shortness of breath, with rapid ventricular
rate of 126, following several day course of antibiotics
prescribed by his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was converted to normal sinus rate
with IV diltiazem and he received IV lasix for diuresis. A TEE
was performed on [**2118-1-18**] that revealed an EF of 65%,
worsened AS (0.7cm2), 1+AR, 1-2MR.
Patient was transferred for cardiac catheterization on [**1-19**]. Results demonstrated severe 3 vessel disease, with patent
stents to proximal LAD and OM2 and patent graft of SVG to RCA
and OM2, and the LIMA to D1 was patent. Severe AS was noted.
Patient awaiting AVR.

[**2118-1-19**] Cardiac Cath: Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant
system revealed mult-vessel native disease. The LMCA had no flow

limiting lesions. The LAD had a patent stent with competitive
flow from
the D1.  The LCX had a patent stent in the lower pole of OM2.
The RCA
was distally occluded. Graft angiography revealed patent SVG-OM,
SVG-PDA, and SVG-LIMA. The aortic valve had a mean gradient of
55mmHg and a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.64 cm2. Mean PCPW was elevated
at 20mmHg and cardiac index was low normal at 2.4 l/min/m2.


Brief Hospital Course:
Preoperatively Mr. [**Known lastname **] was seen by pulmonary medicine for
his COPD, with recommendations to start standing Atrovent, and
continue Prednisone therapy. Preoperative chest CT scan showed
severe cystic bronchiectasis involving all lobes of both lungs,
with associated air-fluid levels, scattered areas of bronchial
mucoid impaction, and minimal peribronchiolar inflammation.
There were however no contraindications to surgery. He was taken
to the operating room on [**2118-1-21**] where Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed a
redo sternotomy, and a mechanical aortic valve replacement. For
surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative note.
He was transferred to the CSRU in critical but stable condition.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologiclly intact and was extubated
on POD #1 without incident. He was seen by nephrology for
oliguria and acute renal insufficiency with likely diagnosis
ATN(acute tubular necrosis)secondary to hypotension and bypass,
with recomendations for volume and avoiding diuresis. A decrease
in platelet count prompted a HIT screen which was positive. He
was subsequently started on Argatroban, and eventually Warfarin
once his platelet count was > 100. While in the CSRU, he also
experienced episodes of paroxsymal atrial fibrillation which was
initially treated with Amiodarone and beta blockade. Given his
severe COPD, Amiodarone was discontinued while beta blockade was
continued for rate control. Despite advancement in beta
blockade, he continued to experience PAF. He otherwise remained
stable from a cardiac and pulmonary standpoint and transferred
to the SDU for further care and recovery. He gradually became
therapeutic on Warfarin and Argatroban was eventually
discontinued. His renal function continued to improve and
returned to baseline prior to discharge. He worked daily with
physical therapy and continued to make clinical improvements
with gentle diuresis. He was eventually cleared for discharge on
POD 8. Prior to discharge, arrangements were made to follow up
with primary care physician/cardiologist regarding outpatient
Warfarin monitoring. Given his PAF and mechanical AVR, his goal
INR should be between 2.5 - 3.0.
