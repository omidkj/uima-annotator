Chief Complaint: SOB
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 89F with history of COPD on home O2 2LNC,
pulmonary hypertension, renal insufficiency and carotid
insufficiency who presented with acute onset SOB and was
admitted to the MICU with hypercarbic respiratory distress.
Patient recently admitted for similar symptoms earlier this
month, was discharged from rehab 1 week ago. The patient reports
she was doing well until the day of admission, when she noticed
acute onset SOB at 10:30 pm. Prior to that, she was using her
oxygen continuously, taking her inhalers as scheduled, and
walking around her house/doing daily tasks without any
difficulty breathing. ROS pertinent for a chronic cough without
sputum production. Ne fevers or chills. In the ED, patient's
vital signs were stable, but was noted to be lethargic with poor
air movment on pulmonary exam, both of which improved with
nebulizers, solumedrol, and azithromycin/CFTX. ABG with evidence
of CO2 retention. EKG with LBBB, LVH similar to prior (STE noted
on EKG in ambulance, but not present on arrival to the ED). CXR
with possible RLL infiltrate.

During the patient's ICU course, she was noted to be SOB with
limited air movement. She was started on continuous albuterol
inhalers and intermittent BiPAP. She was started on Levo/Flagyl
for presumed aspiration PNA vs CAP and had a PICC line placed.
She was also started on steroids (prednisone 60 mg PO daily) for
presumed COPD exacerbation. This morning she had an episode of L
sided SSC 'pain' that radiated to her right arm associated with
some diaphoresis but no LOC, nausea, or vomiting. Has not
experienced this pain before. EKG with reportedly no changes.
Her CP resolved completely with 0.3 mg SL nitroglycerin and did
not return during the remainder of the admission. Noted to be
having improved air movement during ICU stay, and was weaned
from continuous to q3H ipratroprium and q6H albuterol nebs, and
transitioned to oral prednisone prior to being called out to the
floor.

On the floor, patient states that her SOB is greatly improved
and denies any further episodes of chest pain.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denied palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. No dysuria. Pt admits to some difficulty
swallowing and sometimes is concerned that food goes down her
windpipe, and states she needs new dentures b/c her current ones
are ill-fitting.

Pulm: no rales, no wheezes, no rhonchi (resolved during the

Pertinent Results:
Significant for WBC of 17.3, Hct of 32.0, Cre of 1.3, CK Trop-T
of 0.01, 0.02 ABG 7.4/40/76*/26 Lactate 4.0->3.3

Microbiology:
Urine Legionella Antigen - negative.
MRSA Screen - negative.

Imaging:
EKG - [**7-11**] - sinus tachycardia, + LVH, +LBBB, no new ischemic
changes compared to previous.

CXR - [**7-11**] -
Cardiac silhouette is normal in size. Mediastinal contours are
notable for a tortuous aorta as well as aortic calcification.
There is no pneumothorax. Left pleural effusion and atelectasis
are resolved. There is a new small right pleural effusion with
overlying atelectasis.

CXR - [**7-12**] - Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged from [**7-11**], [**2160**]. Cardiac size is normal. The aorta is tortuous. Right
PICC tip remains in the right subclavian vein. Bibasilar
opacities, left greater than right, are stable due to a
combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. There are no
new lung abnormalities.

TTE: [**2161-6-17**] -
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no valvular
aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely
related to high cardiac output. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-3-8**], no
major change. Pulmonary hypertension without clear cor pulmonale
or intracardiac shunt.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 89 yo F with COPD on 2 L home O2, pulmonary hypertension,
CKD who presents with acute onset dyspnea likely c/w HCAP
requiring ICU admission with continuous nebs and NIPPV,
subsequently transferred to the medicine flow.

#. Shortness of Breath: Patient initially admitted to the MICU
with hypercarbic respiratory distress requiring continuous
inhalers, NIPPV (BiPAP) and IV steroids. Likely had a COPD
exacerbation, triggered by a PNA (initially ?aspiration vs HCAP,
but ultimately most likely HCAP given recent hospitalization and
rehab stay). Initially treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for
HCAP, briefly switched to Levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration
PNA in the MICU, subsequently switched to Vanc/Cipro for HCAP
once on the general floor. She completed a 7D course of vanc and
had 1 add'l day of cipro on discharge. Urine legionella antigen
negative. Patient low probability for PE per Well's criteria. Pt
without evidence of ACS on EKG and with several sets of negative
cardiac enzymes. Nebs were weaned on the floor to albuterol q4H
prn and ipratroprium q3H standing, which she tolerated well. By
[**7-14**], she was back to her baseline oxygen requirement of 2L NC
with minimal shortness of breath. Her home inhalers, spiriva and
advair, were held during this admission. We began a long
prednisone taper starting on [**7-15**] (40mg x 3 days) and will
continue with 20 mg qd x 3 days starting [**7-18**], then 10mg x 3 days
starting [**7-21**]. We asked for palliative care's recommendations
regarding symptom management and assistance with preventing
re-hospitalization. They recommended trying a small dose of
liquid morphine 30 mins before activity to see if this might
decrease shortness of breath (as trial for home). We encourage
