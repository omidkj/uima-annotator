Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
dizziness, cardioversion X2


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 81 yom with h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 15% s/p
BiV pacer in [**2185**] and h/o NSVT who presents with 4 days of
progressive lightheadedness and 2 episodes of ICD cardioversion.
 He says dizziness begain 4 days PTA lasting 5-10 seconds, [**1-4**]
hrs apart.  He thought it was due to coumadin and went to the
hospital Monday to have coumadin level checked.  Sx continued
and on day of admission they were every few minutes happening
hundreds of times throughout the course of the day.  He went to
[**Hospital6 **] where he underwent CT head and
carotid u/s which were unremarkable.  He was monitored on
telemetry where he had no abnormal events, despite "hundreds" of
episodes of light headedness.  He was discharged at 4pm.  At
4:15, he was in the car with his wife where he again felt light
headed and felt an "explosion in his chest", continued to feel
dizzy and felt a second "explosion".  He had no syncopal events.


He returned to the ED vs were 180/89   156   18   97RA and was
noted to be in NSVT.  ECG showed demand pacing with multiple
PVCS.  Rightward Axis.  LBBB qith QRS of 190.  Another ECG
showed 6 beat NSVT.  Per preliminary interrogation reqport:142
FVT/ VTs since 2 pm today. Had some failed ATP- most successful,
atleast 2 shocks on rhythms > 185. He was started on amio bolus
of 150mg and started on 1mg/kg at 5:30pm.  He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] shortly afterwards.

On arrival, pt was hemodynamically stable.  He was alert,
oriented,  and responding to questions.  Vital signs were  97.8
 120/50  82 18 95%RA.  ECG again showed significant ectopy.  No
ischemic changes.

Of note, pt is generally quite active with daily exercise
routine and many hobbies.  ICD was last interrogated [**2191-5-2**]
which showed multiple episodes of NSVT.   Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 1565**]
note, he was on amiodarone at that time.  Unclear for what
duration he was continued on amio.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope.

STUDIES:
[**2191-11-17**] CXR:
There is no pulmonary edema. Heart is top normal size, no
pleural effusion is present. The transvenous right atrial pacer
and right ventricular pacer
defibrillator lead are in standard placements. A percutaneous
pair of
epicardial leads is present, but there connections are unclear

[**2191-11-18**] ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20
%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

There is marked postextrasystolic augmentation of left
ventricular ejection fraction andf stroke volume, indicating the
presence of significant myocardial contractile reserve.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old man with h/o of ischemic heart
disease, and CMY EF 15% with BiV pacer and ICD, p/w VT storm.

# CORONARIES: H/o ischemic disease with multiple stents.  No
revascularabile disease as of [**2190-12-2**]. Pt not having ischemic
sx currently or recently. Pt was kept on ASA, BB, Lipitor. ACEi
was held [**1-3**] to renal failure - can be restarted as an
outpatient.

# PUMP:  Pt has h/o generally well controlled cardiomyopathy.
He appeared to be mildly volume overloaded based on pulmonary
edema, but not requiring oxygen. He was diuresed gently with IV
Lasix and will be discharged on home dose of Lasix 20mg PO
daily.

# RHYTHM: The patient was admitted with VT storm, s/p
defibrillation by his ICD x2. He had ectopy on arrival, which
decreased with Amiodarone. He was bolused with Amio 150mg and
started on a drip, then transitioned to PO for Amio loading. He
will be discharged on Amio taper: 400mg PO TID x 4 days, 400mg
PO BID x 7 days, 400mg PO daily x 7 days, 200mg PO daily
ongoing. He should also continue his beta blocker and warfarin
for underlying atrial fibrillation. Warfarin was d
