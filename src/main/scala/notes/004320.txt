Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**7-21**] for heparin coverage while off coumadin and cardiac
catherization.  The catherization revealed RCA 100%, 40% LAD,
40% pCX,and occluded distal CX. Carotid US did not show any
significant stenosis. He went to the operating [****] for
coronary artery bypass graft, aortic valve replacement, mitral
valve repair, and ascending aorta replacement.  Please see
operative for further details.  He was transferred to the CSRU
in stable condition on phenylephrine and propofol drips. In the
first twenty four hours he awoke neurologically intact, weaned
from sedation and was extubated without complications.  He
received a five day course of azithromycin given by history for
chronic sinusitis each time the he has been intubated in the
past. Cardiology was consulted due to ST elevations in V2-V6
with pericardial rub, Echo and EKG obtained.  Started on NSAID
for pericarditis and plavix for poor targets.  Transferred to
the floor on POD #2 to begin increasing his activity level. He
was gently diuresed toward his preoperative weight and beta
blockade titrated. Pacing wires removed without incident on POD
#3. He went into Atrial fibrillation  [**7-29**], but converted back
to sinus rhythm.  He again went into rapid atrial fibrillation
and was treated with amiodarone and lopressor with no response.
He was then bolused and started on cardiazem drip that he
converted to sinus rhythm for a few hours and then went into
atrial flutter.  Electrophysiology was consulted and plan for
cardioversion.  He developed a sternal click and chest xray
revealed sternal dehiscence on POD 6.  He returned to the OR POD
7 for sternal debridement and cardioversion. He then went to the
OR on POD 8 with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (plastics) for debridement and
omental flap closure. Transferred to the CSRU and then extubated
again on [**8-3**]. EP re-consulted for continuing A fib management.
Diagnosed with a probable TIA on [**8-5**]. Started on coumadin on
[**8-6**]. Transferred back to the floor on [**8-9**]. Continued to make
good progress and was cleared for discharge to rehab on [**8-15**].
Pt. is to make all follow-up appts. as per discharge
instructions.
