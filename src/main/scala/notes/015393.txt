ADDENDUM:

After discussion with both the renal and infectious disease
services and the urinalysis showing only trace protein and
trace blood, no eosinophils in urine sediment or peripheral
eosinophilia, likely thought that etiology of renal sediment
and creatinine rise due to likely postinfectious resolving
glomerulonephritis and unlikely to be acute interstitial
nephritis.  Therefore, it was felt that Oxacillin should be
restarted and this was done.  The patient did have one more
episode of hematuria and urology performed successful
cystoscopy which showed urethral trauma at five o'clock in
urethrobulbar area.  No other bladder or prostate lesions.

On [**2125-1-12**], creatinine bumped from 0.7 to 0.9, and given
baseline, the patient was kept one more day to follow this
with the plan that if it continued to rise, there would be a
consideration of a renal biopsy.  However, on the day of
discharge, creatinine was 0.8.  Hepatitis B surface antigen,
hepatitis surface antibody, hepatitis core antibody, ANCA,
[**Doctor First Name **], hepatitis C antibody were all negative.

Norvasc was added and Hydralazine was stopped for blood
pressure control.  On [**2125-1-12**], blood pressure was much
better controlled, however, it was felt that a slightly
higher blood pressure would be good for renal perfusion.
Therefore, Norvasc was changed from 10 mg to 5 mg q.d.

Renal ultrasound showed stone within the gallbladder, simple
cyst of upper pole of left kidney, no renal stones.  Repeat
magnetic resonance scan showed findings consistent with
evolving epidural and perhaps intrathecal infection of
lumbosacral spine, laminectomies noted at L4-L5, cell cavity
posterior soft tissues measured 3.0 centimeters transversely,
enhancement along margins of surgical cavity, and adjacent
posterior spinal muscles, there is enhancement extending into
the spinal canal within epidural space.  Abnormal ventral
epidural enhancement visible at level of L3-L4 and extending
inferior into sacral canal.  Also thick enhancement of the
distal thecal fat with some areas of enhancing septation in
the sac at L5-S1 level, roots of cauda equina also enhanced
and somewhat clumped appearance at the nerve roots and thecal
sac is similar to that of [**2124-12-26**].  Posterior soft tissue
enhancement increased in area of abnormal ventral epidural
enhancement, more conspicuous on the current study.

On the day of discharge, the patient is stable.  No new
complaints, no back pain, chest pain, no episodes of
hematuria, no numbness, tingling, weakness or shooting pains
in legs.  Back incision was clean, dry and intact, healing
well and nontender.

After discussion with renal and infectious disease services,
the patient discharged to [**Hospital3 **].

The patient is to follow-up with primary care physician in
one to two weeks, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**] in one to two weeks
neurosurgery.  The patient is to call for these appointments.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36997**], infectious disease, on [**2124-2-1**], at 1:00 p.m.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of renal in one to two weeks.

The patient is to have Chem7 drawn three times a week, and
potassium replaced as needed, as elevated renal function
results to renal clinic.  Liver function tests drawn twice a
week.  Blood pressure taken q.d.  Fingerstick done b.i.d.

1.  Oxacillin two grams q4hours until [**2125-2-8**].
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d.

4.  Zestril 40 mg q.d.
5   Spironolactone 25 mg q.d.
6.  Labetalol 1000 mg b.i.d.

11. Protonix 40 mg q.d.
12. Lipitor 20 mg q.d.

The patient with positive troponin on admission, ruled in for
myocardial infarction by troponin.
