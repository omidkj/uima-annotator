Attending:[**Last Name (un) 20147**]
Chief Complaint:
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy with biopsies


History of Present Illness:
83yoF with history of melanoma s/p resection [**2122**], chronic afib
s/p cardioversion, who presented for bronchoscopy and
transbronchial node aspiration of left upper lobe nodule who was
transferred to the MICU for rapid afib and flash pulmonary
edema.

Briefly, the patient had melanoma of her left upper back in the
past, and as a part of the staging workup, underwent a PET-CT
[**7-/2122**] which showed a 1.8 x 1.6cm nodule in the left upper lobe
of the lung.  FNA of the LUL mass at [**Hospital1 2025**] was (+) for
adenocarcinoma, but she was not a surgical candidate for a
lobectomy so udnerwent radiofrequency ablation [**2122-11-18**].
Repeat PET-CT [**12/2123**], which showed 1.8 x 3.5 cm left upper lobe
lung lesion without positive lymph nodes, as well as a 0.5-cm
non-avid RUL pulmonary nodule and no other mets.  She declined
further treatment at that time.  In [**2124-3-7**] she developed
hemoptysis and was CXR showed an increasing mass vs PNA.  Repeat
CT/PET demonstrated increased size FDG avid LUL consolidation
with
bronchiectasis - atelectasis and post-treatment change vs
malignancy.
She also had a new FDG avid T2 vertebral body adjacent to the
lesion, most likely radiation changes but possibility of
malignancy was unable to be excluded.  She presented today, [**7-13**],
for an EBUS with biopsy of the lesion and BAL washings.  She
reports she did not take any of her home medications today
despite being advised to take some of her medications, as she
was nervous it would interfere with the procedure.

The patient became hypoxic following her EBUS and was found to
be in rapid afib and acute pulmonary edema in the PACU.  She
became hypoxic to 97% on 6L FM, and was found to be in afib in
the 120's-140's with stable BP's.  She was given Metoprolol
112.5mg po, then later received Metoprolol 5mg IV x3 without
effect.  She was 86% on RA.  She was then given Diltiazem 10mg
IV with improvement of HR to the 90's.  She received Lasix 20mg
IV x2 in the PACU.  She was also given Morphine 2mg IV,
albuterol, atrovent, and lidocaine nebs.  During thse course of
these interventions, she was 92% on 2L NC, then reported
increased dyspnea and was 95% on 3L NC, 98% on NRB, and
experienced persistent dyspnea and was then placed on Bipap with
PO2 99%, and was transferred to the MICU.

Regarding the patient's cardiac history, the patient was
cardioverted in [**12/2122**] and was on Dronedarone, but reverted
back to AF and was started on Amiodarone and underwent DCCV
12/[**2122**].  She reverted back to afib 2 weeks later, and was
continued on Amiodarone with Metoprolol for rate control.  Her
cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 21976**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11679**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2394**]), manages her
cardiac care.  Per patient's daughter, the patient had
experienced a gout flare in late [**Month (only) 116**], and her Bumex dose was
decreased on [**6-28**] from 2mg po Mon-Fri to 2mg po Mon, Wed, Fri.
Per the patient, she has been experiencing increasing dyspnea on
exertion for the past 5 days as well as increased lower
extremity edema.  She denies changes to her chronic hemoptysis,
denies fevers/chills, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, rash.
She denies chest pain, lightheadedness, nausea/vomiting.  She
denies h/o PE's, DVTs, or stroke.  Of note, she and her daughter
note that her baseline blood pressures are low, and the
daughter's most recent blood pressure during an outpatient f/u
appointment is 116/79.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient denied dyspnea, chest pain,
light headedness, palpitations, or other symptoms but was very
anxious that her face mask was leaking out oxygen and repeated
stated that she felt more comfortable on bipap.  She was briefly
re-started on bipap then switched back to NRB in less than 1
hour and denied further dyspnea or other symptoms.  She reports
feeling much improved from previously and states only that she
continues to have her cough productive of blood tinged sputum.

Imaging:
CXR: [**2124-7-13**]
AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next
preceding PA and lateral chest examination of [**2124-3-10**].
There is now marked
cardiac enlargement on this portable chest examination. The
cardiac
configuration is rather typical for left ventricular as well as
left atrial enlargement with very prominent extensive mitral
ring calcifications within the heart shadow. Thoracic
