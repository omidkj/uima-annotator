Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year-old
woman with a complicated medical history who presented to an
outside hospital on [**2152-8-2**] with complaints of
lightheadedness and intermittent chest pain.  She was
admitted to the hospital and found to be in atrial
fibrillation with periods of one to two seconds with no
conduction.  She was given beta blocker and Digoxin, which
were held and she had an episode of wide complex tachycardia.
 She was treated with two shocks and then with Adenosine and
then a calcium channel blocker.  She had increased CKs
following the defibrillation attempts.  The decision was made
at that outside hospital to place a VVI pacemaker.  She was
intubated and sent to the Intensive Care Unit.  This patient
failed to wean off the vent three times for likely presumed
congestive heart failure.  Diuretics and Natrecor were used.
On the morning of admission to [**Hospital1 188**] the patient was reintubated with a heart rate in the
150s to 160s.  She was started on Esmolol drip with a heart
rate dropping to the 120s, but the patient dropped to a
systolic of the 50s.  The patient was started on a dopamine
drip with a systolic blood pressure increasing to the 90s and
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**]
for further management of this presumed heart failure.  At
the time of admission the patient's white blood cell count
was noted to be 28.1 with a bandemia.  Cultures from the
outside hospital were negative, but the patient had been on
multiple antibiotics broad spectrum there.  Given that the
patient was hypotensive and had an increased white blood cell
count and a bandemia it was assumed that the hypotension was
due to sepsis, presumed pneumonia possibly due to aspiration
or secondary to mechanical ventilation.  The patient arrived
to the [**Hospital1 69**] Coronary Care
Unit on a ventilator.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination at that time
revealed a patient who was generally obese, sedated elderly
female.  HEENT anicteric sclera.  Mucous membranes are moist.
No JVD or increased JVP.  Cardiovascular irregular heart
rate.  A normal S2, S1 occluded by 3 out of 6 systolic murmur
heard best in the axilla.  Pulmonary the patient was
ventilated and had course breath sounds throughout.  Abdomen
obese with normoactive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended.
No appreciable hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities were without
edema, cyanosis or clubbing.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 34.9, hematocrit 38.8.
The differential on the white blood cell count was 83%
neutrophils, 7% bands, 4% lymphocytes.  Electrocardiogram on
admission revealed atrial fibrillation, left axis deviation,
left bundle branch block with occasional paced beats.
Echocardiogram at that time revealed an EF of 25 to 30% with
3+ mitral regurgitation and symmetrical left ventricular
hypertrophy.  Chest x-ray on admission revealed that the tip
of the endotracheal tube was 3 cm into the right main stem
bronchus.  There was complete opacification of the left lung
with shift of the midline structures to the left signifying
collapse.  There was also diffuse pulmonary edema.  Other
pertinent laboratories include a CK of 238, CKMB 27, cardiac
troponin of 1.03.  The cardiac enzymes later increased with a
CK of 514, MB of 72 and a troponin of 3.07.  It was assumed
at that time given that the patient was clinically in septic
shock that the troponin increase was due to strain of the
heart.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was treated for septic shock
with 15 plus liters of fluid and broad spectrum antibiotics.
All external lines and hardware with the exception of the VVI
pacer were removed from the patient and the patient was
started empirically on Vancomycin, Flagyl, Imipenem and
Miconazole powder.  She was kept well hydrated with fluids
and pressor support as needed. Regarding her cardiac function
the CK elevation was in the sating of a high cardiac output
due to likely sepsis.  Aspirin was continued and the patient
was started on a heparin drip and enzymes were cycled.  The
electrocardiogram with the baseline left bundle branch block
and now pacer placement made it difficult to say whether or
not the patient was in acute coronary syndrome.  The patient
was not a good candidate for a cardiac catheterization in the
context of sepsis.  Echocardiogram revealed that the
ejection fraction was 20% with a hypokinetic septum and
moderate symmetrical hypertrophy and 3+ mitral regurgitation.
The patient had a rhythm of chronic atrial fibrillation with
a rate that varied between 60 and 100 beats per minute.
Heparin drip was continued for anticoagulation and rate
controlling medications were added onto the treatment
regimen.

Renal, the patient had acute renal failure on admission
likely secondary to hypotension and decreased perfusion.  The
creatinine normalized down to a level of 0.6 on the day of
discharge after aggressive hydration and treatment of the
underlying causes of heart failure and sepsis.  On the first
day of admission the pressors that the patient was admitted
to [**Hospital1 69**] on were weaned off,
but Dopamine was restarted at a renal dose to improve renal
perfusion.  The patient became tachycardic to the 130s and
therefore the treatment regimen was switched to Levophed.
The patient received intravenous fluid boluses for low urine
output.  Sputum cultures grew 1+ gram negative rods.  The
patient's ventilator was weaned down to 50% with a PEEP of 8.
Tube feeds were started for nutrition and the patient's
hematocrit dropped from 31 to 26.  A TTE at this time
revealed an EF of 20 to 30% with 3+ mitral regurgitation and
apical akinesis.  The following day diuresis with Lasix and
Natrecor were pursued with a goal of removing 2 liters of
fluid.  Beta blocker was added on and increased with ace
inhibitors to reduce SVR.  Once the patient was extubated
heart rate was aggressively controlled with beta blockers and
Digoxin was added.  This achieved rate control in the 60s to
80s, but atrial fibrillation persisted.  After extubation the
patient was cleared for eating by speech and swallow video
evaluations and a diet was advanced to thick pureed foods.
The patient was weaned off of diuretics as the congestive
heart failure and cardiogenic shock resolved and all of her
intravenous medications were changed to po.  Zoloft was added
back to her regimen of medications at this time to treat the
depression that she had been managing chronically.  Heparin
was weaned off as Coumadin was started and the therapeutic
INR of greater then 2 was achieved.

On the day of discharge the patient's central line was
discontinued.  The patient was receiving nutrition through
thick feedings and her atrial fibrillation, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia were controlled on po medications.  The
patient was evaluated by physical therapy and it was
recommended that the patient continue physical therapy,
speech therapy and occupational therapy in a skilled nursing
facility.  The patient's care and needs in a skilled nursing
facility were discussed with the family at length and
Hungarian interpreters were obtained to clarify all the
patient's outpatient needs.  At the time of discharge the
patient was discharged to an extended care facility.  She was
instructed to take all of her medications as described most
importantly her Met
