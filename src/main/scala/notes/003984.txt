infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm initially found on CT chest
for routine follow-up of a lung mass.

COPD, arthritis, hammertoe deformities, major depression, a
pulmonary nodule in RUL, cataracts, footdrop of the right foot,
diastolic dysfunction by echo from [**2117**], chronic kidney disease
stage III, mitral valve prolapse, degenerative disc disease,
hearing loss, hyperlipidemia, urge incontinence, osteopenia.

predicted. colonoscopy: consistent with colitis/IBD; scoliosis;
varicose veins.

Awake, alert, NAD, anxious
Heart RRR
Lungs no respiratory distress, normal excursion/effort
Abdomen soft, NT, ND
Extremities WWP, bilateral hammertoe deformities

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2135-1-6**], the patient was admitted post-operatively after
open AAA repair.  She produced 2 guaiac positive stools, raising
concern for mesenteric ischemia.  In addition, dopplerable
signals were lost in bilateral lower extremities, raising
concern for showered emboli from the aneurysmal thrombus.  The
patient was taken back to the OR on [**2135-1-7**] for bilateral
popliteal artery exploration with embolectomy of the tibial
vessels bilaterally, exploratory laparotomy with cholecystectomy
and evacuation of hematoma.  The right DP became dopplerable,
but signals remained absent on the left DP/PT.  Pt was
transfused with blood to maintain hematocrit above 30.  On
[**2135-1-8**] the patient underwent re-exploration at left
popliteal fossa with left anterior tibial artery thrombectomy.
The patient was started on an argatroban drip out of concern for
HIT.  She went into rapid afib and was cardioverted x2.  The
patient returned to the OR [**2135-1-9**] for exploratory laparotomy
which was unremarkable, and she was left with an open abdomen.

She remained intubated and sedated since the initial surgery.
She became hypotensive requiring vasopressor drips.  She
developed anuric renal failure, requiring CVVHD.  She developed
progressive acidosis and hemodynamic instability requiring
pressors.  She returned to the OR for exploration on [**2135-1-11**] at
which time diffuse ischemia of all abdominal contents was noted
and it was deemed inappropriate to procede with bowel resection
based on the patient's previously stated wishes and a discussion
with the son.

After many family discussions, final decision was to render the
patient CMO on [**2135-1-11**].  Medications were stopped.  The patient
expired on [**2135-1-12**] at 0250.
