Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p Cardiac Arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
ICD placement


History of Present Illness:
50F with hx of coronary vasospasm, HTN that presents from an OSH
after having suffered a cardiac arrest in the field, s/p CPR
with shock x1.

Of note the pt was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service at [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (3) 1517**] after a month of increasing chest discomfort
concerning for coronary ischemia. While hospitalized, she had
dynamic ST depressions in V3-V6 during anginal episodes and
elevated trop to 0.16. At that time workup included both cardiac
cath (X2) and CT of the coronary arteries. Cath suggested
isolated bilateral coronary ostial stenosis. CTA was without
evidence of atherosclerosis. At the time it was thought the pt
suffered from cardiac vasospasm and not CAD. The pt was placed
on diltiazem, Imdur, and amlodipine. The pt followed up in
cardiology clinic [**5-25**] and at the time was feeling with only 2
lesss severe episodes of retrosternal chest pressure, [**4-12**], that
occurred spontaneously without exertion, lasting 10 min with
complete resolution. The pt had been able to participate in
aerobic exercise, 45 minutes and endorsed 40lbs wt loss while on
Weight Watchers program. The pt was last seen by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**2150-6-8**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**], at which time she was feeling well. At the
time she reported LE edema since initiating amlodipine.

This morning the pt was bringing her children to school. Family
notes that patient has had increased chest discomfort this week
and using nitroglycerin at work. Her daughter notes chest pain
this morning which resolved prior to taking her daughter to
school. EMS reports that arrived on scene with bystander CPR in
progress (approx 7:45). Arrest was confirmed. The pt was shocked
once. CPR was continued and on second analysis, no shock was
advised. At that time the pt was noted to move, Amiodarone 150mg
was loaded and subsequently transferred to an OSH.

On arrival to the OSH, (hx obtained by [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital ED
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1518**] via phone), initial vitals 108/55 HR 147,
Wt 99.7kg. The pt was intubated (two attempts made). HR ranged
from 123 to 151, with SBPs 108/55 to 174/74. 140's to 150's.
Exam was notable for pt as unresponsive but was reaching for the
tube. She did not respond to commandy prior to being intubated
with Succinylcholine 150mg, Versed 4mg, Vecuronium 10mg and put
on a propofol gtt. No acute EKG changes. Wbc 20. ck/trop neg.
CXR/CT of chest shows large aspiration pneumonia CT Head/CT
C-spine unremarkable. The pt was given Ceftiaxone 1gm,
Clindamycin 600mg, Azithromycin 500mg. 18G. Small lac to back of
head- going to get some staples prior to transfer. Vitals prior
to transfer were HR 124 117/57.

In the CCU, the patient is intubated. When propofol is weaned
patient moves all extremities however does not respond to
commands or follow directions.

On review of systems, unable to be obtained from patient. Family
reports that she was in her usual state of health and went to
the beach this past weekend. Besides chest pain episodes noted
above no other symptoms were reported by the patient. Family
notes patient to be a non reporter.

[**Month/Day/Year **] ([**2150-6-19**])
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Mild to moderate
mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Increased PCWP.

Upper Extremity Ultrasound ([**2150-6-25**])
Nonocclusive thrombus seen within one of the superficial veins,
the cephalic vein, in a segment of the left upper arm. There is
no evidence
of deep vein thrombosis in the left arm.

CXR ([**2150-6-25**])
In comparison with study of [**6-22**], there has been placement of a
pacemaker device with leads in the region of the right atrium
and apex of the right ventricle. The degree of pulmonary
vascular congestion has substantially improved. Mild blunting of
the right costophrenic angle persists. No evidence of acute
focal pneumonia or pneumothorax. Right subclavian catheter
extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
