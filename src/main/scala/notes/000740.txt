Decreased responsiveness

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old right-handed woman with history of
HTN, CAD s/p MI, and CHF who has had progressive cognitive and
physical decline over the past 5-6 months now transferred for
further evaluation of her mental status.  Her mental status had
started worsening in [**2158-11-1**] when she was admitted to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with group B Strep bacteremia possibly related to lung
infection.  Prior to this, she had been living alone
independently in her apartment.  She was discharged to a nursing
home in [**2158-12-2**].  She was transferred to a [**Hospital1 1501**] on [**2159-1-2**],
for worsening mental status, confusion, agitation, and
screaming.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] in [**2159-1-2**] for further
evaluation of agitation and mental status changes. During that
admission, she was found to have an Enterococcus positive UTI.
Then, she was admitted to [**Hospital 1191**] Hospital for further management
of her mental status changes which was attributed to increasing
anxiety.  She was prescribed trazadone.  She had further decline
in her mental status which was thought to be secondary to
psychosis so she was started on twice daily risperidone and
required a 1:1 sitter.  While at [**Doctor First Name 1191**], she developed a right
facial droop and was unresponsive. She was also noted to have
generalized muscular hypertonicity.   She was transferred to [**Hospital6 38673**] on [**2159-4-7**] to rule out stroke.  She was started
on
ASA PR.  Head CT did not show large territorial infarct or
intracranial hemorrhage.  In the ED at [**Hospital3 **], she received
a
dose of vancomycin and levoquin.  This was not continued as she
was afebrile and did not have a leukocytosis.  Cardiac enzymes
were negative times three.  She was consulted by neurology who
considered that she may be in a drug-induced state from the
risperidone.  However, it was felt that nonconvulsive status
epilepticus should also be ruled out.  Therefore, she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for bedside EEG monitoring to rule out
seizure.

ROS: per HPI. No recent fever.  She is noted to have
progressively worsening decline, both in mental status, in p.o.
intake, and also, to have depressive symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
Confusion

Ms. [**Known lastname 4223**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for diminished
responsiveness. She had recently been given risperidone which
was held on admission. On the morning after admission she was
alert and interactive with the team. She is very hard of hearing
which can contribute to confusion, but the most likely etiology
to her delerium was medication-induced. We suggested Seroquel 25
mg PRN as a substitiute if she becomes agitated. We spoke to her
daughter who requested that she not be hospitalized in the
future. She states that she has made her facilty aware of this
do not hospitalize order. There was no evidence of seizure on
exam and she was moving extremities well.
