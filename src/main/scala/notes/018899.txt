Imaging:
ECHO [**2152-5-4**]:
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular function. Ball and cage
mitral prosthesis with normal gradient and at least mild mitral
regurgitation. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with
severe tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Mild aortic regurgitation. Biatrial dilatation
with the right atrium being markedly dilated.
.
Splenic US [**2152-5-5**]:
FINDINGS: Transverse and sagittal images were obtained of the
spleen. The
spleen is enlarged measuring 16.2 cm. The splenic appearance is
unremarkable. No ascites is seen in the left upper quadrant.
IMPRESSION: Splenomegaly.
.
Colonoscopy [**2152-5-5**]:
Impression: Polyp in the proximal ascending colon (polypectomy)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
.
Colonoscopy [**2152-5-9**]:
Impression: There was blood throughout the colon making
visualization difficult. The mucosa was not examined.
There was a large blood clot in the proximal ascending colon at
the site of prior polypectomy. There was a clip buried within
the clot. The area was washed extensively but the clot could not
be removed. Biopsy forceps were used to try to remove the clot
but this was not successful. There was erythema and active
oozing seen at the superior aspect of the clot. (endoclip,
injection)
.
Colonoscopy [**2152-5-12**]:
Impression:Blood in the colon
The polypectomy site was identified by presence of clips. An
adherent clot was noted adjacent to the clips. Fresh bleeding
was noted from the base. The clot was removed by wash and
suction. A small visible vessel was noted. Three clips were
applied with successful hemostasis. 5 cc of epinephrine was
injected into the mucosa for hemostasis.
The rest of the colon was not fully examined.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
Polyp described as serrated adenoma requiring repeat colonoscopy
in 5 years given increased risk of finding of serrated polyp.

Discharge Labs:


Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo F pt with hx of rheumatic heart disease at age 7, s/p
mitral valve replacement ([**Doctor Last Name 1395**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] mechanical prosthesis)
[**2104**], complicated by mitral insufficiency, ? ball variance/and
or paravalvular leak, pulmonary hypertension and RV
failure,tricuspid insufficiency and normal LV function, admitted
for an elective colonoscopy with need for MAC anesthesia and
heparin bridging.
.
# Positive Colovantage test: Patient has not undergone routine
screening colonoscopy however she underwent the Colovantage
testing which came back as positive on [**2152-4-12**], indicating that
she has increased likelihood of colorectal cancer. She was
admitted for IV heparin bridge due to her mechanical valve (pt
must be anticoagulated; at high risk for thrombus) starting [**12-23**]
days after discontinuing her coumadin (stopped on [**4-30**]).
Colonoscopy performed on [**5-5**] under MAC anesthesia with removal
of a single sessile polyp in the ascending colon. Post procedure
her stay was complicated by bleeding, see below.
.
#Loose bloody stools: On [**5-7**], patient experienced loose stools
mixed with blood. Her coumadin was held, heparin initially
continued. Hct started to fall on [**5-8**] to 25 and she was given 2
units RBCs. Heparin was stopped and she was reprepped for a
colonscopy (#2). She
