MRCP [**2143-6-12**]:
1. Tip of pigtail in collapsed gallbladder with wall edema,
sludge and
gallstones. No gallbladder mass.
2. Small non-obstructing stone in the distal common bile duct.
ERCP is
recommended for further evaluation.
3. Bilateral areas of hypoenhancement in the kidney, concerning
for
hematogenous pyelonephritis but no abscesses at this time.
4. Bilateral pleural effusion and dependent atelectasis, worse
on the left.
5. Small amount of scattered ascites.
6. Multiple punctate subcapsular right hepatic arterial
enhancing liver
lesions, likely perfusion abnormalities and shunting.
7. Mild bilateral renal artery stenosis; however, arteries are
small, below limits of resolution to assess degree of narrowing.

8. Moderate degenerative changes at level L4-L5 with high signal
on T2 in the intervertebral disk at this level, not included on
post-contrast images.  Correlate with focal tenderness.

ERCP [**6-13**]:
There was a filling defect consistent with a 6 mm stone in the
lower third of the common bile duct.  Otherwise the biliary tree
was normal.  A sphincterotomy was performed.  The stone was
extracted successfully.  A post pyloric feeding tube was place
into the 4th part of the duodenum - the position was confirmed
fluoroscopically.  (Sphincterotomy, stone extraction, feeding
tube placement).  Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the
duodenum.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 87 year old man with a history of COPD and dementia
who was transferred from an OSH for high fevers. He was found to
have cholecystitis, gram negative bacteremia, and healthcare
associated pneumonia.
.
GRAM NEGATIVE BACTEREMIA/SEPSIS: Mr. [**Known lastname 85510**] had E.Coli bacteremia
at the OSH. His E.Coli was pansensitive. He was treated with
levofloxacin for 14 days. His fever curve and white count
eventually trended down throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course.  All
surveillance cultures were negative.
.
CHOLECYSTITIS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 85510**] originally presented to OSH with
signs/symptoms consistent with cholecystitis. The diagnosis was
confirmed radiologically at this hospital.  Mr. [**Known lastname 85510**] had a
percutaneous drain placed and was evaluated by surgery.  He
eventually went for an MRCP, which showed stones within the
gallbladder.  An ERCP was performed, during which time a 6mm
stone was removed and a sphincterotomy was performed.  Mr. [**Known lastname 85510**]
continued to have good drainage from his percutaneous biliary
drain.  He was initially started on vanc/zosyn/and levoquin.
This was tapered to a 14 day course of levofloxacin which he has
completed. He will need to follow up with surgery in 6 weeks
(beginning of [**Month (only) 205**], with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 5182**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5189**]).
.
HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATED PNA:  Mr. [**Known lastname 85510**] developed healthcare
associated pneumonia in setting of being a long-term resident in
a nursing home.  He had radiologic and clinical evidence of
pulmonary infection.  Moreover, thick, copious secretions were
suctioned from his respiratory tract during a bronchoscopy.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 85510**] was treated with 8 days of vanc/zosyn/and levoquin.
Moreover, Mr. [**Known lastname 85510**] was found to have sparse growth of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] in BAL. He was treated with Micafungin briefly.
