Service:  ACOVE

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old
female with coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2,
hypertension, and tongue cancer status post 35 cycles of XRT,
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with hyponatremia and loose stools who
returned two days after discharge with nausea, vomiting, and
continuing loose stools.  The patient's grandson was feeding the
patient her tube feeds this morning and the patient vomited times
one.  The patient does not remember the circumstances and cannot
elaborate further on the history.  She describes the vomit as her
tube feeds without blood.  She also complains of abdominal
discomfort describes as a "funny feeling".  She denied any
gas or abdominal pain.  She reports continuing loose stools
with the sensation of tenesmus.  The stool is described as
watery, light-colored, without blood or mucus.  She denied
any rectal pain, bright red blood per rectum or melena.  She
also denied fevers, chills, night sweats, shortness of
breath, chest pain, palpitations, cough.  The patient states
that she has not taken any food by mouth.  She also reports
no recent change in her tube feeds.  She has been taking all
of her medications per NG tube including her hydrochlorothiazide
which was recently discontinued during her last admission for
hyponatremia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.9, BP 112/60, pulse 97, respirations 20, 98% on room air.
General:  Well appearing, in no acute distress, no
respiratory distress.  HEENT:  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were intact.  White
exudate in mouth.  Evidence of some minimal breakdown of the
tongue mucosa.  The patient has an edematous lower lip with
blistering.  There is hyperpigmentation of her lower face.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2.  Abdomen:
Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.  The
patient's liver is palpated 2 cm below her right costal
margin.  Extremities:  No clubbing or cyanosis.  There was 1+
pitting edema in the bilateral lower extremities.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White blood cell count 11.5,
hematocrit 36.4, platelets 263,000, (neutrophils 84.4,
lymphocytes 6.7).  Sodium 126, potassium 4.3, chloride 88,
bicarbonate 28, BUN 19, creatinine 0.6, glucose 153, CK 29,
ALT 50, AST 50, total bilirubin 0.5, alkaline phosphatase 73,
LDH 180, albumin 3.8, amylase 47, lipase 57.

The U/A revealed negative nitrates, negative leukocytes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  PULMONARY:  The patient was completely
stable from a respiratory standpoint on admission; however,
on hospital day number three, had respiratory arrest with an
ABG of 7.15/82/33 and chest x-ray significant for asymmetric
pulmonary edema with question of aspiration pneumonia.  The
patient was intubated and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  The
patient improved rather rapidly from a respiratory standpoint
and was extubated on the following day.  She was started on
levofloxacin and vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia and when
her sputum culture grew MSSA pneumonia, her vancomycin was
stopped and she was continued on levofloxacin for a full
course.  The etiology of the patient's respiratory failure is
likely multifactorial.  It is considered likely that it was
triggered initially by aspiration pneumonia with hypertensive
urgency and subsequent flash pulmonary edema.

The patient remained afebrile throughout her hospitalization
with a normal white blood cell count and was maintained on
levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia.  Her pulmonary edema
occurred in the setting of hypertension and resolved on the
second day of her stay in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  It is likely that the
patient has an element of diastolic dysfunction with this
hypertensive crisis and she was diuresed with Lasix while in
the ICU.  There was also a question of possible mucus
plugging given the patient's thick secretions after XRT.  She
was maintained on humidified oxygen for mobilization of this
thick sputum.  Given slight wheezing on examination on
transfer back to the floor, the patient was started on
Albuterol for likely post pneumonia inflammation of her
airways.  She maintained good oxygen saturations on room air
once transferred to the floor and was completely stable from
a respiratory standpoint.

2.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was admitted with
abdominal discomfort with her tube feeds as well as loose
stools and elevated transaminase levels.  She had an
abdominal CT on the day following her admission which was
significant for a dilated common bile duct and was evaluated
by the ERCP fellow who consented the patient for ERCP.
However, on the following hospital day, the patient suffered
a respiratory arrest and was taken to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Throughout
the remainder of her hospital course, the patient's
transaminitis resolved and she did not complain of any
further "funny feeling" in her abdomen.  It was, therefore,
decided to hold off on the ERCP and readdress this issue at
some time in the future if the patient becomes symptomatic
once again.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was noted during her
respiratory arrest and brief stay in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to have
troponins peak to 0.36 with flat CKs and an uninterpretable
EKG secondary to left bundle branch block.  Given that she
experienced a troponin leak in the context of her
hypertensive crisis, it is likely that it represents demand
ischemia.  The patient was continued on her aspirin, beta
blocker, and ACE inhibitor.  There was a question of
congestive heart failure.  The patient was transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] given pulmonary edema and her respiratory arrest.  She
had an echocardiogram which was significant for normal left
ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of
55-70%.  It is likely that the patient has an element of
diastolic dysfunction and received several daily doses of
Lasix while in the ICU.

Her beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were continued, as
described above, and she was given several doses of Lasix on
the floor in order to maintain an even to negative fluid
balance.  The patient was admitted on an antihypertensive
regimen of propanolol, lisinopril, and Amlodipine.  This was
changed to metoprolol and lisinopril with doses titrated to
control her blood pressure.

4.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
admitted with difficulty tolerating her tube feeds.  Her tube
feed regimen was changed from boluses to continuous
concentrated tube feed which the patient tolerated.  The
patient will be discharged on continuous tube feeds at night
which will allow her to have increased mobility during the
day in the hopes that the continuous tube feeds will avoid
any abdominal discomfort.  The patient was also admitted with
hyponatremia in the context of restarting her hydrochlorothiazide
at home.  Her hydrochlorothiazide was held on admission and the
patient received normal saline with eventual resolution of her
hyponatremia.  It is likely that the patient's hyponatremia was
secondary to hydrochlorothiazide with an element of dehydration
contributing.

On transfer back to the floor, the patient had a video
swallow study which was significant for poor tongue movement
with
