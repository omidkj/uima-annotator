CT ABD/PELVIS: Triple phase to r/o Portal Vein Thrombosis
1. Large, heterogeneous mass involving the majority of the right
lobe of the liver. Tumor/thrombus with expansion within the
inferior vena cava extending to the right atrium.
2. Portal vein tumor/thrombus with lumen expansion and
occlusion. This constellation of findings is concerning for
large infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma.
3. Left lower lobe pulmonary embolism, not completely evaluated
on this CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
4. Ascites.
5. Bilateral pleural effusion.
6. Diffuse colitis extending from the cecum to the splenic
flexure.
Differential diagnosis includes infectious, venous congestion
and intramural hemorrhage.

CTA Chest ([**7-17**]):
1. Left basal artery pulmonary emboli.
2. Large heterogeneous mass in right lobe of the liver with
associated tumor thrombus in right atrium.


Brief Hospital Course:
HCC: Pt presented with epigastric discomfort, fecal
incontinence, and anemia. To evaluate this a CT of the abdomen
was done on [**7-16**], which incidentally showed an infiltrating
large heterogeneous mass involving the majority of the right
lobe of the liver. There was a filling defect with expansion of
the portal vein and and of the hepatic vein extending to the
inferior vena cava, consistent with tumor thrombus. The
thrombus extends superiorly into the right atrium. This was
presumed to be advanced stage Hepatocellular carcionma with
intravascualar extension, along with Budd-Chiari syndrome due to
occlusion of the portal vein. Pt was also found to have a LLL PE
which was confirmed by a CT chest. Thirdly, pt was found to have
diffuse colitis extending from the cecum to the splenic flexure.
Pt was started on a heparin drip due to the extensive clots,
which had already been c/b PE. Pt subsequently had hematemesis
pt was given 2 units PRBC, and did not become hypotensive.
.
Pt was transfered to the MICU with hematemesis for an EGD since
actively bleeding, did not require pressors. On EGD he was found
to have esophagitis and two non-bleeding varices. The Pt was
briefly intubated to airway protection in the context of
hematemesis. Pt had one subseqeuent epsisode of hematemesis of
100-150 cc in the ICU.  Patient had 2 episodes of hematemesis.
HCT 26.2 on admission then 23.4. Patient has been transfused
2uPRBC, and on protonix IV BID and octreotide gtt. Scope showed
Grade 2 non-bleeding gastric varices, esophageal varices likely
cause of bleed Once his hematemesis resolved he was restarted on
heparin for anticoagulation for his portal vein thrombosis and
PE. Pt left the ICU with hcts stable at around 30s. The cause of
the bleeding was attributed to the pt's esophageal varices
.
Pt was transferred to Liver service, and octreotide was stopped.
After discharge from the MICU until discharge pt did not have
any subsequent episodes of hematemesis at all. With pt's CT
findings and AFP 2178, Hepatocellular Carcioma was confirmed
without need of tissue diagnosis. Pt's HBV viral load was
negative (<60), and HBeAg (-), but HBeAb was (+). HCV was also
(-). Pt did however was HBsAg (+) confirming chronic hep B
status as the cause of pt's HCC. Hem/Onc followed for
consideration of treatment options. Since tumor had already
metastisized outside of liver pt's treatment options were
limited. Possible treatment with sorafenib (monoclonal ab as
chemotherapy that would extend survival for possibly weeks), but
at the time it was not safe to be started due to the increased
bleeding risk as an adverse effect of this medicaiton. The plan
was discussed in coordination with the Hem/Onc team. Two options
were presented. The first was to prolong survival as much as
possible - to do so pt would need multiple banding by EGD to
reduce risk of bleeding so that sorafinab could be given. The
family after discussion opted with the second option - to
preseve quality of life. The patient and family understood the
diagnosis and what would be involved. Thus pt's heparin was
discontinued, and heparin and lovenox were rejected as an idea.
Pt's protonix was converted to po, continued on sucrulfate, and
a bowel regimen. Pt also was started on simethcone for bloating.
Pt was also started on morphine for pain. Palliative care was
also consulted and further educated the family about about what
to expect.

LE edema: Pt also developed lower extremity edema and scrotal
swelling. This was thought secondary to the pt's IVC and portal
vein thrombosis along with ESRD. If the edema is primary due to
the thrombosis causing (vs. ESLD) diuretics may not
