[**2132-10-23**] 11:51 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage. There is a
probable subacute to chronic lacunar infarct within the left
corona radiata. A second, either subacute or chronic lacunar
infarct is seen within the left lentiform nucleus. Considering
patient age, there is the expected involutional change of the
brain parenchyma identified. There is moderate atherosclerotic
calcification of the cavernous portions of both internal carotid
arteries. No overt extracranial abnormalities are discerned.

CONCLUSION: No definite evidence for acute intracranial
pathology. However, in this regard, MRI scanning with
diffusion-weighted imaging, if feasible, is a more sensitive
imaging study in the detection of acute brain ischemia.

(W/FLUORO)  [**2132-10-23**] 11:00 AM

FINDINGS: Fluoroscopic examination of the patient's existing
feeding tube demonstrated the proximal portion to be coiled
within the pharynx. The distal tip was in the proximal stomach.
After unlooping the coil, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire was advanced, and
despite multiple maneuvers the tube could not be advanced into
the more distal portion of the stomach. The patient's left
nostril was then anesthetized with lidocaine jelly, and a new
feeding tube was advanced into the stomach under fluoroscopic
guidance. After this was accomplished, the right-sided feeding
tube was removed. The tube was then advanced under fluoroscopic
guidance through the pylorus and into the duodenum. The tube was
positioned at the ligament of Treitz. 5 cc of contrast were
injected through the tube demonstrating appropriate positioning
with the tip in the proximal jejunum. The tube was secured with
tape.

IMPRESSION: Successful placement of nasojejunal feeding tube
under fluoroscopic guidance.

[**2132-10-24**] 3:58 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP).

FINDINGS: The distal tip of the enteric feeding tube is no
longer visualized. The more proximal aspect, however, takes an
expected course through the mediastinum and left upper quadrant,
consistent with placement within the gastrointestinal tract. It
is likely advanced since the comparison study. Please refer to
the portable abdominal radiograph obtained for further details.
The study is of marginal diagnostic quality for lung evaluation
secondary to respiratory motion. A large bleb is evident in the
medial right lung base. Linear atelectasis is seen in the left
lung base. Grossly, no new consolidations are identified. No
significant edema is seen. The single lead right ventricular
pacemaker is stable in course and position. Likewise, there has
been no interval change in the course or position of a right
internal jugular approach central venous catheter device.

IMPRESSION: Apparent advancement of enteric feeding tube with
distal tip not visualized on chest x-ray examination. Please
refer to abdominal x-ray for further details. Marginal
diagnostic quality of study otherwise, however, no qualitative
significant interval change


Brief Hospital Course:
pt admitted

underwent a Left lower extremity and bilateral pelvic
arteriography of right external iliac angioplasty and stent
placement. Right to left fem-fem bypass.

receiving haldol, ativan and morphine for sedation

nuerology consulted - respiratory acidosis with renal
compensation / Head CT is normal

transfered to SICU for hemodynamic instability.
