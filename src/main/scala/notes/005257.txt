History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 100734**] is a 55 yo female with known mitral regurgitation
following a bout of endocarditis in [**2122**]. That was complicated
by embolic CVA and seizures. Over the last year, she has noted
increasing dyspnea on exertion with walking 20ft and during
flight of stairs. She has been followed closely with serial ECHO
and underwent cardiac MRI in [**2139-1-13**] with confirmed severe
MR with effective forward ejectin fraction of 25%. She has been
admitted for preoperative cardiac catheterization followed by
surgical intervention.

Past Medical History:
1. History of Preeclampsia ('[**22**])
2. SBE ('[**22**])
3. CVA ('[**22**]) - residual left sided weakness, difficulty with
decision making, ataxia, anosmia (improving), left arm
parasthesias
4. Seizures (started '[**22**], last one 8 yrs ago)
5. Depression
6. Mitral regurg/congestive heart failure
7. C-Sx ('[**22**])
8. s/p tubal ligation ('[**24**])
9. Bifrontal craniotomy with revision ('[**37**])

[**2139-9-1**] ECHO:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse. There is partial mitral
leaflet flail. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. An eccentric jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a small pericardial effusion.
[**2139-9-1**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
no coronary artery disease. 2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated
normal systemic arterial pressures. LVEDP was measured when the
JR4 catheter was inadvertently advanced into the LV. LVEDP was
elevated at 22 mmHg, consistent with elevated left sided filling
pressures. There was no transaortic gradient on pullback of
catheter from LV to aorta.

Wet Read: DSsd SUN [**2139-9-6**] 6:42 PM
Slightly decreased small bilateral pleural effusions. Unchanged
bibasilar
atelectasis.


Final Report
PA AND LATERAL CHEST

INDICATION: 55-year-old woman status post mitral valve repair.

COMPARISON: Multiple prior studies, most recent dated [**2139-9-4**].

FINDINGS: The degree of cardiomegaly and mediastinal widening is
stable.
Bilateral pleural effusions are slightly smaller. Bibasal
atelectasis is
present. Pulmonary vascularity is slightly increased, there is
no frank
pulmonary edema.

Right IJ catheter ends in the right atrium.

IMPRESSION:
1. Slight interval decrease in bilateral small pleural
effusions.
2. Bibasal atelectasis.


The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Stable
bifrontal encephalomalacia.


Final Report
INDICATION: 55-year-old woman status post MV repair. Rule out
bleed, acute
changes with confusion.

COMPARISON: [**2139-7-13**]. MR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 767**] [**2139-6-26**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: Unchanged appearance of extensive bifrontal
encephalomalacia with
volume loss and dilated lateral ventricular frontal horns, at
site of
extensive frontal craniotomy and cranioplasty. The previously
noted small left
parafalcine meningioma is not well visualized on non-contrast
study; however,
was better characterized on the MR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 767**] [**2139-6-26**].

There are no foci of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass
effect, or shift
of normally midline structures. There is no major vascular
territorial
infarct. Otherwise, the ventricles and sulci are normal in size
and
configuration and the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter differentiation is
well preserved.
A dense focus of high attenuation, probably calcification is
noted in the
right anterior temporal region (2A:18). Otherwise, the osseous
and soft
tissue structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, or acute major vascular
territorial
infarct.
2. Unchanged extensive bifrontal encephalomalacia, with volume
loss and
associated slight bilateral frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] dilation.
3. Previously noted left parafalcine meningioma is not well
characterized on
the current study; however, was recently well-seen on the MR
study from [**6-26**], [**2139**] (MR).

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
