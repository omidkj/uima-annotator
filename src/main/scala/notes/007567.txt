Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with a past medical history
including HTN, afib (not on coumadin or aspirin), carotid
stenosis, and cardiomyopathy who was found unresponsive in bed
at 2:45 PM on [**2180-8-26**].  She was initially taken to [**Hospital3 62353**] where she was thought to have an NIH stroke score of
26.  She was intubated for airway protection and transferred to
the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

At the time of her arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**], examination was notable
for unresponsiveness and significant left sided weakness.
Imaging revealed for a large right MCA infarct.

Although Ms. [**Known lastname **] had been intubated prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**],
further discussions with her health care proxy clarified her
code status as DNR/DNI.  Given her baseline dementia, underlying
comorbidities, and clinical status, the health care proxy
indicated the patient would not want ongoing or future active
medical intervention.  In accordance with her wishes, the Ms.
[**Known lastname **] code status was transitioned to comfort measures only and
she was extubated.  Supportive care was pursued to optimize the
patient's comfort.

With the support of her health care proxy, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was
discharged to hospice on [**2180-8-29**].
