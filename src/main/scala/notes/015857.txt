History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13621**] is a 67-year-old male smoker with a history of severe
emphysematous COPD (not on home O2, current smoker), recent
DVT/PE ([**1-1**]) now off coumadin, AAA, HTN, and multiple
admissions for pneumonia who was discharged yesterday after an
admission for a COPD exacerbation and who called EMS this
morning with shortness of breath and cough.

EMS found him with pursed lip breathing and placed him on BiPap.
He was given albuterol nebs and 2g Mag. In the ED, he was
afebrile with RR 26 BP 133/81 HR 107, 100%biPap. VBG was
7.30/66/101/34. He was given 125mg IV solumedrol, azithromycin,
and aspirin. ECG was reportedly normal. CXR did not show
infiltrate. Has 2 PIV.

He has been hospitalized multiple times for COPD exacerbation
and pneumonia requiring ICU admission earlier this week
(discharged yesterday). On his last admission, he was initially
on BiPap and weaned quickly to nasal cannula with albuterol and
atrovent nebs and a prednisone taper. Hospice was considered but
not initiated as the patient was not fully understanding of the
extent of his illness. He also has a prior intubation on a
single occasion in [**2131-9-23**]. His baseline activity level is
limited as he become very short of breath upon ambulating
several steps on level surface.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he continues to complain of shortness of
breath and cough. He states that he felt okay at the time of
discharge yesterday, but was awake all night coughing. His
breathing progressively worsened throughout the night and this
morning felt very short of breath so called EMS. He feels
slightly better while on BiPap. He does endorse mild dizziness
and mild confusion. He denies chest pain, does complain of right
sided back pain.

Chest xray
FINDINGS: The mediastinal, hilar and cardiac silhouettes are
unremarkable.  Stable bilateral hyperinflation with relative
lucencies of the upper lungs consistent with emphysematous
change. Stable biapical scarring. Minimal blunting of the right
costophrenic angle may be related to emphysematous change though
a small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No
pneumothorax. Vascular calcifications noted in the left neck
possibly within the left common carotid artery. Stable spinal
fusion hardware with fibular graft.
IMPRESSION: No acute process

Brief Hospital Course:
67-year-old M smoker with a history of severe COPD, prior PE/DVT
now off coumadin, AAA, and multiple admissions for pneumonia who
presents again with dyspnea, cough and is transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of COPD exacerbation requiring BiPAP.  Given
severity of his disease, goals were changed to symptom
management and he was discharged to hospice/comfort care.

#. COPD exacerbation:  Presentation on admission with change in
sputum production and worsening dyspnea, in the setting of an
extensive smoking history. No leukocytosis or focal
consolidation on CXR. He was initially treated with non-invasive
ventilation (BiPap) for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was
treated with a prednisone taper and standing nebulizer
treatments. He had not previously been on advair and was started
on advair discus. He completed a 5 day course of azithromycin.
He was weaned to nasal canula however his hospital course was
complicated by frequent episodes of respiratory distress and
hypoxia. After goals of care discussion with patient and family,
he was confirmed DNR/DNI and made it clear that he would not
want additional non-invasive ventilation in the future. He was
treated with morphine (changed to dilaudid for pruritis) to
relieve respiratory distress. His goals of care were changed to
focus on symptoms and he was discharged for comfort care.

#. Delirium: Patient became intermittantly agitated, pulling at
lines, climbing out of bed always in the setting of worsening
hypoxia and moderate respiratory distress. He was treated with
narcotics and non-rebreather in these episodes and gradually
improved. Patient received trazodone (one of his home meds) for
insomnia and became agitated and confused and this medication
was not resumed.  Delirium resolved by the time of discharge.

INACTIVE ISSUES
===============

#. Hx of DVT/PEs: Diagnosed with right segmental PE and LLE DVT
in [**12/2131**], coumadin stopped in [**2132-5-22**] in setting of concerns
related to medication adherence. Found to have non-occlusive
thrombus in left superficial femoral vein, anticoagulation not
restarted.

#. Osteoporosis: history of L1 and L3 compression fractures on
chronic opioids for pain relief, l3 compresion fracture. On
admission, patient reported intermittent right back pain pain
was controled with home dose of oxycodone/acetaminophen.

#. Steroid DM: Patient had elevated serum glucose in the setting
of steroid use. Has had elevated FSBG levels in the past while
on steroids.

#. Gout: Continue outpatient allopurinol
#. HLD: Held Lipitor during admission due to concurrent
