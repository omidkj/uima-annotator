have been removed. A left chest tube remains in unchanged
position at the base. No pneumothorax is seen.

The lungs are clear. No CHF. Small bilateral effusions appear.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic
arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]S.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.


PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
No PR.
Dilated main PA. Dilated branch PA.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
Pre Bypass: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. LVEF >60%. Right ventricular is mildly enlarged with
normal function. The right atrium is mildly enlarged.. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The main pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch
pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is a large echogenic mass
seen in the right main pulmonary artery about 2-3 cm distal to
the branchpoint. It is visible both on TEE and epicardial echo.
There is a small amount of flow around the mass. There is a
small pericardial effusion.
Epiaortic scan was completed at sites of crossclamp,
cannulation, and proximal grafts. There was a small flat plaque
on the posterior wall near the proposed site of cannulation, but
otherwise the sites were clear of plaques.

Post Bypass: Preserved biventricular function. LVEF >60%. There
is no longer a mass in the right main pulmonary artery, although
the borders appear somewhat irregular at the site of the
previous mass. Flow is nonturbulent in the main and branch
pulmnary arteries. Aortic contours are intact. Remaining exam is
unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of
the exam.

Acute, partially occlusive thrombus involving left common
femoral vein, possibly extending proximally, no thrombus
identified in the superficial femoral or popliteal veins in the
left.

Hematology Service
Addendum by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 58621**], MD, PHD on [**2181-5-15**]:
Attending: Asked to see this patient for a possible
hypercoagulable state. Patient interviewed, examined, past hx
and
labs reviewed. This is an 81 yo man with a recent history of a
CABG procedure during which time he was found to have a large
pulmonary embolus, removed by embolectomy. He also had a left
common femoral vein clot. Patient had taken coumadin in the
past.
Physical exam shows only rhonchi lower lung fields bilaterally,
no adenopathy or organomegaly.

Labs: WBC 10.8, Hgb 9, Plat 154,000, aPTT 60, INR 1.3-1.4,
Creast
1.4

Impression: Cardiovascular disease with recent PE and DVT, now
on
coumadin. Given that he will likely need continual
anticoagulation for his severe PE, I do not see the purpose of a
workup for a hypercoag state at this time, as this will not
change his future treatment, which is likely to be lifelong
anticoagulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 58622**] was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2181-5-11**]
for surgical management of his coronary artery disease. He was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. On [**2181-5-12**], he was
taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to three vessels as well as a pulmonary embolism
thrombectomy given that the intraoperative echo revealed a
pulmonary embolus. Please see operative report for further
details.  He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. A lower
extremity ultrasound was performed which showed a left common
femoral deep vein thrombosis. The vascular surgery service was
consulted and IVC filter was inserted.  On postoperative day
one, he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated. A Beta blocker, aspirin and a statin were
resumed. The hematology service was consulted given his
hypercoagulable state. It was recommended as he had already
received heparin in the setting of an acute thrombus, that a
hypercoagulable work-up be performed as an outpatient as results
would be unreliable at this time. Likely, lifelong
anticoagulation would be recommended. Heparin as a bridge to
coumadin was continued for anticoagulation. On postoperative day
