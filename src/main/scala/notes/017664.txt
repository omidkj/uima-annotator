Chief Complaint:
Atrial Fibrilliation /SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary Vein Isolation procedure


History of Present Illness:
57M with multiple cardiac risk factors (prev MI, CABG, FH of
IHD, Hyperlipidemia, HTN) presents post elective PVI with
significant HTN onweaning sedation admitted to r/o intracranial
event.
.
Patient is a 57 year old male with a history of CAD s/p
CABG in [**2139**], PCI of SVG-PDA in [**2148**], atrial fibrillation
(diagnosed in [**2-4**]) on coumadin who had progressive increase of
shortness of breath and was found to have congestive heart
failure with an EF of 20% with severely decreased left
ventricular systolic function. This was thought to be due to
tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy as his EF was normal until
now. He underwent successfull PVI today with conversion to NRS.
After the procedure while they were weaning off sedation, with
propofol, but he was not responding appropriately and was found
to have SBP in the 200's mmHg (BP 90-100's during procedure).
This was thought to have caused flash pulmonary edema, he was
given lasix 20 mg IV x2, hydralazine 5 mg IV, started on a nitro
gtt and propofol was re-started. He quickly responded with SBP
lowering to 80-90 but it was decided to maintain him intubated
and sedated until an acute intracranial process was ruled out.
.
On admission to CCU he was intubated, sedated with SBP in the
80's. Post-procedure CT-head revealed no intracranial pathology.
Sedation was weaned and he was safely extubated at 00:30.
Normalneurological exam.

Reports
.
CT Head [**6-9**]:
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or mass
effect.
There is preservation of normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation. The
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. There
is mild
mucosal thickening of the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses, and
opacification of
multiple ethmoid air cells, which could be related to the
endotrachial
intubation.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of an acute intracranial abnormality.



Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo male with CAD s/p CABG and PCI, AF, possible tachycardia
induced cardiomyopathy, who underwent successful pulmonary vein
isolation but was unable to be extubated after procedure due to
episode of significant hypertension and flash pulmonary edema on
weaning sedation. Successfully extubated and appears well.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Pt with symptomatic AF since [**2150-1-26**].
Initiated on Coumadin at that time. INR today 3.1 on [**6-9**]. The
PVI successful - converted to SR. INR was 3.2 [**6-10**] and he was
continued on warfarin.
.
#Hypertension while lightening sedation and pulmonary edema. He
was safely extubated with no neurological deficits. His CT-head
was normal. We repeated his chest X ray as well and monitored
his hemodynamics. His urinary catheter was removed and he was
given bolus 40mg IV Lasix to encourage urination. The lasix was
continued p.o as outpatient.
.
# Dyslipidemia:
- Continued Simvastatin 80mg daily
.
# Cardiomyopathy/ Chronic HF: Prev MI, recently found to have an
EF
20% on echocardiogram with severely decreased left ventricular
systolic function. Pt reports SOB with minimal activity.
We Continued Metoprolol 50mg daily, Lisinopril 10mg daily,
Furosemide 40mg daily
.
FEN:
- Low Na diet, daily weights, monitor I+O's. IV KCL sliding
scale was carried out.
.
ACCESS: PIV's
.
PROPHYLAXIS:
-DVT ppx with TEDs. There was  no need for sc heparin as INR
3.5.

- Discharged home on [**6-10**].
