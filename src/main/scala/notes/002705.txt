Mild shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2103-1-24**] Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Repair utilizing a 38mm
Annuloplasty Band


History of Present Illness:
This is a 43 year old female with known heart murmur since age
25. She has been followed by serial echocardiograms which have
shown worsening mitral regurgitation with increasing left
ventricular dimensions. She therefore has been referred for
cardiac surgical intervention. Most recent ECHO from [**Month (only) **]
[**2102**] revealed severe MR, dilated LV, EF of 55% and only trace
TR. Subsequent cardiac catheterization confirmed 4+ MR. Coronary
angiography showed clean coronary arteries.

Past Medical History:
Mitral Regurgitation

Social History:
Denies tobacco history. Admits to only social ETOH. She lives
with her daughter. She is a high school teacher. Denies IVDA.

Family History:
Denies premature CAD. Father currently alive in his 70's,
suffers from heart failure and diabetes.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: BP 130-140/86-88, HR 84, RR 12
General: well developed female in no acute distress
HEENT: oropharynx benign,
Neck: supple, no JVD,
Heart: regular rate, normal s1s2, 4/6 systolic murmur left lower
sternal border
Lungs: clear bilaterally
Abdomen: soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds
Ext: warm, no edema, no varicosities
Pulses: 2+ distally

Pertinent Results:
[**2103-1-29**] Chest x-ray: A small right apical pneumothorax is
unchanged in size, with visceral pleural line overlying the
right third posterior rib level. Subcutaneous emphysema is again
demonstrated in the right axilla. Multifocal areas of discoid
atelectasis in the left mid and both lower lung regions have
slightly improved, and a small left pleural effusion has not
changed.

INDICATION: Pneumothorax.

A small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged in size, with
visceral pleural line overlying the right third posterior rib
level. Subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated in the right
axilla. Multifocal areas of discoid atelectasis in the left mid

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

Pre-CPB study performed to rule out LSVC/ASD and severe aortic
atheroslcerosis.
Retrograde coronary sinus and Pulmonary artery vent cannulae
placed under TEE
guidance and postions conformed.
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
in the body
of the LA. Depressed LAA emptying velocity (<0.2m/s) All four
pulmonary veins
identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is
seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Moderately dilated LV cavity. Low normal LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior
- normal;
basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal
anterolateral
- normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal;
septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex -
normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no
atherosclerotic plaque. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal
descending
aorta diameter. No thoracic aortic dissection.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets. Moderate/severe
MVP. Partial
mitral leaflet flail. Severe (4+) MR. Eccentric MR jet.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the

anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient was
under general
anesthesia throughout the procedure.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast
is seen in the body of the left atrium. The left atrial
appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or
color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending,
transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic
plaque. No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There
is
moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse. There is partial mitral
leaflet flail.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation jet is
eccentric. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
First Attempt: Severely hypokinetic LV inferiro and spetal walls
with
mioderately hyokinetic RV free wall and severe hypotension
requiring
re-institutuion of full CPB.

2nd Attempt:
Improved biventricular systolic function. EF = 55%
Annuloplasty ring in mitralposition, trace MR, and no
significant
transmitralor LVOT gradient.
After thorough de-airing of the LV and LA and with background
inotropic
support, the focal and global LV aand RV function gradually
improved allowing
separation from CPB.

Posterior annuloplasty ring in mitral positon, well seated and
mecahnically
stable. Trace MR and no sigfnificant gradient across the mitral
valve.
LV and RV function returned to baseline.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted and underwent a minimally invasive mitral
valve repair by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]. There were no complications and
following the operation, patient was brought to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. Her CSRU course was
uneventful and she transferred to the SDU on postoperative day
one. Chest tube was left in for several days secondary to
persistent serosanginous drainage. Chest tube was eventually
removed with resultant small right apical pneumothorax which
remained stable by serial chest x-rays. Postoperatively, she
also required several units of packed red blood cells for
anemia. Following blood transfusions, her hematocrit improved
from 18 to 26%. Postoperatively, she remained in a normal sinus
rhythm. Some premature atrial beats were noted on telemetry for
which beta blockade was initiated and slowly advanced as
tolerated. No episodes of atrial fibrillation were note
