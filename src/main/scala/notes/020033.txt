Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness and Low Blood Pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
60 yo F with ESRD on HD, DM1, CAD s/p CABG [**2121**], CHF EF 30%(s/p
ICD) who was sent to ED from dialysis after experiencing
hypotension and dizziness. She had been treated with cefazolin
[**Date range (1) 19770**] and Vanc [**Date range (1) 19503**] at HD for positive Coag neg staph
bacteremia. On [**2138-10-16**], patient underwent exchange over a wire
of left femoral tunneled hemodialysis catheter because of
persisent bacteremia with coag negative staph.

.

In the ED, initial VS: 98.7 94 105/47 18 97% 2L on SBP 75-80.
FSBG low. Refusing central lines, refusing labs, got 22G in arm.
Given Got vanco in ED. CXR unchanged. VS: 98.6 82 100/33 12.

.

Currently, patient reported fatigue and some nausea at dialysis.
She reported that the antibiotics made her feels sick. She
reportst that normally her blood pressures run low SBP in
70-80s. She reports poor appetie and poor PO intake over the
weekend.  Her boyfriend reports that she has had nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea in the past 3 weeks after dialysis. Also
she reports a lesion on her finger.

.

ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, constipation, BRBPR,
melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

initially 2.5 but is now 1.8. Does make urine still; urinates

1x/day.

thrombosis in [**11-6**], but was asymptomatic at that
time)-maintained on coumadin

CXR [**10-20**]
1. Femoral dialysis catheter tip advanced to the junction of the
SVC and right atrium. Please correlate for positional adequacy.
2. Cardiomegaly.
.
Echo [**10-21**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-9-27**], no
vegetations are seen.

CT Scan [**2138-10-22**]
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized
thorax, there
is a small left pleural effusion and associated relaxation
atelectasis.
Atelectatic changes are also seen at the right lung base, though
some regions
suggest possibility of aspiration as well. The heart is top
normal in size.
There are dense coronary artery calcifications. There is no
pericardial
effusion.

There is a small amount of pneumoperitoneum with the bulk of
free air located
anterior to the liver. Locules of gas seen anteriorly throughout
the abdomen
and inferiorly to below the pelvis (series 2, image 57).

In the abdomen, evaluation of the solid organs is limited
without intravenous
contrast. Linear regions of low density adjacent to calcified
hepatic
arteries, particularly in the left [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be dilated bile
ducts. The
atrophic pancreas, spleen, and adrenals appear normal. Vessels
are densely
calcified suggesting diabetes. Both kidneys are again atrophic.

There is distention of small bowel loops to 2.7 cm (series 300B,
image 10).
There is effacement of fat about the small bowel and thickened
walls in the
upper loops of bowel. Small locules of air also seen in the
superior and
anterior central small bowel loops (series 2, image 39). No
definite
pneumatosis is seen.

There is effactment of fat about large bowel. Bowel wall
thickness is
difficult to establish without oral contrast but appears
abnormal the
descending colon. There is a locule of gas abutting a portion of
hepatic
flexure of the colon (series 2, image 39). Fluid is seen
adjacent to the
descending colon towards the sigmoid (series 2, image 51; series
300B, image
22).

There is no pathologic abdominal lymphadenopathy. The takeoffs
of the celiac
and superior mesenteric arteries are densely calcified as are
all the
intra-abdominal vessels
