Chief Complaint:
Transfer for slow VT, hemodynamically stable

None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 82 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, HTN, HL, IDDM, sCHF
(EF 30%) s/p ICD/pacemaker admitted to an OSH ([**Hospital3 19345**]) on [**2136-5-10**] with increasising seizure activity at his
nursing home. He was transferred from the OSH to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU
on [**2136-5-14**] for evaluation of ?slow VT causing his seizures. This
was ruled out by EP while he was in the CCU after pacer
interrogation, and he was transferred to medicine overnight for
further work-up of his seizure activity and for diuresis in the
setting of a CHF exacerbation.
Briefly, the patient was recently diagnosed with seizure
activity and is followed by an OSH neurologist, currently on
Keppra. He had multiple (at least 3) witnessed seizures at the
[**Hospital 582**] [**Hospital **] Nursing Home on [**5-10**], and with each seizure
his post-ictal phase was noted be more prolonged. He was sent
into the OSH for evaluation. There he was consulted on by
nephrology for acute on chronic renal failure (2.4 on admission,
baseline 1.6-1.7) and cardiology, and his outpt neurologist was
to be consulted -- in the interim his keppra was kept at 500 mg
PO BID on discharge to [**Hospital1 18**]. Cardiology was concerned he was
having 'slow VT' and his PPM was therefore not set to fire
because it was not above threshold and started him on an
amiodarone gtt. He also may have been off of his amiodarone
which was appears to have been started during his last [**Hospital1 18**]
discharge but per the OSH cardiology note may have been stopped
around the beginning of [**Month (only) 116**]. He was reloaded with IV amiodarone
at the OSH with plan to resume oral amiodarone at 400 mg PO
daily and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for further
evaluation of his 'slow VT'. Also noted to have an E. coli UTI
noted at OSH.

In the CCU, the patient was evaluated by EP for this question of
slow VT. His pacer was interrogated and shown to have 1 episode
of VT for 10 minutes but likely the tachycardia was AF w/ RVR
did not explain his seizures. ICD was re-programmed by EP. He
was given diuresis with IV lasix for his volume overload.
Ciprofloxacin was also started for his UTI. He was called out to
medicine and per report had a bed at 10 pm on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 7 but was not
seen by a nightfloat resident overnight due to a
misccommunication about whether the CCU was going to continue to
follow the patient on the floor. He was immediately evaluated by
MS IV and senior resident this morning.

Per discussion with his dtr [**Name (NI) 1453**] (HCP), the patient has had
declining quality of life since [**2136-1-24**] including multiple
hospitalizations (one in [**1-/2136**] leading to [**Hospital1 18**] transfer in
[**2-/2136**], another in [**3-/2136**], and then the most recent on [**2136-5-10**])
for ?syncope versus seizure. HCP and her sister and mother have
been taking care of him exclusively for the past 6-8 months
since his health started deteriorating. He likely has been
having seizure activity since [**Month (only) 956**]. After his initial
discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2-/2136**], he was admitted to [**Hospital 5130**]
Rehab for one month, then to [**Location (un) 582**] in [**Location (un) 7658**] and then was at
home for 9 days. He was having frequent falls at home and so was
re-admitted to LGH in [**2136-3-23**]. He was set up with a
neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9590**] at that time who believes his seizures
are due to demented, atrophied brain and is more susceptible to
siezures as a result. His Keppra was increased from 750 mg PO
BID to 1000 mg PO BID at his [**2136-4-3**] outpatient neurology visit.
The dtr reports that while he was at home, he was having
frequent falls and his BS was 14 by EMS on this way to the
hospital for the LGH [**2135-3-24**] admission, [in the setting of
PCP changing [**Name9 (PRE) 8472**] 36 U QHS to Humalog 70/30 for cost
improvement] so hypoglycemia may have been a contributing to his
seizure activity as well. Neurologist recommended that if his
seizures persisted to be seen by an epileptologist and have 24
hour EEG evaluation potentially. The patient was recently
discharged to [**Location (un) 582**] in [**Location (un) **] and was only there for a few
days before the seizure activity that prompted this current
admission was noted by the staff and the dtr (described as
talking, lying in bed, then suddenly becoming stiff, with
jerking movements of hands and legs, neck thrown back, not
responsive, then after seizure was progressively more post-ictal
for longer periods of time). During that admission, Dtr also
reports that at one point he was transferred to the ICU and made
CMO and ICD was turned off, but then he recovered and looked
much better the next day, so decision was made to restart his
ICD and transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for futher evaluation of slow VT. Of
note, dtr states father's quality of life has been
deteriorating, and that he has stated in the past that he would
not want to be maintained by artifical means such as breathing
tubes or feeding tubes and has stated to his family that he
would want 'nature to take it's course if it was his time'. His
outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 89513**] did mention hospice to
the family given that his CHF is end stage. The dtr is agreeable
to further discussing this during this hospitalization and
agreed to DNR/DNI code status this admission.

On the floor the patient is sleepy but easily arousable, but
AOx3 ('[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 28331**]', [**Hospital1 18**], [**2136-5-15**], [**Last Name (un) 2753**]) but
attention is waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] and he is unable to sustain
attention to answer questions. He has no memory of the seizure
activity.
