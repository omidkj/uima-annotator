was playing bingo when she lost consciousness, was helped to the
ground (no trauma). She was taken to an OSH, where she was noted
to have a right gaze deviation, R>L pupils, and left
hemiparesis.
On EMS arrival she vomited x 2. She was intubated at midnight

HEENT: coffee ground emesis from NGT
Neck: no bruits

Reflexes: 1 throughout, with 1+ in left triceps, toes mute
bilaterally.


Pertinent Results:
CT-head - non-contrast [**2182-10-16**]
IMPRESSION: Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered within
the right basal ganglia and thalamus with extension into the
right midbrain, pons, and frontoparietotemporal lobes concerning
for hypertensive hemorrhage. Underlying mass or vascular
malformation remain diagnostic possibilities.
There is 1.4 cm right to left midline shift and right uncal
herniation.

Brief Hospital Course:
76F with likely HTN amd right sided hemorrhage involving:
right midbrain, pons, and frontoparietotemporal lobes.

ICH score calculated:
Would have been a 5 of 6 for volume greater than 30cc, GCS 4
(two points), infratentorial involvement, and IVH.  She did not
get points for age>80.  The family was appraised of studies
which showed that patients with such a high ICH score have a
very high risk of death within 30 days. The family decided to
make the patient CMO on the second day of admission.  She was
extubated and expired shortly thereafter.
