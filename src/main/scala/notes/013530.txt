Pertinent Results:
[**12-26**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Post OP
CABG: No change in ventricular or ventricular function during
anf after the off-pump LIMA to LAD anastomosis
[**12-22**] CT: 1. 4-mm right upper lobe irregular opacity could be
atelectasis, scarring adjacent to old impaction or a growing
lesion, should be followed in six months. One followup should be
sufficient to exclude a growing lesion. 2. Severe ascending
aorta calcifications. No aortic valvular calcification. 3.
Displaced descending aortic calcification could be due to old
dissection versus calcified thrombus. 4. Mild volume overload,
bilateral small pleural effusion and dependent atelectasis.
Small pericardial effusion. 5. Moderate emphysema and diffuse
bronchial wall thickening, suggesting chronic bronchitis. 6.
4-mm right upper lobe irregular opacity could be atelectasis,
scarring adjacent to old impaction or a growing lesion, should
be followed in six months. One followup should be sufficient to
exclude a growing lesion. 7. Kidney punctate calcifications, old
scarring and hypodensities, should be evaluated by ultrasound,
incompletely evaluated in this study.
[**12-22**] Carotid U/S: 1. 60-69% stenosis in the right internal
carotid artery. 2. 80-99% stenosis in the left internal carotid
artery.

Final Report
HISTORY: Check pneumothorax.

CHEST, TWO VIEWS.

The lungs are hyperinflated and diaphragms flattened, consistent
with COPD.
The patient is status post sternotomy. There is mild
cardiomegaly, with
calcified unfolded aorta. There is a small-to-moderate sized
left
pneumothorax, with a small left effusion, consistent with a
hydropneumothorax.
Compared with [**2163-12-28**] at 13:32 p.m., the left apical
pneumothorax is somewhat
larger. There is mild prominence of interstitial markings, which
may reflect
background parenchymal scarring. There is a tiny right effusion.
There is
minimal patchy increased retrocardiac density, essentially
unchanged, without
frank consolidation. This likely represents some residual
atelectasis.

IMPRESSION:

Slight interval increase in the size of the left pneumothorax,
with small left
effusion (hydropneumothorax).

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname 57323**] was transferred from an
[**Hospital 81542**] hospital for coronary bypass surgery. Upon admission she
was appropriately worked up for surgery. During physical exam
her right lower extremity (right femoral artery used for cath)
appeared to be cooler to touch with no distal pulses and absence
of Doppler signal. Vascular surgery was consulted due to
presumed ischemic right leg. She was emergently taken to the
operating room for right groin exploration with femoral
thrombectomy, iliofemoral endarterectomy and right external
iliac stenting. Please see operative note for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU. She was
continued on a Heparin drip and on post-op day one she was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. Patient
remained stable while recovering on the floor for several days
with daily input from vascular. Additional tests were performed
(CT and carotid u/s), please see reports for details. On [**12-26**]
she was brought back to the operating room where she underwent a
off pump coronary artery bypass graft. Please see operative note
for surgical details. Following surgery she was transferred to
the CVICU for invasive monitoring.

She was transferred to the step down floor on POD 1. Chest tubes
and pericardial wires were removed per usual protocol. She was
gently diuresed towards her pre-operative weight. Physical
therapy was consulted to work on strength and mobility.  She
continued to improve and was discharged to rehab on #4 in stable
condition.
