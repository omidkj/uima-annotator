Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2153-10-11**] Three Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(left
internal mammary to diagonal artery, vein grafts to left
anterior descending and obtuse marginal) and Mitral Valve Repair
utilizing a 27mm Duran AnCore Band


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 68603**] is a 57 year old female with congestive heart
failure. She was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) **]
[**2152**] for an NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization and echocardiogram
at that time revealed severe three vessel disease, severe mitral
regurgitation, an LVEF of [**10-14**]%, and left ventricular thrombus.
She also underwent cardiac MR which showed the LV foward
ejection fraction of 19%. Workup was also notable for a right
upper lobe slightly spiculated 10-mm lung overlying the 6th
intercostal space, worrisome for lung cancer. She was eventually
discharged and placed on Warfarin for the LV thrombus with plans
for cardiac surgical intervention in the near future.

She was admitted on [**10-9**] for Warfarin washout and
heparinization, along with routine preoperative workup and
further evaluation for lung nodule.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: BP 109/66, HR 70, RR 14, SAT  99% on room air
General: thin female in no acute distress
HEENT: oropharynx benign,
Neck: supple, no JVD, bilateral carotid bruits noted
Heart: regular rate, normal s1s2, no murmur or rub
Lungs: clear bilaterally
Abdomen: soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds
Ext: warm, no edema, no varicosities
Pulses: 2+ distally
Neuro: nonfocal


Pertinent Results:
[**2153-10-9**] CT Scan: 1. Spiculated 11-mm right upper lobe lung
nodule concerning for neoplasm. There is also associated
precarinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. No evidence of
metastases. 2. Mild centrilobular emphysema. 3. Mild tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacification in the right lower lobe is nonspecific and may be
due to superimposed infection, inflammation, or atelectasis. 4.
Diverticulosis.

[**2153-10-11**] TEE: 1 - PRE-BYPASS:  Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed with an estimated EF of 15-20 %.
No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Resting regional wall
motion
abnormalities include akinesis of inferior and inferoseptal
walls. The remaining left ventricular segments are hypokinetic.
There is an apical left ventricular  aneurysm  The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild MAC. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.  2 - POST-BYPASS:
Well-seated annuloplasty ring in the mitral position. No
paravalvular leak. Trace MR. There is no evidence of [**Male First Name (un) **]. There
is improvement of the overall LV function. LVEF 25-30%. The
aortic contour post decannulation is normal.

[**2153-10-13**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: No hydrocephalus, shift of
normally midline structures, intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage,
or acute major vascular territorial infarct is identified on
these limited views. No fractures are seen. Imaged sinuses are
clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 68603**] was admitted and underwent further evaluation which
included dental consultation, CT scan for pulmonary nodule and
carotid ultrasound for bilateral carotid bruits. Dental
consultation found evidence of several tooth fractures and
recommended several tooth extractions. Full body CT scan was
notable for a spiculated 11-mm right upper lobe lung nodule
concerning for neoplasm with associated precarinal and bilateral
hilar lymphadenopathy. There was no evidence of metastases. CT
scan also revealed mild centrilobular emphysema and
diverticulosis. Carotid ultrasound showed a 60-69% stenosis of
the left internal carotid artery. The right internal carotid
artery was normal. The carotid ultrasound also found evidence of
right-sided subclavian steal. Given the above results, tooth
extractions will be arranged postoperatively, and she will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**](Thoracic Surgery) as an outpatient
after she recovers from her upcoming cardiac surgery. Given only
moderate carotid disease, no intervention was indicated. Her
preoperative course was otherwise uneventful and she was cleared
for surgery.

On [**10-11**], she underwent a mitral valve repair and
coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. There were no
complications and she transferred to the CSRU in stable
condition. For further surgical details, please see seperate
dictated operative note. Within 24 hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. She weaned from
inotropic support and transferred to the SDU on postoperative
day one. Late on postoperative day two, she experienced altered
mental status, aphasia, nausea and vomiting, along with
decreased left sided movements. She was hypotensive at that time
with a systolic blood pressure in the 70's. She was started on
intravenous Dopamine and emergently underwent head CT scan which
found no obvious evolving large territorial infarction. She
returned to the CSRU for continued pressor support and started
on intravenous Heparin. As her hemodynamics improved with
pressor support and several blood tranfusions, her neurological
status also improved. She was seen by neurology who felt that it
was due to hypetension and that her symptoms were related to
hypoperfusion in the setting of known carotid disease and
subclavian steal. Her aphasia and left sided weakness completely
resolved. She gradually became more alert and oriented over the
next 24 hours. She weaned from pressor support and returned to
the SDU on postoperative day four. She continued on coaumadin
and heparin for LV thrombus, afib and at the recommendation of
neurology.She continued to do well and was ready for discharge
on POD #7.
