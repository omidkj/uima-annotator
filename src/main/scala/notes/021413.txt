.
[**2187-11-14**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular function. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
.
[**2187-11-14**] CT head: IMPRESSION:
1. Widespread ground-glass attenuation likely represents
pulmonary edema as reported on serial chest radiographs, but
superimposed asymmetrical foci of consolidation in the lower
lobes and 2 small nodules raises the concern for coexisting
pulmonary infection.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and anasarca.
3. Over distention of endotracheal tube cuff.
.
[**2187-11-15**] Liver/Gallbladder US: No evidence of a distended
gallbladder to suggest cholecystitis. However, gallbladder is
not well visualized; likely contracted. No history of
cholecystectomy could be elicited from CareWeb. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3766**] was
paged to discuss these findings at 1:45 p.m.
.
[**2187-11-18**] MRI Head:IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in the large right frontal
intraparenchymal
hematoma, 3.8x3.4cm subacute in stage with surrounding edema,
peripheral
nodular hyperintense areas and mild mass effect on the frontal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
right lateral ventricle.
2. No new hemorrhage or acute infarction.
3. Patent major intracranial arteries without focal
flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm more than 3 mm
within the resolution of MR angiogram.
4. Diminutive right distal vertebral artery, likely related to
hypoplasia or normal variant (effective PICA termination); left
fetal PCA.
5. Moderate amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells on both
sides and small amount in the left side of the sphenoid sinus.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 52F with OCD (stable recently, but h/o OD, anorexia and
alcohol use in past), ileostomy, GERD with delayed gastric
emptying, who presented to [**Hospital3 3765**] on [**10-28**] with nausea
and dizziness. There she was initially dx'd with dehydration,
ARF and UTI but then found to have ALT of 25,370 and of AST
11,490, total bili of 2.0, INR of 4.0, Cr of 3.0. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
She had been having fevers for ~10 days. On [**10-23**] she went to her
PCP who diagnosed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] UTI (grew klebsiella) and was taking
Bactrim. She continued to have general malaise and fevers
despite bactrim and asa. On [**10-28**] she called her PCP who
recommended some tylenol. Per husbands report she took 650mg x2
before coming in to the ED on [**10-28**]. There she was initially dx'd
with dehydration, ARF and UTI. She was given home doses of
simvastatin and SSRIs, but then found to have ALT of 25,370 and
of AST 11,490, total bili of 2.0, INR of 4.0, Cr of 3.0. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. On presentation initial vs were: 97.5 P89,
112/37 19 99%RA 37kg.
.
Initially the patient was treated in the MICU. She was thought
to be in hyperacute fulminant liver failure either secondary to
Bactrim reaction versus acetaminophen toxicity - tylenol level
peaked at 10.0 >24 hrs after last ingestion. She became
progressively obtunded, with significant encephalopathy
requiring intubation and ventilatory support. Her liver function
was notable for transaminases with an ALT and AST of 9500 and
17,500 respectively and worsening hyperbilirubinemia. She became
progressively more coagulopathic, and it was thought that she
was most likely going to need orthotopic liver transplantation
for survival. She was transfered to the SICU and transplant
team. Her liver function spontaneously improved over the course
of 2 weeks. This was evidenced by progressive ability to
metabolize her lactate, stabilization of her blood sugars, and
autocorrection of her coagulopathy.
.
During her stay in the SICU, she required respiratory
ventilation, vasopressors for hypotension and intracranial
pressure monitoring. The patient initially had blood pressure
support with the use of vasopressors in order to minimize her
intravascular volume which was t
