Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
right hip pain, s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right acetabular ORIF
PICC line placement, and removal


History of Present Illness:
81F with history of DMII, HTN, Hyperthyroidism and COPD who
presents after a fall.  The patient does not remember the
details of fall, but patient told daughter that she tripped and
fell at home into a plate of glass. She hit the right side of
her forehead and hit her right elbow and hip. No post ictal
state, no incontinece of bowel or bladder.  She also denies
lightheadedness, vision changes, chest pain, palpitations,
shortness of breath, tongue biting, dizziness, nausea and
vomiting.  This event happened at approximately 10pm last night
and she initially was taken to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital where by report
a head CT, c-spine films, CXR were negative.  A hip CT was
notable for a fracture of the superior ramus and acetabulum.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of her hip fracture.
 She was initially on the medicine service but was stable and
was transferred to orthopedics for definitive operative
management.

Pre-operatively she was briefly hypotensive in the setting of
narcotics for pain, and responded well to IVF and 3 units PRBCs.
 She underwent right acetabular ORIF on [**2140-6-19**] and [**2140-6-22**].
Post-operatively, her course was complicated by UTI s/p cipro,
and CHF.  She required a left CVL for access which was
subsequently removed and was replaced by a left sided PICC line.
On [**2140-6-25**] the patient desaturated to 75% on a 40% facemask and
was transferred to the MICU for management.  A CTA was negative
for PE but showed multifocal opacities and pleural effusions,
L>R.  She was started on vanco/zosyn for ?aspiration PNA, was
placed on BIPAP, and was diuresed ~3.4 liters with good response
and quick clearing of CXR.  She was called out of the MICU on
[**2140-6-26**] to the medical service.

EKG: sinus rhythm at 99 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals,
Q-waves III and aVF (old), 1mm ST-dep with TWI V5-V6 (appear to
be old), 0.5mm ST-dep with TWI I and aVL (old)

Right hip films [**6-14**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Acute fracture of the right superior pubic ramus and
acetabulum with migration of the right femoral head medial to
the iliopectineal line.
2) Old fractures of both inferior pubic rami.
Please refer to CT performed at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital the same day
for further information regarding this patient's complex pelvic
fractures.

Chest/abd/pel CT [**6-24**]
IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Right pelvic hematoma secondary to comminuted fracture of the
right acetabulum. The femoral head, and neck appear intact.
3) Old healed fractures of the left and right ischia. Fractures
of multiple different stages of healing are sometimes connected
with abuse.
4) 3.8 x 3.2 cm cystic, septated mass within the left adnexum.
Given the patient's age, pelvic ultrasound is recommended for
further characterization.
5) Thyroid goiter.
6) Densely calcified aorta and branches, with focal aneurysmal
dilatation to 3 cm at L3.
7) Multiple foci of decreased enhancement, and density within
the liver, and bilateral kidneys, which are inadequately
characterized on this simple-phase study, but most likely
represent simple cyst.

NAIS [**6-27**]
IMPRESSION: On the right, there is significant superficial
femoral and likely tibial artery occlusive disease. On the left,
there is moderate to significant tibial artery occlusive
disease.

ECHO [**6-27**]
Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric.
7.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR [**7-4**]
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in the magnitude of left
pleural effusion and partial left lower lobe atelectasis.
Residual left pleural effusion and some residual partial
atelectasis of the left lower lobe are still present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Right acetabular and superior pelvic ramus fracture
Patient had a right comminuted acetabular fracture and an acute
right superior ramus fracture, and was transferred from [**Hospital1 1474**]
for definitive management. The patient was initially kept on
bedrest with bucks traction.  She had lovanox for DVT
prophylaxis.  She was started on Ca/vitamin D/fosamax for
osteoporosis.  On [**2140-6-20**] she was taken to the OR and underwent
an ORIF of her posterior acetabular fx.  However, she had repeat
judet views done which showed that the front acetabulum was
still displaced and she was taken back to the OR on [**2140-6-22**] for
ORIF of anteroir acetabular fracture. Post operatively she began
working with physical therapy and was able to get oob with
assist.  Per orthopedics, she will remain in touchdown weight
bearing status x 8 weeks. She will receive lovanox x 4 weeks.
The sutures will be remo
