Microbiology:

Imaging:
[**12-23**] CXR: Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest is
reviewed, and compared to previous study at 1:09 a.m. The right
subclavian IV catheter terminates in the right atrium. No
pneumothorax is identified. The lung volume is small with
continued slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. The heart
is normal in size. Again, note is made of tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta. IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax.
.
[**12-23**] KUB: No evidence for small-bowel obstruction. Limited
study, which cannot rule out the presence of free air. If of
clinical concern, would repeat examination.
.
[**12-23**] CT Abdomen: 1. Distended gallbladder likely containing
gallstones or sludge without evidence for cholecystitis. 2. No
evidence for intra-abdominal or intrapelvic bowel abnormality
including colitis or diverticulitis. 3. Diverticulosis without
evidence for diverticulitis.
4. Low-density lesions within the liver and bilateral kidneys
likely representing cysts. These foci could be definitively
characterized with ultrasound if clinically indicated.
.
[**12-23**] EGK: Atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular response,
rate approximately 115. Inferior myocardial infarction.
Non-diagnostic T wave flattening in the lateral leads. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2121-3-24**] cardiac now atrial
fibrillation.
[**12-25**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation Old inferior infarct Low QRS
voltages in precordial leads Since last ECG, ventricular
response slower
.
CXR [**12-25**]: The exam is unchanged. Lung volumes are small. Right
subclavian IV catheter tip overlies the SVC. Pneumothoraces
present. Patchy atelectasis unchanged, no infiltrates. Heart
size and mediastinal contour within normal.
.
Renal Ultrasound [**12-29**]: The left kidney measures 13.7 cm. The
right kidney measures 14.7 cm. There is no evidence of
perinephric fluid or abscess. In the right kidney there are four
cysts identified, as seen on prior CT exam from [**2122-12-23**]. The
simple cysts range in size from approximately 4 cm to 7 cm in
diameter. In the left kidney there are multiple subcentimeter
simple cysts along with a large 3.5 x 3.7 x 4.2 cm simple cyst
seen in the mid to lower pole. The bladder is full and
unremarkable
