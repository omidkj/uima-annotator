abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female w hx of severe AS s/p
valvuloplasty [**3-/2131**], subsequent CVA, s/p CABG, hx systolic and
diastolic CHF, hypothyroidism transferred from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] ED
for surgical evaluation for possible appendicitis. She presented
with 1 week of worsening belly pain and temp 100.3 taken by VNA.
No n/v/d. Was given cipro, flagyl and 4 L of fluid which
resulted in flash pulmonary edema (hx of MI). She was placed on
Bipap and given lasix unknown dose. CT abdomen notable for
pan-colitis with fluid filled appendix wo stranding - guaiac
neg, nl lactate, well appearing. Surgery eval at [**Last Name (LF) 620**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
need OR for appy, not clear - would like transfer to [**Location (un) 86**] for
ACS eval due to operative risk. Recieved IV abx. Vitals on
arrival to [**Location (un) 620**]: T 99.5, 101/48, 67, 16, 97/RA.
Her GI history is notable for a colonoscopy that was done in
[**2126**], which showed two polyps, one was removed completely, but
one was flat and behind a fold. Pathology turned out to be an
adenoma. She required 2 blood transfusions on [**5-30**] at [**Hospital1 **] Hospital in [**Location (un) 620**] and has been on iron
supplementation. She was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] from GI and she
declined colonoscopy to w/u malignancy at this time.

ED Course: Surgery consulted. They weaned her O2 from bipap to
NC. Noted to be in afib. She put out 300cc foley to 40mg IV
lasix administered at [**Location (un) **]. Not given add'l lasix.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2131-7-31**] 4:05 AM

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-30**], there is
continued enlargement
of the cardiac silhouette. The degree of pulmonary congestion
appears to have
improved. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume
loss in the
lower lobe and some blunting of the costophrenic angle suggests
pleural
effusion. Intact midline sternal wires are seen and there are
multiple
surgical clips in the right axillary region in this patient who
has undergone
a previous mastectomy.

CHEST (PA & LAT)	Study Date of [**2131-7-30**] 10:21 PM

Minimal pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions are
present.
Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. No pneumothorax. Sternal wires
reflect
previous sternotomy, and vascular clips previous right axillary
and chest wall surgery, presumably related to breast cancer.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with hx notable for CABG, AF,
severe AS s/p valvuloplasty in [**3-/2131**], systolic and diastolic
CHF, and [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH for management of 1 week abd
pain and colonic edema, found to have pancolitis on CT, admitted
to MICU for acute on chronic systolic and diastolic CHF
exacerbation.

# Pancolitis
Patient presented initially with significant abdominal pain,
found to have colonic edema and fluid filled appendix with fat
stranding on CT scan at [**Hospital **] transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical
evaluation for concern for appendicitis because high risk
surgical candidate.  Evaluated by surgery at [**Hospital1 18**] who felt that
pt did not have appendicitis and no surgery necessary.  CT
findings presumably infectious, so she was started on
cipro and flagyl, and symptoms improved within 24 hrs.  Lactate
normal.  Differential also included mesenteric ischemia, which
was felt to be unlikely, or translocation with underlying
malignancy. Colonoscopy was felt to be too invasive for her
goals of care at a recent GI appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**].    Cipro
was changed to cefpodoxime prior to transfer to floor to
decrease risk of C diff.  Cefpodoxime and Metronidazole should
be continued for 7 more days for total course of 10 days
antibiotics.  Pt should follow up with PCP next week and with
gastroenterology as necessary.

# Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic CHF
Pt with hx of severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty [**3-/2131**],
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**].  EF improved from 25-30 to 50% s/p
valvuloplasty. On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was admitted to
MICU for hypoxia, likely secondary to fluid overload in setting
of receiving 4.5L of IVFs at OSH ED. CXR confirmed pulmonary
edema with pleural effusions, improved after bolus IV furosemide
in the MICU.  Patient's home dose of furosemide was 40mg daily.
Diuretics were held for two days on transfer to floor in setting
of mild orthostasis.  Patient felt no symptoms of orthos
