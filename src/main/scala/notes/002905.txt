Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
right lower leg cellulitis, CO2 retaining

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2115-6-29**] Right below knee guillotine amputation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 55M with COPD/CO2 retainer, VTE,  bilateral chronic
lymphedema and multiple ulcers who was admited for LE
cellulitis/sepsis and who underwent [**Month/Day/Year 6024**] three days ago is
transfered to MICU for medical management.

He has a history of LE ulcers that have been treated with skin
grafts by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3649**] at [**Hospital6 **]. Over the last two
weeks he developed worsening erythema, swelling, and pain in his
right lower extremity.  He initially presented with these
symptoms at OSH and then transfered to [**Hospital1 **] after developing
hypotension.  He was initially treated with IVF followed by
phenylephrine (discontinued this morning, [**2115-7-1**]), vancomycin,
cefepime and flagyl for cellulitis of his RLE and sepsis. On
intial presentation he was also noted to have hyperkalemia of
5.9, treated with 30mg PO kayexelate and supratherapeutic INR
(on outpatient warfarin) treated with 2 units FFP and
subcutaneous vit K.

Three days ago he underwent right [**Month/Day/Year 6024**] and tolerated the
procedure well. Given his body habitous his stomp was closed by
secondary infection with wound vac. He was extubated this
morning and his respiratory status is at baseline. He is still
sleepy and history was obtained from chart.

On transfer his vs were: T 99 P 98 BP 92/49 R18 O2 sat 90%.

TTE ([**7-2**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
probably normal (LVEF~55%). Right ventricular free wall motion
is probably well visualized although not well visualized. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly to moderately thickened with probably no significant
aortic stenosis (aortic velocity measurements were technically
limited). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is at
least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CXR ([**7-2**]):  In comparison with the study of [**6-30**], there is
substantial increased engorgement of pulmonary vessels
consistent with overhydration. Enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette persists and there are atelectasis or even
consolidative changes at the bases

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented on [**2115-6-29**] in sepsis due to severe right
foot cellulitis and gangrene.  He was coagulopathic with an INR
of 11.  He was actively reversed with FFP and vitamin K and
started on broad spectrum antibiotics.  He was taken emergently
to the operating room for a right foot guillotine amputation to
control his infectious source.  He was transferred to the CVICU
for post-operative monitoring and resuscitation.  His WBC
normalized on POD1 and he was able to be weaned off of pressors
and extubated.  Due to his body size and poor pulmonary
function, it was decided that the best approach to his stump
would be to place a wound vac to faciliate closure rather than
risk general anesthesia for a second time.  On POD2 he did have
quite a bit of bloody oozing from his stump that required the
placement of [**2-24**] sutures to control bleeding.  The vac was
applied later that day to ensure that the bleeding had stopped.
Due to he many medical comorbidities he was transferred to the
care of the MICU team.  The vac lost suction overnight due to
increased bloody drainage.  The stump was then monitored
overnight and the bleeding stopped.  He is now ready for
discharge with wound vac placement to occur when he gets to
rehab.

Assessment and Plan:
This is a 55M with COPD/CO2 retainer, VTE,  bilateral chronic
lymphedema and multiple ulcers who was admited for LE
cellulitis/sepsis and who underwent [**Month/Day (1) 6024**] three days ago is
transfered to MICU for medical management

# Cellulitis c/b sepsis s/p [**Month/Day (1) 6024**]: Improving hemodynamics and
leukocytosis resolved. Continuing ABX (vanc and cefephime, both
started on [**2115-6-29**]). Hypotension improved with IVF and now s/p
phenylephrine over several hours. Blood and urine cx negative.
Treated with Cefepime and Vancomycin with planned duration of 14
days.

# Hypotension: Component of sepsis and surgical blood loss.
Stable MAP after discontinuation of phenylephrine.  Resolved
rapidly and was normotensive for 48 hours prior to discharge.

# Coagulopathy: intially thought to be related to warfarin use.
Imrpoved with FFP and vit K, pre procedure but now PTT and INR
rising again. One concernign possibility is DIC. Dilutional
effects are possible but only 2 pRBC and 9 PLT. Alternatively
acquired inhibitor. AST/ALT within normal limits and bili fine,
but low albumin so synthetic funtion impairment. Finally on
heparin QS tid.  No evidence of DIC.  Decreased heparin dosing
and trended INR.  Once INR returned to 2.6, warfarin was
restarted.

# Hypercarbia/Hypoxia with underlying COPD: h/o CO2 retainer.
Post extubation [**Last Name (un) **] with stable Co2. Goal O2 sat high 80s to
mantain respiratory drive. Continued CPAP at night and O2 via
nasal cannula during the day with usual requirement of 1-3L/min.

# Sleepiness: Possibilities include recent use of propofol
during intubation and obesity. Also COPD with h/o CO2 retain.
