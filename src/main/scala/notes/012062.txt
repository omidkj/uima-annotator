History of Present Illness:
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 32729**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with COPD, restrictive
lung disease [**3-2**] kyphoscoliosis, OSA, and diastolic CHF,
(EF>55%), who presents with complaints of diarrhea X 2 weeks and
an area of erythema on the LLE with a central area of drainage.
On admission, she was also in acute renal failure (Cr 1.7 up
from baseline of 1.1).She stated that roughly 2 weeks ago she
began to have multiple (4-5 times a day) loose watery brown
bowel movements, and on multiple occasions was incontinent of
stool.  She denies nausea and vomiting, sick contact, recent
travel, or ingestion or any unusual foods. On [**6-4**], the patient
was treated for an infected sebaceous cyst of the left abdomen
with ?zosyn.  About one week prior to admission, the patient
noted a 1 cm wound with clear drainage on the LLE.  She did not
seek medical attendtion regarding this lesion.  On the day prior
to admission, the area around the wound had become erythematous
and tender, the wound had developed an eschar and drainage had
stopped.
.
At baseline, she is a Co2 retainer with PaCo2 between 50-60, and
baseline bicarb chronically between 35 and 40.  She chronically
lives with O2 sat at 88%.  She also chronically complains of
being SOB.
.
In the ED, blood cultures (NG), CBC, and lytes were drawn
(Creatinine=1.7, baseline 1.1), CXR performed (bibasilar
atelectasis.  Bilateral, small pleural effusions), ECG with no
ischemic changes, Vancomycin 1 gm IV was given, Flagyl 500 mg PO
was given, and Tib/Fib film showed no involvement of bone.
.
On ROS: she denied CP, SOB worse than baseline, dysuria, melena,
BRBPR.

STUDIES:

[**2114-8-5**]
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS:
CHEST:  There is a small left effusion and moderate right
pleural effusion
with associated atelectasis.  There is no pericardial effusion.

ABDOMEN:  The liver demonstrates diffusely decreased
attenuation, compatible with fatty infiltration.  Within
segments II and III of the liver, there is a more focal
hypodensity which measures 2.8 x 1.6 cm. There is an additional
more suble focal hypodensity in segment III of the liver which
measures 8 mm in size. Neither hypodensity was appreciated on
the patient's previous study of [**2111**]. Multiple gallstones are
present.  The spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys appear grossly
unremarkable.  There has been interval increase in size of a
cystic lesion in the uncinate process.  The aorta is tortuous,
with circumferential atheromatous calcification extending into
the iliac arteries. There is a saccular aneurysm at the level of
the diaphragmatic hiatus which measures 3.6 cm in diameter.
There is no free fluid, free air or lymph node enlargement.
PELVIS:  There is diverticulosis of the sigmoid and descending
colon, without evidence of diverticulitis.  The urinary bladder
is partially distended.  An uncomplicated small bowel containing
right inguinal hernia is noted. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is
moderate scoliosis with associated degenerative changes.  There
are scattered sclerotic foci in both iliac bones and within the
approximate T9 vertebral body and left T11 pedicle, all of which
are stable ([**2111**]) and suggestive of bone islands.
IMPRESSIONS: 1.  Increasing cystic lesion in the uncinate
process of the pancreas, for which an MRI is recommended to
further characterize.
2.  Hepatic hypodensities, as detailed above, which may
represent focal fatty infiltration of the liver versus discrete
hepatic lesions.  These could also be further evaluated on MRI.
3.  Cholelithiasis. 4.  Diverticulosis, without additional
findings of diverticulitis.
5.  Uncomplicated small bowel containing right inguinal hernia.

6.  Bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**8-13**] TTE
The left atrium and right atrium are moderately dilated. There
is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The  aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not  present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears  structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no systolic
anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are  mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There is no pericardial
effusion.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2114-3-27**], the rhythm now  appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Biventricular systolic function and the  severity of tricuspid
regurgitation and pulmonary artrery systolic pressure  are
similar. Mitral regurgitation is no longer seen.
.
[**8-26**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 110.
Left anterior hemiblock. Non-specific lateral repolarization
changes. Cannot exclude old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2114-8-22**] the ventricular
response rate to atrial fibrillation is marginally faster.
.
SERIAL CXRs since admission; the CXR studies below highlight
interval change:
[**8-22**] CXR
CHEST 1 VIEW: A right subclavian PICC line is again seen with
its tip
terminating in the upper SVC. Cardiac size, mediastinal and
hilar contours are unchanged. There are unchanged bilateral
effusions right greater than left with associated atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Essentially unchanged radiographic chest showing
moderate pleural effusion on the right and small effusion on the
left with associated atelectasis.
.
[**9-1**] CXR
FINDINGS:  Right-sided PICC is present, extending to the mid
SVC.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged, with
cardiomegaly and calcification seen of the aortic arch.  There
is unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions, and lung also
appear essentially unchanged.
.
[**9-6**] CXR
The right PICC line tip terminates in mid SVC.  The heart size
is markedly
enlarged but unchange
