History of Present Illness:
80 yo m with hx MVR bioprosthetic, AF on coumadin, 1 month hx of
left shoulder and side pain, presents after MRI today noted what
looked like mets cancer at T1, T2, and T3.  He was called by his
physician who asked him to come to ED at [**Hospital1 18**] for specialty
evaluation.  Pt reports being in usoh when he began to have L
upper chest pain with coughing about 4 weeks ago.  2 weeks ago
noticed left shoulder and scapula pain, as well as left
arm/elbow pain.  In context of all of this he had recent surgery
in [**11/2105**] for MVR, and had 30 lbs weight loss and early satiety
since.  He has undergoing several EGDs which have demonstrated a
short duodenal stricture.  This has been dilated x 2 and
biopsied with results c/w peptic stricture; benign w/o
malignancy.  EUS performed end of [**2106-4-23**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26064**] at
[**Hospital1 112**] showed benign stricture.  He also had Abd CT w/o contrast
[**2106-4-1**] which showed narrowing of post-bulbar duodenum
(stricture as above), with cystic lesion at L4.  Because of the
latter, he underwent bone scan [**2106-4-1**] which was negative.  MRI
cervical spine was reportedly performed today in [**Location (un) 1411**] w/o
gadolinium and showed Thoracic lesions above.  However, we do
not have report nor images of this.

Pt denies fevers, abd pain, diarrhea, or night sweats.  No
problems with urination. He reports colonoscopy 4 months ago at
[**Hospital1 882**], which was normal.  We do not have this report.  He
reports yearly prostate exam which has been normal.  No other
localizing complaints.  He did have a past basal cell carcinoma
which was removed 20 years ago and has not been a problem since.

Video Swallow Evaluation [**2106-8-10**]:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with a moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia
as
characterized above with penetration of thin liquids,
nectar-thick liquids, and ground solid. Pt also had trace
aspiration of thin and nectar-thick liquids with one episode of
significant aspiration with large consecutive sips of thin
liquids. Pt had a spontaneous throat clear in response to
penetration which was moderately effective for clearing the
airway, more so with nectar-thick liquids than with thin
liquids.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. PO diet: nectar-thick liquids, pureed solids.
2. PO meds crushed with applesauce.
3. 1:1 supervision to maintain strict aspiration precautions
4. Small sips, ONE sip at a time.
5. TID oral care.
6. Agree with keeping NG tube in place until pt demonstrates
sufficient PO intake.
7. We will f/u later this week to evaluate for further upgrades.



Brief Hospital Course:
In Summary (please see below for more details):
80 yo m with hx MVR bioprosthetic, AF on coumadin, 1 month hx of
left shoulder and side pain, presents after MRI noted what
looked like mets cancer at T1, T2, and T3. Biopsy of the spine
identified multiple myeloma as the cause of the lytic lesions.
His hospital course has included:
- posterior lumbar fusions on [**2106-6-21**]
- Anterior lumbar fusion [**2106-7-20**]
- ileus and gastric outlet obstruction, requiring dilation
- acalculous cholecystitis and infectious pericholecystic fluid
- C difficile diarrhea
- right sided exudative pleural effusion s/p chest tube and
removal
- health care associate pneumonia (treated with
vanc/cefe/flagyl)
- sacral decubitus ulcer
On discharge, his condition has significantly improved. His
active problem list now includes:
- multiple myeloma: untreated, will likely start chemo soon
- nutrition: tolerating pureed and nectar diet, advance as
tolerated
- duodenal stricture: tolerating diet, GI will followup if
having difficulty with PO
- afib: in NSR during hospitalization, holding warfarin given
comorbidities
- sacral decub: needs wound care
- physical therapy
.

Hospital Course:
#) Multiple Myeloma: Pt presented initially with concern for
metastatic disease seen on outside MRI. He was found to have a
pathologic L4 fracture in need of stabilization and his multiple
myeloma was diagnosed via tissue pathology from posterior spine
stabilization on [**2106-6-21**]. Heme/Onc and Rad/Onc were aware of
patient but put further treatment or evaluation for multiple
myeloma on hold until more
