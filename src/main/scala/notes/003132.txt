Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1005**] is a 52yo F with history of leukocytoclastic
vasculitis recently diagnosed and completed steroid taper about
a week ago who presented to her PCP's office complaining of
fatigue, vomiting and subjective fevers for the past 3 days.
She was found to be hypotensive with systolics in the 90s and
hyponatremic and received 2 liters of NS before being referred
to the ER.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 99, 95, 96/46, 16, 100% RA. She was
febrile to 101 and received tylenol.  CXR was negative for
infection, and urinalysis was benign.  She received stress dose
steroids for concern for adrenal insufficiency and ceftriaxone.
Given her continued borderline blood pressures of systolics in
the 80s-90s despite total of 4 liters of NS, she was admitted to
the MICU for further monitoring.
.
In the ICU, she complains of generalized fatigue and malaise for
the past few weeks and nightly fevers at home for the past
couple weeks.  Patient has had decreased PO intake for the past
week in the setting of this fatigue and malaise. She has had
intermittent headaches, occasional blurry vision, frequent
nausea and morning diarrhea.  She had some non-bloody,
non-bilious emesis yesterday and has had persistant pruritis.
She feels her rash has progressively worsened to cover more of
her body surface now.  No sick contacts.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies chest
pain, chest pressure, palpitations. Denies constipation,
dysuria, frequency, or urgency.

STUDIES:
# CXR ([**2191-3-30**]):
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

# ECHO ([**2191-3-31**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Transmitral and
tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus. Left
ventricular systolic function is probably normal, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be excluded. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mildly elevated pulmonary artery systolic
pressures.

# CXR ([**2191-4-1**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. New mild-to-moderate volume overload.
2. Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis, although
infection cannot
be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1005**] is a 52yo F with history of leukocytoclastic
vasculitis presenting with malaise, hypotension, fever, and
hyponatremia.
.
# Hypotension: Appeared dry on admission exam with history
consistent with decreased PO intake and suspected dehydration.
She also likely had insensible losses due to her rash, fevers
and AM loose stools.  Adrenal insufficiency was also a concern
given her history of steroid use and development of fevers,
malaise, hyponatremia and vague abdominal discomfort after
steroid d/c.  However, her cosyntropin stim test was WNL
(although on the low end of normal).  We felt that sepsis was
also a possibility but no clear source or concerning
leukocytosis (at least initially - see below).  She was given
IVF and stress dose steroids for 1 day and improved.
.
# Fever: She reported nightly subjective fevers at home and was
febrile to 101 in the ER on admission.  No leukocytosis or clear
localizing symptoms on exam or by history to suggest infection
on admission.  Initial CXR and urinalysis were reassuring.
Blood cultures on [**2191-3-30**] grew Strep viridans in one set, and
urine culture grew coag negative staph. CXR on [**2191-4-1**] showed
bibasilar opacities and could not exclude pneumonia.  Fever
could also be due to underlying inflammation from her
vasculitis.  Drug fever was also a possibility given that she
started Plaquenil the day PTA but this did not fit the time
course she had suggested.  Later in the admission she developed
leukocytosis but based on clinical improvement and time course
this was felt to be [**1-19**] steroids.  She remained afebrile for the
remainder of her stay.  She was treated with Vancomycin and
Cefepime during her stay and discharged on Levofloxacin 750 mg
PO for three days to complete a 7 day course of antibiotics.

# Acute kidney injury: Her baseline creatinine is 0.6 according
