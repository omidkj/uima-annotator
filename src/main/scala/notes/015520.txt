Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea, Vomiting, Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**First Name3 (LF) **]

History of Present Illness:
53 y.o. Female w/ h.o. bipolar d.o., s/p recent hospitalization
for jaundice and found to have pancreatic mass causing
obstruction, s/p stent placement p/w recurrent nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain. Pt states she noted the onset of nausea,
vomiting as well as new onset of jaundice 1 day PTA. Noted temp
of 100.3 at home. Pt reports also diarrhea and periumbilical
pain this AM to the ED, but on the floor denies diarrhea and
denies pain. She does report tea colored urine since yesterday.

Pt was noted to have jaundice during psych hospitalization
several weeks ago at OSH and had CT abd/pelvis and MR at OSH
notable for ? pancreatic head mass and biliary dilation and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2172-8-25**] for [**Date Range **]. [**Date Range **] showed a chain of
lakes with a beaded pattern in the main pancreatic duct c/w
chronic pancreatitis versus auto immune disease or malignancy.
Pt also found to have distal high grade stricture of the CBD and
dilated intra-hepatic ducts. Sphincterotomy was performed and
cytology samples sent from CBD which showed atypical cells. A
biliary stent was placed in CBD c plans to remove it the
following week. Stent was removed on [**9-3**] and sent for path which
also showed atypical cells. Pt also underwent abdominal CTA
given question of pancreatic head mass which showed "diffuse
hypoenhancement of pancreatic head and neck with upstream
dilation of pancreatic duct. No definite discrete mass
identified; findings may represent focal pancreatitis, however,
an underlying mass cannot be excluded."

[**2172-9-22**]
Liver or Gallbladder U/S
FINDINGS: No previous ultrasound scan is available for
comparison. There is marked dilatation of the common hepatic
duct proximal to the biliary stent, with maximal transverse
diameter of 14 mm. Intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation is also
seen, most prominent in the left hepatic duct. No obvious focal
parenchymal lesion is identified in the liver. The gallbladder
is surgically removed. The body and tail of pancreas are not
fully visualized. No pancreatic duct dilatation is identified at
the head of the pancreas. Patent flow is identified in the
portal vein.
IMPRESSION:
Prominent dilatation of the common hepatic duct and intrahepatic
ducts
proximal to biliary stent. Findings are suggestive of
obstruction of biliary
stent.

[**2172-9-22**] [**Month/Day/Year **] report
[**Month/Day/Year **]: Scout images demonstrate cholecystectomy clips and a
plastic biliary
stent in the right upper quadrant. Subsequent images demonstrate
cannulation of the pancreatic duct with a beaded appearance.
Cannulation of the common bile duct reveals smooth tapering of
the distal CBD and post- obstructive dilatation of the proximal
CBD and intrahepatic bile ducts. A new plastic biliary stent was
placed. Please refer to the operative note for further details.
IMPRESSION:
1. Beaded pancreatic duct, suggestive of chronic pancreatitis.
2. Smooth distal CBD tapering, consistent with pancreatitis.

Portable CXR [**2172-9-22**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2171-11-14**], there has
been the
development of patchy opacification at the left base consistent
with
pneumonia. No vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lung pneumonia.

[**2172-9-23**]
Chest PA and Lateral
HISTORY: Cholangitis. Increasing hypoxia and shortness of
breath.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**9-22**]:

The lung base is elevated at least by a moderate right pleural
effusion.
Although heart size is normal and unchanged, mediastinal and
pulmonary
vasculature is more pronounced and there is new septal
opacification in both lungs. The simplest explanation is volume
or cardiac related pulmonary edema.

[**2172-9-25**] Chest PA and Lateral
FINDINGS:
Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate
increased patchy opacity in the right upper lobe which may
represent infection. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
small, right greater than left pleural effusions with
compressive atelectasis at the right lung base is unchanged. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There has
been placement of a right PICC with the tip at the cavoatrial
junction.

ECHO [**2172-9-24**]
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

CT Chest without contrast [**2172-9-26**]
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are multifocal infiltrate
involving all
major segments of the lungs, but predominantly in the right
upper lobe. The findings are compatible with multifocal
pneumonia. There is a partially consolidation versus collapse at
the base of the right lung. There is no discrete pulmonary
nodule, allowing the obscuration of the underlying infectious
process. There is no pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural
effusions are noted, but no evidence of organized abscess.
The heart is within normal limit in size. There is no
pericardial effusion. A right subclavian central venous catheter
is seen with the tip at the cavoatrial junction. The great
mediastinal vessels are grossly intact, within the limits of
non-contrast study. The tracheobronchial tree is patent to the
subsegmental levels.
Assessment of lymphadenopathy in the thorax is limited. Two
subcentimeter
pericardial lymph nodes are noted,
