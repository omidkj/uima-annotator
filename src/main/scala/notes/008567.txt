Chief Complaint:
Fevers, chills, and dyspnea for one day prior to admission.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tunneled dilaysis catheter placement
persantine MIBI stress test


History of Present Illness:
62 year old man with PMH notable for DM, ESRD, CHF, CAD who
presents with fever at home to 101.8 degrees fahrenheit. Pt
initially developed a fever and rigors at HD on [**1-7**]. He was
asked to come the the ED at that time for further evaluation but
declined. In further history, pt reports continued fevers once
he returned home. He also experienced dyspnea and chills. He
denies cough or abdominal pain. In further ROS, he denies sick
contacts, cough, rhinorrhea, sputum, lesions/ulcers anywhere,
changes in urinary habits (goes small amt 4-5x/day), changes in
bowel but no BM x 3-4 days.

On presentation to the ED, the pt's VS were 99.6  95  111/47  22
and 85 % on RA improving to 98% on non-rebreather. He received 1
liter of IV fluids, 2g ceftriaxone, 1 g vancomycin, and 160 mg
gentamycin. Pt exerienced some nausea and shaking chills for
which he received anzemet, demerol, and tylenol. Renal was
consulted and recommended pulling the dialysis catheter under
fluoro. Blood cultures (2 bottles) were sent peripherally but
not from dialysis catheter. The patient was admitted to
medicine.

Imaging:

CXR [**1-8**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence for CHF or pneumonia. No pneumothorax.

CXR [**1-11**]
IMPRESSION: Improving congestive heart failure with continued
cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions

Echo [**1-10**]:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Due to
suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
3. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7. No obvious cardiac mass or vegetation seen.
8. Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2118-1-11**],
there has been no
significant change.

Chest CT Angiogram [**1-13**]
IMPRESSION: 1) No pulmonary embolis. Pattern of findings in the
lung parenchyma suggests volume overload. There is bibasilar
atelectasis though pneumonia is not completely excluded.
2) Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes can be secondary to
infectious or inflammatory processes. Lymphoma is within the
differential diagnosis. Follow up examination following
appropriate treatment to assess for resolution.

Persantine MIBI stress test [**1-16**]:
IMPRESSION: Fixed inferior wall and inferior portion of the
lateral wall
perfusion defects. Enlarged left ventricle at rest and stress.
Moderate global
hypokinesis with calculated ejection fraction of 36%. Overall,
no significant
change since the prior exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
## Line infection
The patient was febrile on admission and continued to be febrile
in the MICU with a temperature on [**1-9**] to 102. His hemodialysis
catheter was pulled and the tip was sent for culture. Culture of
the tip and blood cultures grew 4/6 bottles of gram positive
cultures in pairs and clusters which were sensitive to
oxacillin, later determined to be MSSA. The patient was
contained on Vancomycin and gentamycin, and the gentamycin was
discontinued on [**1-10**] after the sensitivities returned.
Surveillance blood cultures since [**1-9**] remained without growth.
The vancomycin was changed to oxacillin on [**1-11**], but this was
changed back to vancomycin due to the ease of renal dosing for
this dialysis patient. He should have a 14 day total course of
vancomycin, and will receive levels and doses at dialysis.

## Respiratory distress - SIRS vs. CHF:
The patient was initially admitted to medicine, but soon after
transfer from the emergency department, the patient developed
respiratory distress with an oxygen saturation of 85% on 5 L NC
improving to 97% on a nonrebreather. He was tachypneic in the
30s. A MICU evaluation was obtained. ABG showed a blood gas of
7.39/48/85.The patient was then transferred to the MICU given a
concern for SIRS response to line infection bacteremia versus
CHF from fluid overload.  Pt was put on Bipap for his
respiratory distress. A temporary hemodialysis catheter was
placed and pt had hemodialysis on [**1-9**] which was terminated
early secondary to respiratory distress with desats to 81% and
rigors. He was put on non-rebreather @10L wi
