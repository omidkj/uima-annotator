Service:  MICU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with history of Down's
syndrome sent to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
a temperature of 100.3, dark-cloudy urine, and lethargy.  In
the ambulance, the patient had some apnea which resolved
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for aspiration pneumonia
complicated by sepsis.

In the Emergency Room the patient was started on ceftriaxone
and Flagyl and sent to the floor.  On the floor, the patient
became hypotensive to a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.
The urinalysis was positive and the chest x-ray was equivocal
saline on the floor, and was started on Neo-Synephrine drip.

Soon after transfer to the MICU, the blood pressure improved.
The pressures greater than 120/70.

1. Down's syndrome.
2. Hypothyroidism.
3. Adrenal insufficiency secondary to use of Megace.
4. Aspiration pneumonia.
5. PEG on [**2102-8-9**].
6. Status post pacemaker for complete heart block.
7. Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastric ulcer.
8. Peripheral vascular disease.
9. Atlantoaxial subluxation.

ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1. SubQ heparin.
2. Albuterol and Atrovent nebs prn.
3. Clindamycin IV.
4. Levofloxacin IV.
5. Neo-Synephrine.
6. GGT.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
Nursing home resident.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION (ON ADMISSION TO THE MICU):
Temperature equals 100.0.  Pulse equals 67-89.  Respiratory
rate equals 14-23.  Blood pressure equals 89-136/70-93.  O2
sat equals 98-99%.  General appearance:  The patient is awake
and alert in no acute distress.  Patient is not cooperative
on examination.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Eyes
examination not tolerated.  Oropharynx clear.  No jugular
venous distention.  No lymphadenopathy.  Supple neck.  Lungs:
Coarse rhonchi diffusely.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate,
and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs appreciated.  Back:  No
costovertebral angle tenderness.  Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel
sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.  G tube in place.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Pulses
palpable distally.  Neurologic:  The patient is responsive
and moves all four extremities spontaneously.

LABORATORY DATA:
White blood cells 7.9, hematocrit 34.0, platelets 392,000.
Sodium is 145, potassium 4.2, chloride 107, bicarb 34, BUN
25, creatinine 0.9, glucose 107.  Urinalysis:  Hazy, positive
nitrates, greater than 50 white blood cells, many bacteria.

Chest x-ray questionable right base opacity, appearing to be
present on previous studies.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is a 63-year-old male presenting from nursing
home with a urinary tract infection.  Became hypotensive on
the medical floor and was then transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit for further care.  Patient became septic on the
floor and in addition was markedly dehydrated.  Patient
received 5 liters of normal saline while on the floor and
antibiotics with marked improvement in blood pressure.  In
the past the patient had secondary adrenal insufficiency due
to use of Megace, which has been discontinued several months
ago.

The patient may have had an aspiration pneumonia secondary to
mental status changes caused by his urinary tract infection.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's urinary tract
infection was treated with ceftriaxone with the possibility
of aspiration pneumonia.  Patient was started on Flagyl.  In
addition Vancomycin was started because the patient had
multiple cultures in the past that were resistant to
antibiotics including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.

Patient remained afebrile during hospital course as well as
normal white blood cell count.  When initially in the
Intensive Care Unit, the patient's pressor was changed from
Neo-Synephrine to Levophed.  Levophed was eventually weaned
to off, and patient was hemodynamically stable with normal
saline fluid boluses prn.  Patient eventually no longer
required any fluid boluses to maintain systolic blood
pressures in the 100s.  While in the Intensive Care Unit, the
patient's secretion management improved as well with the
suctioning required every 1-2 hours with improvement to
suctioning of every 3-4 hours.

On [**2102-12-21**], the patient's antibiotics were changed.
Levofloxacin was added and ceftriaxone was discontinued for
the purposes of covering Pseudomonas which grew out in sputum
cultures.  On [**2102-12-22**], a cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test
was performed.  The results are pending.  The patient had a
random cortisol baseline of 12.

On [**2102-12-22**], the patient was transferred to the medical floor
in hemodynamically stable condition.  Vancomycin was
discontinued and the patient was maintained on po
levofloxacin as well as po Flagyl.

After stable condition on medical floor, the patient will be
transferred back to his nursing home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:
Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Urinary tract infection.
2. Pneumonia versus tracheobronchitis.
