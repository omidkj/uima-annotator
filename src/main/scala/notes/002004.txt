CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Worsening hepatorenal failure from outside
hospital.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was initially
admitted to the hepatology service, and then transferred onto
the transplant service on [**2118-5-5**].

The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted with worsening
hepatorenal failure from outside hospital where he was
admitted on [**5-5**] for increasing resistance to diuretics,
ascites, and renal failure. He managed briefly at the outside
hospital and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-5**]. He was
previously admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2118-2-26**] for same
problems, MELD score of 30.

Upon admission paracentesis was done for worsening abdominal
distention. Fluid culture was negative for bacterial or
fungal growth. Urine culture on admission was done and this
was less than 10,000 organisms. CMV IGG was done. This was
negative. Hepatology initially managed this patient. He is
using lactulose.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.5, BP 111/61,
heart rate 82, respiratory rate 18, 100% on room air.
GENERAL: Frankly icteric male appearing his stated age, lying
in bed comfortably. HEENT: Neck supple. CARDIOVASCULAR: S1
and S2 with no MRG. LUNGS: Clear. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender,
distended. Positive distention. EXTREMITIES: 2+ pedal edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs at the outside hospital show AST 209,
ALT 106, T.bili 10.9, direct bili 5.6, sodium 123, potassium
4.9, chloride 92, CO2 19, BUN 63, creatinine 3.4, and glucose
of 126, hemoglobin 11.7, hematocrit 30.8, and platelet count
less than 120. An ultrasound done on [**2118-3-3**]
demonstrated cirrhotic liver with large ascites, sluggish
hepatopedal flow. Transplant service was consulted.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Wellbutrin 150 mg once daily.
2.  Nadolol 20 mg once daily.
3.  Ambien 5 mg q.at bedtime

He is off diuretics.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hepatic cirrhosis, alcohol associated
condition; ceased drinking in [**2117-4-28**]. Shortly
thereafter developed pedal edema and jaundiced throughout the
latter half of [**2116**]. Ascites, encephalopathy, acute renal
failure, GERD, hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has numerous supportive brothers
and sisters throughout the country, a total of 9. He is
divorced, has two children who was not overly involved in
care.

HABITS:  Alcohol abuse in the past, stopped in [**2117-4-28**].
He denies tobacco. No history of IV drug abuse.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Former bus driver. Currently on disability.

Transplant service was consulted and followed along.

On [**2118-5-7**], an offer for liver transplant occurred. He
was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] for orthotopic liver
transplant from standard brain dead donor, piggyback
technique, portal vein to portal vein, with replaced left
hepatic artery to hepatic artery branch patch anastomosis,
bile duct to bile duct. Liver biopsy was done at that time.
Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] assisted. Estimated blood loss was 1
liter. Please see operative report for further details. The
patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the case.
The patient was in stable condition, intubated and
transferred to the surgical intensive care unit for
postoperative management. Postoperatively his LFTs decreased.
He was initially transfused with 2 units of packed red blood
cells and 1 unit of platelets for hematocrit of 24.5, down
from 32.4 and platelet count of 46. His vital signs were
stable. His creatinine trended down slowly over the course of
the hospitalization to 1.8.

Immediately postoperative, hepatic duplex was done. This
demonstrated all vessels in the liver being patent. A
recipient liver donor biopsy demonstrated established
cirrhosis, stage 4 fibrosis. Please see pathology report for
further details.

Nephrology consult was also obtained. Nephrology followed the
patient in the immediate postoperative period, deferring
hemodialysis with improvement of creatinine. He was extubated
on [**5-9**]. [**2117**]. Vital signs were stable.

He received the standard induction immunosuppression of
CellCept 1 gram IV and 500 mg of Solu-Medrol. over the
hospital course he continued on CellCept 1 gram PO b.i.d.
with a Solu-Medrol taper per protocol. His protocol steroid
taper was altered on postoperative day 10 for alteration of
mental status which was initially noted in the surgical
intensive care unit. The patient was confused.

Neurology consult was obtained. He was inattentive. He was
able to follow simple commands but these were sparse.
Sedation was minimized. It was felt the patient had a
metabolic derangement. He underwent an EEG to rule out
seizure activity. No seizure activity was noted. A head CT
was done. This was also negative. No evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage or mass effect was noted. Head MRI was done as
well with and without contrast. This demonstrated mild age
inappropriate prominence of the sulci and ventricles. No
acute infarct was noted. No mass effect or hydrocephalus was
noted. No abnormal enhancement was noted. Altered mental
status was attributed to steroids and his prednisone was
decreased on postoperative day 10 to 15 mg. This was further
decreased to 10 mg on postoperative day 12 with improvement
in the patient's mental status. His speech was more fluent.
He was more attentive and appropriate. Speech therapy consult
was obtained for concerns for altered mental status.

In summary, it was felt that the patient was experiencing a
toxic metabolic insult. He did not have an expressive or
receptive dysphagia. It was expected that the patient's
communication abilities would return to baseline once medical
issues were resolved. Given concerns for multifactorial
confusion secondary to increased creatinine and decreased
sodium, he did undergo a hemodialysis briefly on [**2118-5-10**]. His sodium remained in the 127 range. He underwent
dialysis again on [**2118-5-11**]. His sodium gradually
improved up to 132 with improvement in his creatinine to 1.9
without dialysis.

Due to poor PO intake, a nutrition consult was obtained. TPN
was started. [**Last Name (un) **] consult was obtained for management of
hyperglycemia with improvement in mental status. The
patient's oral intake improved and TPN was stopped. Physical
therapy worked with him initially recommending rehab but with
improvement in mental status. It was felt that the patient
would be safe to be discharged to home or to family member's
home. He was ambulatory in the hallway with supervision.

The patient experienced significant weight gain and pedal
edema. This was treated with IV Lasix with improvement of
edema. He was switched to Lasix 20 mg PO once daily. His
weight dropped down to 100.3 from preoperative weight of
114.1. He had two JP drains. These were removed and sutured
and he experienced large volume output from the medial JP up
to 2 liters per day. The JP drain was removed and the site
sutured without further leaking his incision. A duplex of the
abdomen was done on [**5-10**]. Patent hepatic and portal
vessels were noted.  Bilateral lower extremity non-invasive
studies were done to evaluate edema. This was done on [**5-17**]. There was no evidence of DVT.

On [**5-18**], a post-pyloric bleeding tube was placed for
concerns that the patient would not be able to meet his
caloric intake need. Unfortunately the patient pulled out his
post-pyloric feeding tube during the night. This was not
replaced given improved mental status. The patient was taking
in at least 1800 Kcal the following day. Improved mental
status was attributed to less steroids given.

In summary, the patient has been in stable condition,
ambulatory, tolerating a regular diet, his incision clips
were opened at the top of the incision in his left lateral
side for leaking of serosanguineous drainage. Normal saline
damp to dry dressings were placed on the open areas b.i.d.
His liver function tests improved with an AST of 22, ALT
