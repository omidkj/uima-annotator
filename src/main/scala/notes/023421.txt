Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
orthopnea, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-5-1**]
1. Aortic valve replacement with a size 25-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Regent
mechanical valve.
2. Mitral valve repair with a size 30 GC Future ring.
3. Coronary artery bypass graft times 4 with left internal

History of Present Illness:
47 yo M with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis awaiting kidney
transplant presented to [**Hospital 16843**] hospital with profound
orthopnea. On [**Holiday **] sunday he first began noting DOE and went
to his PCP who prescribed Azithromycin. However his symptoms
continued to worsen and he eventually went to [**Hospital 16843**]
hospital ED for evaluationi.  He denied chest pain,
lightheadedness, palpitations and no weight gain. He also denied
fevers, chills. However his trop was 5 in ED and he had
ST-depression in lateral leads and he was treated for presumed
NSTEMI with asa /metoprolol/statin and heparin gtt. He was also
found to have bilateral lower infiltrates and started on empiric
ceftriaxone/ azithromycin. An echo was performed that showed EF
40-45% and severe AI as well as possible aortic valve
vegetation. He was also transfused 3U pRBCs for Hct 24.

He was transfered to [**Hospital 498**] medical for TEE. At that time he was
started on Vanc/ceftriaxone and heparin was stopped given high
INR.
He underwent a cath that showed boderline low cardiac output and
elevated wedge pressures, mod pulm hypertension. He was found to
have 95% left main stenosis and 90% LAD and 90% circumflex

Cultures from [**Location (un) 16843**] until that point were negative.  TEE
showed 10X10mm vegetation on the non-coronary cusp with severe
AI and hypokinetic RV as well as PFO and left-->right shunt.
There was also mod-severe MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] were changed to
Gentamicin/Vancomycin and Ceftazidime (given LFT bump).
.
He underwent the placement of a dialysis catheter in the left
internal jugular and thereafter received hemodialysis. He was
dialysed daily for several days and was negative 3L per day. He
received EPO with dialysis and Hct was stable.

6 blood cultures (4 at [**Location (un) **] and 2 at [**Hospital1 **]) were NGTD. He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical evaluation.

pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

NECK: Supple with JVP of ~15cm
CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular
line. RR, normal S1, S2. systolic and diastolic murmur
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp

crackles at bases.
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta not
enlarged by palpation. No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: warm well perfused, bilateral toes appear
erythematous at the distal end, no skin breaks, sensitive to
touch and movement, no swelling noted around the toes, darkned
appearance to dorsum of toes bilaterally.  No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Pertinent Results:
[**2142-5-1**] Echo: PREBYPASS: Moderately decreased LV systolic
function: LVEF = 30-35% with global HK. The left atrium is
moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. There
is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve. Severe (4+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm. There
is no pericardial effusion.Coronary sinus is normal.
POSTBYPASS: Improved LV systolic function with LEVF = 40-45%
with paradoxical septal motion consistent with RV pacing. MV
with no significant MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] after ring placed. AV with no
significant AS or AI following 25mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **] mechanical valve. RV
function remains moderately to severely decreased despite
milrinone, epinephrine and adequate ventialtion and oxygenation.
[**2142-4-27**] Head CT: No acute intracranial process. If there is a
high clinical concern for septic emboli, MRI can be considered,
as it would be a more sensitive technique for the detection of
small abscesses.
[**2142-5-16**] CXR: Left pleural effusion is small. Cardiomegaly is
stable. Right PICC remains in place in standard position. There
are multifocal subsegmental left mid and lower atelectases.
There is no evident pneumothorax. Sternal wires are aligned.
