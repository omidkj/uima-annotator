of feeling increased weakness, lethargy, and diarrhea. He had
been in his USOGH until Wednesday when he began to feel very
weak and fatigued. Per his daughter, he was "shaking like a
leaf", temp 101, SOB. In addition, he began to have numerous
episodes of nonbloody, small volume diarrhea (7-8X/day and

He was given Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, and Levaquin. Blood cx
then grew [**3-28**] + GNR (klebsiella) on [**11-11**]. His BP transiently
dipped to 80/40 (baseline BP in low 100's) and increased to
90-100's with IVF. He was then transferred to [**Last Name (un) 27217**] ICU and
Abx changed to Zosyn. CT scan suggestive of cholangitis, and at
that time, given concern for sepsis, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
with plans for urgent ERCP.
.
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, patient feeling much better with no
further F/C, SOB, improved fatigue.

.
CXR: There are no prior films available for comparison. Cardiac
size within normal limits. Tortuosity of the aorta is present.
There is a general coarsening and irregularity of the lung
markings suggesting underlying COPD. Blunting of both
costophrenic angles is present. Increased densities are seen in
the left lower zone, but these could be chronic in nature.
However, pneumonia is not excluded.
.
CT abd/pelvis:
1. No evidence of biliary obstruction.
2. Nodular, cirrhotic appearing liver with ascites, free fluid
within the abdomen and pelvis.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, with atelectasis and
interstitial changes, worse at the left base.
4. 2.8-cm cystic structure in the tail of the pancreas. This may
represent sequela of prior pancreatitis or inflammatory process,
but if the patient has not had any of these processes, cystic
neoplasm such as IPMN could be considered. Followup with MRI
when the patient's condition stabilizes would be helpful.
5. Splenomegaly, with probable heterogeneous perfusion of the
spleen.
.
MRCP: preliminary read by body MR fellow showed "bead on a
string" appearance of biliary tree consistent with primary
sclerosing cholangitis, the lesion in the pancreas appeared to
be a likely pseudocyst with no evidence of current biliary
obstruction or neoplasm. Will need to have official read
followed up.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Bacteremia: Klebsiella pan-[**Last Name (un) 36**] (except amp); changed zosyn to
cipro in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. CXR showed questionable infiltrate, so unclear if
his bacteremia was from a pulmonary or biliary source. Will need
to complete 2 week course of ciprofloxacin.
.
# ?Cholangitis: Patient has a hx of primary sclerosing
cholangitis recently started on ursodiol. This places him at
significantly increased risk of developing an acute bacterial
cholangitis. Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for presumed acute
cholangitis and abd CT at OSH consistent with this diagnosis. Of
note, patient with very minimal abd pain, no jaundice, TBili
within normal. ERCP was attempted but was unsuccessful. Pt. was
then evaluated for possible PTC. A repeat CTabd however showed
no evidence of biliary obstruction or cholangitis, and patient
was asymptomatic so this was cancelled. His ALT/AST remained
slightly elevated, but his bilirubin remained normal and he
tolerated a low fat diet. He was continued on questran and
actigall. He underwent an MRCP then to f/u on his ?PSC, the
preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] of this showed "bead on a string" appearance
consistent with PSC. No evidence of biliary obstruction or
neoplasm. He will need to have the final [**Location (un) 1131**] of this
followed up, however. He was given the number of the liver
clinic here if he wishes to follow up with a hepatologist here.
.
# Diarrhea: Patient has hx of several days of substantial
diarrhea concerning for gastroenteritis. Stool cx negative and C
Diff negative. Improving upon discharge.
.
# LLL infiltrate: Concerning for pneumonia especially given
recent hx of fever and 1 month cough. Legionella urinary Ag neg.
Will complete 2 week course of ciprofloxacin for Klebsiella
bacteremia.
.
# Anemia: Unclear what baseline HCT. Never had a colonoscopy.
Hct remained stable. Follow up hct as outpatient. Consider f/u
colonoscopy as outpatient.
.
# Hx of 45 lbs weight loss in 3 years: Patient with low albumin,
professed poor appetite, unintentional weight loss over past few
years and hx of malignancy.
Pt. taking good po on discharge.
.
# COPD: currently oxygenating well, no home O2 requirement
- PRN albuterol/atrovent nebs
.
PPX: PPI, SQ heparin, hold bowel regimen for diarrhea
.
Code: Full, confirmed with patient and family
.
