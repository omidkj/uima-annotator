Service:  Medicine, [**Hospital1 **] Firm

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old female
with a history of diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation,
obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, morbid obesity, and
chronic low back pain who was admitted with one week of
progressive dyspnea on exertion, a 4-pound weight gain, and
increasing lower extremity edema.

The patient is also complaining of mild chest pressure on the
day of admission, lasting approximately 5 minutes to 10
minutes, intermittent, relieved on its own, without
associated increase in her baseline dyspnea, without
radiation, without diaphoresis, and without nausea or
vomiting.  The patient denies any fevers or chills.  She
denies any abdominal pain, and denies any dysuria.  She
states she has a chronic nonproductive cough times years that
has increased in frequency over the past week.  The patient
denies any sputum production.  The patient reports dyspnea
with minimal activity; such as eating, dressing, etcetera.

The patient was restarted on Lasix and ACE inhibitor
approximately one week prior to admission.  The patient
reports a decreased appetite, but no increase in her sodium
intake.  The patient reports paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and
orthopnea increased from her baseline.  She states she has
been using her [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure machine six
to seven hours per night.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of
greater than 55%.
 2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
 3.  Hypertension.
 4.  Obstructive sleep apnea (on home [**Hospital1 **]-level positive
airway pressure).
 5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 6.  Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine
of 1.8 to 2.2).
 7.  Chronic low back pain.
 8.  Morbid obesity.
 9.  On home oxygen (2 liters per minute).
10.  Guaiac-positive stools with a negative colonoscopy and
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Neurontin 300 mg three times per day.
3.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Flovent 2 puffs twice per day.
5.  Toprol-XL 25 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Zestril.
7.  Coumadin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has an allergy to PENICILLIN (which
causes a rash).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a Jehovah Witness.  The
patient lives with her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] alcohol.  No tobacco.
The patient does not accept blood products.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 6.7, her hematocrit was 35.8, and her
platelets were 187.  Chemistry-7 revealed her sodium was 146,
potassium was 3.9, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 36
(baseline 33 to 38), blood urea nitrogen was 38, creatinine
was 1.9 (baseline 1 to 1.9), and her blood glucose was 108.
Alanine-aminotransferase was 22.  Her aspartate
aminotransferase was 18.  Pulmonary function tests done in
[**2132-4-20**] showed an FVC of 40% of predicted, FEV1 of 44%
or predicted, and FEV1:FVC ratio of 110% of predicted.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was positive for
signs of congestive heart failure.

An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation, poor R wave
progression, and normal axis.  There were no ST-T wave
changes, but there was T wave flattening in leads I and aVL
(which is old).

An echocardiogram in [**2133-1-19**] showed left atrial
enlargement, an ejection fraction of 55%, mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy, mild right ventricular dilation,
mild mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary systolic
hypertension.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION VERSUS RIGHT HEART FAILURE ISSUES:
The patient was noted to be volume overloaded throughout her
hospital stay.  Multiple attempts at diuresis were tried.

Initially, the patient was tried on intravenous Lasix at
varying doses with the assistance of afterload reduction, and
angiotensin receptor blocker, and heart rate control, and a
beta blocker.  The patient showed minimal diuresis to the
intravenous Lasix regimen of 60 mg twice per day.  This was
then changed to a Bumex regimen of one twice per day, also
with minimal diuresis.  The patient always remained with good
urine output.  The patient had some elevation of her
creatinine during this time, and this limited further
diuresis.  The angiotensin receptor blocker was discontinued
as her creatinine continued to increase.  The patient was
also tried on a dopamine drip along with intravenous Lasix.
This provided little additional assistance for her diuresis.
The dopamine was used in an attempt to increase renal
perfusion; however, this was deemed unsuccessful after two
days.

During her last hospitalization, the patient was tried on a
Natrecor drip which also proved to be ineffective and
resulted in hypotension.

The patient was eventually seen by Nephrology who recommended
increasing diuresis despite creatinine elevations.  The
patient was started on Lasix 80 mg intravenously three times
per day which provided good diuresis of approximately 2
liters; however, this resulted in hypotension and mental
status changes.   In addition, due to the mental status
changes, the patient became hypercapnic and had increasing
insomnia and agitation.

The patient was briefly sent to the Coronary Care Unit where
she was treated with [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure as
well as a dopamine drip.  Her blood pressure returned with
the help of dopamine.  The patient's hypercapnia improved
with the use of [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure.

The patient returned to the floor and had intermittent
periods of somnolence in which [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway
pressure was used with good improvement in her mental status.
The patient maintained some level of diuresis with
intravenous Lasix at low doses; diuresing approximately 500
cc to 1500 cc over a three to four day period.

On multiple repeat chest x-rays the patient showed increasing
pulmonary congestion.  It was unclear whether this was
related to her hypoxic and hypercarbic state versus
right-sided and left-sided heart failure.  There was limited
improvement in the patient's lower extremity edema throughout
her hospitalization.  The patient ins-and-outs were strictly
followed.  She was placed on a low-sodium diet and limited to
1.5 liters of fluid per day.

The Congestive Heart Failure Service and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
closely followed the patient while she was in the hospital.
They remainder of her heart failure course will be included
by the covering intern.

2.  OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA/RESTRICTIVE LUNG
DISEASE/OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient's body
habitus caused multiple problems in her pulmonary function;
including bicarbonate retention, likely from her body habitus
causing some restrictive disease.  In addition, her body
habitus has likely resulted, after the long-term, in some
obstructive airway component.  The patient was encouraged to
use [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure nightly; however, her
use varied depending her mood as well as her tolerate of the
machinery.

An eventual Pulmonary consultation was obtained.  They
recommended possible tracheostomy in the future; however, in
the short term recommended the use of bronchodilators as the
patient had shown some response in the past during pulmonary
function tests.  The patient was started on bronchodilators
as well as a brief course of steroids in the form of
prednisone 40 mg per day for a 5-day course.

In addition, at some point, the Interventional Pulmonology
Service will be consulted regarding an ultrasound of the
chest for possible drainage of any total effusions.

The patient's respiratory status had greatly complicated her
diuresis as well as causing significant mental status
variations.  The patient responded well to [**Hospital1 **]-level positive
airway pressure in improving her mental status as well as
improving her diuresis.  The Pulmonary consultation had
recommended the patient wear the [**Hospital1 *
