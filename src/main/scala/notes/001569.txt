Service:  Cardiology

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Atrial flutter

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 81-year-old male with CAD,
status post porcine AVR and MVR, presented with atrial
flutter.  He presented to his outpatient urology appointment
for bladder stones and was found to have a rapid heart rate
in the 150's.  EKG showed borderline complex tachycardia at
150.  He was sent to see his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**].  He
saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] in his place who performed cardiac sinus
massage, and the patient was found to be in atrial flutter.
He denied palpitations.  No chest pain, shortness of breath,
light-headedness, headache, or visual changes.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD with LIMA to LAD in [**2106**].
Catheterization on [**2116-1-6**] showed significant restenosis of
the LAD that was status post PTCA with moderate restenosis of
the circumflex.  Reintervention on the LAD was deferred due
to gross hematuria.  Echocardiogram in 8/00 showed the left
atrium to be moderately dilated.  The LV cavity size was
normal.  Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.  Right
ventricular chamber size and systolic function were normal.
Bioprosthetic aortic and mitral valves were seen.  No aortic
regurgitation.  Mild mitral regurgitation.  Ejection fraction
was 25%.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in 1/00,
asymptomatic.  Treatment with beta blocker has caused sinus
pauses and severe bradycardia in the past.  Adult-onset
diabetes and bladder stones.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg, q day; digoxin 0.125
mg, q.o.d.; glyburide 2.5 mg, q.d.; Isordil 10 mg, t.i.d.;
Lipitor 10 mg, q.d.; Norvasc 5 mg, q.d.; and Zantac 150 mg,
PO, b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  Shellfish

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.9; heart rate 120;
blood pressure 120/70; respiratory rate 18.  In general, he
was in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils were 2 mm and
symmetric.  Extraocular movements were intact.  There was
sustained nystagmus on the right lateral gaze.  There was a
left facial droop.  Neck:  Supple; no lymphadenopathy;
carotids without bruits.  Respiratory:  Crackles one-third
posteriorly bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regularly
irregular; I/VI systolic murmur at the apex.  Abdomen:  Soft;
nontender; nondistended; positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
 No edema; 1+ DP bilaterally.  Neuro:  Alert; conversive.
Strength:  [**6-13**].  Reflexes:  2+ biceps symmetric.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  White count 8.6; hematocrit 42.3;
platelets 229.  PT 25.7; INR 1.3.  Sodium was 131, potassium
was 3.8, chloride was 103, bicarbonate was 25, BUN was 20,
creatinine was 0.9, glucose was 149, calcium was 9.3,
phosphorus was 2.4, and magnesium was 2.1.  Chest X-ray
showed mild upper zone redistribution.  EKG revealed
wide-complex tachycardia at 150 with a left axis and left
bundle branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 81-year-old male with CAD, status post
porcine AVR and MVR, presented with atrial flutter.  Upon
presentation, his heart rate was in the 130's.  He received 5
mg of IV Lopressor, and his heart rate went down to the 80's
and 90's.  He was started on Lopressor 12.5 mg, PO, t.i.d.
for rate control.  He was continued on digoxin at 0.125 mg,
PO, q.o.d.  His digoxin level was 0.3.  He was on this low
dose because apparently he had high levels of digoxin in the
past.  The patient tolerated this rate control well with a
heart rate in the 60's.  The patient was also anticoagulated
with heparin after a discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 986**], his
urologist.  Apparently, in his recent admission in 11/00 when
he had a cardiac catheterization, he had heavy hematuria;
however, this was on heparin.  LAD intervention had been
deferred at that point.  The decision had been made to
medically manage him.  He tolerated the heparin and Coumadin
without any evidence of hematuria.  The patient was also
started on Captopril given his low ejection fraction.

It was anticipated that the patient would be discharged to
home for chemical or electrical cardioversion after a month
of anticoagulation.  However, on telemetry, he was noted to
have two five-beat runs of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia that were asymptomatic.  He was taken to EP
study.  At EP study, the patient was noted to be quite
agitated, requiring anesthesia to intubate the patient and a
brief stay in the CCU.  It was thought that the agitation was
possibly secondary to the Fentanyl that he received for
anesthesia prior to the EP study.  It may have been an
adverse reaction, so the intubation was for airway
protection.  The plans for the EP study were for atrial
flutter ablation as well as possible ICD placement.  However,
given his agitation requiring five people to hold him down,
the atrial flutter ablation was deferred and an ICD was
implanted.  The patient was also started on amiodarone.

On the day of discharge, the patient had been paced out of
atrial flutter.  He is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2450**] as well as the [**Hospital 3941**] Clinic.
