Imaging:
[**2146-5-13**]
- CXR: Left base opacity worrisome for consolidation; given
history
possibly pneumonia. Underlying atelectasis or pleural effusion
not excluded.  Recommend dedicated PA and lateral views for
better evaluation.

- CT head:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Extensive paranasal sinus disease, not significantly changed
compared to the prior exam from [**2145-10-11**].
3. Opacification of multiple left mastoid air cells, not
significantly
changed.

- CT C-spine:
1. No evidence of fracture or malalignment.
2. Mild multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine
including a
posterior disc bulge at C4-5 that causes mild narrowing of the
spinal canal.
3. Aerosolized secretions in the sphenoid sinuses.
4. Opacification of multiple left mastoid air cells has not
significantly
changed compared to [**2145-10-11**].

- CT chest/abd/pelvis w/ contrast:
1. Left lower lobe and lingular pneumonia.
2. Mildly nodular liver, new ascites, and a splenorenal
porto-systemic venous shunt are consistent with cirrhosis and
portal hypertension.
3. Unchanged loss of height of the L4 and L5 vertebral bodies.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo M with h/o CAD, new evidence of cirrhosis and worsening
thrombocytopenia presents s/p fall and found to be hypotensive
likely d/t pneumonia.

# Hypotension.  Mostly likely [**1-5**] dehydration in the setting of
fever from pneumonia, recent diarrhea, with likely poorer po
intake.  He responded to 3L of NS.  C. diff was negative.  Urine
legionella antigen was negative.  His lactate improved over
course of ICU stay.  BP meds were held while in the ICU.  His
blood pressure improved on the medical [**Hospital1 **] and was well
controlled.  BP medications were restarted on discharge.

# Community acquired pneumonia.  Based on clinical history and
radiological findings.  Patient was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin on [**5-13**].  While in the ICU, his O2 requirement
remained stable at 2-3L NC.  His cough was managed
symptomatically with antitussives.  He improved, albeit slowly,
with ceftriaxone and azithromycin (7 days of therapy) - on
discharge he was prescribed cefpodoxime to complete a 10 day
course of antibiotics.

# GPC in blood culture.  [**12-5**] sets, growing coag negative staph.
Most likely from contamination.  Vancomycin was discontinued on
[**5-15**] after return of this speciation.  He did not manifest
symptoms of bacteremia (no recurrent fevers)

# Throbocytopenia.  He has multiple stigmata of portal HTN.  It
is likely that worsening thrombocytopenia is from the
progression of his portal HTN and cirrhosis, although cirrhosis
work up was not completed.  Other possible etiology include
destruction, bone marrow suppression from alcohol use.  His
platelets have been slowly declining over the last 10 years.
However, it remained stable since admission with stable Hct.
Cardiology was curbsided with recommendation to continue with
ASA 81 mg given his CAD with h/o DES.  ASA 81 mg was restarted
on [**5-15**].  Follow up with the liver center arranged (see below).
 There was no overt bleeding during the hospitalization.

# Ascites.  Found on CT of the abd/pelvis.  Most consistent with
cirrhosis and portal HTN.  SBP unlikely given absence of
tenderness on exam.  Given the small amount, no paracentesis was
performed while in the ICU; u/s repeated on the [**Hospital1 **], but only
small amt of periportal ascites seen again, so paracentesis not
pursued.

# Cirrhosis and Portal Hypertension: Seen on imaging for many
years, most likely d/t EtOH use, but deposition disease raised
on one radiology study.  In ICU, pt noted to have spider
angiomata, gynecomastia, thrombocytopenia, elevated INR, and
asterixis, which are all consistent with decompensated liver
disease.  Viral hepatitis serology was sent from the ICU.  Plan
is to have patient seen by the liver service for further work up
of his cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia as well as setting up
outpatient follow up.

# S/P fall.  Most likely mechanical possibly in the setting of
orthostatic hypotension with dehydration.  However, he could
also be deconditioned given his multiple chronic medical issues.
 No arrhtyhmia was noted on telemetry.  He was ruled out for MI
with negative EKG and
