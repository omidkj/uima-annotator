History of Present Illness:
61M well known to the West 1 service.  He has an extensive
surgical history with the most recent operation being an
ileostomy take down and Hartmann's reversal on [**2153-2-16**].  He was
doing well post-operatively.  His wife states that 2 days ago he
"passed out" for 2 minutes at the table.  She states that he
became very "ashen".  The next day he had a temperature to 104
but they did not seek medical attention at that time.  They are
here now (the next day) for evaluation.  Upon questioning, the
patient appeared to sneeze and then have a vasovagal response,
this happened a second time and he became bradycardic and then
had no rhythm on the monitor.  ACLS was initiated and chest
compressions were begun.  He appeared to be coming to so CPR was
stopped and he had a rhythm on the monitor but now he had no
palpable pulse.  He was in PEA arrest.  He receieved 1mg of
atropine and 1mg of epinephrine and then proceeded to develop
V-tach which then converted to sinus tachycardia.  He was then
intubated for airway protection.  A Right IJ central venous
catheter was inserted.  His BP then began to rise and he began
to fight the ventilator.  Sedation was administered in the form
of propofol.  His blood pressure subsequently dropped to a low
of 50 and Levophed was started.  The propofol was stopped but
his BP
still remained low.  He was then taken to the CT for a noncon CT
of his head and torso.  He was then taken to the SICU for close
monitoring.  A full history was unable to be obtained.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 y/o male well known to surgical service who went into PEA
arrest after fever and probable septic shock at home. He was
successfully resuscitated and was transferred to the SICU for
further management.
He was seen in consult by neurology who felt that the patient
was improving and he actually returned to his baseline by the
time of discharge.
Infectious disease was consulted for antibiotic management for
staph bacteremia (MSSA) in patient with history of aortic
bioprosthetic valve. He still has sternal wires in place.
A TTE was performed on [**4-2**] showing  a severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The bioprosthetic aortic valve was noted and the
gradient was normal. Compared with previous studies the
biventricular systolic function is globally worsened. Another
TTE was performed on [**4-13**] showing an improvement but still
depressed systolic function.
Due to his worsening renal function a renal consult was
obtained. His creatinine continued to rise and his highest level
was 9.4 on [**4-12**]. Over the course of the next few days his
[**Location (un) 1131**] was down to 3.2 with daily improvements. His urine
output was always 2 liters or more and it was felt to be ATN
from the time of the PEA arrest. The patient did not require
hemodialysis. His weights continued to fall daily and his edema
resolved with intermittent lasix. He will be followed as an
outpatient by the renal fellow who saw him during this
hospitalization.
After his initial fever in the ER, he never had another fever
throughout the hospitalization. He had initially been placed on
Vanco, Zosyn and Flagyl which was switched to Cefazolin due to
IDs' concern for an osteomyelitis of the sternum.
The sternal wires were removed on [**4-18**] in the OR and a bone
biopsy was taken at that time. Due to these continued concerns,
the patient had a PICC line placed and he will have 6 weeks of
Cefazolin with labs and follow up with the infectious disease
department.
