Blood culture ([**10-24**] x2): negative

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2151-10-25**]):

MRSA screen ([**10-27**]): negative
Urine culture (Final [**2151-10-26**]): NO GROWTH.
Sputum culture ([**10-27**]): <10 PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X
field. PCP immunoflourescent test negative. No AFB on direct or
concentrated smear. No nocardia isolated (prelim).

CXR ([**10-23**]): Stable cardiomegaly with elevated pulmonary venous
pressure, as evidenced by increased interstitial markings.
Followup is recommended post-diuresis. There is a patchy
infiltrate at the left hilum.

CXR ([**10-27**]): Small region of focal opacification in the
infrahilar left lung could be pneumonia, but could also be
atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema is worsened in the interim
accompanied by increasing mediastinal vascular engorgement.
Borderline cardiomegaly is stable since [**3-24**], increased slightly
since [**3-23**]. Pleural effusion if any is minimal. No pneumothorax.

RUE AV fistula U/S ([**10-25**]): Findings compatible with an evolving
hematoma. However, superinfection cannot be completely excluded
by ultrasound.

CT C/A/P ([**10-25**]):
1. Since the prior exam from [**2151-6-25**], there is interval
development of patchy opacity within the lung bases, worrisome
for aspiration/pneumonia.  Small left pleural effusion.
2. Cardiomegaly and diffuse atherosclerotic calcification
involving the aorta and coronary arteries.
3. Bowel wall thickening involving the cecum, which may relate
to cecitis or possibly in an immunocompromised patient,
typhlitis.
4. Low-attenuation fluid collection in the right pelvis adjacent
to the right iliac vein, slightly increased in size from prior
exam and may represent a lymphocele.
5. High-grade compression deformity of the L1 vertebral body,
unchanged from [**2151-3-18**].
6. Multiple mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
retroperitoneum, pelvis and inguinal region.
7. Multiple healing right sided rib fractures.
8. Stable small right adrenal nodule.
9. Pulmonary arterial hypertension.

TTE ([**10-27**]):
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular
systoli
