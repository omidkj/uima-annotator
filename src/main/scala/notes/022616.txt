syncopal episode at rehab center

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
88 yo M with a history of CABG ([**2153**]) and perioperative MI
([**2171**]) brought to ED after syncopal event at rehab. Pt reports

Admission CXR:
AP and lateral views of the chest are obtained. Midline
sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted, likely related
to prior CABG. There has been interval resolution of previously
noted airspace opacity in the right lower lung. There is,
however, persistent blunting of the CP angles, which may reflect
small bilateral pleural effusions. The heart is enlarged. The
mediastinal contour is stable. Calcification noted along the
aortic knob. There is no pneumothorax. The previously noted PICC
line has been removed.

IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiomegaly, small bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Interval resolution of right lower airspace opacity.

Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo M with severe AS, CAD s/p CABG (88) and COPD who presents
with syncopal episode
.
# Respiratory distress: On hospital day 4, after eating supper,
patient became dyspneic with audible wheezing and rhonchi and
crackles throughout bilateral lung fields. Patient was
transferred to the coronary care unit for closer monitoring.
Lasix was given to treat possible pulmonary edema. Chest xray
was concerning for aspiration, and antibiotics were started.
However, patient became progressively more hypercarbic and
developed recurrent ventricular tachycardia, thus suffering
simultaneous cardiac and respiratory arrest.
.
#)Cardiac:
a)CAD: on ASA, plavix, beta blocker.
b)Valves: Aortic stenosis: valve area 0.9-1.2. Also has mitral
regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation. Not a candidate for
valve surgery because of low EF.
c) Pump: history of systolic heart failure with EF 35%.
Continued lasix daily with lasix boluses prn.
d) Rhythm: SR with ventricular ectopy: likely that run of NSVT
or SVT, superimposed on his severe AS, lead to his syncope. On
telemetry here, had frequent ventricular premature complexes,
couplets, triplets, and runs of ventricular tachycardia.
Potassium and magnesium were repleted, beta blockade was
maintained as blood pressure tolerated, and amiodarone was
started. On HD#2, patient had 15 minutes of sustained
ventricular tachycardia, hemodynamically stable, so amiodarone
infusion was begun, with control of the VT. Over the next 24
hours, ventricular ectopy decreased in frequency but did
persist.

Electrophysiology consult advised against EP study, which would
be high risk in a patient with aortic stenosis and would not be
consistent with patient's wishes to be DNR/DNI and avoid
invasive procedures, which the EP consultants discussed with the
[**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy.

On HD#4, immediately after an apparent aspiration event
described above, patient again developed sustained VT and
subsequently expired.
.
#) Hypertension/hyperlipidemia: currently not hypertensive, will
give metoprolol. Hold ACE as pt likely to get more benefit from
BB. Continue statin
.
#) Right heel ulcer: Recent arterial studies showed poor flow in
right lower extremity arteries. Has severe ulceration of right
heel and is getting aggressive wound care at rehab per daughter.
[**Name (NI) 109876**] [**Name2 (NI) **] and wound care as recommended by wound nurse.
.
#) Diabetes: with elevated fasting glucose.
- continued insulin sliding scale.
- diabetic diet
.
#) COPD: continue inhalers
- alb/ipratropium prn
.
#) Aspiration risk: S & S last admission recommended modified
diet of nectar thick liquids with the chin tuck and ground
consistency solids with the knowledge that he may intermittently
aspirate.
.
# FEN: Euvolemic, lytes pending, nutrition with cardiac diet.
# PPX: heparin sc, ppi
# DNR/I (discussed with daughter)
# dispo: pending improvement in symptoms.
# Comm: with health care proxy, his daughter [**Name (NI) 1494**] [**Name (NI) **]
