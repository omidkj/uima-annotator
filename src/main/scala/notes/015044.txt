Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4232**]
Chief Complaint:
Leg pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L 2nd and 3rd toe debridement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 44065**] is a 60 year-old man with a history of chronic lower
extremity venous stasis complicated by chronic cellulitis,
cerebral palsy, atrial flutter s/p recent cardioversion,
presenting with cellulitis. He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
[**10-24**] - [**10-28**] with toe cellulitis. He was treated with
antibiotics and discharge [**10-28**] to [**Hospital3 **] for skilled
wound care. On [**11-6**] he was discharged to home. Since then, he
has had increasing leg erythema, pain, and weeping. He denies
fevers, chills. He also denies palpitations or light-headedness.
He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2392**] [**11-12**] who noted worsening leg appearance, but
the patient refused hospitalization for IV antibiotics. His home
nurse has also been urging him to go to the hospital. Finally,
because the pain was worsening yesterday, he presented to the
ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.6, HR 94, BP 116/88, RR 16, O2
100% RA. The impression was lower extremity cellulitis. He was
given a dose of vancomycin 1g and morphine 6 mg with plans to
admit to medicine. However, overnight he was persistently tachy
to 120s, briefly hypotensive with systolic to the 70s, and did
not receive fluids. In the morning he was given a total of 4 L
NS , and antibiotics were broadened to include
piperacillin-tazobactam. HR fell to 90s-110s (sinus, with ST
depressions thought to be rate-related). Blood pressure rose to
96/60.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient complains of ongoing leg
pain. He denies chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath.
He also denies nausea, vomitting, chills. Review of systems
otherwise negative


Past Medical History:
- Cerebral palsy, wheelchair bound as of ~[**2130**]
- History of PEs (bilateral in [**12/2134**], right subsegmental in
[**8-/2138**]) on anticoagulation
- A-flutter s/p cardioversion [**10-2**], on amiodarone and
anticoagulated
- HTN
- Right heart failure with moderate Pulmonary hypertension, 2+
TR on TTE (but done in the setting of PE [**8-/2138**])
- Hypothyroidism
- h/o recurrent MRSA cellulitis
- Incontinence
- Cervical spondylosis
- Chronic back pain
- Obesity
- Hyperlipidemia
- Chronic venous insufficiency
- Depression
- Open heart surgery at age 12, unknown type of repair (patent
foramen ovale or ventricular septal defect?)
- Hematuria w/ atypical cells [**8-/2138**]


Social History:
He was discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**] after his recent admission
but then discharged to home [**11-6**] with 8 AM to 5 PM home
services. There is considerable concern on the part of his PCP
that he may not have adequate services at home. He had prior
admission for abuse from previous caregiver. [**Name (NI) **] uses an electric
wheel chair to move about. He smomked 1 ppd for 10 years, quit
in [**2128**]. He drinks alcohol occasionally and denies illicit
drugs. He denies having any living family

Family History:
 Mother died at 48 from brain tumor. Sister died at 42 from
breast cancer. No premature CAD of sudden cardiac death

Physical Exam:
On admission:
VS: T 96.5, BP 93/56, HR 113, RR 29, O2 99% 2L
Gen: alert, oriented, conversant
Cardiac: faint systolic murmur, regular, tachycardic
Lungs: clear bilaterally
Abd: soft, nontender, obese
Ext: L arm contracted. Bilateral lower extremity woody
induration below the knee with erythema extending both

bilateral 2+ pitting edema, all warm and exquisitely tender.
Distal pulses palpable. Sensation intact.
.
On discharge:
Legs still with breakdown bilaterally, however, erythema has
resolved. No pustular drainage.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 60 year-old man with a history of chronic venous stasis
complicated by chronic lower extremity cellulitis, cerebral
palsy, atrial flutter, currently admitted for cellulitis.
.
#. Cellulitis: He had impressive lower extremity erythema and
sloughing of skin. Although it is difficult to know what his
legs look like chronically, prior notes document mostly just
woody induration without significant erythema. The sloughing and
necrotic-appearing areas also seem to be new. The only bacteria
that has been isolated previously was MRSA from a wound. Blood
pressures were on the low end of what they have been previously
and he persisted with sinus tachycardia depite many fluid
boluses.  Boluses were continued in the MICU.  He was given
vancomycin and Zosyn, with dramatic improvement in the lower
extremity erythema over the first day.  He was given morphine IV
for pain prior to wound care; oxycontin was started for
long-acting control and oxycodone for breakthrough pain.  Blood
cultures were negative. Wound culture grew MRSA. Zosyn was
discontinued and Vancomycin was continued to complete a 14-day
course. Wound care recommendations were followed and dressings
were changed each day. Legs were kept elevated. The erythema
resolved though on discharge, there was still a moderate degree
of skin breakdown. On the days prior to discharge the posterior
surfaces of his calves developed significant bleeding from wound
beds. His hematocrit remained stable. Vascular was consulted and
they were unable to identify any actively bleeding vessels. His
dressings are to be changed per vascular/wound care
reccomendations.
.
# ? DM: FS 422 on admission with history "borderline" diabetes
(HgA1c 6.3% in 08/[**2138**]). BG may be elevated in the setting of
stress currently.  He was given humalog insulin sliding scale.
Blood sugars improved and SSI was discontinued.
.
#. Atrial Flutter: Pt with history of a-flutter but had
cardioversion done in late [**2138-8-3**] and is on amiodarone.
Currently EKGs all appear to be sinus.  Amiodarone and
anticoagulation were continued. Patient remained in NSR.
.
#. Cerebral palsy: Patient increasingly unable to perform ADLs.
Baclofen was continued.  He  will likely need arrangements for
more home services vs long-term care facility prior to
discharge.
.
#. Hypothyroidism:  TSH was 11.  Levothyroxine 75 mcg daily was
continued.
.
#. History of Pulmonary Embolism:  Anticoagulation was initially
held due to high INR in the setting of antibiotics. Coumadin was
restarted on the floor. On day of discharge his INR was 1.7. He
shoudl have his INR followed closely as an outpatient.
.
# ? CHF: Patient with recent clinical and echo diagnosis of
R-sided CHF, but that was in the setting of acute pulmonary
embolism. There are also mentions in prior notes of diastolic
heart failure, although this is not evidenced on his echos. He
is on a heart failure regimen at home.  Torsemide,
spironolactone, and metoprolol were initially held in the
setting of borderline blood pressures. Metoprolol was restarted
this AM prior to transfer to the floor. Spironolactone was also
restarted.
.
# ST depressions: likely rate-related. Troponin not elevated.
Repeat EKG back to baseline.
