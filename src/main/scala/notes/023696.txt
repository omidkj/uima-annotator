Respiratory Failure

Brochoscopy

History of Present Illness:
36 year-old woman with history of HIV/AIDS (CD4=56) on HAART and
PCP/MAC prophylaxis), metastatic squamous and adenocarcinoma of
the lung (on tarceva) with brain mets and chronic malignant
effusion status post right bronchial stenting [**7-3**], recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after an admission for pneumonia who
presents from an outside hospital for acute onset shortness of
breath.  On arrival to the ED, patient reported worsening
dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain for several days prior to
presenting to the outside hospital, as well as pleuritic left
sided chest pain.  Subsequently, the patient was intubated for
respiratory distress.  History was limited given the patient was
intubated at the time of evaluation, but she denies chills,
headache, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, photophobia, or abdominal
pain.  She reports progressive dyspnea, worse with exertion,
fever to 101, and cough productive of yellow sputum.  She
reports back and neck pain, which is chronic.  She reports
compliance with all of her medications, including her HAART and
bactrim/azithro.  Patient was slightly hypotensive after
intubation and improved when sedation was weaned.
.
During her last admission for pneumonia in [**2192-6-29**], she was
initially treated with Ceftriaxone and Flagyl, and later
transitioned to Augmentin at the time of discharge.  She
underwent thoracentesis, which revealed an exudative effusion
with cells consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Pleural
fluid was culture negative.  There was no lung re-expansion so
pleurex catheter was placed.  She also underwent bronchoscopy
which revealed complete right main bronchus obstruction, so
right bronchial stenting was performed.

Past Medical History:
1. Both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma of the lung and RUL
lobectomy, with metastatic NSCLC with brain mets, status post
stereotactic radiosurgery to a right cerebellar resection cavity
and a right occipital metastasis, followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]; history
of SVC syndrome; she is being treated with Tarceva for
palliative control of tumor burden
2. HIV diagnosed in [**2173**], contracted status post blood
transfusion from birth of son, c/b PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], and thrush. Also
with history of Lymphoma after having axillary LAD. Last CD4 was
67 on [**2192-5-21**]. Switched to new regimen ~1.5 months ago.
3. Total abdominal hysterectomy for uterine cancer in [**2184**]
4. Carotid artery aneurysm on L
5. Emphysema
6. status post Cholecystectomy


Social History:
Prior 30 pack-year smoking history per records.  She drinks
alcohol occasionally. She used marijuana many years ago but
denies any recent illicit drug use. She lives with her husband
and her son.


Family History:
Her father is alive with CAD, mother is alive with CAD and
history of CVA. One of her sisters had ovarian cyst, and one of
her brothers died as an infant from an unknown cause.

CXR: Comparison is made to [**2192-7-20**].  There is persistent
complete opacification of the right hemithorax.  There is a
persistent right lateral indentation on the trachea.  There is
worsening opacity in the left lung with multiple nodules, which
appear slightly larger, although this could be due to adjacent
opacity.  Surgical clips are again noted in the right upper
quadrant.  Left chest tube remains in place. Appearance of the
right main stem bronchus stent is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
36 year-old woman with history of HIV/AIDS (CD4=56) on HAART and
PCP/MAC prophylaxis), metastatic squamous and adenocarcinoma of
the lung (on tarceva) with brain mets and chronic malignant
effusion status post right bronchial stenting [**7-3**], recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after an admission for pneumonia who
presents from outside hospital for acute onset shortness of
breath.  She was intubated in ED for respiratory distress.
.
1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The etiology of her acute respiratory
distress was unclear on admission, but is likely related to a
worsening left sided pneumonia.  Other possibilities for acute
decompensation include pulmonary embolism since she is likely
hypercoagulable or and increase in her tumor burden.  A chest
CTA was not performed due to her iodine allergy.  Upper and
lower extremity ultrasounds were significant for non-occlusive
clots in axillary and subclavian veins bilaterally.  Therefore,
the possibility of a pulmonary embolism could not be excluded;
however, she was not started on heparin empirically due to the
presence of brain metastasis.  She was started on empiric
antibiotics (vancomycin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone,
metronidazole, and Bactrim) for community acquired pneumonia,
atypical pneumonia, and PCP.  [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] bronchoscopy showed a patent
proximal stent in the right mainstem bronchus with tumor
overgrowth as well as diffuse mucosal edema on the left with
thin watery discharged.  The bronchial lavage was negative for
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Bactrim was stopped.  On hospital day 2, she began to
have continued increased oxygen requirement and a chest x-ray
showed increased left lower lobe opacity.  Upon talking to the
husband and family, it was decided to see if her respiratory
status improved with the antibiotics.  Her respiratory status
continued to decline as she became more hypoxic and more
hypercarbic requiring increased ventilator adjustments.  On
hospital day 4, the husband and family decided to withdraw
ventilator support and the patient expired.

2) HYPOTENSION: She had transient hypotension after intubation
that was likely secondary to sedation.  However, her clinical
picture was concerning for sepsis given her respiratory failure,
reported fever, and tachycardia.  Her lactate was mildly
elevated, but that may be from her HAART medications.  Her mean
arterial blood pressure was maintained above 60 with fluid
boluses.

3) HIV/AIDS: Her last CD4 was 56.  She was maintained on her
HAART medications throughout the admission.

4) SQUAMOUS/ADENOCARCINOMA OF LUNG: She has metastasis to her
brain and is status post stereotactic radiotherapy.  She had
been recently treated with Tarceva.  She had tumor occluding her
right mainstem bronchus causing collapse of her right lung that
was stented during her recent admission.  She was seen by her
oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**], on this admission who feels that no
further treatment is warranted given the progression of her
disease.  Interventional Pulmonary also saw her and felt that
there was no indication for further intervention.

5) CHRONIC PAIN: She was maintained on fentanyl and propofol
drip for pain control.

6) ANEMIA: During her last admission, her baseline hematocrit
was between 24-27.  Iron studies last admissi
