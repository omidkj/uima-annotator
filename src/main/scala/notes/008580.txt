Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2168-11-1**]
Prebypass

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apical and mid portions of
the inferior and inferoseptal walls. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results on [**2168-11-1**] at 845am

Post bypass

Patient is A paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. Bioprosthetic
valve seen in the aortic position. It appears well seated and
the leaflets move normally. Trivial central aortic insufficiency
present. Aorta is intact post decannulation.

CHEST RADIOGRAPH [**2168-11-5**]

INDICATION: Vascular repair.

COMPARISON: [**2168-11-2**].

FINDINGS: The sternal wires and metallic parts of the valve are
in unchanged,
normal position.

Moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged as compared to the previous
examination.

The pre-existing retrocardiac and left basal atelectasis has
improved.
Overall, the ventilation of the lung parenchyma is improved.

Minimal right basal atelectasis, minimal right pleural fluid
that extends into
the major fissure. No focal parenchymal opacities suggesting
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 40558**] is a 64-year-old male with worsening symptoms related
to critical aortic stenosis, with known coronary artery disease,
status post percutaneous interventions with occluded right
coronary artery. On [**2168-11-1**] mr. [**Known lastname 40558**] was taken tot he
operating room where he underwent an aortic valve replacement
(25mm Tissue value).
post operatively he was transferred to the ICU intubated and
sedated. He awoke neurologically intact and was weaned from the
ventilator and extubated. His betablocker and statin therapy was
resumed and was started on laisx and diuresed toward his
pre-operative weight. Lisinopril was added for hypertension. He
was transferred from the ICU to the step down unit. His chest
tubes and temporary pacing wires were removed per protocol. He
was evaluated by physical therapy for strength and conditioning
and was cleared for discharge to home. On POD# 5 Mr. [**Known lastname 40558**] was
cleared for discharge to home by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with VNA services
an all appointments were advised.
