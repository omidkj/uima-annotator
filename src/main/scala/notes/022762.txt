Chief Complaint:
Increasing fatigue and dyspnea on exertion


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2161-4-28**] Aortic Valve Replacement with 21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Tissue Valve
and Replacement of Ascending Aorta utilizing a 34mm Hemashield

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 year old female hospitalized [**2160-12-27**] with
strep bacteremia. UTI or PNA was thought to be the offending
source and she completed two week course of Levaquin. Had
ventricular ectopy which prompted an echocardiogram which
revealed severe AI, a dilated ascending aorta and severe
cardiomyopathy. A cardiac catheterization did not show any
significant coronary disease. She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
[**Month (only) 958**] at [**Hospital6 3872**]. After extensive preoperative
evaluation, she was eventually cleared for cardiac surgical
intervention.

Pertinent Results:
[**2161-4-28**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25
%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is moderately
dilated.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to increased
stroke volume due to aortic regurgitation. Moderate to severe
(3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The jet is
central. The mitral annulus is enlarged and measures 3.9 cm.

POST-CPB: On infusion of epi, milrinone, phenylephrine. AV
pacing for SB and poor atrial capture. Well-seated bioprosthetic
valve in the aortic position. Trivial AI. MR is now 1+.
Biventricular systolic function is improved on inotropic
support. LVEF = 35%. The proximal aortic graft appears in place.
The descending aortic contour is normal post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and was brought to the operating room
for aortic valve replacement and replacement of her ascending
aorta.  See operative report for further details.  Given
Penicillin allergy, she received Vancomycin for perioperative
antibiotics.  She arrived in the intensive care unit on
Milirone, Epinephrine, and Neosynphrine for hemodynamic support.
She was transfused for anemia with packed red blood cells and
hematocrit remained stable post transfusion.  In the first
twenty four hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. Over
several days, she was gradually weaned from inotropic support
and transitioned to heart failure regimen of Coreg, Captopril,
and Lasix for diuresis.  She otherwise maintained stable
hemodynamics and transferred to the floor on postoperative day
five. She remained in a normal sinus rhythm and her renal
function remained stable. Over the remaining days, medical
therapy was optimized. She continued to make clinical
improvements with diuresis and was eventually cleared for
discharge to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 11320**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3549**] in [**Location (un) 1110**].
