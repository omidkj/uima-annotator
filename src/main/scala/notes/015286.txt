Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**]
Chief Complaint:
A fib with RVR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right side thoracoscentesis on [**2144-10-28**]

History of Present Illness:
59yF with h/o mental retardation,  Nodular sclerosing Hodgkins
Lymphoma s/p chemo, refractory paroxysmal a.fib w/RVR, ileus,
pericardial effusion requiring window and pleural effusions, who
p/w Afib w/ RVR after being discharged on [**2144-9-18**] to rehab
following hospitalization for tachypnea and increased O2
requirement.
This past hospitalization was complicated by refractory afib
with RVR requiring amiodarone ggt for conversion, GNR bacteremia
with ecoli, enterobacter, and two species of klebsiella,
recurring ileus necessitating rectal tube decompression, herpes
simplex ulceration of the mouth and hypercarbia and somnolence
requiring intubation.
At Rehab, she was noted to be in afib RVR 140s with HR 120-150,
SBP 100-115/40-50, 20, 97 room air. On readmission, she was
given a bolus of 150mg IV amiodarone given with minimal response
(rate in 120s, SBP 90). Cardiac U/S showed pericardial fluid.
Cardology was consulted, and recommended IVF (given 1300cc) and
beta blockade once pressure had  stablized. She was given Cipro
and fluconazole in the ED, and then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
monitoring and further management of low BP and Afib/RVR.


Past Medical History:
Oncologic history:
She was admitted to [**Hospital6 2561**] on [**2144-6-12**] with SOB. An
echo showed pericardial effusion with no evidence of tamponade.
She was found to have an elevated CRP and negative [**Doctor First Name **] and RF.
She was discharged with recommendations for a short interval
follow up and recomendation for pericardiocentesis.
.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2144-6-22**] for evaluation of
abdomenal distention in the setting of recent dx of pericardial
effusion and iron def anemia. CT on admission showed pericardial
effusion with evidence of tamponade. Pericardiocentesis on
[**2144-6-24**] produced 510mL of serosanguinous fluid with
predominantly lymphocytes, a few mesothelial cells and blood but
no malignant cells. Given these findings a full malignancy
work-up was done. CT torso ([**2144-7-6**]) showed diffuse
lymphadenopathy, diffuse colonic thickening and incresing
abdominal distention which was thought to be functional by both
radiology and GI, and was relieved by rectal tube. FNA biopsy of
a left axillary lymph node on [**2144-6-30**] was non diagnostic. She
was discharged on [**2144-7-7**] with instructions to see her PCP
within [**Name Initial (PRE) **] week for excisional LN biopsy.
.
on [**2144-7-16**] she represented to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital 3678**] Hospital and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with hypoxia, pleural effusion and
pericardial effusion. Excisional LN biopsy of a L
supraclavicular LN showed classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Thoracentesis was attempted, but unsuccessful. Her labs at that
time showed WBC 12.6 with 98% PMN and 2% Ly, Hb 8.3, HCT 28.1,
PLT 472K, ESR 107 and Albumin 3.0. Of note, EF is >55%. CTA
chest was negative for PE but did reveal a mass compressing SVC.
Patient continued to be hypoxic to the 80's on 100% face mask
and had persistent Afib w/RVR to 140s. She was transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] because of increased bedside nursing care needs.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was started on a modified EACoPP protocol on
[**2144-7-21**] with cytoxan, doxorubicin on day 1 and etoposide days
[**2-13**]. Her ICU course was complicated by paroxysmal Afib with RVR.
On [**2144-7-23**] she was started on amiodarone and metoprolol and was
eventually rate and rhythm controlled. On [**2144-7-24**] she became
more somnolent with ABG showing PCO2 of 81. A thoracocentesis
drained 1.6L of fluid which showed "many small lymphocytes and
scattered reactive mesothelial cells." The fluid culture and
Gram stain were sterile. She was intubated for 3 days and
extubated one day prior to transfer to BMT.
- Xfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**7-25**] for AFib with RVR and hypotension
with pulse 160s and SBP to 80s. She was restarted on amio IV and
spontaneously converted to NSR. Her BP stabilized while in
sinus. Her pulsus was recorded as 4 but she did have pulmonary
congestion and distended neck veins. An echo was obtained which
showed RV and RA collapse w tamponade physiology.
- On [**2144-8-24**], cardiac surgery was urgently consulted
following the echo that revealed significant pericardial
effusion and right ventricular collapse. Given those findings,
she was brought to the operating room where Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed
urgent pericardial window. She tolerated the procedure well and
there were no complications. Approximately 150 cc of clear fluid
was removed and sent for cytology. Following the operation she
was brought to the CVICU for monitoring. Within 24 hours, she
was extubated without incident. She was maintained on Amiodarone
and beta blockade for intermittent atrial fibrillation. TPN was
continued for her chronic ileus. Her CVICU course was otherwise
uneventful and she transferred to the SDU on postoperative day
one. She continued to experience atrial fibrillation. Her
mediastinal chest tube was eventually removed on [**2144-8-31**]. She
eventually transferred back to the BMT service on
[**2144-9-2**].
