Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventral hernia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2114-10-29**]:
1. Extensive adhesiolysis, over 4 hours.
2. Small bowel resection, approximately 40 cm.
3. Ventral hernia repair with acellular dermal matrix in an area
of 24 cm x 32 cm with Strattice

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35199**] is a 71M with history of an extensive ICU and
hospital day for necrotizing pancreatitis and abdominal
compartment syndrome with resultant open abdomen.  This was
temporarily resolved at the time with Vicryl mesh placement
followed by skin grafting. He had also undergone multiple
retroperitoneal approaches to pancreatic debridement, having
recovered fully.  Ultimately,
he was doing well except for complete loss of domain and
discomfort and pain associated with that.  Thus, understanding
the risks to this essentially helpful operation, he was brought
to the operating room with a plan for excision of the skin
graft, adhesiolysis, cholecystectomy if feasible, and then
hernia repair by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with component separation and/or mesh
repair.

Past Medical History:

compartment syndrome, necrotizing pancreatitis

[**2114-10-29**]: EKG
Sinus tachycardia. Low voltage. T wave abnormalities. Since the
previous
tracing of [**2114-10-16**] the rate is faster. T wave abnormalities are
more
prominent. Clinical correlation is suggested.

[**2114-11-1**]: CXR
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
change. Bilateral areas of atelectasis. Nasogastric tube in
situ. Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema.
No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35199**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] ventral hernia repair with biologic mesh
after extensive lysis of adhesions and small bowel resection on
[**2114-10-29**]. The operation was completed without complications and
the patient was admitted to the ICU postoperatively for fluid
management from [**2114-10-29**] to [**2114-11-1**] due to length of the
procedure. He was transferred to the floor [**2114-11-1**] and
recovered without complications. His hospital course is
described below by system:

Skin:
Patient's hernia wound was initially dressed with wound vac in
upper and lower defects in skin graft. On POD1, the lower vac
was removed and replaced with wet to dry dressing. Vac was
changed every 3 days by Dr.[**Name (NI) 27488**] team. On POD 3, lower pole of
skin graft appeared to be ischemic. Ischemia progressed until
graft appeared devitalized on POD9. Devitalized skin graft
tissue was debrided and a large wound vac was applied to skin
defect. Wound bed appeared healthy and without drainage for
duration of hospital stay.

GI:
Due to chylous collection found intraop, patient's JP drain was
monitored daily for chyle. Patient was kept NPO post-operatively
and advanced to clear liquids on POD5. Patient was advanced to
fulled on POD7 after pasing flatus. No chyle was observed in
drain. He tolerated a regular diet on POD8.

Pulmonary: The patient was extubated on [**2114-10-30**] (POD1) without
difficulty. He was kept on CPAP at night for his sleep apnea. He
was stable from a pulmonary standpoint throughout his stay.

Heme/ID: Patient was transfused 2U PRBC on POD2 for Hct 21.9
which increased to 29. His Hct remained stable and was 32 on the
day of discharge. Post-operatively, the patient was kept on IV
vancomycin for 3 days. The patient's temperature was closely
watched for signs of infection.

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid PCA with
good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral
intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: The patient continued his metoprolol throughout the post
operative period with no change in status from baseline.

GU/Renal:
Patient's Cr remained at baseline throughout his stay. On the
evening of POD0, patient's urine output was low but responded
appropriately to fluid bolus. Lasix diuresis was started on POD2
and continued until fluid status was even on POD5. Foley was
removed on POD4 and patient voided without difficulty.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

At the time of discharge on POD#10, the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.
