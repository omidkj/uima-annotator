History of Present Illness:
This very nice 49-year-old gentleman was referred for a duodenal
carcinoid that
was recently picked up on an upper endoscopy. He has recently
been worked up for elevated liver function tests and there was a
concern that he might have PFC. An ERCP was performed by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] recently and this revealed a normal biliary duct
without obstruction. Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**] has been working up his
liver function which showed mild fibrosis on a percutaneous
biopsy. On Dr.[**Name (NI) 62661**] ERCP, a 1 cm peri-ampullary duodenal
lesion was identified and biopsied and this came back as a
carcinoid tumor. Therefore, he was sent
to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for surgical consideration.

This 49-year-old gentleman has had cerebral palsy all of his
life and has been cared for by his dedicated parents. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
met with them all in the office to discuss these findings and
indicated to them that he had a malignant tumor that appeared to
be confined at this point in time and amenable to local
resection. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was unconvinced given the placement of
this lesion that he could perform this endoscopically and
therefore surgical approach was required. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed
with them in depth the operation as well as the risks and
benefits involved. Among the risks included poor wound healing,
bleeding and infection as well as the chance of leaks from any
enteric openings as well as liver failure, postoperative
hemorrhage or any other intra-abdominal infections. They
understood these risks and wished to proceed and provided
informed consent to that effect. They understood entirely that
he had early Trials-8 cirrhosis and that he was at heightened
risk for any operative intervention given this.

In addition to the preop workup, a CAT scan showed extensive
lymphadenopathy throughout the upper abdomen. An endoscopic
ultrasound was performed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] 1 week prior to this operation and did not reveal any
diagnostic information. Therefore a lymph node biopsy as well as
a liver biopsy would be required for this operation.

On [**2194-5-1**] he elective presented for a transduodenal
resection
of a carcinoid tumor, an open cholecystectomy, a liver biopsy as
well as a lymph node biopsy.

Past Medical History:
1. renal failure and has been on dialysis three times a week.
2. cerebral palsy
3. liver fibrosis
4. retinitis pigmentosa with limited vision.
5. s/p back fixation
6. s/p left forearm AV graft for dialysis
7. s/p ERCP [**2194-3-13**]


Social History:
Social history shows that he does not smoke tobacco nor does he
imbibe alcohol, and he has had no known major environmental
exposures.

Family History:
He has a family history of pancreatic cancer with an aunt who
suffered from this. He has no family history of colorectal or
melanoma cancers; however, he had a grandmother with breast
cancer. There is no history of pancreatitis in the family
although his mother has had gallstones in the past. His uncle
has suffered from kidney and lung malignancies as well.

Physical Exam:
On physical exam, he is a pleasant-appearing male in no apparent
distress. He is surprisingly interactive and answers questions
appropriately. He has poor vision. His HEENT exam shows him to
have no scleral icterus, no lymphadenopathy and moist membranes.
His cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm without
murmurs. Pulmonary exam is within normal limits and clear to
auscultation. Musculoskeletal exam shows that he has good motor
and sensory function throughout all domains tested. He has a
dialysis shunt, which is functional with a palpable thrill in
the left arm. His skin exam is normal, and there is no evidence
of any gross lymphadenopathy.

CT Chest [**2194-5-13**]
FINDINGS: Consolidation with air bronchogram is seen in the left
lower lobe. A minimal amount of atelectasis is seen at the right
lung base. Study is somewhat limited due to respiratory motion
artifact. No nodules or areas of septal thickening are
identified. Several small pretracheal and precarinal lymph nodes
are seen. There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes,
specifically no hilar lymphadenopathy is identified. The bronchi
are patent to the segmental level. A small amount of layering
soft tissue attenuation material consistent with mucus is seen
in the upper trachea.
There are no pleural effusions. The heart is slightly enlarged.
Dense coronary calcifications are identified within the left
anterior descending
coronary artery. The aorta and pulmonary artery are unremarkable
on this non- contrast-enhanced examination. A central venous
catheter is present with its tip terminating in the distal SVC.
Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate a percutaneous
gastrostomy tube with its tip in a post-pyloric location.
Numerous portal lymph nodes are seen. These are unchanged from
the prior examination. The kidneys are atrophic and contain
numerous cysts consistent with polycystic disease, also stable
in appearance.
Osseous structures demonstrate severe scoliosis. There is a
fixation rod seen within the left paraspinal musculature.
Degenerative changes are seen
throughout the spine.

[**2194-5-20**] Parathyroid U/S:
The right thyroid lobe measures 2.1 x 1.8 x 3.0 cm. The left
thyroid lobe measures 1.8 x 1.8 x 3.3 cm. Posterior to the mid
portion of the right lobe, there is a 1.7 x 1.7 x 2.2 cm
homogeneously hypoechoic structure with mass effect on the
thyroid gland. The structure has increased peripheral
vascularity. This most likely represents a parathyroid nodule
and correlation with a sestamibi scan is recommended. There is
an additional 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.4 homogeneously hypoechoic nodule
within the right lobe of the thyroid gland.
IMPRESSION: Hypoechoic nodule with peripheral increased
vascularity posterior
to the right thyroid lobe, most likely representing a
parathyroid adenoma.
Correlation with a sestamibi scan is recommended.

[**2194-5-19**] Bedside swallow evaluation:
SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
He is unable to propel pureed food through his mouth and throat
when he swallows, leaving residue in his mouth and throat. He
needs liquid to clear the residue, but then he aspirates all
consistences after the swallow as evidenced by coughing.
Therefore, he is unsafe to take anything PO at this time. Please

repair/replace his PEG / J tube and continue NPO w/tube
feedings.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remain strictly NPO


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2194-5-1**] for the
above listed procedure.  There were no complications, and he
tolerated the procedure well.  He was monitored in the PACU
overnight for pain control and observation of his blood
pressure.  On POD 1 he was transferred to the floor.  His home
blood pressure medications were selectively restarted with
holding parameters which meant he frequently did not receive the
doses.  He was dialyzed per the renal team.  His GT was kept to
gravity. Over the next several days he had intermittent episode
of desaturation to the 80's. He was treated with nebulizers and
chest PT. Tube feeds were started via t
