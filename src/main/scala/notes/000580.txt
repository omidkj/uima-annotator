History of Present Illness:
71 yo male with 100py smoking history transferred from OSH for
cath. The patient had not seen a doctor in over 50 years. he was

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
severe global left

ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. (< 30 EF)
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation
revealed
severe three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a
distal 50%
tapering. The LAD was diffusely diseased and had a 90% stenosis
in the
mid vessel between moderate sized D1 and D2 branches. D2 had a
60%
narrowing. The LCX had a 90% ostial lesion and supplied small
OM1 and
OM2 branches before terminating in the AV groove. Both OM
branches were
diffusely diseased and sub-totally occluded. The RCA was
diffusely
diseased with a 60-80% stenoses in the proximal vessel and a 60%
distal
narrowing. A moderate sized PDA was subtotally occluded and
appeared to
fill in part via L->R collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated filling
pressures
with a mean PCWP of 27 mmHg in the setting of moderate to severe

systemic arterial hypertension. There was evidence of moderate
pulmonary
hypertension with PA pressures of 50/18/30. The cardiac output
was
mildly reduced at 4.3 L/min. No gradient across the aortic valve
was
detected.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed due to the patient's
elevated
filling pressures and recent non-invasive assessment of his
underlying
LVEF.
4. Distal aortography demonstrated moderate distal aortic
disease as
well as disease in the external iliacs.
5. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed at the conclusion of
the case
without known complication.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
3. Successful placement of an IABP.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient had a large ST elevation
MI. At cath, he was found to have 3VD and markedly elevated
filling pressures with a wedge of 27 and moderate pulmonary
hypertension and a IABP was placed in hopes that the patient
would go the CABG.  Echo on admission revealed severe LV global
hypokinesis. During the days following the diagnostic cath, he
was not a surgical candidate given his mental status (see
below). He was taken back for high-risk catherization and
received 4 [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 10157**] to the LAD lesion. He was placed on
Plavix, BB, ASA, Statin, and Acei. He will continued the Plavix
for at least 9 months. His ACE-I and BB can be titrated up as
his blood pressure and kidney function will tolerate.

2. Congestive Heart Failure - Given patients elevated filling
pressures and chest x-ray consistent with failure, patient was
diuresed in house. He was given Lasix on a prn basis. As his
oral intake increases, he may need daily Lasix.

3. Asystole/Apnea: The patient had his first asystolic pause on
[**9-18**] which was a 7 second pause with junctional escape. This
was felt to be a vagal episode as these occurred in the setting
of sleep apnea, heavy sedation, and were presence by
bradycardia. The pauses became more frequent and EP was
consulted after the patient had an 18 second asymptomatic pause.
At that time, his BB was held and EP thought that he did not
need a pacemaker given that these were vagal episodes. Since
these were related to his sleep apnea, we decided against
starting BiPap given the patients tenuous mental status and that
he would not tolerate it. The BB was added back very slowly,
however the patient had pauses of up t
