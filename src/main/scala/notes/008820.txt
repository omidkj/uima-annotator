Chief Complaint:
Afib/flutter with RVR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2643**] is a 79 year old woman with recent diagnosis of
carcinoid lung mass with mets, atrial fibrillation on lovenox,
idiopathic cardiomyopathy (EF 45%), recently hospitalized for
initiation of chemotherapy (with carboplatin/etoposide, day#1
[**2200-5-7**]) [**Date range (1) 40354**], now presenting from rehab with afib with
RVR. She noticed palpitations today at rehab and asked to be
evaluated. She was noted to be in rapid Afib with rates 150s.
Aside from palpitations, she denies symptoms of associated chest
pain, shortness of breath, nausea, lightheadedness. She was sent
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.
.
She was diagnosed with Afib in [**2-/2200**] with the workup resulting
in her neuroendocrine lung cancer diagnosis during [**4-/2200**]
hospitalization. Cancer was diagnosed when TTE showed [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7388**] vs
external compression. Subsequent CT showed large mediastinal
mass. Afib has been difficult to control since middle of
[**Month (only) 404**], thought to be related to mass effect from tumor. She
had been on sotalol, switched to dronedarone, then back to
sotalol, which was changed to diltiazem and metoprolol during
recent hospitalization in 3/[**2200**]. She has been flipping in and
out of atrial fibrillation frequently in the last few months but
notes improved control of afib since that hospitalization. Can
feel palpitations with rates >140s. She was transitioned from
dabigatran to enoxaparin during that hospitalization in setting
of biopsy and was kept on enoxaparin in case she might need a
repeat procedure.
.
In the ED inital vitals were as follows: 97.4 140 90/64 18 100%
RA.
500cc NS bolus given which brought HR down to 108. She was then
given diltiazem 5mg IV push with BP 92/60, bringing HR down to
96. During ED stay, systolic BPs ranged 87-104, appeared to have
lower systolics with elevated HRs. She received another 10mg IV
diltiazem with 30mg po diltiazem in the ED as well as magnesium
repletion and total 2L IVF. She denied any chest pain, shortness
of breath. ECG showed Afib with NA NI, new ST depression lateral
leads; repeat EKG unchanged. CXR with stable right effusion vs
elevation of right hemidiaphragm. Troponin negative x1. Labs
also significant for WBC 1.3, Hct 35.3, Na 131. Vitals in ED
prior to transfer to floor were as follows: 104/66 114,afib 22
97% on 2L NC.
.
On arrival to the ICU, she feels overall well. Denies
palpitations currently. She does report generalized fatigue,
progressive since starting chemotherapy, worse in the last two
days, such that she needs to use a walker at Rehab to help her
move around. She denies fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of
breath beyond her baseline. Her cough is unchanged from
baseline, no sputum production. No headache. Has very decreased
appetite for several days.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI . Groin rash.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies chest pain, chest
pressure. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation,
abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria,
frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.


Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- Patient developed new onset atrial fibrillation in beginning
of [**2200**], initial TTE showed slightly depressed LVEF of 45%,
initially thought to be due to her chronic alcohol use. Her
atrial fibrillation worsened despite uptitration of medication
(sotalol and dronedarone)  and her repeat TTE showed a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] vs. extrinsic mass compressing on LA. She was admitted
for evaluation and her biopsy showed neuroendocrine tumor
consistent with typical carcinoid.
- CT scan showing metastases to bone, lymph nodes and possibly
liver.
.
