Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2149-11-7**] AVR ( [**Street Address(2) 11599**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] porcine)


History of Present Illness:
77 M with ho of HTN, smoker, who presented to OSH w/SOB and had
persantine ETT. During ETT, he had tickling in his throat and
some substernal CP. EKG showed ST depressions. Pt was then sent
to the OSH ED for further evaluation. O2 sat 92%RA, CXR
consistent with CHF and he was given 40mg IV lasix. He was also
given ASA 325 and 2 SL nitro for the chest discomfort which
improved symptoms. IV Heparin drip (4000 U bolus followed by
1200 u/hr) was initiated and he was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac cath. Vitals at OSH ED:  BP 110-140/60-70's, HR  90-100
SR  with PVC's, 98% on 2 liters.
Patient, has had approx 2 months of shortness of breath, with
walking. States he has not had much of any chest pain, except
after exertion.
[**Hospital1 18**] Cath Lab: Loud systolic murmur was appreciated on exam
along with bibasilar crackles. An echo was performed and showed
critical Aortic stenosis with peak gradient 116mmHg, valve
area<0.8 cm2, EF 55%. Pt had cardiac cath revealing clean
coronaries. Pt had right groin, 5 french. Will need cath check
at 22:00. Off heparin drip.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

STUDIES:
CARDIAC CATH ([**11-4**])
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically significant coronary artery
disease.
The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA were without angiographically
significant
flow-limiting disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial
normotension.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically apparent epicardial coronary artery
disease.
2. Systemic arterial normotension.

CT CHEST W/OUT CONTRAST ([**11-5**]):IMPRESSION:
1. Minimally calcified ascending thoracic aorta.
2. Heavy aortic valvular and atherosclerotic coronary
calcifications.
Moderate cardiomegaly, predominantly left ventricular.
3. Possible pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. Right upper lobe lung lesion warrants repeat chest CT in six
months to
monitor for changes indicating bronchoalveolar carcinoma.

Carotid U/S ([**11-5**]):
FINDINGS: Duplex was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
There is mild heterogeneous plaque seen bilaterally.
On the right, peak velocities are 54, 45 and 42 in the ICA, CCA
and ECA. This is consistent with less than 40% stenosis.
On the left, peak velocities are 64, 62 and 46 in the ICA, CCA
and ECA. This is consistent with less than 40% stenosis.
There is antegrade vertebral flow bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 M with history of HTN and smoker who presented to OSH ED for
SOB, found to have ST depressions during Perstandine ETT and was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab for concern for CAD/ACS. Cardiac
cath was unremarkable, however, echo revealed critical aortic
stenosis, likely explaining patients symptoms of several months
of DOE/SOB.  The patient had a pre-op workup for AVR, and had an
AVR performed on [**2149-11-7**]. by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], please see operative
report for details. In summary he had: Aortic valve replacement
27-mm Biocor Epic tissue valve, his bypass time was 90 minutes
with a crossclamp of 60 minutes. He tolerated the operation well
and was transferred from the operating room to the cardiac
surgery ICU in stable condition on titrated phenylephrine and
propofol drips. Remained hemodynamically stable, anesthesia
reversed and patient extubated day of surgery. Weaned off
pressors- remained hemodynamically stable and transferred to the
floor on POD #1. Worked with nursing and physical therapy to
begin increasing his activity level. Gently diuresed toward his
preop weight and beta blockade titrated as tolerated. Chest
tubes and pacing wires removed per cardiac surgery protocol.
Went into A Fib and was started on amiodarone and coumadin.
Target INR 2.0-2.5. First INR check day after discharge.
Continued to make good progress and was cleared for discharge to
home with VNA on POD #5.

**** Incidental Findings on Imaging:
Right upper lobe lung lesion warrants repeat chest CT in six
months to
monitor for changes indicating bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified of this result [**11-12**] prior to discharge.
