hepatic failure with INR in 3's/coagulaopathy and hypoglycemia,
respiratory failure requiring intubation with cxr demonstrating
bilateral pleural effusion and complete left opacification,
profound metabolic and respiratory acidosis, severe pulmonary
hypertension as well as persistent hypotension requiring
neosynephrine for support.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ([**2139-3-18**]):
1. Enlargement of both lobes of the thyroid gland with
measurements provided above. Note that the entirety of the
thyroid gland was not imaged on this study and if complete
assessment is desired clinically, then a thyroid ultrasound
could be performed.
2. Slightly proximal location of endotracheal tube which could
be advanced by 1-2 cm for more optimal placement.
3. Moderate layering pleural effusions, extensive anasarca, and
ascites.
4. Marked enlargement of main pulmonary artery suggesting
pulmonary arterial hypertension. Enlargement of right atrium and
possible right ventricular enlargement. Cardiac echo confirms
the presence of a moderately dilated right atrium and moderately
dilated right ventricle, as well as pulmonary arterial
hypertension.
.
ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) PORT ([**2139-3-18**]):
The liver is diffusely echogenic without focal lesions. Moderate
amount of ascites is seen. A right-sided pleural effusion is
identified. There is no evidence of intra or extrahepatic
biliary ductal dilation. The portal vein demonstrates abnormal
venous pulsatility. The gallbladder is not distended.
.
ECHO ([**2139-3-18**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis. No intraventricular thrombus is seen. Right
ventricular chamber size is moderately dilated with severe
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
ECHO ([**2139-3-24**]):
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded.
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is probably normal.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2139-3-20**], LV and RV function have improved.
.
CT NECK W/O CONTRAST ([**2139-4-1**]):
The airway is patent. No soft tissue asymmetries are noted. The
thyroid gland is markedly enlarged. The right thyroid gland
extends superiorly to the level of the hyoid bone, and partially
extends medially into the retropharyngeal space. The left lobe
extends further inferiorly to the level of the thoracic inlet.
The portion of the thyroid gland visualized on the chest CT scan
of [**2139-3-18**] is not appreciably changed and measures 41 x
27 mm in the right lobe and 38 x 31 mm in the left lobe. The
gland is heterogeneous in appearance. Note is made of
mediastinal lymph nodes. Note is made of a moderate sized left
pneumothorax. There is an nasogastric tube and left internal
jugular central venous catheter. There are no osseous
abnormalities noted.
.
EMG ([**2139-4-3**]):
Markedly abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic evidence
for a severe generalized myopathy without significant
denervating features (as can be seen in thyrotoxic myopathy).
There is no evidence for a neuromuscular junction disorder.
There is no evidence for a significant polyneuropathy, although
a mild, length-dependent polyneuropathy cannot be entirely
excluded.
.
OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION
([**2139-4-9**]):
Pt's oral and pharyngeal swallow have improved since the last
videoswallow with improved base of tongue retraction, bolus
propulsion and increased epiglottic deflection now that the NG
Tube has been removed. Pt continued to have reduced oral control
with premature spillover and a mild swallow delay that results
in asp
