Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers, dMS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
LIJ placement, a-line

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo [**Age over 90 595**] only speaking female with dementia, DM2, CAD, HTN,
hyperlipidemia presents from NH with fevers and hypotension.
Per ED call in, she reportedly has frequent aspiration events
and was recently started on IM ceftriaxone for aspiration
pneumonia.  Today, however, she was noted to be persistently
febrile and hypotensive to the 80s systolic.  Additionally, her
right foot appeared ischemic.  Beyond son's report of generally
feeling unwell this week with increased confusion, specific
localizing sx of infection are unknown.  In the setting of
fevers and dMS, she was transferred to the ED for further
evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T: 97.1 BP: 78/33 HR: 71 RR: 19
O2sat: 97%RA.  Initial labs were notable for ARF with creatinine
elevated to 2.6, potassium of 6.0, lactate of 2.2.  UA was
positive for many bacteria, 11-20 WBCs ([**3-23**] squams).  CXR showed
bilateral opacities concerning for aspiration.  Physical exam
was notable for faint femoral pulse on RLE, absent popliteal
pulse and absent DP/PT; she had ischemic, blue toes.  Vascular
surgery was consulted and recommended amputation however felt
she was too unstable for OR.  CT head was obtained due to
increased somnolence which was negative for acute intracranial
process.  She had a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which revealed ? of
diverticulitis, marked intra- and extrahepatic ductal
dilatation, and bilateral lung opacities concerning for acute on
chronic aspiration.  She received IV zosyn and vancomycin.
Additionally she received 5L NS, however SBPs remained 70s-80s;
thus CVL was placed and she was started on levophed.
.
ROS:  Unable to obtain given patients confusion (even with
[**Name6 (MD) 595**] speaking RN) and beyond son reporting patient was "ill",
specific localizing sx not clear.

Social History:
Lives in [**Location **] at [**Hospital **] health center. She is
incontinent of bowel and bladder.  Wheelchair bound.  Son
reports able to converse and oriented to person and place at
baseline however frequently becomes more confused in setting of
infections and illness.


Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
VS: T: 99.6  BP: 94/48  HR: 92 RR: 21 O2sat: 99%3L NC
GEN: moans and speaks nonsensical words per both [**Hospital 595**]
speaking [**Name6 (MD) **] and RN
HEENT: Squeezes eyes closed tightly when attempts made to exam
pupils
CV: Borderline sinus tachy, no mrg appreciated
PULM: rhonchorus anteriorly, no wheezes, unable to examine
posteriorly as uncooperative with exam
ABD: +BS, soft, TTP diffusely however without rebound/guarding
EXT: RLE with faint femoral pulse, absent popliteal pulse,
absent DP/PT; ischemic, blue toes, pressure ulcer on heel,
pressure ischemia on posterior aspect of right calf.  Toes
appear NTTP however markedly TTP posterior calf, no drainage
appreciated.  S/P Left BKA.
NEURO: Moves all 4s spontaneously however RLE limited [**2-19**] pain.

Pertinent Results:
EKG:  NSR at rate 72, nml axis, RBBB, TWI II, aVF, TW flattening
V3-V6.  Old EKG dated [**2134-12-25**] with TW flattening inferior and
V4-V6.
.
STUDIES:
.
[**2135-7-16**] CT abd/pelvis:
1. Wall thickening and surrounding inflammatory stranding in the
sigmoid colon which may represent diverticulitis vs colon
cancer. Wall thickening of the rectum with inflammatory change.
Colonoscopy recommended.
2. Diffuse intra and extrahepatic ductal dilitation to the level
of the ampulla. No pancreatic duct dilitation. Recommend further
eval with ERCP/MRCP.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with diffuse intersitial
and parenchymal opacities in the lungs in which acute on chronic
aspiration is in the differential. Patulus esophagus with
material within the upper third.
.
[**2135-7-16**] CXR:
1. New left IJ central venous catheter with tip in appropriate
position.
2. Bilateral pulmonary patchy opacities, which are suggestive of
underlying pneumonia/aspiration and pulmonary edema.
.
[**2135-7-16**] CT head:  No acute intracranial process.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yoF with h/o dementia, CAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia p/w fever and
dMS with ischemic RLE and multiple sources of infection in
septic shock.  The pt. expired due to sepsis.
.
# Septic shock:  Multiple sources including urinary source,
diverticulitis and probable aspiration pneumonia.  Although not
clearly infected on exam, ischemic RLE also concerning.
Additionally concerning are her markedly dilated intra- and
extrahepatic ducts and elevated transaminases and alk phos
concerning for ascending infection (appears to be s/p ccy by
exam and on CT per radiology); t. bili was normal. Pt. continued
to deteriorate and was in significant discomfort, despite
aggressive pain control. A family meeting was held and a
decision was made to focus on comfort.
.
# Ischemic RLE:  Vascular was consulted and felt her ischemia
was chronic in nature however may have acutely worsened in
setting of infection and hypotension. She was deemed a poor
operative candidate due to her significant comorbidities. Her
pain was controlled with dilaudid and morphine.
.
# Elevated LFTs:  Has h/o hep C, status largely unknown.
However, in review of past labs, has never had elevated
transaminases nor alk phos.  Now with elevated transaminases and
elevated alk phos; t. bili normal.  Thought to be a result of
shock liver.

# Altered mental status:  Per son, pt. frequently becomes
confused like this in setting of acute illness.  CT head in ED
without acute process.  Suspect as above due to metabolic
abnormalities and infection on baseline dementia.  No nuchal
rigidity on exam to suggest CNS infection.
.
# Hypoxia:  Maintained good O2 sats (mid to high 90s) on 3L NC.
Chest CT calling bilateral opacities concerning for aspiration
pneumonia.  Must also consider volume overload as well as
developing ARDs in setting of septic shock. Treated with broad
coverage antibiotics.
.
# CAD/Elevated troponin: Elevated at presentation. CK's trended
down during stay.
.
# CHF:  EF 35-40% per [**2134**] TTE.  Does have interstitial
opacities on CT chest with concern for pneumonia but also c/f
volume overload.  As above, currently maintaining O2 sats on NC.

.
# DM2:  Elevated BS to 300s. Started on insulin gtt and
transitioned to SSI.
.
# Anemia:  Chronic with BL hct appears to be high 20s to low
30s; hct is currently above this range and is stable and likely
was hemoconcentrated on presentation.
