Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4975**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
82 y/o M with h/o HTN, PVD, COPD, recently discovered SDH in
[**4-19**], ESRD on HD, as well as CAD s/p kissing stents to LAD/LCx
in [**5-19**], followed by ISR of LAD in [**11-19**] and recent repeat cath
in [**6-21**] for refractory chest pain with taxus stents to 80% LAD
(distal to prior stent and 70% proximal LCx), med-flighted from
[**Hospital6 8283**] with recurrent chest pain. He was
seen in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 3 days ago at which time ([**8-24**]) he was
hypotensive by report and somewhat confused. Sent to the ED
where he received IVF and was sent home. He returned for
dialysis on [**8-25**] (the following day) where he was again found to
be hypotensive and complained at that time of multiple episodes
of CP on the day prior for which he had taken 6 ntg. He was
again referred to the ED, where his vitals were HR 68, BP 84/60.
An EKG demonstrated AF with LVH and ST depressions with TWI in
inferolateral leads, unchanged from prior EKG. His hypotension
was presumed secondary to intravascular volume depletion and
plans were made for careful IVF (given history of intubation
secondary to CHF), while holding BP meds for low blood pressure.
Cardiac enzymes were CK 22/25/22, top I =.04/.04/.03. While
there, he had a number of episodes of CP that were poorly
responsive to ntg, requiring multiple doses of MSO4 for relief.
He was started on a heparin gtt on the night of [**8-26**]. On [**8-27**],
just after dialysis, he again developed left sided CP which he
describes as radiating to left shoulder with SOB, relieved with
nitropaste 1". He was continued on [**Month/Year (2) **], Plavix, and received
metoprolol 25 mg as tolerated by blood pressure while at OSH. It
was decided, given recurrent CP, to transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**]
for urgent cath rather than waiting until Monday, and he was
transferred on heparin drip and 3 L NC oxygen. Of note,
patient's INR today 2.2 and had been given coumadin for AF at
[**Hospital3 4298**]. Of note, patient with SDH in [**4-19**]. CT at MVH
showed stability. Patient is inactive physically at baseline.

Echocardiogram [**4-21**]:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. All four pulmonary veins
identified and enter the left atrium.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV
cavity. Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal
LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient. No LV mass/thrombus.
LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal  anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior
- normal; mid inferior - normal; basal inferolateral - normal;
mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid
anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex -
normal;
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta. Mildly dilated descending aorta. Focal
calcifications in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
No masses or vegetations on aortic valve. Mild AS.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial

GENERAL COMMENTS: The TEE probe was passed with assistance from
the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient was
under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated.  Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

C.Cath [**6-21**]
COMMENTS:
1 Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel CAD. The LMCA was calcified with minimal

disease. The LAD had ostial 50% prior to the old stent and an
80% focal lesion at the septals. The LCX had a 70% proximal
stenosis. The RCA was small with non-critical diffuse disease.
2 Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left
sided
filling pressure with RVEDP=16 mmHg and LVEDP=20 mmHg. The
cardiac
output was preserved with CI=3.8 L/min/m2.
3 Interrogation of the aortic valve demonstrated minimal aortic
stenosis with a mean gradient of 17 mmHg and a calculated
[**Location (un) 109**]=2.1 cm2.
4 The LAD lesion was predilated with a 2.5 X 15mm NC Ranger
balloon and stented with a 3.0 X 16mm Taxus stent with lesion
reduction from 80% to 0%. The final angiogram showed TIMI III
flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection and no
embolisation. (see PTCA comments)
5. The LCX lesion was directly stented with a 3.5 X 12mm Taxus
stent
with lesion reduction from 70 percent to 0 percent. The final
angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection or
embolisation. (See PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel CAD.
2. Mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
3. Minimal aortic stenosis.
4. Successful stenting of the LAD (Drug eluting)
5. Successful stenting of the CX (Drug eluting)
.
82 yo M with HTN, hypercholesterolemia, PVD, CAD s/p stents to
LAD/LCx as recently as [**6-21**], with recent SDH in [**4-20**] (small),
presents with chest pain at rest with intentions for
catherterization. Patient currently CP free.

1. Chest pain- Not convincingly cardiac given EKG relatively
unchanged from prior (possibly increased ST depression in
lateral leads) and no increase in cardac enzymes despite
numeraous episodes of CP over last few days. Possibly some
volume related hypoperfusion in the setting
