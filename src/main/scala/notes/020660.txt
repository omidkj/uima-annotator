HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 33-year-old
gentleman with a history of a motor vehicle accident complicated
by a seizure disorder who presents with a left hip fracture after
a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.

The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident
approximately one year prior to admission.  After this
accident, he was diagnosed with a generalized seizure
disorder.  He was treated with Dilantin.

Shortly before his admission, the Dilantin was discontinued.
One day prior to admission, he experienced a generalized
tonic-clonic seizure complicated by a left-sided hip
fracture.

On [**2124-2-4**] the patient underwent open
reduction/internal fixation of his left hip.  Following this
procedure, he was bradycardic with a heart rate in the 30s,
and he experienced chest pressure.  Of note, this occurred
during a Dilantin load.  Following this episode, he
experienced sinus tachycardia and hypotension, as well as
pulmonary edema.  At this point, he received adenosine
following which he experienced a ventricular fibrillation
arrest.  He was defibrillated with one shock and entered a
normal sinus rhythm.

An initiation transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated
global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 15% to 20%.
He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit and was
initially treated with Lasix and a beta blocker.  This
improved his pulmonary edema, but he experienced hypotension
and required pressors.  Of note, he was also treated with
Ancef for six days during his Intensive Care Unit stay.

The Cardiology and Electrophysiology Services were consulted
and determined that the patient's ventricular fibrillation
arrest was most likely due to his receiving adenosine.  He
was gradually weaned off Dilantin and started on Keppra for
seizure prophylaxis.  He was also started on Lovenox for
anticoagulation.  He was successfully extubated on
postoperative day two.  His blood pressure remained low,
however.  He was eventually weaned off pressors, and by
postoperative day five was clinically stable.

A transthoracic echocardiogram performed on postoperative day
five showed significant improvement.  The ejection fraction
was noted to be 45%.  On postoperative day six, he was
considered stable for transfer to the floor.

The patient is now admitted to the [**Hospital6 **]
for further workup.

4.  Left eye blindness.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home included
Dilantin.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Zofran 2 mg to 4 mg q.4h. as needed.
2.  Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously once per day.
3.  Keppra 500 mg by mouth twice per day.
4.  Calcium gluconate.
5.  Famotidine 20 mg by mouth twice per day.
6.  Tylenol 1000 mg by mouth four times per day as needed.
7.  Dilaudid 2 mg to 4 mg by mouth q.3-4h. as needed.
8.  Magnesium oxide.
9.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, ethanol, or drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient's temperature was 98.8 degrees
Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 80, his blood pressure was
111/59, his respiratory rate was 33, and his oxygen
saturation was 97% on 2 liters.  In general, the patient was
a well-appearing gentleman in no apparent distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
The extraocular movements were intact.  The sclerae were
anicteric.   Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezes, rhonchi,
or rales.  Extremities were warm and well perfused.  No
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  The left hip incision was
clean, dry, intact, and nontender.  The abdomen was nontender
and nondistended.  There were positive bowel sounds.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 7.3, his
hematocrit was 37.7, and his platelets were 347.  Chemistry-7
was normal.  Blood cultures revealed no growth to date.
Urine cultures were no growth to date.  Catheter tip cultures
were negative.  Sputum culture revealed normal flora.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed
improving pulmonary edema.

Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2124-2-9**] revealed an
ejection fraction of 45%.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient was noted to be
cardiovascularly stable.  He received two doses of
intravenous Lasix to improve his pulmonary edema.

2.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient's dose of Keppra was
increased to 1000 mg by mouth twice per day (per Neurology
recommendations).  The patient showed no signs of seizure
activity.

3.  ORTHOPAEDIC ISSUES:  The patient was continued on
Lovenox.  Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy
consultations were obtained.  The patient received Dilaudid
for pain control.

4.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient's
electrolytes were stable, and he was tolerating a by mouth
diet.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home with
services.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Left hip fracture.
2.  Hypoxia.
3.  Cardiac arrest.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Keppra 1000 mg by mouth twice per day.
2.  Percocet one to two tablets by mouth q.4-6h. as needed.
3.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
4.  Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously once per day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 46627**] in 7 to 10 days and to call
the office of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to schedule an orthopaedic
appointment in 7 to 10 days.
