KUB [**2128-10-8**] - There is free air under the left and right
hemidiaphragms
consistent with outside hospital CT scan. No evidence of
obstruction.

Gastrograffin enema - Perforation of the proximal sigmoid colon
with extravasation of contrast medially in relation to the
sigmoid colon.

CTA PE [**2128-10-16**]:
1. Multiple acute pulmonary emboli scattered throughout the
segmental
pulmonary arterial tree and distal aspects of the right and left
main
pulmonary arteries, detailed above. Pulmonary arterial clot
burden is likely increased in comparison to [**2128-10-7**]
outside abdomen and pelvis CT examination, which also
demonstrated incidentally noted pulmonary emboli.
2. Main pulmonary artery enlargement and mild straightening of
the
interventricular septum with small amount of reflux of contrast
material into the IVC are suggestive of right heart strain
radiographically.
3. Wedge-shaped ground-glass opacity in the periphery of the
right upper lobe posteriorly may represent a small area of
pulmonary hemorrhage/infarction.
4. Right lower lobe atelectatic changes.
5. Interval resolution of previously seen free intraperitoneal
air in the
upper abdomen in comparison to [**2128-10-7**] abdomen and
pelvis CT
examination.
6. Calcified coronary artery atherosclerotic disease.




Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to neurology for flare of
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 22363**] [**Last Name (un) 2902**], he was found to have incidental finding of
intraperitoneal free air concerning for
perforated diverticulitis vs perforated sigmoid adenocarcinoma
on CT scan and was initially managed conservatively.
Gastrografin study performed on [**2128-10-12**] showed extravasation of
contrast from the sigmoid colon.  He was taken to the OR on
[**2128-10-12**] and had a sigmoid colectomy and hartmann's procedure
done. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid IV/PCA
with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral
intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.
Neurology followed pt through hospitalization and helped manage
steroid regimen. Pt began steroid taper on POD 2 and tolerated
wean well. He was sent home on 20mg of prednisone daily and this
was schedule to decrease to a maintenance dose of 10mg
prednisone PO daily after 5 days. Patient was also scheduled to
see the neurology service as an outpatient to follow this up.

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: On POD 2 patient was noted to have desaturation
episodes on ambulation down to the mid 80's on room air. He had
a CTA looking for PE done wand was found to have bilateral PEs.
At this point he was started on a heparin drip and quickly
became theraputic. On POD6 he was started on coumadin and at the
time of discharge he was sent home on a lovenox to coumadin
bridge. At time od discharge he was not having issues with SOB
on ambulation and stated he felt at his baseline. He had
bilateral LE ultrasuonds looking for a source of the PEs, that
were negative.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until
tolerating oral intake. His diet was advanced to sips on POD 2.
On POD 3 he had return of bowel function and his diet was
advanced as tolerated to regular. Foley was removed on POD 2.
Intake and output were closely monitored.

ID: Post-operatively, the patient was started on Zosyn, which
was continued through POD 2. The patient's temperature was
closely watched for signs of infection, which there were none.
As soon as he was taking POs again his prophylactic bactrim
double strength was restarted.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible. Subcutaneous heparin was transitioned into heparin
drip after the PEs were discovered.

At the time of discharge on POD 8, the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.
