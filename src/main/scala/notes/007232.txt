FINDINGS: Heart is mildly enlarged but stable in size.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt had uncomplicated angio on [**2-22**] showing one vessel run-off to
the peroneal artery followed by R fem-peroneal BPG on [**2135-2-26**].
Shortly after bypass (evening of [**2-26**]) pt had some chest pain EKG
and enzymes were sent. Pt was given nitroglycerin, morphine,
oxygen was already on asprin. Pt was transused 2 units of blood
for HTC of 24 on [**2-27**] and 1 unit on [**2-28**]. He HTC responded
appropriated.  Other then a brief episode of chest pain pt has
been asymptomatic vital signs have been stable. Wound culture
had no growth.

Pt has been on Piperacillin-Tazobactam on [**2-27**] but these were
changed to fluc and cipro (pt has UTI with cultures pending).
She is on plavix and subQ heparin for anticoagulants. We will
continue cipro for 7 days, Fluc has been DC'd.

Pt had off and on chest pressure. serial EKG not significant.
Last EKG as below showed significant changes.

EKG: [**3-1**]: Normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads
V3-V6, III and aVF
suggestive of inferolateral myocardial ischemia. Compared to the
previous
tracing of [**2135-2-28**] the T wave inversions are new. Clinical
correlation is
suggested.

Consulted Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], Performed cardiac cath. Stented RCA. No
complications.
