Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27628**] is a 32y/o gentleman with new diagnosis of AML who
has recently undergone 7+3 therapy.
.
#AML: The patient was diagnosed with AML on BMB, and has
tolerated 7+3 therapy without complaint. Patient was started on
an aggressive hydration regimen with bicarbonate as well as
hydroxyurea and allopurinol in order to bring down the WBC
burden as well as prevent tumor lysis syndrome.  Bone Maroow
Biopsy at Day 14 showed a clean bone marrow.  Patient's counts
began to slowly recover around Day 20 and was discharged on Day
+ 27.
.
#Hypoxia: On [**10-11**] pt spiked a fever and had need for
supplemental O2 to maintain sats. On [**10-12**] he continued to have
fevers and had increase in oxygen demand requiring a
non-rebreather in order to keep sats in the 90s and was
accordingly transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxia. His CXR at the
time showed moderate-severe new pulmonary edema. Pt was given 2
doses of 20mg IV lasix with good urine response. Vancomycin and
cefepime had been started (see below) and levofloxacin was
started to cover atypicals. Pt was supported in the evening on a
non-rebreather but then O2 was tapered as pt showed improvement
in saturations. CXR on [**10-13**] showed significant improvement in
pulmonary edema s/p lasix diuresis. Another 20mg IV lasix was
given with good response and pt transferred back to floor on 2L
NC. ECHO was perfomred to look for signs of cardiotoxicty and
decrased EF [**2-25**] chemotherapy, but was unrevealing; inital
concerns about an ASD were put to rest after a ubble study was
negative for ASD.
.
# Neutropenic Fever: When pt spiked initial fever Cefepime was
started although not technically neutropenic at the time. Vanco
had been added as well at time of ICU transfer. Levofloxacin was
started to cover possible atypical PNA organisms. ID was
consulted, and he completed 5 days of coverage with Levofloxacin
for atypical organisms.  Vancomycin was subsequently DC'ed, and
the patient continued on Cefepime, Acyclovir, and fluconazole.
Patient subsequently began to have 4 consecutive days of low
grade fever to 99-100.  He was restarted on IV Vancomycin.  CT
Scan of the chest showed several lung nodules that may represent
new area of infection.  As his ANC increased, his fevers began
to fade.  He was transitioned to PO Levofloxacin for 7 days on
discharge to cover the likely infection in his lungs.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine was slightly elevated upon admission, and rose
even further prior to tranfser tot he ICU. It has since
normalized [**2-25**] diuresis both within the ICU and on the floor.
.
# Anemia: Patient has become transfusion dependent for both RBC
and plts during admission, and was supported with multiple
transfusions.
.
# ? Aneurysm: Patient had an MRI head with contrast to explore
possible CNS involvement of the AML as he was having 2 days
worth of headaches.  The headaches subsequently faded and
decision was made to not to an LP.  The MRI showed a possible
anueurysm in the internal carotid artery; however, the read was
that it was a likely artifact.  MRA was done, which showed the
finding was an artifact from the tourtuous nature of the
internal carotid artery.
