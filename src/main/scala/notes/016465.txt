and heroin.  The patient presented to the ED with [**Last Name (un) **] (BUN 42,
cre 3.3, K+ 3.0) a leukocytosis (wbc 21),  and hct 34.7 and CKP
4912.  The initial chest xray showed bilateral patchy
infiltrates.   The patient was given IVF for her [**Last Name (un) **] which
improved.  Her blood cultures grew MRSA. She was started on
Vancomycin IV, Azithromycin IV and Zosyn IV. A CT of her chest
demonstrated on [**7-18**] demonstrated multiple cavitary pneumonic
lesions. Given significant concern for septic endocarditis, a
TTE was performed and demonstrated no vegetations.  Leukocytosis
persisted, MRSA grew from her sputum cx, additional blood
cultures were positive for MRSA and she continued to spike
fevers despite broad spectrum antibiotics. In this clinical
setting, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for tertiary care.
