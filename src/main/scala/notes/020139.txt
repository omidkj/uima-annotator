Allergies:
morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, AMS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
36yo male with history of asthma, alcoholism and mood disorder
who presents with respiratory distress.
.
The patient was apparently drunk this evening and was with the
police when he developed sudden onset shortness of breath and
wheezing.  EMS was called and the patient was found to be
hypoxic.  He was placed on NRB and brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
further management.
.
On arrival, vital signs were T- 97.3, HR- 95, BP- 171/126, RR-
24, SaO2- 90% on NRB.  The patient has had multiple visits to
the ED here in the past for asthma but has "never looked like
this."  He was tachypneic and with increased work of breathing
with saturations in the upper 80s on room air.  In addition, he
had poor mental status as he was drousy and difficult to arouse.
 The patient would respond to commands but then would dose off
immediately.  He was on the verge of intubation given his work
of breathing and mental status.  He received Duonebs x 3 with
some improvement.  He also received subQ epinephrine,
methyprednisolone, benedryl and magnesium, to which he responded
well to.  He was placed on heliox (80/20) with subsequent
improvement in his lung exam, respiratory rate, and oxygen
saturation (up to 93%).  Labwork was pertinent for positive
urine benzos, a peripheral eosinophilia (has had in the past),
and normal electrolytes.  CXR was unrevealing and EKG
demonstrated sinus rhythm with no ST changes.  He is being
admitted to the ICU given tenous respiratory status.  On
transfer to the ICU, vital signs were T- 98.2, HR- 95, BP-
123/63, RR- [**1-14**], SaO2- 91% on heliox.
.
On arrival to the MICU, vital signs were T- 96.5, HR- 94, BP-
115/78, RR- 16, SaO2- 97% on 80/20 heliox.  Patient was somewhat
drowsy but oriented.  Patient was on continous albuterol.  Of
note, patient was taken off oxygen briefly and maintained
saturation in the high 90s while awake.  He was placed back on
oxygen when sleeping with maintenance of saturation.  He reports
using crack this evening.  Shortness of breath has improved
since arrival to the ED.  He denied any chest pain or fever.

PERTINENT LABS
CXR [**11-18**]
FINDINGS: The lungs are fully expanded and clear. No pleural
effusion,
pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is present. The heart,
mediastinal and
pleural surface contours are normal.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
36yo male with history of alcoholism and asthma who presents
with acute respiratory distress and hypoxia.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
1.  Respiratory distress: Given history of asthma, eosinophila,
and response to duonebs/steroids, asthma exacerbation is a
possibility.  Bronchospasm secondary to drug use or inflammatory
etiology is also possible.  He was treated with heliox,
albuterol neb q3hr and po steroid.  His O2 saturation was > 93%
on face mask.  Cardiac event less likely given age and negative
enzymes.  No evidence of pneumonia either clinically or
radiographically.  We entertained possibility of PE and
endocarditis, but work up was terminated after patient left AMA
after morning round.  Given peripheral eosinophilia, also
entertained possibility of underlying interstitial process from
inhalation exposure.
.
2. Altered mental status: Serum tox was negative (includ
