Admission Date: [**2173-6-26**]        Discharge Date: [**2173-7-2**]


Service:  NSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 92-year old
female who underwent an unintentional fall on the day of
admission with questionable loss of consciousness.  The event
was not witnessed.

She was transported to [**Hospital6 2561**] where she was
found to be stable with a large head laceration.  She had a
CT scan which revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage (right
temporooccipital) and a scalp hematoma.  In addition to the
subarachnoid hemorrhage, she had a small subdural hematoma.


The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further evaluation.  A repeat head CT showed no
change when compared to the film at [**Hospital3 **].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for atrial fibrillation
and congestive heart failure.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Klor-Con, digoxin, Synthroid,
Lasix, vitamin B12, and Cartia XL.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature on admission
was 97.8, pulse was 82, blood pressure was 120/59,
respiratory rate was 16, and oxygen saturation was 99 percent
on room air.  On examination, the patient was in no acute
distress and alert.  She was found to have a large 4-cm
posterior head laceration.  Her pupils were equally round and
reactive to light.  No hemotympanum, or rhinorrhea, or
otorrhea.  She had a cervical collar in place.  Her lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Her heart rate was
irregular.  There was no abdominal tenderness or distention.
Her rectal examination revealed no masses and was guaiac
negative.  She had an open laceration on her left shin.
Neurologically, she was intact.  She was moving all
extremities with no focal neurologic deficits.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count was
12.5, hematocrit of 40.2, and platelets of 308.  INR was 1.1.
Sodium was 135, potassium was 4.9, chloride was 99, and
bicarbonate was 19.5.

RADIOLOGY:  She had an EKG which showed an irregular rhythm
with atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately 100.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Neurosurgery Service and repeat head CTs performed. her hospital
course were stable.  She was placed
on seizure prophylaxis, Dilantin 75 mg t.i.d., stress ulcer
prophylaxis, and lansoprazole 30 mg q.d., and she was
continued on her home medications.

Due to multiple episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation a
Cardiology consultation was obtained, and it was recommended
that she receive a transthoracic echocardiogram and to
continue her medications.  They also recommended adding an
ACE inhibitor to her medication regimen.

Because the etiology of her fall was unknown, a Medicine
consultation was obtained for a syncope workup.  They
recommended an outpatient evaluation of high calcium as her
calcium had returned elevated at 12 initially.  Repeat
calciums in the days post admission were 10.3.  They also
recommended a follow-up screening mammogram and a colonoscopy
by the patient's primary care provider as an outpatient in
addition to electrolyte management.

The patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to
the floor on hospital day three.  At that time, she was noted
to have periods of low oxygen saturations.  A chest x-ray was
obtained which revealed a left lower lobe opacification
consistent with a pneumonia versus mucus plug.  She was
started prophylactically on levofloxacin, and she was given a
pneumococcal vaccine prior to discharge.  She was placed on
subcutaneous heparin and pneumatic boots for routine DVT
prophylaxis as her head CTs  had been stable throughout the
latter half of her hospital course.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION/CONDITION:  On hospital day seven, she
was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.  She was stable
with no neurologic deficits.  She was tolerating oral intake
and working with Physical Therapy.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  Recommendation that she contact the
[**Hospital 4695**] Clinic in the case of increased headache,
confusion, visual changes, nausea, or vomiting and to
continue with Physical and Occupational Therapy at her
rehabilitation facility.  It was also recommended that she
follow up with her primary care physician for further
management of her high calcium in addition to a routine
screening mammography and colonoscopy.  She was instructed to
call the [**Hospital 4695**] Clinic to set up an appointment with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]; appropriate phone numbers were provided for her.  She
was also instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] in the
Cardiology Clinic on [**7-19**], and this appointment was made
for her.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Status post fall with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Syncope.
3. Atrial fibrillation.


MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Dilantin 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. (for a 3-week course).
3. Subcutaneous heparin 5000 units 1 injection t.i.d.
4. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. times three weeks, followed
   by 200 mg p.o. q.d. following three weeks (as recommended
   by Cardiology).
5. Diltiazem 30 mg p.o. q.i.d.
6. Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.d. (times 7 days).
