History of Present Illness:
r. [**Known lastname 41614**] is an 82M with a history of COPD (on 3L home O2),
CHF, and multifocal necrotizing pneumonia (currently on long
course of vanc/ertapenem) who presented today from OSH after a
left hip fracture. Family states he was at home stepping out of
the shower when he slipped on a wet spot on the floor and fell
on his left side. Denies LOC, denies head trauma, denies chest
pain, SOB, palpitations. He was initially [**Last Name (un) 4662**] to an OSH where
plain films showed a fracture of the neck of the L femur at the
level of IT ridge and he was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED Initial Vitals were 98.3 122 152/84 18 93% on a
Non-Rebreather. EKG showed sinus tachycardia to 107. While in
the ED he spiked to 102.5 and he was given a dose of cefepime
and 500cc of NS. He was evaluated by orthopedics in the ED who
recommended admission to medicine. He was then admitted to the
MICU for further management.

On arrival to the MICU his pain is well controlled. He is
saturating in the low 90s on 4 liters of O2 which according to
the patient's son is his baseline. He reports that he has been
having high fevers at home off and on for the past 2 months and
that a fever of 102 is not unusual for him. He had a CT chest at
[**Hospital1 **] earlier today in preparation for his ID follow-up
appointment that was scheduled for tomorrow.

In healthy persons who have a low
likelihood both of M. tuberculosis
infection and of progression to
active tuberculosis if infected, a
single positive QFT result should not
be taken as reliable evidence of M.
tuberculosis infection. Repeat
testing, with either the initial test
or a different test, may be
considered on a case-by-case basis.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Left Hip Fracture:  Patient was admitted with a left hip
fracture from a mechanical fall.  He was evaluated for
orthopedics and recommended for a total hip replacement, but was
not deemed to be a surgical candidate, as his respiratory status
was too tenuous.  He was treated with enoxaparin for DVT
prophylaxis.  Pain was managed first with a 12 mcg fentanyl
patch with dilaudid for breakthrough.  However, these therapies
were limited by respiratory suppression and delirium.  The
patient was then transitioned to tramadol and standing tylenol
for pain.  Once intubated for respiratory failure, pain was
controlled with a fentanyl drip.  Though the patient again
became eligible for a total hip replacement with intubation, it
was not pursued given overall prognosis and continued health
decline.

# Acute on chronic hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure:
The patient was admitted with worsening hypoxia and hypercarbia
secondary to previously diagnosed multifocal necrotizing
pneumonia in the setting of known COPD.  On admission, he
required a combination of 6L nasal cannula and high flow face
mask to maintain saturations 85 - 88%.  He completed a 28 day
course of vancomycin and meropenem to cover for multifocal
necrotizing pneumonia.  However, he became increasingly
hypercarbic and continued to spike fevers.  On [**2192-10-11**] the AFB
from [**2192-9-11**] was reported AFB culture positive. He was then
immediately placed on TB precautions.  With confirmation of MTB
by the state lab, the patient was initiated on RIPE therapy.
His respiratory status continued to decline and he was
intubated.  For his COPD, the patient was continued on albuterol
and roflumilast.

# CHF with history of cor pulmonale:    Throughout admission,
the patient was diuresed to euvolemia as necessary.  He was
first diuresed only with lasix, but with rising bicarbonate to
high 40s, he was transitioned to lasix and acetazolamide.  The
patient remained persistently hypoxic throughout admission.

# Diabetes Mellitus II: Home oral medications were held while
the patient was in the hospital.  He was continued on home
lantus with insulin sliding scale.

# PUD: stable, continued omeprazole

# HLD: stable, continued simvastatin

# Neuropathic pain: stable, continued gabapentin.  Gabapentin
was down-titrated with increasing delirium.

# Right Leg PVD s/p fem fem bypass: stable.  The patient was
continued on aspirin

Respiratory Distress: The patient ultimately succumed to his
multifocal pneumonia and tuberculosis and expired.
