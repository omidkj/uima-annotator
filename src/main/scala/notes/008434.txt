Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer in Shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Arterial line
Tracheal entubation


History of Present Illness:
49m with DM1, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and a recent admission
at [**Hospital3 **] for DKA and rapid afib presented to [**Hospital3 **]
[**2194-12-7**] with palpitations, was found to be in afib with rvr,
developed progressive hypotension followed by a junctional
rhythm, went into PEA, was resuscitated, and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**]
for balloon pump. At the time of presentation to GoodSam, he was
found to be in afib with heart rates in the 150s-160s. IV
metoprolol failed to provide sufficient rate control. He was
noted to be in CHF (edema on CXR and BNP of 993), so he was
given furosemide 40mg IV, producing 300ml of urine. To achieve
better rate control, an amiodarone drip was initiated, and
following this his bp dropped to the 70's, so he was started on
a phenylephrine drip and placed on a NRB-mask. He was then
transferred to the ICU where, for increasing hypotension and
respiratory distress, he was intubated and started on propofol.
After the intubation he first converted to sinus rhythm but then
dropped his P waves, went to a junctional rhythm, then PEA
arrested. He was resuscitated with CPR, 1mg each of epinephrine
and atropine, and bicarb infusions; his post-resuscitation
rhythm was sinus. Given his ongoing pressor requirements and the
feeling that he was in cardiogenic shock, he was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for a balloon pump. At the time of transfer, his vitals
were t 101.3, bp 105/p, hr 60's (on 36mcg of norepi gtt), rr 18,
and spo2 mid-high 90's on A/C 700/18/80/5. His transfer labs
were signficant for a WBC of 17.6 (up from 10), Hct of 41, plt
of 419, bicarb of 18, BUN of 20, Cr of 1.1, and ABG of
7.45/24/315/16.
.
MICU course: Spontaneously converted to sinus from afib. Altered
MS ? [**1-2**] Etoh withd but now ok. Weaned off pressors on [**12-10**].
Extubated [**12-11**]. Diuresed. Vanc and aztreonam continued for ?
sepsis. Dig started.

[**12-12**] ECG Sinus rhythm. Since the previous tracing of [**2194-12-12**]
sinus rhythm is new.
.
[**12-8**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild biventricular cavity enlargement with severe
global
biventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic,
etc. The low heart rate raises the suspicion for hypothyroidism
- though he does not have a pericardial effusion).
.
[**12-13**] Port CXR: IMPRESSION: No significant change in the
appearance of the cardiac enlargement or bilateral pleural
effusions. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists.
.
[**12-14**]
IMPRESSION: Partially occlusive clot in the lower internal
jugular vein.
.
Cath\
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease as manifest by 70%
proximal
stenosis of a moderate sized ramus branch.  There is otherwise
noncritical, but diffuse, disease of the left and right coronary

arteries.
2. Severely reduced left ventricular systolic function with
elevated
left ventricular filling pressures.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 49m with DM2, likely alcoholic cardiomyopathy who presented
to GoodSam with afib-rvr, developed shock of presumed
cardiogenic etiology, and had a PEA arrest. Here to continue to
eval etiology of cardiomyopathy.
.
#Shock -- Now resolved. Multifactorial with septic vs
cardiogenic. By ECG he did not seem to have a major ischemic
event to account for the shock. Alternatively, given his WBC and
fever, this could have been a septic picture.
- lipids with low HDL but, LDL 119 and Total chol 186
.
# Sepsis -- WBC normalized and afebrile. Unclear etiology. WBC
and fever could both be insetting of infection or PEA arrest.
Continued Abx for a total of 7 day course which was discontinued
on [**12-16**].
- Discontinued Ceftaz in CCU
- continued vanco for a total 7-day course
- continued broad abx with aztreonam for in place of ceftaz for
a total 7-day course
- f/u cultures here negative
- Was afebrile X 4 days with normal wbc count on discharge
.
# CHF: DDx alchoholic vs myopathy [**1-2**] afib vs viral. EF 15-20%
at GoodSam. CXR and vent/abg were consistent with pulm edema,
likely secondary to CHF-EF 15-18%. Will need repeat outpt echo
(in 3 months) for evaluation of cardiomyopathy and possible
primary prevention with ICD.
- continue lasix with potassium supplementation
- Cath with moderate 3VD, plan for stress in future
- will recommend he get HIV testing as outpatient
.
# Afib -- PAF. Another episode of afib with RVR during hospital
course on medical floor to HR 200s now in NSR on
