Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 40 year-old woman
who was involved in a rollover motor vehicle accident with
near amputation of the left upper extremity.  She arrived in
the trauma bay with a GCS of 15 with an odor of alcohol on
her breath and left arm pain.  There was no loss of
consciousness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive hepatitis C from blood
transfusion.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Scoliosis surgery as an adolescent.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Her temperature was 97.8.
Heart rate 107.  Blood pressure 145/80.  Breathing 20.  100%
saturation.  GCS of 15, positive alcohol on her breath.
HEENT showed dried blood.  No scalp or head lacerations or
hematoma.  Extraocular movements intact.  Pupils are equal,
round and reactive to light.  No facial step offs.  The neck
was collared.  No cervical point tenderness.  The chest was
clear without wheeze, chest wall tenderness or sternal
tenderness.  Heart was regular.  Abdomen was obese, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Pelvis was stable.  Rectal was heme
negative without mass.  Extremities the left upper extremity
had a near complete traumatic amputation with destruction of
the left elbow joint and avulsion of the extensor and flexor
tendons at their origins.  Notes fracture and dislocation of
the left elbow with a severed brachial artery.  No distal,
radial, or ulnar pulses or doppler signals.  The hand was
insensate and there was no motor function below the elbow.
The right upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities
have full range of motion.  Normal sensation and normal motor
function.  There are bilateral femoral pulses and palpable
bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Significant for white count of
23, hematocrit 38, INR 1.4.  Normal chemistries.  Alcohol
level of 217.  Normal urinalysis.  Tox screen was otherwise
normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was stabilized in the trauma
bay requiring large amounts of pain medication.  She was
intubated approximately an hour into the trauma due to
desaturation.  Plastics, orthopedics and vascular surgery
were consulted in the trauma bay to evaluate the left upper
extremity.  It was decided that the patient would go to the
Operating Room with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 13797**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] to
attempt to restore vascular supply to the arm and potential
limb salvage.  She was given Kefzol, Gentamycin and tetanus
in the trauma bay.

Other radiologic studies in the trauma bay included a trauma
series that was negative a post intubation chest film that
showed a left main intubation.  The tube was removed and
follow up chest film showed proper position of the tube.  The
patient was then taken to the Operating Room where a vascular
shunt was placed in the brachial artery.  This showed no
improvement in the distal arm.  The decision was made among
the team present that given her massive degloving injury and
no improvement after reprofusion the decision was made that
amputation would be the only viable alternative.  Orthopedic
surgery then proceeded with an amputation of the left arm
above the elbow with closure.  The patient was transferred
from the Operating Room to the trauma Intensive Care Unit
where she remained intubated.  She was hemodynamically
stable.

The following day CT of the head, abdomen, pelvis, chest and
C spine were performed that showed no acute injury.  The
patient's sedation was weaned and she was extubated on postop
day number two.  After extubation the patient was found to
have a significant oxygen requirement.  Chest x-ray revealed
pulmonary vascular congestion consistent with congestive
heart failure, consistent with her massive fluid
resuscitation around the time of her injury.  She received
intravenous Lasix and diuresed well.  Follow up chest x-ray
revealed resolution of her pulmonary vascular congestion and
her breathing improved significantly throughout her stay.
She was transferred to the floor on postop day number four.
Her dressing was changed on postop day number four.  It
showed that the wound was intact.  JP was removed on the
evening of postop day number four.

Psychiatry was involved with the patient from early in her
course and they felt that she was coping well with her new
disability.  They have arranged for outpatient follow up.
The patient is discharged to home today on postoperative day
number six.  She is ambulating well, tolerating a regular
diet.  Her pain is well controlled with po pain regimen.  She
was seen by occupational and physical therapy and they have
arranged outpatient follow up and eventual prosthetic
fitting.  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13797**] and
[**Doctor Last Name **] on [**5-3**] and she will follow up with the Trauma
Clinic next Thursday.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Oxycodone 5 to 10 mg po q 4 to 6
hours prn and Peridex 15 mg swish and spit t.i.d. prn.
