Service:  .

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Syncope.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 79 year old
woman with a past medical history of mitral valve prolapse,
supraventricular tachycardia on Atenolol, and syncope, who
presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**5-9**] status post syncopal
episode that was proceeded by nausea.  The morning of
admission, the patient stated that she had had brief loss of
consciousness.  She denies seizure activity, change in
bladder or bowel habit.  She had a history of similar
episodes in [**2158**], [**2163**] and in [**1-/2168**], with gastrointestinal
vagal symptoms.  Her initial electrocardiogram showed sinus
bradycardia with first degree AV block.  In [**Hospital3 3583**]
she developed PSVT at 200 beats per minute which resolved
with Valsalva.

In the Electrophysiology Laboratory here at [**Hospital1 346**], the patient had a AVNRT that was
ablated and they were unable to re-induce the AVNRT status
post ablation.  She reported chest pain during the ablation.
There were no EKG changes when her sheath was pulled, but
pressure decreased to the 40s.

She had an echocardiogram that showed a small 5 to 10 cc.
effusion that was stable over 90 minutes; no tap was
performed.

She received intravenous fluids, Atropine and Dopamine
transiently and her heart rate increased to the 160s and then
decreased to the 130s and then approximately 95.  She was
100% on four liters with a blood pressure of 120/60.  She was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for observation.

After transfer her vital signs were pulse 80 to 90; blood
pressure 125/63; and she reported an occasional five out of
ten chest pain that was dull and achy and worse with deep
inspiration.

ALLERGIES:   She has no known drug allergies.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Mitral valve prolapse.
2.  Billroth II gastrectomy complicated by B12 deficiency.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease.
4.  Diverticular disease.
5.  Peptic ulcer disease.
6.  Anxiety.
7.  Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ativan 0.5 mg three times a day.
2.  Zantac 150 mg twice a day.
3.  Nexium 40 mg q. day.
4.  Atenolol 25 mg q. day.

ALLERGIES:   She has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   She does not use tobacco or alcohol.  She
is a social worker.  She is divorced and lives with her sons
who are very supportive in her care.

LABORATORY:  Electrocardiogram number one, [**2168-5-11**], at
05:30 a.m. was 120 beats per minute, tachycardia, first
degree arteriovenous block with PR prolongation.  Normal
axis, poor R wave progression, QRS 0.96.  Qs in V3 through V6
and evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.

On [**2168-5-11**], at 3 p.m., the patient had paroxysmal
supraventricular tachycardia at 172 beats per minute with
left ventricular hypertrophy in Qs and V3 through V6.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs at the Coronary Care Unit
on presentation:  Blood pressure was 125/63; pulse is 87; she
was afebrile; 100% on three liters nasal cannula; 16 breaths
per minute.  She was not in no acute distress, lying flat in
bed.  Extraocular muscles are intact. Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Anicteric.
Jugular venous distention was approximately 10 centimeters
but again the patient was lying flat.  Neck was supple.
Lungs were clear to auscultation; no wheezes, rales or
rhonchi anteriorly this examination was done.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was regularly irregular and
seemed to have ventricular premature contractions, distant
heart sounds.  Pulsus was 8 millimeters of Mercury.  S1, S2,
no murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.  Groin with no
bruit.  Clear, dry and intact, no hematoma.  Two out of two
dorsalis pedis pulses on the left; on the right one out of
two.  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Present varicose
veins.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  She was
alert and oriented times three; she was pleasant.

Later electrocardiograms done on the 2nd, were normal sinus
rhythm, 81 beats per minute with occasional atrial premature
beats, prolonged PR, Qs 1 to 3 centimeters V3 through V6,
slight PR depression V2 through V6.  Slight PR elevation in
AVR, normal voltage, evidence of left ventricular
hypertrophy.

LABORATORY:  Creatinine of approximately 0.7, hematocrit of
approximately 33.0.  On presentation, her hematocrit was
35.7. with a white blood cell count of 10.8, hemoglobin 12.8,
MCV of 90 and platelets 339.

ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 79 year old woman with a past
medical history of peptic ulcer disease status post Billroth
II, diverticular disease, syncope and paroxysmal
supraventricular tachycardia who presents from the
Electrophysiology Laboratory status post ablation of AVR and
AT, complicated by pericardial effusion, decreased blood
pressure transiently requiring dopamine.

Echocardiogram showing small stable pericardial effusion.
Blood pressure stable and the pulsus is approximately 8
centimeters.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  RHYTHM:  Sinus bradycardia with VPCs, VPB, status post
ablation for AVRNAT.  Permanent pacemaker placement will be
done as an outpatient.  Beta blocker was initially held given
her hypotension.  When her pressure was stable and she was
eventually restarted on beta blocker, which was titrated up
to 25 mg three times a day and Metoprolol.

2.  HEMODYNAMICS:  The patient remained hemodynamically
stable for the rest of her hospitalization, not requiring any
more pressors.  She had a repeat echocardiogram on the third
of [**2168-5-10**].  Her left atrium was mildly dilated, right
atrium was normal in size.  Her left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and systolic function were normal.
Her ejection fraction was estimated to be 60%.

Her right ventricular cavity was dilated.  Right ventricular
systolic function was normal.  Aortic root was normal in
diameter.  No aortic regurgitation; trivial mitral
regurgitation; two plus tricuspid regurgitation.  Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There was a small
pericardial effusion that was circumferential and compared to
the prior study on [**2168-5-11**], the pericardial effusion
appeared slightly smaller than the prior study, and there was
no atrial indentation.

3.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  There was no evidence of
congestive heart failure throughout the remainder of her
stay.  We monitored for obstructive physiology by following
pulsus which was approximately 8 and jugular venous pressure
which was approximately 9.  The echocardiogram was repeated
as stated above, earlier.  For coronary artery disease, the
patient has a known coronary artery disease history.

4.  VALVULAR:  The echocardiogram revealed two plus tricuspid
regurgitation.

5.  HEMATOLOGIC:  Hematocrit, coagulation studies and
platelets were followed.  Hematocrit had been 33 at the
outside hospital and was 35 initially on presentation here,
then 31 initially presenting to the Coronary Care Unit.  On
the [**5-12**], the hematocrit was 25.9.  The patient
received two units of packed red blood cells with a bump to
31.6.  By the date of discharge, it was 36.6 without any
further transfusions.

It should be noted that the patient had received intravenous
fluids during her episodes of hypotension and the low
hematocrit may have represented fluid shifts.

6.  PULMONARY:  The patient has no history of pulmonary
disease, however, given the pulmonary hypertension, this
issue should be followed up as an outpatient.

7.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  Proton pump inhibitor for
gastrointestinal prophylaxis.

8.  RENAL:  The patient's renal function remained stable
throughout her hospital course.

9.  PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient received Ativan p.r.n. for
anxiety.

10. PAIN:  Chest pain likely secondary to procedure.  The
patient received Tylenol and percocet as well as occasional
doses of intravenous morphine for her chest pain.  NSAIDs
were avoided.

11. PROPHYLAXIS:  For gastrointestinal, Protonix, deep vein
thrombosis Pneumoboots.

The patient was transferred from the Coronary Care Unit to
the floor.  She was seen by Physical Therapy and was
ambulating without assistance.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Good.
