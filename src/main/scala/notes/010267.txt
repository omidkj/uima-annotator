History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year old male with history of PE (dx in [**Month (only) 547**]
[**2105**], left main and subsegmental PE), CAD, atrial fibrillation,
COPD who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with the shortness of breath
at rest over the past few days.  During this time, he also had
4/10 L The patient had initially been on Coumadin for his PE but
that was later discontinued [**12-25**] a GIB.  He was later placed on
Lovenox, but this was stopped for an unclear reason.
.
Given the patient's chest pain and shortness of breath he was
transferred here for further mgmt,  In the ED he was tachycardic
to 102 and SBPs were 96/31.  He received IVF.  He was started on
levophed and received vancomycin, levaquin and flagyll. CT-A was
done which showed multiple segmental and subsegmental pulmonary
emboli. The patient was started on heparin and tx to the MICU
for further mgmt.
.
Of note the patient was hospitalized in [**2106-11-23**] with PNA
and COPD exacerbation.  He was discharged on Levaquin and a
steroid taper.
He also has a h/o klebsiella, MRSA, [**Year (4 digits) **]
and pseudomonas in sputum.
.
.
ROS: Aside from the aforementioned, the patient reports a 60
pound wt loss over the past 1.5 months.  He reports having no
appetite or energy.  As stated above he does report chest pain
and shortness of breath.  He denies any GI sx.  He does have a
hx of BPH.

ECG shows RBB which is unchanged, nsr 104 bpm

IMAGING:
CTA chest [**2107-1-27**]:
1. Multiple new segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli
compared to the prior CT.
2. Persistence over two months of consolidation in the posterior
right upper lobe with right hilar adenopathy, likely reactive.
Differential diagnosis includes persistent aspiration pneumonia.
Underlying mass cannot be excluded.
3. Moderately severe centrilobular emphysema.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
5. Enlarged thyroid gland.


ECHO [**2107-2-14**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in size. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavaity size and dynamic systolic function (LVEF >75%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. A moderate (peak 36mmHg) mid-cavitary
gradient is identified. There is no resting LVOT gradient. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. with normal cavity
size and free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (?#)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a prominent anterior fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-1-28**] an
LV mid-cavity gradient is now identified (may have been present
previously, but was not interrogated). Systolic function is
similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 80 year-old male with coronary artery disease, atrial
fibrillation, pulmonary emboli, multiple severe GI bleeds in the
setting of anticoagulation for above, S/P IVC filter placement,
S/P NSTEMI, S/P intubation for respiratory failure(pneumonia,
COPD, etc.), S/P Stroke with left-arm & leg deficits, and acute
anuric renal failure in setting of septic shock.

For his respiratory failure, he required a course of steroids
for COPD and for PNA, multiple courses of antibiotics, most
recently on linezolid and meropenem for Multidrug-resistant
Klebsiella (to complete course on [**2107-3-20**]).  Patient also
developed line infection with coagulase negative Staph
bacteremia on [**2107-2-20**], and was treated by removing line and
Vancomycin course.  Infections were complicated by intermittent
septic shock which temporarily required vasopressors and IV
fluid resuscitation.  His multiple episodes of septic shock
complicated by acute oliguric/anuric renal failure with
resultant volume overload, that was intermittently responsive to
vasopressors as well

He was unable to wean from ventilator so tracheostomy/PEG were
placed.  The patient subsequently developed ventilator
associated pneumonia, for which he is on his current antibiotic
course (Linezolid and Meropenem until [**3-20**]).  Given the
patient's continued decline, multiple family meetings led to
readdressing goals of care.  It was agreed that the following
would no longer be pursued: vasopressors and fluid boluses for
hypotension/oliguria, renal replacement therapy (either CVVHD or
intermittent HD) for his anuric renal failure, anticoagulation
for stroke/CAD/atrial fibrillation.  While hospitalized, patient
continued to accumulate substantial amounts of fluid due to
exogenous administration for hypotension in setting of
hypoalbuminemia and renal failure, which led to marked anasarca,
and marked amount of pain related to the oedema and the skin
ulcerations.  For this reason, his pain medication regimen was
uptitrated to oxycodone via G-tube 15mg q6 hours, fentanyl patch
(absorption probably variable given oedema), and intermittent IV
morphine 2-4mg.  Due to continued deterioration, he was made
comfort measures only and expired on [**2107-3-20**].
