History of Present Illness:
53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
increasing SOB x5d. 5d ago he noted DOE while climbing flight of
stairs. It was sudden onset and not a/w nausea, CP, diaphoresis.
SOB persisted throughout day and was worse with lying flat. He
also reports significant bilat lower ex and abd edema and approx
5 lb weight gain in 2d. SOB persisted and was worsened with any
physical activity. He said he could "talk it down" until day of
admit when it worsened. He denies any cough, chills, fevers, or
chest pain. He has no hx of CAD, CHF and no new meds.
.
In the ED, 96.8 102/78 73 16 100% RA. Promptly went into HR of
130s with aflutter and SBP 120s. Exam showed cool extremities
and bibasilar rales. He was given Dilt 20 IV and 30 PO with HR
improvement to 110 and SBP 130 -> 80s. He needed 600 IVF. Neo
given intermittently with no improvement in HR. EKG aflutter
with NA, NI and ventricular rate of 130 w delayed RWP. Labs
showed Trop 0.02, CK 187, MB 10. INR 1.7, WBC 15.8, ARF (Cr 2.4)
and transaminitis (ALT [**2055**] and AST 736). Anion gap 17 and
lactate 3.4. CXR w pulm congestion. CT abd showed cirrhotic
liver with small ascites w small/mod bilateral pleural
effusions. He was given [**Last Name (LF) 94463**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325. ECHO in ED showed
mod MR so patient admitted to CCU for cardiogenic shock.
.
Currently, he is thirsty. On full ROS, he denies any dizziness,
HA, LH, nausea, CP, SOB. he reports increasing abdominal girth
and leg swelling over last several days. Denies any fevers,
chills, cough, sputum.

Radiology

CT Abd/Pelvis [**2124-7-8**]
1. Findings suggestive of fluid overload, with small-to-moderate
bilateral
pleural effusions, with hilar fullness in the visualized lung
bases.
2. Nodular contour of the liver, which can be seen with
cirrhosis, with a
small amount of ascites.
3. Rounded hypodensities in the right lobe of the liver are
incompletely
characterized without intravenous contrast.
4. Cystic structure inferior to the third portion of the
duodenum. This is
of uncertain etiology with differential diagnostic
considerations including a fluid-filled normal bowel loop,
duplication cyst, and duodenal diverticulum.

C. Cath [**2124-7-11**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
no angiographically apparent CAD.
2. An 8Fr 30cc intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted via a
right common
femoral artery with good diastolic augmentation and systolic
unloading.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Cardiogenic shock.
3. Insertion of IABP.

TTE [**2124-7-11**]
Mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. LV wall thicknesses normal. LV mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
20-25 %). Restrictive left ventricular filling pattern
suggestive of severe diastolic dysfunction. RV is dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. Normal aortic valve. 3 +
MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] htn.

TTE [**2124-7-14**]
On IABP: There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 20 %). RV with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Off IABP: Overall LV
systolic function remains severely depressed with some subtle
increased systolic thickening of the anterior and lateral LV
segments (LVEF 25-30%). The degree of mitral regurgitation
increased to moderate to severe (3+). Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2124-7-11**], overall LV systolic
function appears slightly improved and the degree of MR less


Brief Hospital Course:
# Cardiogenic shock: Patient admitted with cardiogenic shock.
Work up for causes was unremarkable, including Cath revealing
clean coronaries, HIV, Iron studies, RF, [**Doctor First Name **] and TSH. EF is
depressed globally without regional wall motion abnls and
improved on IABP. TTE showed mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. LV wall thicknesses
normal. LV mildly dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). Restrictive left
ventricular filling pattern suggestive of severe diastolic
dysfunction. RV is dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. Normal aortic valve. Mild PA htn. TTE also showed
3+ MR, but it was unknown how much this complicated patient's
Cardiogenic shock picture. A repeat TTE on [**7-14**] showed minimal
improvement in EF on IABP and unchanged MR. In addition, patient
was admitted in A flutter and it was felt that this rhythm
disturbance on top of an already compromised EF caused the
patient to go into cardiogenic shock. Patient was initially
managed on Milrinone and Dopamine, but an IABP was placed during
patient's cardiac catheterization. Milrinone was eventually
weaned off and replaced by afterload reduction by ace
inhibitors, which were slowly titrated up and eventually, the
patient's IABP was able to be removed on [**2124-7-19**].  He was also
re-started on B-blocker the
