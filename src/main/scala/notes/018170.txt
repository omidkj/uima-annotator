Chief Complaint:
worsening speech difficulties and decreased movement of the
right arm

tracheostomy
PEG tube

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 50 year-old right-handed man with a recent
history of HSV encephalitis who presents with worsening speech
difficulties and decreased movement of the right arm.  He was
initially diagnosed with HSV 1 meningitis on [**2190-4-23**].  He
presented after he was in an accident while driving from RI to
VT, rented a second car, and was in a second accident, at which
point he was brought to an outside hospital and eventually
diagnosed with HSV meningitis.  He was started on a course of IV
acyclovir, and discharged to [**Hospital 38**] rehab.  His rehab course
was complicated by a lower extremity DVT, for which he was
started on Coumadin, however on [**5-15**] there was concern that the
clot was mobile, and on [**2190-5-16**] he had an IVC filter placed.
Around this time he became febrile to 102.6, and on [**5-18**] was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for fever and worsening confusion.  He was
admitted from [**Date range (1) 66375**], during which time he underwent a repeat
LP, which showed 56 WBCs and a protein of 83, but was HSV
negative.  He had blood and urine cultures that were also
negative.  His fevers resolved with restarting acyclovir, though
his mental status continued to fluctuate, and he was sent back
to
rehab on [**5-21**].  His sister continued to visit him, and reports
that even as recently as two days ago he was actually starting
to
improve.  At his best he was reported to be communicative, with
a
slightly strange affect, and mild short term memory and
executive
function impairment.  However, on [**5-26**] he was noted to be very
unsteady with PT, and was found to be orthostatic as low of SBP
of 60 when standing, and it was recommended that he start both
fludrocortisone and midodrine.  On [**5-27**] the patient was noted to
be forcibly keeping his right eye closed, and also was felt to
be
more apraxic with worsening coordination.  He was also felt to
not be moving his right arm as frequently.  For all of this he
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Exam fluctuates significantly throughout.
Alert,
oriented to self but states it is [**Month (only) 956**], then starts reciting
[**2184**]..[**2185**]..[**2186**] when asked the year.  Later can state [**2190**] and
that the president is [**Last Name (un) 2753**].  States he is at [**Hospital 38**] Rehab.
Has intermittent dysarthria, most notable with '[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]' '[**Last Name (Prefixes) **]' and
'ka'
sounds, but this fluctuates.  Can follow simple midline and
appendicular commands, though with two step commands, such as
'take your left hand and touch your right ear' looks at his left
hand, picks it up, then holds it over his head.  When asked what
he is supposed to be doing states 'I'm supposed to touch my
right
ear' but never actually does it, and when asked a minute later
what he is supposed to be doing states 'picking my nose' (still
with his left arm held suspended above his head).  Able to read,
though periodically adds the word 'hospital' into sentences (e.g
'near the table in the hospital dining room').  Can name the
key,
glove and feather on the stroke card, but says 'tetanus with a
shower in between' for the cactus, a nonsensical word for the
chair and 'nice...a mattress' for the hammock.  Able to count to
20 forwards, but when counting backwards makes it to 12, then
repeats 12, 13, 12, 11, 12, 13.... When asked to repeat a second
time does the exact same thing.  Unable to register even 1 of 3
objects.  Is able to register my name, but when asked to produce
it ~3 minutes later, pauses, and then names a friend of his, who
he states looks like me.  Has difficulty describing the events
of
his recent hospitalization, but is able to provide appropriate
history prior to his illness (information about his life in
[**Location (un) 7188**], his sister's family and his nephew, all confirmed by
his
sister).

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk.  Keeps right eye squinted shut.
Able to grossly count fingers in all quadrants with the left
eye,
and will look towards a moving finger in all fields, though will
not fully cooperate with more formal testing.
III, IV, VI: Will track objects to the right without difficulty,
though takes significant prompting, including a $5 [**Doctor First Name **] to look
over to the left, and even then does not fully bury the sclera
of
the left eye.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: Left sided facial droop, and right eye slightly squinted at
rest, though can open it volitionally.  Intermittent twitching
of
the right check
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Will not fully open mouth to assess palate.
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: 5/5 strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Significant paratonia throughout, with limited
cooperation for testing all muscle groups.  When attempts are
made to assess for pronator drift, holds both arms up over his
head, and will not allow them to be repositioned.

Plantar response was flexor bilaterally.

-Coordination: Poor cooperation with attempts at FNF.
Eventually
able to coerce him into giving 'high 5' on either side with no
clear dysmetria.  Also able to reach his toe to my hand on
either
side with no dysmetria.

-Gait: Deferred given significant confusion, poor cooperation
and
impulsivity, with concern for fall risk.
