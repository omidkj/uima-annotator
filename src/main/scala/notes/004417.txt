Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6114**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
right internal jugular line
EGD
Colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
55 year old male with a history of rectal cancer s/p polypectomy
'[**41**], EtOH use with history of DTs/seizures, type 1 DM and
depression who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2148-4-26**] s/p fall at
home. The patient lives alone at home and was brought in by his
daughter, an [**Name (NI) 9168**], who received a phone call from her father on
[**4-26**] after he experienced an unwitnessed fall at home
(?syncope). Patient was orthostatic hypotensive (SBP110>>90
sitting unable to stand) at home. He appeared incoherent on the
phone but complained of stomach aches/vomitting with no
fevers/chills over the past 7 days. He also expressed that he
had not taken his insulin for 3 weeks (reasons unclear). [**Name2 (NI) **]
denied any EtOH in the past 10 days and his urine toxicology
screen at [**Hospital3 **] was negative, although the pt is a poor
historian.
-
In the ED at [**Hospital3 **], he was found to have a BS of 397 with a
gap of 39 and an ABG of 7.02/15/95/95%. His UA was positive for
glucose as well as ketones and bilirubin. In addition, his LFTS
were mildly elevated at: ALP 183, ALT 97, AST 145. His
chemistries were: Na 127/ K 4.2/ Cl 183/ HCO3 4.2/ BUN/Cr 32/1.8

-
His CKs, troponins were flat without EKG changes. He had a WBC
of 11.75, Hct of 31.6 and Plt 64. His Hct in [**12-12**] was 43.
-
His CXR on admission showed question of left lower lobe
infiltrate and he was started on CTX/Azithro in the ED. This was
changed to Flagyl/Unasyn in the ICU.
-
Overnight on [**4-26**] to [**4-27**], the patient had a witnessed seizure
likely attributed to EtOH withdrawal in which he became
incontinent of urine with post-ictal confusion for which he
received Ativan. He did not have any repeat seizures.
-
In addition, he has been having guaiac positive stool but no
melena/hematemesis with a Hct drop from 31.6 to 22 for which he
was transfused 2 units PRBC on [**2148-4-27**] (last Hct before transfer
was 25 at 4pm). His SBP dropped from 100s to mid 60-low 70s and
a central line was placed on [**2148-4-27**] and he was resuscitated
with fluids alone to the 100s without pressors. He also had
received at least 6 liters IVF.
-
Furthermore, on [**2148-4-27**], the patient desaturated to the 80s on 6
liters NC which then became mid 90s on 100% FM. They attempted
BIPAP but failed as the patient has a history of ?obstructed
airway. They believe his respiratory distress was secondary to
volume overload as corroborated with CXR and intubated the
patient on [**4-27**] at 5:30pm. His vent settings on transfer are AC
500 x 15, FiO2=0.5, PEEP=5.
-
His mental status at [**Hospital3 **] on [**4-27**] was somnolent but
arousable as he opens his eyes to voice but not able to provide
a history. At baseline, he is A&Ox3, but difficutly with higher
learning questions.
He was placed on an insulin drip, IV PPI, and is receiving IV
flagyl/unasyn for his bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.

1) Tubes and catheters as described. Note that the sidehole of
the NG tube appears to be in proximity to the GE junction. This
could be advanced several centimeters for better placement.
2) No CHF.
3) Multifocal infiltrates as described.

ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  [**2148-4-29**] 3:04 PM
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other forms
of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on
this study.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2148-4-29**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
probably normal but
the images are not optimal and have limited views of the distal
septum.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably normal
(LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 5.The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
