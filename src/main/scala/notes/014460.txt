Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
Greek-speaking woman with a history of coronary disease,
dementia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease complicated by
gastroesophageal reflux disease and achalasia status post
esophageal Botox injection at the GE junction.  She is living
in [**Hospital3 537**].  She was found in respiratory distress on
the morning of admission with a respiratory rate of 40,
accessory muscle use and oxygen saturation of 92%.  She has
had periodic shortness of breath episodes for the past two
days.  She had a recent ten-day course of Levofloxacin for
upper respiratory tract infection from [**2177-2-27**] to
[**2177-3-8**].  She was brought to the emergency room by EMS and
she received two sublingual nitroglycerin and 40 mg p.o.
Lasix on route.  She was wheezing.  In the emergency room she
received 80 mg IV Lasix and put out 900 urine.  She was also
given two inches of nitropaste.  She was suctioned a lot of
thick, yellow sputum with a concern for aspiration.  Oxygen
saturation increased to 100% on nonrebreather.  She was given
a dose of Levofloxacin.  The first of the cardiac enzymes
were negative and the EKG showed no changes.  Right lower
lobe pneumonia with small pleural effusion was noted on chest
x-ray.  Urinalysis was 30.  After she was diuresed and
suctioned, she had greatly improved breathing with no further
dyspnea.  The respiratory rate decreased and she had great
oxygen saturations on 2 to 3 liters of nasal cannula.  She
was admitted for an aspiration pneumonia/urinary tract
infection.  She had no recent fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, decreased appetite, chest pain, lower extremity
edema.  She noted increased congestion and cough for the past
two weeks.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease with ejection fraction of 40%
seen on echocardiogram in [**2175-5-29**].  She also had
mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.  She has had no recent
angina.
2.  Dementia, mixed multi-infarct dementia and Alzheimer's
disease slowly progressive.
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease on Prilosec.
4.  Achalasia, status post esophageal dilatation with Botox
injections to her GE junction by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] six months ago.
5.  Osteoporosis on calcium and Miacalcin.
6.  Degenerative joint disease.
7.  History of a GI bleed secondary to NSAID use in [**2169**]
requiring a transfusion of eight units of packed red blood
cells.
8.  Status post cholecystectomy.
9.  Status post appendectomy.
10. History of basal-cell carcinoma of the nose.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Prilosec 20 mg q.d.
2.  Miacalcin 1 spray q.d. alternating naris.
3.  Reglan 5 mg b.i.d.
4.  Risperdal 0.25 mg q.h.s.
5.  Calcium 500 mg t.i.d.
6.  Albuterol nebulizer q.4h.p.r.n.
7.  Tylenol 650 mg p.o.q.4h. to 6h.p.r.n.
8.  Multivitamin one q.d.
9.  Dulcolax 10 mg p.o./ p.r.q.d.p.r.n.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**Hospital3 537**].  Her
healthcare proxy is her son.  She is DNR, but not DNI.  There
is no tobacco or drug use.  She has used alcohol in the past,
none now.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is an elderly, frail, thin woman
in no acute distress who is breathing comfortably with a
temperature of 98.1, blood pressure 100/60, pulse 79,
respiratory rate 18 and oxygen saturation 97% on three
liters.  HEENT:  Examination was unremarkable.  LUNGS:  Lungs
were clear except for dullness at the left base.  HEART:
Heart is slightly tachycardiac with a [**3-5**] holosystolic murmur
at the apex.  ABDOMEN:  Benign.  EXTREMITIES:  Without edema
and warm with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Examination revealed the patient to be alert,
interactive, and moving all four extremities spontaneously.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs revealed the white count of 15.6,
hematocrit 41.5, platelet count 483,000, INR of 1.0,
potassium of 2.9, BUN and creatinine of 16 and .6 and a
glucose of 192.  The ABG showed 7.59, pCO2 33, and pO2 of 85.
The urinalysis has many bacteria, 6 to 10 white cells, 3 to 5
epithelial cells.  She ruled out for a MI with negative CKs
and troponins.  She had a calcium of 10 and magnesium of 1.9.
She had negative blood cultures times two and the urine
culture was contaminated with feces.

The EKG showed a wandering pacemaker versus atrial
fibrillation with a left anterior descending artery and left
anterior fascicular block.  She had no acute S-T or T-wave
changes and no significant change from her baseline EKG from
[**2176-3-17**].  Chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe
infiltrate with a right pleural effusion consistent with
right lower lobe pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the floor and
started on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl for a presumed aspiration
pneumonia secondary to recurrence of her esophageal
achalasia.  White count returned to [**Location 213**] with antibiotic
therapy.  She required frequent suctioning.

On hospital day #3, she had acute respiratory distress with
an oxygen saturation to 72%.  She was intubated and sent to
the MICU, where she was suctioned copious amounts of sputum.
The cause of her hypoxic respiratory failure was through to
be secondary to mucous plugging.  She was easily extubated
the following day.  After extubation, she had a brief episode
of hypoxia, lasting seconds to minutes, again that improved
after suctioning.

The next day, she underwent EGD, which showed esophagus with
severe dilation of the middle third and lower third.  She had
relative narrowing at the GE junction.  The stomach had
erythema and erosion in the antrum compatible with gastritis.
1 cc injections of Botox were applied to her GE junction with
successful sphincter relaxation.  She was then transferred to
the medical floor.  She continued to do well with excellent
oxygen saturations on room air.  She was afebrile.  She
required less frequent suctioning.  A speech and swallow
evaluation was done, which showed no signs of aspiration.
She was started on solid foods.  She frequently refused to
eat throughout her hospital stay, perhaps, because of
confusion and being in unfamiliar settings and slightly
frightened.  Her son came to visit and he was able to coax
her to eat a canister and one half of yogurt, which she did
without signs of aspiration, which she tolerated well.  She
did note that she was hungry.  Discussion was had with her
son, who is her proxy who stated that PEG tube would not be
something that she would have wanted.  She completed a course
of Ceftriaxone and Flagyl for an aspiration pneumonia with
improvement in her chest x-ray and clinical status.  She was
discharged home to [**Hospital3 537**] on a mechanical-soft diet to
followup with her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1266**] and
with gastroenterology, namely, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**].
