Admission Date:  [**2182-8-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2182-9-3**]

Date of Birth:   [**2123-9-13**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiac  Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old gentleman
who presents with a 2-week to 3-week history of substernal
chest pain on exertion associated with shortness of breath.
The patient has no significant cardiac risk factors except
for obesity.  He has been in relatively good health.  A few
weeks prior to admission he began having dyspnea on exertion.
This has gotten progressively worse over the last week such
that he can only walk approximately one block without
becoming short of breath.  He is also now experiencing
substernal chest pain radiating down his left arm.

On [**8-27**], he had exercise tolerance test that was
positive but refused admission.  On [**8-29**], he had a
cardiac catheterization that demonstrated a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 60%, a 90% stenosis of his left anterior
descending artery, a 90% stenosis of his right coronary
artery, a 90% stenosis of his first obtuse marginal, a 90%
stenosis of his second obtuse marginal.  The patient was
subsequently admitted to the [**Hospital1 188**] for an elective coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history significant for)
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Asthma.
3.  Cervical disk disease.
4.  Status post open cholecystectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Albuterol MDI inhaler 2 puffs
q.4h. p.r.n.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile
with a heart rate of 82, a blood pressure of 140/60, and a
respiratory rate of 18.  He was in no acute distress.  He was
alert and oriented times three.  His neck was supple.  He had
no bruits.  His lungs were clear.  His heart had a regular
rate and rhythm, and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the
base.  He had normal S1 and S2, and no rubs.  His belly was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  His was obese with normal
active bowel sounds.  His extremities were warm and well
perfused without edema.  His posterior tibialis had a 1+
pulse.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted on [**8-29**],
and on [**8-30**], he underwent an uncomplicated coronary
artery bypass graft times four with the left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending artery, a saphenous
vein graft to the first obtuse marginal branch, a saphenous
vein graft to the second obtuse marginal branch, and a
saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable and
intubated condition.

The patient was extubated overnight.  His Swan-Ganz catheter
was discontinued, and he was taken off of his cardiac drips.
He was started on Lopressor and Lasix.  His diet was advanced
as tolerated, and he was transferred to the floor with his
Foley and chest tubes in place.

On postoperative day two, the patient's Lopressor was
increased to 50 mg b.i.d.   His mediastinal chest tubes had
minimal output and they were subsequently removed.  The
patient was requiring respiratory therapy treatment with
nebulizers for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

On postoperative day three, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable, tolerating p.o., and making good
urine.  His pain was well controlled on p.o. pain
medications.  His remaining chest tube was removed, as was
his Foley catheter.  He was continued on his Lopressor.  The
patient has a history of dysphagia, and a barium swallow was
ordered for the purpose of assessing the etiology of his
symptoms.  The study revealed a distal esophageal narrowing
that was smooth and tapered, suspicious for achalasia.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the Gastrointestinal Service was contact[**Name (NI) **]
and told of the patient's history and the results of his
barium swallow.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had agreed to follow up with the
patient in the [**Hospital 6283**] Clinic in two to three weeks
after discharge, this was conveyed to the patient along with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36115**] office phone number.

On postoperative day three, the patient was still doing well;
however, he was not able to ambulate adequately.  Physical
Therapy continued to see the patient and by postoperative day
four, he was walking 500 feet and able to climb a flight of
stairs without hemodynamic instability.  The patient was
therefore deemed appropriate for discharge to home without
services.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  He had a temperature
of 98.4, heart rate of 88, blood pressure of 126/62,
respiratory rate of 20, oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.
He was in no acute distress.  His neck was supple with no
bruits or masses.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  His sternum was stable, clean, dry, and intact.
His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  He had a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur at the base.  His belly was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  He was obese with normal active
bowel sounds.  His extremities were warm and well perfused
without edema.  His incisions were clean, dry, and intact.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. times one week.
3.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. times one week.
4.  Motrin 400 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h. p.r.n. for pain.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   To home.
