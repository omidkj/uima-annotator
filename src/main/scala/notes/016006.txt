Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
B/L LE edema and non healing ulcers, now awaiting ICD placement
by EP

1. Ultrasound-guided puncture of right common femoral artery.
2. Contralateral second-order catheterization of the left common
femoral artery.
3. Abdominal aortogram.
4. Serial arteriogram of the left lower extremity.
5. Right second toe amputation, open.
6. Left fourth toe amputation, open.

8. single chamber ICD implantation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo male with known long standing DM II, and
chronic non-healing ulcers of the LE's bilaterally.  Patient has
several ulcers of the anterior tibias, calves and dorsum of the
feet. Patient states that he recently had an open aortic valve
replacement at [**Hospital6 **] in [**2174-7-29**]
(porcine).  After this, he was sent to a cardiac rehab where he
was noted to have worsening LE edema and ulcers of the calves
and shins.  These were debrided and UNABOOTS were applied to the
legs.  On removal of the unaboots, there was worsening of the
ulcerations and the toes became more discolored. He has a
history of PVD, and underwent LLE angiogram with Left AT
angioplasty in [**2172**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He most recent NIVS showed
B/L tibial disease.  On the day of admission, he came from wound
care clinic where his affected toes
were noted to be black and bleeding and he was admitted to the
vascular service.
.
While on the vascular service he was felt to have non healing
ulcers, necrotic toes and likely venous insufficency. He was
started on vanco, cipro, and flagyl. He underwent angiography on
[**2-24**] which revealed severe PVD and bilateral lower extremity
ischemia with gangrene.  The decision was made to observe for
improvement while on antibiotics.
.
Patient had a witnessed syncopal episode and was found to be
immediately non-responsive, pulseless.  A cold Blue was called.
CPR was initiated. Initial rhythm strip in code showed V. Fib
and patient was shocked x1. Received 1 dose epi, and 2 grams
magnesium for prolonged QT and possible torsades. Patient was
intubated for airway protection and to allow for vascular access
to be obtained as he was agitated. Femoral line was placed.
Initial ECG post-code showed no ST/T changes c/w ischemia.
Patient was transferred to ICU for management.
.
EP was consulted and felt that his arrest was most likely
secondary to underlying familial prolonged QT syndrome in
setting of fluoroquinolone use, so ciprofloxacin was stopped.
His antibiotic regimen was changed to vancomycin and meropenem.
There were no deep tissue cultures to tailor therapy but tissue
swabs grew diptheroids, citrobacter, staph, bacteroides.  A
urine culture from a foley also grew citrobacter. He was rapidly
extubated without difficulty. Cardiac markers remained negative.
Was initially bradycardic after resuscitation, although this
normalized with discontinuation of propofol sedation and
extubation.
.
His lower extremities did not improve substantially on
antibiotics and he underwent right second toe amputation and
left fourth toe amputation on [**3-2**].  He also had debridement of
bilateral venous stasis ulcerations. He was eventually called
out of the ICU and had an ICD placed on [**3-6**].  He was then
transferred to the medicine service.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**3-7**]: Since [**2175-3-2**], a left-sided single chamber
pacemaker defibrillator was installed ending in the right
ventricle. Sternotomy for AVR was performed.  Moderate pleural
effusion and cardiomegaly persist. Volume overload also
persists.
Note that both bases were excluded on the frontal view. The
technique is
suboptimal, and it is hard to exclude a small right
pneumothorax. Repeat
chest x-ray is recommended if of clinical concern.
.
[**2-24**] ECHO:
The atria are markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis
is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated,
with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is mild mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a small circumferential pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with mild systolic
dysfunction. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional systolic function.
Normally-functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Elevated right atrial pressure.
.
[**2-23**] foot XR:
IMPRESSION: Marked soft tissue swelling particularly of the left
foot and
ankle. There has been a progression of the erosive arthropathy
at the second proximal interphalangeal joint. Neither foot
demonstrates findings suggestive of osteomyelitis.

   WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2175-2-27**]):
      Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup
is
      performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep. are
reported if
      present. Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa
and
      S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..
      CORYNEBACTERIUM SPECIES (DIPHTHEROIDS).    MODERATE
GROWTH.
      CITROBACTER KOSERI.    MODERATE GROWTH.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
