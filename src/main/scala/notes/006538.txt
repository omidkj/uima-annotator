<I>History of Present Illness:</I>
49M DM2, DVT, h/o large L MCA CVA on [**9-18**], returns from rehab
following witnessed ?seizure and hypoxia.
<BR>
Per EMS records, patient was found slumped on right side and
unresponsive, with foaming at mouth. Per report, sats recorded
at 77% with labored breathing. When EMS arrived, patient found
alert, with baseline aphasia. Vitals on field BP 90/50, HR 120,
RR 18, Sat 96% on unknown amount of O2.  Per rehab notes,
patient with low-grade fever on [**9-23**], pancultured, CXR with
bibasilar atelectasis.
<BR>
In ED, patient noted to be hypotensive to 80s, O2 Sats in 80s
(improved w/ NRB), EKG notable for sinus tach.  Pt given broad
spectrum abx (vanco/levo/flagyl) for concern of sepsis, 1 gram
dilantin load, 7L NS.  Given concern for seizure as well as PE,
patient underwent head CT (no contrast), CTA chest, which
revealed midline shift w/ mild uncal herniation and massive
saddle PE.
<BR>
In discussion with neurology team, it was felt that cerebral
changes were expected finding from large MCA stroke, and that
given length of time since stroke (>7days), patient could be
safely anticoagulated.  Given cardiogenic shock, patient was
started on levophed w/ good effect, and taken to cath lab for
emergent thrombectomy.

CTA [**9-25**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Saddle pulmonary embolus with extension into numerous
segmental and subsegmental branches bilaterally.
2. Enlarged right sided mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
........
CT Head W/O contrast [**9-25**]

IMPRESSION: Further evolution with edema involving the large
left-sided middle cerebral artery distribution infarction. There
is mild mass effect with rightward subfalcine and uncal
herniation. No intracranial hemorrhage is identified
.......
B/L LE vein U/S [**9-26**]
IMPRESSION: Positive study with intraluminal thrombus
demonstrated within the right upper superficial femoral vein
extending into the right popliteal vein.
.......
ECHO [**9-26**]
Conclusions:
The left ventricle is not well seen. LV systolic function
appears depressed.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function
appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. Tricuspid regurgitation is present
but cannot be
quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review)
of [**2151-9-21**], the right ventricle now appears dilated
and
hypocontractile.
............
ECHO [**9-27**]
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement. Dilated
ascending aorta.
Normal estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2151-9-26**], the
right
ventricular cavity is slightly smaller.


Brief Hospital Course:
* Massive PE: Mr. [**Known lastname 62419**] was admitted initially to the MICU
and underwent a thrombectomy for a large saddle pulmonary
embolus noted on CT imaging.  On follow up lower extremity
ultrasound he was also noted to have Positive an intraluminal
thrombus demonstrated within the right upper superficial femoral
vein extending into the right popliteal vein. His previosu
echocardiagram were also reviewed and showed no evidence of a
PFO or ASD. He subsequently received an IVC filter.  Having
developed HIT with a positive antibody, he was anticoagulated
with argatroban.  He platelets were monitored and when they
surpassed 100,000, coumadin therapy was initiated.  He was
started on 5mg warfarin QD for 2 days, then subsequently
increased to 7.5mg warfarin.  His INR became therapeutic after
Day 3 of warfarin with an INR of 4.4. His argatrabon was
discontinued and his PTT was assessed three hours after
discontinuation. His INR became subtherapeutic and he was
restarted on argatroban, and was started on 10mg coumadin. The
desired INR range was between [**4-14**] while on argatroban and his
INR increased 5.7 the day prior to discharge. On the day of
discharge his INR was 15.5, the argatroban was discontinued, and
1.25mg of vitamin k was administered, an immediate INR taken had
decreased to 3.1 while off argatroban. Just prior to discharge a
repeat INR indicated 7.6.  He was instructed to hold his
coumadin 7.5mg for the evening, and start taking his 7.5mg
coumadin qhs with daily INR monitoring and adjustment per
physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 7219**].

* HIT: The patient had been receiving subcutaneous heparin at
rehabilitation and arrived in a thrombotic state with decreasing
platelets.  His antibodies HIT ab ultimately were positive.  He
was started on argatroban and all heparin products were
discontinued.  His platelets were monitored for transfusion if
below 10,000.
He did not require transfusions of platelets.

* Fever/White count: He was afebrile on admission.  He had
previously had a low grade temperature while at [**Hospital1 12004**] was being treated with levaquin on admission. He
had an normal white count, and was pan cultured, no infectious
source was found on blood, urine cultures.  No pneumonia was
seen on CTA.  His low grade temperatures were likely secondary
to his pulmonary embolism.  His central line was removed after
stabilization of the patient and transfer to the medical floors,
and a peripheral line was placed. The line tip was cultured with
growth of staph coag negative, likely contamination as the
patient had no clinical signs of infection.

* Hypercoagulopathy:  The patient was hypercoagulable in setting
of heparin, with HIT ab positive.  However, he had a DVT on
coumadin and has not had a full hypercoagulabe workup.  An IVC
filter in place, Protein C was normal and Protein S was slightly
elevated at time of discharge, a further hypercoaguable workup
was deferred until outpatient as laboratory values not
meaningful in acute period

* DM2: His sugars were controlled with a insulin sliding scale.
His sugars were consistently elevated to the 300-400s.  He was
started on Glipizide XL and his glargine was increased for
stricter control.  His sugars were
