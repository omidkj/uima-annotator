Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4588**]
Chief Complaint:
congestive heart failure exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]M with a medical history of systolic heart
failure (EF 30%), complete heart block s/sp PPM, chronic renal
insufficiency (basline cr 1.5-1.8) presents with worsening lower
extremity edema and confusion. Recently discharged on [**2167-8-14**] for
acute on chronic systolic heart failure. Was back to baseline
mental status at home (oriented at baseline although
occasionally forgets location) on PO lasix regimen maintaining
weight of 159. Then over the past week started to gain weight,
become progressively more short of breath at rest, not sleeping
much [**3-10**] to shortness of breath and becoming progressively more
confused. Lasix has been uptitrated from 60/40AM/PM to 120BID.
Had been on beta blocker but that has been held likely due to
asymptomatic bradycardia. ROS notable for orthopnea. [**Doctor First Name **] chest
pressure, fever.
.
He was recently admitted in early [**Month (only) 205**] with progressive SOB,
malaise, confusion and worsening LE edema. At that time he was
initially on a lasix gtt on the floor but required ICU transfer
for worsening mental status thought [**3-10**] hypercarbia, requiring
BIPAP for <12 hours.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.3 35 129/67 33 92. She initially
triggered for bradycardia (30s) but EKG showed paced rhythm,
rate of 60. Labs notable for creatinine of 2.5, troponin of
0.13, BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 16837**] (last admission [**Numeric Identifier 2686**]). ABG: 7.38/64/77/39.
UA and culture drawn. He was given lasix 80mg IV. Started on
CPAP with possible improvement in mental status. 1 18G for
access. Vitals on transfer: 58  127/60 30 100% CPAP.
.
On the MICU, patient taken off CPAP and placed on 2L NC. No
complaints. Put out 500cc in 2hrs to 80IV lasix given in ED.
.
He was transferred to the floor after 1 night. While he looked
ill in the MICU that morning, he improved greatly throughout the
day, receiving another 80mg IV lasix with good UO, and per the
MICU team lookedlike a whole new person.  Cr improved to 2.2
from 2.5 with diuresis.

Microbiology:

Blood cultures from [**9-12**] and [**9-13**]: still pending at time of
discharge

Ucx from [**9-10**]: MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES),
CONSISTENT WITH FECAL CONTAMINATION.

ucx from [**9-13**]: <10,000 organisms/ml

Imaging:

CXR [**9-10**]:  Lung volumes are low. Cardiomegaly is stable.
Mediastinal contours are also stable. There are bilateral
pleural effusions as well as pulmonary edema and bibasilar
opacities, which are nonspecific, though likely atelectatic.

CXR [**9-13**]: no interval change

Echo [**9-11**]:The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with mid to distal left ventricular near akinesis. There is an
apical left ventricular aneurysm. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [In the setting of at least
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]M with a medical history of systolic heart failure (EF 30%),
complete heart block s/sp PPM, chronic renal insufficiency
(basline cr 1.5-1.8) presents with acute on chronic systolic
heart failure and acute on chronic renal failure.

# ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: The patient was
admitted to the MICU (given need for BiPAP in ED) with clinical,
lab (elevated BNP compared to prior), and radiographic evidence
of volume overload consistent with decompensated heart failure.
He diuresed well with IV lasix boluses and was transferred to
the floor given improved respiratory and mental status. His
lasix was increased to 120mg PO BID. Of note he can be given IV
lasix if he refuses his PO lasix while his acute CHF is
continuing to resolve. Please note that we would recommend
starting a low dose of carvedilol (suggest 6.25mg daily) once
his current episode of acute CHF resolves.

# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status with
reduced orientation and inattention consistent with delirium.
Brief episodes of mild agitation including concerns that
hospital staff were not acting in his best interests and holding
him against his w
