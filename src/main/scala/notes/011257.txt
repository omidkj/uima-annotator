Pertinent Results:
cath report [**2160-4-7**]:

to the ipsilateral ACA and MCA.
Stented RCCA.

Echo [**2161-4-6**]:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely
depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
dyskinesis of
the vbase of the inferior and inferolateral walls with akinesis
of the septum,
mid and apical inferior andmid and apical inferolateral walls.
The lateral and
anterior walls are not well seen but probably hypokinetic.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly
dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation
is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-25**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review)
of [**2160-9-30**], the inferior and inferolateral walls are now
dyskinetic. The
inferior and inferoalteral walls are akinetic almost right down
to the very
apex, involveing more terrritory ( by report) than previous.


Brief Hospital Course:
82yo [**Date Range 595**] speaking gentleman with PMH of hypertension, CAD,
CABG, bilateral CEA, CHF, anemia, CRI, AF.

1. R carotid stenosis: MRI/MRA demonstrated R carotid [**Last Name (un) 93591**]
stenosis and high grade CCA/ICA stenosis on R (more likely
atherosclerosis rather than dissection). Pt was taken to the
cath lab and stented.  He spent 1 night in the CCU for intensive
blood pressure control, including a nitroprusside drip.  He was
then transferred to the floor, where his blood pressure was kept
between 100-140 systolic and he had unchanged neuro exam.
During the hospitalization he had no focal neuro findings, and
is discharged back to rehab.
*
2. Abd pain: Pt c/o of some mild abd pain initially, with good
response to aggressive bowel regimen and simethicone.
*
3. CAD: All cardiac meds  were continued.
*
4. +UA: Positive WBC on UA. Pt started on Levo, which he should
take for total 7 days.
*
5. CHF: EF 25-30% according to Echo (see report). Discharged on
listed CHF meds.
*
6. Thrombocytopenia: Pt appears to have Plt between 87 - 123,
with values as low as 13-22 in [**2-27**]. His Plt count was stably
depressed throughout, and workup for myelodysplastic syndrome or
myelodysplasia could be considered as an outpatient as the
patient was also noted to have low WBC.
