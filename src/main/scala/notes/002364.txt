fall.

Alcohol withdrawal.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
male with past medical history significant for EtOH abuse and
parotid tumor status post surgery, who was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] after a fall.  The
patient had been drinking wine and had an unwitnessed fall.
The patient was found at the base of 14 stairs on a tile
floor with unknown loss of consciousness.  Patient complained
of right elbow pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Parotid tumor.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Parotid surgery.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Amitriptyline.
2. Serax.
3. Librium.


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile,
heart rate in the 100s, blood pressure is in the 120s/90s.
He was saturating 100 percent on room air.  GCS of 14.  His
head was atraumatic.  He had no facial deformities.  His neck
had a C collar in place.  There was no tracheal shift.  There
were no step-offs.  His heart was regular.  His lungs were
clear.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  His
rectal has normal tone, is guaiac negative.  His extremities
had no deformities.  He was tender over his right elbow.  He
had a right hand abrasion.  His back was nontender, no step-
offs and no deformities.  Motor [**4-29**] grossly intact in all
four extremities.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit of 41.3.  He had a
sodium of 150.  His creatinine was normal at 0.7.  His INR
was 0.9.

X-RAYS:  His CT of his head revealed small amount of subdural
blood with a small amount of subarachnoid blood.  There were
no bony abnormalities.  There was no midline shift.

CT of the C spine was negative.  CT of his abdomen and pelvis
is negative.

His TLS films:  There was a question of L5-S1 anterolisthesis
old versus new.  His right humerus film was negative.  His
right wrist film was negative.

Chest x-ray was negative as was his pelvis x-ray.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2201-5-2**] to the
Intensive Care Unit for q1h neurologic checks.  He was seen
in consultation by Neurosurgery, who recommended a MRI of his
brain with gadolinium on hospital day one to assess for bleed
versus meningeoma.  They also recommended a MRI of his spine
given the abnormalities on his TLS film.

The patient's original ICU course was significant for
tachycardia, which was thought to be secondary to DT's.  This
was treated with a CIWA protocol.  The patient also required
intubation for his MRI given his severe agitation and
inability to remain still.  The patient went for his MRI,
which revealed likely old L5-S1 anterolisthesis and
spondylosis.  The MRI of his C spine was negative as well.
His C collar was removed and his TLS was cleared.

The patient was extubated.  He continued to do well, and was
transferred on the floor.  On the floor, he continued to have
significant confusion.  He was seen in consultation by the
Neurology team, and they felt that maybe he was withdrawing
from his Ativan, and therefore his Ativan dose was increased.
He also had some respiratory issues including a bout of
stridor as well as low sats.  His chest x-ray did show a
question of a right lower lobe infiltrate versus atelectasis,
however, his ABGs were normal and the patient continued to
saturate well.  He was treated with Decadron and racemic epi
for his stridor, which improved and his nasogastric tube was
removed, which had been giving him tube feeds.

The patient did improve somewhat, however, on [**2201-5-16**], the
patient was found in his room with a heart rate in the 30s,
unresponsive.  A code was called and the patient was
resuscitated.  He was intubated and transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit, where a central venous line was placed
and he was resuscitated for a low CVP.

Also of significance, the patient did have a urine culture,
which is positive for Staph and Enterococci as well as one
positive blood culture.  Originally these were both treated
with vancomycin, however, when they came sensitive to
Levaquin, his antibiotics were changed.

His ICU course was significant for the fact that the patient
self extubated on [**2201-5-18**].  He did well with this, however,
and did not require intubation.  His last day in the unit was
essentially otherwise uneventful.  He continued to improve.
His confusion cleared, and his Ativan was weaned.  He did
undergo a swallow evaluation on [**2201-4-21**], which revealed some
coughing with liquids as well as soft solids, so it was
decided to continue him NPO.

At discharge, the plan is to either continue the TPN and
allow the patient to re-undergo a swallow evaluation at rehab
or to likely place a Dobbhoff versus a PEG for tube feeds.
The patient was seen in consultation by ENT given his small
amount of stridor, and they did not see any anatomic
abnormality, however, they did see some minimal erythema.  It
was felt that the patient should be on Protonix b.i.d. for
likely reflux.  The patient is stable at discharge.

He should follow up with Neurosurgery as well as in the
Trauma Clinic.  We will place the exact follow-up
instructions in the page one.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Ativan 0.5 mg IV q.h.s. prn insomnia.
2. Protonix 40 mg IV q.12h.
3. Lopressor 5 mg IV q.6h.
4. Levofloxacin 500 mg IV q.24h. for a total of 10 days.
   This will end on the [**2-23**]. Regular insulin-sliding scale.
6. Heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d.
