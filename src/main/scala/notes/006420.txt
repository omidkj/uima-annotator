Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5569**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoperitoneum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2122-7-1**]: Exploratory laparotomy with evacuation of hematoma.


History of Present Illness:
43M with alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatitis B who presented to
[**Hospital 4199**] hospital (he was then transferred to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital)
[**6-24**] with acute hepatic failure and pancreatitis (unclear of
severity, lipase recorded as 108).  He then discharged himself
AMA on [**6-27**] and returned on [**6-28**] with acute decompensated liver
failure (MELD 41, INR incr 1.8->3.5), anemia, oliguria/acute
renal failure and suspected sepsis.  He is being transferred
from CH tonight due to hemoperitoneum following paracentesis.
.
The patient reportedly was noted to be more somnolent on [**6-29**]
and underwent paracentesis on [**6-29**] (of note he also had a
paracentesis on [**6-24**]) for 2.5L but no cell counts were sent and a
descriptive report of the fluid was not logged (family reports
fluid was non-bloody).  He therefore underwent repeat
paracentesis this morning and 1L of frank blood was removed. His
hematocrit down trended from 36->24->22, he then received 5U
PRBC and a repeat hematocrit returned 20.5 at [**Hospital1 18**].  He also
recieved 4 units of FFP for an INR of 3.5 (INR on presentation
1.2). NGT lavage performed on arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] was negative.
Patient was intubated this evening due to aggitation for ease of
transport. Blood cultures from CH on [**6-28**] were negative x 4.

Radiologic Studies:
.
[**2122-6-30**] AXR:
IMPRESSION: Multiple air-filled dilated loops of small bowel
without air in the colon is concerning for small bowel
obstruction.
.
[**2122-7-1**] DUPLEX DOP ABD/PEL LIMITED POR; LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US

IMPRESSION:
1. No definite flow is noted within the main portal vein.
2. Ascites.
.
[**2122-7-6**] RUQ Ultrasound
FINDINGS: No focal liver lesion is identified. No biliary
dilatation is seen and the common duct measures 0.4 cm. A large
amount of sludge is seen within the lumen of the gallbladder.
The gallbladder wall is mildly thickened, likely due to
underlying liver disease. The midline structures and kidneys are
obscured from view by overlying bowel. The spleen is
unremarkable measuring 10.2 cm. There is a scant trace of
ascites seen in the abdomen in the perihepatic space. A small
left pleural effusion is noted. DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color
Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images were obtained. The main,
right and left portal veins are all patent and
demonstrate forward flow. Appropriate flow is seen in the
hepatic veins and in the main hepatic artery. The midline
vessels were obscured from view.
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent portal veins.
2. Sludge-filled gallbladder.
3. Scant trace of ascites and small left pleural effusion.
.
[**2122-7-8**] CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast:
TECHNIQUE: Multiple MDCT axial images were obtained from the
base of the neck through the proximal thighs after the
uneventful administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenously.
Multiplanar reformats were derived.
.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The visualized
thyroid enhances homogeneously. There is no axillary,
mediastinal or hilar pathologic lymphadenopathy. The thoracic
aorta and pulmonary arteries appear normal. Heart is normal in
size without pericardial effusion. The esophagus appears normal.
Central airways are patent to the level of subsegmental bronchi.
Ground-glass opacities are seen mainly peripherally with slight
upper lobe preponderance.A more nodular wedge-shaped opacity is
seen on the left. There is atelectasis and superimposed
consolidation in the right lower lobe. In this area, bronchioles
appear ectatic. There is no pleural effusion. There is no
pneumothorax.
.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The liver is
significantly enlarged. There is periportal edema. There is
heterogeneous enhancement of the liver. The gallbladder is
enlarged with an edematous wall. The pancreas appears normal.
The spleen is normal. The left kidney is enlarged in
compensation for the right atrophic kidney. The adrenals appear
normal. Small bowel loops are significantly distended to 4.0 cm.
There is a smooth  long transition point in the proximal ileal
loops proximal to which there is fecalization. Distal ileum is
decompressed. There is no free air within the abdomen. There is
a small amount of fluid adjacent to distal bowel loops on the
right and proximal to the jejunal loops on the left. There is no
pathologic lymphadenopathy in the abdomen. CT OF THE PELVIS WITH
INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Surgical drain is seen entering the left
lower abdominal wall and coursing into the contralateral side to
the anterior surface of the liver. The ascending colon
demonstrates an edematous prominent wall. The bladder appears
normal. The prostate and seminal vesicles appear normal.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no suspicious osteolytic or
os
