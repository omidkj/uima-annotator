CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2134-4-26**] 10:34 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
51 year old man with both chest tubes removed after OR for
empyema [**4-15**]
COMPARISON: [**2134-4-25**].
INDICATION: Empyema. Assess lung expansion and effusions.
There has been slight decrease in degree of volume loss in the
right hemithorax with associated slight improvement in aeration
in the right middle and lower lobes with residual atelectasis
remaining. Loculated right pleural effusion is without
significant change. Minor atelectasis is present at the left
base.
IMPRESSION: Slight improved aeration in the right lung.
Persistent loculated right pleural fluid collection.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

Reason: please attempt drainage and sampling of both of these

Field of view: 40
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
51 year old man with right lower lobe associated abscess and
possible abscess between scapula
INDICATION: Patient with complicated history including recent
thoracotomy for empyema now presenting with two lesions on CT
examination performed yesterday. For sampling of both lesions.
As both samples appeared to be relatively benign, no attempt at
drainage was made.
CONCLUSION:
1. Successful CT-guided aspiration of subscapular lesion.
2. Successful CT-guided aspiration of lung lesion.
3. Improving lung aeration. The attending, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], was
present and assisted throughout.

Chest torso:CONCLUSION:
1. Pleural thickening more prominent along the right chest wall
and superiorly associated with significant atelectasis involving
the right middle and lower lobes and segmental atelectasis of
the right upper lobe. Also identified is a probable
intrapulmonary infarct or abscess within the collapsed right
lower lobe.
2. Two chest tubes in situ. The right chest tube terminates
abutting the second rib. The inferior chest tube lies in an area
of thickened pleura behind the liver. It is difficult to gauge
how much residual fluid is identified.
3. No significant extrapulmonary finding. Incidental note is
made of some fatty atrophy of the ventral pancreas and renal
cysts.




Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo with bipolar d/o transferred from [**Hospital3 5097**] to thoracics
service after difficulty weaning.  S/P right thoracotomy,
decortication at [**Hospital3 5097**] for loculated empyema [**4-15**], s/p right
VATS attempt at RLL wedge [**4-14**] (biopsy for hemoptysis) when
empyema found.
Patient presented [**4-6**] with hemoptysis/cough - started
azithro/ctx; [**4-9**]- bronch/FNA bx - ? BOOP -> d/c'ed home on
cefpodoxime/azithro.
[**4-14**] - represents to OSH with SOB/diarrhea - put on
vanc/unasyn/azithro.
[**4-15**] -To OR for right VATS for eval w/ finding of loculated
empyema drianed,CT to sx.
Culture data results negative:AFB, BAL, wound, chest tissue,
abscess.
[**4-16**] -REturned to OR right thoracotomy -> fibrothorax
[**4-17**] - switched to vanc/zosyn/flagyl
[**4-20**] - Transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] after difficulty with weaning,
improvement s/p surgery.
[**4-21**] - CT shows ? right lung abscess; Pan cultured-awaiting
results of cx; ID following.
[**4-22**] - CT guided drainage of right lung abscess - 5 cc of
serosanguineous- multiple cx sent. Antibiotics and supportive
care cont.
[**4-23**] - extubated, fever curve trending down. Culture data-
negative. PT consulted.
6/3-4 - Supportive care- Physical therapy consulted, looks
improved.  Cx data (fluid, BAL, sputum,tissue, urine)- No
growth, therefore vanc/zosyn d/c and ceftriaxone started.  OOB,
IS, PT, O2 2L 92-93%.
[**4-26**]- VSS, overall improved. O2 93%2L. C.diff- negative x1-
flagyl remains on board as well as po levaquin x 2 additional
days. OOB, ambulating 100 feet w/supervision- activity
toleranced decreased.
[**2134-4-27**] room air sat 93% on room air.
[**4-28**]- Cont improved; flagyl to remain x2 weeks; staples removed-
incision C/D- steri strips in place. Pt stable for discharge.
Sister from [**Name (NI) 614**] coming to [**Name (NI) 86**] by plane to pick-up
