Admission Date:  [**2152-7-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2152-7-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2075-9-2**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT [**Location (un) **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
woman with multiple medical problems who fell in her home on
the day prior to admission.  On admission, [**7-15**], she had an
operative repair of a right wrist fracture and then
postoperatively, was noted to be hypoxic requiring increasing
levels of oxygen.  She had a chest film at the time which
showed a right middle lobe infiltrate, and she was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further
treatment.

In the Intensive Care Unit, she was noted to have increasing
levels of oxygen necessitating intubation, and in addition
her systolic pressure fell into the 70s requiring three
pressors.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Coronary artery disease.
4. Atrial fibrillation.
5. Sick sinus syndrome.
6. History of pulmonary embolism.
7. Nonsmall cell lung status post wedge resection of her
right lower lobe at [**Hospital6 1129**].
8. Rheumatoid arthritis.
9. Depression.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of heavy tobacco
use.  Denies alcohol use.  Lives at home with her husband and
is retired.  She was a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital6 1130**].

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Sotalol.
2. Atenolol.
3. Celexa.
4. Albuterol.
5. Atrovent.
6. Aspirin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was febrile with a blood
pressure of three pressors in the 90s and a heart rate in the
60s with an O2 saturation greater than 90%.  She was a frail
woman looking pale.  Respiratory examination revealed
bilateral crackles in her right base and coarse anteriorly
bilaterally.  Cardiac examination was notable for a 3/6
systolic murmur loudest at the right sternal border.
Abdominal examination:  She has positive bowel sounds, which
is nontender and nondistended.  Extremities were warm with 1+
pulses.

PERTINENT LABORATORY, X-RAY, ELECTROCARDIOGRAM, AND OTHER
TESTS:  She had a white count of 15.1 with a left shift,
hematocrit was 30.7, platelets 322.  Her sodium was 142,
potassium 4.5, chloride 109, bicarb 22, BUN 33, creatinine
1.1, with a glucose of 136.  PT was 21.5, PTT 30.4, INR of
3.1.

She had a chest film taken the day of admission to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit that revealed congestive heart
failure with diffuse interstitial edema and a small right
pleural effusion.  In addition, there were more focal areas
of density in the right upper and lung base consistent with a
pneumonia.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:  The patient was weaned from her three
pressors including dopamine, vasopressin and norepinephrine
by the third day of her Intensive Care Unit stay.  The blood
pressure in the 90s off pressors with continuous infusion of
intravenous fluids.  Several days into admission, she was
noted to go into atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response with a pressure lower into the 80s.  At the time,
she was initially treated with three doses of metoprolol with
no affect.  At that time she was sedated with propofol and
cardioverted.

Subsequent to the cardioversion, the patient was noted to
have pulseless electrical activity, and was resuscitated
according to ACLS guidelines.  One day following the PEA
arrest, she again went into rapid atrial fibrillation and was
treated with diltiazem and left on a diltiazem drip and
digoxin was added to her regimen.  From that time until three
days following, she was noted to be in atrial fibrillation
with adequate blood pressure.  In four days after the second
episode of atrial fibrillation, the patient went back into
sinus rhythm with a paced rhythm.

On the day of her death, on [**7-25**], the patient's blood
pressure had dropped into the 80s despite rigorous
intravenous fluid boluses and rather than continuing to add
pressors to preserve her blood pressure, the family decided
to withdraw support, and the patient died later that day.

2. Respiratory:  Approximately four days following the first
intubation, the patient was extubated without complications,
however, the following day after the PEA arrest, the patient
was reintubated, but the next day, extubated again.  Three
days following second extubation, the patient was noted to
have significant mucus plugging and hypoxemia, and she was
intubated for a third time and remained intubated for the
duration of her hospital course until her death.

3. Renal:  The patient was not noted to have any
complications or problems with her renal function.

4. GI:  The patient was prophylaxed with a proton-pump
inhibitor through a nasogastric tube during the time she was
intubated.

5. Endocrine:  The patient was treated with an
insulin-sliding scale throughout her Intensive Care Unit stay
to improve hyperglycemia.

6. Infectious Disease:  The patient was initially treated
with Flagyl, Levaquin, and Vancomycin on admission to the
Intensive Care Unit.  She was treated and considered as a
hospital acquired pneumonia due to an extensive stay in
hospitals over the previous year.  However, sputum cultures
grew out bacteria that were sensitive to Levaquin, and so
Vancomycin was removed.  Flagyl was kept on the patient's
regimen due to concerns of anaerobic bacteria.  However,
during the patient's second intubation, she developed another
infiltrate on a chest film, and this was treated and
considered as a nosocomial acquired infection and treated
with Vancomycin and Zosyn.  The patient following her third
intubation was kept on the respirator until her death.

7. Neurologic:  The patient was not noted to have any
neurologic problems.

8. Hematologic:  The patient was anticoagulated at home with
warfarin due to her history of pulmonary embolism as well as
a history of chronic atrial fibrillation.  In the Intensive
Care Unit, the patient's Coumadin was stopped, and Heparin
was started, and she remained on weight based heparin
throughout the hospital course.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.
