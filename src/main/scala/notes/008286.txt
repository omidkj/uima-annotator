Admission Date:  [**2104-7-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-8-6**]


Service:  TRAUMA

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year-old woman who
presented initially to the [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2104-7-17**] with right sided costovertebral and
chest pain status post fall.  Chest x-ray revealed multiple
rib fractures, but without evidence of a pneumothorax.  She
was discharged to home.  While at home she experienced an
episode of acute shortness of breath.  She returned to [**Hospital1 1444**] on the day of admission [**2104-7-18**] and found to be hypotensive with a blood pressure in
the 80s and tachypneic.  In the Emergency Department she was
intubated and a chest tube was placed for Pneumothorax.
After placement of the chest tube her pressure returned to
the 120s, but remained labile.  She gives a history of
increased frequency of falls.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
hypertension, bronchitis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Norvasc, Atrovent, Albuterol,
Serevent and Flovent.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Breast cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies use or abuse of tobacco or alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.6.  Blood
pressure 151/66.  Pulse 60.  Respiratory rate 12.  100% on a
ventilator.  GCS of 10. She is awake, alert, intubated and
comfortable.  She is normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light.  Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally with
decreased breath sounds at the right base.  There is a right
chest tube without any evidence of air leak.  Her heart is
regular.  Her abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  She
has a lower midline scar from a previous surgical incision.
Her extremities are warm and without evidence of edema.

RADIOLOGY:  Dedicated films of the ribs revealed right rib
fractures of 8, 9, 10 and 11 and a potential fracture of ribs
7 and 8.  Chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax after chest
tube placement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary:  As previously described
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] initially sustained a pneumothorax, which was
treated with a chest tube.  The chest tube was removed on
hospital day number two.  Follow up x-rays revealed no
persistent pneumothorax.  During her hospitalization she was
given an extubation trial on hospital day number one, which
she failed becoming tachypneic and unable to breath several
minutes after the extubation.  Subsequent extubation trial
was given several days later.  Again she failed this trial
promptly as well.  Her hospital course was marked by much
difficulty managing her pulmonary status.  She had frequent
bronchospastic episodes where she was unable to pass air.
These episodes were treated with multiple bronchodilators
including the use of epinephrine.  Generally these episodes
resulted in the need for increased sedation and increased
reliance on mechanical ventilation.

During this hospitalization after two failed extubation
trials she was found self extubated moments after she had
done this.  Anesthesia was called and after prolonged period
of time an airway was unable to be placed.  Efforts included
direct laryngoscopy using a Bougie and fiberoptic intubation.
 An emergent cricothyroidotomy was performed.  This procedure
was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4468**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 101002**] and assisted by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6644**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 101003**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4427**].  Two days later on [**7-28**]
an elective tracheostomy was performed.

2.  Neurological:  Mrs.[**Known lastname 101004**] pain was initially treated
with rib blocks and ultimately treated with an epidural
catheter.  She was kept comfortable using intermittently
Propofol drips, Dilaudid drips and even benzodiazepines for
comfort.

3.  Cardiovascular:  As was noted in the history of present
illness, Mrs.[**Doctor Last Name 101004**] blood pressure was labile during the
entire hospitalization.  It was felt the use of pain
medication tended to decreases her blood pressure also
requiring the need for vasopressors.  Intermittently the
neo-synephrine and Levophed were used.  The epidural catheter
was eventually discontinued when she became hypotensive.
During this hospitalization she was ruled out for myocardial
infarction.  Management of her volume status and cardiac
status necessitated the need for a pulmonary artery catheter.
Placement of the pulmonary catheter revealed pulmonary
hypertension.  This pulmonary hypertension was felt to be
complicating her pulmonary status.  Consultation with the
pulmonary service was done and it was ultimately recommended
beginning Diltiazem drip.  In order to maintain Mrs. [**Known lastname **]
on a Diltiazem drip Levophed and Dopamine were needed to
maintain her blood pressure.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  During this hospitalization a Dobbhoff
feeding tube was placed.  Tube feeds Respalor were given at a
rate sufficient to maintain her caloric needs.  She was also
placed on Carafate for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.

5.  Infectious disease:  Sputum cultures during this
hospitalization grew out Enterobacter and coag positive
staph.  For this Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was treated with Vancomycin and
Ciprofloxacin.  This was an appropriate regimen based on the
sensitivities of these organisms.  All other blood and urine
cultures remained negative.

6.  Renal:  The initial chest x-ray appeared wet.  Also
during several of her initial desaturation episodes physical
examination revealed crackles.  It was felt as though
decreasing her intravascular volume would help her pulmonary
status.  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was started on a Lasix drip early in
her hospitalization.  Despite being on a Lasix drip her daily
weights continued to increase and she became more total body
water overloaded.  Her intravascular status was managed both
by chest x-ray, clinical examination and pulmonary artery
catheter.  On admission her creatinine was 1.4 and exhibiting
some degree of baseline renal dysfunction.  Creatinine
remained stable until CICU day number thirteen where upon her
creatinine began to slowly rise.  By CICU day number nineteen
her creatinine was 4.7.  She was exhibiting signs of uremia.
The renal service had been consulted and indicated that in
order for Mrs. [**Known lastname **] to recover she would need
hemodialysis.  This offer was presented to the family, which
declined hemodialysis.

Additionally, complicating Mrs.[**Known lastname 101004**] picture was an
initial CT scan of her abdomen obtained in the Emergency
Department revealed bilateral renal masses.  It was felt that
these were most consistent with renal cell carcinoma.  A long
discussion with the family concerning her pulmonary status,
her acute renal failure and the presence of metastatic
disease to decide her further course.

A final family meeting occurred on [**8-5**].  At this point
her pulmonary status, renal status and the possible evidence
of metastatic disease were brought to the family.  The
decision was made to make Mrs. [**Known lastname **] comfort measures only.
At this point she was weaned off her pressors and a morphine
drip was started.  Her ventilatory support was discontinued.











On [**2104-8-6**] Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was pronounced dead by house
officer.
