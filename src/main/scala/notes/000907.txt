Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea; transfer from OSH for possible AV repair

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with known severe AS (valve area 0.5cm^2 in [**10/2134**]) who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for AV repair.  She was
initially admitted to OSH when her daughter noticed her to be
short of breath at home.  The daughter then [**Name2 (NI) 16690**] CPR (rescue
breaths) and called EMS.  At the OSH, she was intially managed
on BiPAP but then reportedly had additional respiratory distress
on hospital day 2 +/- seizure activity.  Shortly thereafter, she
had a PEA arrest, was intubated, and started on norepinephrine
for hypotension.  She was also noted to have positive cardiac
enzymes (Troponin I 16.60, CK 427, MB 50.4, MBI 11.8) at this
time and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization prior to
possible AV repair.

use in past; denies EtOH/drug use.

Family History:

Physical Exam:
T 99.8  BP 90/70  HR 104  RR 12  Sat 100%
Vent: AC with tidal volume 500cc, PEEP 5
Gen: awake, intubated, NAD, following commands
HEENT: +OGT, +ETT
Neck: no carotid bruits, unable to assess JVP
Chest: bibasilar rales half way from bases with mild diffuse
wheezing
CV: IV/VI systolic murmur loudest at RUSB, tachycardic, regular
rhythm
Abd: mildly distended, NT, soft, normal BS
Extr: trace bipedal edema with 1+ PT pulses
Neuro: awake, able to follow verbal commands

Pertinent Results:
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis ([**2135-1-24**]):
Markedly tortuous thoracic and abdominal aorta with an 8-cm
descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.  The aorta becomes normal
in size as it enters the abdomen through the aortic hiatus.
There is moderate-to-severe atherosclerotic calcification of the
thoracic and abdominal aorta, coronary arteries, and branch
vessels of the aorta within the pelvis.  There is
atherosclerotic calcification of the ostium of the celiac axis
and SMA.  6-mm right renal hyperdense lesion, not completely
characterized, comparison with prior studies is recommended.  If
none are available, further evaluation with an ultrasound or MRI
is recommended.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
compressive atelectasis.  Severe degenerative changes of the
thoracic and lumbar spine.
.
TTE ([**2135-1-25**]):
Conclusions:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is severe
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.4cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis. Marked symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic
function. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Moderate
mitral
regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1274**] was intubated at an OSH for acute pulmonary edema in
the setting of a PEA arrest.  Upon arrival, she was intubated
and stable on pressors.  She was easily extubated the next
morning and pressors were gradually weaned off as it became
apparent that her peripheral NIBP was not indicative of her
central BP (presumably due to severe subclavian artery
stenoses).  She was evaluated by CT surgery for possible AV
repair and was deemed to have an unacceptably high estimated
perioperative mortality given the degree of aortic and valvular
calcification, and particularly because of a massive 8cm
thoracic aortic aneurysm noted on chest CT.  Once this was
determined and it was clear that she had a very poor short-term
prognosis due to the severity of her aneurysm, both the patient
and her family agreed that she should be made DNR/DNI.  On the
morning of [**2135-1-27**], she had severe chest pain which required a
nitro drip and morphine drip to become pain free.  ECGs showed
worsened ST depressions in her precordial leads and cardiac
enzymes were consistent with an NSTEMI (peak CK ~1100).  Over
the next 24 hours, she had intermittent bouts of anginal chest
pain and was being evaluated for potential cardiac
catheterization on [**1-28**].  On the morning of [**1-28**], she became
acutely hypertensive, tachycardic, hypoxic, and dyspneic with
diffuse pulmonary wheezes.  She was initally treated with IV
furosemide and metoprolol with minimal improvement.  Her heart
rate acutely slowed and she had several [**1-8**] second asystolic
pauses before becoming spontaneously asystolic and stopped
breathing.  Due to her previously determined DNR/DNI status,
further resuscitative efforts were not pursued and she was
declared deceased at 12:49PM.  The attending notified her
daughter (her HCP) by phone.
