Admission Date:  [**2141-12-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2141-12-28**]


Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
Russian speaking woman, a nursing home resident at [**Hospital3 7511**], who developed acute shortness of breath and had chest
pain.  The patient was treated with Lasix and oxygen and
sublingual Nitroglycerin while at the nursing home and
en route to the hospital via ambulance.

In the [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Room,
the patient was hypertensive with increased work of breathing
and was started on CPAP and was found to have pulmonary
edema.  She had minimal diuresis from Lasix.  The patient was
awake but not alert and not responding and was very agitated,
and a complete history was not possible.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.  Moderate aortic
stenosis with 1 cm2 area of patency in the aorta.  Chronic
renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 4.0-4.2.
Nonsinus ventricular tachycardia.  Dizziness.  Arthritis.
Cataracts.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Nifedipine 120 p.o. b.i.d.,
Meclizine 12.5 twice a day, Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n.,
Isosorbide Mononitrate 60, Lasix 40 q.d., Prilosec 20 q.d.,
Aspirin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission the patient
was afebrile, blood pressure 192/66, heart rate 78,
respirations 36, oxygen saturation 99% on 100% nonrebreather.
General:  The patient was an ill-appearing, elderly woman in
acute respiratory distress using accessory muscles to breath
with forces expiration.  HEENT:  The patient had postsurgical
pupils.  Dry mucous membranes.  The patient had jugular
venous pressure to 10 cm.  Lungs:  Bilateral crackles, left
greater than right.  Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  Soft
heart sounds.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  The patient had 1+ bilateral pitting edema.
Neurological:  The patient was able to follow commands.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus
rhythm, left axis deviation, old Q-waves in V1-V4, II, ST
depressions in V5 and V6.

Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.

White count 23, hematocrit 29.9, platelet count 289; sodium
1.3, potassium 6.3, chloride 98, bicarb 20, BUN 86,
creatinine 4.7, glucose 172; initial troponin was less than
0.3, CKMB 5; blood gas with pH of 7.26, pCO2 48, oxygen 111.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU for
congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.

Course during the admission was marked by increasing renal
failure and multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema in
response to small amounts of fluids.  During one of these
episodes of flash pulmonary edema, the patient complained of
chest pain and had a spike in her troponins that was
interpreted as acute myocardial infarction; however, the
patient was not felt to be a candidate for catheterization
based on discussion with family members.

The patient had multiple episodes of likely cardiac ischemia
during her hospital course which was managed with sublingual
Nitroglycerin, intravenous Nitroglycerin, and hypertensive
medications including Lopressor and Isosorbide Dinitrate.
The patient was noted to have ST changes consistent ischemia
on multiple occasions.

Renal failure continued to worsen with unclear etiology.  The
patient eventually aneuric and was no longer able to be
diuresed to pull off fluid which was compromising her
respiratory function secondary to her congestive heart
failure.

After discussion with the family members, it was agreed that
further medical care and further dialysis to improve the
patient's comfort and breathing would be pursued.  The
patient had a PermCath put in and was taken to dialysis on
[**12-25**].

On [**12-25**], multiple family members including daughter,
granddaughter, and [**Name2 (NI) 14599**] met with the house
staff and reiterated that the patient would remain DNR/DNI
but that hemodialysis would be pursued for the reasons
discussed above.  The patient would also not be eligible for
further central line placement.

The patient was dialyzed for treatment of volume overload and
uremia.  Approximately 2 L of volume were taken off, and the
patient became hypotensive with blood pressure of 60/30.
Approximately 1.2 L of fluid were given back for volume
resuscitation, and the patient's blood pressure recovered.

During this episode, the patient showed ST depressions which
resolved after stopping hemodialysis and getting her fluid
bolus.

The patient was at this point transferred to Medicine from
CCU and treated to keep her blood pressure at a target range
systolic 130-150 and was treated with Lasix which began to
have affect on the night of [**12-26**] showing some return of
renal function with good diuresis over the night of 4th and
during the day of the 5th.

On the day of [**12-27**], the medical attending Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and
house staff met with the patient's daughter, [**Name (NI) 14600**] and
also spoke with the [**Name (NI) 14599**] over the phone, and it
was agreed by all parties that the patient would be COMFORT
MEASURES ONLY at that point and would not receive further
dialysis, and the patient would be evaluated for placement
most likely back at [**Hospital3 2558**] with Hospice Services,
although discussions are still ongoing with final disposition
plan with the family, case managers, as well as the
Palliative Care Team.

During the hospital course, the patient was also found to
have a urinary tract infection with organism isolated as
sensitive E. coli and was treated with Levaquin.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is more mentally alert
than she had been previously during her hospital stay.  She
is recognizing family members and is taking some p.o. fluids.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Acute on chronic renal failure.
5.  Urosepsis with E. coli.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Aortic stenosis.
8.  Nonsinus ventricular tachycardia.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge to [**Hospital3 2558**] is anticipated
on [**12-28**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient will receive the
following medications to treat hypertension with the purpose
of improving her cardiac function and improving her
respiratory function and making the patient more comfortable,
the patient will also receive pain medications as needed and
bowel regimen:

Isosorbide Dinitrate 20 mg 2 tab p.o. t.i.d., Lopressor 75 mg
p.o. b.i.d., Lasix 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Docusate Sodium 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d., ...................., Calcium 8.6 mg tab 2 p.o.
q.h.s., Morphine Sulfate 10 mg/5 ml solution, 1 ml p.o.
p.r.n. for severe pain or shortness of breath, the patient's
blood pressure is very sensitive to Morphine, as well as her
mental status is very sensitive to morphine and therefore
should only be used in case of severe pain or discomfort from
shortness of breath, Acetaminophen 325 mg [**11-23**] tab p.o. q.4-6
hours p.r.n. pain.
