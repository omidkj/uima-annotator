History of Present Illness:
57F with PMH significant for h/o T2DM, s/p renal
transplant [**2122**] on immunosuppressants (Tacrolimus, prednisone
and
azathioprine), who presents to the ED with occipital headache x
2 weeks. She also admitted intermittant blurry vision, which she
attributed to her DM. She had an episode of vomiting the morning
of admission, which prompted her husband to bring her to the [**Name (NI) **].
Initial BP was 250/80 in the ED -> was given 20mg labetolol
which dropped her BP to the 160's. Neurology was consulted, and
witnessed her eyes beating to the left rhythmically, with
eyelids fluttering with the beating nystagmus. She was noted to
be unresponsive to pain or voice during this event, which lasted
for approximately 3 minutes. She was given 2mg IV ativan and the
nystagmus quickly resolved, but her eyes remained fixed to the
left for about a minute, after which her eyes returned to
midline. Her BP during the event was over 200, but after the
ativan it dropped to 170's. FS 174 during the event. She was
noted to be somnolent
afterwards, but within the next 30 - 40 min or so she easily
awakened, would answer some questions and follow commands, but
was very inattentive. She was noted to have a left sided
pronator drift and an inability to raise left leg to gravity.
Non-contrast head CT done before her seizure demonstrated
possible low attenuation within the white matter of the left
occipital lobe and within the right occipital lobe to a lesser
extent. There were also foci of low attenuation within the
subcortical white matter within the right frontal hemisphere. A
second noncontrast head CT was done after the episode that
demonstrated no interval change. An EEG was also done in the ED
and showed showed slowing, no nonconvulsive status per neuro
read. LP demonstrated 1 wbc, prot 47, gluc 97, no oligoclonal
bands.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 36061**] and her husband deny any past h/o seizure, stroke or
infection of the brain. She has had decreased PO intake recently
and had an admission for diarhea and metabolic acidosis
recently. No
fevers, chills, or complaints other than headache per husband.
She takes care of all her medical problems herself and the
husband does not know all the details of her illnesses nor her
meds. She was last seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**4-3**], at which point
her BP was noted to be 180/90, with repeat 160/80. Several med
changes were instituted at that time: Cellcept 500mg [**Hospital1 **] was
switched to azathioprine 100mg qD, epogen decreased from 3 x per
week to 2 x per week due to painful injections, Crestor
restarted at 20mg qD, and
Lasix started at 40mg PO qD for elevated BP.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 36061**] was admitted to the Neuro ICU for hypertensive
emergency, and was monitored overnight, with no events. She was
transferred to the medicine service under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with
neurology consulting for further management.

Bone Scan [**2125-5-7**]:
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of osseous metastatic disease. 2)
Vague left upper quadrant soft tissue uptake. 3) Uptake in both
native right and transplanted RLQ kidneys. Prior left
nephrectomy. 4) Diffuse increase in bilateral leg soft tissue
uptake, may reflect poor renal function or vascular disease.
.
Stress test:
Impression: No anginal symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. Nuclear

report sent seperately.
Mibi
IMPRESSION:
No myocardial perfusion defects identified. LVEF of 58%
.
Abd US:
IMPRESSION: Following extensive evaluation of the left upper
quadrant heterogeneous mass, it is felt that it likely
represents an exophytic hepatic lesion arising from segment II.
Accounting for this, the mass is suspicious for hepatocellular
carcinoma.
.
Liver pool blood study:
IMPRESSION:
Large splenic/perisplenic mass is not consistent with a
cavernous hemangioma or splenule.
.
MRA kidney:
IMPRESSION:
1. Tortuous transplant renal artery with multiple 90-degree
turns with folds giving apparent mild narrowing to the
transplant renal artery. Distal folding gives narrowing that
approaches but is less than 50%. Widely patent anastomosis.
2. Small renal transplant upper pole defect likely from prior
biopsy. No concerning lesion within the transplant kidney or
perirenal fluid collections.
3. Right native renal artery stenosis approaching 50%. Minimal
function remaining in native kidney. Left nephrectomy.
.
MR Abd:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left upper quadrant mass likely splenic in origin, not
completely characterized. While a splenic hemangioma is
statistically most likely, this is uncertain. Comparison with
remote prior films would be best, but if not available, a tagged
red cell nuclear medicine study or biopsy is recommended.
2. Multiple small pancreatic cystic lesions raise the question
of side branch IPMT.
3. Suspicion for proximal right renal artery stenosis in the
native kidney, incompletely evaluated on this study. Transplant
kidney not seen on this study.
4. Cholelithiasis.
.
Renal Transplant US:
IMPRESSION: Diastolic flow is only seen in one branch of the
lower pole of the kidney. Otherwise no diastolic flow is
identified in the upper or mid poles. These findings were
discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4223**] at 5:10 p.m. on [**2125-4-29**].
.
Echo:
Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thicken
