Brief Hospital Course:
39 y/o w/etoh abuse and withdrawal seizures found with coffee
ground emesis and intubated at OSH for airway protection s/p
seizure. Transferred first to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], then to medicine for
continued care.

Active issues:
#Altered mental status requiring intubation: Pt was intubated
for airway protection s/p seizure.  Most likely etiology was
alcohol withdrawal given his hx of withdrawal seizures. Pt was
extubated without complication and mental status improved.  Pt
initially on a CIWA scale. Did not receive any benzos for
greater than 48hr prior to discharge.

#Metabolic alkalosis: Most likely [**3-12**] to vomiting. Resolved with
IVF during ICU stay.

#EtOH withdrawal: CIWA and benzos as above

#Leukocytosis: pt with left shift and consolidations on Chest CT
most likely represents aspiration pneumonitis vs aspiration
pneumonia. Started on vanc/CTX/flagyl in ED and changed to
Unasyn/Azithro in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. to complete 5 day course on [**8-22**].

#Elevated CK to 3000: most likely from immobility and
dehydration. Improved with IV fluids.

#?coffee ground emesis: guaiac positive gastric secretions.
[**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear from history of vomiting is most likely.
Other diagnoses include gastritis and PUD. Hct remained stable
during ICU stay. GI was consulted who recommended PPI [**Hospital1 **], daily
Hct, no further bleeding and thus no EGD performed during
admission.

HTN: pt developed persistent HTN during stay with SBP steady in
150s. As pt with oustide PCP and does not know his name, contact
information or location, poor history of follow up, and no
desire to arrange [**Hospital1 18**] PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] not start medication.
Instructed him to follow up with PCP to start [**Name9 (PRE) **] regimen.
