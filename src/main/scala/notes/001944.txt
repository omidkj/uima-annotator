History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 25368**] [**Known lastname 73102**] is a 68-year-old man with a past medical history of
coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension
and hypercholesterolemia who was admitted for prehydration prior
to cardiac catheterization.

His main complaint is of dyspnea.  He gets moderate dyspnea with
exertion that is readily relieved with rest.  This occurs nearly
every day.  It got somewhat better after starting Lasix.  He
also has thigh pain with exertion that is relieved with sitting
down. This also occurs nearly every day. He denies orthopnea,
PND, leg edema, lightheadedness, syncope, and palpitations.  He
otherwise feels well.  All other systems were reviewed and
negative.

He brought with him his medical records from [**State 4565**].  He had
an anterior myocardial infarction on [**2199-1-13**] that was
complicated by cardiogenic
shock and managed expectantly.  His expectant management was
apparently due to esophageal bleeding (possibly variceal, but no
evident liver disease) that occurred two days prior to this. He
underwent angiography a month later.  There was no report, but
some images are included in his papers.  There is LAD and LCx
disease evident, but the clinical notes only refer to the LCx
disease.  Echocardiograms variously showed LVEFs from 15% to
30%, generally around 20%.  He also underwent a cardiac MR.  The
report is not included in his paperwork, but the clinic notes
describe it as showing an LVEF of 10% with anterior scar.  No
mention is made of viability in the other territories.  He was
considered for an ICD but was apparently turned down.  He was
told that it wasn't worth it for him.

- s/p cauterization, History of ETOH abuse


Social History:
Former smoker, 50 pack year history of tobacco. Former heavy
alcohol abuse, none since [**2198**].  He is a former carpenter and
Marine Corp Veteran. Lives in [**State 4565**] and is here visiting
for the summer. Currently living with his daughter.

Denies premature coronary artery disease.

[**2200-7-18**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system revealed 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent flow limiting lesions.
The LAD had a proximal 70% stenosis and a 60% ostial D1. The
vessel was heavily calcified. The LCX was a heavily calcified
vessel with a 90% ostal lesion and mid vessel stenosis of 70%
into the OM. The RCA was a dominant vessel adn was occluded
proximally and filled via bridging and left to right
collaterals. 2. Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated
left and right sided filling pressures, severe pulmonary
hypertension and a preserved cardiac index. 3. Left
ventriculography was deferred.
[**2200-7-19**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed with global hypokinesis, inferior akinesis
and distal septal, distal anterior and apical akineisi to
dyskinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is  seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 73102**] was admitted under cardiology and underwent cardiac
catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary
artery disease(see result section), along with severe pulmonary
hypertension(PA pressure 75/22 with a mean of 41mmHg). Based
upon the above results, cardiac surgery was consulted and
further evaluation was performed. Echocardiogram was notable for
severely depressed left ventricular function(LVEF of 20%) and
moderate mitral regurgitation. There was only trace aortic
insufficiency with 1-2+ tricuspid regurgitation. Workup
confirmed history of chronic renal insufficiency. His admission
creatinine was 2.0, with mild improvement to 1.6 prior to
surgical intervention. He otherwise remained stable on medical
therapy and was cleared for surgery.

On [**7-21**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting along with mitral valve repair. For surgical details,
please see separate dictated operative note. Postoperative
course was complicated by persistent mitral regurgitation and
bleeding which required re-exploration. Following surgical
intervention, he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated. He slowly weaned from inotropic support and was
eventually transferred to the SDU on postoperative day three. He
He developed hypotension (after receiving a dose of carvedilol)
with atrial fibrillation and was  transferred back to the
intensive care unit on [**2200-7-25**] for pressure support. He was
stabilized and had no further episodes of hypotension and was
subsequently transferred back to the step down unit on [**2200-7-26**].He
was started on Toprol XL (which he has tolerated well), and was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. He has remained stable and
is ready for discharge.
