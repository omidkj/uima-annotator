History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34698**] is a 66 year old man with h/o POEMS syndrome, s/p
autoSCT [**12-15**], therapy-related MDS, recently hospitalized and
diagnosed with recurrence of POEMS syndrome, C1D18 of
Velcade/Dexamethasone, who was admitted with fever and
hypotension.
The patient was discharged 2 days prior to admission ([**2112-6-30**])
after hospitalization for febrile neutropenia, complicated by
ARF requiring HDx4 sessions and features of POEMS syndrome
relapse. At home, the patient had a low grade temp yesterday to
100.3 with chills and then another fever to 101.2 this
afternoon. The wife notes that he was complaining of increased
pain in his lower extremities (neuropathy) and had decreased PO
intake. He became increasingly lethargic and weak to the point
that they had difficulty getting him out of bed. His urine
output decreased from 1100cc the day before to 400cc over 24h.
Foley was in place since last Sunday (1 week). The wife called
the BMT fellow on call, who referred the patient to the ED.
In the field, the patient's BP was 60/40. EMS placed a
peripheral line and bolused him with IVF.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 101.2 HR 120 BP 184/132 RR 18
O2sat 100% NRB. BP then dropped to 50/30 about 10 minutes after
arrival. The patient was lethargic, but arousable to voice,
complaining of generalized body pains. Patient had brown, turbid
urine in his foley. CXR showed persistent L basilar
opacification. Labs notable for HCT 19.5, Plt 8, HCO3 18, Cr
3.7. The patient was started on Levophed, Vanc, and Cefepime.
Also given a dose of Hydrocortisone given recent steroid use.
Given 4L NS. He was intubated in the ED without difficulty using
the Bougie, despite h/o tracheal stenosis, and started on
Fent/Midaz for sedation. On transfer, Levophed was running at
0.42mcg. VS: T 100 HR 119 BP 114/51 RR 18 O2sat 99% on FiO250%
TV450 PEEP4.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS T 98.6 HR 106 BP 127/84 RR
16 O2sat 98% on AC TV 450 RR 18 FiO2 40% PEEP 5. The patient is
intubated and sedated on Fentanyl 100mcg/hr, Midazolam 4mg/hr,
Levophed 0.32mcg/kg/min.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
POEMS syndrome manifested by polycythemia, polyneuropathy,
organomegaly, endocrinopathies including hypocalcemia,
hypothyroidism, hypogonadism and elevated PTH (diagnosed in
[**2099**]). In [**2101**] anasarca that eventually progressed to
respiratory failure, treated with plasmapheresis and prednisone
followed by  18 months of cyclophosphamide.
[**4-/2108**]/[**2108**]: Bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 days 1,4,8,11 and
dexamethasone (20 mg days 1,2,4,5,8,9, 11, and 12) x three
cycles discontinued due to painful lower extremity neuropathy.
[**11/2108**] high dose cytoxan  for stem cell mobilization ([**11/2108**])
[**12/2108**] high dose melphalan with stem cell rescue ([**2108-12-9**])
In remission since than.
[**4-/2112**]: bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed dysplastic
basophilic and polychromatophilic erythroblasts, a marked left
shift and dysplastic myelopoiesis and abundant hyperchromic
megakaryocytes, which initially were felt to be consistent with
colchicine toxicity; however, chromosome studies performed on
that bone marrow material revealed an abnormal karyotype 15/16
studied cells showed a complex clone with the following
anomalies.  He had deletion in the long arm of chromosome 5
between band 5q13 and 5q33, otherwise known as 5q minus.  He had
monosomy 13, monosomy 17, monosomy 20, and addition of an
unidentified marker chromosome and [**2-12**] double minute
chromosomes.  These were all consistent with a myeloid
abnormality since there were not an increased number of blasts
much more consistent with MDS.

OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. POEMS syndrome: First diagnosed in [**2099**] with treatment
described above. His manifestations have been as follows:
A. Polyneuropathy - CIDP in [**2099-6-6**]; Painful lower extremity
sensory neuropathy and proprioception defects.

related to hypoparathyroidism
D. Monoclonal gammopathy
E. Skin and nail changes - now resolving.
F. Pulmonary hypertension and restrictive lung disease.
G. Chronic renal insufficiency (which has now resolved with
therapy)
H. Anasarca, now resolved.
I. Hyperuricemia and gout - now resolved
J. Polycythemia and thrombocythemia - now resolved
2. Vitamin B12 deficiency
3. S/p compound fracture, [**2103-8-7**]
4. S/p tracheostomy [**2101**]
5. prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy
6. gout
7. pulmonary HTN and restrictive lung disease
8. chronic kidney disease
9. C Dif ([**5-/2112**])
10. Acute angle glaucoma ([**2112-4-27**])
