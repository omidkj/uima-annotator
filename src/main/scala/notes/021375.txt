Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2891**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Chest Compressions
Defibrillation
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
81F with Hx of HTN, HLD, paroxysmal afib with RVR,
moderate-severe MR, and dCHF who presents with shortness of
breath. Patient states she woke up this morning with shortness
of breath which she has been experiencing for the past 2 weeks.
She describes it as intermittent and nature and that it comes in
waves lasting about 30 mins in total with near complete
resolution of her symptoms in between episodes. Interestingly,
she denies associated palpitations nor does she endorse chest
pain associated with these episodes but states this feels
similar to when she presented to her PCP 1 week ago when she was
found to be in afib with RVR. Of note, she was admitted here
from [**Date range (1) 1163**] after she presented to her PCP's office with
new-onset palpitations with associated dyspnea found to be in
afib with RVR and diastolic heart failure. She had a TEE which
showed 3+ MR and no intracardiac thrombus and underwent
successful cardioversion with return into NSR, was started on
sotalol, underwent IV diuresis with good success, and was
discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of hearts monitor and outpatient
cardiology follow-up which is scheduled for next week.

In the ED, initial vitals were 98.6, 80, 145/90, 16, 99%2LNC
-Labs: CBC and Chem 7 unremarkable, INR 1.7, trop negative x 1,
BNP 4983
-Imaging: CXR called as CHF, negative R LENI
-Patient given: Lasix 20mg IV x 1
Vitals on transfer were 97.7, 78, 139/79, 20, 96%RA

On arrival to the floor, patient feels much better following
diuresis in the ED. States she has probably gained 5lbs over the
past 2 weeks and that her normal weight is about 155lbs.
Describes orthopnea, PND, and occasional night-time awakening
for urination. Denies chest pain and states that her SOB is with
exertion as well as at rest.

===========

IMAGING/STUDIES:
================
CXR PA/LAT [**6-13**]:
IMPRESSION:  Findings most suggestive of congestive failure
which has progressed since [**2141-6-6**].

Right Lower Extemity Non-Invasive:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right
leg.

TTE [**6-15**] LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). TDI E/e' >15,
suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR. Eccentric AR jet directed toward the anterior
mitral leaflet.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
MVP. Mild mitral annular calcification. Eccentric MR jet. Severe
(4+) MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Due to the eccentric MR jet, its
severity may be underestimated (Coanda effect).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Severe [4+]
TR. Eccentric TR jet. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor suprasternal
views. Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber s
