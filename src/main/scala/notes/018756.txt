Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarhea, Pulmonary Embolism, DVT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
75 year-old female with a history of metastatic adenocarcinoma
of the small bowel (last dose of chemo FOLFOX [**2121-6-17**]) who
presents with abdominal pain/nausea/vomiting/diarrhea
incidentally found to have saddle PE and DVT. The patient was
seen by her oncologist on [**7-11**] for c/o diarrhea in clinic and
was given 1L IVF, given immodium and imaging was deferred given
improvement in symptoms. Over the weekend she states that her
diarrhea improved and did not have any further episodes. She
reports that today she had 2 more episodes of loose stools,
yellowish in color. She also reports SOB and labored breathing.
She called her oncologist's office and they advised her to go to
the ED.

In the ED, VS 97.2, 99/61, HR: 90 RR:16 100% RA. Patient
underwent CT torso that showed saddle PE. The patient underwent
CT-head that did not show brain mets or hemmorhage and was
started on heparin gtt. ED spoke with IR and not candidate for
clot removal at this time. The CT torso also showed abnormal
bowel wall thickening with bowel wall edema involving a long
segment of jejunum. The DDx being likely angioedema in the
setting of chemo, but also possible infectious vs ischemic
(although SMA/[**Female First Name (un) 899**] and SMV are patent). She was given 750mg
levofloxacin and 500mg flagyl. The patient also had an episode
of hypotension thought to be a syncopal episode with SBP
dropping to 50's, but improved to baseline without intervention.


Currently, the patient states that her abdominal pain has
resolved and no further episodes of diarrhea. She denied and SOB
and states that her breathing was comfortable. No history of
travel or recent surgery.

Of note, pt was on levoflox on [**2121-6-30**] by her oncologist for
neutropenia and dysphagia/hoarse voice and also given neulasta.
Her WBC count increased to 54.6, but now trending down.

ROS: + 10lbs weight loss since starting chemo in [**Month (only) 547**]. The
patient denies any fevers, chills, constipation, melena,
hematochezia, chest pain, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema,
cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness,
gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache,
rash or skin changes.

1. Metastatic small bowel adenocarcinoma
2. Osteoporosis
3. Right breast abscess
4. Hysterectomy for fibroids
5. HTN

7. s/p left rotator cuff surgery

Social History:
SOCIAL HISTORY: She used to work as a systems analyst. She is a

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2121-7-14**] 11:31 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Newly developed saddle pulmonary embolism since examination
from [**2121-5-14**].
2. Extensive metastatic disease with multiple subcentimeter
cavitating
pulmonary nodules and hypodense liver lesions.
3. Abnormal bowel wall thickening with bowel wall edema
involving a long
segment of jejunum. There is associated focused mesenteric fluid
adjacent to abnormal loop of small bowel.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2121-7-14**] 12:42 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of obvious masses or hemorrhage. Note that only
post-contrast images are provided and this limits the detection
of subtle areas of hemorrhage or enhancement due to lack of
precontrast images. MRI has a much greater sensitivity for the
detection of intracranial metastasis and can be obtained as
clinically indicated.

2. Stable appearance of sclerotic focus in the right frontal
bone with
nonaggressive features, again differential most likely includes
fibrous
dysplasia; however, in the context of known primary malignancy,
osteosclerotic metastasis is a consideration and can be
correlated with bone scan as indicated. Comparison with any
remote priors may be helpful.

The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
no
