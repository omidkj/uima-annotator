Chief Complaint:
1. Acute mental status changes
2. Emergency HTN

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Resection of brachial artery aneurysm with vein graft repair
of artery
2. Placement of a double lumen 14.5 French tunneled hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
Pt sedated and intubated. Information taken from chart. 52 yo M
with Alport's syndrome, ESRD on HD, renal transplant x 2,
diastolic CHF, HTN who presents with agitation and altered
mental status. He was at hemodialysis today when he became
agitated. HD was stopped midway and he was brought to the ED.
Per the renal attg note, he has been combative through the last
several HD sessions, but this time he was even more so. Per the
note, he was acting intoxicated but did not smell of ETOH.

In the ED, his vitals showed HR in the low 100s and BP
220's/130's. He was given hydral. He was noted to have a very
large aneurysmal AV fistula. Vascular surgery was called. He was
started on an esmolol gtt before coming up to the floor.

Of note, the renal attg note states that he has a hx of cocaine
abuse in the past.

MICU COURSE: HTN emergency with AMS in setting of initial BP
220/130 while at HD appeared confused, combative. Admitted to
MICU, started labetolol gtt, intubated for airway protection,
tox screen negative, head MRI-neg, underwent surgical repair of
RUE fistula aneurysm which was actively expanding w/HTN
emergency, HD catheter placed, extubated Friday. Infection w/u
negative, Walking, mentating as baseline, titrating BP meds,
standing hydral added, toprol, lisinopril Baseline SBP 160s.
While on floor, pt mentating well, denies any complaints, no
HA/Visual changes, no confusion. No CP/Palp, no SOB.
Comfortable. States he's now getting some sensation in his RUE p
surgical repair of expanding fistula aneurysm. He has no further
complaints.

Non-contrast CT of the head.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect, or shift of normally midline structures. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. The ventricles are normal
in size and symmetric. There is moderate cavernous carotid
athersclerotic calcifications. The visualized paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are clear. There is congenital nonfusion
of the C1 vertebral body.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain
were performed. An MR angiogram of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] was also
obtained with 3D time-of-flight images, including reconstruction
of multiplanar maximum intensity projection reconstructions.

MRI OF THE BRAIN: Faint foci of hyperintensity in the vertex
parietal sulci on the FLAIR images show a bilateral symmetric
distribution. These may be artifactual or could be explained by
propofol administration or hyperoxygenation. No signal
abnormalities are demonstrated within the basal cisterns.

There is no mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of the normally
midline structures. A mild extent of scattered punctate foci of
T2 hyperintensity in the deep, subcortical, and periventricular
white matter of the cerebral hemispheres is most suggestive of
chronic small vessel infarcts. However, there is no area of
restricted diffusion to suggest a recent infarct. No
susceptibility artifacts are present.

A small amount of fluid and/or mucosal thickening is present in
the sphenoid sinus, as well as mucosal thickening in the ethmoid
sinuses, an appearance that can be seen in intubation. The
frontal and maxillary sinuses, as well as mastoid air cells are
clear, aside from a tiny area of mucosal thickening along the
medial wall of the left maxillary sinus, likely inflammatory in
origin.

MR ANGIOGRAM: A 4-mm aneurysm is present along the anterior
communicating artery without a well-defined neck. The A1 segment
of the left anterior cerebral artery is small. Blood supply to
each anterior cerebral artery predominantly stems from the right
A1 segment. The right posterior communicating artery is either
very small or absent. There is no evidence of stenosis or
arteriovascular malformation.

IMPRESSION:
1. Evidence of chronic small vessel infarction in the cerebral
white matter, but no evidence of recent infarction,
encephalitis, or other acute intracranial process.

2. Small anterior communicating artery aneurysm of 4 mm in
diameter. Neurosurgical evaluation is recommended. The findings
were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14393**] on [**2189-9-3**].
