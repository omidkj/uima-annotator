Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15519**]
Chief Complaint:
Elevated blood sugars, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central venous catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
84 M russian speaking, h/o CAD, NIDDM, HTN, CKD (baseline cre
~1.3), h/o recurrent aspiration PNA, who presents from home,
after his family noted elevated blood sugars. history obtained
from son, who states pt was feeling well until 3-4d ago, when he
noted increasing LH/dizziness, drowsiness, and a feeling of
"fog" attributed to recent increases in his neurontin dose (for
LE pain [**2-12**] spinal stenosis, dose increased from 100mg tid to
300mg tid then 600mg in AM, 300mg [**Hospital1 **]).

On the morning of admission, son noted that pt had increasing
urinary frequency, which pt stated had been going on for [**2-13**]
weeks. FSBS was 500s, and son activated EMS. Pt had apparently
not been checking FSBS or taking his glypizide x 2-3 weeks.

ROS per son negative for f/c/ns/cp/n/v/abd pain/melena,
hematuria, hemetemesis, rash, joint pains, weight loss.

In ED VS= 99.1 109 140/111 87%RA. pt was coughing, afebrile. Per
report, O2 requirement increased, and pt would not tolerate
CPAP. SBPs intially dropped to 80s/30s prior to intubation,
however recovered with 2-3L IVF. Post intubation, SBPs initially
stable, hwowever then dropped again to 71/49, felt partially [**2-12**]
sedation, unresponsive to IVF (1L more), and pt started on
levophed gtt with improvement in MAPs to >60. L IJ TLC placed,
initial CVPs 7-9. CXR interpreted as RLL PNA. EKG= ?sinus tachy,
lad, lvh, no BBB, STE, or STD. CK (1089, MB 13), troponin (0.07)
elevated. Pt given levoquin 750 x 1. blood sugars in 500s.
lactate 2.5->1.5, AG acidosis=16, K=5.3. decadron for ?sepsis.
UA sent, +ketones.

- h/o aspiration pneumonia.
- h/o gastrojejunostomy tube; status post aspiration pna
(removed) x 1 [**1-12**] yrs to reduce need for oral feeds and prevent
recurrent pneumonia. Tube fell out and was not replaced in
[**2190**] as he had been eating gradually more food and a
trial of oral feeding was chosen. The cause of the aspiration
pneumonia was thought to be disordered swallowing s/p XRT to his
larynx yrs ago in the USSR.

Pertinent Results:

CXR
2. Multiple pulmonary nodules combined with reticular opacity.
Given the absence of this finding on the chest CT from [**Month (only) **]
[**2189**], this might represent infectious process or non-infection
lung inflammation. Precise characterization with chest CT will
be recommended.

[**2190-9-30**] TTE - Normal biventricular function. Normal left
ventricular diastolic function. No significant valvular
abnormality seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 M h/o CAD, PVD, HTN, CKD who presented to ED with DKA and was
intubated for concern for hypoxia and agitation.
.
Hospital course is as outlined below per problem:
.
# Hypoxia - The patient was brought to the ED because of
hyperglycemia, without prior complaint of SOB per his son.  [**Name (NI) **]
was found to have an O2 sat of 87%RA.  His respiratory status
continued to deteriorate on CPAP and non-rebreather so he was
intubated in the ED.  A left IJ was placed and he was started on
levophed for hypotension (MAP 65). He received a dose of
levofloxacin 750mg.  Initial ABG obtained after intubation
showed appropriate oxygenation (7.23/40/242 on 60% AC 600x14,
PEEP 5).  He was ruled out for MI.  He was felt to have a PNA
and was switched to ceftriaxone because of concern over a
prolonged QTc.  He was also started on vancomycin to broaden
coverage, but this was stopped on HD#4.  Sputum cultures
eventually grew step pneumo.  He was extubated on HD#3 without
difficulty.  During his ICU course, he continued to have mild
episodes of respiratory distress thought secondary to mucous
plugging.  He responded well to aggressive chest PT.  Given his
history of aspiration PNA's, it was felt that the patient would
benefit from a PEG, but the patient continuously declined.  The
patient and his family were both made aware that he will
continue to be at risk for further aspiration events.  He
completed a 10 day course of ceftriaxone on [**2190-10-9**].  He was
transferred to the floor where physical therapy evaluated him.
Incentive spirometry was initiated.  He still required
occasional oxygen by nasal cannula overnight due to periodic
desaturations while supine.
.
# Hypotension - The patient was normotensive on admission to ED,
but became hypotensive around the time of intubation.  The
etiology was most likely [**2-12**] dehydration from DKA that was
exacerbated by sedation at time of intubation. SBPs improved
with decreased sedation, the patient require pressors into HD#2
(initially on levaphed, which was switched to dopamine as it was
felt it might be contributing to sinus bradycardia below) but he
was then weaned off and maintained his pressures throughout the
rest of his ICU course.  His home BP medications were restarted
when his pressures stabalized.
.
# Ischemia: In the ED, there was some initial concern for ACS
given an elevated troponin to 0.07, but serial enzymes wer
