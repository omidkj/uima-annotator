Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
vomiting, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 36589**] is an 80yo woman with h/o multiple CVAs, laryngeal
cancer s/p tracheostomy, with GJ tube for failure to thrive and
swallowing dysfunction who presents from rehab after vomiting
tube feeds yesterday, today with temp to 102 and desat to 88%.
Per her daughter she has had chronic diarrhea with C diff
alternately on and off flagyl or vanco, and has had some
abdominal pain at her J tube site since it was placed. Her
baseline status is that she is not indepent of her ADLs, but can
wash her face on her own and last week walked 50 feet wtih two
person assist for the first time in quite a while. She requires
two person assist for everything. Goal of care is for pt to
eventually go home, at this time the family is not thinking with
hospice but rather with home nursing.
.
She was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER where she refused a central
line.  UA was positive, although the patient has a chronic
indwelling foley catheter. Urine, blood and sputum cultures were
sent and the patient was given vanco, levo, and flagyl for
presumed aspiration pneumonia.  CXR showed no evidence of acute
CP process and CT abd/pelvis showed bowel thickening at the
sigmoid-descending colon junction c/w diverticulitis versus c
diff.
.
Notably, the patient's HCP is her husband, who was recently
diagnosed with melanoma and is having surgery tomorrow, so he
cannot sign for her. Her daughter [**Name (NI) **] is her second-in-line
for HCP and she will sign during this stay.  The patient is not
aware of her husband's diagnosis, nor that he is having surgery
tomorrow, as her family does not want to upset her.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is an 80 yo woman with a history of several strokes,
dysphagia s/p GJ tube placement, laryngeal cancer s/p
tracheostomy who presented from rehab after vomiting tube feeds,
temperature as high as 102 and desaturation down to 88%. The pt
was
started on Levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia, in the setting
of an episode of vomiting. She was maintained on an oral
Vancomycin dose given CT evidence of focal wall thickening at
junction of sigmoid and descending colon and the pt's history of
recurrent Cdiff. The pt was also noted to have an Ecoli UTI. [**Name (NI) **]
pt eventually also grew Ecoli in her sputum. Thus her antibiotic
regimen was changed to Bactrim. The pt is scheduled to complete
a 10 day course of Bactrim. The pt's stool cultures were noted
to be negative for Cdiff thus she can be restarted on the opium
tincture on discharge. The [**Hospital **] hospital course was significant
for the following events:
.
HYPOXIA:
The pt was noted to have hypoxia in the setting of likely
aspiration with vomiting.  The pt's hypoxia gradually resolved
with frequent suctioning. She was noted to have an opacification
the left lower lobe which was noted to resolve on a follow-up
x-ray. The pt's CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia, aspiration,
or CHF. The pt was noted to require frequent suctioning,
especially at night and will need to be maintained on Q4H
suctioning to prevent desaturation.
.
FEVER:
The pt was noted to have fever and an elevated white cell count
in the setting of sputum and urine cultures that were positive
for Ecoli (resistant to Levaquin bt sensitive to Bactrim). It is
possible that the pt may have aspirated while vomiting and that
she had a concomitant UTI. The pt's foley was replaced and her
antibiotic regimen was changed to Bactrim DS; she will need to
complete a 14 day course of this antibiotic. Her repeat urine
culture was negative. The pt also had blood cultures drawn in
the ED that will need to be followed up by the physicians at the
rehab as [**Hospital 4171**] results becaome available.
.
DIARRHEA:
The pt was noted to have chronic diarrhea which, per pt's
daughter, is recurrent. The pt underwent a CT abdomen which
showed focal wall thickening at junction of sigmoid and
descending colon. These findings were thought to be consistent
with acute diverticulitis, or possibly colitis given patient's
history of c. diff colitis in past. The pt had been started on
oral Vancomycin for (presumed) Flagyl-resistant Cdifficile.
However, two sets of stool were negative for Cdiff. The pt did
complete her 10 day course of PO Vancomycin while in the
hospital. The pt was started on octreotide and tinctiure of
opium that were held during the hospitalization, given possible
Cdiff and propensity towards toxic megacolon if given
antidiarrheals. .
.
PERIRECTAL YEAST INFECTION:
The pt was noted to have a perirectal yeast infection in [**Hospital 4171**]
setting of frequent soiling seconondary to diarrhea. The pt's
rash was treated with topical clotrimazole cream perirectally. A
rectal tube was place to allow the perirectal area to heal, this
tube should be removed once the pt's diarrhea resolves.
.
HYPERTENSION:
The pt was maintained on her admission dose of Lopressor.
.
HISTORY OF CVAs:
The pt was maintained on her out-pt dose of Coumadin; her goal
INR is [**2-20**]. She will need to have her INR checked daily with
uptitration of her Coumadin dose at the rehab. Of note, the pt
does have a history of GI bleeds while on anticoagulation.
.
HYPOTHYROIDISM:
The pt has a history of hypothyroidism for which she was
maintaintained onher out-patient dose of Synthroid.
.
POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA:
The pt was maintained on her out-patient dose of Prednisone for
PMR.
.
FEN:
Thept was maintained on her outpatient regimen of tube feeds.
Her electrolytes were repleted as needed.
.
PROPHYLAXIS:
The pt was maintained on prophylaxis with a proton pump
inhibitor, SCHeparin and a bowel regimen.
.
CODE STATUS:
DNR/DNI confirmed by daughter, also in notes doc
