History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6632**] is a 84 yo female with history of HTN, HLD, CKD,
known LBBB who presented to [**Hospital3 **] [**7-19**] after waking up
at 2am with sudden onset shortness of breath. Had 2 other
similar episodes that were less intense in the last two weeks.
Per daughter, patient has been less active in the last 6 months,
and especially in the last week. On the night prior to
presentation, she felt warm and was sweating, some chills no
fevers. Previous baseline, pt reports that she is very active,
exercises 30 min daily and walks 1 hr daily.
.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 **] ([**7-19**] 4am), pt initially required BiPAP.
199lbs (90.4kg), 97.6 Temp, WBC = 14.4, 110s-120s/50s-60s, HR
70s-80s, BNP 421, BUN 27, Cr 1.3, TnI < .06, Per their read CXR
right upper and right lower lobe pna with some background edema,
started on ceftrixone, azithro (day 1 [**2125-7-19**]). Admitted to
their ICU for BiPAP. Cards was consulted on [**7-19**] there who
rcommended second set of enzymes. 2nd set of Card enzymes at
[**7-19**] 8am show TroponinI 2.95, no chest pain, EKG showed ? =>
started on Heparin gtt, ASA 325, Plavix 300mg, Deemed not
candidate for cath due to PNA and on ABX and "even patient
refuses"
.

STUDIES:
[**2125-7-23**] ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %). There is
considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. A
left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
severe global hypokinesis. Moderate right ventricular
hypokinesis.
.
[**2125-7-24**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting disease.  The mid LAD
had a long 70% stenosis.  The ramus was irregular with an 80%
stenosis.  The mid LCx had a 50% stenosis.  There was a subtotal
occlusion of the mid RCA.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated right
and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 23 mmHg and
PCWP of 36 mmHg. There was significant pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension with a PASP of 61 mmHg.  The cardiac output and
cardiac index were depressed at 3.38 L/min and 1.85 L/min/m2
respectively.  There was mildly elevated systemic arterial
hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 148/66 mmHg.
3. Successful PCI of the right coronary artery with a 2.5 x 12mm
INTEGRITY OTW bare metal stent.  Final angiography revealed no
residual in-stent stenosis, no angiographically apparent
dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2.  Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
3.  Elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
4.  Depressed cardiac output and cardiac index.
5.  Successful PCI of the right coronary artery with bare metal
stent placement.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 y/o female admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for acutely worsening PND/DOE,
stay complicated by acute onset chest pain with elevated TnI and
chronic LBBB changes. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for potential PCI in
the morning.

# CORONARIES: acute NSTEMI/UA given rise in Troponin after
admission, No prior cath history or cardiac hx, EKG with old
LBBB, sinus. No arrhythmia, chest pain non-refractory, HD
stable, unclear if CHF worsening. Non-emergent cath i
