Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
Pre byass: The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior and anteroseptal
hypokinesis. with mild global rv free wall hypokinesis. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen with
posterior leafelet flail and an anteriorly directed eccentric
jet.

Post Bypass: Patient is on epinepherine, milrinone,
phenylepherine, in atrial fibrillation. A tissue prosthesis is
seen in the mitral position. Initial tiny paravalvular leaks
resolved with protamine. No MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 31228**] 4-9 mm hg, Mean
[**Last Name (Titles) 31228**] 2-5 mm Hg on mitral prosthesis. LV EF 45% RV function
borderline normal. Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is
unchanged. All findings discused with surgeons at the time of
the exam.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission he was diuresed and underwent
catheterization.  There was no significant coronary disease.  An
intraaortic balloon was placed preoperatively and on [**2-13**] he
went to the Operating Room where valve replacement was
performed.  See operative note for details. He weaned from
bypass on epinephrine, Vasopressin,propofol and Milrinone, along
with the intaaortic balloon.

The balloon pump was removed the evening of surgery and he was
extubated on POD 2.  The pressors were weaned off slowly and he
remained stable. He remained in atrial fibrillation with stable
hemodynamics.  CTs remained for many days due to significant
serous drainage and he was diuresed with lasix as well.  He
remained intact albeit very frail. He was not anticoagulated for
his fibrillation (has refused this) and transferred to the floor
on POD 4.  Physical therapy was consulted and worked on mobility
and strength with him. He was thrombocytopenic to 60,000 and
Heparin Induced Antibody titre was negative and this rose to
140K by discharge.Beta blockade was titrated and he was gently
diuresed toward his preop weight. Chest tubes and pacing wires
were removed per protocol. PICC line placed for access issues.
Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], no coumadin for his chronic A Fib as he refused
this previously. Continued to make progress and was cleared for
discharge to [**Hospital 16844**] Rehab on POD #7. All f/u appts were
advised.
