History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 year old female with a history of moderately
severe asthma requiring intubation who presents with shortness
of breath worsening over the past week.  She reports that her
exercise tolerance has gone down and attributes this
exacerbation to exposure to her daughter's dog and her son's
cats at home.  She denies fever, chills, runny nose.  Reports
dry cough, loss of appetite, and a little bit of bone aches in
her legs recently but "nothing like" before when she had a viral
illness.  Over the past week, her SOB has progressed and over
the past 24 hours she has been using her nebs continuously at
home.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.2, 97, 133/85, 24, 88% RA.
Appeared in distress, with wheezing, was having [**4-6**] word dyspnea
and was treated with nebulizers x3, methylprednisolone 125 mg
IV, and magnesium 2gm IV x1.  Peak flows 180, satting 96% on
3LNC.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she is resting comfortably in bed and
able to complete a full H&P without conversational dyspnea.  She
does not appear tired out and is not exhibiting increased work
of breathing.
At baseline, she is able to do her ADLs without resting, uses
oxygen 2L NC at night prn, does not use her albuterol at all
during the week.  She had been on prednisone for about 3 months
prior to [**Month (only) **] but none since.  Her baseline peak flow is
250.

IMAGING:
[**1-13**] CXR COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from [**2103-11-17**] and
chest CT from [**2103-6-4**].
PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Interstitial opacities
predominantly within the lung bases appear similar compared to
prior examination and correspond with known bronchiectasis. Mild
prominence of the upper lung vasculature suggests new
superimposed vascular congestion; however, there is no overt
edema or large effusions. No confluent consolidation is
identified.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
normal limits. No pneumothorax is evident. Healed right-sided
rib fractures are unchanged from prior.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable basilar interstitial markings consistent with known
bronchiectasis. No superimposed confluent consolidation.
2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion though no overt edema or
large
effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 year old female with a history of severe
asthma requiring intubation in the past who was admitted to the
intensive care unit with hyoxemic asthma exacerbation.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS BY ISSUE:
# Asthma exacerbation:  In the ED, she had already been started
on nebulizers, methylprednisolone, and magnesium.  Her asthma
triggers are allergic, including allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis (ABPA) although it doesn't look like she has been
treated with omeluzamab as an outpatient.  She has been on a
long steroid taper for ABPA this calendar year but not in the
past 1.5 months.  There was no evidence on her CXR to suggest a
focal pneumonia and she did not have a leukocytosis, thus
antibiotics were not started.  Additionally, she did not have a
viral prodrome to support nasal swab.  She was treated with
albuterol nebs q2h, ipratroprium nebs q6h, methylprednisolone 60
mg q8h x 1 day, then transitioned to prednisone 60 mg po.  Her
home montelukast, loratidine, fluticasone nasal spray and
fluticasone/salmeterol inhalers were continued. She has had
pneumovax.  She got the flu vaccine during this admission.  She
was transferred to the floor where she continued to improve.  On
the day of discharge she reported feeling back to baseline, was
breathing room air with good O2 saturation, minimal wheezing on
exam, and peak flows trending toward normal (was 200 at time of
discharge).  IgE was sent but was pending at the time of
discharge and should be followed up by pulmonary as they noted
that this would inform the rapidity of the prednisone taper.

CHRONIC PROBLEMS BY ISSUE:
# Hypothyroid: Continued home levothyroxine.

# Depression: Continued home buproprion.

# Hepatitis C viral infection (HCV): Last viral load 1,690,000
in [**2103-2-3**].  Not on treatment because she has been travelling
back and forth to [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].  Her PCP should discuss whether
or not pt requires hepatology follow up at next visit.
.
# Code: Full code confirmed
# Communication: son and HCP [**Name (NI) 915**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 101095**]

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please ensure follow-up with a pulmonologist outpatient since
her previous one (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4507**] is no longer at [**Hospital1 18**]
- Please set her up with hepatology as an outpatient for HCV
treatment
- please follow up IgE level
