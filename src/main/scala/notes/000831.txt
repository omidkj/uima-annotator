Cultures: Urine, blood x 2 and pleural no growth
Pleural tissue: no growth

CXR:
[**2105-12-22**] the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion has
substantially reduced, and there is improved aeration in the
left lung. The tube coiling over the upper neck has been
removed.  Ileostomy tube remains in place.
[**2105-12-21**] Tracheostomy tube is at the midline with its tip 5 cm
above the carina. A coiled tube is projecting over the
oropharynx and it is unclear if it represents an internal or
external device. It should be correlated with patient's
supporting devices.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval
development of
vascular engorgement/mild pulmonary edema since prior study
obtained on
[**2105-12-20**] increased opacification at both bases consistent with
volume loss and infiltrate. There is a right greater than left
pleural effusion. The left-sided chest tube remains in place.
The tracheostomy tube is unchanged.
