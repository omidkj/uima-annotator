History of Present Illness:
Father [**Name (NI) **] is an 80 year old male with past medical history
of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, OSA, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, anemia, h/o TIA and
COPD on 3-4L home O2 who presents with four days of worsening
dyspnea on exertion and non-productive cough.
.
In the past week, the patient has noticed increasing shortness
of breath. He was able to increase his oxygen concentrator in
order to walk around, initially, but eventually despite maximal
settings, he still felt short of breath and could not move. He
also endorses a dry cough X 3-4 days and feels as though he now
has something in his chest but has been unable to bring anything
up. Denies fevers/chills, symptoms of upper respiratory
infection (sputum, rhinorrhea, itchy eyes, sore throat). He
tried to increase his prednisone to 15mg daily, which did not
help. He also felt he gained 10 pounds (normal weight 178
pounds), which he attrbiutes to prednisone usage. He has had
multiple recent sick contacts (with URIs). Of note, patient has
been on vacation for the past 16 days, traveling on trains to NJ
and PA. No driving and flying recently.
.
He had his assistant call his outpatient pulmonologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], on [**12-13**] and was instructed to increase his
prednisone further to 20mg daily. He was also started on a Z-Pak
and saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the Pulmonary office on [**12-14**]. His INR
was noted that visit to be elevated to 5.3, possibly due to the
Z-Pak and thus, his Coumadin 8mg daily was held for two days.
Today his INR is 1.5. Because the patient's urinalysis from
[**12-14**] was also infected, he was switched off Z-Pak to
Ciprofloxacin. Patient saw his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1262**] ([**12-15**]) who did not
change current management. Ultimately, the patient developed a
strange sensation in his chest before lunch today that was
fleeting and self-resolving. He could not tolerate his shortness
of breath anymore and presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
Initial VS in the ED: 98.2 81 106/30 24 91% 3L Nasal Cannula.
Labs showed WBC 7.9, Hct 30.6, INR 1.5, Cr 1.1, Trop <0.01. CXR
showed no acute process, but with severe emphysema. Patient was
given 500mg azithromycin and 60mg prednisone and transferred to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxia and significant O2 requirement.  VS prior to
transfer: 98.4, 144/65, 82, 22, 91% on venturi mask 8L.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was breathing comfortably on
40% ventimask satting 94%. Other vitals: T: 98.0 BP: 161/75 P:
81 R: 16. Patient is without complaints.
.

IMAGING:

[**12-16**] wrist xray:
IMPRESSION: Small ossified body adjacent to the scaphoid bone
could be
related to remote trauma, although an acute fracture cannot be
excluded.
Recommend correlation with clinical exam, particularly within
the "snuff box." If clinical concern for a scaphoid fracture
persists, repeat radiographs in 14 days would be advisable.

[**12-16**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiac or pulmonary process. Severe
emphysema.

[**12-18**] Echo:
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
systolic function. Mild LVH. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets without stenosis.
Mild aortic and mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension. No evidence of intracardiac or intrapulmonary
shunting on bubble study.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2152-6-13**], the pulmonary hypertension is now mild. However, the
patient's underlying atrial fibrillation during this study may
underestimate true pulmonary pressures. The rest of the findings
are similar.

[**12-18**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral ground-glass opacities likely represent an atypical
infection.
2. Stable severe COPD.

Congestion and nodularity in the stomach compatible with
gastritis (biopsy)
Normal mucosa in the duodenum (biopsy)
