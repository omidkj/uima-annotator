Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**]
Chief Complaint:
LLQ pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
26 year old female with recent history of recent ([**10/2187**]) acute
liver injury secondary to Tylenol OD complicated by pancreatitis
and C. diff colitis presents with complaint of left lower
quadrant pain.

Pain similar to her prior endometriosis pain, in LLQ,
non-radiating, no alleviating factor.  She has a history of
endometriosis requiring surgery in 08/[**2186**].  She has been on
OCPs which were discontinued in [**Month (only) **] during her Tylenol OD
in 11/[**2186**]. She was more recently hospitalized for 3 days on
[**11-19**] for left and right lower quadrant pain attributed to
endometriosis after discontinuation of her OCPs.  A transvaginal
ultrasound demonstrated a stable hemorrhagic cyst.  Gyn was
consulted and OCP restarted.  With regards to her RUQ pain, it
was felt the patient may have had a mild recurrence of her
pancreatitis versus exacerbation of gastritis.  Given her
AST/ALT ratio, EtOH was considered a trigger.  Serum and urine
toxicology were negative except for opiods.  An abdominal
ultrasound was obtained and normal.  Her Protonix was increased
to twice daily.  Her hospitalization was complicated by a large
morphine requirement. Psychiatry was consulted and felt
adjustment disorder contributing to her poor pain control and
felt close outpatient follow-up would be preferential to
initiating inpatient psychopharmacy.  She was maintained on
morphine 4mg IV q3hrs with good control. She was transitioned to
morphine sulfate 15-30mg every 6 hours on discharge with a 1
week supply.

Since discharge 3 days ago she reports.  Her mother reports that
the patient has been taking large doses of morphine up to 21
tablets (of 15mg tabs). After the patient slept all day on
Thursday, her morphine was taken away by the mother on [**Name (NI) 2974**].
This morning, she awoke at 10:30 AM and complained of severe
left lower quadrant pain. She denied associated nausea, emesis,
diarrhea, constipation, fever, or chills. She has not had any
vaginal bleeding, dysuria, melena or BRBPR. No history of
gallstones. She further denies using over the counter
medications for pain control including tylenol or ibuprofen. She
denies recent EtOH use. Last sexual encounter.

In the ED initial vitals were, 99.5 170 137/109 22 99% room air.
 Labs were significant for a negative urine toxicology screen
and unremarkable cbc and chem10.  A pelvic ultrasound
demonstrated a complex left ovarian cyst of reduced size when
compared to recent imaging in early [**Month (only) 1096**] consistent with a
resolving hemorrhagic cyst. A UCG was negative. She was given
5mg morphine x 3, 1mg IV Dilaudid and 2mg IV Ativan x 2 and 5mg
PO valium x 2. Her heart rate was persistently in the 150s
prompting transfer to the ICU. Vitals on transfer were: 154 20
113/73 100% RA with 7/10 pain.

On arrival to the ICU, initial vitals were: 99 149 142/82 100%
RA.  She complained of [**5-18**] pain and significant anxiety,
tremulousness, and mild palpitations.

Brief Hospital Course:
26 y/o female with recent acute liver injury secondary to
Tylenol OD complicated by pancreatitis and cdiff colitis, known
endometriosis, presents with complaint of left lower quadrant
pain in the setting of her recently prescribed narcotic pain
medications being taken away.

# SINUS TACHYCARDIA: HR in 170s upon presentation to ED.
Etiology concerning for poorly controlled pain related to
endometriosis/hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, anxiety, opioid
withdrawal and benzodiazepine withdrawal. Most likely
multifactorial, involving all of the above.  In addition,
patient endorsed poor PO intake with a Cr bump from 0.5 baseline
to 1.0, so hypovolemia likely contributed.  Infection unlikely
in the absence of localizing symptoms, no cough, sick contacts,
urinary symptoms, fevers, chills, N/V/D. Recurrent pancreatitis
possible, however lipase was normal.  PE less likely as patient
recently on subcutaneous heparin in the hospital, OCP only
restarted a few days ago, no sign/symptoms of DVT.  TSH within
normal limits.  Urine toxicology negative, so toxic ingestions
unlikely.  Once pain medication was restarted (at doses given
during most recent hospitalization), tachycardia resolved.  In
addition, patient was given IVF then was taking good oral fluid
intake.  She was transferred to the floor where she remained
stable with HR ranging 90s-low 100s.  She was given IVF and
encouraged to drink.  She tolerated po fluids and food well and
was ambulating without difficulty.  At the time of discharge she
was medically stable with no acute medical issues.

# ABDOMINAL PAIN: recurrent issue leading to multiple
hospitalizations.  Patient seen by psychiatry (they have seen
patient during all of her prior hospitalizations) who felt
likely adjustment disorder in setting of uncontrolled pain which
may
