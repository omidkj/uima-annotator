CTA [**2-19**] -
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic
dissection.
2. Aspiration pneumonia involving the right lower lobe and the
lateral segment of the right middle lobe. There is opacification
of the airways of the right lower lobe proximally.
3. Interim placement of Y-shaped tracheal stent and esophageal
stent. The right limb of the tracheal stent extends
approximately 1.5 cm into the right mainstem bronchus; however,
the tracheal stent incompletely covers the fistulous connection.
4. Fluid level within the esophageal stent, likely predisposing
to aspiration.
5. Unchanged lymph nodes within the chest.


Brief Hospital Course:

aspiration and treated with Abx x7 days.  Flexible bronch showed
