Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Sudden onset of dizziness and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right heart catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 yo female with a history of pulmonary artery
hypertension (on a continous Flolan infusion via Hickman
catheter and 6L of O2), diastolic CHF, chronic afib, and HTN. On
the day of admission, the patient woke up at took her blood
pressure and found it to be in the 80's/40's. This is
significantly lower than her baseline blood pressure of 100/60.
The patient then went to the bathroom and had a BM. After she
got out of the bathroom, Ms. [**Known lastname **] suddenly became short of
breath, dizzy (she felt as if she would pass out), diaphoretic,
and felt her heart pounding. She did not have any chest pain,
nausea, or vomiting. At this time, she sat on the floor but this
did not improve her symptoms. There was no loss of consciousness
and the patient did not hit her head. While sitting on the
floor, the patient realized that she needed to change her Flolan
pump cassette and attempted to do so. However, this was a
difficult task due to her dizziness and she forgot to clamp the
Hickman catheter and blood began to backflow out of the catheter
onto the floor.
The patient then managed to activate EMS. EMS found Ms. [**Known lastname **] on
the floor, with cyanotic lips and breathless speech. The Hickman
catheter was clotted off and the Flolan would not infuse. Vitals
signs were as follows: HR: 80-120, BP: 100/60, RR: 26-28. She
was placed on 15L of O2 via NRB.
The patient was taken to [**Hospital3 3583**]. At this time the
patient felt much better and her vital signs normalized: HR:
73-76, BP: 99-123/54-83, 96-99% of 6L of O2 (here home dose.) On
exam, she was alert and oriented, with crackles at the base of
the lungs.
EKG: showed a rate of around 78 and afib. There were normal QRS
interval and normal axis. There was no ST segment elevations or
depressions. Possible Q waves in aVR, V1, and V2. There was no
hypertrophy and normal R wave progression. Labs showed Na-138,
K-4.2, Cl-105, HCO3-22, BUN 20, CR-1.1, Glucose 108, INR 1.66,
CPK 79,WBC-4.9, Hct 29.3. In the ED, Ms. [**Known lastname 62372**] Hickman's cath
was unclogged and Flolan infusion resumed.
.
On review of symptoms, the patient does endorse a [**1-27**] week
history of SOB on exertion and 1-pillow orthopnea. This SOB did
not improve with increases of Flolan and her pulmonologist was
concerned that her CHF was that actual cause of the SOB not her
PAH. In fact, it was planned for her to have a cardiac
catheterization. She has a long history of peripheral edema due
to her pulmonary artery hypertension which is unchanged in the
recent weeks. She does not report paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
hyperlipidemia, or diabetes. She denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.

Past Medical History:
1) Severe pulmonary artery hypertension -Initially presented in
[**3-1**]. The etiology of this PAH is thought to be due to multiple
factors including left-sided diastolic CHF due to HTN and
interventricular septal dysplacement, emphysema, possible
rhematologic condition (CREST). She was admitted in [**10-1**], at
which point an extensive work-up was done.
2) Emphysema
3) Raynaud's phenomenonlikely CREST syndrome-Positive [**Doctor First Name **] with
positive anticentromere antibodies.
4) Congestive heart failue and diastolic dysfunction
5) Alcoholic induced cardiomyopathy-improved when alcohol was
discontinued.
5) Chronic Atrial fibrillation-Failed attempts at cardioversion.
Now, rate controlled. Anticoagulated with Coumadin with goal of
[**12-29**]
6) Hypertension
7) Right upper lobe pulmonary nodule and mediastinal LAD on CT
in [**10-1**].
8) Ventral Hernia-No symptoms of bowel obstruction or abdominal
pain.
9) Cataracts-Scheduled surgery [**2126-6-4**]
10) Chronic Anemia-Baseline Hct around 30. Normal iron studies.
.

Social History:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an ex-nurse who lives alone in [**Location (un) 3320**]. She has two
daughters whom live in the area. She smoked heavily in the past
but stopped 30 yeasr ago. She also drank heavily but stopped 1
year ago. She never had any seizures or withdrawl symptoms.

Family History:
The patient's father had a stroke at 65 years of age. Her mother
had lung cancer.

Physical Exam:
VS: T 99.1 , BP [**9-/2084**] , HR 68 , RR 20, O2 % 97 on 6L nasal
cannula
Gen: Female in no distress. She is oriented to person, place,
and time. Mood, affect appropriate. Pleasant.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple. Difficlut to assess JVP due to carotid pulse and
large external jugular.
CV: Irregular rate with normal S1 and S2. There is a III/VI
systolic murmur loudest at the right sternal border.
Chest: Patient is on nasal canula and breathing comfortably with
no accessory muscle use. No cyanosis. No chest wall deformities,
scoliosis or kyphosis. There where bilateral crackles. No
wheezes.

CHEST XRAY [**2126-5-30**]: Heart size is markedly enlarged increased
diameter compared to [**1-30**] due to known pericardial effusion
increased in size. The widespread bilateral interstitial
abnormalities represent known micronodular centrilobular
interstitial pattern which might be due to active inflammation
or lymphoproliferative disorder in the chest.
.
TTE [**2126-5-31**]: Mild symmetric LVH  with normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF >55%). Moderately dilated RV with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis and abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate sized circumferential pericardial
effusion without
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
RIGHT HEART CATH [**2126-5-31**]: Elevated right-sided filling pressures
with RVEDP of 14 mm Hg. Severe pulmonary arterial systolic
hypertension with PASP of 90 mm Hg.  The left sided filling
pressures were mildly elevated with mean PCWP of 13 mm Hg.  The
cardiac index was preserved at 2.8 L/min/m2.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 yo female with a history of pulmonary artery
hypertension, diastolic CHF, and chronic A-fib, and HTN who
presented with an acute episode of SOB, dizziness, and
diaphoresis. This is in the setting of worsening SOB on exertion
for 3-4 weeks and a non-functioning flolan pump.
#) Pulmonary hypertension-- The etiology of her symptoms was
best explained by acute worsening of her pulmonary hypertension
due to lack of flolan, resulting in acute decompensated
right-sided heart failure. Right heart cath revealed severe
pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension.  While the patient
reports dysfunction of the Flolan infusion after symptoms
started, it is possible that the pump was malfunctioning before
the event. Patients on Flolan can be very dependent on the
infusion for survival. The flolan pump was re-started and her
rate was up-titrated as tolerated to a rate of 27. The patient
responded well to
