                        ADDENDUM

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiac; ischemia: The patient had no
further angina after coming out the CCU.  She was continued
on her Aspirin, statin and Plavix for recent stent, and all
of these will continue as an outpatient.

Cardiac; valvular:  The patient was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**]
of Cardiothoracic Surgery after being moved out to the floor.
After discussing the pros and cons of aortic valve
replacement/mitral valve replacement surgery with her, both
the patient and her family and the surgeon agreed that she is
not a surgical candidate.

Blood pressure:  The patient had an episode of hypotension on
the floor on [**2133-11-9**], symptomatic to 110/palp and
was transferred to the CCU where she received a liter of
fluid through a femoral line which was placed.

The patient was stable and moved out to the floor the
following day.  The femoral line was removed.  Subsequently,
the patient had episodes of hypotension, but as long as
asymptomatic, i.e., no dizziness, nausea or diaphoresis, the
patient was not bolused.

She remained stable following this episode but did run low
blood pressures, especially after hemodialysis during the
entire admission, as low as 80/palp.  The patient was
continued on Carvedilol, but on days of hemodialysis, she did
not receive Carvedilol.  This seemed to help with fluid
removal and blood pressure control.

Congestive heart failure:  The patient continued to have
fluid removed at hemodialysis, and her lungs progressively
started to clear over the course of her stay.  She required
no oxygen on discharge.

2.  Renal:  She continued Monday, Wednesday and Friday
dialysis while in-house.  Her Carvedilol was held the morning
of dialysis.  She continued on PhosLo and Nephrocaps.  On
discharge, the patient will start Digoxin to be dosed at
hemodialysis.

3.  Infectious disease:  The patient had no infectious issues
at discharge.

4.  Diabetes:  The patient had somewhat labile sugars during
her stay, and her Insulin was slowly decreased, as her
morning sugars tended to run low.  She continued on NPH
regular in the morning and the evening, as well as an Insulin
sliding scale.  For doses at discharge please discharge
medications.
