Pertinent Results:
.
Culture Data from OSH:
[**12-5**] blood cx: no growth
[**12-5**] urine cx: alpha hemolytic strep, GNR
[**12-5**] sputum cx: GNR, acinetocbacter (sensitive only to Bactrim)
.
Culture Data from [**Hospital1 18**]:
[**12-10**] Blood cxs: [**1-25**] Coag Negative Staph (anaerobic bottle)
[**12-10**] Urine Cx: Enterobacter cloacae (sensitive to bactrim,
imipenem, cefipime but resistant to Ceftaz, Ceftriaxone, Cipro,
Levofloxacin, Gent, Nitrofurantoin, Piperacilin; Intermediate
sensitivity to Tobramycin)
[**12-12**] Sputum Cx: Gram Negative Rods
[**12-12**] Blood Cx: NGTD
[**12-13**] Stool Cx: Negative for C dif
.
Chest CT Scan, [**2136-12-13**]: Persistent left lower lobe
consolidations with moderate left pleural effusion.  This may
represent atelectasis, but superimposed pneumonia cannot be
excluded.  Small right lower lobe consolidation and effusion,
but no new airspace consolidations.  Mild pulmonary edema.
.
CXR, [**12-10**]: 1.  Persistent left retrocardiac opacity which
appears to have increased in comparison to the prior study.
This may represent atelectasis and/or consolidation.  If this is
clinically feasible, further evaluation with dedicated PA and
lateral radiographs may be beneficial in characterizing this
further. 2.  Interval placement of a right PICC, with the tip
not well visualized secondary to overlying metallic hardware.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
A/P: 64 yo f with MMP, including spinal osteomyelitis, CRI, s/p
trach and PEG, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**], now with
recurrent fevers.
.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course: Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for recurrent
fevers.  She had multiple possible sources for her infection
including UTI (has chronic foley), known osteomyelitis and
epidural abscesses, sacral decubitus ulcer, PICC line (placed on
[**2136-11-26**]), and possible PNA.  The patient was continued on
Linezolid for the epidural abscess.  She was seen by ID and was
then switched from Linezolid to Daptomycin [**2-23**] increased
rigidity on physical exam.  She was also continued on Bactrim
for finding of Acinetobacter in her sputum from her previous
admission.  Blood cultures were sent and [**1-25**] grew Coag negative
Staph (in anaerobic bottle, identification pending).  This was
thought to likely represent a contaminant.  Repeat surveillance
cultures from the PICC line were drawn and are currently no
growth to date.  She was seen by ortho spine (who performed her
last spinal fusion) and felt there was no need for further
imaging or surgical intervention currently.  She was continued
on her current ventilator settings as she is trached and
ventilator dependent.  She has anemia of chronic disease and was
found to have a Hct upon admission 22.8 for which she was
transfused one unit PRBCs.  Her Hct remained stable after this
transfusion.  The patient has a history of eosinophilia of
unclear etiology.  This was monitored and trended downwards
slightly during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course - thought to lend evidence
toward a non-infectious etiology for her fevers.
.
.
#) Fever: The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics
with persistent fevers. Likely not infectious source. Per ID -
continue to treat with Imipenem until [**2136-12-27**] at which point
will begin nafcillin 2gm IV q 4 hours. Per ID, may also start
rifampin at that time.  Her med list was evaluated for
medications that could possibly cause a drug-fever and potential
offenders were discontinued. She actually defervesed and at the
time of her discharge she had not had fevers for 48 hours.
.
#) Resp failure: pt currently with trach, on vent. Had high RR
initially, but oxygenation remained good and these were
attributed to anxiety/agitation. She was liberated with PSV
trials of longer and longer duration, until switching directly
to a trach collar.
.
#) Abdominal tenderness: pt with hx of colonic thickening seen
on prior CT's.  LFT's, amylase, lipase within normal limits.
Her abdominal exam was benign during her stay.
.
#) Vertebral osteo: Initially treated with linezolid, but this
was thought to be cause of patient's fever. This was changed to
Imipenem. A course was defined by ID to run until [**2136-12-27**]
.
#) CRI: Was thought to be pre-renal on presentation. Patient
reutrned to baseline with hydration and was discharged with  Cr
of 0.9.
.
#) HTN: Restarted on antihypertensive metoprolol as her BP
tolerated.
.
#) DM 2: continued on RISS.  Blood sugars remained in good
control.
