History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 38-year-old Chinese-speaking female with a history
of secondary AML from her treatment for breast cancer, is
currently day 165 status post allogeneic stem cell transplant
from an unrelated donor for TBI and Cytoxan for conditioning
regimen. The donor was noted to be an antigen B mismatch, noted
to have an antigen mismatch as well as to B core positive
hepatitis B. The donor had a negative viral load. Ms. [**Known lastname **] had
been on lamivudine prophylactically. The patient had been doing
very well as an outpatient until a couple of weeks ago when she
is noted to have some blasts in the peripheral smear. Bone
marrow biopsy and aspirate revealed full both morphological and
cytogenetic evidence of disease relapse, noted at that to be 98%
donor. She was rapidly tapered off immunosuppression in order to
stimulate the donor T cells to hopefully initiated graft versus
leukemia effect. She has had no clear evidence of GVH at this
time, did develop a maculopapular rash and spotty areas around
the neck, back, torso, arms, and legs, which was very pruritic,
was evaluated by dermatology who thought that perhaps it was an
eczematous process possibly brought on by MRI contrast and was
not thought to be GVH, treated empirically initially with Lidex
ointment and then switched to triamcinolone cream with almost
complete resolution of the rash.
.
She has required periodic blood and platelet support since her
relapse. She recently has not had any evidence of circulating
blasts in her peripheral smear. She did have a bone marrow
biopsy and aspirate last week; the results are currently
pending. The patient reports that the rash had almost completely
resolved until a day or so ago when she had recrudescence of
some of her symptoms, started to use the triamcinolone cream
again and her symptoms have improved. She does continue to have
some mild pruritus in her chest and back. She notes that over
the last couple of days her eyes felt tired and dry. She notes
some pressure behind her right eye and has not really had any
headaches over the last couple of days but did have some
headaches a few weeks ago. We did an MRI which was essentially
negative. She continues to report significant fatigue and lack
of appetite. She denies any further back pain. Otherwise, denies
any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. Denies any
bleeding or bruising difficulties. Denies any fever, chills, or
night sweats. Denies any cough, shortness of breath, chest pain,
palpitations, or any other cardiac or respiratory difficulties.
Denies any lightheadedness or dizziness.

ONC Hx: She was diagnosed with Stage I (T1C, N0, M0) of right
breast diagnosed in [**2189**] and ductal in situ of the left breast
diagnosed in [**2189**].(LVI negative, ER positive, HER-2/neu

breast. She also received four cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan
chemotherapy (completed in [**2190-11-3**]). Bilateral
mastectomies were performed in [**2191-1-26**]. Tamoxifen was
initiated in [**2191-2-1**] though was taken off at time of
diagnosis of AML.

BONE MARROW BIOPSY
Note: Myeloblasts in the aspirate account for 70% of the marrow
cellularity.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Peripheral Blood Smears:
The smear is adequate for evaluation. Erythrocytes show
anisopoikilocytosis with ovalocytes, dacrocytes. The white blood
cell count appears decreased. Hypogranular neutrophils are
present. Platelet count appears normal. Large forms are seen.
Giant forms are not present. The differential shows: 13%
neutrophils, 1% bands, 2% monocytes, 90% lymphocytes, <1%
eosinophils, <1% basophils, 3% blasts.
.
Aspirate Smears
The aspirated material is adequate for evaluation. The M:E ratio
is 3.6. Erythroid precursors are markedly decreased with
megaloblastic changes. Myeloid precursors appear markedly
decreased in number and show a left-shift in maturation.
Megakaryocytes are virtually absent. The differential shows: 70%
Blasts, 4% Promyelocytes, 4% Myelocytes, 2% Metamyelocytes, 1%
Bands/Neutrophils, 2% Plasma cells, 11% Lymphocytes, 3%
Erythroid, 3% of Promonocytes/Monocytes.
.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides
The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation. The marrow
cellularity is approximately 10-20%. Hemosiderin-laden
macrophages are noted. The predominant population consists of
interstitial blasts greater than 70% of the marrow cellularity.
Erythroid precursors are decreased and present in small
clusters. Myeloid elements are decreased. Maturing myeloid
elements are greatly decreased. Megakaryocytes are decreased
with hypolobated forms and cells with disjointed nuclei. Marrow
clot section is not submitted. Touch prep is not submitted.
.
TTE [**1-10**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is borderline left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  Compared with the prior
study images reviewed) of [**2192-6-27**], there is now a small
pericardial effusion.
.
CT head [**1-24**]:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Persistent opacification of the right frontal sinus, anterior
right ethmoid air cell, and right maxillary sinus, the latter of
which is not completely included in the field of view.
.
CTA [**2193-2-3**]: No evidence of PE.  Large pericardial and pleural
effusion.
.
Echo [**2193-2-3**]: Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with
evidence of mildly increased pericardial pressures and global
biventricular hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation. Compared
with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-1-9**], the
pericardial effusion is larger (previously very small) and
global biventricular systolic dysfunction are now evident. These
findings are suggestive of myopericarditis or other diffuse
process. Serial evaluation is suggested.
.
Echo [**2193-2-8**]: The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
LV systolic function appears depressed. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion (maximal posteriorly @ 1.9
cm, minimal anteriorly at 0.8 cm). No right ventricular
diastolic collapse is seen. There is brief right atrial
collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early
tamponade. Compared to the prior study dated [**2193-2-6**], there is no
change. These findings are suggestive of elevated
intrapericardial pressures. Given the samll IVC
size and normal resp
