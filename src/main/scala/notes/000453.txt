PATHOLOGY:
COMMON BILE DUCT STENT PATHOLOGY [**2168-4-25**] POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT
CELLS,
  consistent with poorly differentiated carcinoma

PERTINENT STUDIES
# CXR [**2168-4-16**]: No significant interval change from prior with
continued chronic elevation of left hemidiaphragm and associated
left basilar opacity likely reflective of atelectasis. Right
PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC.

# RUQ U/S [**2168-4-16**]:
1.  Limited study. Gallbladder could not be visualized.
2.  Cirrhosis with ill-defined 15-mm nodule in the left lobe,
without a clear correlate on the prior MR.
3.  Stent in the CBD without intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
CT or MRI is recommended for further evaluation of the
gallbladder, as well as the left lobe hepatic nodule.

# MRI ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST [**2168-4-17**]
1.  Interval increase in the size of the hepatic mass in the
left lobe of the liver which causes more extensive obstruction
of the left lateral segment bile ducts and has increased
intraductal extent into the primary bifurcation of the biliary
system.
2.  Stable right-sided renal cysts, hepatic cyst in the left
lateral segment, and gallstones.
3. Rounded, expanded lesion in the right 9th rib at the level of
the
costochondral junction that demonstrates heterogeneous signal on
T2 weighted images and post contrast enhancement. Dedicated CT
examination is recommended to rule out metastasis.
4. Slight increase in size of satellite lesion (9 x11mm) in the
border of
segment V/VIII that shows increased signal on T2 weighted
images, arterial hyperenhancement and washout pattern.

# FIDUCIAL PLACEMENT [**2168-4-19**]
1.  Two gold fiducial markers placed within liver
