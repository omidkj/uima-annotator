No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11784**]
Chief Complaint:
aphasia and right hemiparesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV tPA and MERCI device


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67 year old right handed man with a past
medical
history significant for a.fib (not on Coumadin - for unclear
period of time, possible not since [**2122**]), HTN, HLD, DM - on
insulin, heavy smoking history who presents with a sudden onset
of right sided weakness, determined to have a LMCA syndrome at
an
OSH, given tPA and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

The story is not clear (he was unable to provide details and the
family was not present for the event). He was apparently in his
usual state of health and went out for a drive.  Per report (not
clear how this was obtained) he felt ill and pulled over to the
side of the road.  He was found by the fire service at ~11:30-40
to have right sided weakness and unable to speak and was taken
to
[**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**].  He was in the window and was given tPA after
consultation with tele-service.  He got 81mg of tPA at ~1:50pm
and transferred here.  There NIH scale was reported to be 21.

Here on examination he continued to have severe deficits, given
a
stroke scale of 23.  He had a CTA which showed a persistent L
MCA
clot and he was taken to the angio suite for intervention.


Past Medical History:
- afib w RVR, only on ASA not on Coumadin (unclear if ever was)
- CHF
- HTN
- DM on insulin
- peri-rectal abscess treated a few months ago


Social History:
Lives by himself in [**Location (un) **].  He is not employed.  He has a long
40 year x 3ppd smoking history, etoh use and uses pain pills
that are not his according to his daughter. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 17811**] (ex

Family History:
Mother with CA, father who fell and had cerebral hemorrhage
secondary to etoh in his 40s.

ADMISSION IMAGING:
ECG [**2128-8-27**]: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. No previous tracing
available for comparison.
.
CT BRAIN PERFUSION [**2128-8-27**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Left M1 cutoff with
increased MTT thoughout the left M1 territory. The perfusion
studies are limited and evaluation for mismatch and territory at
risk is not possible. This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 88862**] of
the stroke service and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Interventional
Neuroradiology, and the patient was brought for an
interventional procedure. 2. Ground glass opacities throughout
the visualized lung apices are non-specific and if clinically
indicated might be better evaluated with chest CT. 3.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
.
59 DISTINCT PROCEDURAL SERVICE [**2128-8-27**]: FINDINGS:
.
RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY INJECTION, PREPROCEDURE: There is
complete proximal M1 occlusion with distal collateral flow
provided by ACA branches and scant leptomeningeal collaterals.
.
LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY INJECTION, POST-PROCEDURE: The left
internal carotid artery and its distal branches are patent with
the exception of a proximal M2 branch, which demonstrates
sluggish flow indicating more distal occlusion. Lenticulostriate
luxury perfusion is noted. The anterior cerebral artery is
widely patent and provides collateral flow to the left cerebral
hemisphere.
.
IMPRESSION: Successful left MCA M1 division thrombectomy using a
combination of 10 mg of IV TPA and a Merci retrieval device.
There is residual sluggish flow and distal occlusion within a
proximal M2 branch.
.
PORTABLE CXR [**2128-8-27**]: FINDINGS: The tip of the endotracheal
tube projects 3.8 cm above the carina. The tip of the
nasogastric tube is projecting over the stomach. Mild bilateral
areas of atelectasis. No overt pulmonary edema. Low lung
volumes. The presence of minimal pleural effusions cannot be
excluded. The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper
range of normal.

PORTABLE CXR [**2128-9-4**]: FINDINGS: The position of the various
lines and tubes is unchanged. Cardiac size is within normal
limits. The lung fields are clear. There is no evidence of
failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
*)NEURO: Patient was admitted [**2128-8-27**] s/p large left MCA stroke
with resultant aphasia and right sided weakness. He received TPA
at an OSH and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for interventional
angiography which was able to partially recanalize his posterior
vessels. He was intubated for protection of his airway and cared
for in the NICU. The rest of his care proceeded according to the
stroke protocol including continued anticoagulation with ASA and
heparin and appropriate imaging. Over the course of his
hospitalization, the patient exhibited anisocoria (left 3nn,
right 2mm, only reactive on left), eyes that were closed at
baseline and he did not open them spontaneously,  with symmetric
grimace to pain in upper extremities. He exhibited no
spontaneous movements. At the decision of his family, he was
terminally extubated the afternoon of [**9-4**] and died peacefully
within 40 minutes of his extubation with his family at the
bedside.  They denied autopsy.
