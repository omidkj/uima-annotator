Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
52 yo male with a history of achondroplasia, HTN, OSA, COPD,
presents with respiratory distress. Reports feeling ill over
past week, with several days of dry hacking cough with white
sputum production which acutely worsened over the last few days.
He has also had tachypnea, without any symptoms of shortness of
breath. Starting this pm, he noted slow-onset progressive
tachypnea and coughing fit at rest. Called EMS. En route, 87-88%
on 2-4L NC. Given 2 albuterol and 1 ipratropium neb en route
with minimal relief.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 100.5 122 148/86 36 98%NRB. Triggered for
RR 36 and 92% on Venturi Mask (31% FiO2). In moderate
respiratory distress, wheezy. CXR showed RLL opacity. He was
given continuous nebs, methylprednisolone 125mg IV once,
azithromycin 500mg. Levofloxacin was given and vancomycin
ordered but never given. No leukocytosis or elevated lactate. He
was unable to be weaned from the venturi mask (goes into 80s,
low 90s with Venti mask). Gave 1g APAP. Access is 18g and 20-22g
PIV. Current VS: 100.3 124 135/76 32 94% Venturi mask.
.
On the floor, he is tachypneic, but comfortable and states that
he is breathing pretty close to his baseline breathing at home.
He says he is much better than when his "cold" started a little
over a week ago, and pretty much back to normal. He admits to
low grade fever of 100.5 last night, as well as cough x1 week
with white sputum production. He admits to constipation, and a
dry throat. He also admits to recent weight gain over the past
week, though he's unsure of how much. He denies any CP,
palpitations, PND, orthopnea, HA, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. He
denies myalgias.

IMAGING:
EKG [**2136-4-23**]: Sinus tachycardia with ventricular premature beats.
Right inferior axis. Consider right ventricular hypertrophy or
pulmonary disease. Since the previous tracing of [**2135-9-7**] the rate
is faster. Ventricular premature beats are new.

CXR [**2136-4-23**]: FINDINGS: Two AP upright portable views of the
chest were obtained. The examination is underpenetrated due to
patient body habitus. There is obscuration of the lateral left
hemidiaphragm, unchanged since the prior study, which may be due
to overlying soft tissue. Right mid-to-lower lung opacity and
subtle left retrocardiac opacities are similar to that seen on
[**2136-6-30**], and may relate to atelectasis; however, in the
appropriate clinical setting, infectious process and/or
aspiration is difficult to exclude. The cardiac and mediastinal
silhouettes are stable.

CTA [**2136-4-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism in the first- to
third-order pulmonary arteries, a segmental or distal pulmonary
embolism cannot be confidently excluded due to suboptimal
opacification and excessive image noise secondary to body
habitus.
2. Right middle lobe 4-mm nodule stable since the CT of [**2133-8-11**],
presumed
benign , not requiring further CT surveillance.

CXR [**2136-4-25**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2136-4-23**] read in
conjunction with
yesterday's chest CTA:

Hazy opacification of the right lung has worsened; there is
greater
mediastinal vascular engorgement and probably new small left
pleural effusion, all pointing toward cardiac decompensation.
Obscuration of the left heart border is probably a combination
of pleural effusion and a large mediastinal fat collection seen
on the chest CT. Heart is enlarged, probably progressively since
[**4-23**].

The patient has an abnormal left first rib, probably originating
from the
cervical spine.
.
Blood cultures: 2/2 bottles of coag negative staph on [**2136-4-24**].
Negative cultures on [**2136-4-23**] and [**2136-4-26**].
.
Urine cultures: Coag negative stapho on [**2136-4-24**]. Negative
cultures on [**2136-4-29**].
.
Urine legionella antigen: Negative.
Influenza swab: Negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 yo M with dwarfism, hypertension and OSA with a past episode
of respiratory failure requiring tach/PEG, presenting with acute
respiratory failure due to a pneumonia with reactive airway
disease with a course complicated by coag negative staph
bacteremia.
.
The patient presented with cough, fever and respiratory
distress. He had a normal BNP, negative flu swab and negative
legionella urinary Ag. CTA chest ruled out a PE. CXR suggested a
pneumonia. He received a brief prednisone pulse, nebs and
levofloxacin with good effect. He was weaned back to room air
with overnight CPAP for known OSA at baseline. He will complete
a total 7 day course of levofloxacin and is discharged off of
steroids. He will continue with the use of inhalers at home. By
his report, his respiratory status was back at baseline at the
time of discharge.
.
The patient was found to have 2 bottles of positive blood
cultures with a positive urine culture, all growing coag
negative staph on [**2136-4-25**]. Preceding and subsequent blood and
urine cultures were without growth. Given the growth of the
bacteria in multiple sites and more than 1 blood culture bottle,
this was treated as a probable real pathogen. He will complete 2
weeks of vancomycin therapy.
.
In the setting of a steroid pulse, the patient's blood sugars
were high and he was maintained on glargine with regular insulin
sliding scale. At baseline his blood sugars are controlled by
diet alone and by the patient's report, his blood sugars were
checked and were normal in [**Month (only) 1096**] as an outpatient. After
discontinuation of the steroid, the patient was started on
metformin without insulin. He requi
