Admission Date:  [**2108-5-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2108-5-31**]

Date of Birth:   [**2060-9-16**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47 year old
male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and rheumatic
fever.  He was initially treated in 06/00, with atrial
fibrillation and congestive heart failure.  At that time,
rheumatic mitral stenosis was diagnosed by echocardiogram.
He was anticoagulated and placed on beta blockers and
cardioverted in 08/00.  On [**2108-5-3**], he was admitted again to
an outside hospital with congestive heart failure and atrial
fibrillation where he converted to normal sinus rhythm post
intravenous Diltiazem.  Again, he had atrial fibrillation
with pulmonary edema and was converted to normal sinus rhythm
with Sotalol and Lopressor.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2108-5-17**], with increased
dyspnea on exertion for mitral valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
2.  Rheumatic heart disease.
3.  Smoker one to two packs per day.
4.  ETOH one case of beer per week.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Sotalol 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. times seven days.
3.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Nicoderm patch 21 mg for seven days.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on the Cardiac
Surgery service.  An oral dental consultation was obtained
prior to valve replacement.  On hospital day number two, the
oral surgeon performed two extractions at the bedside.  The
patient remained in house for the next few days while
awaiting surgery.  A dermatology consultation was obtained
during this period to evaluate penile lesions and a diagnosis
of fungal infection was made and treatment was started.

The patient underwent a mitral valve replacement with #27
mosaic valve on [**2108-5-24**]. He tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the CSRU in stable condition.  He was
extubated on the same day.  He was considered stable enough
to transfer to the floor on postoperative day one.

On postoperative day two, his chest tubes were discontinued.
He made good progress and was ambulating well by
postoperative day three.  On postoperative day four, his
sinus rhythm converted again to atrial fibrillation with the
rate in the 130s and systolic blood pressure in the 130s. He
was treated with Lopressor intravenously and started on
Amiodarone.  He continued to be in atrial fibrillation over
the course of the next 36 hours.  At this time, he was
started on Heparin infusion for anticoagulation.

On postoperative day six, it was decided to get an
Electrophysiology consultation for the atrial fibrillation.
At this point, he converted to normal sinus rhythm.  He was
seen by electrophysiology and because of his history of
alcohol use and his reluctance to take Coumadin on a regular
basis, it was decided not to anticoagulate him any further.
He will be continued on the Amiodarone and will follow-up
with Electrophysiology at a future date for discussion on
anticoagulation/flutter fibrillation ablation.  He was
discharged home on postoperative day seven in normal sinus
rhythm in stable condition.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lasix 20 mg q.d. for one week.
2.  Potassium Chloride 20 meq q.d. times one week.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Percocet one to two tablets q4-6hours p.r.n.
5.  Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.
6.  Aspirin Enteric Coated 325 mg q.d.
7.  Glyburide 10 mg a.m. and 5 mg p.m.
8.  Amiodarone 400 mg b.i.d. times one week and then 400 mg
q.d. times one month and then 200 mg q.d.
9.  Lopressor 50 mg q.d.

The patient was sent home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor.  He
will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Electrophysiology.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.
