Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, AMS


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**1-15**] right femoral line placement
[**1-15**] left tunneled catheter removal
[**1-16**] left arterial line placed

History of Present Illness:
61 male with history of seizure disorder, nonischemic
cardiomyopathy EF 20-30%, ESRD on HD (T/Th/Sat, last session on
saturday), hepatitis B, CAD, CVA, recent admission for line
bacteremia given vanco for 2 week course, who was at his rehab
center and found to be febrile with altered mental status and
hypoglycemia. His sugars there were in the 30s and he was given
oral glucose which improved his finger stick to 156. His
baseline mental status is A+0x3 but today he was A+O x2.
.
Pt had recent admission in [**11/2119**] for staph epidermidis and
CONS bacteremia, thought to be from tunnel line (tunnel tip grew
CONS). At that time, tunnel line was changed ([**2119-12-4**], fluro
guided tunnel line, exchanged over wire). Pt was given
vancomycin for 2 week course, dosed per HD protocol.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, T 102.2 HR 105 BP 94/44 RR 18 pOx
98% 2L. Tm 104.
Pt noted to have pus coming out of his tunnel line on left. His
temp spiked at 104, SBP initialy 160s.  Tunnel line culture was
sent off.
AAOx2 (not to location).
Patient was given 4L NS, MAPs dropped to the low 60s, placed
femoral line (goal was to preserve other sites sinec pt likely
currently bactermic and will likely need new line), started
levophed infusion 0.06 (BP 94/45).
For fever of 104, given rectal tylenol 650mg, linezolid 600mg,
zosyn 4.5 (not given vanco bc history of VRE).
Cultures were obtained including blood, urine, HD catheter swab.
Labs were significant for CBC WBC 11.9, Hgb 9.4, HCT 31, PLT
366. N 88%. INR 1.3, PTT 34. Phos low at 1.6, Mg 2, Ca 9.7.
Lytes revealed UA: large euks, blood, 300+ protein, sh 1013, pH
6.5.
Na 135, K 5.1, Cl 94, Bicarb 25, BUN 33, Cr 8.2, Gluc 107. AG
was 16. Lactate 2.3.
ABG: pH 7.43, CO2 41, O2 58, HCO3 28
CXR showed: no signs of pneumonia, mildly increased pulm
vascular pressures.
Access includes 18G right and left forearm and right neck.
Femoral line and tunnel line.
Most Recent Vitals: 101 80/44 18 82 96% 2LNC

sharp and able to answer questions such as the details of his
PhD. Denies any pain anywhere, no cough, no abd pain, last bm
yesterday, no diarrhea, states he has been admitted several

Studies:
[**2120-1-15**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Mild cephalization which could reflect mild pulmonary venous
congestion.

[**2120-1-16**] Cardiovascular ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 55%) with
subtle basal inferior hypokinesis. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2119-11-30**], the LVEF has improved.

[**2120-1-17**] Radiology KNEE 2 VIEW PORTABLE RI
There are degenerative changes with narrowing of the lateral
compartment which causes valgus angulation at the knee. There is
spurring at the inferior pole of the patella. There is no joint
effusion. There are no focal lytic or blastic lesions. There is
some soft tissue swelling.

[**2120-1-18**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
HD catheter has been removed. There is no evident pneumothorax.
If any there is a small right
