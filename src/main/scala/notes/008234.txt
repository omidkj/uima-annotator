Carotid Bruit: left carotid bruit noted

Pertinent Results:
[**2148-4-25**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA with stenosis <40% .
Left ICA with stenosis 40-59%

[**2148-4-26**] Echo: Prebypass: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesia of the inferior and
anteroseptal walls.. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A mitral
valve annuloplasty ring is present. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in
person of the results on [**2148-4-26**] at 900am.
Post CPB: Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin and milrinone. LVEF=20%.
Bioprosthetic valve seen in the mitral position. It appears well
seated and there is trivial mitral regurgitation. Mean gradient
across the mitral valve is 7 mm Hg. Annuloplasty ring seen in
the tricuspid position. It appears well seated. There is mild
tricuspid regurgitation present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted prior to surgery to undergo surgical
work-up and initiation of Heparin. In addition he underwent a
ICD lead extraction by cardiology on [**4-25**]. On [**4-26**], he was
brought to the operating room where he underwent a
redo-sternotomy, mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve
repair and MAZE procedure. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. He did
require multiple gtts following surgery, including Epinephrine,
Milrinone and Vasopressin. On post-op day one he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated the next
morning. Nephrology was consulted on post-op day two because of
rising creatinine in the setting of acute kidney injury (ATN) on
chronic renal insufficiency. His creatinine ultimately came down
to 2.1 prior to discharge. EP service followed him as well and
an ICD was implanted [**4-29**]. He was also followed by the renal
service. He was gently diuresed toward his preop weight. Midline
was placed for access and then removed prior to discharge.
Transferred to the floor on POD #4 to begin increasing his
acitivity level. IV cefazolin started for sternal discharge
which stopped prior to discharge. He will continue on a short
course of oral keflex.Made good progress and cleared for
discharge to home with VNA services on POD #9. EP interrogated
his device [**5-5**]. Target INR 2.0-2.5. First blood draw [**5-6**]. All
f/u appts were advised.
