CT of the head showing a left temporal subarachnoid and

temporal contusion.

TLS:  Questionable L1 fracture.

Right hip:  Questionable right femur fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Trauma
Intensive Care Service.  A Neurosurgery consult was called.
Their recommendations included starting Dilantin, continuing
with blood pressures less than 140, and repeat CT scan of the
head in the morning.  Orthopedics was also consulted due to
the patient's right femur fracture.  Their recommendations
included an ORIF when the patient was stable.

During the patient's hospitalization stay, CT scan and MRI
showed blossoming of the intracerebral injuries.  The
patient's mental status deteriorated.  Neurosurgery's
recommendations were that time would be needed to clarify his
prognosis.  They also stated that his prognosis was poor.
The patient's neurologic status during that time also
deteriorated to the point, where he was unable to move his
lower extremities and had slight motor in his right upper
extremity.

Multiple family discussions were held during the
hospitalization, and it was decided on the [**6-9**]
after an extensive conversation with the patient's son and

care, the patient initially went into a respiratory arrest
followed by a cardiac arrest.  The family was informed and
the medical examiner was called and accepted the case.
