Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath/BiPAP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
65 year old female with severe COPD with history of several MICU
admissions for BiPAP and intubated last month presenting with a
four day history of shortness of breath. The patient has a long
history of COPD and is on home O2 and BiPAP at night. Per her
caregiver, the patient was started on acyclovir on [**2199-9-26**] for
an abnormality noticed by an ENT on her right TM. On [**2199-9-27**] the
caregiver [**First Name (Titles) 13431**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] eye swelling and a glassy look. Over
the weekend, the patient has reported not feeling right and c/o
shortness of breath. Last night, the caregiver wanted to take
her to the [**Name (NI) **] for dyspnea, but the patient refused. This
morning, she went to see the patient and the patient was sitting
on the bed naked, wrapped in a tablecloth and was "purple," and
reported shortness of breath. Initial oxygen saturation 80s on
home 3 L. They increased her O2 to 5L but sats remained in the
80s. They called EMS and she came to the ED for evaluation. En
route, she received combivent nebs and 500 mL bolus for bp
90/30. Patient reports chills and nonproductive, no fevers,
nausea, vomiting, chest pain or dysuria. Per her caregiver the
patient gets pneumonia several times per year.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 132/62, 84, 16, 100% with neb .
She was placed on 100% NRB with improvement in her O2
saturations. She was overloaded by exam and was put on BiPAP.
During her ED course, she became somnolent and was taken off
BiPAP onto 4-5L NC. Her mental status improved and at transfer
to the MICU she was satting 94-95% on 4L. She was also given 125
mg Solumedrol, 20 mg IV lasix, combivent neb, as well as
vancomycin, ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Her blood pressures
also became elevated after these interventions to SBP 219/87 and
she was started on a nitro gtt prior to transfer.

CXR - [**2199-9-30**]
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with pulmonary edema,
cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 65 year old female with history of COPD, on home O2, and
OSA, on home BiPAP, presenting with four day history of
shortness of breath.  The patient was initially evaluated in the
MICU prior to transfer to the medicine floor.   Presumed
diagnoses were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. On
floor patient was gently diuresed, and treated with a prednisone
taper, azithromycin, albuterol nebs, tiotropium, and
fluticasone-salmeterol with good effect.
.
1. Shortness of breath: likely pulmonary edema v. community
acquired pneumonia. The patient (unreliable historian) reported
a nonprod cough and chills, but there was no infiltrate on CXR.
Patient was treated with a course azithromycin for CAP. Received
one dose vancomycin in the ED, and also received ceftriaxone.
Given lasix in the ED and mild CHF seen on CXR, but clinically
no crackles currently on exam and BNP low.  Patient's breathing
improved on steroid taper, nebs.   Patient was breathing
comfortably on home NC O2 of 3L.
- fluticasone-salmeterol and tiotropium inhalers, and albuterol
nebs.
- QID fingersticks with insulin sliding scale prn for
hyperglycemia in setting of prednisone administration.
- Continued BiPAP at night.
- Continued 3L O2 by nasal cannula.
- Encouraged incentive spirometry.
- Continue azithromycin for CAP (day [**3-18**]).
.
#Acute-On-Chronic Diastolic CHF - Last ECHO [**2199-7-5**] showed
EF>75% with elevated LV filling pressures and mildly dilated LA.
 Patient with good diuresis over hospital course of >3L.
Breathing and LE both improved.
- Will need to continue lasix as outpatient as home regimen
.
#. Hypertension: On admission, patient had missed all her am
blood pressure medications and was put on a nitroglycerin gtt.
Initially relatively hypotensive in the ambulance, but responded
to 500 cc bolus.
- briefly on nitro gtt to control BP
- home antihypertensives restarted, will cont to monitor BP
.
#. Schizophrenia: continued prozac and ris
