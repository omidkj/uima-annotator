Epi-<1

Echo [**3-26**]: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is markedly dilated. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include infero septal, inferoir and
inferolateral walls. EF is 30 %. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild mitral valve prolapse of the
posterior leaflet. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Systolic flow reversal seen in the pulmonary vein. POST-CPB:
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position, with
trace MR and no paravalvular leak. There is no LVOT obstruction.
The post-bypass EF is now 35-40% on inotropic support.

CXR [**3-28**]: No pneumothorax. Improvement in right lower lobe
opacification.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 64525**] was initially seen in clinic and was admitted prior
to surgery secondary to Coumadin use. He stated he discontinued
Coumadin on [**3-22**] and was started on Heparin along with two
Vitamin K when admitted. He also underwent full pre-operative
work-up. His lab work, including INR, was suitable for surgery
and was brought to the operating room on [**2136-3-26**] where he
underwent a Mitral Valve Replacement and RF MAZE procedure via
Right thoracotomy. Please see op note for surgical details.
Following the procedure he was transferred to the CSRU in stable
condition with Inotropic support and Amiodarone. Later on op day
patient was weaned from sedation and awoke neurologically
intact. He was then extubated. He was weaned off of all
Inotropes by post-op day one and required Nitro for hypertension
(which was weaned off by POD#2). On post-op day two he had
multiple hypoxic events with decrease in his O2 saturations and
PaO2. He underwent a bronchoscopy for a therapeutic aspiration.
Multiple mucus plugs were aspirated from RUL/RLL. Post Bronch it
was noted his gag response had not returned and a bedside
evaluation was performed. He passed the swallow study and
eventually advanced to a regular diet without problems. [**Name (NI) **] on
post-op day two his chest tubes were removed. Mr. [**Known lastname 64525**] was
recovering well post-operatively and transferred to the cardiac
step-down unit on post-op day three. He continued to remain on
amiodarone for atrial fibrillation and Coumadin was started.
Physical therapy followed patient during his post-op period for
strength and mobility. On post-op day 6 he was doing well, but
required further physical therapy rehabilitation. His INR was
above 1.3 and was discharged against medical advice on
Amiodarone and Coumadin. He was informed that should not leave
because his INR was not theraputic. However, after  a long
discussion , he wished to leave. He will follow-up in 4 weeks
and earlier with his PCP and Cardiologist.
