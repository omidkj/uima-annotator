Brief Hospital Course:
52 year-old male with a h/o HCV, left hemiparesis [**1-21**] stroke,
HTN, HL who presents with altered mental status [**1-21**] pna and UTI.

.
#. Altered Mental Status: Multiple etiology contribute to AMS.
Patient was noted for agitated delirium in the setting of
infection (PNA and UTI), with baseline psychosis and cognitive
deficits secondary to stroke.  No acute CNS process or infection
as per imaging or LP.   History of hepatitis C infection and lab
work significant for mild transaminitis; though, no signs of
decompensated liver failure or hepatic encephalopathy.  Serum
toxicity was negative.  Required significant Haldol to control
agitation initially.  Psychiatry was consulted and recommended
to use only zyprexa with intermittent ativan at a PRN bases to
control agitation.  Patient's mental status improved after these
intervention.  He did not require haldol, easily redirectable,
responded well to 1:1 sitter with zyprexa PRN and ativan at
times of agitated delirium.  He remained stable at the time of
discharge with mental status at baseline confused and mummbles
spanish words.  However, he dose follow command and is able to
communicate his wishes.
.
# Pneumonia/UTI: Initial workup was notable for RLL pneumonia
(MRSA) and UTI (enterococcus) both were sensitive of vancomycin.
 This could have contributed to his AMS.  He completed 14 day
course of vancomycin.  Last dose was on [**2177-2-9**], he remained
afebrile afterwards.
.
# Abdominal Pain:  Patient complained of epigastric/RUQ pain.
Given elevated LFT's and history of HEP C, RUQ US was performed
which showed normal findings.  LFTs showed transaminitis, lipase
normal.  This presisted to the time of discharge.  Other
contributors of the transaminitis could be due to medications
like simvastatin.
.
# HEP C: Pt with mild transaminitis, no evidence of
encephalopathy per report. Ammonia level of 57. Last PCR showed
13.7 million copies. No treatment and followed by hepatology.
.
# HTN: on long acting nifedipine and Metoprolol Tartrate,
titrated to normal tensive.
.
# HL: cont simvastatin
.
# Constipation: Contributing factor to delirium - on docusate,
biscodyl, senna, and lactulose to titrate up to 2 BM a day.
.
# FEN: Regular; Cardiac/Heart healthy
.
# PPx: PPI/heparin sq/ bowel regimen
