Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  45% to 50%  >= 55%

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated LV cavity. Mildly depressed
LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets. Partial mitral
leaflet flail. No MS. Eccentric MR jet. Severe (4+) MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 15110**] to
the eccentric MR jet, its severity may be underestimated (Coanda
effect).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre-bypass:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
myxomatous. There is partial mitral leaflet flail of the
anterior and posterior leaflets. There are torn chordae
tendinae. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no pericardial
effusion.

Post-bypass:
The patient is receiving 0.03 mcg/kg/min of epinephrine for
inotropic support post-CPB. There is a well-seated bileaflet
mechanical valve in the mitral position with good leaflet
excursion. There is no paravalvular regurgitation. There are
small transvalvular regurgitation jets consistent with "washing
jets." The mean gradient is 5 mm Hg with a cardiac output of 6.2
L/min. Biventricular systolic function is preserved and all
other findings are consistent with prebypass finding. The aorta
is intact post-decannulation. All findings were communicated to
the surgeon intraoperatively.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day admission and underwent mitral valve
replacement surgery.  Please see operative report for further
details. He received cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics.
Post operatively he was transferred to the intensive care unit
for management.  In the first twenty four hours he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated
without complications.  He was started on coumadin for
mechanical mitral valve on night of surgery.  He remained
hemodynamically stable and was weaned off all drips. All lines
and tubes were discontinued in a timely fashion. Physical
therapy was consulted for strength and mobility. He continued to
progress and was ready for discharge home with services on post
operative day five.
