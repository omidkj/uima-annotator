History of Present Illness:
HPI: 63M COPD/asthma and OSA with continued tobacco use presents
with SOB x 1 1/2 weeks. 3 weeks PTA, pt was treated with abx
(levofloxacin 500 mg PO QD x 10 days) for a sinus infection
(mostly had sinus pressure/nasal congestion/discharge). These sx
essentially resolved, but patient subsequently developed
productive cough (yellow sputum) with SOB/wheezing x 1 [**2-1**]
weeks. He felt he was having post nasal gtt, which was building
up in his chest, and eliciting his sx. When these sx began, he
called his pulmonologist, who prescribed a prednisone taper. His
sx improved after completing the taper, but again returned. He
was started on a second taper, and was two days into the second
course but was breathing so poorly he could not move and was on
continuous home nebulizers, but no home O2. He currently feels
better after solumedrol and continuous nebs. He denies any
fevers, or chills, but wife noted he felt warm over last week.
He denies any other chest pain, pleuritic pain, abd pain,
nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, except constipation. No urinary sx.


In ED so received continuous nebs, solumedrol, ceftriaxone and
azithromax.  Admitted to MICU where treatment was continued with
improvement in respiratory status overnight. Now transferred to
Medicine for further care.
