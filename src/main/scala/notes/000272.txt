evidence of
pulmonary embolism within the main lobar or segmental branches.
2. New consolidation in the left lower lobe concerning for
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74199**] is a 55 year old man with a history of CML status
post allogeneic SCT complicated by GVHD of skin/gut on
immunosuppression who was admitted with RSV bronchiolitis that
was then complicated by hospital acquired pneumonia.
.
During this admission the following issues were addressed:

# Hypoxia: On admission the pt had a positive RSV assay on rapid
respiratory viral nasopharyngeal aspirate. The pt did not have
evidence of lower lung disease and his chest x-ray on admission
did not reveal an infiltrate. The pt also had a CTA of the chest
that was negative for PE. The pt was treated with
bronchodilators and received a single dose Synagis (15mg/kg) on
[**2104-12-5**] with improvement in oxygen saturation. During the
admission the pt required multiple transfers to the ICU for
hypoxia, and was diagnosed with hospital acquired pneumonia and
treated with Cefepime and Vancomycin initially. The pt then
developed a diffuse morbilloform eruption that was attributed to
Cefepime, and the antibiotic regimen for hospital-acquired
pneumonia was changed to Linezolid, Aztreonam, Cipro and Flagyl
per infectious disease recommendations. The pt was treated with
a total 14-day course and on discharge he was able to breathe
comfortably on room air and did not have any oxygen
desaturations on ambulation.

# CML: During this admission the pt was continued on his home
immunosuppressive regimen of prednisone, Cellcept and Neoral.
The pt was continued on his outpatient prophylaxis regimen of
acyclovir and posaconazole. The pt's most recent inhaled
pentamidine was on [**2104-11-25**]. During the admission the pt also
received a dose of intravenous immune globulin.
