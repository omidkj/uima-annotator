Chief Complaint:
nausea and emesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bilateral Nephrostomy Tube Placement [**2147-12-19**]


History of Present Illness:
53 yo f with hx of metastatic colon CA, Spanish speaking, who
presented with n/v/d and was sent to ER for evaluation from her
oncologist. She has not been eating or drinking for last 5 days
due to n/v after returning from a trip to [**Country 7192**]. She has
been having abdominal pain, but does not like to take her
narcotics.
.
On the floor (interview not with interpreter at this time, so
limited) pt complains of pain in her abdomen, worse with
sitting. Some right sided chest dicomfort. States she has had
swelling her LLE for about 1 month, but no pain in her leg. She
is not currently having nausea, but had some this AM. She
reports urinating today with no pain, but a small amount of
blood.
.
VS on arrival were 97.4 101 181/104 18. Pt was found to have ARF
with Cr from 0.8 to 6.7 and hyperkalemic to 7.2. She has a known
mass compressing left ureter and now with a new compression of
the right ureter on CT scan. Urology was consulted and
recommended IR to place a percut nephrostomy tube. Pt was tx
with D50 and insulin, and kayexalate 30. Hypoglycemia ensued
after tx and she was given a [**11-26**] amp D50 with improvment of BS
to 105. K down to 5.5. IVF x 2 liters were given. Pt also had a
neg head CT. Right sided CP, negative LENI, concern for PE, pt
not anticoagulated in ER. No CTA due to Cr. PNA present on CT.
She was given ceft and azithro. VS at trasfer HR-106, SBP-142
16, 100% RA, BS 105.

Past Medical History:
- adenocarcinoma of distal sigmoid colon [**1-1**], s/p sigmoid
colectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] on [**2144-2-17**]. T3 lesion measuring 7 cm x
6 cm x 4 cm,
low-grade, [**2-4**] lymph nodes were involved with cancer
- completed adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX in 10/[**2143**].  CEA
continued to slowly rise from 7 in [**12/2145**] to 9.5 in [**2-/2146**]
to 18 in 08/[**2145**].  CT imaging demonstrated new left
hydronephrosis with a 10.4 cm prevertebral mass at the point of
the ureteral obstruction.  PET scan in [**7-/2146**] confirmed disease

recurrence near the sigmoid anastomosis causing the ureteral
obstruction.  She additionally had evidence of metastatic
disease to the mesentery and mesenteric nodes.  She underwent
percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement on [**2146-12-8**]. [**Known firstname **]
completed two cycles of FOLFIRI and on CT [**2147-4-14**]
she had disease progression involving the known omental
metastases and innumerable pulmonary metastasis.
- admission for PE [**2147-4-17**] for inpatient anticoagulation.
- [**2147-6-20**]: Discussion for participation to a clinical trial
with Cisplatin / V1 inhibitor
- [**2147-7-21**]: left sided nephrostomy tube replacement
- [**7-/2147**]: nephrostomy tube removal
- [**2147-8-23**]: Start on Capecitabine
- Left hydronephrosis with 2.4 cm prevertebral mass at the point

of apparent ureteral obstruction in pelvis. Failed ureter stent
.


Social History:

cleaning person. She does not presently smoke cigarettes but did

smoke about two cigarettes per day for 20 years and quit three
yrs ago just prior to her surgery.  She does not drink alcohol

Imaging
[**2147-12-18**] CXR
1. New small right pleural effusion, with right lower lobe
atelectasis or
consolidation.
2. Diffuse pulmonary nodular metastases.
.
[**2147-12-19**] CT Abd
1. Right lower lobe pneumonia and trace effusion.
2. Apparent increase in size and number of metastatic pulmonary
nodules at
the lung bases.
3. New heterogeneously hypodense liver. This could represent
fatty
infiltration, but congestive edema and/or diffuse metastases are
not excluded.
4. New mild-to-moderate right hydronephrosis, with incompletely
visualized transition point in mid right ureter, suggestive of
obstruction by peritoneal metastasis.
5. Chronic left moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis and atrophy,
secondary to obstruction by left L5 paravertebral mass.
6. Multiple prominent fluid-filled small bowel loops, suggestive
of ileus or partial obstruction secondary to increasing
mesenteric adhesions.
7. Diffuse omental and peritoneal implants.
8. Cholelithiasis.
9. Fibroid uterus.
.
[**2147-12-22**] Nephrostomy Tubes Placement
Bilateral ureteric stenoses, more prominent on the left side.
Satisfactory placement of bilateral nephroureteric stents (8
French x 24 cm). Patient would require routine stent change in
three months.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
53yo female with w metastatic colon cancer admitted with acute
ureteral obstruction secondary to metastasis, now status-post
bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement, hospital
course complicated by pyelonephritis and community acquired
pneumonia, treated with antibiotics, made comfort measures only,
discharged to home with hospice care
.
ACTIVE
# Acute Kidney Injury: Patient was admitted with a creatinine of
7.2 secondary to obstructive uropathy from compression by
peritoneal metastases.  Patient underwent placement of bilateral
percutaneous nephrostomy tubes by IR [**2147-12-19**], and
nephrouretheral stents on [**2147-12-22**], after which the patient's
Cr trended down to 1.3.  The patient had good UOP from right
urostomy, but poor output from L nephrostomy tube (<100cc/day)
which was thought to be secondary to known chronic
hydronephrosis.  Urine cultures from L nephrostomy tube grew
MSSA, prompting antibiotic treatment with 5d augmentin and 14d
doxycycline.  After 1wk abx, repeat culture was negative and the
L tube was capped.  The R tube was not capped, given continued
high output from the R nephrostomy tube, thought to be secondary
to known compression of the bladder by peritoneal metastases.
.
# Community Acquired Pneumonia: Admission CXR demonstrated RLL
consolidation, for which the patient received 5d augmentin, 14d
doxycycline.  At discharge patient was given script for
remainder of doxy course.
