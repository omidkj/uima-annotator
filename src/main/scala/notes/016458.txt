History of Present Illness:
81yo F with h/o CABG in [**12/2154**] (vein grafts PDA, OM, and OM-2)
and subsequent interventions (most recent PCI in [**2162**]) who
presented to an OSH with dyspnea. Patient endorsed worsening SOB
and L arm pain since Saturday (3 days ago). ROS was also + for
cough. In the OSH ED, she was noted to have ECG changes and a +
troponin of 4. She was given ASA, enoxaparin, and Plavix load.
Her UA was positive and she had a leukocytosis, she she was also
given CTX and levofloxacin before transfer here. She also
recieved a dose of Lasix 40mg IV for pulmonary edema. In our ED,
cards was consulted and recommended giving atorvastain 80. TWI
were noted in V2-V6, I, and aVL. She had evidence of pulmonary
edema and and elevated BNP in the ED. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**]
for management of her NSTEMI and CHF exascerbation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T98.0, HR 65, BP 117/97, RR 17,
O2 sat 99% 2L NC.
Labs and imaging significant for BNP [**Numeric Identifier 29581**], Trop-T: 0.68, WBC
20.4, Cr 1.7, CXR showed mild to moderate interstitial edema and
small pleural effusions. UA + for large leuk, 90 WBCs, and few
bacteria.
Patient given Levaquin (750mg), ceftriaxone (1g), Plavix
(300mg), Lasix (40mg IV), asa (325), Lovenox (70mg) at OSH and
atorvastain 80mg here.

Cath [**2166-3-25**]
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated native 3-vessel
coronary
artery disease. The LMCA was diffusely diseased with 30-40%
stenosis.
The LAD gave rise to three diagonal vessels free of significant
disease.
There was a 90% mid-vessel stenosis. The LCx was occluded
proximally.
One OM and part of the LCx proper filled retrograde via
collaterals from
the LAD. The RCA was occluded at its ostium. The R-PDA and RLV
as well
as the distal RCA filled via left to right collaterals from the
LAD.
2. Supravalvular aortography demonstrated all three vein grafts
were
flush occluded as was the native RCA. Only the LMCA filled.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal central aortic
pressure.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease with all three vein
grafts
occluded and the entire coronary circulation supplied via the
LAD which
is significantly compramised by a mid-vessel stenosis. This is
the
likely culprit for the NSTEMI.
2. Recommend cardiac surgery evaluation for CABG suitability
versus PCI
of the LAD.
.
CXR [**2166-3-25**]
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate
stable
appearance of median sternotomy wires and multiple clips related
to prior
coronary bypass grafting. The heart is top normal in size.
Thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous. There is increased perihilar
vascular congestion and a few peripheral Kerley B lines,
suggestive of mild interstitial edema. There is no pneumothorax.
Small pleural effusions are noted posteriorly. Trace
retrocardiac atelectasis is present. Cholecystectomy clips are
present.
MPRESSION: Mild to moderate interstitial edema and small pleural
effusions.
Big LA

Conclusions
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesia of the apex, apical, mid and basal portions of the
inferior wall. The apical and mid portions of the inferoseptal
and inferolateral walls are hypokinetic. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35
%). with mild global RV free wall hypokinesis. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis
(area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results on [**3-31**]/2011at 900am.

Poor image quality that somewhat improved once the chest was
open.
Post bypass

Patient is A paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine
amd milrinone. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Aorta is intact post decannulation. Moderate mitral
regurgitation persists.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
81yo F who presented to OSH with dyspnea who was found to have
ECG changes and elevated troponin consistent with NSTEMI, CHF
exacerbation and and UA/leukocytosis indicative of UTI. She
received a 3-day course of quinolones, and UCx was ultimately
negative. She went to cardiac cath soon after arrival to the
cardiology floor. She was found to have occluded all of her SVGs
as well as her RCA and LCx. She also has a tight LAD stenosis.
She has collaterals from the left to the RCA territory. Cardiac
surgery was consulted, and the plan was made for a re-do CABG on
[**Year (4 digits) 766**], [**2166-3-31**]. Plavix was stopped to allow for washout prior
to surgery. She was continued on ASA, heparin gtt, metoprolol,
and atorvastatin 80. She had some dyspnea on exertion while on
the medical floor, but no chest pain or other acute anginal
equivalent. Her EF was 35% on echo, compared to "low normal"
from
