ECG Study Date of [**2140-4-12**]

Sinus tachycardia and occasional ventricular ectopy. Lead V3 was
not obtained. Wandering baseline. Slight ST segment depressions
in leads V5-V6. In the context of poor quality ECG, repeat
tracing of diagnostic quality is suggested. The rate has
increased as compared to the previous tracing of [**2140-4-10**], and
except for ventricular ectopy, there is no diagnostic interim
change.


CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2140-4-16**]

CHEST: The heart is enlarged and unwinding of the aorta is
present. Upper zone redistribution, suggesting some failure is
present. The tip of the right IJ line lies in the lower SVC. The
tip of the nasogastric tube lies within the stomach. Comparison
with the prior film shows some improvement in the degree of
failure.

IMPRESSION: Failure persists, but improved since [**2140-4-13**].
Line in satisfactory position

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wire is seen in the RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Mildly
depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal
inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate to severe [3+] TR. Moderate PA
systolic
hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:

The left atrium is elongated. There is symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy.  The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic  function is mildly
depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities  include
inferolateral hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and
free  wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No  aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic  hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

C.CATH [**2140-4-6**]

BRIEF HISTORY:   This is a 73 year old woman with a history of
diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipedemia who was referred for a
heart
catheter because of a NSTEMI. She underwent left CFA-popliteal
bypass
[**2140-3-29**]. Postoperatively she developed respiratory failure and
required
intubation. Her cardiac markers became elevated with a CKMB of
34 and
troponin of 0.68. The echocardiogram showed hypokinesis of the
inferolateral wall. The ejection fraction was estimated to be
45-50%.
The resting EKG showed SR and non-spec. ST-T-wave changes
laterally.

PTCA COMMENTS:
We elected to treat the OM with PTCA/Stenting using heparin and
integrilin prophylactically.  The sheath was upsized to 7
French, and a
7 French XB 3.5 guide provided good support.  A PT [**Name (NI) 9165**]
Intermediate
wire crossed into the lower pole, and a Wizdom SS wire crossed
into the
upper pole.  A 2.0 x 15 mm Voyager was used to predilate the
lower pole
at 10 atm twice, and was also used to predilate the upper pole
at 12
atm.  The lower pole wire was removed, and the upper pole was
stented
with a 2.5 x 18 mm Hepacoat at 14 atm.  The stent was then
post-dilated
with a 2.75 x 13 mm Highsail at 18 atm twice.  Final angiography

demonsrated no dissection, no residual stenosis within the upper
pole
with a moderate residual in the lower pole, and TIMI-3 flow in
both
branches.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed aright dominant system
with
three vessel disease. The LMCA was without flow limiting
stenoses. The
LAD was diffusely diseased with up the 60% stenosis in the mid
segment.
The LCX filled a high OM1 which did not have flow limiting
stenoses. The
OM2 was a large vessel and had a 90% stenosis at the bifurcation
into a
large upper and a small lower branch. The RCA was diffusely
diseased
with 90% proximal, 90% mid and 100% mid occlusion. The diastal
RCA
filled via left to right collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics showed moderately elevated right
and
left sided filling pressures (RA mean 12 mmHg, RVEDP 20 mmHg,
PCW mean
22 mmHg). There was moderate pulmonary hypertension (PA mean 35
mmHg).
The cardiac output was normal (CO 6.1 l/min, CI 2.6 l/min/m2).
3. Successful PCI of the upper pole of the OM with a 2.5 x 18 mm

Hepacoat stent, post-dilated with a 2.75 mm balloon.  The lower
pole of
the OM was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. Successful PCI of the OM.
