Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
bloody emesis, dizziness

[**2126-12-19**]: EGD
[**2126-12-26**]: Pacemaker Placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11469**] is a 79-year-old male with PMH significant for DM-2,
history of CAD (2VD), TIA, prior lung CA & colon CA, who was
admitted after he was found down on [**12-18**] by [**Hospital3 **]
caretaker covered in bloody emesis. Patient reports he felt
lightheaded while on sofa, fell down to ground and unable to get
up. Reports LOC. Only prodromal symptom was emesis. He believes
he may have been passed out for approx 2 hours. When he "awoke,"
he called out for help.
.
Brought to the ED by ambulance. In the ED, vitals were 94.6 102
146/100 22 90% 2L. NG lavage with coffee grounds but eventually
cleared. CT head and neck were negative. Stools brown but were
guiac positive. Initially thought to be hypovolemic with
elevated lactate but this improved with 3L IVF. No gross
bleeding in the ED, BPs as low as 82/63 initially but
110's-130's subsequently. He had a chest xray that was
concerning for pneumonia and he was given vancomycin 1g, Zosyn
4.5g, Azithromycin 500mg IV. Also treated with protonix 40mg,
and tylenol.
.
He was admitted to the MICU for sepsis vs hypovolemia and HCT
monitoring. His initial HCT was 32 on [**12-18**]. The following day,
his HCT was stable at 29. On [**12-19**], he had an EGD which Dieulafoy
lesion which was injected w/ epinephrine and treated with
thermal therapy. The EGD also showed erythema and ulceration in
the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction
compatible with esophagitis as well as erosion and erythema in
the pylorus compatible with erosive gastritis.
.
On the morning of [**12-19**], he had several runs of ventricular
tachycardia but they resolved. Prior to floor transfer, he
reported left sided chest pressure. Nothing made it better or
worse, was not reproducible. He appeared comfortable and was
talking in full sentences. EKG was repeated and appeared
unchanged. Per reports he continued to have more frequent NSVT
up to 22-24 beat maximum with additional wenkebach AV
prolongation and AV block per reports. A TTE was done and showed
severe left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic
function. LVEF >55%. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. On nuclear stress test, exercise portion showed no
anginal symptoms or significant ECG changes, and perfusion
portion showed no deficits. EP team was consulted for the
patient's various arrhythmias including his wenckebach, blocked
APBs, and recurrent NSVT episodes. Ultimately he got a dual
chamber [**Company 1543**] PM, and he is now v-paced and doing well
clinically. Vital signs have been stable post procedure.

EKG : [**2126-12-18**] -rate 90s, Baseline artifact
Normal sinus rhythm , Left axis deviation , Left anterior
fascicular block
Consider right ventricular hypertrophy.
.
EKG [**2126-12-19**] -rate 80s, Artifact is present. Probable sinus
rhythm but an ectopic atrial rhythm cannot be excluded. Left
axis deviation. There is an early transition which is
non-specific. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. The P-R interval
is prolonged. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.
Compared to the previous tracing the rate is faster.

.
[**2126-12-18**] CT HEAD: There is no intracranial hemorrhage. There is
no mass, mass effect, edema, or evidence of acute vascular
territorial infarction. There is moderate periventricular white
matter hypodensity, which most likely represents sequelae of
chronic small vessel ischemic change. More focal hypodensity in
the bilateral basal ganglia likely represent areas of chronic
lacunar infarction. There is mild global atrophy. There is no
fracture. Visualized paranasal sinuses are normally aerated.
Cerumen noted in the EAC bilaterally. IMPRESSION: No acute
intracranial process.
.
[**2126-12-18**] CT C-SPINE: IMPRESSION: No cervical spine fracture or
malalignment. Degenerative changes as described above.
.
[**2126-12-18**] PORTABLE ABDOMEN:
Comparison made to CT from [**2123-3-17**]. Multiple gas-filled
presumed loops of bowel are seen in the right inguinal region,
likely representing patient's known right inguinal hernia.
Compared with prior CT, the amount of herniated bowel appears
increased allowing for differences in modality. No dilated loops
of bowel are seen and there is no evidence of bstruction. Stool
is seen throughout air-filled loops of non- dilated colon.
Multiple surgical clips are seen in the mid abdomen. Visualized
osseous structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Multiple loops
of bowel in right inguinal hernia, without definite evidence of
obstruction.
.
[**2126-12-18**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Post-operative change in the right
hemithorax. No acute cardiopulmonary process
.

[**2126-12-19**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is severe
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root i
