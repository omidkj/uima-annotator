History of Present Illness:
 66 yo M with metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma, known
mets to lungs, brain, back, heart came into the ED today with
[**2-16**] d h/o weakness, dizziness, fatigue. He has h/o RV mass and
"abnormal EKG" in the past. He had [**1-15**] syncopal episodes in that
time and fell on back yest with residual L lower back pain. Seen
at [**Hospital6 33**] yest with EKG showing A-fib, rapid
ventricular response, RBBB, T wave abnormality. Received 150 mg
Amiodarone, 1 mg Dilaudid (back pain) and was transferred at his
request to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Regarding his cancer history, developed left lower back pain
towards the end of 7/[**2142**]. Workup included a CT scan of his
abdomen dated [**2142-8-5**], which showed a 10.1 x 8.2 cm lobulated
enhancing soft tissue mass causing distortion of the underlying
renal architecture of the left kidney. He was concurrently
diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism and eventually underwent a
left radical nephrectomy with inferior venacavotomy and complete
excision of the renal vein with inferior vena caval
reconstruction and removal of tumor thrombus. This was performed
on [**2142-8-16**]. The pathology from the nephrectomy showed renal
cell carcinoma of papillary subtype, which was 11.5 cm in
greatest dimension. He was followed clinically following this
period but developed metastatic disease in the lumbar spine,
which was symptomatic as well as enlarging pulmonary nodules. He
underwent radiation to the lumbar spine, which resulted in
significant amelioration of symptoms. He has receveid 4 cycles
of temsirolimus with compllication of pneumonitis. On [**1-15**], Mr, [**Known lastname 22956**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with right hand numbness
which perisisted. HIS head CT revealed a left parietal
hemorrhage with some mild mass effect. He was given a Keppra
load of 1000 mg a day and was taken off subsequently. His head
MRI revealed at least one metastatic focus that was hemorrhagic
in the left posterior frontal lobe, precentral in location. He
was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] at that time for consultation. He was
taken off of the Lovenox and was discharged to home with follow
up with neurology. MRI imaging on [**2-17**], according to Dr. [**Name (NI) 23016**] note, revealed, "a good resolution of the blood in
the left posterior frontal metastasis; however, now, the right
temporal FLAIR signal abnormality appears to have bled and is
now approximately about 1.5 cm with some mild surrounding
edema". On that day in onc clinic, his Sutent dose was decreased
to 37.5mg daily secondary to symptoms.
.
Of note, he has a history of PE that was diagnosed incidentally
along with RCC ([**7-19**]), with no sx at that time. He was started
on coumadin which was continued until [**2143-8-8**] then changed to
Lovenox but D/C'd in [**Month (only) **] when brain mets were discovered
and now has continued to be off anticoagulation completely.
.
In the ED tonight T98 HR 100 RR 18 BP 101/66 Sat 98% 2L. EKG
showed NSR at 93 bpm, 1 AVB, RBBB, no acute ischemic changes. He
was tired with a nonfocal exam. CXR: mass-like airspace dz in R
lung base (old). He had a D-dimer sent which was >5000. He
subsequently underwent a V/Q scan yielding a large area of
mismatched hypoperfusion in the right upper lobe with a
moderately high risk ratio for pulmonary embolism. Given
inability to anticoagulate him, IR was called and plan on
placing an IVC filter in the am. In the meantime, they
recommended Mucomyst and Bicarb O/N pre-procedure as he has a
chronic renal insufficiency.
.
ROS: He reports fatigue requiring him to sleep approximately
10-12 hours a day. He has occasional shortness of breath and
dyspnea on exhertion. His oxygen saturation with ambulation was
documented by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] 99%-100%. He reports cough in
the mornings but not everyday. He denies any epistaxis. His
nausea is poorly controlled with ondansetron.

Currently undergoing treatment with temsirolimus at 37.5 mg
intravenously once weekly.

=========================================================
EKG: NSR at 93 bpm, 1 AVB, RBBB
.
[**2-22**] CXR: FINDINGS: Two views are compared with very recent study
dated [**2144-2-17**]. There is a patchy airspace process at the right
lung base, likely in the middle lobe, not much changed. There
are also number of small nodular opacities elsewhere, likely
corresponding to known pulmonary metastases. However, no new
focal airspace process is identified to suggest acute
consolidation. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary
vessels are unchanged, with no pleural effusion or other
evidence of CHF.
.
[**2-22**] Lung Scan 1. Large area of mismatched hypoperfusion in the
right upper lobe with a moderately high risk ratio for pulmonary
embolism.
.
MR 2/4/8 IMPRESSION: Slight decrease in size of previously seen
metastatic focus in the left frontal lobe. New hemorrhagic
lesion, presumably a metastasis in the right frontal lobe, with
the multiple hyperintense lesions in the frontal and parietal
lobes now more likely representing tumor. Left-sided arachnoid
cyst is unchanged. Per online medical record, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] has
already reviewed the imaging with the patient.
