Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
leg swelling


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Persantine MIBI exam


History of Present Illness:
81 y/o M with hx of COPD, CAD, AAA, and BPH presents today after
a recent admission for PNA with new swelling and discoloration
of his bilateral feet.  He was found to be newly hyponatremic to
a Na of 117 in the ED and therefore admitted to the MICU.
.
He was discharged last Wednesday (5 days prior to admission), he
was discharged to home after being diagnosed with a pneumonia.
During his admission, he had worsening renal failure and
evaluated with a renal ultrasound that did not show hydro. His
respiratory status returned to baseline.  He was discharged home
on augmentin.  His Na had already started to drift downward
during the admission and was 129 on discharge.  He also had mild
diarrhea during his admission.
.
After going home, he was mostly in bed due to profound weakness.
 His family was watching his legs and noted the little bit of
swelling and new blue color.  They called his PCP today who
suggested ED evaluation.  He otherwise has no complaints.  He
has generalized weakness and intermittent periods of shortness
of breath.  Per the daughter, he has been not eating, but trying
to drink a lot.  He is afraid to sleep because he is scared of
death.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.8, P 80, BP 147/74, R 24 and
99% on 3L (his home O2 level).  He remained stable with some
hypertension to SBPs in the 170s.  He had a CXR that showed mild
fluid overlad.  He had a CT abd that showed no aortic aneurysm
leak.  Vascular was consulted and worried that his foot
discoloration was related to embolic events and heparin was
started with a bolus.  The patient was guiac negative in the ED.

Studies:
[**2110-8-12**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed with inferior/inferolateral akinesis with hypokinesis
elsewhere (LVEF= 35%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2104-10-2**], left ventricular function is now
depressed.
.
[**2110-8-17**] CXR read:
Portable chest radiograph is compared to multiple prior
examinations. Since the prior study, there is mild improvement
in the right lower lobe with decreased right pleural effusion
and atelectasis. Left lung is relatively clear.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There is no
congestive failure.
.
[**2110-8-12**] echo:
INTERPRETATION: This 81 y/o man with a h/o CAD, CHF, COPD and
renal
failure s/p AAA repair was referred for evaluation of chest
pain. The
patient was infused with 0.142mg/kg/min of Persantine over 4
minutes. No
chest, neck, back or arm discomfort was reported by the patient
throughout the procedure. The EKG is uninterpretable for
ischemia in the
presence of a LBBB. The rhythm was sinus with rare isolated APDs
and
VPDs. Hemodynamic response to infusion was appropriate.
Post-infusion
during the IV injection of 125mg of Aminophylline, the patient
reported
dizziness with a palp blood pressure of 88/-mmHg. Patient was
immediately placed in the Trendelenburg position with a BP of
106/palp
and relief of dizziness.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms with uninterpretable EKG
changes.
Nuclear report sent separately.
.
CARDIAC PERFUSION PERSANTINE [**2110-8-19**]:
INTERPRETATION:
The image quality is adequate but limited due to activity
adjacent to the
heart.
Left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a fixed, moderate
reduction in photon counts involving the mid and basal inferior
and inferolateral walls.
Gated images reveal hypokinesis of the mid and basal inferior
and inferolateral walls. There is septal akinesis with normal
thickening, consistent with LBBB.
The remaining segments are mildly hypokinetic.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 30% with an
EDV of 78 ml.

IMPRESSION:
1. Fixed, medium-sized, moderate severity perfusion defect
involving the PDA territory.
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size. Severe systolic
dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral
walls. The
remaining segments are mildly hypokinetic.
Compared with the study of [**2104-10-6**], myocardial perfusion
appears similar.
Left ventricular systolic dysfunction has deteriorated.
.
STRESS TEST:
INTERPRETATION: This 81 y/o man with a h/o CAD, CHF, COPD and
renal
failure s/p AAA repair was referred for evaluation of chest
pain. The
patient was infused with 0.142mg/kg/min of Persantine over 4
minutes. No
chest, neck, back or arm discomfort was reported by the patient
throughout t
