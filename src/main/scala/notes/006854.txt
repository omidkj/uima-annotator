Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 26489**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, bacteremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
RIJ central line placement

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with chief complaint of fevers 103, foot
redness and pain, Podiatrist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],MDS, anemia of chronic
renal insufficiency, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. BUE Psuedogout,
also has cough with productive sputum. Daughter-[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1022**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Patient reports redness swelling at foot. Daughter was concerned
and brought patient to hospital given fever at home to 103 and
redness swelling.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.4 P90 BP 90/40 R16 O2 sat 100%
RA. Patient was given vanco/zosyn for toe infection. Patient
reported fevers, and cough at home with worsening redness at
foot. Initial exam notable for decreased breath sounds at bases,
guaiac positive brown stool, +erythema and warmth at R-great
toe. Was transiently hypotensive in ED with SBP as low as 78/30.
Was mentating well with that BP, however. Received 1.5L NS
(gentle given low EF), and R-IJ placed. Podiatry consulted who
felt patient would likely need amputation of great toe and this
was potential source for sepsis. Also received hydrocortisone
for stress dose steroids given h/o prednisone use in past. Cards
curbsided on patient for troponin of 0.35 (new from baseline).
Was c/p free in ED. ECG with new TWI in V2/V3 but otherwise
unchanged with baseline RBBB. Recommended against heparin.
.
Was seen by podiatry on [**2146-3-1**] and 2nd hallux was noted to be
w/o e/o infection.
.
On arrival to floor, was mentating well w/o pain or other
complaints.

TTE:
Suboptimal echo views.The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is probably mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
distal LV/apical akinesis. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. No valvular vegetations seen.

UE Doppler:
No DVT

CXR:
FINDINGS: A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained.
The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in appearance. There is
atherosclerotic disease of the aorta. Again noted is a
right-sided pacemaker
with two leads terminating in the right atrium and two leads
terminating in
the right ventricle. The lungs are clear bilaterally without
focal opacity
identified. The right costophrenic angle is not included on this
study. No
left pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The osseous
structures
are intact.

IMPRESSION:

No acute intrathoracic process.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o M w/ h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy, endocarditis,
cryptogenic cirrhosis, and MDS p/w cellulitis, severe sepsis and
demand ischemia.
.
#Severe Sepsis: Likely [**2-21**] to toe infection.  Other infectious
workup was negative including CXR, C diff toxin, UA, TTE,
influenza antigen. On [**3-8**] grew 2/2 blood cxs and superficial
wound culture grew Staph aureus.  Surveillance cultures were
subsequently negative.   He was treated with vancomycin for
possible MRSA.  He was given stress-dose steroids.  Podiatry
followed him and considered debridement but opted for
conservative management with outpatient follow-up for further.
Vascular surgery followed him.  ABIs showed mild bilateral
tibial disease.  TTE and TEE were negative for signs of
endocarditis.  When cultures grew methicillin-resistant staph
aureas, the ID team made the decision to treat with an extended
course of vancomycin until [**4-8**]. PICC was placed for this
purpose.  He will also complete a quick taper of steroids back
to his outpatient dose.
.
# Cirrhosis: Stable, no h/o ascites.  No suspicion for SBP
.
# Anemia/Myelodysplastic syndrome: Baseline Hct is 22-25,
transfusion dependent.  Transfused 3 units PRBC [**3-8**] and 2 units
[**3-9**].  Hct was subsequently stable.  PPI was continued.  He will
need to resume Aranesp (q2weekly) as an outpatient.
.
#Thrombocytopenia: Platelets were at baseline 40-60.
.
# CAD: Has h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy, and pacer.  Initial trop
bump likely [**2-21**] demand ischemia from anemia and sepsis
physiology.  Received 3 units PRBCs [**3-8**].  He ruled out for ACS
by enzymes.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Likely poor forward perfusion
and sepsis physiology.  Cr trended down towards baseline with
resuscitation.
.
# GAVE/Watermelon stomach:  PPI was continued; pRBC were given
as above.
.
# Diabetes: Not on diabetes medications as outpatient.
Fingersticks were elvated to the upper 100s in the setting of
stress dose steroids. He was given insulin sliding scale.
.
# Right upper extremity swelling:  Apparently chro
