Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Vitamin E / Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1384**]
Chief Complaint:
End stage liver disease

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation for mechanical ventilation
Laporatomy
Abdominal paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
55yoM Hep C etoh cirrhosis currently being evaluated for
transplant, s/p VATS for further w/u of SOB and pulmonary
nodules, presented on 2 days with generalized fatigue and mild
confusion, now transferred to MICU as per recs of liver
attending for worsening renal function and worsening mental
status. In ED on admission, no paracentesis performed, begun on
empiric azithro/ceftriaxone therapy for both SBP +/- infection
from left VATs discharge from previous admission. On floor,
noted to have worsening renal function with creatinine from 0.8
to 2.7 with urinary sodium 78, decreasing UOP.
Discharged [**3-22**], had VATS for "SOB" and "pulmonary nodules"
evaluation, has been feeling ill since this discharge. ROS prior
to admission was negative for CP, palps, cough, fever, chills,
diarrhea, dysuria, headache, vision changes, black tarry stools,
BRBPR, or hematemesis. Had noted increased LE edema as well as
increased abdominal girth, but no abdominal pain prior to
admission. On transfer, ROS essentially unchaged, difficult to
take a full ROS [**3-13**] mental status.
.
Now [**4-3**], pt readmitted from floor with increasing O2
requirements over the previous day, now on 6l nc to 8l face
mask. Vital signs stable, with sbp 120/70, rr 24. Pt received
40iv lasix x2 on floor, with total of 300cc UOP since 5am
through transfer at 3pm. CXR showing worsening pulmonary edema
since [**4-1**] cxr, suggestive of chf. Glucoses on floor elevated at
250-350. Vanco was started on floor [**4-2**] for concern for
pneumonia (given o2 requirement increase) as well as G+ coverage
L vats.


Past Medical History:
1. pulmonary nodules - BAL [**1-16**] which grew out [**Name (NI) 8974**] (unclear if
ever got treated)  ss/p recent lung biopsy

7. history of positive PPD.

Social History:
Lifetime nonsmoker, works in construction. He lives alone,
reportedly at the [**Company 3596**]. He was a previous heavy alcohol user,
but quit about 20 years ago and he notes exposure to asbestos.


Family History:
Mother who picked up some sort respiratory condition after
traveling to [**State 15946**] and his father has question of esophageal
cancer.

IMAGING:
[**2179-3-26**] HEAD CT:
This study is limited by motion artifact, despite repeat
acquisition. There is no evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or
hydrocephalus.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is grossly
preserved. Hypodensity in the periventricular white matter of
both cerebral hemispheres consistent with moderate chronic
microvascular infarction.  There is complete opacification of
the right frontal and right ethmoid sinuses.  The remaining
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear
normally aerated.  IMPRESSION: 1.  No evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage. 2.  Sinus disease, as described.

[**2179-3-26**] CXR:
Increased opacity of the left lower lung, at least in part due
to
increased loculated pleural fluid. Difficult to exclude
superimposed
consolidation. Increased pulmonary vascular engorgement,
suggesting
contribution of volume overload, but assessment of
cardiovascular status is also limited due to low lung volumes.

[**2179-3-26**] ABD US:
1.  Cirrhotic-appearing liver with small-to-moderate amount of
ascites. Patent portal vein.
2.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
3.  Splenomegaly

[**2179-3-28**] TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial
effusion most prominent along the inferolateral wall of the left
ventricle and around the right atrium with minimal effusion
anterior to the left and right ventricles. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2178-12-15**], the pericardial effusion
is new.

[**2179-4-5**] TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%) The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-3-28**], the effusion is now
small.

[**2179-4-11**] RENAL US:
1.  No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2.  Marked splenomegaly and ascites.

[**2179-4-11**] PERITONEAL FLUID: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.


Brief Hospital Course:
END STAGE LIVER DISEASE
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 39505**] has cirrhosis and a history of HCV and HBV.
Unfortunately this hospital course was complicated by hepatic
encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome and spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis.  He was initially admitted on [**2179-3-26**] after a VATS
on [**2179-3-19**] for evaluation of pulmonary nodules and SOB; he
presented with fatigue and malaise and was admitted to the floor
for presumptive SBP and pneumonia. He had three transfers from
the floor to the MICU throughout his hospitalization.  The first
was on 2//08 for worsening mental status and renal failure.  The
second ICU adission was on 2//08 for hypoxemic respiratory
failure
