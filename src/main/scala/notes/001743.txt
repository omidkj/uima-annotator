HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85 year old
female with coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis,
congestive heart failure, asthma, status post recent
hospitalization for pulmonary edema and pneumonia, presenting
one day after discharge with the chief complaint of increased
nursing home.  A chest x-ray was done showing a new right
upper lobe infiltrate and progression of an old right lower
lobe infiltrate.  The patient was intubated on [**2106-10-15**], for
respiratory distress, with oxygen saturation in the 70% range
on three liters nasal cannula, with an arterial blood gas
showing pH 7.17, pCO2 86, pO2 65 on 100% nonrebreather.  The
patient was extubated on [**2106-10-17**], without complications and
arterial blood gases prior to transfer to the medical floor
was on [**2106-10-16**], showing a pH of 7.40, pCO2 48, pO2 111.

On the general medical floor, the patient had a chief
complaint of sore throat which she blamed on intubation.
Otherwise, the patient did not report any shortness of
breath.

patient was an elderly Russian female in no acute distress.
Head and neck examination - The pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements
are intact.  The oropharynx is clear.  There is no jugular
venous distention, lymphadenopathy or carotid bruits.

radiation to the neck.  No gallops.  Lungs - Bilateral
wheezes and crackles.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Normal bowel
sounds.  Extremities - No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 1+
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

hematocrit 30.5, platelets 353,000.  Prothrombin time 20.2,
partial thromboplastin time 39.7, INR 3.8.  Sodium 139,
potassium 3.3, chloride 100, bicarbonate 32, blood urea
nitrogen 9, creatinine 0.7, glucose 118.  Last arterial blood
gases on [**2106-10-16**], revealed pH 7.4, pCO2 48, pO2 111.  Sputum

polymorphonuclear leukocytes, less than 10 epithelial cells,
3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters, 1+ gram

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was an 85 year old female with
coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, congestive
heart failure, asthma, status post recent hospitalization for
pulmonary edema, pneumonia, presenting one day after
discharge from recent hospitalization with shortness of
breath and desaturations.  The patient was found to have
progressive infiltrates on chest x-ray consistent with a
persistent pneumonia, probably an aspiration pneumonia.

1.  Infectious disease - The patient was continued on a two
week course of Levofloxacin and Flagyl, and a seven day
course of Vancomycin.  As the patient had worsening pulmonary
status during her hospital stay, the Levofloxacin and Flagyl
were continued beyond a two week course and Cefepime was
added for broad coverage. As the patient's clinical status
deteriorated and the patient was made DNR/DNI and then
comfort measures only, her antibiotics were discontinued on
[**2106-11-2**], as the patient only had a single lumen PICC line
and was on intravenous Morphine for pain control and comfort.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient had a history of pulmonary edema
and was admitted with a multilobar pneumonia, presumed
secondary to aspiration.  The patient was continued on
antibiotics with triple therapy (Levofloxacin, Flagyl and
Cefepime which was added later on for broadening coverage).
The patient had multiple episodes of desaturation when
transferred to the general medical floor which initially were
relieved by administering Lasix intravenous in addition to
small doses of Morphine Sulfate for treating episodes of
pulmonary edema which were presumed to be causing these
frequent episodes of shortness of breath.  On [**2106-10-29**], the
patient experienced an episode of desaturation to 88% on five
liters after which an oxygen face tent was placed, with mild
improvement in oxygen saturation to 93%.  A chest x-ray was
obtained which revealed right lung collapse.  The patient was
subsequently placed on a 100% face mask and was saturating 88
to 92%.  The patient was then placed on BiPAP with
reinflation of the right lung.  However, the patient
persisted to remain on 100% face mask.  As the patient
refused subsequent BiPAP, the patient was continued on
conservative measures for the remainder of her hospital
course to manage her respiratory condition.  The patient was
continued on oxygen, nebulizers p.r.n., and was positioned on
her left side to promote blood flow to the good lung.

3.  Cardiovascular - Coronary artery disease - The patient
had left main disease which was inoperable.  As the patient
had in the past experienced severe hypotension with nitrates,
nitrates were avoided.  The patient was continued on beta
blockade.  The patient was given Morphine Sulfate
intermittently for relief of ischemic pain.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - The patient was initially on
Lopressor, Procainamide and low dose Diltiazem with good
control of her heart rate.  However, the patient's
subsequently started experiencing intermittent episodes of
atrial fibrillation to a heart rate of 120s, which were
initially well controlled with intermittent boluses of
intravenous Lopressor.

During the hospital course, the patient developed a wide
complex tachycardia, and the electrophysiology service was
consulted to see whether the patient could have her pacer
adjusted so that the ventricles would not be paced at the
same rate as her atria during episodes of atrial
fibrillation.  The electrophysiology service simply suggested
continuing Procainamide and Lopressor at their current doses,
with adjustment of Procainamide to keep the Q-Tc interval
less than 500.  With further difficulty controlling the
patient's heart rate, the patient was placed on a Diltiazem
drip.  This was later changed to the oral form in interest of
intravenous access.

Congestive heart failure - The patient was given Lasix
intravenous standing dose and Lasix intravenous p.r.n. for
episodes of interval pulmonary edema during hospital stay.

4.  Gastrointestinal - The patient was placed on aggressive
bowel regimen.  The patient was initially on tube feeds
through nasogastric tube.  However, at one point during the
hospital course, tube feeds
