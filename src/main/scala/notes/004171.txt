Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] found to have extensive right sided
subdural, IPH and subarachnoid blood.  The family agreed to have
surgery for right sided craniotomy despite poor prognosis.
During the surgery they were found to have large blood
collection and brain parenchyma was mottled and brain was
pulsatile.
Post operatively she was found to localize her right upper
extremity to pain and no movement of left upper extremity.  She
withdrew her lower extremities.
Post operative CT showed:  1. Status post right frontal
craniotomy and evacuation of mixed density subdural hematoma.
Mild interval improvement in subfalcine herniation. Large
quantity of subarachnoid hemorrhage seen bilaterally within the
frontal and temporal region, right greater than left, grossly
unchanged.
2. Bifrontal lobe hemorrhagic contusions, left greater than
right, and right anterior temporal lobe hemorrhagic contusions,
small to moderate in size, all of which are unchanged.
She had a questionable mild L2 compression fracture which was
cleared by the spine service.

On post operative day 1 her exam she withdrew her lower
extremities to pain and had no movement of her upper
extremities.  On post op day 2 she began to have spontaneous
movement of her right upper extremity.  She was loaded with
Dilantin and level was kept above 10 during her time in the ICU
She began spiking fevers on post op day 4 eventual cultures
found staph coag negative in her blood and enterococcus in her
urine she was started on a 10 day course of Vancomycin.

A head CT on [**6-7**] was notable for Evolving small posterior
cerebral artery - anterior cerebral artery border zone infarct
seen superiorly along the medial aspect of the right cerebral
convexity. Slight decrease in size of hemorrhagic contusions,
bilateral subdural hematomas and quantity of subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

The patient was noted to begin to open eyes and questionably
follow commands with RUE in Italian on POD [**5-20**], family reports
after [**6-12**] she did not follow any further commands in Italian.

There were discussion with family regarding extubation and
placing of PEG tubes.  General family consenus was to extubate
and not reintubate which occured on [**6-14**].  CXRs showed possible R
lower lobe pneumonia and CHF.
On [**6-16**] she was transferred to the floor she continued to have
fevers.  Her staples from her head wound were DC'd with no sign
of infection.  Her foley catheter was d/c'd she continued on
Vancomycin and tube feeds while the family decided on type of
placement and agressiveness of care.  At this point they want
active medical problems treated and do not want a PEG tube.  A
pallative care consult was placed. The family expressed a desire
for minimally invasive procedures, if necessary, however they
did not want any aggressive measures performed.
A medicine consult was called to address patient's intermittent
fevers as well as elevated blood sugars. Her fixed dose insulin
and slifding scale adjusted accordingly. She is on Vancomaycin
last dose will be on [**2181-6-24**]. Her chest radiographs showed
some left lower lobe consalidation medicine team recommended to
add Levo and flagyl which is started on [**2181-6-21**], should be
continued total of 10 days rom strat date. She was continued on
antibiotics and at the time of discharge, remained afebrile. She
was maintained on tube feeds via a dobhoff tube which did need
to be replaced multiple times secondary to the patient
self-dc'ing the tube.
She remained stable and was discharged on POD 16 in stable
condition.
