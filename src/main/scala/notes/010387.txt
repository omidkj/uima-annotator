Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Carboplatin / Ibuprofen

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 158**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2124-4-12**]: Exploratory laparotomy with extended right colectomyand
end ileostomy


History of Present Illness:
59yo G0 with metastatic papillary serous ovarian CA transferred
from OSH. Pt initially presented to OSH on [**4-10**] with abdominal
pain, distention, constipation (last BM [**4-6**]), increased
belching.  Pain started as vague discomfort, but progressed to
pain throughout that was sharp, intermittent, exacerbated by
movement.  She was unable to tolerate PO at the time that she
presented to OSH.  At the referring institution, she had a CT
scan with PO contrast which demonstrated small bowel
pneumatosis. She was transferred to the Gyn-Onc service for
further care. The colorectal surgical service was consulted for
the radiologic findings, she was made NPO, had NGT placed with
return of bilious fluid.  Given a WBC of 1.9 (37% bands), she
was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics (ertapenem and
levofloxacin) because of concern for sepsis, but eventually
transitioned to vanc/zosyn.  Admission labs were also
significant for Cr 1.8, AST 49, and ALT 30. Pt then underwent
exploratory-laparotomy on [**4-12**].

Past Medical History:
Past Medical History:
-Recurrent metastatic ovarian CA s/p TAH/BSO debulking and
chemo. She was initially diagnosed with stage IIC ovarian cancer
at the time of exploratory laparotomy on [**2118-7-19**].  She received
carboplatin and Taxol therapy [**2118-8-19**] until [**2118-11-28**].  She was
noted to have rising CA-125 up to 117 in [**1-31**].  CT scan showed
no convincing areas of disease.  The patient underwent
laparoscopic evaluation by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] where multiple tiny
peritoneal implants were seen and biopsy was consistent with
recurrent adenocarcinoma ovarian primary.  CA-125 rose to 185
and she was initiated on carboplatin in [**3-30**].  Following three
cycles, she developed carboplatin allergy and was switched to
Doxil, which she received from [**2120-5-6**] until [**7-30**]. She was then
started on Arimidex in [**8-30**]. She had been stable until [**4-30**] when
she developed abominal pain, concern for acute appendicitis, and
underwent lap appy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**] which revealed several
carcinoma implants along both hemidiaphragms, the right lobe of
the liver, and the lower abdomen on the sigmoid colon and
appendix; she also had a small amount of ascites.

IMAGING:
-[**4-11**] KUB: 1. No overt radiologic evidence of small-bowel
obstruction or ileus 2. Nasoenteric tube with the tip likely
projecting over the region consistent with body of the stomach.

-[**4-13**] CXR:1. New moderately large left and small right pleural
effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis. 2. Satisfactory
position of peripherally inserted central venous catheter.

-[**4-13**] Renal U/S: No evidence of hydronephrosis in bilateral
kidneys.

-[**4-16**] CXR: Increased density at the left base consistent with
parenchymal
consolidation. Bilateral pleural effusions may obscure the
underlying
pulmonary opacities. There is no definite change.

-[**4-21**] CT ABD &Pelvis: 1. Partially rim-enhancing fluid
collection within the anterior midline abdomen in close
proximity to the transverse colon surgical chain sutures.
Underlying superinfection cannot be excluded and the collection
is amenable to needle aspiration if needed.  2. No findings of
bowel obstruction or leak. Persistent but slightly improved
edematous appearance of the remaining large bowel when compared
to the outside [**2124-4-11**] exam. 3. Nonspecific enhancement
and fluid in the right paracolic gutter. While this may
represent post-procedural change, underlying peritoneal disease
is also possible in this patient with known metastatic disease.
4. Renal cysts including a hyperdense cyst off the left lower
pole. 5. Bibasilar atelectasis with small left pleural effusion.


-[**4-23**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**4-16**], the right base
shows substantial clearing with moderate atelectatic streaking
and probable small effusion. On the left, however, there is
still extensive opacification consistent with pleural effusion,
atelectasis, and possibly supervening pneumonia in the
appropriate clinical setting.

-[**4-24**] CT abd: 1. Slight interval decrease in size to partially
organized intra-abdominal fluid collection within the midline
abdomen which is of higher density today and may suggest
decreasing phlegmon or evolving hematoma. A small amount of air
within this collection is likely related to recent attempted
aspiration. No new fluid collections or extraluminal oral
contrast is present. 2. Persistent edema and wall thickening
involving the visualized large bowel, most pronounced in the
region of the splenic flexure. Slight interval worsening of
small bowel wall thickening and mesenteri
