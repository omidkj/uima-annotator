RADIOLOGY  Final Report

[**2143-11-19**] 10:02 AM

CT ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W&W/O C

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images were obtained through the
abdomen and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast.
Coronal and sagittal reformations were displayed with 5-mm
slice-thickness and used for better anatomical localization.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A small
hyperdense fluid collection is identified starting just inferior
to the left renal lower pole in the retroperitoneum and
extending down to the pelvic brim just superior to where the
iliacus muscle begins. This likely represents a small hematoma,
likely related to recent left retroperitoneal surgical
dissection. The liver displays no focal masses. The patient is
status post cholecystectomy. There is a grossly unchanged
appearance to a slightly prominent common bile duct and very
minimal intrahepatic biliary dilatation. No ductal stones are
identified and the pancreatic duct is also mildly prominent. The
spleen, stomach, intraabdominal bowel, and kidneys appear
grossly normal. Again identified is prominence of the adrenal
glands bilaterally, the left adrenal gland lesion appears to be
a benign adenoma and the right adrenal lesion is indeterminate,
but likely benign. The patient is status post removal of
previous left aortofemoral bypass graft and left femoral
popliteal bypass graft. Since prior examination, there has been
interval placement of a left common iliac and external iliac
artery stent. The right aortofemoral bypass graft appears patent
and again displays areas of focal thickening as noted on prior
CT examination. There is no free air or pathologically enlarged
abdominal lymphadenopathy identified. There are diffuse coronary
and aortic calcifications.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is marked
stranding of the subcutaneous tissues, likely from prior surgery
as well as multiple hyperattenuating soft tissue lesions, likely
related to subcutaneous injections. Superior to the left
external iliac artery prior to its formation of the left common
femoral artery, there is an ill-defined 2.3 x 2.5 cm pocket of
fluid collection with multiple pockets of air bubbles. This was
not noted on prior examination and may represent a normal
post-surgical fluid collection, surgi-seal, or an early abscess.
Other small pockets of fluid collection are noted more distally
within the left thigh. Multiple surgical drains are identified.
The distal arteries are difficult to evaluate in terms of
patency due to the limits of this study, however, the left
common femoral and profunda branches appear patent and the left
SFA appears diffusely diseased with no gross contrast noted
within the vessel. A Foley is present in the bladder along with
a small pocket of air. The uterus, adnexa, rectum, and sigmoid
colon appear otherwise unremarkable. Note is made of a slightly
enlarged left inguinal lymph node measuring approximately 1.8 x
1.4 cm, likely reactive. No pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph
nodes are identified. There is trace free fluid noted within the
pelvic cavity.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious blastic or lytic lesions are
identified. Again identified are changes likely related to a
prior right inferior pubic ramus fracture. There are
degenerative changes of the spine.

IMPRESSION:

1. Small left-sided retroperitoneal hyperdense fluid
collection/hematoma. Likely related to recent surgical
dissection within this area.

2. Bilateral pleural effusions and compression atelectasis.

3. Unchanged prominence to common bile duct after
cholecystectomy.

4. Small focal fluid collection anterior to the left external
iliac artery with air bubbles. [**Month (only) 116**] represent area of recent
surgicel use an infected collection cannot be excluded.

5. Left adrenal adenoma with indeterminant right adrenal lesion.

6. Status post removal of left aortofemoral bypass graft and
left femoral popliteal bypass graft with interval placement of
left common and external iliac stents, unable to definitively
assess patency of distal vessels on this non- angiographic CT.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **]  presented to us complaining of fevers from
recurrent infected L. fem-BK-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass graft with bacteremia
due to pseudomonas, proteus and MRSA.

She was evaluated by the Vascular surgery department and found
to have infected L aorto femoral limb and left fem-bk [**Doctor Last Name **] bypass
grafts.

Pan cx'd / ID consulted / IV antibiotics

Followed by [**Hospital **] Clinic

She was admitted and consented for surgery. On [**2143-11-15**], she was
prepped and brought down to the operating room for surgery.

PROCEDURE:
1.  Removal of infected aortofemoral limb and the left fem-
    [**Doctor Last Name **] bypass grafts.
2.  Left common femoral artery endarterectomy and patch
    angioplasty with arm vein.
3.  Left the popliteal patch angioplasty with arm vein.
4.  Left common iliac artery and external iliac artery
    recanalization with balloon angioplasty and stenting.
    Completion arteriograms.

Intra-operatively, she was closely monitored and remained
hemodynamically stable. She tolerated the procedure well without
any difficulty or complication.

Post-operatively, she was extubated and transferred to the PACU
for further stabilization and monitoring.

She was then transferred to the floor for further recovery.

On the floor, she remained hemodynamically stable with her
