Service: SURGERY

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. right-sided thoracentesis [**2194-1-3**]
2. left-sided thoracentesis [**2194-1-4**]
3. right chest tube placement [**2194-1-6**]
4. right subclavian CVL [**2194-1-6**], replaced [**2194-1-12**]
5. trach/PEG [**2194-1-10**]

History of Present Illness:
77F s/p fall from standing; initially seen at OSH; she
reportedly became agitated when a c-collar was placed, and
required sedation, and was subsequently intubated for
respiratory distress.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.  Her injuries noted were a C7 fracture, and
chronic-appearing bilateral pleural effusions.

Past Medical History:
1. CHF
2. AF
3. HTN
4. NHL
5. ?radiation treatment to thyroid

Pertinent Results:
[**2194-1-1**] CT cspine: 1. Acute fracture involving the superior
endplate of C7 vertebral body with approximately 2 mm of
retropulsion of the posterior cortex without significant canal
stenosis.  2. Degenerative disease with facet changes as
described above. Widening at C3-4 on the right is likely
chronic. 3. Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectatic changes
are better assessed on corresponding CT torso performed
concurrently."

[**2194-1-2**] ECHO: "Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild calcific aortic stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension."

[**2194-1-2**]: "1. C7 compression fracture and T2 horizontal vertebral
body fracture without evidence of ligamentous injury or cord
injury."

[**2194-1-4**] BAL: MSSA 10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..


Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro: Identified C7 fracture on imaging; she was placed in a
[**Location (un) 2848**]-J collar.  A spine consult was obtained and recommended
that she remain in the collar until they would be able to
examine her clinically (off sedation).  An MR was also obtained.
 She was switched to a softer collar that allowed for slightly
more flexion.  She is to remain in the collar until follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] on roughly [**2194-1-20**] for reevaluation.

She was sedated with propofol, but alert and oriented.  A
geriatrics consult was obtained -- her nighttime agitation was
subsequently managed with Seroquel 25mg QHS.

CV: An ECHO on [**1-2**] did not demonstrate significant cardiac
abnormalities.  Mild aortic stenosis was noted.  She was
maintained on her home beta blocker dose.  She did require
neosynephrine while on propofol, which was given while intubated
and post-intubation for agitation. Geriatrics was consulted and
suggested giving seroquel 12 mg qhs for agitation instead.

Resp: In contact with her PCP who noted that her pleural
effusions were chronic.  We attempted extubation on Hd #2, but
she developed tachypnea and respiratory distress and was
reintubated.  It was thought that her pleural effusions may have
contributed to her respiratory compromise, and she had a right
and left-sided thoracentesis on Hd #3 and 4 (respectively).
Extubation was attempted a 2nd time, but again, she quickly
failed after an hour, and was once again reintubated.  A CVL was
also placed at this time -- on imaging, she was noted to have
persistent right pleural effusion and a small apical
pneumothorax.  Given concern that she had respiratory distress
upon extubation, and was now currently on positive pressure
ventilation, a 20Fr chest tube was placed in her right side.
Pleural fluid analyses demonstrated a transudative fluid, which
was not infected.  Follwoing the chest tube placement, a 3rd
extubation was attempted, but she again required reintubation.
At this point, there was concern that there may be an anatomic
component to her respiratory failure -- Interventional Pulmonary
was asked to evaluate the patient's airways.  Her son had given
a vague history of a possible prior tracheostomy, and radiation
to her neck -- perhaps causing some tracheal stenosis.  On
bronchoscopy, close evaluation demonstrated upper airway edema,
with no leak when the cuff was down.  She was placed on
steroids, but given these findings, the decision was made to
proceed with a trach/peg, expecting a longer than expected
vent-dependence.  She had her trach/PEG on [**2194-1-10**]. On [**1-11**] she
had a episode of desaturation to the 80s for which she underwent
another bronchoscopy that revealed thick brown sputum. She was
placed on Vancomycin and Zosyn empirically until sputum cultures
and BAL returned negative.

At the time of discharge, she was tolerating increase intervals
on trach mask and off the vent.

GI: She received tube feeds through a dobhoff tube, then through
her PEG tube. On [**1-11**] she had several loose stools and the tube
feedings were held. Stool cultures x 2 were sent and found to be
negative. Tube feedings were restarted on [**1-13**].

Heme: She is on Coumadin at home for her history of atrial
fibrillation; she was maintained on a heparin drip while in the
unit until she became therapeutic.

GU: She maintained a stable creatinine and adequate urine
output.

ID: A [**1-4**] BAL demonstrated only 10^4 organisms of MSSA -- she
was, however, on steroids, and the ICU team placed her on
Levofloxacin. On [**1-11**] she had an episode of desaturation and a
bronch revealed thick brown mucous. She was placed on empiric
Vancomycin, Zosyn for three days until cultures returned
negative. On [**1-11**] she also had an episode of hypotension
concerning for septic physiology. Labs drawn at the time showed
WBC = 29. Blood cultures were still negative at 4 days out.

Endocr: She received a 48 hour course of dexamethasone for her
supraglottic swelling, in hopes that this would improve her
chances of extubation.  These were discontinued following her
tracheostomy.
