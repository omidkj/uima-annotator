CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Elevated creatinine.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  58 year old female status post
cadaver renal transplant on [**2198-1-18**], seen in the
office by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**1-29**].  Noted a little incision infection,
transplant incision infection treated with Keflex x seven
days.  The patient was followed on an outpatient basis and
noted to have an elevated creatinine on [**2198-2-1**] - the
creatinine was 3.3 and the Prograf level was 22.  The Prograf
level dose was reduced from 3 mg twice a day to 2 mg twice a
day.  On [**2-5**], the patient's creatinine was noted to be 5.1,
with a Prograf level of 16.4.  The patient was admitted to
the transplant unit for further evaluation of elevated
creatinine.

Review of systems included the patient denying fevers,
chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, cough,
cold.  No change in bowel habits.  No melena, no bright red
blood per rectum, though poor p.o. intake.  Patient without
explanation why.  No nausea or vomiting.  No dysuria, though
the patient reported persistent hematuria.  The patient
reports moderate pain from incision, with persistent of
erythema.  Family reports yellow drainage from wound.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for end stage renal
disease on hemodialysis, secondary to ANCA
glomerulonephritis, scleroderma, hypertension, coronary
artery disease status post myocardial infarction x two,
status post LAD stent, congestive heart failure with ejection
fraction of 30 percent, peripheral vascular disease, right
upper lung mass, chronic, history of MAC.  History of gastric
erosions and anemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for chronic cadaver renal
transplant on [**2198-1-18**].  Also cadaver renal transplant in [**2189**]
which failed.  History of total abdominal hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, history of cholecystectomy
and a repair of a left femoral aneurysm, and peritoneal
dialysis catheter with repositioning x 2 and a right A-V
fistula.

Socially, the patient lives at home with family, continues to
smoke.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Prograf 2 mg p.o. b.i.d.
CellCept [**Pager number **] mg p.o. b.i.d.
Bactrim single strength one daily.
Nystatin q.i.d.
Valcide 450 mg q.o.d.
Protonix 40 mg once a day.
Coreg 3.125 mg twice a day.
Albuterol inhaler p.r.n.

The patient was admitted, received initial intravenous fluid
hydration, and ultrasound was obtained on [**2-5**].  Ultrasound
of the right kidney transplant revealed mild hydronephrosis,
which was new compared to [**2198-1-23**].  Resistive indices at the
lower and interpolar regions of the transplant kidney
approached 1, with waveforms demonstrating good systolic
upstroke with virtually no diastolic flow.  This was an acute
change compared to the prior exam.  It was noted that at the
upper pole of the transplanted kidney, the resistive index
was 0.8.  Nephrology was consulted.  The patient was seen by
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and it was decided that a kidney biopsy
would be obtained.  This was done on [**2-6**], and the patient
was not given any Prograf on hospital day one, and the
Prograf was held on hospital day two in the morning.  This
was re-started on hospital day two for a level of 18.1.
Prograf was resumed at one mg p.o. b.i.d.

Biopsy results returned significant for acute cellular
rejection. The patient was initiated on ATG.  The patient was
also initiated on 500 mg of Solu-Medrol.  She received three
doses of ATG on separate days.  Her white count did trend
down to 3.5.  It was noted on hospital day five that the
patient's crit was low at 25.4.  She was ordered for one unit
of packed red blood cells.  Just after this infusion, the
patient was noted to be acutely short of breath.  She was
sitting up in bed using accessory muscles on a scoop mask,
looking uncomfortable.  Vital signs were as follows:
Temperature 96.2, heart rate 84, blood pressure 176/84,
respiratory rate 28, oxygen saturation on three liters 92
percent.  She had bilateral diffuse crackles anteriorly and
posteriorly.  Cardiovascularly, the heart rate was regular,
with a normal S1 and S2 without any murmurs.  There was no
pedal edema.  Lasix IV 40 mg x 1 was given.  A chest x-ray
was ordered stat, and an EKG was done as well.

The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for
respiratory distress.  Her chest x-ray result revealed
pulmonary edema  Her EKG was normal.  Initial ABG's were
7.09, 100, 58, 19 and negative 12.  Upon transfer to the
SICU, the patient was briefly unresponsive until arrival in
the SICU, where she was cyanotic.  She was bagged and her
oxygen saturation was 72 and came up to 100 percent with the
bag breathing.  Anesthesia was called stat to intubate the
patient.  The patient had vomited a small amount after
becoming unresponsive.  Once the patient was intubated
successfully, the patient was suctioned for a copious amount
of sputum, and the sputum was frothy.  The patient was
ventilated, and further intravenous Lasix was given.  The ATG
infusion was stopped.  Hematocrit was stable.  Vital signs
were stable, and labs were as follows:  Sodium 141, potassium
3.9, chloride 106, CO2 20, BUN 47, creatinine 3.

The patient did receive cardiac enzymes that were as follows:
Troponin 0.31, CK-MB 17, MBI 10.8.  Cardiology recommended
that the patient receive a transesophageal echocardiogram to
evaluate heart function.  She was placed on a nitroglycerin
drip as well, given the elevated enzymes, and serial enzymes
were drawn.  She was further diuresed, and gradually her
urine output picked up.  The ATG was resumed.  She was given
a further transfusion of packed red blood cells for a crit of
27.  This was followed by some intravenous Lasix.  Urine
output continued to improve.  The patient was weaned from the
ventilator with stable vital signs and respiratory function.
She remained in the intensive care unit for three days, and
was transferred back to the medical-surgical floor on
hospital day eight.  She continued to get ATG, for a total of
seven days.  She received a tapering dose of Solu-Medrol, and
was initiated on prednisone on the day of discharge to 10 mg.
That will be further tapered.  Urine output improved to a
liter and a half per day.  Creatinine trended down to 1.5 on
day of discharge on [**2-14**].

LABS ON DISCHARGE ([**2-14**]):  Creatinine 1.5, BUN 32, sodium
138, potassium 4.5, chloride 103, CO2 28, glucose 175.  Of
note, her glucose ranged from a low of 117 to a high of 215.

During intensive care unit, she received insulin drip.  This
was converted to a sliding scale when she was back on the
medical-surgical unit, and this was given intermittently
based on her lowered prednisone dose.  She was discharged
without insulin, and she will be followed in the outpatient
clinic to monitor the hyperglycemia induced by steroids.  She
may benefit by an oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**].

Also of note, white blood cell count was improved upon
discharge, with a white blood cell count of 3.9.  It had
trended down to a low of 1.7.  Her hematocrit was 31.6 on day
of discharge.  Vital signs were stable.  She was tolerating
diet.  No respiratory distress, with clear lung sounds.  She
was switched from carvedilol per Cardiology recommendations,
and placed on Lopressor to beta block her, and also received
a nitroglycerin patch.  This was converted on day of
discharge to Imdur 30 mg.

Her echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of 25-30
percent.  The left atrium was normal in size.  There was mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size.  There was severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, with near akinesis of the distal half of the
anterior septum and the anterior walls and distal inferior
walls.  The apex is mildly dyskinetic.  No masses or thrombi
were seen in the left ventricle.  The right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion were normal.  The aortic
valve leaflets, three of them, appeared structurally normal,
with good leaflet excur
