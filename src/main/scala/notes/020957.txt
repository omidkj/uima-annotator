History of Present Illness:
HPI: 75M w/ prostate cancer s/p XRT two yrs ago, CAD (s/p BMS x3
to ramus [**2178**], DES x2 to RCA in [**11/2180**]) on ASA and Plavix,
chronic systolic CHF (EF 35-50%), p/w BRBPR. Pt was in his usual
state of health until last evening when following dinner he had
loose brown stools covered in bright red blood which turned the
entire toilet bowl red. No dark/tarry stool. The pt denied
lightheadedness, abdominal pain, rectal pain, SOB, palpitations.

He has no h/o diverticulosis or hemorrhoids or any GI bleed in
the past. Wife says he does strain to have bowel movements but
patient denies. Says he had normal cscope 2 yrs ago at [**Location (un) 16824**].

HR 80 BP 120/75, Sitting HR 80 BP 118/70, Standing HR 75 BP
115/75. No abdominal tenderness. No hemorrhoids visible
externally but he has a small 1cm firm growth near his anus
(old/unchanged per Pt). Rectal exam: small amount of gross
blood, no obvious hemorrhoid or fissure, no tenderness. While in
the ED the pt underwent anoscopy that revealed internal
hemorrhoids seen but none that are visibly bleeding; when
inserted can see friable tissue that is bloody with blood clot.
Labs in ED notable for Hct 31.8 (baseline 40 in [**11/2180**]), Cr 1.2

bleeding.

[**7-27**] CTA Abdomen + Pelvis: No source for active bleeding
localized. Embolization coil demonstrated in good position along
the ileocolic distribution. Vessels are demonstrated to be
peripheral to this point, likely related to collateralization.
The patient is status post aortobiiliac stent placement. Pleural
plaques indicative of prior asbestos exposure. Colonic
diverticulosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
75M with hx of prostate CA, CAD s/p BMS x3 in [**11-29**], chronic
systolic CHF here with two days of BRBPR that was admitted with
a large acute LGIB thought to be diverticular in etiology.
Hospital course notable for 2 ICU stays.
.
ACUTE ISSUES:
# Diverticular LGIB:  Pt was admitted with LGIB. On day 3 while
being prepped for colonoscopy the pt had an acute GIB and was
brought to the unit. The situation was discussed with his
outpatient cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who recommended
discontinuing plavix but continuing aspirin.  He was re-started
on aspirin 325 mg/day but this was stopped again when he
re-bled.  As above, ultimately, the source was found to be a
solitary cecal bleed found by a tagged RBC scan.  He was treated
with blood transfusions, and ultimately IR deployed 2 coils to a
branch of the ileocolic artery.  His bleeding stopped after this
procedure, but upon tranfer to the general medicine service on
the evening of [**2181-7-26**] he again began to have hematochezia. He
underwent a CTA on [**2181-7-27**] that showed no evidence of
extravasation. He was transferred back to the ICU, where Hcts
were stable 30-32. Follow-up colonoscopy to assess for source of
persistent bleeding was was planned for [**2181-7-31**]. Colonoscopy did
not show any active bleeding or any source of bleeding but
revealed diffuse diverticulosis L>R. At time of transfer to
floor, the pt had received a total of 23U PRBC (last [**2181-7-28**]), 2U
platelets, and 4 U FFP. He was on a protonix drip which was
transitioned to 40mg IV daily. The patient was discharged on
[**8-2**] on ASA 81mg, plavix was held after discussing this with his
outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] via email.
.
# CAD: s/p two DES in [**2180-11-20**]. Plavix was discontinued;
aspirin was continued, then stopped when he re-bled. After IR
embolization procedure, pt was tachycardic and hypertensive for
a brief period of time, EKG was performed with ST-depressions in
V3-4, which was felt to be demand ischemia in the setting of low
HCT (trop 0.03, 0.04, 0.06). He was transfused again to a goal
of 28-30 (in the setting of possible ischemia) with resolution
of his EKG findings. Follow-up EKG showed stable TWI in III,
aVF, V4-V6, no ST segment elevation, cardiac enzymes: CK-MG
negative x2, trop 0.06 x3. Pt denied chest pain on day of
discharge from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. His ASA was discontinued in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] given
that the patient re-bled. His Plavix continues to be held. His
home statin was resumed on day of discharge from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. The pt
did not have CP throughout his admission.
.
# Chronic Systolic CHF: EF 35%. Pt was euvolemic on admission.
His antihypertensives (beta blockers, [**Last Name (un) **]) were both held early
on during his admission given his hypotension in the setting of
bleeding.  He was started back on half his home lopressor after
successful IR intervention, and was restarted on his home
carvedilol at half dose upon transfer to the floor. When he
began bleeding again and was transferred back to the ICU, his
Metoprolol was held and his Carvedilol was continued. BPs ran
high in the ICU in the setting of holding metoprolol,
140s-160s/80s-90s, HR 70s. On discharge

# Aortic thrombus: "Small aortic thrombus," noted by radiology
on abdominal CTA, thought to be unlikely to be clinically
significant.
