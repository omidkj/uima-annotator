Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 87027**] is a 55 yo female with history of [**Known lastname 14165**] cell disease
and pulmonary embolus, not on anticoagulation, who presented to
OSH w/ pleuritic CP and worsening dyspnea on exertion. She was
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**], where she was found to have
bilateral subsegmental pulmonary emboli and acute chest
syndrome. It was recommended that she not be on anticoagulation
by the consulting Hematology team, out of thought that the
pulmonary emboli were chronic. Patient reports one week of
increasing shortness of breath, non-productive cough, chest pain
and fatigue. She reports that she got in her car following an
errand earlier today and fell asleep in her car. She was found
in her car by the police, complaining of chest pain and dyspnea.
She was initially presented to [**Hospital6 33**] and refused
treatment, including central access, requesting to be
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Int the ED, initial vitals were [**9-23**] pain, T 98.2, P 84, BP
106/84, R 20, Sat 100% 10L, O2 sat 73% RA on arrival. At [**Hospital1 18**],
patient is refusing blood draws and IV initially after multiple
attempts, but a 22 gauge IV was able to be placed. She has had
persistent chest pain since this afternoon. Labs were
significant for WBC count 13.6K with 70% neutrophils, hematocrit
of 26.2, which is at baseline, and reticulocyte count of 24.0.
Troponin was 0.06. D-dimer was 5382. Lactate was 1.8. ECG showed
deep T-wave inversions in anterior leads. Cardiology saw the
patient in the ED, and recommended no acute intervention.
Patient was not given aspirin due to allergy. Patient had
received Lovenox in the early afternoon at the OSH for presumed
PE. Patient refused CTA and chest X-ray. Patient was given
promethazine 25 mg x 2 for nausea, and she was administered
levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1. One set of blood cultures was drawn.
She was given nalbuphine 10 mg x 1. She was unable to be weaned
off of facemask, becoming hypoxic to the mid-70s, and it was
decided to admit the patient to the ICU. Vitals prior to
transfer were 98.5, 104/65, 84, 26. 96% NRB at 10L (o2sat drops
if pt takes off mask).
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient still reports some chest
discomfort but improved dyspnea. She reports increasing chest
pain worse with cough, and inspiration. Pain localized to
central chest, constant. Denies orthopnea, PND, leg swelling.
She also reported a one week h/o diarrhea, although severity
unclear. She denies noting bloody stools or melana. She reports
one week of urinary frequency but no dysuria or hematuria.
Reports bilateral knee pain, subjective warmth, chills,
nightsweats.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, chills, night sweats, nonproductive cough, urinary
frequency, knee pain bilaterally
(-) Denies headache, palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea,
vomiting, constipation. Denies dysuria, or urgency. Denies
arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes.

EKG ([**2139-5-12**]): Sinus rhythm. Extensive T wave inversions in
leads V2-V5 are suggestive of myocardial ischemia as are the
changes inferiorly. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2139-2-7**]
repolarization abnormalities are more extensive and suspicious
for ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested.

EKG ([**2139-5-13**]): Sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia. Extensive T
wave abnormalities are suggestive of myocardial ischemia. No
significant difference when compared with previous tracing.

TTE ([**2139-5-13**]): The left atrium is elongated. There is bowing of
the interatrial septum toward the left c/w high right atrial
pressures. The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Severe right ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Septal flattening in systole and diastole c/w RV pressure/volume
overload.

CHEST X-RAY ([**2139-5-13**]): A single portable chest radiograph is
obtained.  Mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis are
unchanged since [**2139-2-11**]. No new focal consolidation,
effusion, or pneumothorax is present. Cardiac and mediastinal
contours are unremarkable. IMPRESSION:
Mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis are similar to
[**Month (only) 956**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 87027**] is a 55 yo female with history of [**Known lastname 14165**] cell disease
and pulmonary embolus, not on anticoagulation, who presented to
OSH w/ pleuritic CP and worsening dyspnea on exertion concerning
for PE or acute chest syndrome.

# DYSPNEA/HYPOXIA: Patient with one week of worsening dyspnea,
cough, and found to be hypoxic. Given recent h/o documented
PE's, elevated D-dimer, EKG abnormalities (new S1Q3T3) and
elevated troponin, her presentation was most concerning for PE.
Acute chest syndrome also high on differential given h/o SS and
musculoskeletal complaints. Labs showed severe hemolysis
consistent with [**K
