Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2518**]
Chief Complaint:
acute left hemiparesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Femoral arterial access for attempted Intra-arterial TPA
Endotracheal intubation
radial arterial line

History of Present Illness:
77yo woman with PMH signficant for atrial fibrillation, CHF EF
35%, hemothorax s/p VATS 1mo ago, and TB with treatment
initiated [**9-20**] presents with acute left hemiparesis. She was
with her son in her usual state of health around 10:30am when
she had acute onset of left hemiparesis, witnessed by her son.
EMS
was called and she presented to [**Hospital1 18**] as a CODE STROKE at 11:07.
Neurology was at the bedside at 11:08am.

On arrival, NIHSS was 21 (see below). HCT/CTA/CTP was performed,
showing a proximal right MCA occlusion. Interventional radiology
was called and she was brought immediately to the INR suite for
IA tPA. Of note, the thoracic surgeon was called regarding her
recent VATS procedure; he felt she was not at risk for recurrent
hemothorax or bleeding from the site given the procedure was 1
month ago. ID was also called, given her recent initiation of
RIPE therapy for TB, and did not feel she needed to be on
precautions as she had been taking the medications daily since
[**9-20**].

hypertension
systolic CHF, EF 35% 9/21
tuberculosis on sputum culture x 2 ([**8-26**], [**8-27**]) but not on AFB
smears, started on multidrug therapy [**9-20**] w/ DPH
pleural effusion and hemothorax during recent hospitalization in
the setting of a supratherapeutic INR, with hct drop 28-22 and
VATS [**8-27**] with 750cc drained and chest tubes placed, evidence of
granulomatous inflammation
hyperlipidemia


Social History:
no tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use, lives w/ her son in
[**Name (NI) 669**], takes
care of herself at home

Family History:
Not elicited;

No family members with hx of TB

10 dysarthria: 1
11 neglect: 2

Mental status: awake, somnolent, able to follow commands when
given from the right side (not acknowledging questions/commands
from the left side), language dysarthric, but able to repeat.
Can
name thumb, nail, chair. Cannot read.

Cranial nerves: pupils very small, though equal and reactive,
?cataracts, decreased left visual field, right gaze preference
with inability to cross midline to the left, left facial droop

Motor: RUE lifts without drift x 10 seconds, and purposeful, LUE
flaccid w/o movement, RLE moves but is not antigravity, LLE
triple flexes

Sensory: responds to noxious in all extremities

DTRs, [**Name (NI) 14791**] and gait were not tested acutely.  When patient was
in ICU, no overt ataxia out of proportion to weakness.  Gait was
not assessed until PT working with patient on floor, and needed
assistance to walk due to left-sided weakness.

Imaging Studies-

CT BRAIN PERFUSION  [**2107-9-26**] 11:28 AM

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS
FINDINGS: There is no sign for the presence of an intracranial
hemorrhage. However, a nearly 1 cm, heavily calcified probable
aneurysm is noted in the region of the supraclinoid portion of
the left internal carotid artery. There is atherosclerotic
calcification involving the distal cavernous portion of the
right internal carotid artery. While the images are degraded by
patient motion, there is no definite evidence for a major
vascular territorial infarct. However, there is slightly
diminished density, approximately 1 cm in dimension within the
anterior aspect of the right lentiform nucleus. This finding
could represent a subacute-to-chronic infarct. The surrounding
osseous and soft tissue structures do not display additional
abnormalities.

CONCLUSION: No intracranial hemorrhage. Other findings as noted
above.

CT perfusion study was obtained, including the CT angiography.

FINDINGS: There is prolongation of the mean transit time and
reduced blood flow within the right temporal lobe, frontal and
parietal lobes, within the territory of the right middle
cerebral artery. However, there does not appear to be visible
reduction in blood volume. This combination of findings suggests
the presence of acute brain ischemia, that may be reversible if
thrombolysis is promptly instituted (see below).

The CT angiogram does disclose a cutoff of flow within the right
middle cerebral artery just distal to its origin, most likely
due to an embolus. Additionally, there is confirmation of the
1-cm left supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm.

No other definite vascular abnormalities are appreciated, aside
from heavy atherosclerotic calcification of the origin of the
left vertebral artery and to a minor degree involving the aortic
arch.

CONCLUSION: Right proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion and
reduced perfusion wtihin its territory. Left supraclinoid
internal carotid artery aneurysm.

CTA CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: ([**2107-9-29**] 12:54
PM)
There is an NG tube with the tip in the stomach. There are
several mediastinal lymph nodes with the largest measuring 19 x
11 mm in a right paratracheal location. There has been interval
decrease in the pleural fluid in the right hemithorax. There is
residual fluid and pleural thickening present at the right lung
base. There is multifocal consolidation present in the right
lung likely representing recent thoracic surgery.

There is a ground-glass subpleural nodule in the right upper
lobe, this is unchanged since the prior examination and may
represent infectious or inflammatory. A followup CT is
recommended to assess for resolution and to exclude the
possibility of a bronchoalveolar cell cancer.

The heart is grossly enlarged. The main pulmonary artery
measures 33 mm. The ascending aorta at the level of the right
main pulmonary artery measures 34 x 33 mm. The right coronary
artery arises from the normal expected anatomical location. The
left coronary artery arises from the left aortic cusp in a
posterior position than usual. There is no aortic dissection.

There are bilateral renal cortical low attenuation foci likely
representing cysts.

MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is thoracic kyphoscoliosis with
multilevel degenerative changes present in the spine.

CONCLUSION:

1. No aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism. The heart is
grossly enlarged, and the main pulmonary artery measures 33 mm
in maximum transverse diameter.

2. The left coronary artery arises from the left coronary cusp
in a position more posterior than usual. The right coronary
artery arises from the normal anatomical location.

3. Postoperative changes are present in the right hemithorax
with decreased pleural effusion and multifocal consolidations.
There are enlarged lymph nodes also present in the mediastinum
as described above.

4. 5 mm ground-glass subpleural nodule in the right upper lobe
is likely inflammatory in nature; however, a followup CT is
recommended in six months to assess for resolution and to
exclude a small focus of bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma.

Echocardiogram [**2107-9-29**]-
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is [**3-31**]
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate to
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of
