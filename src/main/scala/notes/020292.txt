Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis
Placement of PICC line


History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 yo M with PMH of chronic vent/trach, severe COPD,
prior L CVA with residual R-sided weakness, depression and
schizophrenia who presents from rehab w/hypoxia, tachycardia and
hypotension after desatting to 70% in the setting of possible
suicidal ideation.  Per pt, he is not sure why he was brought to
the hospital.  He feels well and denies suicidal ideation.  He
denies fever/chills, no cough/SOB/CP. Denies abdominal
pain/N/V/D/C. No HA/dizzyness.

.
In the ED: T 99.0, HR 110-140s, SBP 70-80s improved with 2+
liters IVF to 90s. Femoral CVL was placed and pt was started on
levophed and neo. Pt was asxtic throughout hypotension. EKG NSR
w/ PACs. Given [**Last Name (un) 2830**]/vanc in ED for sepsis and w/ concern for h/o
recent pseudomonal PNA resistant to cephalosporins and
quinolones.
.
Of note, patient has been on a ventilator since [**Month (only) 359**] for
respiratory failure secondary to severe COPD. He was found to
have a RML and RLL collapse and paratracaheal LAD as well as
chronic right pleural effusions at that time.  Per old discharge
summaries, his workup has been negative for malignancy.
.
Currently endorses low back pain which is chronic for him, but
otherwise denies GU/GI/CV/Resp/MSK sx as in HPI.

[**6-30**] Chest CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of a pulmonary embolism.
2. Right lung collapse with retained secretions, slightly
improved aeration compared to [**2141-6-28**].
3. Stable mediastinal adenopathy.
4. Stable bilateral pleural effusions.
5. Over inflated fluid-filled tracheostomy tube cuff, unchanged.


[**7-1**] CXR:
Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has increased in size,
now tracking along the apex. Persistent atelectasis involving
right lower and middle lobes. Heterogeneous opacities in the
left lung have progressed, and a small left pleural effusion is
unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Pneumonia:
Sputum and BAL cultures grew Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas.
Treated with regimen of cefepime, tobramycin, and high dose
Bactrim (details in discharge plan). Last tobra peak and trough
acceptable, no need to follow for remainder of course. Had
frequent mucous plugging requiring bronchoscopic suctioning, no
need over the last 72 hours. Currently on vent settings of AC
500x18/8/40%, satting 98-100% and with no significant dyspnea.
Continues to have chronic right sided pleural effusion with
associated collapse, significantly improved after IR-guided
thoracentesis. Pleural fluid not concerning for empyemia.
Further vent weaning to be done at extended care facility.
.
# Hypotension:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40503**] experienced multiple episodes of relative hypotension
to SBP 70s. Originally thought to be attributable to septic
physiology in setting of above pneumonia. AM cortisol
