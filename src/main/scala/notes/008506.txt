Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement
Replacement of tunneled dialysis catheter
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
71 yo F with h/o ERSD on HD, CAD s/p 2 prior stents, HTN, PVD,
AAA 6.5 cm and COPD who was found unresponsive around 2am this
morning and was taken to an OSH. She was found to have
hypercarbic respiratory failure with a respiratory and metabolic
acidosis(ABG 7.08/80/290), BNP 5000, WBC 20, and lateral ST
depressions in EKG. She was placed on BiPAP, blood cultures were
stent and she was started on Zosyn and received hemodialysis
with 2.5L removed with UF. When her troponin I was elevated at
1.75, a femoral CVL was placed and IV heparin started.
.
Prior to transfer, VS HR 80s in SR, BP 140/70s, on BIPAP 12/6 3L
ABG 7.33/43/129. She was reported to be alert but lethargic,
moving all extremities having had 2 bowel movements. She had
left leg pain from placement of intraosseous IV in the field.
She had dopplerable LE pulses but mottled skin with 2+ edema.
.
Per family, the patient had been experiencing a dry cough over
the past few weeks and had been treated for PNA requiring 10
days of hospitalization in early [**Month (only) 359**]. She was scheduled for
an elective AAA repair on the morning of presentation because it
had recently been increasing in size.
.
On review of systems, reports recent dry cough with occassional
sputum production but denies. she denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She uses a wheelchair at baseline. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

RUQ U/S [**11-29**]:
1. Branching echogenic pattern in the liver, concerning for
possible tubular gas. The configuration is most consistent with
hepatic venous gas
(conceivably from central venous line), although considerations
include
pneumobilia and portal venous gas. Correlation to history,
physical
examination and lactate value is recommended. This finding might
be further
evaluated with a CT.
2. 6cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.
3. No Budd-Chiari syndrome and limited evaluation of the hepatic
artery,
secondary to poor patient tolerance.
4. Cholelithiasis.
.
CT A/P [**11-30**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No portal venous gas or pneumobilia.
2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease with an infrarenal
abdominal aortic
aneurysm, measuring 60 x 56 mm.
3. Cholelithiasis.
.
TTE [**11-30**]
The left atrium is mildly elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate global
left ventricular hypokinesis with more severe hypokinesis of the
basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls (LVEF = 30%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with
some regionality suggestive of multivessel CAD or other diffuse
process. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
hypokinesis. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
.
Cardiac Cath [**12-4**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent disease. The previous LAD stent was patent and the LAD
had
diffuse calcification with distal 50-60% stenosis. The Lcx was
calcified
and occluded. The distal Lcx filled via collaterals from the
diagonal.
The RCA had diffuse disease with serial 90% stenosis and
distally filled
via collaterals from the LAD.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated left sided
filling
pressure with an LVEDP of 35 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
