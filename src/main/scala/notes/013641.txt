History of Present Illness:
[Completed by ICU housestaff]

81M with history significant for diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's
disease, and  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with LVOT obstruction.
He has had two septal ablations ([**5-7**] and [**8-9**]), the first was
complicated by complete heart block and he had placement of a
St. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12557**] DR [**Last Name (STitle) 8997**] chamber PPM/ICD placement for CHB and
primary prevention of sudden cardiac death.

He presented in [**2121-12-5**] with enterococcal bacteremia
with a left psoas abscess, spinal osteomyelitis, and an ICD lead
vegetation. He underwent abscess drainage, and was treated with
ampicillin/gentamicin. Because of the potential morbidity
associated with lead extraction, he elected to continue medical
therapy with  ampicillin and gentamicin, followed by indefinite
oral ampicillin therapy.

Unfortunately, he developed gentamicin renal toxicity with
volume overload and anasarca, and was rehospitalized from [**1-12**] -
[**2122-1-22**] during which time he was diuresed ~ 15 liters of fluid.

He now returns after being found unresponsive at his [**Hospital1 1501**] this AM
and his glucose found to be in 50s. EMS was called and an
interosseus line was placed. He was given 1 amp D50 which
brought glucose up to 80s; he was briefly mask ventilated in the
field due to poor mental status.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T92 oral (34.3 rectal), P76 BP
170/81 R26 92% on 2L. PICC line in place and cultures drawn.
Glucose decreased to 64 in ED and given another [**12-6**] amp
dextrose. RIJ also placed for access. Temps improved with bare
hugger. Patient was given D5 IVFs at 125. Vanc and zosyn also
given.
.
On the floor, patient alert and fully oriented. Recalls going to
bed last night and then nothing again until ambulance ride.
Reports eating fairly well recently without recent change.
Daughter reports had sugary fried dough last night. No recent GI
illness or URI symptoms. No recent change in insulin. Notes
bilateral leg pain from swelling, which is overall improved.
.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI. Endorses recent weight loss (total 40#) with
improvement in LE edema.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of
breath. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
[HOSPITALIST ACCEPT NOTE SUMMARY]

I saw the patient in the ICU prior to transfer to the medical
floor and I met with his wife as well. The patient is feeling
well, eating a full diet, oriented to place and circumstance.
His exam is remarkable for crackles at the left > right base.
The heart is regular, no murmurs are heard. The PM pocket is
benign. The abdomen is soft and without tenderenes. There is
mild pitting edema in the ankles (boots are in place over the
calves). He can move all for extremities, he has a tremor. His
speech is fluent and comprehension is normal.

All labs, studies, and medications reviewed.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:

81 year old male with recent enterococcal bacteremia complicated
by spinal osteomyelitis, psoas abscess, and pacer/ICD wire
infection. The patient subsequently was readmitted for
gentamicin renal toxicity/renal failure and anasarca, and
discharged again to rehab. He is now readmitted with
hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and obtundation.
.
The initial concern was for sepsis. He was seen by infectious
disease, they recommended removal of his PICC line, broad
coverage, and then to taper back to ampicillin alone once the
infectious evaluation is complete - this was completed and his
cultures remained negative. It appears that this presentation
may have been due to hypoglycemia, but it is difficult to
recreate the circumstances that led to these events. While he
likely has decreased insulin requirements related to renal
failure, the requirements for repeated D50 administration
suggest that he given the wrong dose. At this point it is
difficult to recreate the circumstances surrounding this event.
.
DIABETES MELLTUS TYPE II/HYPOGLYCEMIA: Titrated insulin to
conservative control, accepting sugars in the 200s to avoid
repeated lows.
.
ENTEROCOCCAL BACTEREMIA/OSTEOMYELITIS/PM LINE INFECTION: The
plan as communicated to me by [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] resident - once cultures from
this hospitalization are confirmed negative, will transition
back to IV ampicillin, and then to indefinite oral amoxacillin.
He was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in late [**Month (only) 956**] who
noted that the vegetation on the ICD lead is now smaller and he
was satisfied with the patients response to antibiotic therapy.
Will need close outpatient ID follow-up, apparently he was
scheduled to see [**First Name8 (Name
