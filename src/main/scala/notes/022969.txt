Chief Complaint:
DVT found at OSH

none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 64 year old male with h/o GBM (s/p craniotomy
[**2163-12-20**], [**2-19**] way through treatment) transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
DVT, found to have PE in [**Hospital **] transferred to MICU for monitoring.


He had complained of progressive SOB and LLE swelling x 2 weeks.
 He has also had a non-productive cough; denies pleuritic chest
pain but does have substernal pain when he coughs.  No
hemoptysis; no fever or chills.  This morning Rad Onc from
[**Hospital3 3765**] was concerned that the patient had a DVT.  His
SpO2 was low, 84%RA.  Dopplers confirmed LLE DVT.  Head CT was
negative for bleeding.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] was called and accepted
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Per report, she recommended 1000U IV
heparin gtt without a bolus.

In our ED, vitals were T 99.1  P 82  BP 104/68  RR 20  SpO2 90%
on 4L NC.  Neurosurgery was called.  He was admitted to the MICU
for his hypoxia.

CTA Chest:
1. Acute pulmonary embolism involving both distal main pulmonary
arteries with extension into segmental branches of all pulmonary
lobes. Prominence of the right ventricle suggests right heart
strain for which further evaluation with echocardiography is
suggested.
2. Fatty liver.
These findings were immediately discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4320**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 75406**]
of the emergency room at 10:20 p.m. [**2164-2-16**] at which time an
ER dashboard wet read was placed.

EKG [**2-16**]: NSR @ 77, nl axis/intervals.  grossly unchanged from
[**12-23**].
.
MR BRAIN:
MPRESSION: Since [**2163-12-24**], increase in size of the enhancing
mass involving the right centrum semiovale and possible minimal
increase in size of a 0.4-cm lesion more inferiorly involving
the right frontal/insular region.
Marginal enhancement around the high right frontal resection
cavity with improvement in surrounding edema.
T2 hyperintensities involving the corpus callosum and the
frontal lobe white matter bilaterally which likely represents
combination of edema and tumor.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 y/o male with GBM and new large DVT/PE, started on heparin
drip and transferred from MICU to floor on supplemental oxygen,
discharged on room air on lovenox.
.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
.
# DVT/PE and hypoxia -- clots likely [**2-18**] cancer. Brother w/ h/o
of PE in setting of marathon and long flight, no other h/o
hematologic disorders. CEs and EKG within normal limits.
Improved oxygenation on heparin gtt with PTT goal 60-80 given
brain met, 98% on RA on discharge. Lovenox started [**2-23**] and
patient received teaching.  He will have a VNA on discharge to
ensure correct injection administartion and adequate oxygen
saturation. His LE edema improved and he was ambulating well on
room air at discharge.
.
# Glioblastoma multiforme: s/p neurosurgical resection of one
tumor and started radiation for other lesion at outpt rad onc,
now on hold since hospitalized. Chemotherapy per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**]
and he was restarted on Temodar, to finish with completion of
radiation.  He had some proximal lower extremity weakness on
neurologic exam but otherwise no focal findings.  He was
continued on dexamethasone which may be tapered after completion
of radiation.  He was started on a PPI.  He will receive
cyberknife therapy as outpatient.  Repeat MRI w/o significant
e/o tumor recurrence.
.
# H/A: ?[**2-18**] edema versus hypoxia. Pt agreed to restarting
dexamethasone. H/A also potentially related to increased hypoxia
overnight but improved on discharge.
.
# Fatigue: likely [**2-18**] chemotherapy and worsened by hypoxia. Pt
was started on provigil.  Rital deferred [**2-18**] PE and potential
right hear strain.
.
# Dyslipidemia
- continued crestor
.
# Code: Full (confirmed with patient)
