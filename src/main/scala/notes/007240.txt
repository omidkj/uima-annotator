Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension s/p cardiac cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cath plus stenting of LAD

History of Present Illness:
77 year old male with h/o HTN, EF 45%, hyperlipidemia, PVD, CVA,
s/p right CEA, STEMI (ST depressions in V2-V6 and 1mm STE in
III, 0.5mm STE in II and avF; [**5-7**]), 3vCAD s/p CAGB x1 (Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]; SVG-0>OM1; [**5-7**]) who was admitted for CCU
monitoring after cardiac cath with stent placement. The patient
has been symptomatic again with his typical exertional chest
pain for the last few weeks (responsive to Nitro). He was
recently ruled out for an MI during an admission from
[**Date range (1) 16589**] (also found to have ARF which resolved after IVF).
He was scheduled for an outpatient stress test on [**2149-4-3**]. The
exercise stress test was positive (6.75 minutes [**Doctor Last Name 4001**]
protocol, 66% max PHR, stopping due progressive anginal symptoms
with 9/10 arm pain radiating to the chest). The MIBI showed a
reversible defect in the lateral wall and he was sent for
cardiac cath on the day of admission.
.
A cypher stent was placed into LM/LAD. It was attempted to place
also a stent into the mid-distal LAD lesion but failed. During
the catheterization, he developed intermittent CP. His SBP went
up into the 220s and he received IV nitro. Next, the question of
a dissected LAD came up based on the angiographic image of the
wire. He received intracoronary Nitro (200 mcg) to dilate the
vessel and identify any dissection which could not be confirmed.
After this administration, his SBP dropped into the 70s and he
developed a vagal reaction with HR in upper 30s to lower 40s.
This event lasted approx 5 minutes and he responded to IV
atropin, very brief dopamine drip and IVF. There was no LOC but
some associated CP. There were transient ischemic changes during
the procedure (ST depressions in V4-V6). He was exposed to more
than 350cc of dye, about one hour of fluoro and he lost a
significant amount of blood. He received Angiomax in the cath
lab and was started on a bicarb drip. He next was transferred to
the CCU for monitoring after the above mentioned events.

Pertinent Results:
Pre-cath EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 65 with normal
axis, normal intervals, no ST changes, old Q in III, old TWF in
aVF. Post-cath EKG showed transient ST depressions in V4-V6 (EKG
on next morning back to baseline).
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2148-5-20**] demonstrated: EF 45%
Pre revascularization:
1.No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body
of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. No left ventricular aneurysm
is seen. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
mild hypokinesia of the mid and apical portions of the inferior
wall and the inferolateral walls.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) to
moderate{ 2+} mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Post revascularization:
1. Biventricular systolic function remains unchanged.
2. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation persists.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2148-5-15**] demonstrated:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated two vessel
coronary artery disease and branch vessel disease in this right
dominant circulation. The LMCA had proximal calcification with a
30% proximal stenosis. The LAD had a 40% proximal stenosis, a
70% D1 stenosis, and 70% origin stenoses in the S1 and S2. The
LCX had a 70% hazy origin stenosis with a 70% stenosis in the
OM2. The RCA was diffusely diseased and tortuous with a 70%
proximal stenosis, and a 95% distal stenosis that involved the
origin of the PDA that was occluded.
2. Right heart catheterization demonstrated normal right and
minimally elevated left sided filling pressures with RVEDP=7
mmHg and mean PCWP=12 mmHg. Pulmonary arterial pressure was
normal. Cardiac
output and index were 7.7 L/min and 3.8 L/min/m2 respectively.
3. Left ventriculogram was not performed to reduce constrast
load.
4. Right femoral Swan Ganz catheter and femoral venous
introducing
sheath were sutured for transport to intenstive care unit.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease with branch vessel
disease.
2. Normal RV diastolic function. Minimal LV diastolic
dysfunction.
.
CARDIAC CATH [**2149-4-4**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated three vessel CAD. The LMCA had an 80% distal
stenosis. The LAD had an 80% ostial stenosis and 70% mid-distal
tubular lesion at the takeoff of the D1. The D1, S1, and S2 all
had 80% ostial lesions. The LCX ostium was subtotally occluded.
The OM1 filled via the patent SVG and both were free of
obstructive disease. The RCA was a small vessel and had
sequential 90% stenosis at mid and distal segments. The R-PDA
was totally occluded.
2. Conduit arterial angiography revealed patent single graft
(SVG-OM1).
3. Limited hemodynamic assessment demonstrated initial severe
hypertension (up to MAP of 130 mmHg) that was successfully
treated with intravenous nitroglycerine and a brief episode of
hypotension followed by bradycardia following the administration
of 200 mcg of IC nitro. This resolved shortly with treatment.
4. Left ventriculography was deferred.
5. The lesion in the ostial LAD was predilated with a 2.5mm
balloon,
stented with a 3.0 mm Cypher stent and post dilated with a 3.5
mm
balloon with lesion reduction to 0%. The final angiogram showed
TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection, no
perforation and no embolisation. The patient left the lab in a
stable condition.
6. The ostium of the D2 was treated with POBA using a 2.5 mm
balloon.
Final angiogarm showed normal flow, minimal residual stenoses,
no
dissection, no perforation and no angiographic evidence of
distal
embolisation. The patient
