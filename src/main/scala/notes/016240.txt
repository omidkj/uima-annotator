History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1356**] is an 86 year old man with a history of essential
tremor s/p placement of a DBS on [**6-30**]. He reports initially
feeling well following the placement of the DBS. However, over
the last 3 days, he has has some shortness of breath, fatigue,
and worsening tremors. He describes these tremors as like his
essential tremor except much worse and all over his body. He did
not take his temperature. He thought his new DBS was not working
properly and called neurosurgery. He went to [**Hospital **] Hospital.
There a chest xray revealed bilateral infiltrates. He received
ceftriaxone and azithromycin and 250 cc of IVF. A head CT was
performed which showed the DBS, but no acute abnormality.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. In the ED
(initial vitals 99 80 129/57 34 97% 4L) he was initially
tachypneic to the thirties. He received vancomycin and
acetaminophen for a temp of 102.8. Neurosurgery was made aware
of his admission. The OSH films were uploaded. Vitals on
transfer were 84, 95% 3L, 20, 107/47.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he appeared comfortable and was
conversant. He denies any episodes of shortness of breath or
chest pain or cough.
He reports always having a headache since the surgery, but no
change. Denies neck stiffness, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation,
abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria,
frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies
rashes or skin changes.

[**2102-7-15**] CXR: There is a generator device with a wire seen
extending superiorly into the neck, unchanged since the previous
studies. Please correlate clinically. The heart size is upper
limits of normal and there is tortuosity of thoracic aorta.
There are hazy opacities in both lung fields, right side worse
than left. This may represent infection or asymmetric pulmonary
edema. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion.

extending into the neck.  Please correlate clinically. There is
stable cardiac size without significant enlargement. There are
hazy densities in the lung fields bilaterally which have
improved since the previous study. There are no signs of overt
pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces.  No pleural effusions are
seen on either side.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is the brief hospital course for an 86 year-old man with a
recent DBS placement hospitalization who presented this
admission with fever and worsening of his baseline essential
tremor. Chest x-ray was concerning for pneumonia and the patient
was admitted to the ICU. The following active issues were
addressed this admission.
.
Fever: Chest x-ray, per OSH read, was consistent with a
bilateral pneumonia. Portable chest xray in [**Hospital1 18**] ED was
suggestive of bibasilar consolidation more consistent with
atelectasis than pneumonia. Given that the patient was recently
admitted to the hospital, he was initially empirically covered
with vancomycin and zosyn for HAP. He looked well by the morning
after admission, and his coverage was narrowed to levofloxacin
750mg for a total 5 day course (day 1 [**7-17**]) for CAP.
.
Essential Tremor: He is continued on his home meds with
neurosurgery aware.
.
Elevated INR: INR was super-therapuetic to 4.9 on admission so
coumadin was held until [**2102-7-18**] when 10mg was given just prior
to discharge. VNA services will draw INRs on the patient at home
starting [**2102-7-20**] and occuring every other day. Those results
will be faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6099**] in cardiology at Northshore who will
adjust the Warfarin dose as needed. Patient's dose of warfarin
on admission was 10mg Sun, Tues, Thurs and 13mg Mon, Wed, Fri,
Sat. He is discharged today on 10mg Qday.
.
Decreased hematocrit: There was a drop in baseline Hct from 44
-> 37 noted on admission, but there were no signs of bleeding
while in house.
.
Gout: Continued on home allopurinol.
.
CAD: Continued on home aspirin, statin, and propanolol (more for
tremor than beta-blockade).
.
Hypothyroidism: Continued on home medication.
.
Patient is discharged home with VNA services for home physical
therapy, INR draws, and medication management. He has adequate
follow-up. Vitals stable. Patient agrees.
