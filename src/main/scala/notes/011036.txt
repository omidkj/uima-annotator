History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 50 year old female with multiple myeloma, s/p
autologous stem cell transplant, transfusion dependent,
presenting with fevers and upper respiratory congestion. The
patient was in her usual state of health until two days prior to
admission when she began sneezing. She came to the outpatient
clinic for platelet and blood transfusions over the weekend. The
night prior to admission, she developed a frontal headache,
runny nose, nasal congestion, watery and red eyes and had
difficulty sleeping. She presented for a scheduled visit at the
clinic for platelet transfusion today.  She developed a
temperature to 100.5 after one unit of blood transfusion.  She
was also transfused one unit of platelets.  The patient was
admitted for febrile neutropenia.

Past Medical History:
Multiple Myeloma
-Diagnosed with IgG multiple myeloma in [**2162**].  She was followed
expectantly with stable asymptomatic disease
-[**9-/2170**] she developed back pain, anemia and an IgG level to the
mid 3000 range.  Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated approximately
40-50% plasma cellularity.  MRI revealed an expansile lesion in
the left iliac crest.  She was treated with pulse Decadron until
[**10/2170**] but developed hypercalcemia.
-She received high-dose Cytoxan for stem cell priming.  On
[**2171-3-8**], she underwent an autologous bone transplant and
attained a CR.
-[**2-/2173**], she was noted to have a rising IgG level with
progressive bone pain
-bone marrow biopsy performed in [**4-/2173**] showed 90% plasma cell
cellularity with amyloidosis by [**Country 7018**] red staining comprising
approximately 40% of the marrow core.
-[**2173-5-25**], she was started on protocol 04-130 with Velcade and
Revamid--and completed 8 cycles.
-[**10/2174**], found to have progressive disease by skeletal survey.
She was restarted on Velcade/Revlamid to cytoreduce prior to
allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
-[**12-12**], secondary to poor response to therapy, changed to
Melphalan, Revlamid, Prednisone


Social History:
Lives with husband and two children (daughter, 14 y/o, and son,
16y/o).  Denies significant tobacco use - smoked about [**2-7**] ppd
x2-3 years, quit 20y ago.  Occasional alcohol, no IVDU.  Does
not work outside the home.

.
[**12-27**]: CT sinus-IMPRESSION:
1. Mucosal thickening of the paranasal sinuses as described
above.
2. Preseptal periorbital soft tissue edema and postseptal
extraconal fat stranding, most consistent with a cellulitis.
.
[**12-28**]: MR head/brain: IMPRESSION:
1. Features consistent with invasive fungal sinusitis involving
primarily the bilateral ethmoid sinuses and the nasal cavity,
which are filled with presumably necrotic non-enhancing
material, and extension into and post- septal involvement of the
medial aspect of the right orbit.
2. Possible transgression of the cribriform plates with evidence
of reactive pachymeningeal enhancement in bifrontal regions.
3. Mucosal thickening in sphenoid sinus and right maxillary
fluid, with no definite direct extension of the ethmoid process.
4. No foci of abnormal enhancement noted in the brain.
5. Unremarkable cranial MRA.
.
[**1-1**]: MR orbit: CONCLUSION: Findings of some concern for
progression of fungal infection with secondary mucosal
abnormalities as noted above.
.
[**1-3**] CT sinus: IMPRESSION: Extensive sinus disease with
increased density consistent with the history of fungal
sinusitis.
.
[**1-24**] CT sinus: IMPRESSION: Persistent opacification of multiple
paranasal sinuses with worsening of opacity within the sphenoid
sinus. Although no definite bony erosion is identified,
increased subcutaneous air as well as air adjacent to the lamina
papyracea on the left raises the question of breach of this
structure, as well as transmission of infection via emissary
veins, the latter mechanism being invoked to account for the
tiny amount of left extraconal gas adjacent to the left lamina
papyracea.
.
[**2175-2-26**] CT sinus: IMPRESSION: Minimally increased aeration of
the paranasal sinuses since the prior of [**2175-1-24**]. No
definite osseous erosions are present. The subcutaneous air
within the left nasolacrimal duct persists. Please correlate
clinically.
.
[**3-1**] MR head/orbit: IMPRESSION:
1. There is marked distention of the left nasolacrimal duct
suggesting distal obstruction. Currently, it is distended with
fluid. Previously it was air filled.
2. There is extensive opacification of the paranasal sinuses
with minimal aeration of the sphenoid sinus, the maxillary
sinuses, and up to the ethmoid air cells as seen on the CT from
[**2-15**]. The left maxillary sinus air-fluid level is no longer
seen.
3. There is bilateral periosteal-based enhancement at the
lateral aspect of the lamina papyracea both pre-septal and
post-septal, unchanged from [**1-1**] and likely related to the
fungal infection.
4. The diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement seen previously has
improved.
5. The visualized marrow signal intensity is more abnormal than
previously, perhaps related to progression of the patient's
myeloma, perhaps related to marrow proliferation secondary to
infection.
.
[**3-4**] CT chest: IMPRESSION:
1. Large layering right-sided pleural effusion with associated
compressive atelectasis/ collapse of a large part of the right
lower lobe, and portions of the right middle lobe and right
upper lobe. There are high-density areas within this pleural
effusion dependently concerning for hematoma.
2. Multiple bilateral patchy focal opacities in the lungs with
associated ground-glass opacity consistent with an
infectious/inflammatory process. Follow-up is recommended to
demonstrate resolution.
3. Probable splenomegaly.
4. Small pericardial effusion.
5. Diffuse osseous abnormality consistent with multiple myeloma.
.
[**3-5**] CT chest: IMPRESSION:
1. Decrease in size of large right-sided pleural effusion with
improvement in previously noted atelectasis and collapse. Again
high-density area within this pleural effusion is concerning for
hematoma.
2. New right-sided pleural drainage tube with small right apical
pneumothorax.
3. Multiple patchy focal opacities within the lungs are again
identified, likely consistent with an infectious/inflammatory
process. Followup is again recommended to ensure resolution.
4. Diffuse osseous abnormality consistent with multiple myeloma.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
50 year old female with relapsed Stage 3A IgG kappa multiple
myeloma, presented with neutropenic fever, hospital course
complicated by GI bleed, invasive fungal sinusitis, and transfer
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for pleural effusion/hemothorax then underwent an
allo-BMT [**2175-3-14**].  Thereafter she had a PEA cardiac arrest and
was transferred to the ICU-east.  Hospital course organized by
ICU-East events then summary of prolonged hospital course:
