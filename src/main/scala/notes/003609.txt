Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname 80397**] was admitted one day prior
to surgery. She was started on Heparin and underwent usual
pre-operative work-up. On [**9-28**] he was brought to the operating
room where he underwent a aortic valve replacement. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. She was found to be in atrial fibrillation and
amiodarone was started.  EP was consulted and suggested medical
treatment with amiodarone instead of electrical cardioversion.
Her chest tubes were removed and she was transferred to the
floor.  Her wires were removed and she was started on coumadin.
She was agressively diuresed.  By post-operative day 8 she was
ready for discharge to home.
