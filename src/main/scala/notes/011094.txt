Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Erythromycin Base / Protamine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 826**]
Chief Complaint:
Hearing loss, nausea, vomitting, fevers.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
dialysis, PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 51 yo M on chronic prednisone and other
immune-suppressants with DM1, renal failure (2 failed
transplants, with recent dialysis re-initiation), CHF, HTN, and
HL who, following discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2137-6-29**] where he was
admitted for acute on chronic renal failure and worsening CHF,
re-presented on [**2137-6-30**] to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with bilateral hearing
loss, nausea, non-bloody emesis, and fevers/chills x 1 day.

Upon arrival to the ED, his vitals were HR 106, BP 112/37, RR
16, o2 sat 95 RA, T 100.9. He was given vancomycin and
ceftriaxone and 1L NS bolus. While this improved his BP
initially, he was again hypotensive to the 70s shortly
thereafter. Pressors were given, and the patient was transferred
to the MICU. On arrival to the MICU the patient was stable with
a BP in 110. He still endorsed mild hearing loss, but denied any
chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, fever, chills,
abdominal pain, dysuria, or diarrhea.

MICU course: Patient was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis
(+ketones in blood), anemic (Hct 20),  and with a low-grade
fever. While in the MICU, his ketoacidosis was successfully
treated and he was transfused to a Hct 28. Anemia labs were
consistent with anemia of chronic disease / chronic kidney
disease. A search for a cause of the fevers revealed negative
blood cultures, normal chest x-ray, and non-albicans yeast in
the urine. He was transferred to the regular medical service.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 51 yo M DM1>30years, CAD s/p CABG, CKD on HD, ESRD s/p
renal transplant on chronic prednisone and other
immunosuppressive medications, transferred from MICU with
diabetic ketoacidosis, hypotension, and anemia. While in the
MICU his hearing loss returned to baseline, his BP stabilized,
he received HD and careful glucose control which together led to
a resolution of his electrolyte abnormalities, and he was
transfused to a Hct >30.

#) BP control: On arrival to the medical service, he was
tachycardic and mildly hypertensive (after being hypotensive on
admission). His home Metoprolol was restarted and his blood
pressure was subsequently controlled.

#) DKA: Resolved in MICU. Lantus and ISS were initiated upon
arrival to medical service. On the day of discharge, electrolyte
abnormalities had improved significantly.

#) ECG changes: Initial elevated troponin was likely secondary
to demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. CKMB was never
elevated. By the day of transfer to the medicine service,
Troponin was trending down and the patient was asymptomatic. ACS
was thus ruled out. Statin and aspirin were continued.

#) CHF: Known systo
