Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**]
Chief Complaint:
pelvic fracture, pelvic hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. IR coil (x4)-embolization within the distal right
pudendal/obturator artery.
2. Mechanical intubation and ventilation x2
3. placement of chest tubes bilaterally

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old woman with a history of CAD s/p
distant MI, DVT/PE on coumadin, h/o pituitary tumor s/p
resection now with pan-hypopituitarism on chronic steroids who
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for right pelvic ramus fracture. She
suffered what was reported to be a mechanical fall (question of
presyncope prior to fall), hitting coffee table with her right
hip. She was initially seen at [**Hospital3 **] and was found to have
a right pelvic ramus fracture w/ active extravasation in to the
R anterior abdomen  extraperitoneal). She was given 1unit FFP
and 1unit pRBCs prior to transfer.

vit K for INR 2.0. She was admitted to T/SICU on [**1-28**].  She was
sent to IR for embolization where they coiled a right obdurator
or pudendal artery on [**1-29**] (4 coils). Repeat
imaging of her abdomen showed stability in hematoma in abdomen.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the trauma surgery service on
[**2153-1-28**] for her right pubic fractures with active extravasation
and pelvic hematoma.  She had a coil-embolization  within the
distal right pudendal/obturator artery by IR.  She was admitted
to the ICU for close monitoring.  She had a very complicated
course including development of respiratory failure leading to
intubation x2, MRSA-ventilator associated pneumonia, acute renal
failure, hypoadrenalism, acute CHF, as well as likely non-ST
elevation MI.
.
[**1-28**] Admitted to the TSICU. Went to IR for embolization. Placed
NGT for abd decompression
[**1-29**]: LENIS negative, serial abd exams unchanged. changed
prednisone to hydrocortisone
[**1-30**]: spiked to 102, then 103. APAP no effective. abd exam
inconclusive. repeat CT with no free air. repeat cxr with
possible new infiltrate. also hypotensive. 2 x 500cc boluses.
started vanc and zosyn for presumed PNA vs infected pelvic
hematoma. intermittent tachycardia to the 130s.
[**1-31**]: Fevers continued although not quite as high as the day
before. Overnight, had worsening respiratory status, thought
perhaps due to pulm edema and tried nitro/lasix/bipap but pt's
distress continued so was intubated. Difficult to sedate. Pt
appeared more comfortable after her vent was changed from CMV to
CPAP/PSV. Pt dropped BPs at 5:30am and RIJ and an art line were
placed.
[**2-1**]: Neo weaned, cards consulted, CT Torso no obvious abd
pathology except for stable hematoma, bedside TTE - dilated LV,
no RV strain, hypokinetic septum
[**2-2**]: TTE: Severe left ventricular contractile dysfunction. LVEF=
20 %). per cards, no intervention at this point. CXR with
pleural effusions. diuresed with lasix gtt @ goal of -100cc/hr.
still on albumin 0.25% q6. TFs started. [**2-1**] Ucx neg.
[**2-3**]: transfused 1un pRBCs. D/c'd vanc, continued zosyn. K 2.7-
repleted. Increasing electrolyte abnormalities, including
contraction alkalosis, likely related to overdiuresis.
[**2-4**]: lasix gtt d/c, b/l pigtail placed in each pleural space
[**2-5**]: d/c zosyn, started vanc. holding sedation, started haldol
PRN. will attempt to run her even. reduced hydrocortisone to
[**12-30**], 25mg q8h, cont levo. will need to cont taper. got a PICC
line. getting 100cc D5 q6h for hypernatremia.
[**2-6**]: extubatd, failed, tachypneaic, wet sounding, CXR showed
worsening pulm edema, reintubated.
[**2-7**]: Lasix gtt, febrile and was pancx.
[**2-8**]: held another family meeting. it was decided she will be
DNR/DNI definitively. per family request, pt extubated, with
understanding she will be CMO if resp distress. pt tolerated
extubation very well. VSS, sats in high 90s on face mask. cont
medical regimen as planned. currently on lasix gtt @ 10,
responding well. Na this AM 152. free water deficit about
1800cc. ? hypervolemic hypernatremia. reduced lasix gtt to 5.
started free water flushes through NGT. BPs hypertensive. h/o
HTN vs. pain. on coreg and metoprolol and hydralazine prn. now
communicating that she has alot of back pain. @ home on: ultram,
neurontin, celebrex, oxycodone, dilaudid, xanax. also, febrile
to 102. APAP and ibuprofen.
[**2-9**]: passed speech and swallow eval, recs for ground solids and
thin liquids. pigtails d/c'd. A-line pulled.
[**2-10**]: transfered to floor.
[**2-11**]: PT saw pt and cleared for rehab. Started ensure
supplementation.
[**2-12**]: Rising WBC (11->18 over 3 days), sent C. Dificile.
.
Neuro: While intubated, the patient received pain control with
IV pain medication and drips.  However, when cleared for oral
intake and transfered to the floor, the patient was transitioned
to oral pain medic
