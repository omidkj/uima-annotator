History of Present Illness:
HPI: 78yo F well-known to East Surgery service from prolonged
hospitalization [**Date range (1) 5324**]/10.  She had initially presented with a
colonic perforation due to erosion from a L hip prosthesis, and
underwent a Hartmann's procedure (sigmoid colectomy with end
colostomy).  She then required an emergent R-->L Fem-Fem bypass
for acute LLE ischemia.  The hip was treated with sequential
washouts and hardware removal.  Her post-operative course was
extensive, but notable for GI bleeding presenting as falling
anemia, for which an EGD showed mild esophagitis managed with
[**Hospital1 **]
protonix. A colonoscopy through the stoma was unsuccessful
because the stoma had sloughed and retracted below the skin
level.  She also developed CHF and hypothyroidism managed with
diuretics and synthroid, respectively.  Wound issues included
minor wound infection at the midline incision managed with
wet-to-dry, a VAC at the L hip changed serially in the OR and
later at the bedside, and mild breakdown at the Fem-Fem bypass
site treated with betadine swabs.  She was finally discharged on
[**2164-6-12**] on a prolonged course of Zosyn, Daptomycin, and
Fluconazole via a PICC.  Since discharge she has required 4u
PRBC
transfusion for anemia and guaiac positive ostomy output: 2u on
[**6-18**] and 2u on [**6-23**] (Hct was 23).  She denies headache,
dizziness,
CP, or SOB.  She denies abdominal pains, nausea, although did
have one episode of non-bloody non-bilious emesis this morning
and one earlier episode 4d ago.  Per the rehab notes, the
heparin
SQ was discontinued in favor of coumadin, which the pt's
daughters relate was done because she was "bleeding" at the
injection site.

IMAGING:
[**2164-6-24**] hip plain film on admission showed status post left hip
arthroplasty and Girdlestone procedure. Methyl methacrylate
remains in the defect produced by the removal of the left
femoral stem. Multiple clips and left pelvic embolization coils
are unchanged in appearance.

[**2164-6-24**] CT pelvis on admission showed new high-density material
envelops the femur and there are locules of gas in the left
gluteal area where there is an open wound. Locules of gas are
also seen within the femur. High-density material is also seen
overlying the left iliac intraabdominally. Right lower lobe
consolidation/atelectasis raises the possibility of infection.
Interval fem-fem bypass. New pelvicaliceal prominence
bilaterally. Persistent cholelithiasis.

[**2164-6-27**] CT guided hip aspiration: heterogeneous collection in
the lateral subcutaneous tissues over the left hip. The portion
of the collection just anterior/superior to the skin staples at
the lateral aspect of the hip was targeted for aspiration with
only a few cc of dark blood could be aspirated.


[**2164-6-30**] CT Chest and abdomen after patient developed hypoxia
showed no acute pulmonary embolus. Small right pleural effusion
with associated compressive atelectasis. Scattered ground-glass
opacity in the bilateral lungs.  No acute intra-abdominal
abnormality.Large heterogeneous left thyroid lesion. There was
also question of tracheobronchomalacia although formal diagnosis
would require dedicated CT chest with tracheal protocol.

[**2164-7-1**] Lower extremity ultrasound to evaluate for leg edema and
to rule out DVT was markedly limited duplex examination of the
left lower extremity secondary to patient body habitus
difficulty with patient positioning.  Apparent compressibility
of the common femoral vein, proximal superficial femoral vein
and popliteal vein without convincing color Doppler flow
identified. While this may be secondary to slow flow, a deep
venous thrombosis cannot be excluded. Repeat exam demonstrated
flow in all of the deep veins.

[**2164-7-2**] TT Echo showed moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, c/w LAD disease. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.

[**2164-7-2**] CTA pelvis after patient became acute anemic to evaluate
for bleed: show Fem-fem bypass graft patent, with a
pseudoaneurysm of the left external iliac, but similar to prior
study. There was chronic thrombosis of the portions of the left
external iliac artery which are stable. No evidence of new acute
hemorrhage or active extravasation. Stable appearance of left
hip with destruction of left proximal femur with gas seen within
the medullary cavity of the proximal femur. The residual hip
prosthesis is similar in appearance to prior study, with an
approximately 8.7 cm x 4.8 cm x 20 cm focus of air and debris
within the left gluteal soft tissues. Thickening of the left
iliacus relative to the right. Severe stenosis of the SMA. Small
bilateral pleural effusions associated with basal atelectasis.
Cholelithiasis, with gallbladder mildly distended though without
evidence of wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.

[**2164-7-17**]: CT of pelvic and L thigh after patient's WBC continued
to trend upward for show left pelvic gluteal collection now
contains predominantly air with air extending medial to the left
iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**]. Persistent osseous destruction of the left femur
with multiple pockets of fluid and inflammatory reaction
involving the left pelvis and left femur are
