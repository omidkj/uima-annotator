History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 year-old male with no significant PMH who presents
with dyspnea and cough x almost 1 week. He is not a very good
historian, and he states his cough may have been present for
weeks, though on further questioning, states its only x 1 week.

checked his temp at home. He also has chronic low back pain.

improved to 98% on NRB. He appeared ill, tachypneic, and
tachycardic. He had bilateral crackles. CXR concerning for LLL
PNA- he was given levofloxacin 750 mg x 1. He was also given 3L
NS for tachycardia. He then improved to 93-94% on 4L. ECG
without any ischemic changes. His vitals prior to transfer were
88, 110/50, RR 44 94% 4L.

ROS: The patient denies any fevers, weight change, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, frequency, urgency,
dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness,
vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes

Imaging/results:

CXR: [**2-21**] PA/Lat: Linguinal density c/w PNA

.
CT chest:
1. Extensive bilateral nodular ground-glass opacities with more
focal solid consolidation noted within the lingula and left
lower lobe in conjunction with a trace left pleural effusion and
probable mild reactive mediastinal lymph node enlargement. This
is likely infectious in etiology but follow up chest. CT
recommended to document resolution. No emphysema.
2. 6 mm LUL pulmonary nodule which can be reassessed at follow
up chest CT.
3. Atherosclerotic calcifications within the coronary
circulation and
intrathoracic aorta. Probable underlying LVH. Left subclavian
proximal artery stenosis.
4. Gallstone.

Brief Hospital Course:
67year old male h/o HTN, bipolar off meds, tobacco abuse
admitted with weeks/months of feeling "unhealthy", chronic NP[**MD Number(3) 23674**], mild DOE, chronic LBP.  Poor historian but stated he was
just feeling bad for so long that decided to come in, though
denied any acute changes in cough/dyspnea/fevers/chills. On
arrival to ER, he was febrile (pt not aware) and hypoxic 88%RA,
CXR with LLL PNA, got 3L IVFs, Levaquin, O2 and transfered to
MICU overnight. Did well in ICU, thus transfered to floor [**2-22**].
Since on Gen Med floor, continued to do better clinically, was
afebrile and cough improved, however had persistant hypoxia,
requiring 4L O2. Underwent CT chest which showed extensive
linguilar/LLL opacities with b/l GGO.  Given clinical
improvement in terms of fever and white count down, decided to
keep on levaquin X10days with follow up imaging for resolution.
He is being discharged on oxygen 3L with rest, 4L with exertion
with pulmonary follow up for further w/u (esp given b/l GGOs and
months of "fatigue/malaise").  Of note, peviously 2-3PPD
X30years (now 6cigs/day) which raises concern for COPD, but CT
w/o empysematous changes and exam w/o prolonged expiration.
nevertheless given tobacco history, was d/c'd on combivent.
Other issues here, has a mid-lower back 5cm circular wound that
wound care believes is likely thermal wound (uses heat packs),
reccommend silvedine.  SW saw pt while here given his unusual
social situation. He will return to monastery on discharge. He
has f/u arranaged with new PCP and pulm at [**Hospital1 18**] (see below)
.
.
See progress note below for details: .
67 year old male with h/o HTN, bipolar d/o, heavy tobacco abuse
admitted with weeks of malaise, [**MD Number(3) 2885**], ?dyspnea, with acute
worsening, found to have PNA with hypoxia, sepsis (resolved),
now doing much better except for persistant hypoxia
.
.
Community Acquired PNA: admission c fevers, leukocytosis,
tachycardia, and tachypnea-->sepsis resolved. NO sputum cx
obtained but clinically improved on levaquin.  Persistant
hypoxia (4L) and CT [**2-23**] with extensive LLL/linguilar
consolidation and bilateral GGOs.
-cont levaquin, day [**5-18**]
-chest CT as above, will need follow up CXR or CT to ensure
resolution or needs further w/u
-cont guaifenesin as expectorant
-have set up for home O2, 3L at rest, 4L with exertion,
hopefully can wean this overtime
-continue combivent for possible COPD component, will clarify
need base on spirometry after PNA resolved.
-vaccines as outpt since ongoing PNA
.
.
Hypoxia: LLL PNA extensive with bilateral GGO seen on CT.
Clinically improved though persistant O2 requirement.
?underlying COPD given heavy tobacco history, though admission
ABG w/o much hypercapnea and CT w/o emphysema. Not sure if has
baseline hypoxia causing his chronic malaise history or whether
all due to PNA
-as above, set up with home O2 3L rest, 4L exertion
-set up with pulm f/u [**3-5**] for further w/u hypoxia (spirometry),
also needs repeat imaging (f/u nodule and GGOs)
.
.
Wound: mid back. doesnt look infected. pt not at risk for
pressure ulcer. Per wound care nurse, more suggestive of thermal
injury (pt uses heat packs for chronic LBP)
-silvedine cream and dressing changes per wound care
-low suspicion for malignancy, but would refer to derm if no
improvement over next few weeks
.
.
Social situation: conflicting stories but pt did confide to
nurse that his house burned down and he is currenlty homeless
living in monastery. This is confirmed and they are happy to
pick up patient from hospital
-SW/CM have confirmed that pt has insurance/resources to pay for
meds/O2 (medicare)
.
.
HTN: Echo with LVH. BNP low so no heart failure causing
GGO/crackles/hypoxia.
-baseline Echo today prior to d/c, f/u read as outpt
.
.
Bipolar d/o: pleasant, compensated. Poor historian but that he
is not used to be hospitalized and is guarded given his social
situation
-follow, SW c/s as above, no need for psych
.
.
Tobacco abuse: offer nicotine patch while here.
.
.
.
Dispo/code: Full Code. Will d/c back to monastery today. has VNA
set up, home O2 set up, PCP appt for [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**] [**3-14**] with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1022**] at 2:30pm and pulm appt for Wed [**3-5**] with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Pt has to check in at 3:30pm for breathing test, and
then will meet Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 4pm.
