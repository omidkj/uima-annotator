Brief Hospital Course:
53 y/o male admitted for orthoptopic liver [**Hospital1 **].
He was taken to the OR by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The liver resection to remove his native liver was difficult.
During the surgery he received 16 units RBCs, 22 units FFP, 5
units platelets and had an EBL of 9 liters. Once the portal
anastomosis was secured, the liver pinked up and was making
bile. He has an end-to-end anastomosis of the common hepatic
artery to a branch patch of the gastroduodenal and the proper
hepatic artery, duct to duct anastomosis. Two [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains were
placed and the patient was transferred intubated to the SICU.
Please see the operative note for further surgical detail.
He was extubated on POD 1. He was reintubated on POD 2, due to
acute desaturation, BAL performed with thick secretions
obtained, normal flora on culture. In addition on POD 2 he
underwent a bedside thoracentesis for a large left pleural
effusion with drainage of 750 cc serosanguinous fluid. Pleural
fluid had no growth.
He was able to be extubated [**Last Name (un) 7162**] on POD 4.
A feeding tube was placed on [**6-10**] and tube feeds initiated.
He was seen daily by physical therapy.
Transferred to the regular surgical floor on POD 8. Despite
several placements with subsequent "pull outs" the patient did
not have a Dobhoff in place for nutritional supplementation
despite encouragement by all teams and nutrition of the
importance of the tube feeds.
A psych consult was called on [**6-14**] due to reported significant
changes from patients baseline, especially as reported by wife.
[**Name (NI) 15110**] to concerns for prolonged QTc and risk for Torsades, many
medications were ruled out in this patient. Assess ment per
psych is mild delirium with steroid induced hypomania. His
remeron was discontinued. As behavior is reported as irritable
but not grossly agitated, no medications were added.
He remained without the Dobhoff, calorie counts were initiated,
supplements written.
Continued work with PT shows minimal ability to achieve ADL's,
and requiring maximum assist with mobility.
He had a bridled Dobhoff placed on [**2109-6-20**], tube feeds were
started. In the meantime he had been maintained on TPN via a
PICC line.
He was having decreasing hematocrits around POD 17, and despite
receiving transfusions, he was not having appropriate Hct
increases. CT of abdomen revealed
 - Slight interval increase in the intraabdomial/pelvic and
subcapsular fluid
collection, part of which is still high attenuation consistent
with continued
bleeding. The location of the fluid has also redistributed
somewhat, with a
little bit less inferior to the tip of the liver. And so he
underwent Exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of hematoma, liver
biopsy with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**6-23**].
Per op report there was  a moderate amount of blood posterior to
the hilum and around the right lobe of the liver, which was
evacuated. There was also a sizable hematoma along the left side
of the vena cava between the vena cava and the crus of
the diaphragm and this was also removed and evacuated. there was
a moderate amount of bleeding from the gallbladder fossa itself
but this responded to argon beam
coagulation. He was returned to the surgical floor following his
PACU recovery, and his Hct has remained stable since that time.
On [**6-27**] an EGD revealed friability, erythemamatous ulcerations
and congestion in the middle third of the esophagus and lower
third of the esophagus compatible with esophagitis, a biopsy was
sent which revealed "Severe acute (neurophilic) esophagitis;
stain for fungus is negative.  Iron stain is negative." The
stomach mucosa was normal and to the second part of the
duodenum. He had not been on Fluconazole due to QTc prolongation
concerns. He was started on Ambisome x 10 days. He was then
started on PO Fluconazole, QTc interval has been normal. The ND
tube remained out and he was maintained nutritionally on TPN via
PICC line.
On [**7-2**] he again was sent for bridled Dobhoff feeding tube, and
Nutren 2.0 was started. Initially he had some diarrhea and
distention. Due to concerns for increased potassium and kidney
function slightly decreased he was switched to nutren renal for
tube feeds. Needs bowel regimen in place.
He was still being followed by OT/PT who recommended D/C to a
rehab facility. He remains a maximum assist.
Labs to be drawn every Monday and Thursday. PLease have patient
follow up with outpatient clinic visits per schedule.
