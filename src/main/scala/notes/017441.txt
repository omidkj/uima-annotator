Ascending Aorta Replacement (24mm gelweave graft)


History of Present Illness:
This 49-year-old patient with a history of shoulder arm pain was
investigated and had a positive stress test with subsequently
angiogram demonstrating significant lesion in the left anterior
descending artery and severe aortic regurgitation with dilated
ascending aorta. The left ventricular function was
well preserved with an ejection fraction of 55%, and he was
electively admitted for coronary artery bypass graft, AVR and
ascending aortic replacement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2172-4-24**] CTA Chest
Dilated ascending aorta to 4.5 cm. Extensive calcified plaque
formation in mid LAD.

[**2172-4-27**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: Poor echo windows.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Severe
(4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.
POST CPB: Preserved biventricular systolic function.
Bioprosthesis in aortic position. Well seated and mechanically
stable. Trace AI.


[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 44077**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2172-4-24**] for a CT scan
and surgical management of his heart disease. His CT scan
revealed an ascending aorta which was slightly dilated measuring
4.5 x 4.2 cm. As he had chest pain after the procedure, he was
admitted for further evaluation in anticipation of his Monday
surgery. Cardiac enzymes were cycled which were negative. On
[**2172-4-27**], he was taken to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to one [**Last Name (LF) 12425**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] aortic valve
replacement utilizing a 25 mm pericardial valve and an ascending
aorta replacement using a 24 mm gelweave graft. Postoperatively
he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. By postoperative day one, he was awake,
neurologically intact and extubated. Gentle diuresis was
initiated. He was transfused with packed red blood cells for
anemia. On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the
cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. Aspirin,
beta blockade and a statin were resumed. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative
strength and mobility. He went into atrial fibrillation on POD
#4 which converted to normal sinus rhythm with amiodarone. As he
remained in normal sinus rhythm, no anticoagulation was started.
Mr. [**Known lastname 44077**] continued to make steady progress and was
discharged home on postoperative day six. He will follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], his cardiologist and his primary care physician
as an outpatient.
