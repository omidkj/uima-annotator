4. New discrete enhancing rounded hyperdensity within the right
labia
adjacent to the skin defect site. This could represent a small
hematoma or lesion. Clinical correlation is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year old woman who was recented hospitalized
for an abscess incision and drainage in the right groin from
[**Date range (3) 23867**].  On [**2140-4-16**], she
was at dialysis when her groin wound spontaneously started
oozing blood. She was sent to the emergency department, where
her hematocrit was 30 from a baseline of 36 and she was
hypotensive into the 80s systolic.  The bleeding was
successfully stopped with lidocaine with epi and surgifoam. Her
INR was 3.0 at the time.  Her wound was examined by ACS who
repacked the wound and recommended admission for further
evaluation.  A duplex ultrasound demonstrated a small 1.4 x 1.2
cm pseudoaneurysm likely originating from an epigastric arterial
branch.

Over the course of the  next week, she developed recurrent
bleeding into her right thigh with associated anemia and
hypotension.  A CT was performed confirming  a the fistula
emanating from the femoral profunda and possibly from branches
off the common femoral with distended femoral vein and multiple
dilated venous branches extending into her pannus and into her
vulvar region consistent with her presentation of bleeding
episodes from her groin wounds.  She therefore underwent
a right groin exploration with take down of right common femoral
and right profunda artery arteriovenous fistulas on [**2140-4-26**].
The procedure was without complications although she did have a
4500cc blood loss requiring 6 liters crystalloid, 6 units packed
red blood cells, 2 units FFP, 1150 cc Cell [**Doctor Last Name **].

She was closely monitored in the ICU and then was ready for
transfer to the floor on POD 1. On POD 6, she developed erythema
and drainage from her groin incision.  She was started on
vancomycin, cipro and flagyl. The incision was opened and packed
with NS w>d.  The wound culture eventually grew klebsiella and
proteus.  Her antibiotic was changed to IV  meopeneum.  The
wound was assessed daily and debided as needed.  A wound VAC was
placed on [**2140-5-6**].  As she no longer needs debridement, and the
wound has started to granulate, she is ready for discharge. She
is now on her regular Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday dialysis
schedule. Her blood sugars have consistently been less well
controlled. Her coumadin has been restarted.  She is tolerating
a regular diet.  She has remained hemodynamically stable since
surgery.  Follow-up has been arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
2 weeks.
