History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107485**] is a 57 y/o M with h/o GI Bleed, HTN, CAD, CHF (EF
20%), PAFib, DM2, CRI, HCV, and polysubstance abuse who p/w 4
days SOB and CP.  States that he has had progressive dyspnea
over the 4 days pta, limiting him to a few steps at a time. Also
more leg edema and orthopnea. Reports medical compliance, but
questionable dietary compliance; girlfriend buys food with lots
of salt. Denies f/c, n/v; had cough productive of clear sputum.
Also had CP, substernal, "like someone walking on it," without
radiation. Notes last cocaine use several days before admission,
last EtOH was 1 day PTA.  In the ED, ECG was not ischemic and
CXR demonstrated signs of volume overload.  His VS were T98 105
206/91 36 84%RA-->100%NRB.  Guaiac +.  ABG 7.27/51/174.  He
refused intubation and was placed on BIPAP.  He received ASA,
Lasix 40mg IV, nitro gtt, dilaudid 1mg, ativan 1mg, benadryl,
10U regular insulin.
.
In the MICU, he required BIPAP initially but was weaned to 2L NC
and eventually to RA.  Echo showed no change from prior.  On
steroids and azithromycin for history of COPD.  He was diuresed
with 80 IV lasix, putting out 5 liters net in 3 days and 1.6
liters on the day of transfer. He also had altered mental status
with a normal head CT, but he was found to have a R occipital
mass/hematoma on CT, stable since [**2152**]; the patient refused US
of this lesion. He was transfused 1 unit pRBCs when Hct dropped,
then refused further blood draws. He was also placed on CIWA
scale for EtOH withdrawal.
.
ROS negative for fever, chills, palpitations, n/v/d, dysuria,
other Sx of concern to him. + for CP, SOB, cough.

TTE [**9-19**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The inferior vena cava is
dilated (>2.5cm). The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include with
inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study of [**2153-8-21**], left ventricular
function now appears improved. Of note, patient in sinus rhythm
for the current study (in aflutter with rapid ventricular
response in prior study).
.
[**11-18**] MIBI
1. Interval development of moderate reversible inferiolateral
perfusion defect.  2. Left ventricular enlargement, again
slightly worse with stress than rest.  3. Global hypokinesis
with ejection fraction of 25%, decreased compared to the prior
study, when it was 32%.

Angioectasia in the stomach body (thermal therapy)
Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to mid jejunum
.
Head US: The region of interest could not be adequately
evaluated with ultrasound due to the presence of thick overlying
hair in the region.  This area could be better evaluated with a
MRI examination.
.
Head CT:
1.  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

2.  Hyperdense mass again demonstrated in the right occipital
soft tissues, also seen on the study of [**2152-4-29**].  While this
appearance is consistent with a hematoma, it would seem most
unlikely that a hematoma is still present over the long interval
between scans, without expected evolution to lower density
material or regression. Correlate for history of recent trauma,
and also correlate with direct physical examination.  If
desired, further evaluation with son[**Name (NI) 867**] or MR study could be
considered to exclude other pathology.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: This is a 57 y/o M w/ h/o CHF (EF 20-30%), CAD, h/o gastric
AVM with frequent GI bleeds who presented with SOB, likely due
to CHF.
.
#) CHF exacerbation. Refused intubation in ED. Initially
received BiPAP in the MICU with stable ABG's which was changed
to NC. He tolerated NC overnight with good O2 sats. Was on nitro
gtt to afterload reduce and bring down BP that was then titrated
off.  He was given lasix 80 mg IV for net neg 1L q day. With
improvement in respiratory status he was transferred to floor.
He was continued on IV lasix.  His SOB improved and his lung
exam was clear, although he continued to have significant LE
edema.  He was weaned off oxygen without difficulty.  His lasix
was changed to PO when he had a bump in Cr that suggested
patient had been adequately diuresed. The patient was
non-compliant with fluid resriction and diet restriction and was
frequently seen getting food and water from the kitchen.
BB was initially held due to remote cocaine use and repeated GI
bleeds with low Hct, however, pt. developed a-fib with RVR and
was started on lopressor for rate control.  Given patient's h/o
cocaine use and non-compliance he was switched back to diltiazem
for rate control in preparation for d/c.  Started dilt 90mg qid
ACEI was held given ARF.  His lasix was held prior to discharge
given bump in Cr. This should be titrated for SOB and not LE
edema.
.
#) Afib: Patient has history of atrial fibrillation in the past
with cardioversion.  During the hospitalization he converted
from NSR to a fib with RVR.  Initially given BB for rate control
without significant effect and then switched to diltiazem with
HR in 80s-90s.  PCP does not feel pt. is candidate for coumadin
and patient refused to be on anticoa
