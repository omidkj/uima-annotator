History of Present Illness:
55F w/ DM2, CKD not yet on HD, dCHF, COPD, OSA who presents with
hematemesis and bloody stool.  Fell down yesterday and hit her
abdomen, was initially complaining of abdominal pain in the
emergency department.  She states she was supposed to start
hemodialysis soon.

In the ED, initial VS were:  97.4 64 126/46 16 96%.  Stool was
maroon on guaiac.  NG lavage with 500cc no blood, some bile.
Receiving FFP 1 unit, vitamin K 10mg, no PRBC given due to
delay.  PPI drip started.  Ocreotide started, but then stopped
when history was obtained.  CXR shows pulmonary edema
questionable consolidation.  She received levofloxacin.  CT
abd/pelvis no acute intraabdominal process or hemorrhage.
Transplant surgery evaluated the patient (she recently had a
fistula), no surgical intervention needed.  GI consulted and
suggested likely EGD in AM.  Most recent set of vitals 96.7F,

EGD
[**2131-9-6**] - IMPRESSION
Erythema and friability in the stomach body compatible with
erosions, possibly from NG suction trauma
Erythema and friability in the duodenum compatible with mild
duodenitis
Polyp in the stomach body
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Colonoscopy:
[**2131-9-7**] - IMPRESSION
Polyps in the transverse colon
Polyp in the descending colon
Blood in the whole colon
An area of active bleeding with pulsation was located in the
cecum. Four clips were applied to this area after which
hemostasis was confirmed by visualization.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

Brief Hospital Course:
55 y/o w/ DM2, HTN/HLD, afib on coumadin, end stage renal
disease (not yet on HD), presents  w/ nausea, vomitting,
reported hematemesis and maroon stool, and was found to have a
cecum AVM
.
# GI bleed: Pt presented with HCT of 17.4.  She was admitted to
MICU.  The source of bleeding was initially unclear.  Pt was
first placed on PPI gtt, intubated for airway protection and
underwent EGD.  EGD did not review active source of bleed other
than possible NGT trauma.  Pt underwent colonoscopy on the
second day, which reviewed Cecum AVM and was subsequently
clipped by GI.  She received a total of 8 units of pRBC, and 3
units of frozen plasma for hemodynamic stability.  After the
procedure, her HCT remained stable.
.
# Hypoxemia: Pt was intubated initially for airway protection.
She continued to require mechanical ventilation for 5 days, most
likely secondary to fluid overload from transfusion.
Contributing factors leading to her hypoxemia include OSA,
reactive airway disease and possible Vent Assoc Pneumonia for
which she received Vancomycin for 8 days total.
.
# Fever: Pt spiked a fever to 101.3 while she was on the
ventilator.  Sputum culture showed GPC in clusters.  She was
initially treated with Vancomycin, Tobramycin and Aztreotam. The
sputum culture speciated to Staph aureus sensitive to oxicillin.
 tobramycin and aztreotam were discontinued afterwards.  She
continued on Vancomycin for total of 8 days.
.
# ESRD: Pt has ESRD, already considering hemodialysis.  We
experdiated the placement of HD-tunnel line in the setting of
fluid overload.  Hemodialysis were performed at bedside for
fluid removal.
.
# HTN: Pt has documented history of hypertension.  We held her
metoprolol, hydralazine and amlodipine in the setting of GIB.
Her blood pressure medication were slowly resumed after
achieving hemodynamic stability. Only metoprolol was added back
on.

# Atrial fibrillation: Pt had documented history of atrial
fibrillation, and on coumadin at home.  We reserved her INR
initially in the setting of GIB.  We continued to hold coumadin
until readdressing this as an outpatient. When metoprolol 25mg
PO BID was restarted, she returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm.
.
# DM2: was hypoglycemic at times, and thus initially held her
home 75/25 standing insulin but then retarted this of roughly
half of her home dose. This can be further titrated once she
leaves the hospital if her sugars are elevated.
.
# Depression: continued paroxetine
.
Transitions of care:
- GI appointment to address polyps and future C-scope as well as
to address decision about anticoagualation with pradaxa vs. asa
vs. coumadin.
- As she was hypoglycemic at times during the admission, we
initially held her home 75/25 standing insulin but then retarted
this of roughly half of her home dose. This can be further
titrated once she leaves the hospital if her sugars are
elevate
