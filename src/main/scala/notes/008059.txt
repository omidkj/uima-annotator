Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6088**]
Chief Complaint:
retroperitoneal hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Evacuation of left retroperitoneal hematoma and
arterial exploration.

Return to the operating room for control of bleeding

History of Present Illness:
:85F with significant CAD and s/p CABG in [**2148**] hx of diastolic
heart failure presents from OSH for cardiac catheterization for
planned stenting of LM to LCx. During procedure patient recieved
7000U hep bolus and had a 6F Arterial sheath and 5 french venous
sheath. The arterial site was closed with perc close device.  Pt
was out of the room at 5pm and between 7 and 9 pm patient was
hypotensive to systolic of 70-80 and dropped her HCT to 19 from
a
pre-op HCT of 30.  These issues prompted a CT scan which
revealed
a large left-sided RP hematoma. Patient received 2 units of
blood
and the patients BP rose to 100 systolic. vascular surgery
consulted for RP hematoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
Cardiac catheterization was performed via arterial and venous
punctures in the left groin.  COMMENTS:     1. Planned PCI of
Left Main and LCX.
2. Stenting of LM and LCX with Xience 4x28mm stent posted to 4.5
mm in
left main ostium. 3. Groin closure with Mynx device.  Post cath
patient had a vagal
episode during venous sheath removal.  She remained with
borderline BP
for several hours and a repeat HCT went from 26 to 19.  A CT
scan
confirmed retroperitoneal bleed and she was transferred to CCU
for
transfusion and monitoring.

The decision to explore the patient initially was based on
continued hemodynamic instability requiring pressors.  Hct
remianed 20 despite total of 8 units of blood transfused over
approximately 4-6 hours.  She had a noncontrast CT after 2 units
that showed the beginnings of a retroperitoneal hematoma.  Her
groin had no hematoma so my thought was that the only place to
sequester that many transfused units was in the retroperitoneum.
 She was quite obese.  In the OR she had a relatively small RP
hematoma and after underway her 1st intraop Hct came back at 35
(despite no further transfusions).  There was no external iliac
artery injury and no arterial bleeding coming from under the
inguinal ligament.  We controlled some minor venous bleeding
points and closed with the supposition that based on now stable
hemodynamics, Hct of >35 that there was no ongoing source and
that the 2nd Hct was likely in error.  Soon postop, her JP drain
began to put out large quantities despite attempts to correct
coagulopathy. She was immediately re-explored.  She was more
unstable this time and nearly arrested in the OR.  Large
retorperitoneal hematoma encountered this time with bleeding
coming from under inguinal ligament (still no groin hematoma).
Groin was opened and small arterial puncture site just under the
lower edge of the inguinal ligament (no sign of Mynx closure
device) was repaired with single prolene stitch.  The inguinal
ligament was mobilized slightly to get at it.

She was able to wean off of most pressors and eventually all
pressors by 48 hrs after she was cardioverted out of Afib.  We
had discussion about Plavix / ASA and this was restarted by
consensus 24 hours postop.  No further bleeding.  Oliguria / ATN
renal failure attributed to recent dye load and shock.  Echo
showed good left heart function.  Seemed to be about to turn the
corner until 24 hours prior to death when she started to behave
more septic, again into afib with more pressor requirements.  CT
showed bilateral pneumonias as only potiential source for
infection.  ABX were changed accordingly. Patient had persistant
thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology.  Final event was rapid
Afib (previously rate controlled), hypotension that ensued
quickly degraded to non-cardiovertable asystole.  Resuscitation
efforts were stopped when echo showed no heart movement
(~15minutes total).
