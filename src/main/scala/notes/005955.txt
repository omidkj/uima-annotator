Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension and transfer from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital for cardiac
catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with placement of stent in LAD.
[**9-10**]: failed PTCA attempt (RCFA 8F)
[**9-11**]: PTCA of LAD (RCFA 6F)
[**9-15**]: R fem-plantar thrombectomy


History of Present Illness:
85 y/o male with h/o CAD s/p 4VCABG in [**2106**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to
D2 with jump graft to OM, and SVG to RCA), CHF (EF 45%), T2DM,
HTN, and PVD, with multiple recent admissions for cath with
stenting, last from [**Date range (1) 14629**] at which time cath revealed known
occluded LIMA-LAD with non-flow limiting lesions in other
grafts, and a discrete 90% stenosis of D1 that was ballooned,
presenting from [**Hospital 882**] hospital with concern for STEMI.
.
He was recently discharged on [**9-2**], with hospital course
notable, in addition to POBA of D1, for persistent CK elevation
with normal MBI, thought to be myositis secondary to statin use
and his statin was discontinued.  He also had an episode of
AVNRT and was loaded on digoxin, however this was discontinued
on discharge.
.
He was transferred back to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**9-2**], where he was
reportedly doing well until the morning of transfer, when he was
noted to be hypotensive to systolic of 60s.  He was taken to
[**Hospital1 882**] ED where initial vitals were T 96.4, BP 76/48, HR 80,
98% on RA.  An EKG reportedly revealed ST depressions with TWI
in V2-V3.  A CXR showed CHF.  Troponin T was 0.34 which is
actually decreased from 1.74 on discharge.  He was given an [**Hospital1 **]
and started on a heparin drip.  Labs were notable for mildly
elevated creatinine of 1.2, hct 28.9, mild leukocytosis at 11.
A UA was positive and he was given unasyn as well as gentamicin
due to concern for urosepsis.  He was given 1.5 liters of IVF.
The heparin drip was discontinued as ischemia was felt to be
less likely at that point.  However, on the morning of [**9-10**], the
patient was still hypotensive, with new ST elevations in V1-V3,
as well as a troponin elevation to 5.7.  He was restarted on a
heparin drip and arrangments were made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for
catheterization.
.
Catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] on the day of transfer revealed
markedly elevated right and left sided filling pressures (PCWP
32, PA 60/28), as well as new 100% in stent stenosis of the LAD.
 Unfortunately the lesion was difficult to cross and the
procedure was aborted after 78 minutes of fluoro time and 230 cc
of contrast, with plans for possible re-catheterization the next
day.  The patient was given 40 mg IV lasix in the cath lab, and
another 40 mg IV lasix on arrival to the CCU, with almost 2 L
urine output within 2 hours of CCU arrival.
.
The patient himself seemed somewhat confused. He denies any
recent chest pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness.  He
does complain of right leg pain.

well as POBA to D1 in [**8-13**].
2) HTN
3) Hyperlipidemia
4) SVT
5) PVD
6) T2DM
7) CHF, EF 40-45%
8) Prostate CA (treated w/ Lupron injections, seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], most recent PSA 12.6)

Social History:
Per prior notes, former [**Company 2318**] engineer, works as [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Hospital1 14630**].  He lives with his wife and oldest son.  [**Name (NI) **] has never
smoked tobacco or used illicit substances. He denies current
EtOH.

CXR: [**2116-9-10**]
FINDINGS:  Heart, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
Lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or
heart failure.
The patient is status post sternotomy.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process, unchanged
compared to previous study.  No pneumonia or heart failure.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2116-9-10**]:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated severe three vessel native coronary artery disease.
 The
left main demonstrated an ostial 30% lesion unchanged from prior

catheterization.  The LAD was heavily calcified throughout with
a 100%
occlusion in the previously patent coronary artery stent.  The
LCX and
RCA were totally occluded as demonstrated in previous
catheterizations.
2.  Arterial conduit arteriography was not performed as the
LIMA-LAD
graft was known to be atretic and occluded at the site of
anastomosis.
The SVG to distal RCA was widely patent.  The SVG to OM1 and D2
was
patent and unchanged from the previous catheterization.
3.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated severely elevated
right
and left heart filling pressures (RVEDP = 18 mmHG and LVEDP = 29
mmHg).
There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve upon
pullback
from the left ventricle to the aorta.
4.  LV ventriculography was deferred.
5.  Angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery
as
described in the PTCA portion of this report.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute anterior myocardial infarction.
3. Angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery
as
described in the PTCA portion of this report.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2116-9-11**]:
COMMENTS:     Successful angioplasty of the left anterior
descending
coronary artery with a 1.5mm balloon and a 2.5mm balloon
followed by
stenting with a 2.5x8mm MicroDriver (bare metal stent) deployed
at 12
atm.  See PTCA comments for details.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful angioplasty and stenting of the mid left anterior
descending coronary artery with a 2.5x8mm MicroDriver bare metal
stent.
.
Echo [**2116-9-12**]

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Moderately depressed
LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic root. Moderately dilated
ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate ([**2-10**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed. Distal septal and
apical akinesis and inferior hypokinesis are present.
2. The aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-10**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-8-25**],
there is
probably no significant change.
