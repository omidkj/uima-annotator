Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo F with DMII, HTN, COPD who presented to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] as an OSH transfer for 2 weeks of shortness of breath,
fever, and cough productive of yellow sputum.
.
At 03:15 on [**2199-1-26**], the patient was noted by her RN who was in
her room to begin seizing (no seizure history). She was given
Ativan 2 mg IV x 2, and found to be non-responsive. She was
noted to be desaturating, and given her DNI status, was placed
on a non-rebreather.  An ABG done with the patient on the
non-rebreather showed a marked acidosis: 7.11/132/397/45. An EKG
done at that time showed NSR. The family was called.  The
seizure was felt to be secondary to acidemia and hypercarbia vs.
PFO with embolus vs. mass lesion or other CNS event. Given the
goals of care decided by the patient's family, the patient was
made CMO later on [**2199-1-26**], and a morphine drip was initiated.
The patient expired at 3:05 PM on [**2199-1-26**] with her family
present.
.
Below is her detailed hospital course by problem.
.
She was found to be in respiratory distress with fever. She had
a h/o COPD/Asthma requiring oral steroids at home. Per
documentation, patient had a fever to 102, cough productive of
yellow sputum, and shortness of breath x 1 week for which she
completed a 5 day course of Levaquin without improvement in
symptoms. An ABG at OSH suggested chronic CO2 retention and a
CXR did not demonstrate a consolidation or infiltrate. Concern
for a pulmonary infection with resulting COPD exacerbation was
high at the time of admission. She was treated with steroids,
ipratropium and albuterol nebs, and antibiotics. Initially she
was placed on vancomycin and ceftrixone for HAP, but as culture
data was unrevealing, and our suspicion for CAP became  higher,
these were switched to Azithromycin. The patient was doing well
on ICU day #2, with resolution of her fever and improvement in
her respiratory status.
.
On presentatation to the OSH, the patient was noted to be
tachycardic-and remained tachycardic here to the 120's. ECG
demonstrates sinus tachycardia. She did not receive any IVF's or
nodal agents at the OSH given concern for her uncertain h/o
heart failure. Her tachycardia seemed c/w COPD exacerbation with
possible concomitant infection, a repeat EKG showed no acute
changes. Her heart rate was noted to improve with resolution of
her fever and improvement of her respiratory status.
.
She was also hypertensive on presentation to 170's per report
from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**]. She did not receive any medication for her
hypertension and this was also noted to resolve with treatment
of her COPD exacerbation.
.
The patient was a type II diabetic: unknown HgbA1c.
Diet-controlled at home, but received high dose steroids at
[**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] for COPD exacerbation, so was maintained on QACHS
fingersticks and Humalog SS.
.
CHF (EF unknown): Patient with unknown/uncertain history of
congestive heart failure. No recent echocardiograms, not on any
cardiac medications at home aside from a statin. ECG
demonstrates RBBB. She was continued on her home Zocor 10mg PO
qHS.
