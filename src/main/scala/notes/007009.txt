Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 158**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachycardia, post-op


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
open abdominal colectomy with ending ileostomy and
cholecystectomy [**3-12**]


History of Present Illness:
34 year-old male with a history of profound retardation and
severe constipation that was not amendable to medical management
with use of weekly recatal drainage with various enemas. History
significant for 30lb weight loss and 10lb weight gain in the
setting of constipation. He was taken to the OR today for an
open abdominal colectomy with ending ileostomy and
cholecystectomy.

Post operatively, his HCT dropped from 30 to 24 and after he was
extubated his heart rate increased to the 140s-150s. He was on
intermittent fentanyl for pain and haldol 1mg Q1H for agitation
causing helping decrease his HR to 120s. He was thought to be
dry and was volume resuscitated with 7L crystalloid, 500cc
albumin, and 1 unit PRBCs. In the PACU, his BPs remained stable
in the 90s/50s and his respiratory status was stable. He has an
epidural, foley and abdominal binder in place.

He was hospitalized [**2164-11-29**] for abdominal distension and poor
p.o. intake, found to have a massive dilation of his colon with
air fluid level and a transition point in the distal sigmoid
colon, decompressed with rectal tube and follow up colonoscopy
showed a dilated colon without obstructing mass.

On the floor, he was sleeping, and appeared comfortable with his
mom and sister by the bedside. He was tachycardic to 130, with a
distended abdomen.


Past Medical History:
Mental Retardation, GERD, Aortic Stenosis, bicuspid valve,
Anxiety, Constipation, Seizures


Social History:
Single, lives with his family, can communicate with sign
language. Sister and family very involved with his care.

Family History:

Imaging:
CXR [**2165-3-13**]:
There is moderate distention of the stomach. Bibasilar opacities
consistent with atelectasis, larger on the left side, have
markedly worsened. There is small amount of free air in the
abdomen and upright radiograph can be obtained for further
evaluation. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is no
pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions. Right PICC remains
in place.

ECHO [**2165-3-14**]: Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
interatrial septum is aneurysmal. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests
normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The severity of aortic regurgitation may be
underestimated. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Bicuspid
aortic valve with cusps at 1 and 7 o'clock. Mild aortic
stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation. The interatrial septum
bows towards the right atrium suggesting elevated left atrial
pressures. A PFO/ASD is not seen but cannot be excluded on the
basis of this study.

CT ABD and PELVIS [**2165-3-14**]: IMPRESSION:

Moderate pneumoperitoneum and intra-abdominal free fluid
consistent with
postoperative change. No enhancement of the peritoneum to
suggest infected
ascites. Small amount of clot seen dependently in both flanks.

CTA CHEST [**2165-3-14**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Moderately severe bilateral lower lobe atelectasis
accompanied by
moderately large pleural effusions.
2. Bilateral upper lobe peribronchial consolidation and
centrilobular nodules suggest either aspiration or evolving
pneumonia.
3. Pulmonary edema.
4. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

[**2165-3-16**] CXR PA & LATERAL: Interval improvement in interstitial
edema.

[**2165-3-17**] ABDOMEN SUPINE & ERECT X-RAY: Limited study. There is
significant free air, presumably due to recent surgery. The
bowel gas pattern is nonspecific but may represent postoperative
ileus. Bowel obstruction cannot be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
34 year-old male with severe MR, chronic constipation unable to
be managed medically now s/p colectomy transferred to the
intensive care unit for management of post-op course who
required intubation on POD#4 for desats.

# Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated on the morning
of [**2165-3-14**] for persistent desaturations to the high 70's, and
his blood gas showed an A-a gradient concerning for PE, but his
CTA was negative. CTA did show atelectasis, pleural effusions,
and aspiration versus developing pneumonia. Sputum gram stain
showed 3+ gram negative diplococci, 2+ gram positive cocci in
pairs and chains, and 2+ gram negative rods.  He was started on
Vancomycin and Zosyn. He was extubated on [**2165-3-15**] after having a
RISB of 63.  He diuresed well after a single dose of Lasix 20 mg
IV.  He was transferred to the surgical floor for further
management of his post-op care. Upon transfer his pulmonary
issues resolved and he was continued on IV antibiotics. His
sputum culture speciated Moraxella catarrhalis and
Methacillin-sensitive Staph aureus and the ID team recommended
PO/liquid formulations of Linezolid and Azithromycin to be
continued for a total of two weeks, which he will continue on
discharge. His CXR showed stability and the improvement of
pulmonary atelectasis and focal infiltrate over his hospital
stay.
.
# S/P Colectomy: The patient is now s/p colectomy for chronic
constipation.  He tolerated the procedure well and was volume
resuscitated, however his CT from [**2165-3-13**] showed a large amount
of free air with a DDx of post-op changes, contained
perforation, or infection.  He spiked fevers overnight on
[**2165-3-13**] to 101.6 and his WBC trended up.  His WBC count then
stabilized, his fever curve has trended down, and he was
afebrile throughout the rest of his course. His pain was
controlled with IV medication and an epidural which was removed
prior to transfer from the ICU. He likely has adrenal
insufficiency as his ACTH stimulation test did not show any
increase in cortisol level, and he was started on stress dose
steroids of hydrocortisone 50mg IV Q6H. This was tapered and
another [**Last Name (un) 104**] stimulation test was performed once he was
transferred to the floor. His cortisol was reassurin
