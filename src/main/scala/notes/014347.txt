Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Necrotic second right toe

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. S/P angioplasty and stenting in the right LE on [**6-22**]
2. [**2198-6-29**]: Right 3rd toe ray amputation
3. [**2198-6-22**]: Right transmetatarsal amputation with vac placement

History of Present Illness:
87 y/o female with PMH significant for PVD who was admitted to
the vascular surgery service on [**6-21**] who is now transferred to
medicine after suffering a NSTE MI and a GI bleed. Pt was
admitted with a nonhealing foot ulcer on her right foot and a
gangrenous toe. Pt underwent angiography of the right on [**6-22**].
This showed a patent CFA and profunda. The SFA and popliteal
were diffusely diseased. AT with multiple regions of stenosis
along its length. There was also an occluded distal AT and
reconstitution of the distal DP an dlateral tarsal. The PT and
peroneal were occluded. The pt underwent PTA of the entire AT
with a 3x10 balloon. Pt had recanalization of distal AT and DP
artery with a PTA with a 2x2 balloon. The procedure went well
and the pt was started on ASA and plavix postop. In the early
morning of [**6-23**], the pt's postop course was complicated by
rapid atrial fib. Cardiology was consulted and per their recs,
her beta blocker was increased to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], electrolytes were
followed closely, and an echo was checked. This showed a LVEF of
50%, 3+ MR, and 3+ TR. The pt's troponin started to trend up at
this time going from 0.09 to 0.1 on [**6-24**]. A podiatry consult
was obtained on [**6-25**] for evaluation/treatment of right second
toe gangreen with cellulitis. Plans were made to amputate the
toe on [**6-27**] but the pt was not cleared by cardiology and her
stools became guiac positive. It was noted that over the
hospitalization her Hct had fallen from 33 to 22. She had been
transfused 3 units of PRBC during the stay. A GI consult was
obtained and plans were made for the pt to undergo and EDG and
colonoscopy. Given these ongoing issues, the pt will be
transferred to the medicine service for further care.

Past Medical History:
1. Anemia
2. S/P right LE bypass
3. Cataracts
4. S/P removal of cyst on the left arm
5. Bilateral carotid stenosis

Cardiology:
[**2198-6-28**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: severe aortic stenosis; at least moderate-to-severe
mitral
regurgitation; low normal left ventricular ejection fraction

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Right Foot Ulcer:
Patient was admitted to hospital on [**2198-6-21**] for right foot
non-healing ulcer. The patient was originally admitted to the
vascular surgery service for which she underwent a right
angioplasty of the right AT on [**2198-6-22**]. Podiatry service was then
consulted got gangrenous 2nd right toe. However, in setting of
these procedures patient had a rapid HR without drop in BP which
was assessed to be likely MAT for which lopressor was increased
to 25 [**Hospital1 **] and advised to keep aggressive repletion of Mg and
Potassium, and diurese more aggressively. While planning for
right toe amputation,on [**2198-6-27**] the patient was found to be
troponin positive as well as with dropping Hct and guaiac
positive for which GI was consulted.  However, the patient was
unable to tolerate her golytely prep and did not receive a
colonoscopy as planned on [**2198-6-28**]. In the setting of a possible
NSTEMI and GI bleed, the patient was transferred to the medicine
service for continued care. The patient's right foot was noted
to have pus expressed from the foot and was opened at the
bedside. The patient underwent a right 3rd toe amputation, which
she tolerated. EGD performed on [**2198-7-2**] demonstrated the patient
to have no active bleeding. However in the setting of ongoing
tachycardia, a colonoscopy was aborted. After this procedure the
patient's HCt had stabilized without need for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] or other
diagnostic procedures. However, post operatively the patient's
course was complicated by ongoing fluid overload and pulmonary
edema. However, attempts to diurese the patient were limited as
her creatinine continued to rise and the patient was noted to be
oliguric. The patient continued to remain fluid overloaded. The
patient's antibiotic coverage for her toe ulcer was originally
Zosyn, to which Vancomycin was added for Coag Positive Staph
