History of Present Illness:
 Mr. [**Known lastname 9723**] is a 69 yo M with h/o chronic systolic CHF (EF 20%)
[**3-13**] ischemic cardiomyopathy (severe 3VD), severe pulm HTN (on
sildenafil and milrinone gtt), severe TR, and recurrent ascites
[**3-13**] CHF requiring paracentesis q2 weeks who presents with
weakness and muscle cramping x5-6 days. He is poor historian,
most details of history come from ED report. Patient's symptoms
started 5-6 days ago after his most recent paracentesis.
Yesterday he accidentally took three times his usual dose of
sildenafil (took 60mg). This morning he complained of
orthostatic dizziness and nosebleed after getting up from a nap;
otherwise in usual state of health. Wife checked his BP when he
felt dizzy, was normal (118/50). Per his family, he has become
slower to respond to questions, but has not seemed confused or
disoriented. No increased/decreased fluid intake or changes in
urine/stool output. He has also been having leg cramps (chronic,
but worse than baseline). He has baseline nonproductive cough
which has not worsened, no increased shortness of breath or leg
swelling. His weight is currently down to 115 lbs (baseline 122,
sinusoidal, varies by ~5kg based on volume removal with
paracentesis); per wife he has gained 2.5 lbs over past day or
so.
.
Per recent cardiology notes, patient has had progressively
worsening hyponatremia over the past two weeks weeks in setting
of his worsening end-stage CHF. On [**7-16**] sodium was 125, and on
[**7-23**] sodium was 124. On [**7-23**] he had a 5L paracentesis. His wife
has recently increased his Torsemide to 100mg daily (feels 80mg
daily is "not enough").
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.4 109/63 74 18 100% RA. Pt
[**Name (NI) 9830**]3 though slow to respond to questions. Exam notable for loud
systolic murmur, JVD to mandible, ascites, no LE edema. Labs
notable for Na 120, creatinine 2.4 (baseline 1.72-2.6 over past
several weeks), glucose 255, Posm 289, BNP 3621 (has been as
high as 3972 in past). CXR showed low lung volumes, head CT
showed no acute intraparenchymal changes. Unable to obtain urine
sample in ED. Patient was admitted to MICU for workup of
hyponatremia. Vitals prior to transfer:
.
On arrival to MICU, vitals are: 98.0 103/75 86 18 100% RA.
Patient AAOx3, slow to respond to questions (native language is
Pakistani). He endorses hunger and thirst, also complains of BL
leg pain. Repeat labs on arrival to MICU show Na 122, Posm 289,
Uosm 279.
.
His sodium initially improved from 120->122->124 with fluid
restriction alone, so in ICU he was restarted on home meds
(Torsemide, Spironolactone, Milrinone) and home 1.5L fluid
restriction and low-salt diet. After he was restarted on home
regimen, his sodium again fell again, suggesting overdiuresis on
home regimen and hypovolmeic hyponatremia. His toresmide dose
was decreased from 100 to 80mg daily.
.
Patient was also noted to have 4/4 bottles growing GPCs thought
to be due to his PICC line through which milrinone was
administered and this was pulled. Patient had been receiving
Vancomycin for treatment of line-associated bacteremia.
.
The patient denied shortness of breath, chest pain, and muscle
cramping.  He was called out to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service given relative
resolution of his hyponatremia.
.
On [**8-3**] at 1600 hours, CCU contact[**Name (NI) **] by [**Name (NI) 1516**] resident as patient
was hypotensive to the 60's mmHg systolic.  Throughout the day
SBP's had been in the 100-120mmHg range.  About 1500 hours,
patient's milirnone gtt was stopped due to vancomycin
administration.  Also given 2.5 mg lisinopril at that time.  An
hour later noted to have hypotension in the 60's mmHg systolic.
Bolused 250 cc NS.  Peripheral dopamine started and uptitrated
to 15 mcg/kg/hr.  Family meeting at bedside reinforced DNR/DNI
status with pt's wife [**Name (NI) 382**] as well as his two sons.  ICD turned
off by cardiology fellow at the bedside given DNR/DNI status.
Family requested pressor support, necessitating ICU transport
for central line and arterial line.  BP prior to transport was
86/50.
.
In the CCU, patient is mentating well communicating in his
language (Pakistani) with his family.  Tachycardic to 120's on
dopamine gtt, SBP 90's/50's on NIBP.
