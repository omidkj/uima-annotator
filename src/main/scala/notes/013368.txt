History of Present Illness:
87 year old female with hx of COPD, DVT on coumadin, recent
urosepsis which needed ICU admission, who presents with
worsening dyspnea.
.
[**Name6 (MD) **] rehab RN, the pt was wheezing and had respiratory rate
35/min, P-100, BP 110/60, POx 96% on 3 liters by NC.  The
patient's daughter reports no fevers or cough but she has
noticed pt to be "sweaty and shaky" and "not herself" over the
prednisone, ceftriaxone and nebulizers for presumed COPD
exacerbation. She continued to have wheezing and therefore was
brought to the ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial VS were 99.8 88 133/74 32 96%RA.  Given CTX,
Azithro.  CXR showed LLL opacity.  Given solumedrol.  She
continued to be tachypneic in mid to high 20's. VS prior to
transfer were afebrile 141/67 81 25 95%3L.

IMAGING:

CXR: Subtle opacity in the left mid-to-lower lung could
represent  atelectasis though the possibility of an early
pneumonia cannot be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
87yo F with advanced Alzhiemer's, COPD, recent ICU admission,
and recurrent UTIs, who was sent in from rehab with worsening
dyspnea.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
Dyspnea: The patient has not had cough but some wheezes on exam
to suggest COPD exacerbation. Chest x-ray shows atelectasis vs
PNA. Patient has a history of aspiration and that may be a
component as well, and her past history of DVT raised the
possibility of PE, but it was ultimately discounted.  Ultimately
we felt that the pt was suffering from a COPD flair, for which
we started her on anitbiotics and steroids, both of which should
be continued as an outpatient.  Abx should be continued for 5
days, last dose on [**2195-10-18**]. Can taper steroids as clincially
indicated.
.
Anemia: The pt's hematocrit had an unexplained drop on [**10-13**] from
28.1 to 26.8.  The pt had no signs of bleeding elsewhere, and in
review of her past history, 26.8 is consistent with her prior
levels done in [**Month (only) **].  This should be followed as an outpatient
to ensure that she doesn't have any signs of symptoms of
bleeding.
.
Myoclonic Jerks: These were likely related to toxic/metabolic
process. Previous notes document that the patient had these
during her acute illnesses.  While here the jerks became less
noticable and ultimately self aborted, becoming a non-issue.
.
Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine elevated to 0.8 up from baseline
0.3-0.5, with a corresponding increase in BUN.  our impression
was that this was a pre-renal process likely from her decreased
PO intake due to her dementia.  Here in the ICU we volume
resuscitated her with 1.5L NS and the creatinines improved back
to 0.6.  Her urine electrolytes were unremarkable.
.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
Constipation:
- Continue home bowel regimen
- Additional meds PRN
.
History of DVT: INR slightly subtherapeutic but starting meds
that increase activity of warfarin.
- Continue 2mg daily
- Monitor INR daily and adjust as needed

TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES:
- Continue monitoring swallowing ability daily and transition to
PO medications as tolerated
- Please follow INR every other day while on antibiotics and
adjust warfarin dosing to keep INR [**3-5**]
- Consider tapering steroids after prednisone burst is done
- Insulin sliding scale was added for steroid.  Can taper or
discontinue when taper or discontinue steroids.
- Please monitor PO intake, BP and urine output daily and bolus
500-1000cc NS or LR as needed
- Prednisone and azithro for 5 days for tx of possible COPD
exacerbation
- Outstanding lab results: urine culture from [**10-12**] pending
- Recheck a hematocrit in [**3-5**] days to ensure follow up.
