History of Present Illness:
59 y/o male w/ no sig PMHx presents as transfer from OSH with
complaint of V fib.  Per report, patient was at court arguing a
parking ticket when he syncopized.  Per records, was standing at
courthouse and was leaning against wall   AED was placed which
advised shock which was done with ROSC.  He was taken to the ED
where he went into VT/VF and was shocked [**5-26**] more times and was
given amiodarone/lidocaine as well.  He had a Head CT which was
negative, Cardiac cath which showed clean coronaries, and normal
Echo.  He then went to the EP lab where he was on the table for
several hours in attempt to map his VF.  It appeared that his VF
was initiated with a PVC that was isolated to the right free
wall, near the tricuspid valve.  Ablation was attempted, however
they were unable to terminate the focus.  He was shocked 20-30
more times while on the table in the EP lab.  He was intubated
and sedated in attempt to decrease the frequency of his
arrythmia.  His EF dropped from 60% to 10%.  He was continued on
amiodarone 1mg/hr and lidocaine 2mg/hr, IV metoprolol was
attempted, but he had borderline hypotension and this was
stopped.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further EP evaluation.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient is intubated, sedated, and
was paralyzed for the helicopter ride to [**Hospital1 18**].  He has bloody
gauze over his nose and eyebrow.  A FemStop was initially in
place, this was removed on arrival to the CCU.  Amiodarone was
stopped and the initial plan was to continue lidocaine and wake
the patient in order to get consent for potential ablation,
however when the propofol was weaned the patient went back into
v fib storm around 7:30AM.  This resolved once the propofol was
increased again.  He did well for a few hours however went back
into v fib storm at 10:00AM.  He was started on esmolol at this
time, which was not effective alone.  Then was given quinidine
648mg PO, verapamil 40mg PO, paralyzed with cisatracurium, and
had the propofol increased again.  The patient was not in v fib
for prolonged length of time as he underwent immediate
defibrillation for each episode.
.
Contact was made with the patient's pastor, who was with him
throughout his hospitalization at [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] in [**State 2748**].
The pastor is currently attempting to find contact information
for the patient's family, which he will provide for us.  The
pastor's number is [**0-0-**].  His brother's name is [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 6402**].  The brother's number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 92487**].
.
ROS unable to be obtained secondary to intubated status.
