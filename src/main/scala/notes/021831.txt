EKC [**8-5**]: Baseline artifact. Atrial fibrillation with slow
ventricular response. Right bundle-branch block. Q-T interval
prolongation. ST-T wave
abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2106-8-29**] the rate has
decreased.
The right bundle-branch block pattern and Q-T interval
prolongation are
new. ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent. Clinical
correlation is
suggested.

[**8-7**]: Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
Low precordial lead voltage. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2107-8-5**] the ventricular response is increased. Otherwise, no
diagnostic interim change

CXR [**8-5**]: AP CHEST: Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. The
aorta is tortuous. The lungs are clear without evidence of
effusion, consolidation, or pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: Stable
moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of CHF or pneumonia.

[**8-8**]: FINDINGS: There is no fluid overload. Moderate
cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are unchanged. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are otherwise
normal. There is no pleural effusion. Lungs are clear. Right
PICC line ends in mid-to-lower SVC.
IMPRESSION: No fluid overload. Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged.

B/L LE duplex: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] of
the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, and
popliteal veins
was performed. Normal flow, augmentation, compressibility and
waveforms are
demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus is identified. There is
moderate
subcutaneous edema in both calves as described in the history.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
62yo woman w/ h/o HTN & CHF, h/o ETOH abuse (although she denies
active use), who presented with fatigue, malaise, nausea, found
to have multiple severe electrolyte abnormalities??????hyponatermia,
hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia.

# Hyponatremia: The pt was thought to have hypovolemic
hyponatremia based on her history, low urine Na and response to
NS infusion. Diuretic use and possibly a hyperaldosterone state
were also thought to be contributing. The pt was treated with
normal saline rehydration and her serum Na slowly and
appropriately corrected as did her feelings of malaise. Serum
electrolytes were monitored very closely; initially q2 hours,
then gradually less frequently. A PICC line was placed to allow
for IV hydration and frequent lab draws.  Her PICC was pulled as
the area proximal to its insertion became erythematous, warm,
and edematous.  These skin and soft tissue changes reosolved
after its removal.  The patient's Na rose to 133 prior to
discharge.

#Hypokalemia/Hypomag/Hypophos: These were again thou
