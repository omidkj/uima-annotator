Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, weight gain, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
78 y/o F with hx of CHF, likely secondary to ischemic
cardiomyopathy, hx of CVA who is now hemiplegic and nonverbal,
who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with increased dyspnea, weight
gain and inability to diurese.  She recently has been changed
from lasix 80 mg PO BID to 40 mg IV BID.  Her SBPs had decreased
slightly to the 90s.  Per the rehab report, her last weight in
[**Month (only) 547**] (presumed dry weight) was 128 lbs.  Now she is 165 lbs.
Over the last three days; when the IV lasix started, her weight
has fluctuated up and down by one pound each day and she
clinically has not improved.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.3, P 84, BP 90/52, R 20, and
93% on 2L.  She received no medications in the ED.  She did
transiently drop her SBPs to the 60s, she was still apparently
arousable and mentating.  She was given 250 cc IVF bolus in the
ED and her SBPs returned to the 90s.  She had recently been
treated for c.diff and the worry for sepsis prompted the MICU
admission.  She received no abx or blood cultures.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient is alert and nods head
sometimes to questions.  Unclear if she understands english, but
nodded "yes" to difficulty breathing and "no" to pain.  She
moans intermittently.

.
Echo [**2106-6-1**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
top normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed with (LVEF= 20 %). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with moderately to severely
depressed free wall contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**11-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is at least moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
effusion.
.
CXR [**2106-6-1**] PA&L IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate right pleural effusion and associated right basilar
opacity,
likely representing atelectasis. Superimposed pneumonia cannot
be excluded.  2. Cardiomegaly and central venous congestion
without frank pulmonary edema. 3. Left PICC extends to the mid
superior vena cava.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old lady with history of congestive heart failure,
likely secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, history of cerebral
vascular event who is now hemiplegic, who presents from [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab with increased dyspnea, weight gain and inability to
diurese.
.
# Heart Failure (CHF) : The presention of weight gain, dyspnea
and pleural effusion on CXR likely secondary to acute on chronic
CHF. The patient was volume overloaded, with bilateral lower
extremity edema and evidence of pulmonary edema and has mild
dyspnea.  CXR unremarkable for florid CHF, except large
effusion.  TSH normal.  The patient has known EF of 20-25% from
recent echo.  Repeat echo on [**6-1**] revealed LVEF of 20%, RV
dysfunction, severe TR and mild/moderate MR. Trigger for heart
failure likely related to new cardiac event, but unclear.  The
patient was diuresed with a lasix drip with initially good urine
output, however diuresis was limited by hypotension (as
described below). The patient's urine output persistently
decreased despite up-titration of the lasix drip. Metalazone was
added to assist with diuresis.  A dopamine drip was considered
to improve diuresis with positive ionotropic support, however
the patient's persitant tachycardia limited its use.  The
patient's breathing became more labored and tachypnic. On HD 4,
the patient's family decided to make her comfort care only,
rather than pursue more invasive measures. The lasix drip and
metalazone were continued, tube feeds were terminated, and
morphine was administered in 1 mg boluses as needed for patient
comfort.   On HD 5 the patient was transferred back to [**Hospital 100**]
rehab.  The medication protocol for [**Hospital1 100**] will be left to the
discretion of the palliative care team there and their
discussions with the family.
.
# Hypotension:  Etiology cardiac shock versus over-diuresis at
prior rehab versus infection.  The etiology likely heart failure
in the setting of underlying CHF, elevated BNP, normal renal
function and electrolytes not indicative of overdiuresis and
positive fluid balance. The patient required a levophed support
on the morning of admission [**6-1**].  With diuresis necessary for
heart failure (see above), pt continued to be in hypotensive
state.  She required addition of Levophed pressor on HD2, which
was again weaned.  Systolic BPs were maintained >80 as long as
patient urinating and mentating.  Of note, cx were all negative.
 Carvedilol and Lisinopril were held while hypotensive.
.
# Hypernatremia: The patient??????s hypernatremia was likely
secondary to severe free water deficit of 3.8L. The patient had
been getting 125 cc free water flushes every 6 hours at [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab which was likely not enough.  The patient was given 3 L of
D5W with free water flushes with correction of serum sodium.
Free water flushes were increased to 300 ml every 6 hours.
Hypernatremia resolved on HD2, and electrolytes were monitored
throughout her stay.
.
# Atrial fibrillation / Tachycardia : The patient is rate
controlled with heart rates in the 90s as an outpatient, but was
persistently sinus tachycardia in ICU.  Would ideally like a HR
in the 70s if possible to optimize filling time.  However, the
patient was hypotensive which made diuresis and rate control
difficult.  On hospital
