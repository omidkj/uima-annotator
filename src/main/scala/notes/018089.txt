Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 51 yo F with h/o Down Syndrome, COPD, hypothyroidism,
central DI, admitted with angioedema and ARF.
.
#Angioedema: During this hospitalization, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was given
steroids, benadryl and H2 blockers which helped to decrease
swelling of lips and tongue.  After a discussion with the
patient and her family, it did not appear that she had recently
started taking any medications or had eaten any new food.
Allergy was consulted who assessed the patient and felt that the
most likely etiology of the angioedema is her ACEI, despite the
fact that she had been on the medication for months.  Her
lisinopril was held.  C4 was normal which ruled out C1 inhibitor
deficiency.  Facial and lip edema improved significantly and Ms.
[**Known lastname **] was extubated on [**7-28**] and transferred to the floor.  Her
course on the floor was uneventful; her facial edema had
resolved.  She was evaluated by speech and swallow and
determined to be able to take thin liquids and soft solids.  A
steroid taper was begun and benadryl was discontinued.
.
#Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with
profound hypercarbic respiratory failure on admission which
resulted in hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was intubated in
the ICU.  Vent was titrated to maintain PCO2 of 50 given history
of COPD.  As her respiratory status improved, pt was extubated
and transferred to the floor satting well on room air.

#ARF: Pt presented to the ED in acute renal failure, likely
secondary to hypotension.  As angioedema was treated and pt
received hydration, the creatinine trended down quickly.  Upon
discharge, her creatinine was at her baseline of 0.8.
.
#Pneumonia: One day after admission, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 28316**] a fever to
102.1.  In light of increasing WBC and worsening CXR, she was
started on a course of Unasyn.  Pt has been afebrile since [**7-26**],
with a stable CXR and WBC trending down.  Once she was able to
take PO, she was switched to Augmentin for a course of 7 days.
(Day 1 [**7-26**]).
.
#Diabetes Insipidus: Patient has history of DI.  She was
continued on outpatient dose of 0.2mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
#Hypothyroidsim: Pt with history of hypothyroidism.  She was
switched to IV levothyroxine during acute episode, but then
switched back to PO.  Dose of levothyroxine was increased as
free T4 was low with elevated TSH.
