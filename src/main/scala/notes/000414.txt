History of Present Illness:
Please see nightfloat admission note for full details of
admission history. In brief, this is a 62yoM with CAD s/p CABG
[**11/2182**], dCHF, ESRD (on HD [**12/2182**] - [**2-6**]), history of DVT & PE
on Coumadin who presented [**3-6**] with AMS and acute on chronic
kidney injury.
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 91915**] for melena
from duodenal ulcer from migration of a metal biliary tract
stent that was exchanged for a new stent. His course was
complicated by septic pancreatic stent, micro bowel perforation,
citrobacter bacteremia, as well as hypoxia from volume overload.
He was ultimately discharged to rehab. Two weeks ago, the
patient developed abdominal pain for two weeks and began having
nausea/vomiting on Monday. He was to have the biliary stent
changed [**2183-3-3**] but missed his appointment due to excessive
vomiting.
.
On [**3-5**], the patient went to the bathroom and had an unwitnessed
fall for unclear reasons. The patient reports he slipped and
fell. Since the fall, the patient had altered mental status and
presented to an OSH with a negative CT head and neck. He was
given vancomycin and zosyn at transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, where
he was 99% NC. Repeat CT head and neck was negative, and
abdominal CT showed no migration of the biliary stent. CXR
showed pulmonary edema but not significantly different from
prior, and trop 0.19, previously 0.26. K was 5.9 without EKG
changes. Cr was 3.9 from 2.5. He remained afebrile. On transfer
to the medicine floor, the patient had HR 101 with 92%3L. He was
delirious and oriented x1 with myoclonic jerks but was
redirectable.
.
The morning of transfer to the MICU, the patient became
tachycardic and became hypoxic. He was transferred to the MICU
for further management.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was breathing comfortably on
4L NC and denied shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, or
other symptoms. However, he was delirious and oriented x1.

Imaging:
Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral akinesis and lateral hypokinesis. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen, stemming from a posterior
mitral leaflet being tethered to the akinetic inferolateral LV
wall. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate to severe ischemic mitral
regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-2-12**],
left ventircular cavity has further dilated, LV function has
deteriorated and amount of mitral regurgitation has increased.
The regional distribution of wall motion abnormalities is quite
similar. Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 1600 hours on
the day of the study.

Approved
1. Unchanged location of biliary stent.
2. Right lower lung consolidation may represent aspiration,
pneumonia, or
worsening atelectasis.
3. Within the limits of a non-contrast study, no acute
intra-abdominal
process. Bilateral adrenal and left renal nodules as described
above.
Consider non-emergent followup.

Preliminary
1. Limited selective coronary angiography of this right dominant
system
revealed three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a
50% ostial
lesion and calcified distal 50% lesion. The LAD was heavily
calcified
and diffusely diseased with 80% ostial lesion; there was
competative
