History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 31102**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo  with MMM who was admitted on [**2155-10-29**]
with a left foot ulcer. She was treated w/ PO abx as outpt
without much improvement and, thus, was admitted for IV abx and
eval for possible osteo.  MR foot on [**11-1**] without clear evidence
of osteo, though it could not be ruled out.  ESR & CRP elevated
in past (not checked on this admission).  Superficial cx + for
MRSA.  Podiatry & vascular consulted.  Non-invasives performed,
revealing severe PVD of left foot.  Angio/possible surgical tx
was being discussed when pt fell while in hospital.

Unfortunately, on [**2155-11-4**], pt found "slumped in bathroom",
apparently after trying to ambulate on her own.  No reported
LOC/loss of bowel or bladder conintence.  Fall thought to be
mechanical.  Head CT showed acute left frontal subdural
hematoma, without evidence of shift of midline structures, as
well as left frontal subgaleal hematoma.  Neurosurgery saw pt,
no intervention recommended.  Anti-coagulants/anti-platelet
agents held.  Platelets transfused (?).  Repeat head CT on [**11-5**]
showed expansion from 4mm to 8mm.  Neurosurg still felt no
intervention necessary given risk.  Repeat scan on [**11-6**] & [**11-7**]
showed stable SDH.

On [**11-7**] PM, following repeat CT head, pt reportedly had
decreased MS, desaturation to 88% on RA, and fevers to 101.9.
Triggered for desaturation to 88% on RA.  O2 sats improved to
92-93% on 2-3L NC.  She was described as rousable to sternal
rub.  Pt given ethacrynic acid to diurese.  Morning of [**11-8**], pt
received her metoprolol, then had BP 70s/30s.  Was noted to be
unrousable to painful stimuli. Peripheral dopamine was started
and the MICU team was contact[**Name (NI) **] for transfer

Pt arrived in MICU on dopamine.  She received bolus of ~1L and
pressure improved to 110s to 120s systolic.  Dopamine was
stopped.  A-line was place.

She was eventually transferred back out to the medicine floor.
She was started on levofloxacin/flagyl for presumed aspiration
PNA and screened for rehab.  She was discharged to rehab the
morning of [**2155-11-29**].

Past Medical History:
1) Diabetes mellitus (Hgb A1C 5.8% in [**2-8**])
2) Frequent UTI
3) Gastroesophageal reflux disease
4) S/p CVA w/residual mild R hemiparesis
5) Osteoporosis
6) Mild cognitive impairment
7) Depression/Anxiety
8) Osteoarthritis
9) Hypothyroidism (last TSH 2.8 in [**11-7**])
10) Chronic diarrhea
11) COPD, on night O2 at home (FEV1 0.88 (73% pred), FVC 1.2,
elevated EV1/VC ratio in [**1-6**]), no prior intubations, was
placed on steroid taper at last admission in [**3-11**].
12)Diastolic CHF
13)Coronary Artery Disease with cath [**1-8**], no intervention
14)s/p admission for fall at home discharged on [**2155-8-29**]


Social History:
Smoked 2ppd until [**2131**]. [**2-4**] glass of wine 3-4x/week. Worked as a
secretary. Independent with ADLs, not IADL. Has 24 hour
caretaker. [**Name (NI) **] (daughter) is the Healthcare proxy.


Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 95.6 HR 74 BP 89/38 R 20 97% 3LNC
Gen: pale, elderly cachectic female lying in bed, does not
respond to voice, but does withdraw to painful stimuli
HEENT: NCAT, sclerae anicteric/noninjected, EOMI, PERRL, OP
clear, uvula midline, dry MM
Neck: JVP ~5 cm, no LAD
CV: distant heart sounds, nl S1/S2, [**2-8**] diastolic and systolic
non radiating murmur noted
Lungs: decreased breath sounds at the bases, otherwise CTA, no
wheezes
Ab: soft, NTND, NABS, no HSM by percussion, no rebound or
guarding
Extrem: no c/c/e
Skin: warm, lef foot, inner surface of big toe w/ mild erythema
surround scabbed area, no fluctance or drainage
Neuro: not speaking, does not allow her eyes to be opened, will
move all extremities when stimulated by pain

Pertinent Results:
[**2155-10-29**] Foot MR - Edema involving the lateral aspect of the
first metatarsal head and to a lesser extent the base of the
first toe proximal phalanx. The appearance is nonspecific.
Considerations include changes related to altered mechanics and
trauma. Osteomyelitis is not excluded.

[**2155-11-4**] CT Head -  Study limited by motion artifact. New acute
left frontal subdural hematoma seen, without evidence of shift
of midline structures. Left frontal subgaleal hematoma.

[**2155-11-9**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] -
1. Left subdural hematoma.
2. No evidence of acute infarct.
3. Marked cerebral atrophy.
4. Multiple nonspecific FLAIR hyperintense foci in the
periventricular and deep white matter likely represent chronic
microvascular ischemic changes.

[**2155-11-24**] CT Head - Appropriate evolution of the left frontal
subdural hematoma without evidence of new hemorrhage.

[**2155-11-25**] LENI -  No deep vein thrombosis seen in either leg.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] F with with COPD on home 02, h/o CVA, DM II, diastolic CHF,
MRSA +, admitted with foot ulcer, hospitalization complicated by
fall w/ SDH, fevers, & worsening mental status.

# SDH: [**Hospital **] hospital course was complicated by SDH which was
sustained s/p fall.  Initial CT showed 4mm hematoma, next CT on
[**11-5**] showed expansion to 8mm, repeats on [**11-6**] & [**11-7**] have been
stable.  Neurosurgery recommended supportive care only. Held
anti-coagulation/anti-platelet agents. Repeated CTs showed no
changes. EEG no signs of seizure ativity. Keppra given for
seizure prophlaxis but stoped as it was thought to be
contributing to MS changes.  Repeat CT scans stable and examined
by neurosurgery.  Patient was restarted on ASA per NSG recs.
She was seen by neurosurgery prior to discharge and had plans to
see them in clinic in [**2-4**] weeks.  At that time the patient will
need a repeat head CT.

# Altered mental status: per family pt has been "unresponsive"/
minimally responsive for two days, since her fall.  At baseline,
pt is interactive & talkative, though demented.  Has been
minimally responsive voice & painful stimili for ~24hr.  [**2155-11-8**]
AM not responding to painful stimuli.  Suspect that some of MS
change is due to effect of SDH, though there is no shift/mass
effect.  Could be some infectious component, though no clear
source apart from her L foot ulcer, which appears to be
improving.  No metabolic abnormalities to explain change.  Could
be related to hypothyroidism. Treated for potential infections.
Pt became more alert without any intervention.  At the time of
discharge, the patient was answering questions with yes or no
answers and following basic commands.

# Hypotension: Patient had episode of hypotension while in the
hospital.  She was transfered to the ICU briefly where she
recieved fluids and was briefly on dopamine.  Thought to be
related to hypovolemia / antihypertension medications.  She was
rehydrated in the MICU and her blood pressures improved.  She
was slowly restarted on her home BP meds as her BP tolerated.

#Pneumonia:  Patient was noted to have episodes of tachypnea and
tachycardia.  Cxray revealed a infiltrate.  Suspicion for
aspiration pneumonia and patient was started on flagyl and
levoquin on [**2155-11-27**].  She will need to complete a 10 day course
(last day should be [**2155-12-6**]).

#Foot ulcer: MRI w/o definitive evidence of osteo.  She will be
treated with a 6 week total course of Vancomycin for the
infection.  Wound swab postive for MRSA.  Course to end on
[**2155-12-10**].  Dosing based on levels (goal vanco trough >15;
currently on q 36hr dosing).

# COPD: on home O2, 2L, w/ baseline 02 sats 90-95% per family.
She was continued on Nebs and O2 as needed while hospitalized.

# CAD: Patient was ruled out during hypotensive episode. Cardiac
enzymes remained negative and her EKGS were without evidence of
acute events. She was continued on ASA but plavix was held per
neurosurgery recs.

# Anemia: Has anemia of chronic disease at baseline--co
