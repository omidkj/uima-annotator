Brief Hospital Course:
An 86 year old (per brothers report, conflicts with [**Name (NI) **])
gentleman with CAD, dementia, atrial fibrillation, and prior
strokes presented with hypotension and respiratory distress from
[**Hospital 882**] hospital.
.
1. Sepsis: The patient was transferred to the MICU hypotensive
and septic from a likely respiratory source based on preliminary
culture data.  The patient was intubated for airway protection,
given fluid resuscitation started on levophed for pressor
support and Vancomycin, Zosyn and Ciprofloxacin were started for
hospital acquired pneumonia.  The patient's blood pressures
remained labile hypo- and hyper-tensive often associated with
bouts of atrial fibrillation to the 120s.  Prior to transfer to
the medical floor the patient was stabily extubated and off
pressures & fluid resuscitation.  His sputum culture showed
pan-sensitive Morganella.  He was initieally covered with
Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Ciprofloxaxin from [**12-31**]. Vanc was stopped
on [**1-4**] and Zosyn stopped [**1-6**]. On the floor, he remained
afebrile with normal white count and satting well on room air.
He completed an eight day course on [**1-8**].
.
2. Likely aspiration event: Per speech and swallow, patient is
very unlikely to safely tolerate anything PO.  He previously had
a G-tube which the patient pulled out.  This was replaced on
[**2163-1-6**].
- He should remain NPO per speech and swallow recommendations.
He is at high risk for aspiration.
- Recommend Altzheimer's clothing to prevent undressing to
prevent this tube from being removed again.
.
3. Acute renal failure:  The patient was admitted with pre-renal
acute on chronic renal failure due to significantly poor PO
intake.  Urine lytes were c/w ATN.
He was fluid resuscitated and his creatinine and urine output
improved while in the ICU.  Nephrology was consulted and did not
see renal replacement as indicated. ACE inhibitor held and all
medication
