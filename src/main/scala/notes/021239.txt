Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia / Hypotension / Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
84 y.o male transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] with hypoxia and
hypotension and fever. Patient was found to have right pleural
effusion  which was tapped yielding approx 400cc of transudative
fluid. Since d/c patient has been doing fairly well, but has
been eating poorly. Wife saw him last night and state that he
was doing well. She reports that he had stated that he was
"cold" over the last few days w/a mild cough. This morning the
patient was found to be hypoxic to 70's, in respiratory
distress. He was brought initially to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] where he was
initially thought to be in CHF. He was given lasix w/minimal
urine output. He was then intubated for continued hypoxia and a
femoral central line was placed. He was noted to be hypotensive
so dopamine was initiated. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED he was on
levophed for his BP. Additionally, he was started empirically on
a heparin gtt for a possible PE as the source of his hypoxia and
hypotension. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED he was given levo/flagyl/vanco and
2Liters of NS boluses for ? sepsis as the source for his
hypotension.

CT scan on [**2119-4-12**]: IMPRESSION:
1) Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Right
lower lobe collapse and partial collapse of the right middle
lobe. Anasarca and small pericardial effusion. These findings
may relate to volume overload, but superimposed infection is not
excluded. Repeat CT scan with contrast is recommended after
treatment to ensure that these findings resolve and to exclude
an underlying obstructive process.
2) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
3) Nodular density in the left upper lobe measuring 1.1 cm in
greatest dimension. Attention to this area on the followup
examination is recommended to exclude malignancy.

[**2119-4-12**] Cardiology Report ECG
Sinus rhythm. A-V conduction delay. Left atrial abnormality.
Occasional
ventricular ectopy. Low limb lead voltage. Prior anterior
myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2114-5-7**] the limb
lead voltage has diminished markedly. Evidence for prior
inferior myocardial infarction or ongoing inferior ischemia is
no longer recorded. There are now ST segment depressions in
leads V4-V6 consistent with active lateral ischemic process,
increase in rate and appearance of ventricular ectopy. Clinical
correlation is suggested.



Brief Hospital Course:
[**2119-4-12**]: Admited to MICU. +UTI/likely urosepsis. ? consolidation
on CXR/CT. Cont vanco/levo/flagyl. Decreased platelets
concerning for DIC. Tube feeds started. A-line placed. Renal
consulted, no evid of need for emergent HD currently.
[**2119-4-13**]: CXR w/evid of CHF w/trops trending upward. ESRD
w/creatinine trending upward. Continued respiratory failure
requiring ventilation. Extremities w/
