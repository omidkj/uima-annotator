Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath/Wheezing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NONE

History of Present Illness:
questionable history of asthma who presented to the ED with
severe SOB and wheezing. She states that she first developed
severe sneezing four days ago. She then developed a cough
yesterday, with minimal amount of yellow sputum production. She
felt SOB beginning yesterday evening. It became very difficult
for her to breath and she was unable to lie down flat. She used
albuterol 2 puffs yesterday evening and this morning with no
relief of her symptoms. She rarely uses albuterol, and is
unclear if she uses it properly. She states that she had an
episode like this in the past and it was diagnosed as viral
bronchitis. She denies being around anyone else who has been
sick. She states that she has been experiencing more chronic DOE
over the past few months, which describes as different breathing
sounds after doing physical activity. She is able to walk
without sx, but has noticed them when cleaning the kitchen. She
has had a nuclear stress test and PFTs recently which have been
normal.
.
Of note, she has a four-five year history of paroxysmal AFib, on
coumadin and sotalol. She is asymptomatic and cannot tell when
she goes in and out of Afib.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be wheezing loudly and in AFib. Her
VS were T 97.7, HR 110, BP134/94, RR 19, O2 sats 91% RA. She
received prednisone 40 mg, levaquin, and abluterol and atrovent
nebulizers. She states that the atrovent nebulizers really
helped her SOB.

Studies-
cxr [**2110-6-26**]
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained. The
lungs are
clear bilaterally demonstrating no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is
unremarkable. Visualized osseous structures are intact. Mild
scoliosis of
the thoracolumbar spine is stable. No signs of PNA or CHF.
.
EKG earlier demonstrated afib, now EKG is SR, lt axis devation,
rate of 62, nonspecific Twave changes (unchanged from old EKG
TELEMETRY demonstrated: currently SR
Perfussion study: [**5-1**]
IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion. Gated images could not
be obtained secondary to underlying arrhythmia.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**5-1**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion. There is mild to
moderate pulmonic regurgitation
.
ETT performed on demonstrated:  [**5-1**],
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. Marked
shortness of breath noted at peak exercise. Nuclear report sent
separately.

OTHER TESTING:  PFTS - done [**2110-6-18**] - within normal limits


Brief Hospital Course:
Asthma exacerbation - Thought to be secondary to a viral
bronchitis given prodromal URI symptoms. There was no fever,
leukocytosis, or CXR infiltrate to suggest pneumonia, so
antibiotics were withheld. Patient was admitted to the ICU for
monitoring given the severity of her initial presentation of
SOB.  She was treated with prednisone 30 mg to be continued on a
brief taper (30mg x 3 days, 20mg x 3 days, 10mg x 3 days),
scheduled Atrovent nebulizers, and supplemental O2. Nebs
subsequently changed to MDIs. Currently she is asymptomatic with
oxygen saturation in the high 90s RA. Beta-blockage thought not
to be a significant contributor to bronchospasm given the
lengthy duration of treatment, however, it was held for one day,
and then the next day pt was in afib. Pt was given instructions
on how to use inhalers, but would Probably benefits for more out
pt teaching by PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] this dose not help, pt may benifit from
an out pt nebulizer machine for abuterol txs.
.
AFib - Home dose of sotalol 80 mg PO BID was continued. Per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] from cardiology, diltiazem was begun at 30 mg PO QID
for better rate control, but the patient had asymptomatic
hypotension to the 80s systolic so the dose was
