Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
69 yo F w/PMHx sx for PVD, COPD who presents with shortness of
breath over the course of the last several days. Patient states
that she developed a nonproductive cough last week, and saw her
PCP who diagnosed her with bronchitis and treated her with
ciprofloxacin and guaifenesin with codeine, and then with
albuterol inhalers. She states that the symptoms did not
improve, and she developed SOB at rest, with marked worsening
over the last two days, to the point that she has had to sleep
upright in a chair. She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats.
She states that she develops some chest pain with coughing, but
does not have chest pain at rest. She also notes nausea and
vomiting after fits of coughing. She has never had these
episodes before.
.
Patient was initially seen in the ED where her initial VS were
T97.0 BP 123/60 HR 119 RR 28 O2sat 90% RA. She was felt to have
a pneumonia and CHF, and was given azithromycin, nitro paste,
nebulizers, ceftriaxone, furosemide 40 mg IV, aspirin 325,
zofran, and morphine. Her initial EKG showed sinus tachycardia
with 2 mm STE in V3. She had a CTA which showed bilateral
pleural effusions and GGO c/w pulmonary edema, and she developed
worsening respiratory distress and was placed on BiPap, with
good resolution of her symptoms. Her first set of CE were
positive.
.
Per patient report, she had a recent chemical stress test at her
cardiologist's office 3 weeks ago, which was negative.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. She does note exertional calf
pain, as well as the development of a hematoma at the time of
prior bypass surgery. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea
on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea. She denies
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

EKG:
[**2187-4-22**] 16:10: Sinus tachycardia. [**Apartment Address(1) **] mm in V3. [**Apartment Address(1) **] mm V4.
LVH.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**12-12**] demonstrated: EF 45-50%.
Moderate regional left ventricular dysfunction with moderate
hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior segments. Moderate to
severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate aortic regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
[**2187-4-23**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mid to distal anterior, septal and apical
hypokinesis - LAD territory). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The aortic valve is not
well seen. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The aortic regurgitation vena contracta is >0.6cm. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. At least moderate (2+), eccentric mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-12-18**],
regional LV systolic dysfunction is new.
