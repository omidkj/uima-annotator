Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 39008**] is a 72 year-old man
with a history of hypertension who presented to an outside
hospital complaining of chest pain radiating to his jaw and
arms.  He went to his local Emergency Department where they
found that his cardiac enzymes were negative.  His
electrocardiogram showed a right bundle branch block and his
chest pain was typical for angina.  This prompted them to do
a cardiac catheterization.  Findings at the time of
catheterization included 90 to 95% left main disease in
addition to other areas of stenosis.  Therefore, this
prompted an emergent transfer to [**Hospital1 190**] for cardiac revascularization and he was sent
here on both intravenous heparin and nitroglycerin drips.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypertension.  2.  Osteoarthritis.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease with complaints of
claudication.  4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  5.
History of tobacco use.  6.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  He
denies any history of stroke, cancer, thyroid disease or
diabetes.

MEDICATIONS:  1. Atenolol.  2.  Zestril.  3.  HCTZ.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

LABORATORY STUDIES AT THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White blood cell
count 7.9, hematocrit 39.8, platelets are 255, potassium 4.3,
BUN and creatinine are 33 and 1.9.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His neck is notable for a right
carotid bruit.  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart has a regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities are without swelling or
varicosity.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Surgery Service after emergent transfer from [**Hospital6 3873**].  He remained pain free on his heparin and
nitroglycerin drips through the night and the next morning
was taken to the Operating Room.  On [**2102-5-4**] the
patient had coronary artery bypass graft times four.  His
grafts were left internal mammary coronary artery to left
anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal one, saphenous vein graft to diagonal.  The
patient's procedure itself was unremarkable.  His total
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 106 minutes with a cross
clamp time of 86 minutes.  Postoperatively, he was
transported to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit.  At
that time he was atrially paced and had neo-synephrine and
had propofol drips running.  By the following morning he was
extubated, but still required a neo-synephrine drip.  By the
second postoperative day his neo-synephrine was weaned off
and he was stable to be transferred to the floor.  There he
was aggressively diuresed and his physical activity was
encouraged.  His Foley was discontinued on the evening of the
second postoperative day.

By postoperative day number four he developed some serous
sternal drainage.  Gram stain was taken of this that
demonstrated no white blood cells and no bacteria.
Regardless he was started on intravenous Vancomycin for
prophylaxis against worsening infection.  At that time his
sternum was stable to palpation and demonstrated no erythema.
By the following day postoperative day number five the
patient was ambulating adequately well with physical therapy
and no longer had an oxygen requirement.  His wound appeared
stable and he was switched from intravenous Vancomycin to
oral Keflex.  On [**2102-5-4**] the patient was discharged
home in stable condition in the care of his family.  He was
instructed to follow up with his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3613**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5263**] in two weeks.  In addition, he was instructed to
follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in four weeks.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Protonix 40 mg po q day, enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg po q day, Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.,
Lasix 20 mg b.i.d. times seven days, potassium chloride 20
milliequivalents b.i.d. times seven days.  Lopressor 25 mg po
b.i.d., Keflex 500 mg po t.i.d. times seven days.  Percocet
5/325 one to two po q 4 to 6 hours prn.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease and unstable angina with
critical left main disease now status post coronary artery
bypass graft times four.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
