Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Reason for MICU admission: Hypoxia with pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year old woman with history of hyperlipidemia and
smoking who presents with right subscapular pain, pleuritic. She
initially presented to [**Hospital1 487**] Gen and was found to be hypoxic
on RA (80%) w/ CXR revealing RML PNA. A CT w/o contrast was
performed, which was concerning for thoracic aortic aneurism.
She was transferred by [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.
.
En route to [**Hospital1 18**], she became transiently hypotensive to the
80's but responded to a small amount of fluid. On arrival, her
room air sat was 80% and she was put on a nonrebreather. A CT
was performed with contrast despite creatinine of 2.4 which
showed 2 areas of ~6cm aortic aneurism without evidence of
dissection, and right sided pneumonia. Thoracic surgery
evaluated her and felt her clinical presentation was most likely
due to the pneumonia, so she was admitted to the MICU on a
nonrebreather.
.
ROS: She complains of pain under her right rib and right side of
her back for a few months. The pain was worse yesterday and she
had more shortness of breath yesterday. The pain is worse taking
a deep breath, and worse with walking. Currently it's [**5-9**] but
was 15/10 on admission. It radiates to her back and feels like
muscle cramping. She's had a cough for the last 3-4 weeks,
productive of small amounts of white sputum and no blood.
.
She denies orthopnea or PND, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting,
weight loss, dysuria, or other concerns. Chronic dyspnea on
exertion. She can only walk 1 block now, from no limitation a
few years ago.

CT Abdomen [**2156-2-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Two focal aortic aneurysms involving the aortic arch and
lower thoracic aorta. Ectatic descending thoracic aorta also
seen.  Diffuse atherosclerotic disease, mural thrombus and
plaque, and penetrating ulcers seen throughout the aorta,
however, there is no evidence of aortic dissection or aneurysm
leak.

2. Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe consistent with
pneumonia.
Follow-up imaging is recommended following treatment to document
resolution.

3. Enlarged bulky left adrenal gland, prominent right adrenal
gland;
incompletely evaluated on this single- phase study.

4.  Multiple hypoattenuating lesions within the kidneys
bilaterally,
the largest of which likely represent renal cysts, the smallest
of which are
incompletely characterized.

5.  Possible narrowing of the left renal artery distal to its
origin.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 year-old female with aortic aneurysm, right-sided pneumonia,
renal-failure.
.
#) Right-sided pneumonia with hypoxia - The patient was admitted
for right back pain which is possibly due to the pneumonia. CT
and CXR show multilobar infiltrate, and WBC markely elevated
with left shift. No history of nosocomial contact so likely
community aquired.  Started on Ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Sputum cultures sent.
.
#) Ascending and descending aortic aneurism - New diagnosis of
aortic aneurysm with ulceration and atherosclerosis but no
evidence of dissection at this time. Carotid ultrasound with
60-69% stenosis.  Vascular surgery consulted.  Patient had
stable hematocrit and was hemodynamically stable in the ICU and
was transferred to the floor.  However, after a brief stay on
the floor, patient experienced acute decompensation and coded.
It was thought that she experienced rupture of aortic aneurysm.
.
#) hypotension - Was noted to be hypotensive en route to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED, but responded to fluid bolus.  Typed and crossed 4 units.
Patient did not require any transfusion during her stay until
the acute decompensation.  She did not require any pressors.
.
#) Renal failure - unclear baseline creatinine but chronic renal
failure urine output stable. No evidence of hydronephrosis or
renal artery stenosis on ultrasound, although questionable
stenosis on CTA abdomen. Elevated phos and potassium suggest
this may be subacute. Left renal artery may have focal narrowing
on CT read. Patient also got IV contrast.  No acute issues
during this hospitalization.
.
#) Enlarged uterus - Patient found to incidentally have large
heterogenous uterus on abdominal CT. Will need further
characterization with transvaginal ultrasound.
.
#) Chest pain - 1 set cardiac enzymes negative. No history of
CAD. EKG OK. No evidence of ACS as pneumonia vs aneurism more
likely explain pain.
.
#) elevated [**Name (NI) 53324**] - unclear etiology. Will monitor and hold
statin if further elevated
.
#) hyperlipidemia - hold statin
.
#) hypothyroid - continue synthroid
.
#) depression - zoloft, zyprexa
.
#) FEN - cardiac, renal diet
.
#) access - large bore PIV's
.
#) code status - full, discussed with patient
.
#) communication - with patient, HCP Daughter [**Name (NI) 6480**]
