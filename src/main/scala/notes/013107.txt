History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 69 male with CAD s/p CABG in [**2166**], [**Year (4 digits) 1291**] in [**2151**], s/p biV
pacer/AICD in [**2168**], who presented to [**Hospital1 **] ED on [**2170-5-15**]
with c/o SOB 1 day, wkness, fever to 104. Found to have MSSA
endocarditis after blood cx's grew MSSA. Subsequently became
septic and developed cardiogenic shock requiring intubation on
[**2170-5-16**]. Started on DOPA/neo/vasopressin. TTE 0.5 inner
vegetation posterior AV ring w/o vavular leak. Dx prosthetic
valve endocarditis and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2170-5-21**]. On [**5-22**]
he had a cardiac cath which revealed patent grafts to LAD and
OM, with occluded graft to PDA.; not medicated for the contrast,
Cr rose to 1.6 on [**5-23**] from baseline of 1.1 thought to be
contrast related. At that time, Abx consisted of
oxacillin/gent/rifampin. TEE on [**5-23**] revealed probable aortic
root abcess with suspected small pacer wire vegetation. Also had
sputum growth positive for Serratia Proteus on [**5-23**] sensitive to
Levo, thought to be ventilator associated pneumonia. Renal US
sone on [**5-25**] showed no hydronephrosis. Gentamycin was D/c'd on
[**5-26**], after Cr continued to rise. Had stool cultures positive
for C.Diff on [**5-27**] and was placed on Flagyl. TTE on [**5-29**]
revealed an anterior echo dense space (2.5 x 1.5 cm), with 1+
mitral regurgitation, and a nonruptured, posterior sinus of
Valsalva aneurysm (3.5 x 1.5 cm) which is being closely
monitored. Renal was consulted on [**2170-5-31**], at which time the Cr
had risen to 3.1. Patient is now being transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
APG for medical management.

69 yo M with multiple medical problems including an [**Name (NI) 1291**] in [**2151**]
w/ mechanical valve, s/p biV pacer/AICD in [**2168**], CAD s/p CABG in
[**2166**], who presented to [**Hospital1 **] ED on [**2170-5-15**] with c/o SOB 1
day, weakness, and fever to 104. Blood cxs grew MSSA leading to
suspicion for MSSA endocarditis. The pt subsequently became
septic and developed cardiogenic shock requiring intubation on
[**2170-5-16**]. He was started on Dopamine/neosynephrine/vasopressin.
TTE demonstrated 0.5cm inner vegetation on the posterior AV ring
w/o vavular leak. The pt was diagnosed with prosthetic valve
endocarditis and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2170-5-21**] for further
management.
.
    On [**5-22**] the pt had a cardiac cath which revealed patent
grafts to LAD and OM, with occluded graft to PDA.  The pt was
not medicated for the contrast and his Cr rose to 1.6 the
following AM ([**5-23**]) from baseline of 1.1. At that time, Abx
consisted of nafcillin/gent/rifampin. TEE on [**5-23**] revealed ?
aortic root abcess with suspected small pacer wire vegetation.
Also had sputum growth positive for Serratia Proteus on [**5-23**]
sensitive to Levo, thought to be ventilator associated
pneumonia. Renal US done on [**5-25**] showed no hydronephrosis.
Gentamycin was D/c'd on [**5-26**], after Cr continued to rise. Had
stool cultures positive for C.Diff on [**5-27**] and was started on
Flagyl. TTE on [**5-29**] revealed an anterior echo dense space (2.5 x
1.5 cm), with 1+ mitral regurgitation, and a nonruptured,
posterior sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (3.5 x 1.5 cm) which is
being closely monitored.
.
Renal was consulted on [**2170-5-31**], at which time the Cr had risen to
3.1.
.
On the evening of [**5-13**] patient developed hypotension and
received IVF. On the AM of [**2170-6-5**], the patient developed
respiratory distress, thought to be [**2-1**] to fluid overload. Noted
to have wheezing (+smoking hx but no dx of COPD and no prior tx
with nebs) and clinically was very volume overloaded. Patient
received nebs without relief; CXR and physical exam consistent
with CHF. He received Lasix 40mg IV x2 and 80mg IV x1. Patient
had a repeat TTE to assess for increasing valavular dysfunction
which found the mechanical aortic valve leaflets more echogenic,
with increased acoustic shadowing, possibly indicating the
presence of vegetation or thrombus. Correlation with TEE was
recommended.
.
Upon arrival to CCU, patient denied chest pain, was feling short
of breath. No N/V, abd pain, or other localizing complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital6 **] on [**2170-5-21**]
with acute endocarditis of his aortic valve (MSSA).  He had a
prolonged pre-operative course on the cardiology medicine
service complicated by:
removal of infected AICD & leads
ventilator associated pneumonia
post-cath ATN, requiring temporary dialysis
C.Diff colitis
sacral decubitus
He was taken to the OR on [**2170-7-10**] for a 2nd time re-do
sternotomy, and mediastinal dissection.  Since this was quite
extensive, he was taken back to the CSRU overnight.  The
following day, he was taken back to the OR on [**2170-7-11**], where he
underwent replacement of asc. aorta (26 Gelweave graft), re-do
mecahnical [**Date Range 1291**] (25 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]), MV repair, LVOT repair, repair of
proximal OM vein graft.
Post-op, he wsa taken to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on
vasopressin, epinephrine, levophed, milrinone, and amiodarone,
with an IABP in place.  His vasoactive drips were weaned, and
his IABP was removed on POD # 3.  Over the next few days, he was
weaned from mechanical ventilation, and extubated on POD # 5.
Speech therapy evaluated Mr. [**Known lastname 67363**], and felt it was safe to
feed him, but due to poor apetite, and low PO intake, a feeding
tube remained in place and continues to be used for nutrition.
Anticoagulation  was initiated with heparin, but he was found to
be HIT positive.  Heparin was discontinued, Argatroban and
Coumadin were started.  Argatroban was discontinued when the INR
was theraeutic.
He had a pleural effusion drained on [**2170-7-20**], and remianed
hemodynamically stable. His NPH insulin was started post-op, but
then discontinued due to hypoglycemia.  He was continued on
Glyburide, with sliding scale regular insulin coverage as
needed. He was followed closely by the infectious disease
service, who recommended that he discontinue the PO vancomycin,
and continue IV Vanco & Rifampin until [**2170-9-5**].
The EP service followed his as well, and felt that he should be
on continuous cardia
