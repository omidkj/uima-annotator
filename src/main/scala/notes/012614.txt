Allergies:
Amiodarone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension s/p EP procedure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD device lead and generator change
dobutamine

History of Present Illness:
77 yo Russian only speaking male with hx of ischemic CM (EF
25%)s/pCABG and PCI with last in [**7-21**], aflutter and VT s/p
ablations and AICD and biV pacer placement being transfered to
CCU for hypotension after initial admission for wire and
generator change. The patient presented to device clinic on
[**2200-6-13**] after hisdevice fired. According to the nurse from
device clinic,interrogation showed "noise on the lead consistent
with insulation break". VF detection parameters were extended.
He was referred for lead replacement and probable generator
change. While undergoing removal of an SVC coil and placement of
a new RA lead he developed diaphoresis and hypotension. Pt
denied CP/SOB at time of incident. Initially this was thought to
be due to vagal response but did not resolve so he was given 1L
IVF and started on dopamine @5mcg/hr. Stat TTE was performed and
revealed no sign of blood or fluid in the pericardium. He cont
to complain of mild diziness and SBP remained in the low 90's so
he was transferred to the CCU for further management.

Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction
   in [**2185**] and coronary artery bypass graft in [**2185**]
   (saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal to ramus, left
   internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, and
   saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery;
   saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal stented in
   [**2198-12-17**], saphenous vein graft to right coronary
   artery known occluded).
2. Ischemic cardiomyopathy (with a severely depressed
   ejection fraction).
3. Ventricular tachycardia; status post ablation and
   automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and
   pacemaker placement.
4. Atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin).
5. Hyperlipidemia
6. Hypothyroidism (secondary to amiodarone toxicity).
7. Chronic renal insufficiency.
8. Amiodarone lung toxicity.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo male with ischemic chf (ef<25%), aflutter s/p ablation,
sss s/p PM; s/p ICD; VT ablation; CRI, amio toxicity, and
thyroid toxicity who presented for ICD generatory change and
lead revision [**6-19**] transferred to the ccu for persistent
hypotension post -procedure.
..
1. Hypotension - On transfer to unit, SBP in 90's despite
dopamine (baseline appears to be SBP 110-130) and had been as
low as 60s immediately after procedure. Given initial concern
for blood loss, his anticoagulation was reversed with vitamin K
and FFPx1 unit. Initially ddx included: blood loss [**2-19**] procedure
(ie SVC injury although unlikely as TTE already done without
evidence of pericardial effusion and hct stable throughout
admission) vs vagal response vs medication effect (narcotics) vs
ischemic event causing cardiac compromise - unlikely as
troponins only very mildly elevated (peaked at 0.07) and CKs
remain flat. Hypotension thought to likely be caused by side
effect of medications given during procedure.  In the CCU, the
dopamine was weaned and his BP returned to [**Location 213**] levels. We
added back the Toprol XL at a lower dose (50 mg QD, home dose
was 125 mg QD). We also held imdur and cozaar. Upon discharge we
restarted the cozaar at 25 mg (home dose was 50 mg QD). THese
will need to be titrated up as an outpatient.
2. Rhythm - His leads were felt to be in stable position and
sensing well. He was in NSR. We continued outpatient dofetilide
3. CAD - continued outpatient dose of asa, statin. We held
bblocker given hypotension. We restarted the Toprol xl at a
lower dose (50 mg QD). He should have this titrated back up as
an outpatient. We restarted cozaar upon discharge.
4. Hematuria: Felt to be related to foley trauma. The urine
cleared over 24 hours.
