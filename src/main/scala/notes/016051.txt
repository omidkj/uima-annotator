Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**]
Chief Complaint:
abnormal labs

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC Line placement

History of Present Illness:
67 y.o. Female with h.o. Crohns disease (on Prednisone,
previously on Mtx which has been d/c'd), recently completed
course of Cipro/Flagyl for ostomy infection, multiple abdominal
surgeries (last [**6-6**]) for ostomy revision referred to ED for
abnormal lab values.

She was discharged [**9-17**] after a surgical admission for fistula
at ostomy site, infection at site (D/C'd on cipro/flagyl), high
ostomy output and electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia and
HCO3 11). She was treated with IVFs, electroloyte repletion,
antibiotics as above, and loperamide. On discharge she stated
that she had some nausea that she attributed to the antibiotics.
She denies vomiting and ostomy output has remained constant. She
received a methotrexate treatment on [**10-8**] and states that her
nausea and fatigue worsened. No CP. Chronic dyspnea on exertion.
She drinks [**5-3**] 10oz glasses of water daily, taking in very
little solids. Lost [**8-5**] lbs in last few weeks.

Pt went to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**] yesterday for follow up. She was
started on Coumadin for a DVT seen on CT scan [**9-13**]. At that time
she had labs drawn which were abnormal, specifically Na 127,
HCO3 8, Creatinine of 1.4. pt was called and instructed to come
into the ED.

In the ED initial vs were: T97.6, P100, BP 125/68, R 20, O2 sat
99%. She was noted to have abdominal pain (/which is chronic for
her) and was given Zofran 4,g x 1, Oxycodone 10mg x 1 and
empirically started on IV Ciprofloxacin/Flagyl. A CT
abdomen/pelvis was obtained which showed no bowel obstruction or
abscess, but was notable for filling defects of b/l common
femoral veins, new on the L and worse on right. New right
internal iliac vein. In the ED she also became transiently
hypotensive to low 80s, was asymptomatic. At that time she had
an EJ placed in addition to PIV and was given stress dose
steroids with Dexamethasone 10mg IV x 1, started on 2L of NS.
She was also started on Heparin gtt for her DVTs.

Of note she was recently discharged on [**9-17**] from surgical
service for infection of her ostomy site. At that time, per D/C
summary, she was noted to have high ostomy output; stool studies
were negative and she was given IVF and Imodium. She was
discharged with 1 month of Cipro/Flagyl.

Imaging:
Echo [**10-28**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior and
inferoseptal hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Low normal left ventricular systolic function.
Mildly dilated right ventricle with mild global hypokinesis.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

EKG [**10-25**]:
Atrial fibrillation with uncontrolled ventricular response.
Right bundle branch block. Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2144-10-21**] right
bundle-branch block can be seen on the current tracing. The
rhythm is now atrial fibrillation. The overall rate is
increased.

CT Ab/Pelvis [**10-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral common femoral vein DVT with right sided extension
to the deep pelvic veins.

2. Post-surgical changes in the a
