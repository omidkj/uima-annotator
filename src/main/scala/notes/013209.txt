Morphine / Demerol / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Benign obstruction of the ampulla of vater

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory celiotomy
Extended adhesiolysis
Introperative ultrasound
Open cholecystectomy
Transduodenal ampullary sphincteroplasty
Placement of jejunostomy feeding tube


History of Present Illness:
62 yo female with a long history of pancreaticobiliary problems
including an episode of acute pancreatitis this year.  Her
pancreatitis is attributed to a benign stricture of the ampulla
of vater identified by MRCP.  Her course has been complicated by
nutritional marasmus requiring preoperative TPN for several
months.

Past Medical History:
Peptic ulcer disease s/p Billroth II 20 years ago.
Nutritional marasmus requiring tpn.
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy fo the right upper extremity
Emphysema

Social History:
none

Family History:
none

Physical Exam:
Neuro:  awake, alert, in no apparent distress
General:  cachectic
HEENT: sunken temples
Chest:  clear breath sounds; breathing easily at rest on nasal
cannula
Cor:  RRR with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
Abd:  Open subcostal incision with fibrinous exudate at the
base. Moderate
      amount of healthy appearing granulation tissue.
Ext:  warm.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following an uncomplicated transduodenal sphincteroplasty, the
patient was admitted to the surgical inpatient floor.  The
patient's immediate postoperative progress was hampered by
difficulty achieving adequate analgesia despite consultation
with the Acute Pain Service. This led to poor pulmonary toilet.


On POD #2 she had a temperature elevation to 102.3 as well as
decreased oxygen saturation to 88%.  Additionally, a CXR showed
evidence of pulmonary edema, basilar atelectasis, and possible
pneumonia.

The patient was therefore transferred to the ICU for intensive
pulmonary support including chest physiotherapy, high flow
oxygen, and empiric iv antibiotics.  At her worst she had an A-a
gradient of >500 and required oxygen by non-rebreather mask to
acheive a oxygen saturation in the low 90's.  The patient never
required intubation.

Pulmonary medicine consultation was obtained.  Diagnostic
evaluation of her respiratory problems included CT angiogram to
rule out pulmonary embolism and cardiac ultrasound to r/o
noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Both were negative however,
changes consistent with emphysema (previously undiagnosed), were
found on the chest ct.

Over the following week, the patient had a slow recovery of her
pulmonary function through judicious diuresis and aggressive
pulmonary toilet. By POD #9, she was back to nasal cannula at
2lpm without respiratory distress, saturating in the mid to
upper 90's.

On POD #5, a wound infection was discovered that involved the
entire skin incision.  There was no involvement of the subjacent
fascia.  This was treated with twice daily wet to dry dressing
changes through the remainder of the hospital course.  Cultures
of the wound yielded sparse E.Coli, sensitive to multiple
agents, and coag neg. staph.  She was treated with appropriate
antibiotics.

By POD #11, Ms. [**Known lastname 51471**] displays a marked improvement overall
though she still has a small oxygen requirement.  Her pain is
well controlled, her wound is improving, and she is tolerating a
regular diet supplemented by full strenght tube feeds through
her jejunal tube.  She will be transferred to a rehab facility
for an anticipated 1 week for additional help with pulmonary
toilet, wound care, and physical therapy.
