Brief Hospital Course:
Altered mental status:   Patient initially admitted to ICU for
close monitoring before being transferred to the inpatient floor
the following day.  Initially it was thought the patient may
have a worsening pneumonia.  Patient was noted to be aspirating
with copious secretions.  The patient failed speech and swallow
evaluation.  Work up for altered mental status was done,
including cultures, head CT, metabolic problems was all
neagtive.  In the end the altered mental status was believed to
be a result of severe deconditioning from multiple acute medical
problems on top of his multiple myeloma/MDS.  There was not much
else that we could do for the patient.  The family did not want
to put the patient through any uncomfortable procedures such as
an LP.  They did not want a feeding tube placed.  The patient
was not a candidate for any treatment for his myeloma.
Palliative care consult was obtained and after careful
discussion the family made the decision to make the patient CMO.
 All nonessential meds were stopped and the patient expired
peacefully on [**2109-10-31**].
