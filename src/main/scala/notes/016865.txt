CTA Chest
1. Severe emphysema with superimposed severe pulmonary edema.
Large
dependent bilateral consolidations, likely reflect fluid-filled
alveolar
spaces, though aspiration and infection cannot be excluded.
2. Enlarged pulmonary arteries, compatible with pulmonary
arterial
hypertension, and right ventricular enlargement. No pulmonary
embolus.
3. Acute bilateral anterior rib and sternal fractures, secondary
to chest
compressions.
4. Orogastric tube terminating at the gastroesophageal junction
and should be
advanced. Positioning of the orogastric tube was communicated by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17321**] via telephone at 10PM [**2183-1-20**].
5. Perihepatic ascites.

CT head no contrast
IMPRESSION: Global loss of grey white differentiation,
concerning for global
hypoxia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after cardiac arrest for cooling
protocol. Sent to MICU on two pressors and intubated/ventilated.

In the MICU:

Several minutes after the patient arrived to the floor, he had a
pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest.  A code blue was
immediately called. Chest compressions were initiated. He was
already intubated and ventilated. He received several doses of
epinephrine, vasopressin, ampules of bicarbonate, insulin,
dextrose, calcium chloride, and atropine.  Several vasopressor
drips were started, including vasopressin, norepinephrine,
epinephrine, dopamine, and neosynephrine.  A bicarbonate drip
was started. A bedside echocardiogram by ICU attending Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] showed global hypokinesis but no cardiac tamponade. TPA
was contemplated but not given as he had a negative CTA prior to
arriving to the floor and he likely had pulmonary hemorrhage as
a result of chest compressions given throughout the day. The
patient regained a pulse thirty minutes after initiation of
ACLS. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] spoke to the family and the patient code status
was subsequently determined to be DNR. The family did get an
opportunity to see the patient even during the code blue.
Following continued discussions, with lack of improvement, focus
of care was transitioned to comfort.  The patient expired at
1:33AM on [**2184-1-21**].
