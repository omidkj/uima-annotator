Chief Complaint:
s/p Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Chest tube thoracostomy


History of Present Illness:
67 year old
male transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for further care following a
mechanical fall while walking down a flight of stairs while
using
crutches last evening.  He slipped down about 5 steps and fell
forward and his head broke through the drywall and he landed on
his left side.  There was no LOC and the fall was witnessed by
his family.  He endorses alcohol consumption that evening and
was
using crutches due to the pain and unsteadiness resulting from a
recently diagnoses [**Hospital Ward Name **] cyst.  He initially denied any chest
pain, shortness of breath, headache, neck pain or any other
musculoskeletal pains; however, while in the ER he had described
some discomfort in the left posterolateral chest.  The pain
scale
has been [**6-20**], worse with movements which also led to mild
shortness of breath.  He was given IV morphine for pain control
and underwent a Chest CT which showed left sided [**1-17**] rib
fractures as well as a moderately sized left pneumothorax.
Additionally he had a 1cm scalp laceration on the left side of
the head that was closed with 3 surgical staples in the ED.
Patient was admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring and was
noted to have oxygen desaturation.  This morning he underwent
bronchoscopy with removal of mucus from the airway and placement
of a left sided chest tube which successfully evacuated the
pneumothorax.  His respiratory status improved be he continues
to
require a non-rebreather face mask at 15L 02.  An epidural was
attempted to be place at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] but without good effect.
He
was kept on a morphine PCA and continues to report discomfort
with deep inspiration or coughing.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery team for management of
his rib fractures and pneumothorax. He was given intravenous
narcotics initially for pain control and was later changed to
oral pain medications as his pain improved. Serial chest xrays
were followed and the chest tube was pulled on HD #3. The post
pull chest xray revealed a small apical pneumothorax along with
some atelectasis and small effusion. Clinically he required [**1-14**]
liters nasal oxygen which was gradually weaned off; he was also
given nebulizers and incentive spirometer which improved his
overall respiratory status. On day of [**Month/Day (3) **] the xray showed
that the previously seen pneumothorax was stable.

At time of [**Month/Day (3) **] he is also tolerating a regular diet and
ambulating independently. His home medications were restarted
and his pain is well controlled with oral narcotics. He is also
continuing on a course of Levaquin for 2 weeks for his
pneumonia.

He will follow up with Acute Care Surgery team in a few weeks
and also with his primary care doctor for a general physical.
