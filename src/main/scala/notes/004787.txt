Brief Hospital Course:
Attending on this case was Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
.
Patient admitted to the CCU for management of anterolateral MI
s/p bare metal stent to LAD.
.
#Cardiac: On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was brought to cath lab
where a bare metal stent was placed in proximal LAD (as per
above).  On arrival in CCU, patient was with stable vital signs,
but with mild 1/10 chest pain.  EKG demonstrated persistent ST
elevations in the precordial leads with some decrease in
magnitude of the elevation from prior EKG's, and with q-waves as
well.  Patient received morphine PRN with resolution of his
pain.  Cardiac enzymes peaked at CK 5073.  Repeat Echo the
following morning demonstrated an apical LV aneurysm and patient
was started on coumadin for prevention of thromboembolic
disease.
.
By echo, LV function was severely depressed with normal LV wall
thickness.  Top normal/borderline dilated LV cavity size.
Apical LV aneurysm. Moderate-severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. No LV mass/thrombus. TDI E/e' >15,
suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient.  Estimated EF
25-30% (see report for full details).
.
Patient was monitored in the CCU for 24-36 hours w/o event.  He
was then transferred to the floor where he received smoking
cessation counseling, and physical therapy evaluation.  He was
discharged with outpatient follow-up for general cardiology, and
EP for possible AICD placement.  Discharge medications included
ASA, plavix, coumadin, lovenox bridging, atorvastatin,
lisinopril, metoprolol, and eplerenone.
.
#Depression: Patient was restarted on citalopram on hospital day
1.  He reported no active SI/HI.
.
Remainder of the hospital course was uncomplicated.
