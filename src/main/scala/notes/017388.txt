Chief Complaint:
PCP: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

CC:[**Hospital6 88030**]
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
percutaneous intraabdominal drain for biloma
percutaneous cholecystostomy
central venous line placement x2
axillary arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 22159**] is a 69 M with a medical history notable for
previous partial gastrectomy and peripheral vascular disease
transferred from [**Hospital6 302**] with an intra-abdominal
fluid collection concerning for a biloma.

In reviewing Mr. [**Known lastname 88031**] large chart from the OSH, there are a
few conflicting pieces of information. Below is what was
collected from interview with the patient and on review of the
OSH records.

He originally presented to [**Hospital6 302**] the first week of
[**Month (only) 359**] with abdominal pain and vomitting. He reported
intermittent epigastric pain not associated with food or BM,
typically a [**5-23**]. He had no similar abdominal pain in the past.
His evaluation at that time reportedly revealed the following: a
HIDA scan with delayed gall bladder emptying but no definite
obstruction, an abdominal MRI with a mildly distended gall
bladder with no evidence of stone, an elevated lipase, and a CT
scan with evidence of acute pancreatitis. He was diagnosed with
acalculous cholecystitis and discharged on 2 weeks of Augmentin.


He reports feeling well after discharge but noted recurrent
abdominal pain and loose, watery bowel movements. He was
re-admitted to [**Hospital6 302**] on [**2112-11-1**] for these
symptoms. His evaluation revleaed an albumin of 1.5, negative C
diff toxin, a TTE with LVEF 60-65% and normal RV function, a PE
CT that revealed a left lower lobe PE (diagnosed on the day of
transfer), and a CT abdomen that revealed a large, loculated
fluid collection behind the liver with persistent gall bladder
dilation and a stricture of the common hepatic duct. For the
above CT findings, he had an ERCP on [**11-3**] that revealed
contrast accumulation adjacent to the gall bladder consistent
with a bile leak; a stent was placed in the common hepatic duct
though there was no obvious obstruction there. A repeat CT scan
on [**11-5**] revealed interval improvement in the fluid collection
and incidental findings of a left lower lobe air bronchogram
(started on Zosyn for presumed pneumonia) and left kidney
perfusion defects concerning for infarct.

Medications on transfer:
 - Atenolol 25mg daily
 - Lactobacillus
 - Protonix 40mg IV twice daily
 - Zosyn 3.375g IV q6 hours
 - Crestor 5mg daily
 - Flomax 0.4mg daily
 - Aspirin 81mg and Plavix 75mg daily (on hold since [**11-3**])
 - Morphine for pain
 - Zofran for nausea
 - Oxazepam 10mg qhs
 - Percocet as needed for pain

Review of Systems: Prior to the above Mr. [**Known lastname 22159**] tells me he
felt well and was independent at home. Over the last month he
noted no fevers, chills, or night sweats. Appetite is poor and
his weight is down. No SOB, cough, or chest pain. No urinary
symptoms. Other systems reviewed in detail and all otherwise
negative.

Past Medical History:
 - Either gastric or esophageal cancer s/p resection with
parital gastrectomy, chemotherapy and radiation (approximately 5
years ago).
 - Hypertension
 - Coronary artery disease and patient reports no MI or
revasculariztion procedures
 - Peripheral vascular disease s/p revascularization procedure
[**8-/2112**]


Social History:
He is independent and lives with his girlfriend. [**Name (NI) **] smokes [**1-16**]
ppd and drinks occasional alcohol.

Family History:
He believes his sister had her gall bladder removed but he is
unsure. No other history of gall bladder disease or malignancy.

- CV: PMI normal size and not displaced. Regular rhythm. Normal
S1, S2. He has a harsh, systolic murmur at the base that is
somewhat high-pitched. No radiation. JVP 6 cm.
- Abdomen: Normal bowel sounds. His abdomen is firm. No
tenderness with deep palpation of all quadrants.
- Extremities: diffuse LE edema, [**2-17**]+; also with swelling and
weeping of UE
- Neuro: Alert, oriented x3. Good fund of knowledge about
medical care over the last month. Able to discuss current events
and memory is intact. CN 2-12 intact. English is his second

CT head: [**2112-11-14**]
Right MCA and ACA territory infarction with significant mass
effect resulting in leftward subfalcine herniation, right uncal
herniation and concern for impending cerebellar tonsillar
herniation. Entrapment of the left lateral ventricle. Diffuse
sulcal effacement. Emergent neurosurgery consult recommended.

CT torso: [**2112-11-10**]
1. Progressive worsening multifocal consolidations involving the
right upper, middle and lower lobes concerning for pneumonia. In
the setting of the contrast within the esophagus and layering on
the cords, concern for
aspiration pneumonia is high.
2. Pulmonary embolism of the left posterior basal segmental
artery.
3. Interval worsening of the lobulated effusion on the right
with layering
over the major fissure. The appearance of this effusion is
concerning for
exudative process.
4. Interval drainage of the perihepatic fluid collection.
Persistent
gallbladder distention, gallbladder wall edema, but
decompression of
intrahepatic bile ducts with stent post ERCP. Heterogeneous
enhancement of the liver concerning for cholangitis. Small
amount of residual perihepatic fluid tracking inferior to the
gallbladder and in periportal spaces. Further attenuation of
left portal vein riases question of thrombosis.
5. Increase in the degree of ascites within the abdomen without
evidence of peritoneal enhancement or thickening to suggest
diffuse
infection/inflammation. Intermesenteric fluid pocket in the
right mid-to-lower abdomen has slight peritoneal thickening and
may be a developing collection.
6. Chronic ischemia to bilateral upper poles of the kidneys,
from radiation.
7. Bilateral superficial femoral artery occlusions stable since
the outside hospital studies.
