PT: 16.3  PTT: 30.0  INR: 1.4

[**7-29**] CT ABD (wet read from OSH):  Dilated loops of small bowel,
measuring up to 5 cm, with transition in distal ileum. Distal
and
terminal ileum are collapsed, compatible with SBO. No free air

Pertinent Results:
[**7-29**] CT abd/pelvis: Dilated loops of small bowel, measuring up to
5 cm, with transition in distal ileum. Distal and terminal ileum
are collapsed, compatible with SBO. No free air or pneumatosis.
Moderate sized pleural effusions bilaterally. Small free fluid
throughout abdomen.
[**7-30**] Echo - Small LV with EF 40%. 4+ tricuspid regurgitation. No
effusion.
[**7-30**] CXR - Moderate B/L pleural effusions with adjacent bibasilar
atelectases have increased on the left. There is new mild
vascular congestion.
[**7-31**] CXR - Interval increase in mediastinal vascular caliber -
probably pulmonary edema. Progressive RML consolidation.
[**8-1**] CXR - bibasilar effusions and consolidation, unchanged
pulmonary
edema.
[**8-2**] CXR - The endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, left-sided
central venous catheter, and feeding tube are all unchanged in
position. There is increase in the bronchovascular markings
compatible with some fluid overload. There are more confluent
areas of consolidation within the bases, which may represent
fluid overload versus aspiration. Left retrocardiac opacity is
seen. There is increase in the left-sided pleural effusion since
the previous study.
[**8-3**] Echo - Left ventricular cavity is unusually small, LVEF
50-55%. Right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen.
[**8-3**] CXR - Multifocal pneumonia most notable in left upper and
right lower lung. Decreased pulmonary edema.
[**8-4**] CXR - Bibasilar opacifications are again consistent with
atelectasis and effusion. There is increasing indistinctness of
pulmonary vessels, consistent with pulmonary edema.
[**8-5**] CXR - No evidence of pneumothorax. Resolving left upper and
right lower lobe consolidation. Unchanged left lower lobe
atelectasis and subsegmental right lower lobe atelectasis.
[**8-5**] ECHO - Improving LV/RV function, EF 50%
9/15 CXR - OGT advanced
[**8-6**] CXR - slight increase in pre-existing opacities at the
right lung base, including a basolateral rounded area of
consolidation. No new opacities.
[**8-7**] CXR - Essentially stable, continued fluid overload
[**8-8**] CXR - There is mild cardiomegaly. Bibasilar opacities left
greater than right are unchanged, could be atelectasis but
superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are stable. Pulmonary edema has
markedly improved, now mild.
[**8-9**] CXR - Unchanged
[**8-9**] RUQ U/S - No definite fluid collection. Trace ascites,
small right pleural effusion.
[**8-10**] CXR - atelectasis vs. pneumonia radiographically
indeterminate
[**8-11**] CXR - increased opacity in the left perihilar and lower
lung that might be consistent with unilateral pulmonary edema
versus
aspiration
[**8-12**] CXR - stable LLL collapse, increased R effusion
[**8-13**] CXR - decreased R effusion
[**8-14**] CXR - This could reflect increasing aspiration or worsening
diffuse pulmonary edema.
[**8-19**] CXR - interval improvement in pulm edema, but still present
bibasilar consolidations and bilateral eff substantial.
[**8-20**] CXR - mild improvement in pulmonary edema, stable b/l
effusions
[**8-24**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis/aneurysm of the basal half of the inferior wall. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45 %). No
intraventricular thrombus is seen. The right ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-8-5**], the
right ventricular cavity is smaller with slightly improved
systolic function. The severity of mitral regurgitation is
increased.
[**8-24**] CXR: minimal increase in R pleural effusion, L pleural
effusion unchanged.
[**8-24**] CT face: Subcutaneous edema, fat stranding, and fascial
thickening extending from the left lateral orbit to the left
mandible without evidence of drainable fluid collection. Soft
tissue opacification of the sphenoid sinus, mastoid air cells
and the
external auditory canal bilaterally.
[**8-24**]: Echo indicates slight improvement in RV function (with
slight worsening of MR).
[**8-25**] CXR: Continued bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectatic change.
[**8-26**] CXR: Little overall change in the appearance of the heart
and lungs except for some increase in the retrocardiac
opacification
[**8-27**] CXR: Persistent
