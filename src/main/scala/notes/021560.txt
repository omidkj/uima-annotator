HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old
woman who was referred to [**Hospital1 188**] for semi elective cardiac catheterization.  The
patient began experiencing chest pain, waking her from sleep,
associated with bilateral upper extremity and neck pain on
[**2153-1-10**].  Each of these intermittent episodes were
relieved with one to two tablets of sublingual nitroglycerin.
The patient also noted increasing dyspnea on exertion over
the two weeks prior to admission.

On the morning of admission, the patient underwent cardiac
catheterization.  This study demonstrated a lesion of the
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal three graft that was
treated with Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
and stenting.  Subsequent to this intervention, the patient
developed hypotension (SBP 60 to 80) and likely sustained
shower emboli distal to the site of the itnervention.  The
patient also demonstrated evidence of diastolic dysfunction
on echo, consistent with myocardial ischemia secondary to the
shower emboli.  She was started on Neo-Synephrine and
Dopamine but remained hypotensive with a SBP of 60 to 80 and
a heart rate in the 120's.  The Dopamine was presumably
contributing to the patient's tachycardia and diastolic
dysfunction (by decreasing cardiac filling time), so it was
stopped. Nor-Epinephrine was also stopped and Neo-Synephrine
was titrated up with an increase in blood pressure to the
120's to 160's systolic.  Also, in the context of the above,
the patient sustained a decrease in her hemoglobin from 12 to
9 and was noted to have "brown" emesis without clear evidence
of hematemesis or coffee ground emesis.  She was given four
liters of intravenous fluid and two nits of packed red blood
cells with an increase in her systolic blood pressure as
noted above.  She was then transferred to the CCU for further
monitoring.  Of note, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed
while the patient was still in the catheterization
laboratory.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.) Coronary artery bypass graft in
[**2138**]; left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending; saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal three;
saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery; status post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting,
[**2149-10-16**] to proximal saphenous vein graft to right coronary
artery and to the small left anterior descending after left
internal mammary artery touch down.

Echocardiogram on [**2153-1-19**] demonstrated Ejection fraction of
60%, mild mitral regurgitation, diastolic dysfunction, and
left atrial enlargement.

q. day.  Diltiazem XL 180 mg p.o. q. day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with her husband
and special needs daughter.  One of her other nine children
is a CCU nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital6 1708**].  The patient
has no history of tobacco abuse.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  In addition to the above, the patient
noted orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations
and light headedness in the days to weeks prior to admission.
She denied any peripheral edema.

On initial physical examination, the patient's heart rate was
64 to 72; blood pressure was 91 to 128 over 22 to 40.
Respiratory rate was 18.  Oxygen saturation was 100% on room
air.  She weighed 80.7 kilograms.  She was on a
Neo-synephrine drip.  In general, she was lying flat on her
back, covered with blankets, in no acute distress and obese.
Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Her mucous membranes were very dry.  Her neck
was soft and supple. there was no lymphadenopathy but this
was difficult to assess secondary to abundant soft tissue.
Her heart was irregular rate and rhythm. There were normal S1
and S2 heart sounds and there was a 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur at bilateral upper sternal borders without rubs or
rales.  The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally in
the mid axillary lines.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended and there were normoactive bowel sounds.  She
had no peripheral edema and there were 2+ dorsalis pedis
pulses bilaterally.

On initial laboratory evaluation, the patient's white count
was 13.1; hematocrit of 26.5; platelets of 374.  Following
blood transfusion, these values increased to 22.3; 32.6 and
290 respectively.  Her initial PT was 16; PTT 34.8 and INR of
1.7.  Serum potassium was 4.4.  Initial CPK was 548 and CK-MB
was 77.  Her pre catheterization electrocardiogram
demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 55 beats per minute;
normal axis; left atrial abnormality; normal intervals and no
ST segment or T wave changes.

Her post catheterization electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus
tachycardia at 114 beats per minute; normal axis; left atrial
abnormality; normal intervals; one to two mm ST segment
elevations in V4 through V6 with reciprocal changes in leads
V1 and V2.

Cardiac catheterization demonstrated left ventricular
ejection fraction of 60%, right dominant system; 50% small
DLMCA, patent Left anterior descending stent, 60% ostial,
LCX, diffuse disease of obtuse marginal one and obtuse
marginal two; severe diffuse disease of obtuse marginal
three; 100% mid right coronary artery; patent saphenous vein
graft to posterior descending artery; 30% left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending at the distal left
internal mammary artery prior to touch down.  The procedure
was complicated by total occlusion of obtuse marginal three
after multiple attempts at pull back inflation through the
saphenous vein graft.  The remainder of the events following
the catheterization are as detailed in the history of present
illness.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.) Coronary artery disease.  As noted
above, the patient had an ST segment elevation, myocardial
infarction, presumably secondary to shower emboli after
attempted revascularization of her saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal three.  Her peak CK value was 878 and her
peak CKMB was 91.

The patient was continued on aspirin, Atorvistatin and
Copritigrel but her betablocker, [**Last Name (un) **] and all anticoagulants
were held in the setting of the presumed gastrointestinal
bleed she sustained in the catheterization laboratory.

By [**2153-1-24**], the patient's blood pressure had stabilized to
the point that a betablocker was able to be restarted and [**Last Name (un) **]
was restarted on [**2153-1-26**].

2.) Congestive heart failure.  As noted above, the patient
developed diastolic dysfunction in the catheterization
laboratory, in the setting of her acute myocardial
infarction.  She transiently required IABP for blood pressure
support.  She also remained on phenylephrine for blood
pressure support for approximately 36 hours following her
catheterization.  She eventually had an arterial line placed
for more accurate monitoring of her arterial blood pressure.
She subsequently received multiple courses of intravenous
Furosemide, in order to achieve adequate diuresis.  At the
time of her discharge from the hospital, the patient had been
restarted on her antihypertensive medications as listed
below.

3.) Blood loss anemia. As noted above, the patient had brown
emesis while in the catheterization laboratory.  Initially,
this emesis was thought to be coffee ground emesis,
especially given the patient's drop in hemoglobin while in
the catheterization laboratory.  However, the patient
subsequently had all guaiac negative
