Brief Hospital Course:
83 yof pt transferred from Caritas [**Hospital6 **] where
she was admitted on [**2110-6-12**] with an atypical chest pain and
backache, particularly when swallowing.
CXR showed large Hiatal hernia. While waiting for UGI in the
Radiology dept she developed respiratory distress and was
admitted to the ICU rxed with nebs and IV hydrocortisone.Later,
She had a CT scan without contrast since her Cr. was 2.1 which
revealed R parenchymal infilterates and markedly distended
esophagus. No free air was evident. GI was consulted for EGD,as
a safe measure pt was intubated pre EGD. During intubation pt
developed hypotension and ST elevation and loss of p waves with
junctional rhythm, which was very transient and troponins were
0.02, this was improved as soon as the pt was started on
pressors/ neosnephrine. Soon after, EGD was done that showed a
perforation just prox to GE junction , clipping attempted ,
failed to close the perforation. She was started on Levaquin
Clinda and Zosyn. Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation and
definitive management of esophageal perforation.

[**2110-6-14**] EGD performed on arrival to [**Hospital1 **] : At 30 cm we could see
the GE junction. Right there, there were several metallic clips
which had been placed by the outside gastroenterologist
presumably. At the site of these clips we could see perforation
which measured approximately 1 cm across. This was oriented
posteriorly in the esophagus. I went ahead and entered the
stomach and noted that it was extremely tortuous consistent with
the possible gastric volvulus suggested by the noncontrast CT
scan. I was not able to traverse the entirety of the stomach
down to the pylorus due to this tortuosity. There is no other
site of bleeding or perforation in the stomach. We went back and
visualized the replacement of the NG tube to make sure that it
went back into the stomach. The perforation itself looked
subacute but it was unclear exactly how old it was.  Patient was
admitted to ICU intubated and treated with antibiotics (Vanco,
cipro, flagyl, fluc). Extubated [**2110-6-16**] TPN started for
nutrition patient NPO. CXR RLL -? aspiration pneumonia. [**2110-6-19**]
transfered to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9 with NPO w/TPN/PICC line and continued on
antibiotics. On [**2110-6-27**] Patient taken for surgery for:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, laparoscopic giant paraesophageal
hernia repair and gastrostomy tube.  Patient did well transfered
back to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9 Continued on TPN and Antibiotics advancing diet
to full liquids.  Continued TPN adjusting as pos increased.
Daily Calorie Count and Crush all meds.
Transfered to rehab with TPN-wean on Full liquid diet only for
deconditioning and tx.
