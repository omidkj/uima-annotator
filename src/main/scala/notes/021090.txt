Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine / Oxycodone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial line

History of Present Illness:
89 year old male with HTN, CHF (EF 40%), chronic aspiration,
celiac sprue and recently diagnosed IgA nephropathy with
hemodialysis initiation in [**3-12**] and subsequent transfer to a
nursing home, who presents with a 2 weeks history of diarrhea,
found to be hypotensive at rehab.
.
The patient states that he has been having diarrhea for the last
week or so at rehab. He describes the diarrhea as soft stool
(not entirely unusual for him given his celiac disease), about 7
or so times per 24 hours. He is not sure whether or not it is
bloody. He has become progressively more fatigued over the week,
but otherwise has been feeling well. He denies any fevers or
chills, dysuria, cough, shortness of breath.
.
Of note, he had a recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**3-12**] for
acute on chronic renal failure at which time he was diagnosed
with IgA nephropathy and started on HD. During this
hospitalization he was diagnosed with C. Diff which was treated
initially with flagyl, but later changed to PO vancomycin given
concern that flagyl was contributing to mental status changes.
He completed a course of treatment at this time, extended to
last 5 days after completion of concurrent antibiotics for a
pneumonia. He reports symptomatic improvement in the interim.
.
On arrival to the ED, vitals were 98.6, 112, 80/42, RR 20, 100%
on RA. His blood pressure subsequently dropped to 69/39. He
received 2L IVF while in the ED. A femoral line was attempted
unsuccessfully. He received levofloxacin and flagyl. While in
the ED he was noted to have 2-3 episodes of ventricular
tachycardia on telemetry lasting about 15 seconds during which
time he was asymptomatic. An EKG after the episodes demonstrated
sinus tachycardia with T wave flattening throughout the
precordium, no ST segment changes. 1st set of enzymes with
troponin elevation, though normal CK. Patient denied any chest
pain currently, or in the past. He was given ASA 325 mg x 1 and
transferred to the MICU. Code confirmed as DNR/DNI.

Past Medical History:
1) Hypertension
2) Biventricular CHF: Last echo [**3-12**]. LVEF 40%, with RV systolic
function mildly depressed as well. Also with signs of diastolic
dysfunction.
3) Gout
4) Chronic renal insufficiency with superimposed acute renal
failure; renal biopsy in [**3-12**] with IgA nephropathy. Started on
HD during hospitalization in [**3-12**].
5) Celiac Sprue
6) History of aspiration pneumonia
7) History of MRSA pneumonia
8) History of Clostridium Difficile infection [**3-12**]
9) Anemia of chronic inflammation


Social History:
Patient currently living in a nursing home since last admission.
Prior to this he was living at home with his wife and daughter
in [**Name (NI) **], who helps take care of them. His wife is 86; they
have been married for 59 years, and have 3 children, two of whom
are in the area. He used to drink a drink or so per day; denies
any heavy drinking, and hasn't drank in about a year. He used to
smoke a PPD for many years, but quit 20 years ago. Denies IVDU.

Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
T 95.4, BP 60/22, HR 68, RR 15, 100% on RA.
I/O: [**2136**]/0 in ED, 450 since arrival to MICU.
Gen: Cachectic caucasian male, conversant, resting comfortably
in bed.
HEENT: Dry mucous membraines.
Neck: Strong carotid upstrokes. JVP not elevated.
Cor: RR, normal rate, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, though heart
sounds are distant.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath
sounds at L base and dullness to percussion.
Abd: Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, non-tender, non-distended.
Groin: R groin with bandage in place, no bruit or hematoma.
Extr: Extremities warm. No edema.
Rectal: Per ED, guaiac negative.

ASSAY-DETECTED

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Hypotension: On admission, there was clinical concern for
sepsis given hypotension, leukocytosis, and hypothermia. He was
covered empirically with broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and metronidazole). However, cultures remained
negative, and he responded promptly to aggressive fluid
resuscitation. He was given IVF boluses to maintain a MAP > 55.
By HD #[**2-9**], he was maintaining adequate blood pressures without
fluid boluses.  He completed a 7 day course of levofloxacin.
Flagyl was changed to vanco po for tx of C diff.  A cosyntropin
stimulation test was normal.
.
2) Diarrhea: Felt most likely from C. Diff colitis. He was
started on empiric metronidazole on admission and stool samples
sent for C Diff toxin assay. Toxin A assays returned negative x
3, and toxin B assay was sent. His diarrhea improved somewhat
with empiric metronidazole therapy, but continued to persist.
Despite negative laboratory data, there was high clinical
suspicion for C Diff. Oral vancomycin was added for coverage of
metronidazole resistant C Diff, with prompt response and near
resolution of his diarrhea. C Diff tox B assay returned positive
the day prior to discharge. By that time, he was having [**2-9**]
semiformed bowel movements per day.
.
4) Ventricular tachycardia: He had ventricular tachycardia in
the ED, possibly secondary to chronic scar given biventricular
failure. He had no signs of active ischemia. Troponin was
chronically elevated and unreliable in setting of end stage
renal disease, with a normal CK.  He had no further ventricular
tachycardia on telemetry.
.
5) Atrial tachycardia:  He had intermittent atrial tachycardia
during his hospitalization, with a rate of around 100. He seemed
to tolerate this well, without associated hypotension or
symptoms. His outpatient regimen of low dose metoprolol was
resumed prior to discharge.
.
6) IgA nephropathy/ESRD:  Dialysis was held for a number of days
after admission as his electrolytes continued to remain within
normal limits and he was not fluid overloaded even after
aggressive fluid resuscitation. Dialysis was eventually resumed,
with last session prior to discharge on [**6-14**]. He was continued on
epogen 5000 units QHD and nephrocaps. Phosphate binders were
held as his phosphate was low.
.
7) CHF: He had a history of biventricular heart failure, both
systolic and diastolic, therefore fluids were given judiciously
initially.  He continued to appear hypovolemic by exam, and
never had any signs of fluid overload other than mild bipedal
edema.
.
8) Mixed Respiratory and Metabolic acidosis:  He initially had
what appeared to be an acute respiratory acidosis based on ABG,
with additional metabolic AG acidosis (AG at 16, and expected
much lower given last albumin 2.2), in part secondary to lactic
acidosis, possibly also contribution of unmeasured anions in
renal failure. It is unclear what caused his respiratory
acidosis.  His metabolic acidosis resolved with treatment of his
sepsis and decrease in his lactate.
.
9) Eosinophilia:  He was noted to have a chronic eosinophilia.
