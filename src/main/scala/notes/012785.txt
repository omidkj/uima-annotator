Service:

This is a 70-year-old male with a prior history of myocardial
infarction and coronary artery bypass graft who was
originally diagnosed with coronary artery disease in [**2139**].
Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed significant
coronary artery disease and he had a coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2140**], saphenous vein graft to LAD and saphenous vein
graft to OM.  His last cardiac catheterization was [**2153**]
because of a positive stress.  It was revealed that the
distal OM was occluded at that time and the LAD and
circumflex was not able to be visualized.  The RCA had a 40%
lesion.  Angioplasty revealed that the venous graft was
occluded proximally and the venous graft to the LAD had a 90%
lesion.  The underlying successful stenting has saphenous
vein graft to LAD, was scheduled for a abdominal aortic
aneurysm repair on [**2158-10-23**].  In preparation for that, he
needed cardiac clearance and he underwent retesting which
showed an ejection fraction of 43% and carotid stenosis 50%
to 70%.  His stress test showed some inferior apical and
lateral wall ischemia as well.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease
2.  Peripheral vascular disease
3.  Hypertension
4.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm
5.  Hyperlipidemia
6.  Prior CVA

PAST SURGERIES:
1.  Right carotid endarterectomy
2.  Coronary artery bypass graft in [**2140**]

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 po qd
2.  Diltiazem 300 mg qd
3.  Atenolol 12.5 po qd
4.  Isordil 20 mg po tid

ADMISSION LABS:  White count was 8.2.  His hematocrit was
40.7.  His platelets were 247.  His INR was 1.05.  His sodium
was 1.1, potassium 4.6, chloride of 109, bicarbonate of 26,
BUN of 14, creatinine 1.1.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  He was afebrile.  Vital signs were stable.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils were equally round
and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles were intact.  He
had no jugular venous distention.  He had no bruits.  He had
an old scar from a right carotid endarterectomy.  He had a
medial sternotomy scar.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Bowel sounds were
present.
EXTREMITIES:  He had left saphenous removed.  Right saphenous
was in place and he had no palpable peripheral pulses.

He was taken to the Operating Room on [**2158-10-12**] where a redo
coronary artery bypass graft x3 was performed, left internal
mammary artery to LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM and
saphenous vein graft to PDA was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**].
The patient was transferred to the CSRU postoperatively.  The
patient was extubated overnight on [**2158-10-12**] and continued to
improve.

From a pulmonary standpoint, his chest tubes were left in due
to high output.  He was transferred to the floor
postoperatively, requiring high amount of oxygen.  On
[**2158-10-13**], he required 5 liters of nasal cannula as well as a
10 liter shovel mask to keep the saturations up.  His Foley
was in and his chest tubes were in at that time.  On [**2158-10-14**],
the patient had a desaturation, however he was asymptomatic
at the time.  He was given Lasix intravenous x2 and his
saturation improved.  He was transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring and more aggressive
diuresis.  He was also given albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizers to help open up his airways and increase his
breathing.

Physical therapy was consulted for ambulation and mobility.
He did well with them and they felt that he could possibly be
able to go home with services in the future.  Sputum cultures
were taken at the time of his return to the Intensive Care
Unit which were negative.  The patient was started on
levofloxacin for a presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia due to
high pulmonary vascularity on chest x-ray and the
decompensation of high sputum production.  The patient
continued to have high sputum output and would desat
occasionally, requiring suctioning and was able to bring out
a productive cough.  Release of the thick sputum would
increase his saturation as well as increasing his oxygen.
Levaquin was continued for a 10 day course.

Chest x-ray was done on [**2158-10-18**] which showed improvement of
his pulmonary function and the patient was transferred back
to the floor.  Foley was removed after arriving on the floor
and the patient continued to do well.  He was weaned down to
4 liters of nasal cannula and with aggressive pulmonary
toilet, deep breathing, coughing and ambulation.  The patient
was continued on his Lopressor and his wires were removed on
[**2158-10-19**].  The patient continued to be weaned from his oxygen
and at this time, date of discharge as well as discharge
medications will follow in an addendum.
