Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Headache

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
* intubation

History of Present Illness:
PER ADMITTING RESIDENT:
This is a 61 yo female with h/o hypertension, CAD, s/p
stents, who developed shortness of breath and lightheadedness
and
headache over the past 3 days.  She was being treated for
pneumonia and UTI by her primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and
predisone which both started on [**2108-1-18**].  She developed severe
headaches subsequently which the family were due to the [**Date Range **].
The PCP changed the medication to Levaquin on [**2108-1-20**], but the
headache persisted.  She presented to OSH ([**Hospital 84338**]) with shortness of breath and lightheadedness.
When she initally presented to the OSH ED, she was awake and
alert.  However, code stroke was called when she suddenly
developed left sided facial droop and weakness in the right arm
and leg.  She had a brief episode of eye blinking and shaking of
both arms.  Head CT showed an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage
along
the convexity of the left parietal lobe and a suggestion of
intraparencymal subtle hemorrhagic area in the left parietal
lobe. Prioir to transfer she was received lopressor 5 mg IV,
fosphenytoin 1 g, and 2 mg Ativan.  Chest X-ray showed changed
flattening the diaphragm and some mild blunting of the
costophrenic angles.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia with poor
R-wave progression in the anterior leads which is consistnet
with
her previous MI.  Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was noted to be
agitated.  She developed agonal breathing and was then
intubated.
CT/CTA was performed.

On neuro ROS, as above.

On general review of systems,her husband denies [**Name2 (NI) **] shehad
fever,
chills, neuasea, vomting, or other cymptoms.

IMAGING
.
CTA ([**2108-1-21**]):
IMPRESSION: Unchanged small volume of focal subdural and
subarachnoid
hemorrhage with no underlying vascular malformation, cerebral
venous
thrombosis or aneurysm identified.
.
CXR ([**2108-1-21**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. ETT 5 cm from the carina.
2. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality identified

CT head [**2108-1-26**]
FINDINGS: A non-contrast CT of the head was obtained. Again
noted is a small
amount of subdural hemorrhage layering along the
interhemispheric falx and
subarachnoid hemorrhage within the bilateral frontotemporal
sulci at the
cerebral convexities, mildly reduced in extent when compared to
the prior
study. There has been interval development of cortical and
subcortical
hypodensities within the bilateral posterior parietal lobes
extending
inferiorly into the occipital lobes, left greater than right.
There is no
evidence of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. No masses or shift of
midline
structures is identified. The ventricles are stable in size. The
basilar
cisterns are patent. The calvarium is intact. There is partial
opacification
of the left anterior ethmoidal air cells and mucosal thickening
within the
sphenoid sinuses.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of cortical and subcortical
hypodensities within the
posterior parietal and occipital lobes. Differential diagnosis
includes PRES
versus bilateral infarctions, possibly secondary to venous sinus
thrombosis.
No definite CT evidence of venous sinus thrombosis is
identified. MRI and MRV
are recommended for further characterization.
2. Slight interval decrease in extent of subdural and
subarachnoid hemorrhage
within the bilateral frontotemporal regions at the cerebral
convexities.

MRI/V [**2108-1-27**]
1. Non-arterial distribution infarcts with large regions of
restricted
diffusion involving the left parietooccipital lobes, right
parietal lobe, and
additional scattered punctate foci within the right frontal
lobe. Stable
subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage, as described above.

No evidence of arterial thrombosis, medium-to-large intracranial
vessel
vasospasm or vasculitis (though MRI/MRA may be insensitive), or
cerebral
venous thrombosis.

2. Mucosal thickening and fluid with near-complete opacification
of the left
maxillary sinus and partial opacification of the anterior left
ethmoid air
cells, not significantly changed in extent compared to CTA of
one day prior.

These findings were discussed at-length with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Stroke
service), by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], on [**2108-1-27**] at 4:30 PM; by exclusion, this may
represent a severe
case of Call-[**Doctor Last Name 8271**] pathophysiology, proceding to infarction,
in a patient
with severe underlying vascular disease.

TTE [**2108-1-31**]
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). The aortic valve is not
well seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot
be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild to
moderate ([**1-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but can
