Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status, Hypotension, Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line placement and removal
Endotracheal intubation (done at outside hospital)/extubation


History of Present Illness:
45 year old female who was initially brought into an OSH ER by
ambulance after being called by her boyfriend due to her being
combative and with altered mental status. By EMS report on the
scene she was physically restrained by police officers and
covered in feces, apparently her boyfriend admitted that she had
been drinking for the past week. At the OSH she was very
agitated and combative, she was sedated and intubated to
complete imaging studies and for airway protection. She was
known to their hospital and by report had been drinking heavily
previously, they were concerned that this could be related to
alcohol withdrawal. A CT head at the OSH was negative, she had a
fever to 101, found to be hypokalemic, hypomag and was given
vanc/cefepime and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further
evaluation.

[**2108-7-12**]: CT abd/pelvis/chest
CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST ONLY: Right IJ line
terminates
within the mid SVC and the patient is intubated with the tip of
the
endotracheal tube terminating just below the thoracic inlet.
There is likely
some gas within a mediastinal vein just posterior to the sternum
likely
related to injection with the heart and great vessels appearing
otherwise
unremarkable with mild atherosclerotic calcifications involving
the aortic
arch and aortic root. No large pleural or pericardial effusions
are present.
Some scattered mediastinal nodes are identified, the largest 7
mm in short
axis within the lower right paratracheal chain. There are
biapical bullae
with no other concerning opacities and nodules within the lungs.


CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST: There is
diffuse fatty
infiltration of the liver with no focal concerning hepatic
lesions identified.
Moderate amount of pericholecystic fluid is noted and periportal
fluid and the
gallbladder is moderately distended. The spleen, adrenal glands,
and right
kidney appear unremarkable. There is suggestion of pancreatic
divisum, but
normal szie to the pancreatic duct. Small hypoattenuating lesion
in the upper
pole of the left kidney is noted, likely a benign cyst, but too
small to
definitely characterize. Multiple short segment jejunojejunal
intussusceptions are noted within the left upper quadrant with
no findings of bowel obstruction or enhancing lead points seen.
Mild induration is noted within the mesentery, likely related to
edema and free fluid. No
pathologically enlarged lymph nodes or free air.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST: Large bowel
and appendix as well as the uterus and adnexae appearing
unremarkable. Air is noted within a Foley containing urinary
bladder. A mild amount of free fluid is noted within the
cul-de-sac. No pathologically enlarged pelvic sidewall or
inguinal lymph nodes are present.

BONE WINDOWS: No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are seen. A
healed left sixth rib fracture is noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. No etiology for fever identified.

2. Fatty deposition in the liver. Pericholecystic fluid,
gallbladder wall
edema and intra-abdominal fluid suggestive of underlying
aggressive fluid
resuscitation/third spacing. If there remains a clinical concern
for acute
cholecystitis, a dedicated ultrasound would be recommended.

3. Small short segment jejunojejunal intussusceptions without
obvious lead
point. These are often seen in the adult population transiently
and likely of no significance, in this case possibly related to
third-spacing. No findings of bowel obstruction.

4. Possible pancreatic divisum without pancreatic abnormalities.


[**2108-7-13**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to attenuate,
slowing
and disorganization of the background rhythm. This finding is
consistent with a severe encephalopathy. Medications,
toxic-metabolic
disturbances and infections are common causes. Anoxia is also a
possible etiology. No areas of focal slowing, epileptiform
features or
electrographic seizures were seen during this recording. IF
clinically
indicated, a repeat routine EEG may be repeated once sedation is

lightened for further evaluation.

[**2108-7-13**] ECHO
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the distal half of the
anterior septum and anterior walls, distal inferior wall, and
apex. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30-35 %).
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
anterior space which most likely
