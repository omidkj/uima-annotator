Brief Hospital Course:
57F with IDDM s/p kidney transplant, CABG X2 [**71**], right BKA [**5-6**],
CHF who presented for cardiac cath after NSTEMI at OSH and had
respiratory arrest, intubated [**1-17**] in setting on epistaxis on
anticoagulation/integrillin, extubated [**1-18**] with ongoing
management of aspiration pneumonia and CHF who is now requesting
medical management from this point forward.
.
1) CV
--CAD:  hx CABG with recent NSTEMI with Trop peak 37.4 at OSH
and recent peak 1.17 TropT. Pt is refusing cath and requests
medical management of her CAD, continued asa, plavix, bb,and
statin.  Ace added to regimen.
--PUMP:  Bivent failure by recent echo. EF20%. Continued CHF
managment with diuresis and afterload reduction given depressed
EF and evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Starting ACE
inhibitor. Will titrate as kidney function tolerates
--Rhythm: NSR, cont BB for rate control
.
2)[**Name (NI) 22118**] Pt had a respiratory arrest on [**1-17**] in AM
secondary to a severe epistaxis with aspiration in the setting
of having been on integrillin and with a supratherapeutic
heparin level.  Pt was intubated and transferred to the CCU
where her anticoagulation was reversed and her epistaxis was
managed with nasal packing.
Pt was extubated the following day.
.
3)Renal- Per renal recs, continued to hold CSA until level <50.
Check daily CSA levels. Continued cellcept. Started tacrolimus
per renal recs.  Cr improved to 1.7 which is c/w baseline.
Started lasix at 80mg IV BID per renal recs.
.
4)DM-continued lantus with RISS (humalog), FS QID, diabetic
diet, [**Name (NI) 653**] [**Name (NI) **] MD, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
.
5)PVD s/p right BKA and with left bypass- pt is s/p right BKA.
Pt reported recent injury to stump. No signs of infection
.
6)ID- At the OSH, pt was found to have a fever, neutropenia,
atypical lymphs, and a bandemia. She had been given empiric
zosyn for the fever and at OSH CXR neg for pna, just CHF.  On
the morning after transfer pt has repiratory code from likely
aspiration event from epistaxis.  CXR showed new upper lobe
inflitrates. ID team was consulted who recommended initial
coverage with vanc/zosyn.
.
[**1-21**]: spiked temp o/n; pan-Cx, CXR, diff on WBC, C. diff etc.
Renal team switching CSA-->tacrolimus, no clear plan to reduce
immunosuppression, but hopefully.
[**2091-1-21**]: fever curve improved with nothing but continued zosyn;
fever w/u (BCx, UA/UCx, C. diff) so far unrevealing as to
etiology of that fever spike [**2089-1-18**]. Found out that she took
10D of cipro PTA for ? UTI (she apparently has chronic UTIs and
often is on chronic cipro tx), also had some LGT prior to admit,
so maybe she did have a viral syndr. As of [**1-23**] sats
improved significantly with diuresis (were 82% on RA on [**1-22**]-91% RA on [**1-23**]. Note was 93% on 2L on admit to [**Hospital1 18**]), so
holding off on induced sputum for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Cx, GS/CX etc.
f/u CXR [**1-21**] actually improved LLL infiltrate
.
[**2178-1-23**]: Afebrile now for 2 days. O2sat=90 on RA. Needs to be
further diuresed. optimize med management. Started Toprol XL
.
At time of discharge, pt was on zosyn for treatment of
aspiration pneumonia. Blood cultures, urine cultures were
negative to date.
