History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 57 yo man with h/o alcohol abuse, COPD, schizoaffective
d/o, remote h/o seizures, who was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**]
hospital s/p fall on [**2144-6-20**] with 3 rib fractures, and
hemopneumothorax requiring chest tube. Pt fell on his left side
while on a 5 foot wall, hitting his left chest. There was no
LOC. His wife called 911 as he was having trouble. At [**Hospital1 1562**],
he was found to have the broken ribs and hemopneumothorax, and
the chest tube was inserted. There were continued problems
oxygenating the patient; CT PE protocol was negative and
bronchoscopy was done which did not reveal any bronchial
obstructing lesions, and only a small amount of mucous. He was
then intubated at [**Hospital1 1562**] for respiratory failure.  His course
was also complicated by hypotension (briefly on levophed),
evidence of RV strain (resolved after chest tube), and HCT drop
to 29 (s/p 3 units of PRBCs). Sputum micro at OSH showed GP and
pt was started on Linezolid and levaquin (d/cd at [**Hospital1 18**]).

Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. He was
noted to have a large Aa gradient while vented. Pt was initially
started on heparin gtt for a question of ischemic stroke. Head
CT and MRI were negative and this was then d/cd. There was
question one night of seizure like activity but the story was
unclear and EEG was not consistent with seizure activity. Pt was
extubated on [**2144-6-27**]. After extubation, pt was answering
questions unintelligibly, moaning, or looking away. The SICU
team has been trying to avoid sedating medications, but he does
require morphine for pain. Per psychiatry, risperdone and
mirtazapine (which the patient is on at home) were discontinued
(abilify and effexor had been stopped earlier). Chest tube was
d/cd on [**2144-6-29**]. Early am [**2144-6-30**] pt had a.fib ~150. He was
given diltiazem and metoprolol with little effect. He was loaded
with amiodarone and cardioverted. Pt continues to be delirious
and is transferred to medicine for further work-up.

Radiology:
[**2144-6-24**]- CT head without contrast
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Fluid and
opacification of the sinuses and mastoid air cells. There are
two small equivocal hypodensities in the medial right temporal
lobe, vaguely defined, of unclear significance.

[**2144-6-24**]- CTA chest, abdomen, pelvis
1) Rib fractures.
2) Bilateral lower lobe collapse with small surrounding
effusions.
3) Chest tube in left hemithorax.
4) Small amount of ascites.
5) Some thickening and stranding in the left pararenal fascia of
unclear significance, also about the left kidney and pancreas.
6) Small abdominal aortic aneurysm.

[**2144-6-25**] Echo-
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.

[**2144-6-26**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]-
No evidence of acute ischemia/infarction,intracranial mass
effect, or hemorrhage.

[**2144-7-2**]- CXR (AP)-1) Right sided diffuse patchy and ground glass
opacities that likely represent lung contusion but could also be
asymmetric fluid overload vs. infection.
2) NG tube in stomach.

[**2144-6-30**]-EEG- Consistent with diffuse, mild encephalopathy.


Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 57 yo male with history of EtOH abuse (sober), COPD,
bipolar disorder, transferred from OSH with hemopneumothorax s/p
chest tube, respiratory distress s/p intubation.

Chest Trauma
The patient had a mechanical fall of off a 5 foot ladder landing
on his left side.  He was taken to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital where he
was noted to have three rib fractures and left sided
hemopneumothorax.  He was also in respiratory distress.  His
cervical spine was stabilized, he was intubated and a left-sided
chest tube was placed.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.  The patient was admitted to the SICU, and did well
from a trauma standpoint: he was extubated, the chest tube was
removed, and his pain was well controlled.  His cervical, lumbar
and thoracic spine was cleared clinically and his collar was
then removed.  Radiographs of his full spine did not show any
evidence of fracture of dislocation.  He was then transferred to
the medicine service on [**2144-7-2**] for further management of
delirium.

Delirium
After extubation the patient was confused and disoriented,
though his neurological exam was non focal.  The differential
included infection, a toxic-metabolic cause, stroke, or seizure.
 He had been febrile at [**Hospital 1562**] hospital and had been started
on broad spectrum coverage (linezolid and levaquin), but these
was stopped on transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  CXR did not show a clear
pneumonia.  Urine was positive for a pan sensitive enterococcus,
and he was started on a 7 day course of antibiotics (initially
levofloxacin and then vanco given the reinitiation of
amiodarone).  His MRI and CT scans were negative for stroke.  An
EEG was done and was not consistent with seizure.  The patient
had been receiving ativan and morphine, and had become
hypernatremic since admission to 152, all of whic
