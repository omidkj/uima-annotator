Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Decannulation of tracheostomy.


History of Present Illness:
84 year-old female with history of subglottic stenosis who
presented to an outside hospital with shortness of breath.  Her
shortness of breath began on the morning of admission.  She
states that she was sitting when this occurred and that it has
been progressing over the last few days.  She notes a cough
productive of white sputum.  She denies fevers or chills.  She
reports mild chest pain when she was dyspneic.  She describes it
as substernal without radiation or associated nausea/vomiting.

Her subglottic stenosis developed after prolonged tracheal
intubation in the setting of cardiopulmonary arrest in [**9-22**].
She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy for leiomyosarcoma,
during which she sustained damage to her left ureter.
Ultimately, a left nephrectomy complicated by spelenectomy was
performed, and the she was vent-dependent for 2-3 weeks.  A
tracheostomy was then placed, and she was mechanically
ventilated  for 6 weeks.  A tracheoscopy in [**5-24**] revealed
stenosis above the trach tube and complete, intermittent
collapse of trachea.  In [**6-23**], she underwent rigid bronchoscopy
and microdebridement of granulation tissue, as well as placement
of T tube.  Of note, she has had 4 episodes of pneumonia in 6
months.

On transfer here, there was difficulty bag ventilating her via
her T tube.  On arrival, she was notably dyspneic with accessory
muscle use and respiratory distress.  Her systolic pressure was
up to 180s, heart ratae in 120s, and she was satting in mid-90s.
 Her T tube was manually removed, and a cuffed 8.0 tube was
inserted in its place.  Her breathing was imediately more
comfortable, SBP decreased to 110s-120s.

microdebridement of granulation tissue [**6-23**]

occasional social alcohol when dines out, denies IVDU.  Is able
to walk around at home, no problems eating.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  84 year-old female with subglottic stenosis who presented
with clogged T tube.

1.  Airway obstruction - Her T-tube was removed and it was
completely clogged likely secondary to lack of suctioning of the
tracheostomy.  A cuffed tracheostomy tube was place.
Interventional pulmonary performed a rigid bronchoscopy that
showed supraglottic edema and swelling of the false cords.  A
fenestrated tracheostomy was placed at that time.  She was
evaluated by ENT who felt that her airway was patent and that
she did not require the tracheostomy.  She underwent a cap trial
and did well for 20 hours without desaturation.  She was
subsequently decannulated and she continued to saturate well on
room air.

2. Leukocytosis: She had an elevated white count on admission
with a questionable retrocardiac opacity on the outside
hospital's chest x-ray.  However, a repeat chest x-ray showed no
infiltrate.  She did not have any symptoms of pneumonia.  A
sputum culture was checked.  On hospital day 2, she had low
grade temperatures, with persistent leukocytosis.  She was
started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin of possible
community acquired pneumonia.  The sputum culture remained
negative for 72 hours.  The ceftriaxone was discontinued.  She
was discharged on azithromycin for a 7-day course given her low
grade temps and continued leukocytosis.

2.  Tachycardia - She was initially tachycardic, which was
attributed to respiratory distress and hypovolemia.  She was no
longer tachycardic after fluid resuscitation.

3.  Acute renal failure - On initial presentation, her
creatinine was 1.2.  She was likely hypovolemic.  Her creatinine
improved with fluid resuscitation.

4.  Hyperglycemia - Her initial blood glucose was close to 300,
which was likely secondary to stress.  She was started on an
insulin sliding scale.  Over the next 24 hours, her blood
glucose remained stable between 100-120.  The insulin sliding
scale was discontinued

5.  History of depression - She had no signs of depression
throughout the admission.  Her outpatient Lexapro was continued.

6.  Hypertension - Her blood pressures remained well controlled
on her outpatient medications, amlodipine, lisinopril, and
metoprolol.

7.  FEN - She was maintained on a low sodium diet.  She was
initial fluid resuscitated to correct acute renal failure and
tachycardia.  Her potassium was repleted.

8.  Prophylaxis - She was maintained on pneumoboots and a PPI.

9.  Access: She had peripheral IV access.

10. Code: Full

11. Disposition: She was discharged to home after decannulation.
 She was oxygenation well on room air.
