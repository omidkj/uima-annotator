Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**]
Chief Complaint:
Lightheadedness, dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with no prior cardiac hx following p/w 2 day history of
light-headedness, weakness, sweating, dizziness. Symptoms
started while he was out for a walk on Monday, where he had a
sudden onset of lightheadedness and he had to sit down. The
symptoms have been continuous since Monday. His son notes that
the patient is normally very active and independent for ADLs.
Patient took some of his neighbor's dizziness medication' which
is believed to be meclizine, also took some additional Ambien,
possibly 15mg. His denied chest pain, arm pain, diaphoresis on
admission.

In the ED, his initial vitals were 98.9, 125/64, 106, 20, 95% on
RA. EKG showed new atrial flutter with varying conduction and
old LBBB. He received Diltiazem 10mg PO with good HR response
into 80s. Son describes notable improvement s/p treatment in ED.
On arrival to the floor, 96.1, 128/84, 80, 20, 93% on 2L NC. He
has no home O2 requirement.

At 10pm, pt received ambien and 30mg po diltiazem--per nurse he
was in NAD. 30 minutes later, he was found restless and
diaphoretic with sat=75% on 3LNC. HR was in 130s. NRB +6LNC
placed and pt's sat rose to 92%. ABG done at that time
7.30/52/58.  He was given albuerol nebs, 20mg IV lasix, and 10mg
IV diltiazem. CXR showed worsened pulmonary vascular congestion
compared to admission film 8hrs prior. HR decreased to 80s and
sats remained in 93-96% range on NRB. He was given another 20mg
IV lasix.  Pt transfered to MICU for closer monitoring.

Imaging:
CXR Portable [**2117-7-7**]:
Moderate congestive heart failure. Consolidation cannot be
excluded particularly at the left lung base and repeat
radiographs following
treatment are recommended.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-7-10**] 9:18 PM
Final Report
HISTORY: Fever and increased oxygen requirement, to evaluate for
volume
overload or pneumonia.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-8**], there has been
some
improvement in the pulmonary vascular congestion. The pleural
effusion on the
right has decreased, as _____ on the left. Persistent
opacification in the
retrocardiac region most likely represents atelectasis.

[**2117-7-8**]      ECHO

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 20%), c/w global process (toxic, metabolic,
tachycardia-related) or multivessel coronary disease.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global
hypokinesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with no prior cardiac hx p/w lightheadedness x 2 days
and is found to be in heart failure (as evidenced by pulmonary
edema and elevated JVP) likely secondary to new atrial flutter
with RVR.
.
Hypoxia/Pulmonary Edema: Occurred in the setting of rapid atrial
fibrillation.  He has no history of cardiac disease but has
evidence of cardiomegaly on CXR and BNP [**Numeric Identifier 5675**] on transfer to
MICU.  He had three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
Echocardiogram c/w systolic CHF with an EF of 20%. He was
diuresed with IV lasix 20 mg x 2 and started on diltiazem with
good effect. Echocardiogram was pending at time of transfer to
the floor.
.
Atrial Fibrillation: Given his level of dunction and the degree
to which he becomes symptomatic with RVR, could consider EP
consult for flutter ablation.  Improved rate control with
diltiazem which was uptitrated to 60mg qid.  Echocardiogram with
severe global hypokinesis with EF 20%, nl atria.  No evidence of
right heart strain. [**Numeric Identifier **]. TSH nl. Patient would qualify for
long term anticoagulation by CHADs criteria but this will need
to be discussed with his family and PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to r/o DVT (neg
on prelim read)
.
Systolic CHF: Dilated left ventricle with severe global
hypokinesis, EF 20% as well as [**12-25**]+ MR. Ddx global process
(toxic, metabolic, tachycardia-related) v. multivessel coronary
disease.
- Consider changing dilt to beta blocker
- Diuresis prn
- Discuss starting ASA, ACE-I w/ PCP/family given age
- Will need outpt heart failure f/u
.
Chronic cough/TB rule out: Patient is elderly and from [**Country 532**].
Initially concern for TB given abnormal CXR with chronic cough
occassionally productive of sputum. Placed on respiratory
isolation. However, precautions and work-up discontinued as
thought unlikely.
.
Anxiety: Continue citalopram.
.
Insomnia: Per son, is very anxious about his sleep and
constantly requrests ambien.
- Prn for insomnia.
.
FEN: No IVF, diurese, replete electrolytes, regular diet
Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
Access: Peripherals x2
Code: Full discussed with patient via son as translator
Communication: Patient + son
