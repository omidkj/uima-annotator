STUDIES:

CT C Spine: No prevetebral soft tissue abnormality, no fracture
or malalignment. No foraminal narrowing / central stenosis.
Extensive bullous change within lung apices captured in field
1. no fracture / malalignment
2. biapical bollous change

CT HEAD
Non contrast CT without edema, mass or hemorrahge.
Encephalomalacia stable on left temporal lobe as in MRI [**5-29**].
Ventricles and sulci normal, tiny left parietal scalp hematoma.

# no acute intracraneal process

ECG: ([**2-22**] 22:53)
Normal sinus rhythm at 83bpm, ther is baseline artifact and no
significant ST segment abnormalities.

CXR [**2163-2-23**]: Heart size is top normal, stable. Mediastinal
position is stable, unremarkable. Lungs are essentially clear.
Bilateral apical lucencies might be consistent with emphysema.
There are no areas of consolidation worrisome for infectious
process or aspiration.

CT scan thoracic/lumbar spine [**2163-2-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild convex left curvature of the thoracic spine, otherwise
normal CT study of the thoracic and lumbar spine. No abnormal
paravertebral soft tissue or fluid collection is seen. No
abnormality detected within the spinal canal on CT; however, if
there is concern for abnormality within the spinal canal, MRI
would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation.
2. Mildly sclerotic focus in the right iliac bone, along the
sacroiliac spine, of uncertain etiology but is
well-circumscribed, with non-aggressive features.
3. Bullous emphysematous changes of the upper lobes again noted.
Evidence of prior granulomatous disease in the lungs.
Additionally, with 7-mm spiculated nodule in the left lower lobe
of uncertain etiology. Given emphysematous changes, and size of
this lesion, initial followup CT would be recommended at three
months' time by [**Last Name (un) 8773**] society guidelines.
4. Small pelvic free fluid, incompletely visualized and of
indeterminate clinical significance.

Plain films of left foot [**2163-2-26**]:
FINDINGS: No comparisons available. The soft tissues of the
fifth left digit are swollen. There is a small axial deviation.
The most peripheral to the bony components appear irregularly
margined and slightly sclerotic at their borders. The picture
would be consistent with the degenerative rather than with the
destructive or chronic inflammatory change. There is no evidence
of cortical disruption that would suggest a traumatic origin of
the changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
41 year old man with past medical history significant for EtOH
abuse, c/b withdrawal seizures, with ? bipolar disorder,
presenting to ED by EMS after being found intoxicated on the
street, in fair condition.

# INTOXICATION: On admission, patient was minimally responsive,
with very high EtOH level ~3 hours after transfer to ED,
suggesting exceedingly high levels when found on the street.
Concern for ingestion of secondary substance, however serum osm
gap is exactly that predicted for this degree of EtOH ingestion.

Given history of seizure disorder, would also consider partial
complex seizure at this time, however given pts ability to move
all extremities and become verbally abusive and combative this
was felt to be much less likely.  Patient however was started on
CIWA with IV Diazepam shortly after ICU transfer due to severe
diaphoresis and tremulouness. OSH records obtained from last [**Hospital1 2025**]
ED admission 4 days PTA, and prior notes of similar breakthrough
seizures requiring loading with dilantin. Baseline levels of
dilantin were negative, patient was loaded with Phophenytoin and
continued on oral load. Patient was also given IV thiamine and
folate and transitioned over to oral agents and later to
multivitamin.
Patients withdrawal symptoms were appropiately treated and no
withdrawal seizures were observed. Ataxia was noted on physical
exam, and degeneration of cerbellar vermis was noted on prior
MRI imaging, likely alcohol-related. Patient was encouraged to
follow up with recommendations of social work to assist with
alcohol cessation, although was minimally receptive to these
suggestions.

# HYPOTHERMIA / LEUKOPENIA: At presentation thought likely due
to immobilization from EtOH stupor and exposure to cold. Body
temperature normalized with conservative therapy, however in
light of leukopenia pre-emptive infectious workup was pursued
including blood and urine cultures, chest x-ray, sputum cultures
and viral infection workup. WBC continued to trend downward
until ANC was less than ~500 and Patient developed fever after
warming up to 102. He was started on Cefepime / Vancomycin.
Given complaints of back pain, CT Thoracic and Lumbar spine were
obtained which revealed no concerning findings to explain
leukopenia. Blood cultures from admission revealed a single
bottle ([**1-23**]) with corynebacterium, felt to be a contaminant.
Fevers resolved and antibiotics were stopped. The leukopenia
improved slightly prior to discharge (ANC > 500) and was felt
most likely secondary to alcohol abuse.

# FACIAL LAC: Repaired in ED, Tetanus shot given. Unable to
assess for ligamentous neck trauma given profound intoxication
on admission. Patient maintained on [**Location (un) 2848**]-J collar until mental
status improver and there was full ROM and no point tenderness.
CT c-spine and head were negative for acute process. Lesion was
reasonably well-healed at time of discharge.

# SEIZURE DISORDER: As above, patient starte
