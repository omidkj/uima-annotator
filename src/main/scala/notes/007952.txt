STUDIES:
CXR ([**6-29**]): The heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are unremarkable. The left lung is clear. There is a
moderate-sized right pleural effusion obscuring the right
hemidiaphragm and right heart border with adjacent
consolidation. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
.
TTE ([**6-29**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40%), possibly in
part secondary to tachycardia. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation is seen on the
mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Mild global
left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

RUQ ULTRASOUND ([**6-30**]): 1. Diffusely echogenic liver consistent
with fatty infiltration. However, other forms of diffuse liver
disease including significant fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be
excluded on this study.
2. Right pleural effusion, without right upper quadrant ascites.

CTA CHEST ([**7-1**]): There is a small-to-moderate right pleural
effusion with areas of loculation. An area of consolidation is
seen within the left lung base (3, 62). In addition, a rounded
area of increased density (3, 41) is identified near the right
hilum and measures approximately 1.4 x 2.3 cm likely represents
a lymph node. Multiple scattered
