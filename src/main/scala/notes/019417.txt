CT C-spine [**2139-3-13**]:
Bilateral fracture of the transverse processes of C6, possibly
comminuted on the right. Severe disruption of the anterior
longitudinal ligament with fracture extending through, and
marked widening of the intervertebral disk space, particularly
anteriorly, with disruption of the calcifications of the
anterior longitudinal ligament and lordotic angulation of the
cervical spine at this level. There appears to be deformation of
the thecal sac. These results were communicated immediately to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 59135**] of trauma at the time of image aquisition and
interpretation.

Ct head [**2139-3-13**]:
Large right subdural hematoma, containing multiple densities,
including a fluid-fluid level and an area of high-density
hemorrhage anteriorly, consistent with acute on subacute
subdural hemorrhage. Marked mass effect, with right to left
subfalcine herniation, unca; herniation, and leftward
displacement of the brainstem. No fractures identified. These
results were called immediately to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the trauma
service.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] [**2139-3-14**]:
1. Widening of the disc space anteriorly at the C6-7 level,
indicative of acute injury in a patient with fused cervical
spine from DISH.
2. Small amount of fluid collection posterior to the C6
vertebral body in the epidural region, indicates a small epidura
hematoma or effusion. In absence of significant marrow edema to
the vertebral bodies, the presence of these epidural
hematomas/fluid collections, is suggestive of acute trauma. No
evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities. Other
changes as above.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neurological: patient was diagnosed with a large right subdural
hematoma acute on chronic and midline shift and ? early
herniation. Neurosurgical service was notified and recommended
hematoma evacuation after coags are corrected. In the mean time,
after long discussion with the family, patient's wife and
daughter wanted to hold off on all agressive treatments and
intubation while they are making the decision on further
management. At the mean time patient was admitted to Trauma ICU,
he started to recieve vitamin K and FFP to correct his
coagulopathy. His mental status was followed closely with serial
exam. @)5:30 patient and his family made a decision to proceed
fully with all treatments and he was booked for the operating
room. @0700 patient mental status started to deteriorate, he was
intubated and taken emergently to the operating room to hematoma
evacuation, which was done successfully. Please see operating
note for details. In the following weeks patient had a few
follow up CT scan which showed not acute changes. he was
eventually weaned off all sedation.
Now: moving lower extremities spontaneously, moving RUE,
withdrawing LUE to pain. opening eyes spontaneously, minimal
tracking, does not follow commands. he has been stable in this
condition, making very slow progress with movements.
##
Cardiovascular: Patient had multiple cardiac risk factors,
postoperativly developed worsening congestive heart failure,
which was treated with minimizing IVF and lasix diuresis.
Patient had an echocardiogram which showed an EF<40%, worsening
of RV function and septal defect, as compare to pre-admission
studies, most likely indication MI prior to admission. While in
the hospital patient had no acute EKG changes (pre or post
operatively), he initially had a troponin leak, but never
qualified for frank MI. Post operatively patient had
dysrhythmia's, including non sustained ventricular tachycardia,
PAC, PVC, his electrolytes were normalized. Cardiology and EP
services were consulted. Their evaluation revealed most likely a
cardiac event in the past, and recommendation included
continuing b-blockade, starting ACE inhibitor and aldactone for
cardioprotection and further CAD work up in the future. Also
started on amiodarone. Anticoagulation when possible (4 weeks
after initial even by neurosurgery)
##
Respiratory: patient has significant COPD history with home O2,
he also and CHF in the initial parts of his hospitalization,
which resolved with diuresis. Once intubated however, we had
hard time weaning patient off the vent. Most likely as
combination of both decreased mental status and significant
respiratory diseas. For that reason tracheostomy was performed.
After that procedure, patient weannig has expedited. no evidence
of pneumonia. As part of the work up of his fever and
disrythmia, patient had CTA of the chest which revealed no PE
and bilateral pleural effusion, L>R. Pleural tap was performed
on the left side, with 900cc of clear staw fluid, culture
negative to date.
Now: weaning of the vent, tolerating longer and longer periods
of trach mask. no evidence of infection, no evidence of CHF
##
GI: through out this admission patient had no GI symptoms, he
tolerated TF well, and PEG was placed once it was clear that he
will be ventilator dependant for a while. No concerns no issues
##
Renal: Through out the admission patient renal function remained
stable, tolerated lasix diuresis. no concerns no issues
##
FEN: after patient operative management was completed, he was
started on tube feedings through initially NGT and then PEG.
patient tolerating tube feedings well and is currently on goal
nutrition.
Through his hospital admission, patient had intermittent
hypokalemia, hypomagnesimia, hypophosphatemia which was
corrected accordingly
##
Endo: with history of diabetes mellitus type 2, patient remained
on insulin drip through most of his icu stay (able to keep his
blood glucose in
