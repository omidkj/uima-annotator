Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension/cellulitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left internal jugular line placement

History of Present Illness:
76 yo F with AF, CAD s/p CABG, h/o cellultis, who presents from
home with worsening R leg infection. On [**Name (NI) 2974**], pt noticed a
swelling on her right lateral leg with redness. this progressed
over the next few days followed by pain in the last two days.
Denies fevers, but has some chills. No N/V, few loose BM's/day
over last few days. No cough/SOB. Also noted [**Month (only) **] UOP with ok
fluid intake but poor appetite.
.
Seen at OSH today where she was noted to have a large
cellulitis. Her BP was 80's without sxs. She was started on
levofed after being given 2.5 L IVF. A CVL was placed. She was
given clinda/vanc and a surgery consult was called which r/o
necrotizing fascitis. She was sent to [**Hospital1 **] for further care.
.
In the ED, VS 97.3, 80, 80/42, 16, 98%. Exam with 10-20 cm right
erythema to thigh, no skin breakdown. Vascular consult who
reccomended f/u cultures and monitoring exam of leg. Given add'l
clinda/vancomycin in the ED. UO notd to be poor--20 cc total. On
50 mcg of levofed on transfer.
.
Admitted to the ICU for sepsis.
.
In the MICU, surgery consult ruled out necr. fascitis. In the
unit required levophed for hypotension, echo with preserved EF
and severe TR. Mildly elevated LFTs, and CT abdomen with 4X 4 cm
AAA. (per PCP 3.5 cm AAA 3 yeras ago in '[**96**]). Vascular
following. Leg improved. Lateral leg ruptured bullae so Derm
followed. Initially on vanc/clinda for 3 days with some
improvement but due to leucocytosis so started unasysn. failed
[**Last Name (un) 104**] stiim got steroids for 5 days. This AM went into rapid a.
fib (given 5 mg iv lopressor). Started on metoprolol 25 (outpt
dose 75).

IMAGING:
CXR: FINDINGS: Consistent with the given history, a left
internal jugular approach central line has been placed. The
distal tip lies in the brachiocephalic vein proximal to the
junction with the superior vena cava. There is evidence of prior
median sternotomy and CABG. Consistent with the prior report,
there is massive cardiomegaly and chamber enlargement. A double
density is noted with splaying of the carina consistent with
left atrial enlargement in particular. There is no focal
consolidation. No significant cephalization is evident although
there is interlobular septal thickening noted in the periphery.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.

IMPRESSION: Left internal jugular approach central line as above
with no pneumothorax. Massive cardiomegaly. Interlobular septal
thickening of indeterminate acuity. Regardless, there is no
evidence to suggest significant volume overload.
.
LENIs: FINDINGS: Ultrasound evaluation of the right and left
lower extremity deep venous system using grayscale, color, and
pulse wave Doppler demonstrates the veins to be fully
compressible with normal Doppler waveforms, augmentation, and
respiratory variation in flow.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT involving the right or left lower
extremities.
.
ECHO: Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
appears dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation jet is eccentric.  The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Abdominal Ultrasound: FINDINGS: The liver is normal in
echotexture without evidence of focal lesion. There is a
questionable tiny hyperechogenic focus in the gallbladder neck
that could represent a small gallstone vs. polyp. No evidence of
cholecystitis. No evidence of intra or extrahepatic biliary
ductal dilatation and the common duct measures 5 mm. Main portal
vein is patent with antegrade flow. The pancreas appears normal.
The aorta demonstrates a fusiform aneurysm on its mid portion
measuring 4.2 x 3.9 cm. The right kidney measures 10.8 cm and
the left 11.8 cm. The renal parenchymal thickness is normal.
There is a 9 mm non-obstructive stone in the left kidney. No
evidence of hydronephrosis. No evidence of free fluid.
IMPRESSION:
1) 4.2 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm.
2) 9 mm non-obstructive left renal stone.
3) Small hyperechogenic focus within the gallbladder neck could
represent a small stone vs. a polyp. No evidence of
cholecystitis

BLOOD CULTURE: NGTD

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU course: Patient was admitted to the ICU for pressor support
from her persistent hypotension.  She was given Levophed
successfully through her left IJ CVL which was placed in the ED.
 She was initially treated with empiric Vancomycin/Clindamycin.
Vascular surgery was consulted and followed the patient in
house.  She did respond to these  antibiotics, but her
Clindamycin was stopped in favor of Unasyn for better GNR
coverage.  Her urine culture was negative, and her blood
cultures were NGTD on transfer from the MICU.  Moreover, given
the extensive nature of her cellulitis, dermatology was
consulted.  They felt her primary insult was likely a stasis
dermatitis.  She was thus treated with clobetasol cream and
bactroban.  LENIs was also performed and was negative for DVT.
Throughout her ICU course her cellulitis continued to improve.
Moreover, she was successfully weaned off Levophed on [**6-9**].  Her
steroids (which were started for possible adrenal insufficiency)
were quickly weaned and discontinued.
