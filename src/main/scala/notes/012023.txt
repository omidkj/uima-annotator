History of Present Illness:
77 year old woman with hx of COPD (oxygen at home), hx of
tobacco smoking, and recent suspicion of pulmonary carcinoma (no
pathologic diagnosis) who presented as a tranfer from [**Hospital3 12748**] due to tracheal compression by lung mass. The
patient noted right chest wall pain ascending from her abdomen
to her neck along with right midline back pain starting a few
months ago. She also noted increased dyspnea. Approximately 1
month ago she went for an endoscopy for being unable to clear
her oral secretions, sensation of food getting stuck, and
vomiting.  Per Mrs. [**Known lastname **], this work-up was negative. She was
hospitalized on [**6-13**] at [**Hospital6 3105**] because of a
concerning CXR and CT that showed a "shadow" in her lungs.  In
fact the CT showed 2 large mass lesions, one abutting the
trachea.  She was seen by oncology there and was not a candidate
for chemotherapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 77 year old woman with a history of COPD, and a new
diagnosis of advanced stage lung cancer (adenocarcinoma of the
lung) who presented from OSH for tracheal narrowing due to the
lung mass (adenocarcinoma). She had a bronchoscopy with silicone
Y stent placed and had an improvement in her symptoms. IP
rechecked the stent on [**2160-6-18**] and aspirated a clot. The patient
developed a small right apical pneumothorax after the procedure.
However, this quickly resolved on subsequent chest x-rays and
never caused respiratory compromise. The intra-operative biopsy
was consistent with adenocarcinoma. A CT of the head was done at
an outside hospital. The radiologists at [**Hospital1 **] performed an
additional read and stated that they were not able to
differentiate if lesions in the head were due to white matter
changes or possible metastatic disease. Hem/Onc service was
following the patient who has repeatedly stated that she would
only want palliative care.  A palliative care consult was also
done. In regards to her code, she is DNR; she would want to be
intubated only for a procedure or if it was temporary with
maximum length of intubation until the morning of the third day;
would NOT want to be intubated for a process like pneumonia;
this plan was discussed with [**Female First Name (un) 27776**] by HO on day of admission.
We continued her home dose of beta-blocker. However, we stopped
her home Lasix because of SVC compression seen on her OSH chest
CT and clinical dehydration. She has an appointment with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] at the [**Hospital6 5016**] in [**Location (un) 7661**], MA Phone:([**Telephone/Fax (1) 82960**] on Monday 10:30 AM. She may need MRI of the head and
spine at the [**Hospital6 5016**] before proceeding with
palliative radiation to rule out brain and bone metastatic
disease. She was asked to take all of her discharge papers and
[**Hospital 18**] medical records with to her appointment. She was sent home
on hospice care with pain, nausea, laxative, and respiratory
care medications.
