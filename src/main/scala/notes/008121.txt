Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea and weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15942**] is a 58 yo male w/ esophageal CA believed to be in
remission and hepatitis C who presented to the ER with dyspnea
and weakness over the last week.

Per report, patient has had a clinical decline over the last
5months with massive anasarca, ascites, weakness, and shortness
of breath. These symptoms wax and wane, but he feels they are
all at their worst at this point.  His PET scan from yesterday
revealed ascites, pleural effusions, but showed that his
esophageal CA treatment with cisplatin and 5FU was definitive.
His oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt his symptoms must be due to a
decline in his liver function in the setting of known Hepatitis
C from IV drug use.  He referred him to the [**Hospital1 **] emergency room
for admission.

His vital signs on presentation to the ER were 97.5 78 107/86 26
100.  He became hypotensive and had SBP in the 80's while in the
ER, although he was asymptomatic.  He had a CXR that showed
early PNA in the LLL for which he received levaquin. Hepatology
was consulted in the ER and believe this to be cholestatic liver
disease.  Awaiting a note for further comment and
recommendations.

His vital signs on transfer were 97.5 84/42 (78/42 prior) 62-72
13-16 98-99% RA. Upon arrival to the floor, he was tachypneic,
but mentating well and conversant

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI. +runny nose, + dry cough, + leg edema, +hemorrhoids
(-) Denies fever, chest pain or tightness.  No recent change in
bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or
myalgias.


Past Medical History:
-Esophageal CA thought to be definitively treated with
cisplastin and 5-FU
-Hepatitis C diagnosed at age 17 for which he has never been
treated or followed
-Ascites and 2 paracenteses


Social History:
Patient states he quit smoking 1 week ago, although he smells of
cigarettes.  He states that he does not currently drink or use
drugs.  He lives at home, is on disability and takes care of
himself.

Family History:
Not pertinent to his current hospitalization.

Imaging:
PET [**12-6**]
1. New enlarged gastroesophageal lymph node, 23 x 19 mm, without

FDG-avidity. 2. Persistent mild FDG-avidity within the distal
esophagus, likely post-treatment esophagitis and little changed.
3. New ascites, anasarca, and pleural effusion - possibly
related to the patient's underlying liver disease or
malnourished state, though malignant ascites cannot be excluded
and correlation should be made with the patient's pending
paracentesis cytology. 4. New and FDG-avid ground-glass opacity
in the anterior left upper lobe, SUV max 4.8, likely
inflammatory. Attention on follow-up recommended.

CXR [**12-7**]
1. Small left pleural effusion, with bibasilar atelectasis.
2. New interval left retrocardiac opacity, atelectasis is
favored however
early pneumonia cannot be excluded.

EKG [**12-7**] Normal sinus rhythm. Low voltage in the standard
leads. Q waves in leads II, III, aVF and V5-V6. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2130-9-22**]  low voltage in the standard leads
persists but it is even more prominent at this time. The pattern
of incomplete right bundle-branch block persists. The patient
has had a striking decrease in voltage in leads V4-V6 since the
previous tracing. Consider inferior and anterolateral myocardial
infarctions of undetermined age.

[**12-8**] peritoneal fluid NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

[**12-8**] paracentesis Successful ultrasound-guided paracentesis of
2.2 liters of ascitic fluid

[**12-8**] abd u/s
1. Shrunken nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis, but no
focal liver
lesion identified.
2. Splenomegaly.
3. Patent hepatic vasculature.
4. Large amount of ascites.

[**12-10**] bronchial washing
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

CTA chest [**12-10**]
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. Interval development of widespread patchy ground-glass
opacities. Given
the rapidity of onset, this most likely represents an atypical
infection or drug reaction.
3. Increased mass-like thickening of the distal esophagus
compared to the
[**Month (only) 216**] PET scan, with minimal interval increase in size of
prevascular lymph nodes and gastroesophageal lymph nodes. There
is ascites and a nodular appearance of the mesentery, which may
be due to worsening hepatic failure, but is also concerning for
carcinomatosis.
4. Stable biilateral pleural effusions.

[**12-11**] TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-8-29**], no
change

[**12-11**] abd film
Findings are consistent with colonic ileus this can
be seen in multiple etiologies including infectious (C.diff) or
inflammatory colitis or ischemia.

[**12-12**] CT abd/pelvis
1. No evidence of small or large bowel obstruction.
2. Cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly, ascites, and gastric
varices.
3. Multifocal pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions.
