Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1977**]
Chief Complaint:
Left Flank Pain, Nausea, Vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Percutaneous Nephrostomy Tube Placement ([**2103-12-8**])by IR


History of Present Illness:
73 year old woman with history of DMII and urolithiasis who had
presented from the ED on [**2103-12-8**] with complaint of L flank pain
x 2 days, with temp of 101.4; labs revealed elevated Cr to 2.7
from baseline 1.0 --> found to have L sided 7mm proximal stone
with mild hydronephrosis. BP in 90s-low 100s. Given 2L NS in ED
and Percocet then Morphine IV for pain. [**Date Range 159**] was consulted in
ED and recommended stenting in AM. On floor, patient given 1g
Ceftriaxone. At 9 PM, patient developed tachycardia and
hypotension to systolic 76; had received 300cc of 1 L NS bolus
at that time, in addition to 2L given in ED. Re-checked manually
5 mins later and systolic increased to 90s, then re-checked 5
mins later and systolics in high 80s-low 90s. Transferred to
MICU for closer monitoring, concern for early sepsis. Patient
was taken directly to IR for percutaneous nephrostomy tube prior
to MICU. On arrival, patient in mild distress secondary to pain
in left flank.
.
ROS was otherwise negative. No N/V/breathing difficulties (had
N/V 3 days PTA, which improved), no chest pain, shortness of
breath, or arthralgias.

CT PELVIS/ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W&W/O C
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are
identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. 7 x 4 mm stone seen within the left proximal ureter, with
obstruction of the left kidney.
2. Cholelithiasis.
.
MRI of abdomen:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left-sided nephrostomy catheter in place. Location of the
distal catheter is not weel assess with MRI. Edematous and
enlarged left kidney without evidence for hydronephrosis.
Obstructing stone is still visualized in the proximal UPJ.
2. No evidence for hydronephrosis or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
3. Layering gallstones seen within the gallbladder. Bilateral
layering pleural effusions.
.
Echocardiogram:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 F with DM, HTN, h/o nephrolithiasis, admitted with left
proximal ureteral stone/hydronephrosis, transferred to the MICU
for sepsis, s/p urgent left nephrostomy tube placement, with
gram negative sepsis.
.
1. GRAM NEGATIVE SEPSIS: Growing E.Coli in [**3-10**] bottles from
[**2103-12-8**]. Likely due to urinary pathogen from nephrolithiasis and
pyelonephritis (E. coli in urine). S/P nephrostomy tube
placement and drainage with purulent fluid. Received zosyn for
broad spectum until sensitivities returned and patient changed
to ciprofloxacin.  Will complete 14 day course.  She remained
afebrile on the floor.
.
2. NEPHROLITHIASIS: Patient with history of kidney stones, will
need to assess dietary intake and review prior work-up to assess
for underlying causes. S/P percutaneous nephrostomy tube
placement [**2103-12-8**] by IR. [**Month/Day/Year 159**] following and recommend [**Month/Day/Year **]
f/u as outpt in [**3-9**] weeks, once infection has clears, for
removal of nephrostomy tube and possible stent vs lithotripsy.
.
3. SVT: Developed tachycardia, found to have Aflutter and MAT on
EKG.  Difficult to control on 120 diltiazem QID so changed to
metoprolol and loaded with digoxin.  Achieved better rate
control on this regimen.  Cardiology following.  Anticoagulation
decision not clear in patient with Aflutter but MICU team
elected not to anticoagulate as patient will be having
procedures (nephrostomy tube removal, possible stent) in near
future. The patient converted to normal sinus rhythm during
admission, and was discharged on metoprolol for rate control.
.
4. DIABETES: Poorly controlled, last Hgb A1C 9.7%. Treated with
RISS, FS QID. On Lantus at home. Will need metformin restarted
at home dose of 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] once resovered.
.
5. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Likely pre-renal from dehydration from
poor PO intake and IV contrast. Creatinine slowly trended down
with fluids and time.  Urine output remained adequate.
.
6. HTN: Held BP meds in setting of hypotension, was on
amlodipine 10 and lisiniopril 40.  Was left only on metoprolol
for blood pressure control on discharge.
.
7. Dispo: In good condition, with nephrostomy tube in place,
with follow up with nephrology and primary care doctor.
