Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Aspirin / Cephalosporins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
increased lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, central line placement, arterial line placement


History of Present Illness:
74yo F with HTN, DM, CVA, CRI and hx of frequent falls s/p ORIF
[**11-30**] who presents from [**Hospital3 2558**] unresponsive and O2 sat
of 80%. She was last admitted from [**Date range (1) **] with acute on
chronic renal failure and new CHF with new systolic and
diastolic dysfunction and was started on diuretics.
.
On discussion with staff at the [**Hospital3 2558**], the pt. was in
her USOH until this AM when she was noted to be more lethargic
than usual and demonstrated oxygen saturation of 62% on 3L NC.
She wears 3L O2 at baseline. She has been afebrile. No cough.
Baseline, can answer questions and is on oxygen per nursing. Per
[**Hospital3 **] RN, her lasix dose was decreased on [**3-14**] from 120
mg po qd to 80 mg po qd.
.
Per ED signout, she presented there initially hypoxic and with a
right gaze preference, not initially moving her LUE, and a
decreased gag reflex. She was intubated for airway protection
secondary to her decreased gag and she had a head CT that showed
no acute hemorrhage but an equivocal new hypodense focus in
right parietal white matter. Urine tox screen was negative and
labs showed worsening renal failure from 3.9-->4.6. She was
given vancomycin/levofloxacin/clindamycin for a questionable
PNA? She was also given narcan and lidocaine for unclear
reasons.
.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further evaluation. Here,
she was intubated and sedated. No further history could be
obtained.
.

Social History:
No ETOH or IVDA. No smoking.

Family History:
noncontributory

Physical Exam:
97.1, 150/72, 89, 17, 100% on AC 450/16/5/100%
GEN- lying in bed intubated and sedated
HEENT- R. pupil larger than left, both reactive to light
NECK- supple

CHEST- bibasilar rales anteriorly
ABD- soft, NT/ND, +BS
EXT- + 2 pitting edema bilaterally to upper thighs
NEURO- upgoing toes bilaterally, R>L patellar reflexes, could
not assess CN exam, not withdrawing to pain stimuli while on
propofol

Pertinent Results:
PRIOR ECHO: [**2157-2-1**]- EF 40-45%, symmetric LVH, Resting regional
wall motion abnormalities include mid to distal anteroseptal and
apical akinesis/hypokinesis. 1+ MR.
.
HEAD CT-
No acute hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
Equivocal new hypodense focus in right parietal white matter.
MRI with diffusion weighted images is more sensitive in
evaluation of acute ischemia/infarct and for vascular detail.
.
CXR #1 - R. mainstem bronchus intubation, cardiomegaly,
pulmonary congestion, diffuse opacity of left lung, NG tube in
stomach
.
CXR #2 - CHF. Cannot clearly see an infiltrate on this CXR.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 75 yo F with HTN, DM, CVA, CRI who presents from her NH
with hypoxia and unresponsive and intubated in the ED for airway
protection.
.
1. Hypoxia- Most likely etiology of this hypoxia is CHF
exacerbation given the CXR and BNP >70,000. Also considered in
the differential was a pneumonia and she was covered with
vanco/levaquin.  However, she remained afebrile and with flat
wbc count so these were eventually discontinued.  She received
diuretics that initially included a lasix gtt.  Howerver, she
failed to diurese well to this and it was expanded to include
diuril.  She responded with moderate diuresis to this regimen.
A family meeting was held with the sister [**1-13**] her recent decline
in functional capacity and the decision was made to extubate the
patient and change her code status to DNR/DNI.  She tolerated
the extubation w/out event and was maintained on a high flow
mask with SpO2 in the 90s.  Her CHF regimen was maximized with
hydralazine and imdur although an ACE-I was avoided [**1-13**] her ARF.

.
2. AMS:  The patient was unresponsive with decreased gag reflex
and left UE paralysis initially.  Neurology evaluated the
patient and a CT scan showed a new hypodensity.  Neurology felt
that this could be responsible for her AMS but that it was
likely not an acute event and had happened in the recent past.
After extubation, her mental status continued to be depressed
despite adequate treatment of her CHF and infectious processes.

.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure - This was attributed to both
her UTI and her increased lasix dose.  Her FeUrea >30 which did
not suggest a prerenal etiology.  She was treated for her
proteus UTI with ceftriaxone and continued to be diuresed as
above.  Her creatinine initially trended towards normal but rose
again just prior to discharge likely due to more aggressive
diuresis in the setting of her active CHF.
.
4. UTI - Treated with with ciprofloxacin initially but this was
changed to CTX once culture sensitivities became available.
.
4. HTN - Her BP was treated w/ hydral/imdur as above.
.
5. DM - She was followed with finger sticks and covered with an
ISS.
.
6. Code status - As mentioned previously, the patient was
initially full code and was intubated for respiratory
protection.  Discussion with her sister (and HCP) led to her
being extubated and her code status being changed to DNR/DNI.
At the time of discharge, the current plan of care was to make
her comfortable and continue to treat her underlying CHF/UTI
with oral meds if the patient was able to take them.  The HCP
wished to avoid any procedures that would cause her pain such as
central line placement, NGT placement, or the initiation of
pressors.
