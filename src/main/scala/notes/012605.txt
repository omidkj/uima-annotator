Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
Cut left foot, tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
64yo M with PMHx of DM, HTN, HLd, and schizophrenia presented to
the ED after falling while trying to get on a bus and sustained
a skin tear to the right foot. The patient did have a head
strike. Patient denies loss of consciousness, vomiting, and
focal neurologic deficits. No neck pain. Denies chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, palpitations. He denies cough and
sputum production. Reports he is feeling well otherwise.

In the ED, patient was triggered for HR in 140s. He was afebrile
and all other VS were stable. Patient had a chest CXR done that
showed patchy opacities in the lung bases for which the
differential includes atelectasis, infection, or aspiration. No
large pleural effusion or pneumothorax were present. The patient
was persistently tachycardic to 130s. Boluesed with 4L NS, but
tachycardia was unresponsive to IVF and electrolyte repletion.
Given banana bag, folate, thiamine, MVI.  Given opacity in the
lung, patient was started on Vanc/Levaquin + nebulizer and
solumedrol.

When the patient arrived to the unit, he had no complaints
except for being tired. He denies CP, SOB, N/V, abdominal pain,
palpitations.

Pertinent Results:
Microbiology:

Imaging:
[**2102-8-21**] Head CT:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema or
mass effect.
Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. There
is no
evidence of fracture. There is a subgaleal hematoma at the left
parietal
vertex. There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air
cells and in the right frontal sinus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial injury. Left
parietal
subgaleal hematoma without associated fracture.

[**2102-8-21**] CXR:
PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The heart size is mildly
enlarged. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There are
patchy opacities
in the lung bases for which the differential includes
atelectasis, infection,
or aspiration. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
present.
IMPRESSION: Patchy opacities at the lung bases, which may
represent
atelectasis, infection, or aspiration.

[**2102-8-24**] CXR:
FINDINGS: The right lower lobe opacities have shown an interval
minimal
progression since [**2102-8-21**]. linear atelectasis in the left
mid lung is new since [**2102-8-21**]. There is increased
retrocardiac density suggestive of a left lower lobe volume
loss. Pleural effusions if any bilaterally are minimal. Cardiac
size is mildly enlarged and unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Increased right lower lobe opacity and stable
opacities in the
left lung base since [**2102-8-21**]. These may reflect either an
infection and/or atelectasis.  Left mid lung linear atelectasis,
which is new since [**2102-8-21**].
.
CTA-IMPRESSION:
1. Emphysema.
2. Bibasilar opacities at the lung bases and in the lingula,
could be
atelectasis, cannot exclude pneumonia.
3. Suboptimal bolus for pulmonary embolus and motion in the
scanner.
However, no large pulmonary embolus. Subsegmental evaluation is
suboptimal.
4. Prominent lymph nodes in the mediastinum, nonspecific, could
be reactive.
5. T10 small sclerotic focus in the vertebral body. Consider
bone scan for
further evaluation to exclude secondary deposit. D/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]

6. Small renal hypodensities, too small to be characterized.
7. No fracture.
