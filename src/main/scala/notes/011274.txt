History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. female with hx 3VD (99% LAD, 90% LCx, 100% RCA cath in
[**2128**]), refused CABG/repeat caths in the past, h/o NSTEMI [**9-11**],
CHF (echo [**3-15**] EF 15-20%, 3+ MR, mild AR), who was recently
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for CHF exacerbation, disuresed and discharged
[**2132-4-18**].  The patient with h/o multiple admittions for
respiratory
distress/failure in last couple of months. Precipitating factors
for her repeated CHF exacerbations are not clear. Patient denies
medication non-compliance or dietary indiscretions.  This
episode, she has been experiencing SOB X 24 hours and sent from
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab for diuresis.  No CP, palpitations, fevers, chills,
dysuria, cough or belly pain/diarrhea.

In the [**Name (NI) **], pt given short course of ntg gtt which dropped
pressures, requiring low-dose dop gtt.  Became more SOB, so
BiPAP was started.  Lasix 40 PO and 80 IV given with little
diuresis.  Pt's BP then decreased to SBP ~50's for ~30 sec and
dop gtt titrated to max.  Pt then became tachycardic, developed
QRS prolongation and again dropped pressures to 70's.  She was
mentating throughout the episode.  Dop gtt stopped and 250 NS
given.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with severe ischemic CMP s/p numerous
hospitalizations for decompensated HF requiring intubation now
p/w hypotension, CHF and acidosis.

1.  Hypotension:  Likely multifactorial, but ntg gtt in ER could
have contributed.  She went on a dop gtt in the ED, then went
into sustained stable VT.  Therefore, her dop gtt was d/c'd and
she was started on levophed, which she required for approx 5
hours.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test, TSD and [**Last Name (un) **] cultures were all neg, so
unlikely distributive shock.  She became normotensive then
hypertensive by time of discharge and was discharged with her
outpt antihypertensive regimen.

2.  CHF Exac:  Unclear precipitating factors.  Has evidence of
mainly L-sided HF now.  She was diuresed with IV lasix and was
neg 1.5L for the length of stay.  She was discharged with oupt
lasix dose.

3.  Met Acidosis:  Initial gas  7.19/37/79 on 10L NC.  She had a
metabolic acidosis with insufficient resp compensation, likely
[**3-12**] pul edema.  Her met acidosis was non-gap, with a urine anion
gap of -15, indicating non-renal loss of mineral acid.  However,
she had no evidence of diarrhea.  We attributed this to acute
renal failure.  By time of discharge her serum bicarb was still
slightly low at 17, however she was not re-gas'd since she
appeared comfortable and clinically markedly improved.

4.  Renal Failure:  U lytes revealed FE urea of 7%; markedly
pre-renal, likely from forward heart failure.  Renal function
improved to baseline with diuresis.

5.  Rhythym:  Pt went into stable monomorphic VT in ED while on
dopamine gtt at 20.  She was mentating during this episode and
did not require shock.  Rather, she reverted to sinus with
discontinuation of the dopamine gtt.  She was not treated with
any anti-arrythmic therapy as the VT was [**3-12**] beta-agonism [**3-12**]
dopamine.  She will be discharged with her home dose of BB.

6.  CAD:  Continued asa/ticlopidine/statin.  CP free.  No
evidence of ACS.  CE's neg.

7.  DM:  RISS.
