Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40962**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] elective cardiac catheterization for a
positive stress test and was found to have severe left main
coronary artery disease.  He had an IABP placed after he had
chest pain post-cath.  His aortic valve was also evaluated
during cath, and he was found to have mild to moderate aortic
stenosis.  He was admitted to the CCU to await CABG-AVR.  He
remained chest pain-free for the rest of his stay in the CCU.
He was maintained on ASA and a high-dose statin.  He was also
put on a beta blocker that was titrated up for better
perioperative beta blockade.  He was also put on IV heparin for
his IABP.  He had a carotid US that showed less than 40%
stenosis of his internal carotid arteries bilaterally.  He was
scheduled to go to the OR on [**5-1**] for CABG-AVR.  However, he
began to develop a hematoma in the area of his left forearm
laceration in the early morning before his scheduled surgery.
He had severe pain in his arm and hand, and there was concern
for evolving compartment syndrome.  His IV heparin was
discontinued and Plastic Surgery was called for evaluation.
They removed the stitches on his forearm to allow drainage of
the hematoma.  However, it continued to expand and the decision
was made to take him for urgent fasciotomy to prevent
compartment syndrome.  As he would be receiving large amounts of
IV heparin on bypass, Cardiac Surgery decided to postpone his
CABG-AVR until the fasciotomy was performed and his wound was
stable.  He was taken for fasciotomy the morning of [**5-1**].  He was
kept on IV Ancef postoperatively.

On [**5-3**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed two vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting and an aortic valve replacment with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
mechanical valve. For further surgical details, please see
seperate dictated op note. Following the operation, he was
brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. The IABP was
weaned and removed without complication. He initially required
epicardial pacing for complete heart block. The EP service was
consulted for potential pacemaker. Over several days, his native
heart rate improved and complete heart block resolved. Pacemaker
was therefore not indicated and Warfarin anticoagulation was
initiated. On postoperative day three, he transferred to the
SDU. He transiently required Heparin for a subtherapeutic INR.
Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0. Low dose
beta blockade was intitated and advanced as tolerated. He
remained in a normal sinus rhythm with no further episodes of
heart block. Over several additional days, he made steady
progress with physical therapy and continued to make clinical
improvements with diuresis. The Plastic surgery team continued
to follow his wound, which remained stable. He was cleared for
discharge to home on postoperative six. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will monitor
his Warfarin as an outpatient. He will also need to follow up
with Plastic surgery as directed. His postop cardiac follow up
appointment will be arranged in approximately 4 weeks.
