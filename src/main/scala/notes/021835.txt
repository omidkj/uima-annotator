History of Present Illness:
CC: 74-year-old male patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 120**] and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 9193**] [**Name (STitle) 9194**] with a history of mitral regurgitation who is
scheduled for repair of the valve on [**2116-8-14**] with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], referred for a right and left heart catheterization
followed by surgical repair of his mitral valve.

HPI: This is a 74-year-old male with a history of [**Last Name (STitle) 9195**]
and hypertension who has been routinely followed by cardiology
for mitral regurgitation.  He has regular surveillance
echocardiograms and has been generally asymptomatic over the
past twenty years since diagnosis.

On [**2116-7-21**] he had his routine yearly echocardiogram.  He
was found to have an increase in his pulmonary artery pressure
to 38 mm Hg. Previous echocardiograms have the PA pressures
between 24-27 mmHg.  The report also found mitral valve prolapse
with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation.   He had preserved
biventricular size and systolic function.  His LVEF was > 55%.

In terms of symptoms Mr. [**Known lastname 9196**] reports an increase in
exertional dyspnea over the past two years ago.  At times he
develops chest pressure when he walks up more than one flight of
stairs quickly.  He also has occasional dyspnea associated with
the chest pressure.  He is able to exercise on his treadmill
about 15 minutes each day doing about ?????? a mile.  In addition he
reports occasional bilateral ankle edema.

Of note this gentleman had a stress echo on [**2114-5-16**].  He was
able to exercise 12 minutes 15 seconds on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol to a
maximum heart rate of 109 representing 73% of his age predicted
maximum heart rate.   He was noted to have 0.5-1mm ST segment
depression in the inferolateral leads which resolved with 2
minutes of rest.  He experienced no chest discomfort, shortness
of breath or dyspnea.  The echocardiogram showed severe mitral
regurgitation but pulmonary artery pressure was normal.  LVEF
was > 55%.

[**2116-8-13**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed no angiographically apparent obstructive coronary
artery
disease.  The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA were without
angiographically
apparent flow-limiting stenoses.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling
pressures with LVEDP of 28 mm Hg.  There was mild pulmonary
arterial
hypertension with PA systolic pressure of 33 mm Hg.  The cardiac
index
was preserved at 3.3 l/min/m2. There was systemic arterial
hypertension
with aortic pressure of 181/79 mm Hg.  There was no evidence of
mitral
stenosis on simultaneous measurements of LVEDP and PCWP.  There
was no
transaortic valve gradient upon pullback of the catheter from LV
to
aorta.
3.  Left ventriculography was deferred.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9196**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2116-8-13**] for surgical
management of his mitral valve disease. He underwent a cardiac
catheterization which revealed no coronary artery disease and
severe mitral regurgitation. He was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner. On [**2116-8-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname 9196**] was taken to the
opertaing room where he underwent a mitral valve repair using a
28mm annuloplast ring. Please see operative note for details. Of
note, a foley catheter was attempted preoperatively but could
not be passed. Given his history of [**Known lastname **] cancer and
prostatectomy, the urology service was consulted. A catheter was
placed using a flexible cystoscopy and dilation was performed of
a tight bladder neck contraction. Gentamycin and ciprofloxacin
were given for coverage. It was recommended that the foley
remain in place until ready for discharge and that he follow-up
with his urologist as an outpatient. Postoperatively he was
taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. On
postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 9196**] had awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. Beta blockade and aspirin were
resumed. He developed atrial fibrillation for which amiodarone
was started with good rate control. On postoperative day two, he
was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. Mr.
[**Known lastname 9196**] was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight.
The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with
his postoperative strength and mobility.

He developed a right pneumothorax after chest tube removal which
required the placement of a chest tube on [**2116-8-18**]. The
pneumothorax improved and the chest tube was removed with a
small right apical pneumothorax remaining. ACE inhibitor
restarted on [**8-20**] and he remained in sinus rhythm. Cleared for
discharge to home on POD #6 with instructions for CXR and wound
check in 1 week. Pt. is to follow up with outpt. urologist if
any GU symptoms develop and make all appts. as instructed.
