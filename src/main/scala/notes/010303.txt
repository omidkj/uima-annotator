q one hour, was transferred to Medicine service [**2111-10-19**] after
neurologic status was stable.  Continued monitoring
neurologic status with neurologic checks q 4 to 8.  On [**10-20**]

appointments [**11-2**] at 1 P.M. with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital Unit Name 36814**] for head CT to be completed by
[**10-30**].

#2:  Cardiovascular.  Patient has chronic paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, not a good candidate for anticoagulation given
subdural hematoma and fall risk.  Patient to have cardiology
follow up in Martha' [**Location (un) **] to be arranged by primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 15985**].  Patient

Digoxin level was .06.  Recommend having Digoxin level
checked one week.  Echocardiogram [**10-22**].  Last echocardiogram
normal sinus rhythm, rate of 85, diffuse ST abnormalities
nonspecific.  Echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of
greater than 60, atrium not dilated and no evidence of left
ventricular hypertrophy, no thrombi, valves are normal.
Mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened, moderate pulmonary artery,
systolic hypertension and significant prolonged regurgitation
is seen.

#3:  Infectious Disease.  Patient had urinalysis with white
blood cells of 47.  Physical examination revealed crackles at
base of lower lungs bilateral.  Chest x-ray ordered revealed
extensive collapse and consolidation of basal left lower lobe
compared to [**10-16**].  Bilateral pleural effusions evident with
slight left ventricular enlargements.  No vascular
congestion.  Patient give Levsin 500 mg q.d., is currently on
day 3.

#4:  Electrolytes.  Patient had depleted electrolytes,
potassium, magnesium.  Patient give Nutraphos times three.
[**10-20**] potassium level 3.4.  [**10-22**] potassium level 4.0.
Magnesium level 1.3 on [**10-15**] 1.4.  Patient given two
grams magnesium sulfate intravenous.  Recommend checking
magnesium and potassium level one week.  Laboratory values -
CPK enzymes, CPK [**10-20**] decreased to 299 from original on
admission of 2,002, CK MB [**10-20**] read 7 as opposed to admission
level 3.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DIAGNOSIS ON DISCHARGE:
1.      Subdural hematoma.
2.      Atrial fibrillation.
3.      Mental status change.
4.      Pneumonia.
5.      Urinary tract infection.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Lisinopril 15 mg p.o. q.d.,
Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d., Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol
XL 150 mg p.o. q.d.

PLAN:  Patient to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], check Digoxin
level in one week, also potassium and magnesium level in one
week, CT of head by [**10-30**], hold aspirin two weeks or
until seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Follow up appointment through his
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Follow up appointment through
