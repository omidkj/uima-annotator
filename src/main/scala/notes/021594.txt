Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
sudden onset of L arm and leg weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation at OSH on [**7-15**] for concern of airway protection

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old right-handed woman with a history of
HTN, HLD, hypothyroidism and remote hx of lupus who presents
with
an episode of dizziness on [**7-15**], found to have a L cerebellar
infarct, now with acute onset of face arm and leg weakness.
According to her family and [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] notes, for much of
last
week the patient seemed much sleepier than usual, and spent a
significant amount of time in bed.  She was napping all day on
[**7-15**], and when she awoke from her nap at 5pm, she was
complaining
of dizziness, and was also noted to be slurring her speech.  By
some reports she also had a cold sweat and was complaining of
being too weak to walk.  She was taken to [**Hospital3 **],
where
she was admitted and underwent evaluation for possible stroke.
Exam initially was only notable for end gaze nystagmus, and
slight ataxia.  She had an MRI that day, which showed a new left
cerebellar infarct.  MRA at that time had a significant amount
of
artifact, but no obvious intracranial abnormalities.  On [**7-17**],
she
was just finishing lunch at 1pm when she was noted to have
sudden
onset of left facial droop, and left arm and leg weakness.
Neurology was called again, and she was found to have an NIHSS
of
7.  Discussion was had with the family about the possibility of
tPA, however given her known subacute cerebellar infarct, the
decision was made not to give tPA.  She was intubated at that
time for airway protection, as she was noted to be choking on
her
saliva, and arrangements were made to transfer her to [**Hospital1 18**]

MRI/MRA brain:
FINDINGS: When compared to the [**2101-7-16**] MRI, there has been
interval
development of numerous acute infarcts. The largest is in the
right posterior
cerebral artery territory involving the inferomedial right
temporal lobe. A
second new acute infarct involves the lateral aspect, right
thalamus. Other
new small foci of restricted diffusion within the right
cerebellar hemisphere,
posterior left cerebellar hemisphere, medial left temporal lobe,
and inferior
right occipital lobe are also new compared to [**2101-7-16**]. These
infracts show
mildly increased signal on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences.

There has been expected maturation of the now subacute left PICA
territorial
infarct within the inferomedial left cerebellar hemisphere. On
DWI, this
infarct shows "pseudonormalization," centrally, with slight
interval increase
in signal on ADC map. More peripherally, the infarct maintains
low signal on
ADC map. This infarct also remains hyperintense on DWI, FLAIR,
and
T2-weighted images. This infarct shows increased FLAIR- and
T2-hyperintensity
when compared to the more recent infarcts. There is also more
vasogenic edema
within this infarct with loss of normal gyri and sulci.

None of these infarcts show loss of signal on
susceptibility-weighted images
to suggest hemorrhage.

The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci otherwise show symmetric,
age-related
prominence.

Underlying sequelae of chronic microvascular disease are similar
to the prior
MRI with subcortical, centra semiovale, and periventricular
hyperintensity on
FLAIR and T2-weighted images.

The patient is status post bilateral lens surgery. A
mucus-retention cyst
within the right maxillary sinus, a right mastoid effusion, and
fluid within
the aerated left petrous apex are all unchanged since prior
examinations.

A small focus of susceptibility artifact within the posterior
left frontal
lobe subcortical white matter likely corresponds to a small
hyperintense focus
seen on the [**2098**] CT and may represent a small calcification.

MRA HEAD: The time-of-flight MRI of the head is limited by
motion artifact.
Within this limitation, and correlating with the contrast
enhanced MRA of the
neck which extedned to the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**], there is no
significant luminal
irregularity and no flow- limiting stenosis. The left vertebral
artery is
dominant. The basilar artery is mildly tortuous. The P1 segments
have normal
caliber bilaterally. No posterior communicating arteries are
identified.

The intracranial internal carotid arteries show no apparent
flow-limiting
stenosis. The right A1 segment is dominant, supplying the
majority of the
left and right A2 segments. A small, likely hypoplastic A1
segment is patent.
The anterior communicating artery is not well seen. There is
normal symmetric
arborization of the middle cerebral arteries bilaterally.

There is no intracranial aneurysm.

MRA NECK: Contrast-enhanced MRA of the neck reveals no
significant luminal
irregularity and no flow-limiting stenosis. Apparent mild
narrowing of the
left vertebral artery may be artifactual, or may represent mild
stenosis. The
dominant left vertebral artery has otherwise normal course and
caliber. The
right vertebral artery has normal course and caliber.
Bilaterally, the common,
proximal external and cervical internal carotid arteries have
normal course
and caliber.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval (compared to [**2101-7-16**] MRI) development of numerous
acute
infarcts involving multiple vascular territories, suspicious for

central/embolic infarcts.
2. Interval expected maturation of the left PICA territory
infarct.
3. No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.


Brief Hospital Course:
ICU course: the patient was admitted to the ICU, after having
been intubated at an outside hospital after concern that she was
choking on her sailva. Her exam on admission was notable for a R
eye abducens palsy and L arm and leg paresis that improved
during her stay in the ICU. She was extubated without difficulty
on her 2nd day. Blood pressure was stable in the 110-130s
systolic with one episode of hypotension to the 90s likely
secondary to propofol. After extubation patient was interacting
wit
