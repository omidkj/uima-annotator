History of Present Illness:
77 yo female with PMH CAD, DM, HTN presented to OSH on [**7-23**] with
hematemsis. Pt was taking Aleve for HA x 2 weeks. Found to be
hypotensive at 80/50 with Hct of 25.6. Pt was transferred to ICU
and resuscitated with IVF and PRBCs, with increased in Hct to
34.5. In setting of GIB, developed acute MI (likely NSTEMI from
demand ischemia, however, has STE on EKG in antero-lateral
leads). Pt only sx were fatigue; denied any CP, arm, jaw pain.
Tn I peaked at 18 on [**7-24**]. Echo on [**7-24**] revealed EF 35-40%;
akinetic mid anterior, apical septal, apical anterior, apical
lateral, apical inferior and apical wall segments. Tn decreased
then bumped up to 14 on [**7-26**]. Tn has been decreasing since then,
last value of 6. Pt was medically managed with Lopressor, no
aspirin. Given nitro and IV lopressor for HR/BP control given
NPO status. On [**7-26**], pt had more hematemesis and decrease in hct
to 28.5. EGD was performed which showed retained blood and blood
clots in stomach with an ulcer which was cauterized. Pt was
intermittently on Nexium drip, transferred on this. Hct has
remained stable at 31 since 2pm [**7-26**]. Pt has not had any further
episodes of hematesis. Continues to pass liquid maroon stool. Pt
received a total of 6 U of PRBC; last given on [**7-27**] AM. Pt
remains asymptomatic from cardiac standpoint. Of note, pt was
noted to have ARF with creatinine up to 1.8, now decreased to
1.2.

Cardiac catheterization ([**2118-7-27**]): Selective coronary
angiography of this right dominant system reveals severe two
vessel disease.  The left main coronary artery is widely patent.
 The LAD has 80% proximal calcific disease- the mid LAD is
totally occluded after D1 takeoff.  The left circumflex artery
has only mild luminal irregularities.  The RCA has ostial 99.9%
stenosis with collaterals filling relatively undiseased PDA and
[**Name (NI) **]. Resting hemodyanmic measurment (see above) demonstrates
elevated
right and left side filling pressures with a normal cardiac
output.
.
Echocardiogram ([**2118-7-28**]): The LA is normal in size. There is
mild symmetric LVH. The LV cavity size is normal. Overall LV
systolic function is moderately-to-severely depressed (EF 30%)
secondary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum and
anterior free wall, with apical dyskinesis. Tissue velocity
imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased LV filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an
e' of <0.08m/s c/w an elevated LV filling pressure (>12mmHg). RV
chamber size is normal. There is focal hypokinesis of the apical
free wall of the RV. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
Myocardial infarction: The patient was transferred from an
outside hospital for management of a presumed anterolateral MI,
evidenced by persistent ST elevations in the precordial leads.
Her creatinine kinase (CK) peaked at 222 and decreased steadily
of the course of hospitalization.  She undewent coronary
catheterization on [**7-28**], which revealed an 80% proximal calcific
disease in the LAD and total occlusion of the mid-LAD.  The
right coronary artery had ostial 99.9% stenosis with collaterals
filling her coronary domains distal to that. Her calcific
lesions in both the LAD and RCA could not be passed during the
catheterization, and no stents could be placed. Her MI was then
medically treated with increases in her beta-blocker (toprol 150
PO QD), statin (atorvastatin 80 mg PO qd), and ACE (lisinopril
10 mg). She was placed on aspirin at a dose of 162 mg PO qd due
to concern for her past medical history of GI bleeding. She had
an echo to assess heart function, and her EF was found to be
35-40%. She was started on furosemide 40 mg qd, and her
outpatient diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide, was discontinued. Her
antihypertensive clonidine was also discontinued to allow for
the increase in her beta-blocker dose. Her discharge medications
provided adequate BP control while in the hospital. As
follow-up, the patient will need a viability assessment of
myocardium with MR, which has been scheduled 5 days from
discharge. She was also scheduled for follow-up with a
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GI bleed was caused by
a gastric ulcer, as determined on endoscopy at the outside
hospital she was transferred from. The ulcer probably formed in
the setting of NSAID use and H.pylori infection. The patient's
H.pylori antibody test performed here was positive. She was
started on 14-day triple therapy with clarithromycin 250 mg PO
bid, amoxicillin 1 gm PO bid and pantoprazole 40 mg PO bid. On
discharge she the amoxicillin was substituted with
dicloxacillin, which was being taken for an unrelated infection.
*
Cellulitis: On admission, the patient had cellulitic appearing
left forearm lesions apparently from attemtped phlebotomy at
OSH. She developed two small abscesses that were drained by
surgery at the bedside, and subsequently a venectomy was also
performed by the surgery team on her left arm. Her arm was then
elevated with twice a day dressing changes. Her cellulitis
cultured positive for Staph aureus bacteria, which was sensitive
to nafcillin.  She was discharged on a ten day course of oral
dicloxacillin and has a follow-up appointment scheduled Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6633**], a surgeon who supervised her in-house care.
.
Diabetes: The patient's blood glucose control was managed with
her outpatient doses of oral hypoglycemics and sliding scale
insulin.
