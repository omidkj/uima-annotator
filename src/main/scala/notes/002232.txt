none


History of Present Illness:
44yo M PMHx significant for Lupus, ESRD on HD
(Tues/Thurs/Saturday) awaiting renal transplant, CHF w severe
mitral regurgitation and pHTN, HTN, GERD who initially presented
to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with 1 week of SOB and chest pain, workup
significant for flat cardiac enzymes, unremarkable CXR, BNP of
773; patient reports that over the last year, he has had
recurrent episodes of these symptoms that have been attributed
to his mitral valve disease. Review of his [**Location (un) 2274**] notes confirm
this (stays on [**11-2**]), and describe chronic worsening of
his dyspnea on exertion. Workup in the past has included TTE (EF
55-60%, moderate-severe AI, severe posteriorly-directed MR, and
severe pulmonary HTN), Chest CT (c/w interstitial lung disease).
On his admission to OSH, there was concern for need for MVR
workup. Patient now transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On arrival, he reported some stable shortness of breath. He
described his symptoms as the sensation that he was not getting
enough air. He reported that his symptoms would often improve
with morphine. He denied any associated chest pain, productive
cough, headache, dizziness.

.
ECHO [**10-15**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with probable thinning and hypokinesis of the basal
inferior segment. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**11-28**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity
may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: the basal inferior wall is probably hypokinetic.
There is moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Mild to
moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
.
CXR [**10-15**]:
 FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low. There is moderate
cardiomegaly with mildpulmonary edema. In addition, relatively
extensive bilateral areas of
opacities are seen that could be atelectatic, but could also
represent
pneumonia. These opacities are more severe on the right than on
the left. Nopleural effusions. A double-lumen left-sided central
venous access line.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Shortness of Breath - Patient w chronic worsening of shortness
of breath, thought to be [**12-29**] mitral regurgitation; patient
denying any chest pain. R/O'd at [**Hospital 1474**] hospital. EKG not
consistent with ischemic origin; no signs to suggest infection
on history, imaging, labs; does not appear to be acute worsening
of MR, but more slow progression. Ground glass appearance on
chest CT and bilat pleural effusions may be suggestive of
interstitial lung disease and may be somewhat responsible for
DOE. Also, pt has hx of OSA and not currently using CPAP which
may be causing moderate pulmonary hypertension seen on ECHO.
Cardiac surgery saw pt today and recommeneded further testing
via cardiac catheterization and TEE to better evaluate valve.
PCP also [**Name (NI) 653**] by [**Name (NI) 2274**] cardiologist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 2920**] to arrange
pulmonary f/u appt to assess above pulmonary issues. Pt was
walked on day of discharge and displayed no DOE with O2 sats in
high 90's.
.
#H/O graft thrombus: pt was not being followed by PCP or
[**Hospital3 **] since moving from [**Hospital1 1474**] to [**Hospital1 392**]. He
states he has been taking warfarin 5 mg regularly (a dose that
he was therapeutic on previously). Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2920**] has [**First Name (STitle) 653**] PCP to
[**Name9 (PRE) 107265**] [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u with [**Hospital 2274**] [**Hospital3 **] after discharge.
INR 1.6 on discharge, 5 mg dose was continued.
.
# GERD: no issues, will cont PPI [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Lupus: pt states he is in a flare but able to ambulate with a
cane and no increase in pain medicines needed. He has a
rheumatologist in [**Hospital1 1474**] where he previously lives who told
him to increase prednisone to 20 mg with a taper down to 5 mg
over one week. Apparently, pt has a soft diagnosis of lupus per
[**Location (un) 2274**] notes. No changes were make in his medicines (including
oxycodone) and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will arrange rheumatology through
[**Location (un) 2274**].
.
# ESRD on HD: Scheduled Tues/Thurs/Sat. Rec'd HD today without
incident and removed 2L total. Appears euvolemic on exam.
Unclear if more aggressive fluid removal in HD has helped his
SOB.
.
# HTN: BP well controlled at present on atenolol. No ACE on
admission.
.
# Insomnia / Anxiety; Trazadone and lorazepam were continued at
home doses.
.
Transitional issues:
1. Pt was counseled to continue care at [**Location (un) 2274**] and seek referrals
for rheumatology and pulmonology within that system. AS he is a
young complicated pt, he would benefit from an integrated health
care system.
2. PCP will arrange [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u in [**Hospital3 **] for INR
monitoring.
3. PCP will arrange [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u with pulmonology to evaluate sleep apnea
and pulmonary hypertension
4. Cardiac surgery will arrange cardiac catheterization and TEE
as an outpt in preparation for MVR.

Medications on Admission:
- Chloroquine 250mg daily
- Albuterol / ipratropium inhaler
