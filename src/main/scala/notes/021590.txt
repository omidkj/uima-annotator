History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo M from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab baseline Alert and
Orientedx3 , h/o Parkinson's s/p trach, multiple aspiration
events, HTN who was having BM today at Rehab, became cyanotic,
pulseless and recieved chest compressions. He was never shocked
or given meds but had return of spontaneous circulation at
rehab. On arrival to the ED, he was put on vent for poor resp
effort. Was making non-purposeful spont mvmts. EKG showed sinus
bradycardia. Labs were unremarkable with a lactate of 2.0. Prior
to leaving the ED, he is following commands, communicating with
his wife by motioning. He is complaining of pain in ribs. Also
in the ED, CT head preliminarily read as not acute intracranial
process, CXR with RUL and RML infiltrates c/w aspiration. He was
hemodynamically stable and cooling protocol was not initiated as
he was neurologically improving. No meds were given in ED except
for 1L NS.

On arrival to the ICU, we was responding to commands and c/o
left sided rib pain.

Review of systems: Pt unable to answer extensive ROS at this
time.

Imaging:

Head CT ([**4-13**]):
No acute intracranial process.

Echo ([**4-14**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. RV with
normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2142-4-25**], no definite change.

CTA chest ([**4-14**]):
1)No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2)Bibasilar atelectasis and secretions in the lower lobes
bilaterally could be due to aspiration.
3)Multifocal consolidation in the lower lobes and left upper
lobe to a lesser extent is most likely pneumonia.
4)Small right pneumothorax with pigtail catheter in situ.
5)Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes in addition to granulomas in
the liver and spleen are most likely due to prior granulomatous
exposure.

Abd/pelvis CT ([**4-16**]):
1. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
2. No complications of [**Month/Year (2) 282**] placement are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary: [**Age over 90 **]yo M from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab baseline Alert and Orientedx3
, h/o Parkinson's s/p trach, multiple aspiration events, HTN who
was having BM at Rehab, became cyanotic, pulseless and recieved
chest compressions.

# Shock: The patient required dopa infusion at the beginning of
his hospital stay. No organisms grew in his blood, however, he
did have a multifocal pneumonia. A subclavian line was placed
for better access and hemodynamic monitoring. The patient was
noted to have a low CVP so he was given intermittent boluses of
normal saline. In addition, he was continued on antibiotics for
some component of septic shock, though he never had high
lactates.

# Respiratory failure with multifocal ventilator associated
pneumonia: The patient has a tracheostomy at baseline and uses
ventilator support at night. The patient was noted to have
increased secretions, increased needs on his ventilator,
infiltrates in the RML/RUL and a trach cuff [**Hospital 3564**]. He was
empirically started on vancomycin and cefepime for treatment of
pneumonia. A bronchoscopy was done to clear the secretions and
grew a resistant form of pseudomonas. Despite therapy with
cefepime, the patient still continued to grow pseudomonas in his
sputum. Tobramycin nebulizers were added to his regimen [**4-16**].
Despite the use of these antibiotics, the patient still required
higher assisted control ventilation. In addition, he had a trach
cuff [**Last Name (LF) 3564**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] his trach was switched and the [**First Name3 (LF) 3564**] resolved. The
patient should continue Cefepime until [**2145-4-27**], and the [**Female First Name (un) **]
nebs should continue for at least another week afterwards
(~[**2145-5-4**]). Pt also with a component of fluid overload, as he
received IVF on initial resuscitation. Diuresin
