Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old with h/o pancreatic adenocarcinoma s/p Whipple
[**1-/2159**], a. fib on warfarin, LV systolic dysfunction with LVEF
25-30%, and Type II DM who p/w syncope and concern for GI
hemorrhage.
.
# Pre-syncope: Patient describes a self limiting episode of
lightheadedness with reported periorbital cyanosis. Initial
differential included venous thromboembolism, orthostasis,
autonomic dysfunction, anemia, hypoxia, and myocardial ischemia.
 History is not consistent with seizure activity as no focal
deficits, no involuntary movements, no loss of consciousness, no
loss of bowel or bladder function. Given modified [**Doctor Last Name 3012**] criteria
score of 4, patient underwent CTA chest which showed no evidence
of pulmonary embolism but did reveal large bilateral non
hemorrhagic effusions.  He was monitored on telemetry overnight
without events. Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated (peak Trop
0.11) though medical record reveals recent troponins that were
as high as 0.21. EKG was without ischemic changes.  Patient
hematocrit was 24.8 on presentation which was slightly below
recent baseline of 27. He was transfused 1 Unit of PRBCs. GI
performed [**Doctor Last Name **], which showed an ulcer at the anastomosis.
Biopsies were performed and were sent for H.pylori and CMV. The
patient had no further episodes of bleeding. Coumadin was held
and patient was encouraged to make a PCP appointment to discuss
restarting this medication. Protonix was started at 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
The patient may need a repeat [**Hospital1 **] as an outpatient to be sure
the ulcer is healing and also because the entire stomach was not
visualized on [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Iron deficiency anemia: Patient presents with hematocrit of
24.8 with recent hematocrits near 27. Patient had guaiac
positive brown stool at the outside hospital. NG lavage was
negative for blood. He was transfused 1 unit pRBC and given 2 L
IV NS. He was admitted to the MICU for monitoring where he
remained hemodynamically stable overnight. He denied recent
nausea, vomiting, or bloody stool.  He does admit to a history
of intermittent black stools since his Whipple surgery in [**1-31**].
GI team was consulted who recommended [**Date Range **], with findings as
above.
