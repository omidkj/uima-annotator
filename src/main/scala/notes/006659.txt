History of Present Illness:
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
75 year old male with a history of IDDM, HTN and CKD with recent
admission for LLE cellulitis treated with Augmentin (he has 4
days left on this course) who was seen in clinic for malaise and
admitted based on his laboratory results (Na of 129, anemia with
HCT of 29.4 and acute renal failure with Cr of 3.2 from baseline
of 2.0).
.
In the ED, vitals were: T:97.8, HR:102, BP:129/109, RR:20,
O2Sat:95% on RA. He was found to have a UTI and was given
Unasyn. He was given 2L normal saline for his sodium of 126 and
admitted to night float.
.
The patient reports he was in his usual state of health which
includes walking daily until Friday when he awoke from his nap
and experienced shaking chills and whole chest, back and
shoulder pain "in the muscles". He states that this improved
after he was wrapped in several blankets. Then Saturday at 2 am,
he awoke to check his blood glucose and noted whole chest, arm
and back pain. He was unable to clarify this pain further other
than to say it was unbearable. He states it was worse with
movement, lying flat, and deep inspiration. He took tylenol and
it resolved. He reports generalized fatigue, and decreased
appetite. He developed nausea on monday prior to admission, and
the day before admission felt unwell and saw his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] clinic
he was felt to have a viral syndrome and was sent home with
precautions. He recalled and admitted for lab abnormalities as
above.
.
On morning assessment the patient was found to be in atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate up to 150, hypotensive
down to systolic 70s, temp 99.9, and respiratory distress 93% on
4LNC. The patient also endorsed pleuritic chest pain, similar to
the pain he had no the saturday prior to admission. Due to his
clinical deterioration, the patient was transferred to the MICU
for further care.
While in the MICU the patient had a TTE that showed a large
pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade (LVEF 55%).  He
was taken for an urgent pericardiocentesis. He continued on a
course of antibiotics for a UTI.
.
In the cardiac cath lab he had 600 cc of clear pericardial fluid
drained.
On arrival to the CCU his chest pain was resolving and his
breathing was improved.
.
ROS: The patient denies any dyspnea, fevers, diarrhea,
constipation ( BM [**8-2**] ), vomiting, dysuria. He does report
decreased amount of urine recently. He also endorses fatigue,
malaise, poor appetite. No increased leg swelling, at baseline
his left leg is swollen since a prior broken leg. He endorses
dyspnea on exertion and exertional angina with walking up stairs
quickly or walking carrying heavy bundles.  The shortness of
breath has been most notable over the past 3 days.

response. Low voltage in limb leads. Non-specific inferolateral

the rhythm is now atrial fibrillation. Limb lead voltage is
lower. Clinical correlation is suggested. The precordial lead
voltage is also lower.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo M w/ IDDM, CKD, HTN, presented with malaise, respiratory
failure and renal failure, found to have pericardial effusion,
s/p pericardiocentesis, developed Afib with RVR, pleural
effusion.
.
# Pericardial effusion:
TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with evidence of
tamponade. He was taken to the cardiac cath lab for an urgent
pericardiocentesis. Approximately 600 cc of clear pericardial
fluid was drained, resulting in improvement in his symptoms. The
tap was traumatic, but the pericardial fluid was clear and
non-bloody per report. Cytology revealed no malignant cells.
Echo following pericardiocentesis showed decreased pericardial
effusion and no signs of tamponade. The patient was monitored
clinically and with repeat echocardiograms which demonstrated
further decreases in the size of the pericardial effusion. The
effusion was likely of viral etiology given his history of
recent prodromal symptoms. Less likely etiologies include
malignancy (dysplastic nevi noted - r/o melanoma; has not been
seen by a dermatologist
