[**10-12**] CXR: The heart is enlarged consistent with cardiomegaly.
There is a left chest wall biventricular pacemaker with the
leads in good position on this single projection. There is
interval placement of a right IJ central line with the tip in
the right atrium. If the position desired is the SVC, recommend
pulling back approximately 4 cm. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. There is perihilar haziness and bilateral small
pleural effusions, findings consistent with CHF. The patient is
status post median sternotomy and CABG. The aorta is tortuous.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval placement of right IJ central line with the tip in
the right atrium.
2. Findings consistent with congestive heart failure and
pulmonary edema.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**2161-10-17**]: CT Abdomen/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
2. No bowel wall thickening or abscess is detected.
3. Colon diffusely distended with air and stool.
4. Cholelithiasis.
.
[**2161-10-17**]: portable abominal x-ray
FINDINGS: There is gaseous distention of the entire colon. There
is gas and feces visualized in the right and the left colon and
the rectum. There are no evidence of mechanical obstruction of
the small or large bowel. On the upright film there is no
evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
.
IMPRESSION: Gaseous distention of the colon. No evidence of
bowel obstruction. No evidence of free air.
.
[**2161-10-19**]: left upper extremity ultrasound
UNILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND, LEFT: Both [**Doctor Last Name 352**]
scale and color Doppler ultrasound was used for this evaluation.
There is normal compressibility of the left cephalic, basilic,
paired brachial, axillary, and jugular veins. There is normal
respiratory variation in the left jugular, subclavian, axillary,
paired brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins. No intraluminal
filling defect identified. No deep venous thrombosis.
.
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis.
.
[**2161-10-19**] TTE:
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

.
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is
severely depressed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. No evidence of endocarditis seen..
7. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape
unavailable for
review) of [**2161-9-17**], the mitral regurgitation is less.
.
[**10-21**] chest ultrasound:
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? abscess/infected pacer pocket
INDICATION: Pacer, septic.

Limited ultrasound of the chest wall was performed around the
pacer demonstrating no fluid collections. No evidence of
abscess.
.
[**10-24**] Left wrist x-ray

There is mild diffuse osteopenia. There is severe narrowing of
the radiocarpal joint with essentially complete loss of the
joint space. There is a large relatively well circumscribed (15
mm) lucency in the subchondral portion of the distal radius,
abutting the distal radioulnar joint. There is moderate
degenerative narrowing of the first CMC joint. There is also
slight narrowing of the triscaphe joint. There is ill-definition
of the distal corner of the scaphoid radially -- ? subtle
erosion. Incidental note is made of an ossicle adjacent to the
ulnar styloid. There is diffuse soft tissue edema with faint
vascular calcification.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Soft tissue edema about the wrist.

2. Marked degenerative narrowing of the radiocarpal joint and to
a lesser extent the first CMC joint.

3. Subchondral lucency in the distal radius medially. Because it
is relatively well circumscribed, this most likely represents a
large degenerative subchondral cyst (geode).

4. Faint chondrocalcinosis over triangular fibrocartilage. This
can be seen in CPPD, hyperparathyroidism, or hemochromatosis.

5. Ill-definition of the scaphoid -- this is not well seen on
the oblique view and may be an artifact due to a small spur.

6. Otherwise, no findings specific for osteomyelitis.
.
[**2161-10-25**] CXR:
Since the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated
with endotracheal tube terminating at the thoracic inlet level.
A right subclavian vascular catheter has been placed and has an
unusual midline location with respect to the mediastinum. A
nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm.

No pneumothorax is identified.

The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Pulmonary vascularity is
within normal limits for supine technique. No definite areas of
consolidation are observed in either lung. There is subcutaneous
emphysema in the right chest wall.
.
IMPRESSION:
1) Unusual midline position of central venous catheter. This
appears much more medial than anticipated fo
