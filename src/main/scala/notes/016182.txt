Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
77 year old male,recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**]  for CHF
exacerbation,thought to be due to to urosepsis(e.coli). His stay
was complicated by GI bleed, resulting in demand ischemia. He
was discharged to a nursing home on ceftriaxone. This time, the
patient presented to [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital on [**1-28**] with dyspnea,
diaphoresis, hypoxia, telemetry showed supraventricular
tachycardia (aflutter vs fib. He was intubated for airway
protection and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for further care. He was
noted to have a both an elevated WBC >16 and a metabolic
acidosis, though in the setting of acute renal failure.

In the CCU pt recieved Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone for presumed
community aquired pneumonia and was extubated in [**5-10**] hours after
intubation. He was on heparin for ~24 hours as he ruled in for
an MI by enzymes. He was monitored in the unit for 24 hours and
transferred to medical floor on [**2107-1-30**].

Radiology
CXR [**2107-1-29**]- AP FINDINGS: The patient has been intubated in the
interval, with endotracheal tube 2.5 cm above the carina. Median
sternotomy sutures are again seen, with mediastinal clips.
Allowing for rotation, the lungs are probably minimally changed
in appearance. Prominent lung markings are on the left, which
may be chronic vs representing edema/infection. There appears to
be a layering left- sided pleural effusion, most prominent at
the left apex, possibly combined with pleural thickening. There
has been some volume loss on the left. No evidence of
pneumothorax.

[**Month/Day/Year **] [**2107-2-1**]-Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot exclude).

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2106-8-23**], left
ventricular systolic function the anterior wall motion now
appears improved and the inferior wall appears similar.

Chest PA/Lat [**2107-1-31**]-IMPRESSION:
1. Apparent diffuse opacification of the left hemithorax, likely
secondary to rotation and technique. However, a layering
effusion or other acute process is difficult to exclude.
Followup radiographs could help clarify this. No evidence of
focal pneumonia.
2. Stable left-sided volume loss and pleural thickening.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Shortness of breath- Pt was intubated for SOB at OSH and
transferred to the CCU.  His attending cardiologist felt that
his primary cause of SOB and tachycardia was not cardiac in
origin but more related to an infectious etiology. There he was
diuresed with an improvement in his SOB and started on Levaquin
and vancomycin.  He was quickly extubated and transfered to the
floor.  His SOB was likely secondary to worsening heart failure
related to his underlying infection (tracheo bronchitis) as well
as his acute MI in the setting of demand ischemia. On physical
exam initially, there were no signs of CHF, though he did
receive lasix at the OSH with some improvement.

Pneumonia was unlikely.  On CXR initially, a stable left lower
opacity was seen, thought to be related to an old resection for
TB. CT edmonstrated no consolidation.  Sputum grew out MRSA with
oral flora. This may be the etiologic agents or may represent
colonization as pt lives in nursing home. Aspiration as a cause
for his tracheobronchitis is very possible.  He has severe
Parkinson's Disease and becomes extreemly rigid when missing his
Sinemet giving him a profound aspiration risk.  He remained
afebrile throughout his hospital course and his white count on
admission was decreased from previous measurements at the OSH.
He was treated with a 14 day course of vancomycin and levaquin
to cover the organisms.  He has a PICC line and will only need
an additional 5 days of vanc after leaving the hospital. This
will need to be removed once he has completed his treatement
course and sent for cultures.

2. Coronary Artery Disease and [**Name (NI) **] Pt with LBBB on EKG that is
old. He is S/p CABG with 3 VD. He ruled in for an MI with a peak
CK of 560.  His hsopital course was not comlicated by arrythmias
and he was aggresively treated with beta blockers, plavix, asa,
ACE inhibitor, and statin.  His MI occured in the setting of
demand ischemia due to his infection and atrial tachycardia.
There is a questionably history of atrial fibrillation though
this was never demonstarted on ECG.

Pt was rate controlled with beta blocker. He was initially on IV
lopressor and once NGT was placed, metoprolol was titrated up to
***
We continued ASA, statin, beta blocker, and plavix.

3. Acute renal failure/hypernatremia-
Creatinine was 1.4 on admission and improved to *** with
hydration. Pt was hypernatremic on admission to the medicine
floor to 147. He was repleted with free water as hypernatremia
improved.

4.History of GIB
Pt has a history of LGIB on last admission. It may be from from
diverticulosis, though pt did not have his Outpt colonoscopy as
of yet. Hematocrit was stable throughout the hospital course.
T&S was active and rectal guaic was trace positive. Pt was kept
on a PPI.

5. Tachycardia
Pt tachycardic previously now in 80-100s. Likely atrial
tachycardia vs. flutter. Mr. [**Known lastname 99933**] was rate controlled with
metoprolol which was titrated up.

6. F/E/[**Name (NI) **] Pt was seen to be a great aspiration risk. NGT was
placed on transfer to the medicine floor but pt pulled it.
Several attempts were made the next day but placement was
difficult as twice it went to th
