Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2129-11-8**]):  NEGATIVE FOR
LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.

CXR [**11-5**] (final): New consolidation within anterior segment of
right upper lobe with minimal involvement in right middle lobe.
These findings are consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate
clinical setting. Followup radiographs after completion of
antibiotic therapy are recommended to insure complete resolution
and to exclude other process.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 104678**] has a history of asthma, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia and presented with pleuritic chest pain, cough
and in the emergency department, had progressive hypoxia and
hypotension.  Her CXR showed evidency of right lower lobe and
right middle lobe pneumonia.

For her sepsis, likely due to her pneumonia given the positive
chest x-ray and absence of other symptoms, the sepsis protocol
was initiated.  Ceftriaxone 1g IV q24 and Levaquin 500 mg qd
were given.  A left subclavian line was placed and she was given
4 liters of normal saline in the emergency department.  She was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring.  Her blood pressure
remained stable while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

For her multilobar pneumonia, which was believed to be community
acquired, she was changed from levaquin to azithromycin 500mg qd
(to complete a 10 day course) and was continued on ceftriaxone
for a total of four days. Urinary Legionella antigen was
negative.  Her lung exam improved signficantly by the day of
discharge to the point that her rhonchi cleared.

For her asthma, her advair was continued and she was given
albuterol-ipratroprium nebs.  In addition, she was given
prednisone 40mg qd for two days followed by a one week taper
(40-30-30-20-20-10-10-off).

For her pleuritic pain, she was given toradol which kept her
pain under good control.  The pain improved signficantly once
the prednisone was initiated.

For her diabetes mellitus, type 1, she was initially placed on
an insulin gtt.  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was placed on her home regimen
of regular insulin, sliding scale plus a PM dose of lantus.  Her
sugars were relatively well controlled until steroids were added
and they improved once the steroids were tapered down.

For her anxiety, she was given ativan 0.5mg qPM.

For access, her subclavian line was discontinued on [**9-7**].

Communication was with her and her husband.

She was discharged home directly from the MICU in good condition
and will followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] in [**2-11**] weeks.
