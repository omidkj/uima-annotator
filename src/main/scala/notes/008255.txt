Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left lower extremity below the knee amputation

History of Present Illness:
72 yo with hx of DM2, HTN, HLD, Afib, dCHF (EF 70%), PVD, recent
admit for LLE ulcerations to vascular service discharged on [**10-8**]
p/w constant CP since 6pm after dinner. She describes CP as
nonradiating gas-like bubble, mid sternal. Mylanta was [**Last Name (un) 28405**]
without relief and pt vomited clear sputum. VS were 98.9, 100,
18, 188/100, 96%/RA. Nitro X3 was given without relief.
.
During her recent hospitalization on [**9-25**] she became agitated,
hypertensive and bradycardic. During that time she had a
troponin elevation to a max of 0.31 and was evaluated by
cardiology. This was felt to be related to demmand and it was
advised to perform a TTE and possible f/u stress vs cath.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.3, 75, 184/86, 18, 100%/RA.
Labs significant for Trop <0.01, Creatinine 1.9 (basline 1.7),
BNP 4887 (without prior), WBC 5.4, Hct 27, INR 1.2.
UA with few bact, [**2-6**] epis. Urine culture was sent. CXR showed
cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema with resolved pleural effusion
compared to prior (IM HO read).
EKG showed afib at 63, TWI I, AvL, V5 V6 similar to prior.
She was given 325mg ASA, Magic mouthwash, lidocaine viscous,
Morphine, Pantoprazole. Nitro did not work.
.
CP resolved spontaneously VS on transfer: 145/73, 64, 17,
100%/2L
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, black stools or
red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of
the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current
chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
Patient reports that she does not have current chest pressure.
She is unsure what made it resolve in the ED. She denies dysuria
and states that she is on the antibiotics for her leg only.
.
Of note, review of the discharge instructions reveals that the
patient was discharged on multiple blood pressure medications
including lisinopril and increased dose of lasix.

LABS/STUDIES
EKG: afib rate 65, LAD, TWI I, avL similar to prior and mild
increase in inversion/flattening in V5, C6
.

.
TTE [**2195-9-26**]
Moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
regional and global biventricular systolic function. Mild right
ventricular dilation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis. Elevated
estimated PCWP. EF 70-75%.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-3-15**],
the right ventricle now appears mildly dilated. Aortic valve
stenosis has slightly progressed (but is still mild).
.
CT head [**2195-10-13**]:
Images are slightly limited by patient motion artifact. Within
this constraint, there is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema,
mass effect, or
vascular territorial infarction. Ventricles and sulci are normal
in size and
configuration. Punctate basal ganglia calcifications are
bilateral. There is
no fracture. Mastoid air cells are clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 72 year old female with a history of DM type 2,

dCHF, HL, HTN, and atrial fibrillation with a complicated
hospital course during this admission.
.
She was previously admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2195-9-22**] through
[**2195-10-8**] for management of LLE venous ulcers. During that
admission had multiple triggers for hypertensive urgency, A-fib
with RVR, Dyspnea. Non invasive LE vascular studies demonstrated
venous and arterial disease not amenable to percutaneous
intervention. Wound cultures grew Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and
Enterococcus. She was treated initially with vancomycin and
Zosyn then discharge to rehab [**10-8**] with ciprofloxacin +
augmentin. On [**10-10**] she was re-admitted to the cardiology service
for chest pain. MI was ruled out. She then became febrile and
was taken to OR for left BKA [**2195-10-10**] as source was presumed to
be distal LLE infected ulcer. She continued her care in the
vascular service. She remained febrile after surgery upto 103.0.
Vancomycin and Zosyn were started on [**2195-10-12**] then switched to
Vanc + Cefepime + Metronidazole. In addition fluconazole was
started for yeast in the urine. On [**10-15**] she became somnulent
and difficult to arouse and was transferr
