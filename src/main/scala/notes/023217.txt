ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies alcohol or tobacco use.
She lives alone.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother had a stroke at age 57.  There is
no family history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, or
hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The heart rate is 69,
blood pressure 147/69, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation
is 99% on 2 liters by nasal cannula.  The patient is
afebrile.  General:  The patient is in no apparent distress.
HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
bilaterally.  Extraocular eye movements were intact.  The
mucous membranes were moist.  Neck:  There are no carotid
bruits bilaterally.  CVS:  Has regular, rate, and rhythm.
There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdominal:  Bowel sounds are
pleasant.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  Rectal:  Occult
blood negative.  Extremities:  Distal pulses are palpable
bilaterally.  There is no lower extremity edema.  There is a
right sheath in the right groin.

LABORATORIES:  White count is 11.0, hematocrit 42.2,
platelets 309.  Sodium 137, potassium 3.9, chloride 96,
bicarb 26, BUN 24, creatinine 1.3, glucose 125.  A CK is
1,387, MB 174, troponin greater than 50.  Arterial blood gas
shows a pH of 7.42, CO2 of 42, oxygen of 78.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 74.
There is [**Street Address(2) 101748**] depression in V1 through V5.  There is
upright T wave in V1.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:  There is total occlusion of the
proximal left circumflex.  This was stented.  The mid left
anterior descending artery has an 80% lesion before the
diagonal.  There were faint collaterals to antengel small
distal vessels at the end of initially occluded OM-1.  There
was 70% ramus.  The right coronary artery has a 50% stenosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU after
her cardiac catheterization, where her left circumflex was
stented.  There was an 80% lesion of the left anterior
descending artery, which was not intervened on.

1. Cardiovascular:  The patient had a non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction by enzymes.  She had her left
circumflex stented in the catheterization laboratory.  Her
80% left anterior descending artery was not intervened upon.
It is recommended the patient have a stress test as an
outpatient to determine if the lesion in the left anterior
descending artery is significant.  The patient was started on
aspirin and Plavix postprocedure.  She was also started on
low-dose beta blocker.  The patient was not started on an ACE
inhibitor as her blood pressure ran in the low 100s after the
addition of the beta blocker.  The patient was initially
maintained on Integrilin for 18 hours after cardiac
catheterization.

The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram during this
admission.  This showed an ejection fraction of 60-65%.
There was mild dilation of the left atrium.  Otherwise, the
echocardiogram was normal.  There were no wall motion
abnormalities noted.

2. Hematology:  The day after the patient's cardiac
catheterization, she was noted to have a 10 point hematocrit
drop down to a hematocrit of 31.  A CT scan was obtained to
rule out retroperitoneal bleed.  This revealed a hematoma in
the right thigh.  The patient was transfused 1 unit of packed
red blood cells.  Her hematocrit bumped appropriately.  Her
hematocrit remains stable throughout the rest of her stay in
the hospital.

3. Renal:  The patient's creatinine was slightly elevated
during this admission.  Her baseline creatinine is
approximately 1.0-1.1.  Her hematocrit was 1.3-1.4 during
this admission.  This was felt secondary to dye received
during cardiac catheterization.  Her creatinine should be
checked as an outpatient.

4. Endocrine:  The patient has a history of hypothyroidism.
Her thyroid function was checked and was normal during this
admission.

5. Pulmonary:  The patient has a history of bronchiectasis,
though she has no active pulmonary issues during this
admission.

6. GI:  The patient was kept on a proton-pump inhibitor
during her stay in hospital.

7. FEN:  The patient was started on a low sodium, cardiac
diet during this admission.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction, status post stenting of left circumflex.
2. Right thigh hematoma.
3. Anemia, requiring transfusions.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Hypertension.
6. Hypothyroidism.
7. Left lower lobe bronchiectasis.
8. Monoclonal gammopathy.
9. Neuropathy.
10. Degenerative joint disease.

MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE:
1. Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
2. Plavix 75 mg po q day for nine months.
3. Lopressor 12.5 mg po q day.
4. Lipitor 10 mg po q hs.
5. Levothyroxine 50 mcg po q day.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient will follow up for
Cardiology with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9474**] on [**11-23**] at 10 am.
The patient will require an outpatient stress test to
evaluate whether her left anterior descending artery lesion
requires intervention.  She should also have an outpatient
abdominal/pelvic ultrasound to evaluate a left ovarian cyst
which was found incidentally during this admission.  The
patient will continue to be followed by her primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
