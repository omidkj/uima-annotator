History of Present Illness:
Information obtained [**Last Name (un) 7245**] from ED records and prior OMR notes
as patient is intubated and family is not present. PMH of ERSD
on HD, dCHF, COPD, DM.
Patient is well known to ICU and renal service and has been
admitted several times to the MICU over the last month with
respiratory failure from presumed diet non-compliance. Today he
was at home and was found in respiratory distress with sats in
the 70's on room air.
He was intubated in the field by EMS and brought here to the ED.

In the ED, initial vs were: 186/78, 98.3, 74 and intubated
sating 100% on 40% FiO2. CXR showed ? LLL infiltrate and he
received a dose of CTX, vanc and levo. He also received a dose
of solumedrol for possible COPD exacerbation. Trop 0.1 (priors
0.04-0.2).

On the floor, patient is intuabted and sedated. Unable to
complete reivew of systems.

ECG [**2160-2-3**]: Sinus rhythm. Right axis deviation. Possible
anterior myocardial infarction of undetermined age. Non-specific
T wave flattening in lead aVL. No previous tracing available for
comparison.

ECG [**2160-2-3**]: Sinus rhythm. Possible anteroseptal myocardial
infarction of undetermined age. Non-specific T wave flattening
in lead aVL. Compared to tracing #1 no significant difference.

CXR [**2160-2-3**]: SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: An endotracheal tube
tip lies 4.2 cm from the carina. The heart is upper limits of
normal in size, with markedly atherosclerotic calcifications of
the aortic arch and descending aorta.  Opacity at the left lower
lobe likely relates to atelectasis given leftward shift of the
mediastinum, although underlying smaller effusion and/or
consolidation is not excluded. The right lung is clear.
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube tip 4 cm from the carina.
2. Left base opacity with leftward shift of the mediastinum
suggest left lower lobe collapse/atelectasis. Underlying pleural
effusion and/or consolidation not excluded.

Echocardiogram [**2160-2-5**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad. Compared
with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-12-6**], the findings are similar.

CXR [**2160-2-5**]: The patient was extubated in the meantime interval
with removal of the NG tube. There is worsening of the left
lower lobe opacity which has a triangular shape accompanied by
mediastinal shift and is most likely consistent with left lower
lobe complete atelectasis accompanied by pleural effusion. Small
amount of right pleural effusion is most likely unchanged. Upper
lungs are essentially clear and the cardiomediastinal silhouette
is unremarkable as much as it can be assessed.

CXR [**2160-2-6**]: Left lower lobe collapse and moderate left pleural
effusion have been present to more or less the same degree more
than a month. Small right pleural effusion and milder right
basal atelectasis are also longstanding. Heart size is normal.
Upper lobes grossly clear. Thoracic aorta very heavily calcified
but not dilated. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M with ESRD on HD, dCHF, COPD here with hypoxic
respiratory failure.

# Hypoxic respiratory Failure: 70% RA on at home per EMS report.
Intubated in field. Now sating 100% on 30% FiO2. CXR without
volume overload - there was suspicion for mucous plugging
contributing to atelectasis or possible aspiration event.
Patient was initially treated with v
