HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67 year old female
with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
morbid obesity recently discharged from [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2114-4-18**], after a 40 day hospital course
for esophageal rupture secondary to food product getting
stuck and she is status post left thoraco abdominal surgical
repair of the perforation with omental flap and open
jejunostomy tube and gastrostomy tube.  She presents to the
Emergency Department today from her rehabilitation facility
for complaint of shortness of breath.

The patient, during her prior hospital stay, had a prolonged
intubation complicated by tracheostomy tube placement and
mucous plugging requiring ventilatory assistance multiple
times with development of then vent associated bilobar
Klebsiella pneumonia treated with Meropenem.  She also had
intra abdominal abscesses near her perforation site that was
drained with Interventional Radiology guidance.  The patient
was doing well in the rehabilitation facility until several
days prior to admission when she developed shortness of
breath.  A chest x-ray at the time at the outpatient facility
showed a white out of the left lung with a left shift in
trachea.  The patient was in respiratory distress, had a low
grade fever and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at
[**Hospital1 69**] on the day of admission.

A CT scan with pulmonary embolus cuts was done which showed
no evidence of pulmonary embolus but did show left upper lobe
collapse versus consolidation.  A bronchoscopy done on the
next hospital day yielded scant secretions and the patient
was started on meropenem and Vancomycin for presumed
recurrent pneumonia.  The patient improved clinically over
the next one to two days.  The patient also was noted to have
an enterococcal bacteremia that was thought secondary to her
peripherally inserted central catheter line which was pulled
at the time of report of positive blood cultures.  A repeat
abdominal CT scan was done to evaluate the abscesses which
showed improvement of the fluid collections noted on the
prior study.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission revealed a temperature of
100.8 F.; pulse 126; blood pressure 95/50; respiratory rate
35; pulse oximetry 94 percent on 15 liters of trache mask.
In general, she is an obese female lying on a stretcher,
tachypneic, able to whisper some phrases, in mild respiratory
distress, intermittently less responsive and fatigued.
HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular muscles intact.  Dry mucous membranes.
Oropharynx was clear.  Upper dentures were present.  Neck
with no obvious jugular venous distention; supple.
Cardiovascular examination was tachycardic with a positive S1
and positive S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary
showed decreased breath sounds in the left anterior and
posterior lung fields, as well as an occasional expiratory
wheeze and right sided good air movement with occasional
wheeze and occasional rhonchi throughout.  Her abdominal
examination showed it was soft, obese, nontender, positive
bowel sounds.  No masses.  Some palpable firm subcutaneous
nodules were evident likely from prior injection sites.
Extremities were warm with two plus distal pulses.  No edema,
no cords.  Equal bilaterally.  Neurological examination:  The
patient is moving all four extremities and answering
questions appropriately.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, her white blood cell count
was 12.6, hematocrit 31.2, platelets 476, neutrophils 84
percent, 10 percent lymphocytes.  No bands.

Her chem-7 was sodium of 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 96,
bicarbonate 30, BUN 23, creatinine 0.5, glucose 101, lactate
1.7.  ABG 7.49, pCO2 of 40, paO2 of 84.  O2 saturation 96
percent.  Urinalysis negative.

Chest x-ray in the Emergency Department showed a complete
white out of the left thorax and left shift of trachea.

Chest x-ray after bronchoscopy showed minimal aeration of the
left thorax, left atelectasis, mild pleural effusion.  CT
angiogram of the chest showed negative for pulmonary embolus,
left upper lobe collapse versus consolidation and left lower
lobe patchy atelectasis.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. PULMONARY:  In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had a
   bronchoscopy performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], which yielded
   thin frothy secretions in the right and left side of the
   airways to subsegmental level, but no other pathology was
   noted.  The cultures from the bronchoscopy displayed no
   growth to date.  The bronchoscopy was performed on
   [**2114-4-27**].

The patient was treated for a suspected recurrence of her
pneumonia with meropenem and Vancomycin for double coverage
of a Klebsiella or methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.  The patient was ruled out for pulmonary embolus by
CT angiogram and the leading diagnosis was thought to be
secondary to mucous plugging from either difficulty clearing
secretions versus recurrence of her pneumonia.  The patient
improved gradually and was transferred to the floor for
further care.  She received nebulizer treatments on a regular
basis as well as was continued on her outpatient dose of
prednisone for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
She will be treated for a total of 21 days for vent
associated pneumonia with meropenem, the course of which will
finish on [**2114-5-7**].

The patient was tolerating room air prior to discharge and
her O2 saturations were in the range of 93 to 96 percent.  In
addition, the patient was able to clear her own secretions
through the tracheostomy tube.  She was continued with chest
physical therapy and nebulized oxygen as needed.

1. BACTEREMIA:  The patient was noted to have enterococcal
   bacteremia on [**4-28**], which was thought secondary to a
   peripherally inserted central catheter.  The catheter was
   removed when the culture results returned, and the patient
   was started on linezolid with her history of Vancomycin
   resistant enterococcus.

The patient also has noted abdominal abscesses and the source
of the enterococcal bacteremia with both species of
Enterococcal faecalis as well as a Staphylococcus epidermidis
bacteremia, it was felt possibly related to those abscess
sources; however, the CT scan showed regression of these
abscesses and it was thought to be less likely due to her
abdominal abscesses versus her line bacteremia.

Infectious Disease was consulted on [**2114-5-1**], for
assistance with antibiotic therapy and recommended
surveillance cultures to evaluate the patient's bacteremia.
The patient will be treated for a total of seven days of
linezolid if surveillance blood cultures remain negative.
The patient remained afebrile throughout the remainder of her
hospital stay with slight elevation in her white blood cell
count likely secondary to her chronic steroid use.

1. FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
   continued on tube feeds through her J-tube for feeding and
   G-tube was used for decompression as needed.  The patient
   was given free water boluses to maintain euvolemic state.

1. PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was continued on heparin
   subcutaneously as she remained immobile throughout her
   hospital stay.  In addition, a proton pump inhibitor was
   added due to her chronic steroid use as well as her
   possible risk for stress ulcerations.


DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient's discharge status was to a
rehabilitation facility
