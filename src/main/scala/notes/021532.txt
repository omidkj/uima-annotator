PERTINENT STUDIES
# LENI [**6-22**]
IMPRESSION:  Limited examination, no evidence for DVT.  The calf
veins were
not visualized.

# CXR PA/LAT [**6-22**]
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.

# TIB/FIB (AP&LAT) SOFT [**6-22**]
IMPRESSION:  Extensive soft tissue edema without underlying
subcutaneous gas.

# CT LOWER EXTREMITY [**6-22**]
IMPRESSION:
Severe soft tissue edema, compatible with patient's known
history of
cellulitis.  Some areas of edema appear confluent, however no
discrete
organizing fluid collection is identified.  No subcutaneous gas.
 Underlying bony structures are intact.

# LUNG SCAN [**6-23**]
IMPRESSION: Normal perfusion study. Normal lung scan rules our
recent pulmonary embolism.

# CXR PORTABLE [**6-24**]
IMPRESSION:
Low lung volumes.  Left costophrenic angle not entirely
included.  Despite the low lung volumes, however, there is
increasing fullness and indistinctness to the pulmonary
vascularity suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  A more focal
opacity at the retrocardiac region may reflect patchy
atelectasis.  Aspiration or pneumonia would be also in the
differential.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
contours appear stable given portable technique.

# CXR PORTABLE [**6-25**]
FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.
 Worsening
pulmonary edema is present, with now confluent perihilar
airspace opacities, right greater than left.  No definite
pleural effusions, but extreme lateral right costophrenic sulcus
has been excluded from the study and cannot be assessed.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo male with history of DM, HTN, morbid obesity and
peripheral edema presenting with right lower extremity swelling
and pain with acute onset of shortness of breath.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Cellulitis: Patient presented with cellulitis, with no
evidence of necrotizing fasciatis by CT and US criteria.  His
initial presentation is concerning for SIRS.  Blood culture
however has been negative.  LENI was negative for DVT.  He was
covered with broad spectrum antibiotics initially Vancomycin
and unasyn. Later Vancomycin and Zosyn were started given
diabetes and lack of clinical impovement. ID was also consulted
given lack of clinical improvement. The patient was followed by
surgery out of concern for necrotizing fascitiis. CT scan of the
LLE did not show evidence of necrotizing fasicitis and his lower
exam improved with antibiotic therapy while in MICU. He was
transitioned from IV vancomycin and zosyn to IV vancomycin and
PO flagyl and ciprofloxacin to complete a 14 day course (last
day [**7-7**]) with steady improvement in LE cellulitis.

# Dyspnea: Pt presented with dyspnea.  There were initial
concerns of PE.  He was ruled out by negative LENI and V/Q scan.
 Pt developed increasing requirement of O2 during this
admission.  His CXR however was concerning for pulmonary edema.
This likely developed in the setting of IVF resuscitation.
Though there was concern versus capiilary leak in the setting of
infection versus a cardiogenic cause for his pulmonary edema.
His ECHO showed no focal wall motion abnormalities and no
evidence of systolic heart failure.  His lung exam was
significant for diffuse wheeze, although he had no history of
asthma or COPD.  He was treated with boluses of iv lasix, broad
coverage antibiotics and frequent nebulizer.  While in the MICU,
the patient was also started on a lasix drip, to which he put
out approximately 7 liters to in one day. With aggressive,
diuresis, the patient's respiratory status improved. On the
floor, he continued to diurese and his saturations steadily
increased and eventually returned to baseline satting in the
high 90s on room air.

# [**Last Name (un) **]: Pt was found to have acute kidney injury on presentation.
 His urine lytes was consistent with poor perfusion, likely in
setting of heart fai
