CXR [**2136-9-10**]:
PA AND LATERAL CHEST: Compared to [**2136-8-2**]. Heart size is normal.
Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is a
left-sided subclavian line with its tip in the region of the
left brachiocephalic vein just short of midline. No focal
consolidation or other acute cardiopulmonary process. Stable
appearing calcified pleural plaques.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
Ten radiographs of the left foot are submitted. The external
fixator seen on [**2136-9-10**] has been removed. Previously seen
antibiotic beads are no longer present. Patient is now seen to
be status post arthrodesis of the first tarsal-metatarsal joint.
A bone stimulator is present with the electrodes seen along the
junction of the tibia and hindfoot. Vascular calcifications are
noted. Limited assessment of the knee joint is grossly
unremarkable. Fine osseous and soft tissue detail is obscured by
overlying casting material. Postoperative change involving the
second through fifth metatarsals remains similar in appearance.
Proximal phalanx of the third toe is again noted to be
surgically absent. With the exception of the first ray
arthrodesis, the forefoot findings remain similar in appearance.
.
FLUOR GUIDED PICC PLACEMENT:
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 4 French single lumen PICC
line placement via left brachial vein approach. Final catheter
length is 47 cm. Tip position is in the high right atrium. The
catheter is ready to employ. Post- procedural orders written.
.
PORT ASSESSMENT BY FLUORO:
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Timeout was performed to identify the
patient, the procedure to be performed, the site of the
procedure, appropriate requisition, and appropriate informed
consent. Once the above were verified, the patient was
positioned in supine fashion on a special procedures table. The
left- sided single lumen chest port was noted to have an access
needle in place underneath the transparent dressing. Utilizing
usual aseptic precautions, the hub of the access needle was
accessed and contrast administered by hand injection under
fluoroscopy. Images demonstrate the proximal limb of the port
catheter to be retained in the distal left brachiocephalic vein,
just distal to the confluence of both the right and left
brachiocephalic veins in close apposition to the vein wall
inferiorly. Infusion of the port and the port catheter was then
possible, however, aspiration was not possible. No superior vena
cava obstruction is seen. The contrast column was seen in
continuity to the level of the right atrium. (A DSA venogram was
performed and recorded.)
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal tip positioning of port catheter in left
brachiocephalic vein as described above. No evidence of SVC
stenosis. Unable to aspirate from the catheter.
.
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Airway patent to the segmental level.
There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the axilla,
mediastinum, or hilum. Scattered shotty mediastinal lymph nodes,
all less than a centimeter in short axis. There is prominent
coronary artery and diffuse vascular calcification. Central
venous line in place with its tip in the distal SVC. Heart,
pericardium, and great vessels are otherwise unremarkable. Mild
emphysema. There are several tiny pulmonary nodules less than 5
mm in diameter. The most prominent is in the right upper lobe
(series 9, image 21) measuring 4 mm. Tiny (2-mm) pulmonary
nodules in the right lower lobe (9, 37), and left lower lobe (9,
40). Tiny nonspecific subpleural nodular opacity in the right
upper lobe (9, 25). Extensive calcified pleural plaques, likely
the sequela of prior asbestos exposure. Dependent posterior
pleural thickening/small effusions.

CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Non-contrast portion of
the scan demonstrates diffuse dense vascular calcification,
gallstones, and large right-sided renal calculi, one within the
pelvis at the mid pole and the other within the proximal ureter.
There are some surrounding inflammatory changes, but no evidence
of significant hydronephrosis from these calculi. Small non-
obstructing left-sided calculi are also present.
Mild-to-moderate splenomegaly is noted. Contrast-enhanced
portion through the abdomen demonstrates a nodular liver with
volume redistrubution with patchy perfusion of the peripheral
aspect of the right lobe, and it is difficult to exclude an
infiltrating lesion, especially in segment V/VI. Additionally,
there are several small hypoattenuating lesions within segment
[**Last Name (LF) 7060**], [**First Name3 (LF) 690**], III, and VI, which are too small to characterize.
While these lesions may represent small cysts or hemangiomas,
metastases are not excluded. Portal venous system appears
patent. No thrombus is visualized within the hepatic veins.
Minimal fullness of the anterior limb of the left adrenal gland
without distinct nodularity. There are several tiny shotty
mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, most prominent
around the celiac axis, however, none are pathologically
enlarged by CT criteria.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is circumferential mural
thickening around the proximal sigmoid, concerning for primary
colon cancer. There are diffuse diverticuli in this region, but
no surrounding stranding to suggest acute diverticulitis.
However, more superiorly along the lateral aspect of the
descending colon, there are mild inflammatory changes and fluid,
nonspecific in nature. Within the pelvis, there are small
subcentimeter, but borderline left retroperitoneal nodes,
measuring up to 8 mm in diameter. Additionally, in the left deep
pelvis just medial to the lower pole of the left kidney and at
the level of the aortic bifurcation, there is a 3.3 x 3.3 well-
circumscribed cystic lesion demonstrating a dense fluid level
dependently, which could represent a necrotic lymph node. This
node displaces, but does not appear to obstruct the left ureter.
Remainder of the colon demonstrates no evidence of other areas
of lesions or mural thickening. There are vascular borderline
enlarged bilateral inguinal lymph nodes.

BONE WINDOWS: There are diffuse degenerative changes and
evidence of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis involving
the thoracic levels anteriorly, but no suspicious lytic or
blastic lesions. Isolated hyperdense focus in the right femur is
likely a bone island.

MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS: Coronal and sagittal reformatted images
confirm the above findings.
