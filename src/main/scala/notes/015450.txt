CXR ([**2113-3-20**]):As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
no major change. The lung volumes are low; the size of the
cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged.  Left pectoral
implantation of a pacemaker device, unremarkable course and
position of the lead. There is extensive retrocardiac
atelectasis that, however, preexisted. On today's radiograph,
there is no evidence of newly appeared parenchymal opacities
suggestive of pneumonia.
.
PICC placement ([**2113-3-21**]): Uncomplicated ultrasound and
fluoroscopically guided 5 French double lumen PICC line
placement via the left brachial venous approach. Final internal
length is 52 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC. The line is
ready to use.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] Y F w/ hc CAD s/p MI, CHF with EF>60% in [**1-24**], pafib not on
rate/rhythm control nor anticoagluation, sent form [**Hospital 100**] rehab
on [**3-19**] with BRBPR x 2, hypotension to sbp 60s.
.
# Massive LGIB (massive acute blood loss anemia), s/p
hypotension, with continued bleeding
MICU course:
- Nitropatch was removed in the ED and pt was given 500cc bolus,
then admitted to the MICU where her bp remained stable overnight
without further bleeding.
- Her son [**Name (NI) 382**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] on admission stating that he
prefers conservative management and would like to avoid
colonoscopy uncless pt continued to bleed then he would be
willing to discuss it.
- 2 large bore peripheral IV were placed on admission
- Pt was given one unit so prbc's and placed on [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI on
admission (and high dose PPI [**Hospital1 **] continued on discharge).
- Prior to transferring out to the floor ASA was restarted
CC7 course:
- On the am of HOD#3 pt had a large bm with brb and then another
a few hours later.  She was immediately given one unit of
prbc's, and another one later to maintain hct 30
- pt remained HD stable but since pt lost her remaining IV (from
pulling at the IVs) she had to have a PICC placed after the IV
team failed to place another PIV.
- GI were consulted and recommended angiography or a bleeding
scan since this likely would identify the source.  This was
discussed at length with HCP (by house staff, geriatrics
attending, GI, radiology) and HCP ultimately decided against any
procedures at all including colonoscopy, bleeding scan and
angiography
- at the time of discharge the plan was to transfuse prn to keep
hct>30 and to check hct q3 days, unless she re-bleeds
- she was stared on iron supplementation for anemia
- blood pressure medication was held at the time of d/c in order
to prevent hypotension if she bleeds again.  diuretics were also
cut for this reason from lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] to 20mg qod
.
# UTI
- urine on admission grew out pan-sensitive proteus mirabilis
- pt was treated with 3 day course of cipro which should be
completed at rehab
.
# Parox Atrial fibrillation
- not on anticoagulation no ASA given GIB
- stable without rate/rhythm control (not on as outpt)
.
# CAD s/p MI
- held ASA given GIB and not started on d/c given risks of fatal
bleed outweights the benefits of preventing stroke, MI
- not on BB, statin due to limited long-term benefit in this pt
(and BB may be fatal if re-bleeds)
.
Chronic CHF with EF>60%
- BB, nitro were held at the time of d/c in order to prevent
hypotension if she bleeds again.  diuretics were also cut for
this reason from lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] to 20mg qod
