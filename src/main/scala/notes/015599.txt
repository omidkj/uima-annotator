Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]
Chief Complaint:
Intentional overdose of tizanidine

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:

HPI: Per MICU, psychiatry and outside chart notes, and brief
history from pt, this is a 19 yo F with PMH of chronic back pain
presents after overdose. She reportedly took 45-60 Tabs (each
4mg) of tizanidine (approx. 160 mg) around 11 am on [**2127-10-19**]
after a breakup with her boyfriend.
.
She was prescribed tizanidine earlier this year for back pain
and biofeedback was recommended, which she evidently has not
been impressed with, feeling that her pain has a physiologic
origin. To the original admitting team, she stated that she
deals with chronic pain for years and wanted all her pain to go
away. She also told the ED team she might do it again. She said
that she took the pills and then called her mother to say
goodbye. She says she did not want help, she just wanted to say
goodbye.
.
Per prior notes, in the ED, her vitals initially were T96.2, BP
140/88, HR 56, RR 16, O2sat 97% RA. She was given charcoal in
the ED (no vomiting afterwards). She was also given 0.4mg narcan
with no effect, and then given 2mg narcan which brought her HR
up from 50 to 88 and her BP down from systolic 140 to 110s.
Toxicology was consulted in the ED and said she would be at risk
for bradycardia, hypertension and AV block along with
respiratory depression. She was admitted to the MICU for close
monitoring. Overnight there were no events, and she is
transferred to the medicine floor pending admission to [**Hospital1 **]
4 for inpatient psychiatric treatment.
.
On our exam in the MICU prior to transfer to the medicine floor,
she was minimally communicative, but said she simply felt
"stupid." She did not affirm any type of discomfort or pain or
other symptoms. She denied current suicidal ideation and said
that she had not had suicide attempts prior, though she did have
prior feelings of "wanting it all to go away." Besides her back
pain she denied any other significant medical history.
