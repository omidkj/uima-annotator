Very briefly, this is a 40-year-old female with a history of
HIV, CD4 account around 1, and self-reported high viral load
presently with hepatitis B and hepatitis C, asthma, history
of bacterial endocarditis, and active polysubstance abuse
including alcohol, smoking crack, and shooting up with
heroin.  She is homeless and lives occasionally at her
sister's place.

According to patient her primary care physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) 7474**] at the [**Hospital1 756**] Home, whom she last saw on [**5-/2181**], but
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7474**] had left.  She was admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**] Intensive Care Unit on
[**2181-9-18**] after she presented to [**Last Name (un) 33912**] Detox Facility and
was found to have a low blood pressure.

In brief, she was found to have endocarditis and CMV viremia.
She was treated appropriately with improvement of her
symptoms.  She was transferred out of the ICU onto the floor
on [**2181-9-23**] when the General Medicine team became involved
in her care.  We continued her on IV Oxacillin via her
peripherally inserted central catheter line as well as other
medicines.  She looked well.

The 24 to 36 hours she spent on 5 South were marked with
complaints about wanting to leave and smoke.  Despite the
staff's best attempts at watching her, she was noticed
missing on several occasions.  When she returned she was
asked repeatedly to stay on the floor and not to leave
without permission or notification of the nurse. She was
noted missing from her room last seen at approximately 2:40
p.m. on [**2181-9-24**].  The hospital security was notified, and
her family was called, but no one answered. The nurses were
instructed to contact Security if patient should return;
however, patient did not return and, hence, left the hospital
against medical advice.
