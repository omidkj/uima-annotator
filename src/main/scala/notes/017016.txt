Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1124**] was admitted from an outside hospital to the
cardiology service on [**2121-6-10**] for a pre-operative work-up and
plavix wash-out.  He was treated with antibiotics for a urinary
tract infection. On [**6-11**] an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed
in the cath lab for angina at rest, and then brought to the
operative room where aortic valve replacement(21mm CE Magna
Aortic Pericardial), mitral valve replacement (27mm [**Company 1543**]
Mosaic Mitral Porcine), coronary artery bypass grafting times
three (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM1, SVG to L PDA) were performed.
Please see operative note for details.

 He was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit with
severe metabolic acidosis and hypoxia. He was atrial paced for
an underlying junctional rhythm and occasional atrial
fibrillation for which he was placed on amiodarone.  He
stabilized on multiple pressors and the acidosis resolved.  He
improved hemodynamically and pressors were slowly weaned and
discontinued. On post-operative day three his balloon was
removed.

A dropping platelet leveldeveloped and a HIT panel was sent
(which was positive) and he was placed on argatroban.  He
developed post-operative acute renal failure.  Lightening of
sedation on post-operative day four revealed arousability to
voice and opening of eyes but not following commands.  Tube
feeds were begun on post-operative day five. The Hematology
service was [**Company 4221**] and argatroban was started with coumadin
overlap when his platelets recovered to 150,000. Coumadin was
recommended for 3 months unless thrombosis was documented for
which coumadin would be recommended for 6 months. Mr. [**Known lastname 1124**] was
extubated on [**2121-6-20**] after aggressive diuresis, however, he
developed a respiratory acidosis, became lethargic and confused
and required reintubation. Tube feeds were resumed for
nutritional support. He had a bump in his liver enzymes and his
statin and tube feeds were held. An abdominal ultrasound was
negative and his enzymes improved, allowing resumption of his
tube feeds.

Physical therapy was [**Date Range 4221**] to work with his range of motion
and strength recovery. A large left pleural effusion was noted
on chest x-ray and a chest tube was placed successfully draining
1600cc's for serousanguinous fluid. (Subsequently a right CT was
placed for a 3liter effusion.)

The wound care nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] for early signs of a coccyx
ulcer. Pressure relief measures were taken as well as skin
barrier creams to protect skin from stool. Mr. [**Known lastname 1124**] was
remained intolerant to several weaning attempts of his
ventilator. The general surgery service was [**Known lastname 4221**] and on
[**2121-7-1**] placed a tracheostomy and feeding tube at the bedside.
He developed low grade fevers and a blood culture was
significant for coagulase negative staph. Vancomycin and zosyn
were started. A PICC line was placed in interventional radiology
for access. Argatroban and Coumadin were restarted for atrial
fibrillation and his HIT positive status. A right-sided chest
tube was placed for a pleural effusion.  He was seen in
consultation by psychiatry after request by his daughter for
depression.  They recommended haldol as needed for anxiety and
avoiding benzodiazepines and anticholinergics.

With drainage of effusions and improved nutrritional status he
began to tolerate brief periods of trach collar.  Digoxin was
added to his regimen for ventricular rate control and
betablockers were added, amiodarone was continued.  A digoxin
level was 0.6 on [**7-12**].

His CXR on [**7-12**] demonstated well expanded lungs, without
effusion. Vancomycin is to be continued through [**7-17**].

He was transferred to a rehabilitation facility for continued
ventilator weaning and recovery.  He remains neurologically
intact with stable chemistries.
