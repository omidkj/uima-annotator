.
ECG: ST @ 105/min w/1st degree HB (PR 188) and lateral ST
depression increased since prior
.
CTA: acute pulmonary emboli in the pulmonary arteries to the
right upper and right lower lobes. unchanged lung mets in the
left lower lobe, right upper lobes. new right pleural effusion.

.
TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (ejection fraction 30-40 percent) secondary
to hypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior free wall,
posterior wall, and lateral wall. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2135-12-12**], the left ventricular ejection fraction
appears somewhat further reduced with more extensive regional
wall motion abnormalities (but the ejction fraction may have
been overestimated on the prior report).
.
LENIS b/l: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
82M w/ CHF, CAD, HTN, DM, stage IV NSCLC admitted to MICU with
RUL, RLL [**Hospital 35797**] transferred to medicine on heparin gtt, started on
coumadin and levo/flagyl for post-obstructive PNA.
.
1. PE- Found to have large PEs in RUL and RLL. LENIS were
negative. Predisposing factor is metastatic lung CA. This
patient has multiple poor prognostic factors for this PE,
including initially elevated troponin, decreased cardiac
function on TTE compared to ten days prior, and strain on ECG.
However, he gradually improved and was transferred from the MICU
to the medicine floor while being heparinized with a continuous
drip. Patient remained stable on 2L oxygen after transfer.
Coumadin 5 mg qHS was started on [**12-24**] with an INR goal of 2.0 to
3.0. Patient was switched to lovenox on [**12-25**] in order to bridge
him until his INR is in the therapeutic range. Heparin drip was
discontinued. INR was 1.2 on day of discharge. Patient was given
a prescription for one week supply of Lovenox which should be
sufficient to reach therapeutic goal on Coumadin. He has a close
followup appointment with his PCP in order to check the INR
after discharge.
.
2. Pleural Effusion- CTA showed thick rind around the left
pleural surface, most likely representing malignant pleural
disease. In addition, a new small right pleural effusion was
detected. While PE can cause effusion, most likely
re-accumulation secondary to malignancy. Pain over old
pleurodesis site was controlled with IV and PO narcotics.
Patient was discharged on Tylenol and PO Dilaudid PRN pain which
optimally suppressed his symptoms. He has a followup with
oncology as an outpatient on [**12-29**].
.
3. Postobstructive Pneumonia: LLL opacity found on chest CT.
Given productive cough, it was considered to represent a
postobstructive pneumonia. Patient was started on Levo/flagyl
for at total course of 14 days. His abx were initiated on [**12-25**].
He should continue both abx as an outpatient for an additional
12 days. Blood cutures from [**12-22**] were pending upon discharge.
Sputum cultures could not be obtained.
.
4. NSCLC- Stage IV. Given current situation, not a candidate for
therapy. Patient has a followup appointment with oncology.
.
5. CAD- s/p stent LAD 04/[**2131**]. CEs were initially elevated in
the MICU but were trending down consistently from 0.28 - 0.23 -
0.19 - 0.07. Elevations most likely reflected CRI and cardiac
strain in setting of PE rather than active ischemia. In
addition, patient was already on a heparin drip as part of his
PE management. Patient was restarted on short-acting BB on [**12-24**]
(with equivalent dose of his long-acting outpatient BB). ASA was
continued throughout his hospital stay.
.
6. Microcytic anemia- Baseline 30-36. Remained stable throughout
hospital course. Low iron, high ferritin and low TIBC were in
line with ACD.
.
7. CHF- Worsening function (EF 30-40%) likely secondary to PE.
Should improve once PEs are resolving. Patient was continued on
his ISDN. He was also restarted on his BB, Lasix, and CCB once
one the medicine floor. Prior discharge he was also started on a
low dose of an ACEI. His CCB can be increased to his initial
outpatient dose after discharge. The ACEI should be titrated up
as needed.
.
8. HTN- Normotensive on transfer.  Antihypertensives were
initially held in the ICU given the large PEs. Patient was
stepwise restarted on his BB, Lasix, and a lower dose of his
CCB. See also above.
.
9. CRI- Baseline Cr 1.2 to 2.5. Cr remained around baseline
throughout this hospital stay.
.
10. DMII- Diet controlled at home. Patient was on RISS.

.
11. FEN- House diet, repleted lytes PRN.
.
12. PPx- Initially heparin drip, then Lovenox/Coumadin.
.
13. Code- Discussed poor prognosis in the context of metastatic
cancer and large PEs. Patient wanted to remain full code. Social
work was consulted.
