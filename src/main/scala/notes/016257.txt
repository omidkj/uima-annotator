PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  The patient was lethargic, but arousable and able
to answer questions.
VITAL SIGNS:  At the time of admission to the CCU, her vitals
were as follows:  Temperature 97.6??????, blood pressure 130/70,
pulse of 50, oxygen saturation of 88% on 100% nonrebreather.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Dry oral mucosa.
RESPIRATORY:  She had bilateral crackles approximately [**2-2**]
the way up.
CARDIAC:  Her rhythm was irregular and she was noted to be
bradycardic.  No murmurs.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.  She is obese, but soft, nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  Trace edema bilaterally.
NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves III through XII were grossly
intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY STUDIES:  White cell count 12.3,
hematocrit 29.8, platelets 265.  PT 12.9, INR 1.1, PTT 24.5.
Sodium 134, potassium 3.3, chloride 104, bicarbonate 19, BUN
42, creatinine 1.5, glucose 204, calcium 8.4, phosphate 5.7,
magnesium 2.4.  Arterial blood gases 7.28, 37, 190 on 100%
nonrebreather.  She also had a transaminitis with ALT 126,
AST 51, alkaline phosphatase 225, total bilirubin 0.6.
Lithium level was noted to be 2.4, therapeutic range 0.5 to
1.5.

IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at a
rate of 36, PR intervals 186.  QTC was prolonged at 560.
Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema with increased vascularity
in the upper lung fields.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, the
patient was noted to be in sinus bradycardia with a heart
rate in the 30s and 40s and hemodynamically unstable with
diastolic blood pressure falling from 100 to the 60s with
decreased responsiveness.  She was given 2.5 mg of Atropine
without effect and that was followed by 1 mg of epinephrine.
She responded to the epinephrine by going into sinus
tachycardia with a heart rate greater than 120.  She
developed chest pain and inferior lateral ST depression.  She
subsequently went into a junctional rhythm at a rate of 50
with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  Dopamine was
started a temporary ventricular pacer was placed.  She was
then admitted to the CCU team for further management.
Summary of her hospital course is as follows:

1.  LITHIUM INTOXICATION:  Lithium was held and the patient
was hydrated with hypotonic saline.  During the
hospitalization, gentle diuresis with Lasix was required to
maintain volume balance and the lithium level fell from 2.4
to less than 0.2.  After consultation with the outpatient
psychiatrist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16471**], the decision was made not to
restart the patient on lithium at this time.

2.  CARDIAC:  The patient was evaluated by the
electrophysiology service during this hospitalization.
Dopamine was weaned immediately after placement of the
ventricular pacer.  The temporary ventricular pacer was
changed to an atrial pacer on [**2123-10-14**] for increased
stability.  This was then removed [**2123-10-18**].  Since the patient
was not to be restarted on lithium and she was
hemodynamically stable, the decision was made not to put in a
permanent pacer at this time.  Given her electrocardiogram
changes and chest pain after admission after the
administration of epinephrine.  Her enzymes were cycled and
she was ruled out by enzymes.  Echocardiogram indicated
normal ejection fraction of 60% to 65% with a moderately
dilated LA, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and mild
tricuspid regurgitation.

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient related a four year
history of diarrhea worsening just prior to admission.  This
was discussed with the primary physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**].
Stool studies were sent and she will have an outpatient work
up to be coordinated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**].  The transaminitis at the
time of admission with the exception of alkaline phosphatase
spontaneously resolved with hydration and was most likely
secondary to her hemodynamic instability at the time of
admission.  The alkaline phosphatase will be rechecked as an
outpatient by her primary care physician.

4.  RENAL:  With hydration, her BUN and creatinine returned
to baseline status.

5.  PSYCHIATRY:  The patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of
the consult service and discussed with her outpatient
psychiatrist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16471**].  The decision was made to avoid
lithium at this time.  Instead, she will be discharged on
Risperdal 2 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Klonopin 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
with an atypical antipsychotic most likely to be started in
the future as an outpatient.  Outpatient care will be
coordinated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16471**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Accupril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Zocor 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Synthroid 150 mcg p.o. q.d.
5.  Micronase 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Risperdal 2 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7.  Klonopin 0.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Lithium intoxication

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital 16506**] Health and Rehabilitation at [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 110006**] in stable
condition.
