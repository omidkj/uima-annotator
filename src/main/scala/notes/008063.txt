Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 3646**] is a 58 year old man with a history of cryptogenic
cirrhosis most likely secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
who was admitted for an elective TIPS procedure on [**2167-7-31**] for
esophageal varices and history of refractory ascites. His course
was complicated by hepatorenal syndrome and a MICU stay.
.
#.Hypotension: Hypotensive to 80's/40's starting at 5:30
[**2167-9-4**].  A STAT HCT was checked and was 22 from 26.  His INR
had bumped to 3.3 from 1.9.  He was given a unit of FFP and a
unit of blood.  SICU was notified at 7am. Blood cultures, u/a,
urine culture were all drawn.  Chest X-ray was done.  He
remained hypotensive, so we broadened his coverage with
vancomycin (he was on Zosyn and Fluconazole).  a repeat HCT was
drawn and found to be 20.  His INR after the FFP was 3.4.  He
was given 1.5L of NS, 500cc of albumin, and 1 unit of blood and
a second unit was being given.  He had diagnostic paracentesis
that was hemorrhagic bilaterally and negative for SBP. His
pressures continued to remain in the 80's/40's despite fluid
resuscitation. MICU evaluated.  Concern for sepsis vs.
intra-abdominal bleed from prior paracentesis. He was monitored
closely and transferred to the SICU. He was afebrile and
mentating well prior to transfer, though he was lethargic.
.
#.S/P TIPS: Pt with NASH cirrhosis, c/b esophageal variceal
hemorrhage in distant past, refractory ascites, now s/p
successful TIPS. His immediate post-TIPS Hct was down to 20 from
baseline 25; he received 2 units and had an appropriate
response. The patient had a -10L paracentesis on [**8-1**] and a -11L
paracentesis on [**8-3**]. Albumin was repleted post procedures.
.
#Altered Mental status: Mr. [**Known lastname 3646**] was transferred to the MICU on
[**8-8**] for worsening mental status s/p TIPs; he had been on
lactulose and rifaximin throughout his hospitalization without
improvement. Of note, this was thought to be encephalopathy s/p
TIPS rather than infection, given that he was afebrile and on
ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis. A diagnostic paracentesis on
transfer to the MICU was negative.    For his altered mental
status, he received several doses of haldol on the night of
transfer to MICU after a code purple was called for him.
Lactulose and rifaxamin were continued to goal BM 4x/day. Was
intubated [**8-11**] for concern for worsening respiratory status for
2 days, and RIJ cnetral line and PICC were placed, extubated on
[**8-12**].  After extubation, mental status improved with large
stools [**2-17**] lactulose. On return to the medicine floor her was
A+Ox3 and conversational.
.
#Hepatorenal syndrome:  Mr. [**Known lastname 3646**] had worsening renal function
in setting of his liver disease and was being treated with
Octreotide, Midodrine and Albumin. Creatinine worsened during
stay in the unit but had improved his on the floor and
