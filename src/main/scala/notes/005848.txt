was at a mother's day picnic 2 days prior to admission, and a
family friend who is [**Name8 (MD) **] RN inquired about her cough (wet but

PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was evaluated by a NP[**MD Number(3) 18184**] [**Hospital3 **] and found
to be more lethargic than usual, and vital signs revealed BP

evaluation of possible pneumonia. In the ED, she was febrile to
100.8 rectally, BP 107/60, HR 80, and SpO2 97% (? if on RA or

EKG: Sinus bradycardia. Prolonged P-R interval. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

Radiology
[**4-29**] CXR: No prior comparisons. Heart, lungs, and mediastinum
are within normal limits for the patient's age.

[**4-30**] CXR: Pulmonary vascular congestion has developed, heart
size remains normal. There is no pulmonary edema and pleural
effusion, if any, is minimal, on the right. There is no focal
pulmonary abnormality. Enlargement of the hila could be due to
vascular congestion.

[**5-1**] CXR: Interval development of small bilateral pleural
effusions with possible subpulmonic component on the left side.
Increased retrocardiac opacity - etiologies include atelectasis
versus aspiration pneumonitis/early pneumonia. Repeat radiograph
is recommended to assess for change.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old female w/ dementia and Parkinson's disease admitted
[**2138-4-29**] to ICU with lethargy, fever, hypoxia (85% RA). Her chest
X-ray was without infiltrate, although urinalysis was positive
(started on ceftriaxone). Her respiratory status rapidly
improved (95% RA) and she was transferred to the general medical
floor.

1) Septicemia due to UTI: The patient was covered with
ceftriaxone. Urine culture (?collected after antibiotics) was
negative although urinalysis markedly positive. A follow-up
urinalysis with decreasing pyuria and no leukocyte
esterase/nitrite, suggesting improving infection. She was
discharged on cefpodoxime to complete a 10 day course. Blood
cultures had no growth to date at time of discharge.

2) Hypoxia/Pneumonia: Although initial CXR was without
infiltrate, subsequent images showed a retrocardiac infiltrate
(see results section). The patient will complete a 5 day course
of azithromycin in addition to the cefpodoxime as above. The
patient's O2 sat remained stable on the floor, 95% on RA.
Legionella urine antigen was negative. She underwent a speech
and swallow evaluation and was started on a ground solid and
nectar thickened liquids.

3) Dementia: The patient was continued on Aricept and Namenda.

4) Parkinson's disease: The patient was continued on her home
dose of carbidopa/levodopa

5) HTN: HCTZ and Atenolol were initially held given relative
hypotension (sbp 110s off meds). These were restarted over the
course of her hospital stay, as the patient's blood pressure
stabilized.

6) Ostoeoporosis: The patient was continued on calcium/vitamin
D; fosamax weekly

7) Anemia: At time of discharge, the patient's hematocrit was
stable at 33.1 from 37. Iron studies/vitamin B12/folate were not
consistent with deficiency. Further work-up can be pursued as an
outpatient at the discretion of the patient's PCP.
