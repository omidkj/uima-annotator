Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 80yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, systolic CHF, aortic
stenosis, Afib, DVT, and pulmonary fibrosis who presents with
hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and hypoxia.

He went to pulmonary clinic today with hemoptysis.  He has had
intermittent hemoptysis for about 2.5 weeks.  It has been
gradually increasing in severity, initially mild but now
moderate.  Today he coughed up 1 teaspoon every few hours.
Denies fever/chills, but endorses increasing O2 requirement.
Typically he only wears O2 at night but now has been wearing it
during the day due to desats to the 80's.  Also reports
decreased peak flows on his spirometer.  Denies changes in
weight recently.  Denies peripheral edema or orthopnea.  Denies
PND.  Denies chest pain.

In the ED, initial VS were 99.5 90 95/61 18 97% 2L. On exam, pt
has no tachypnea but does have bibasal crackles. HR is
irregular, and no JVD or edema appreciated. Labs revealed INR
3.4 and BNP elevated at 3789. No elev WBC, no bands and Cr of
1.7 (Cr 1.6 in [**3-/2150**]) was noted. CXR showed evidence of RUL
pneumonia. EKG showed A. fib, 90, left axis deviation, no STEMI.
TnT was neg. Pt was given Aspirin 325 and Lasix 40 mg IV to
which he diruresed 1L. Pt then received 1L NS bolus for SBP 80s.
BP now 102. Bld cx and urine cx were sent. Antibiotics for
community acquired pneumonia were started (CTX/Azithro). Pt had
no hemoptysis while in ED. and resp status remained stable. PE
was considered but CTA was not done due to creatinine of 1.7,
discussed this with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  On transfer, VS were 99.2 92 18
97/60 94% 4l.  Given 3L fluid total.

Reports:

ECG [**2150-7-30**]: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular
response. Left axis deviation. Non-specific intraventricular
conduction delay. There are Q waves in the inferior leads
consistent with myocardial infarction. There is a late
transition in the anterior leads consistent with possible prior
anterior wall myocardial infarction. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2149-6-19**] atrial
fibrillation has replaced sinus rhythm and the QRS duration is
longer.

CXR [**2150-7-30**]: 1. New patchy opacity within the periphery of the
right upper lung field concerning for an infectious process.
Followup radiographs after interval treatment are recommended to
ensure resolution of this finding. 2. Pulmonary fibrosis. 3.
Interval vertebroplasty of multiple compression deformities
within the thoracic and lumbar spine.

LENIs [**2150-7-31**]: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either
leg.

CT Chest [**2150-7-31**]: 1. New diffuse bilateral ground glass
opacities superimposed upon underlying pulmonary fibrosis. The
differential diagnosis is broad including hemorrhage, widespread
infection (including PCP or viral pneumonia), acute exacerbation
of underlying interstitial pneumonia, and asymmetric edema. 2.
Pulmonary fibrosis with a basal predominance which is
incompletely assessed on this CT. 3. Pulmonary artery
enlargement suggests underlying pulmonary hypertension but this
finding has lower specificity for hypertension in the setting of
diffuse interstitial lung disease. 4. Multiple thoracic
vertebral compression fractures some of which have progressed
from CXR of [**2149-6-19**]. 5. Extensive atherosclerotic
disease.

TTE [**2150-8-1**]: Mildly dilated left ventricle with severely reduced
left ventricular systolic function. Moderately dilated and
depressed right ventricle. At least moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation, directed posteriorly. Moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
80yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, systolic CHF, aortic stenosis,
Afib, DVT, and pulmonary fibrosis who presents with hemoptysis,
shortness of breath, and hypoxia.

#. Hemoptysis/Hypoxia: On admission there was a wide
differential diagnosis for his hemoptysis including pneumonia,
PE, CHF/MR, bronchiectasis, DAH, or trauma.  He was initially
treated for CAP with ceftriaxone/doxycycline, although he did
not have elevated WBC or fevers.  He underwent CT chest which
showed bilateral ground glass opacities that could represent
hemorrhage, infection, interstitial pneumonia, or edema.  He
then underwent bronch which showed some bloody secretions
potentially consistent with DAH vs infection vs bland bleed in
the setting of ILD.  He was started on prednisone for worsening
lung disease. He had a TTE on [**2150-8-1**] that showed worsening of
his LVEF to 20-25% and worsening MR, and he was transferred to
the CCU team for further management.

#. Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine 1.7 on admission
which improved with diuresis and medical management.

#. Hypotension: He had blood pressures in the 80s/50's while
mentating well with good urine output.  These values were felt
to be close to his baseline blood pressures.

#. Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  In Afib with rates 100's on
admission.  He was continued on his home dronedarone and
metoprolol.

#. acute on chronic systolic CHF: He was diuresed with IV lasix
for volume overload as above and his hypoxia mildly improved.

#. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 96 from baseline of 140-150 on
admission.  They remained stable during his stay.

#. CAD s/p CABG: No ECG changes to suggest ischemia on
admission.  He was continued on his home beta blocker, statin,
and aspirin.

#. Hyperlipidemia: Continued on his home statin

#. H/o post-herpetic neuralgia: Home pregabalin
