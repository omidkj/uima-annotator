Service:  LIVER TRANSPLANT SURGERY SERVICE


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  End stage liver disease with worsening
renal failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50 year-old
male with history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, referred to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for transplant evaluation. He presented on the day
prior to admission for pretransplant laboratories and was
noted to have an elevated potassium of 6.1 and acute renal
failure with a creatinine of 4.8. The patient had received a
large volume 5 liter paracentesis the week prior to
presentation. Baseline creatinine was 1 to 1.3. He had been
in his usual state of health but did note mild upper
respiratory infection symptoms over the preceding days
including rhinorrhea, cough that was productive, and general
malaise.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hepatitis C cirrhosis
diagnosed in [**2154**], etiology unknown. Denied history of blood
transfusion, IV drug use, or homosexual contacts. HIV
negative, CMV IgG positive, toxo negative and EBV/HSV that
was pending.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives in [**Location 10022**], Mass with his mother and
brother. [**Name (NI) **] tobacco. History of 2 to 3 beers per night, quit
5 years prior to admission when he was diagnosed with
hepatitis C virus.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of bone cancer. Mother recently
diagnosed with lung cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature maximum 97.3,
heart rate 62, blood pressure 89/66, respiratory rate 18, 96%
on room air. Patient appeared jaundiced, resting comfortably
in bed. Scleral icterus. Dry mucous membranes. Negative
jugular venous distension. No lymphadenopathy. Cardiac with
distant heart sounds, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs,
regurgitation, gallop. Lungs: Scattered expiratory wheezes
with coarse breath sounds. Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds,
distended but tense. Tender to palpation of the site of
paracentesis in the left lower quadrant with ecchymosis at
that site, no rebound, no guarding. Extremities: No edema.
Neurologic: Alert and oriented. Answered questions
appropriately. Positive asterixis.

Over the course of this hospital stay his renal function
worsened with creatinine up to 6. He was managed with
octreotide and midodrine for the month of [**Month (only) 404**] with slowly
increasing creatinine. Urine output was approximately 500 to
700 cc per day. Diuretics were held in the setting of acute
renal failure. He received lactulose t.i.d. and then
underwent paracentesis approximately 4 to 5 days throughout
the month of [**Month (only) 404**] requiring fresh frozen plasma prior to
each tap. The transplant service was consulted for transplant
work up and on [**2159-2-27**] he was taken to the operating
room for liver and kidney transplant from a deceased donor.
Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Co-surgeon was Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Assistant was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]. Estimated blood loss
was 3.5 liters. Please see operative reports for further
details. He received induction and immunosuppression with 500
mg of Solu-Medrol, CellCept 1 gram intraoperatively. He
received Vancomycin and Zosyn for prophylactic antibiotics.
He was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for
postoperative recovery. He was intubated. Pathology report on
the native liver demonstrated established cirrhosis,
tricombed vein was evaluated. There was mild to moderate
septal mononuclear cell inflammation with mild lobular
component, grade 2 inflammation. No fatty changes were noted.
Negative vascular and biliary margins. Autolyzed gallbladder
with mild chronic inflammation with focal bile duct hamartoma
and no iron seen on the special stain. Postoperative day #1
renal ultrasound and liver ultrasound demonstrated hepatic
and portal veins patent with normal directional flow. The
inferior vena cava was patent as were the main, right and
left hepatic arteries. The kidney transplant demonstrated
unremarkable Doppler ultrasound with resistive indices within
normal limits. The nephrology service followed along closely
making recommendations throughout this hospital course. He
had 3 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12828**]. Liver function tests increased
initially with an AST of 378, ALT of 286 and alkaline
phosphatase of 49 with a  total bilirubin of 8.9. These
trended down for the remainder of the hospital course to a
low of AST of 52, ALT of 154, alkaline phosphatase 120 and
total bilirubin of 1.7. His creatinine preoperatively was
6.6. This decreased to 0.9 on postoperative day 4. He had
excellent urine output of approximately 1500 cc of per day.
Two of the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drains, the lateral and medial, were
discontinued. The third [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] remained in place for
fairly large output of approximately 520 cc. The hematocrit
decreased to 26.6 on postoperative day 3. He received 1 units
of packed red blood cells. Hematocrit remained fairly stable
between 31.5 and 35.2. Platelet count decreased to 56 on
postoperative day 2 and gradually increased to 1.2 on
postoperative day 9. Prograf was started on postoperative day
2 to 2 mg b.i.d. The Prograf level increased to 16.7. At this
time the Prograf was decreased to 1.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. and
levels were monitored daily. On postoperative day 7 his
Prograf level increased to 13.5. Prograf was held for 2 doses
and then resumed at 1 mg p.o. b.i.d. Vital signs were stable
throughout this hospital course. He was afebrile. Blood
pressure ranged between 121/93 to 141/95. He had resolution
of his generalized edema. His weight preoperatively was 81
kilos. This decreased down to 71.7 on postoperative day 9.

On postoperative day 3 Mr. [**Known lastname 65401**] complained of severe left
ear pain and blockage that had started 2 days prior to his
transplant surgery. He described the pain as being underwater
in a pool. He also complained of tinnitus that was constant
for the prior 4 days. He also noted diminished hearing for
approximately 4 days and he felt somewhat dizzy. Ear, nose
and throat was consulted. Findings included bilateral ear
helix/tragus without evidence of inflammation or infection.
There was no pain on palpation or retraction of the ears, no
drainage from the ear canals. The left ear the external
auditory canal had a small amount of ecchymosis at the 6
o'clock position but no evidence of cellulitis or
obstruction. The tympanic membrane appeared grossly normal
and was mobile. Right ear was normal. [**Doctor Last Name 11586**] was unreliable
but possibly lateralized to the right. The [**Doctor First Name **] was A graded
and B on the right and B equaling A on the left.
Recommendations included Afrin spray and Sudafed to
decongest. A sinus CT was done. Non-contrast CT of the
sinuses were done. This demonstrated opacification of the
probably atelectatic left maxillary sinus. These findings
were not felt to be the cause of the patient's left ear pain.
He received Sudafed with some relief and also Afrin with fair
relief of the left ear pain. Vancomycin was stopped. It was
felt that patient had left sided conductive hearing loss
secondary to middle ear effusion, but a sensorineural hearing
loss could not be ruled out at that time. Patient had been
receiving IV Vancomycin and the possibility of a drug
ototoxicity was raised. Formal audiogram was recommended to
test all frequency ranges. Patient continued to complain of
left ear pain and deafness for the remainder of the hospital
course and he medicated with p.o. Dilaudid with fairly
acceptable relief of discomfort.

The patient's blood sugars ranged between 122 to 149. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained and the patient received sliding
scale insulin to achieve normalization of blood sugars.

Physical therapy followed the patient throughout the hos
