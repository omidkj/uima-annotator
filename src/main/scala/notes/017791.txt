respiratory distress

History of Present Illness:
73 year old man with history of HIV (last CD4 [**12-20**], VL<48, on
HAART), COPD, dCHF, a fib, PE on coumadin presents with 4 days
of increasing SOB and cough with green sputum. His symptoms have
been going on for about 4 days. He denied any fevers, chills,
sweats. He also denied any chest pain, nausea, vomitting. He did
report acute on chronic abdominal pain, which has had an
extensive and negative outpatient work up. Of note, he was
recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] in early [**2113-3-10**] for UTI,
superficial ulcer. Because his symptoms worsened over time, he
developed
.
In the ED, the patient presented with the following vital signs:
96.8   147/70   94   34   96%12L NRB. He was thought to be
initially with acute COPD was given 500cc NS and duonebs when he
became acutely dyspneic and was thought to have acute pulmonary
edema. He was given nitro SL to no avail. He was given nitro
paste again with no significant help. He then was given lasix
20mg IV ONCE but made no urine from this. He then was given
nitro gtt, which per ED resident seemed to help him, as did
bipap. He was given morphine for abdominal pain and respiratory
distress. He was also given levofloxacin 750mg IV ONCE,
azithromycin 500mg PO ONCE, ceftriaxone 1gm IV ONCE. His last
set of vitals were 67  111/76   21   98% on CPAP FIO2 60, PEEP
of 10.

CXR on admission:
IMPRESSION: Given profound low lung volumes, it is difficult to
definitively diagnose a superimposed acute process above the
extensive linear reticular scarring seen at the lung bases.
Conceivably, there may be a superimposed consolidation at the
left lung base although this is not entirely clear. If clinical
management is dependent on determination, consider repeat x-ray
or CT for further characterization.
INDICATION: History of HIV, intubated in ICU for respiratory
failure.

COMPARISON: CT available from [**2113-3-13**] and [**2112-12-22**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired 5-mm axial images of the chest were
obtained without the use of IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal
reformations were performed at 5-mm slice thickness. 1.25-mm
axial reconstructions were also obtained for further evaluation
of the pulmonary parenchyma.

FINDINGS: Again seen is severe centrilobular emphysema with
paraseptal blebs, the largest measuring 21 mm in diameter
located at the right base (3:32).  There is increased
ground-glass opacity and atelectasis within the right upper and
middle lobes, partially obscuring a right upper lobe mass (3:22)
better seen on prior examinations. Increased septal thickening,
predominantly at the lung bases (3:34) are reflective of
mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, worse since the [**2113-3-13**]
examination. A left lower lobe consolidation (3:37) is new.
Trace bilateral pleural effusions are present. The heart is
mildly enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion. The great
vessels are normal in caliber, re-demonstrating mild
atherosclerotic calcifications. Crescentic narrowing of the
trachea is reflective of tracheomalacia.
Prominent prevascular nodes measure up to 9 mm in diameter
(2:17), increased since the prior examination. Other scattered
axillary lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for
lymphadenopathy.
Included views of the upper abdomen demonstrate transesophageal
catheter
terminating within the stomach lumen. Non-contrast enhanced
images of the
liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, small splenule
(2:43), and
adrenal glands are normal.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Increase in right upper and middle lobe atelectasis and
diffuse
mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
4. Spiculated right upper lobe nodule, obscured by neighboring
atelectasis
and edema, better appreciated on the [**2113-3-13**] examination,
remains
concerning for neoplasm.
