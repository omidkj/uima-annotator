Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
"not feeling well"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line placement


History of Present Illness:
56 YO F with DM1 c/b multiple episodes of DKA, polyneuropathy
and gastroparesis, HCV genotype 1A, [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease, and
hypertension who presented with elevated blood sugars at home
along with nausea, [**Doctor Last Name **] and abdominal pain per ED triage.
She states that she has been compliant with meds and is unsure
of what exacerbated the DKA. She has stomach pains and nausea
from gastroparesis and is on Reglan, but has not followed up
with GI.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, her VS were: 97.7 109 132/64 18 100%.
Exam was notable for an irritable female, who seemed "altered".
Labs were notable for WBC 14.3, glucose 853, a creat 1.6 from 1,
K 5.4, bicarb 12 and lactate 7.6. U/A was without WBCs, +
ketones. A CVL was attempted but the patient was combative. She
was given haldol and zofran. A PIV was placed and she was given
12u insulin, and 200cc NS but her IV infiltrated. Eventually a R
IJ CVL was placed and she was started on an insulin gtt at
12u/hr and given 1L NS. A CXR was done and showed decreased
aeration on the left as compared to the right lung fields
although no clear infiltrate or effusion and the patient was
rotated toward the right. VS prior to transfer to the ICU were:
115 120/78 17 100% RA.
.
Of note the patient has had a myriad of admissions for DKA,
usually in the setting of E coli UTIs. Her last admission was
complicated by an ESBL E coli UTI.
.

IMAGING
.
Chest x-ray, s/p CVL placement ([**2135-8-9**]):
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**7-5**], there has been
placement of a
right IJ catheter that extends to the mid portion of the SVC. No
evidence of pneumothorax or other acute cardiopulmonary disease.
.
Abdomen ultrasound ([**2135-8-10**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Sludge within the gall bladder, without son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence
for
cholecystitis.
2. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
3. Minimally complex cyst within the lower pole of the left
kidney, similar
to CT from [**2134-8-10**].

Brief Hospital Course:
# Type 1 Diabetes mellitus with DKA:  In the ED, a central
venous line was placed for access and the patient received an
insulin drip, IVF (>8L), and K+ repletion upon admission to the
ICU. There was no evidence of infection - clear CXR, urinalysis,
urine culture, and blood culture, with low grade fevers. No
localizing sx.  This episode was likely precipitated by med
non-adherence vs. gastroparesis flare, similar to her numerous
previous visits to [**Hospital1 18**] for the same issues. Her diet was
advanced, her anion gap closed, and the insulin drip was
discontinued. She was then started on her home regimen of
insulin, with continued FSs in the 200s-300s. Continued
abdominal pain after resolution of the DKA prompted an abdominal
U/S that showed sludge within the gall bladder, without
son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for cholecystitis, no evidence of
hydronephrosis, and minimally complex cyst within the lower pole
of the left kidney. (Overall findings similar to CT from [**8-10**], [**2134**].) Repeat urinalysis was unremarkable and cultures
were negative.  She was started on 14 units of lantus [**Hospital1 **], but
was eating poorly.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and recommended PM
lantus to be increased to 18 units, holding if FSBG < 80.  NS
IVF with K+ replacement was continued as needed, as the
decreased Cl- and continued [**Last Name (un) **] indicated further
dehydration.  Once her PO intake improved, her central line was
removed and she was discharged with immediate follow-up at
[**Last Name (un) **] for an adjustment of her insulin regimen.
.
# BP lability: In the MICU, she had asymptomatic hypertension to
systolic BP of 180s treated with metoprolol 5mg IVx2. Upon
reaching the floor, she triggered for BP of 70/dopp and this
[**Location (un) 1131**] was checked numerous times.  She then received a 500cc
