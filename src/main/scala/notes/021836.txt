Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90713**] was admitted to cardiac surgery for surgical evaluation
of her type A aortic dissection.  As she recently had a
prolonged admission for a congestive heart failure and is a
frail 82 year-old, it was felt that she would not tolerate what
would likely become a prolonged post-operative course.  She
progressively became hypotensive despite high doses of
neosynepherine.  A bedside echocardiogram revealed an increasing
pericardial effusion.  After multiple discussions with her
health care proxy and multiple family members, comfort measures
only were instituted.  She was given fentanyl and extubated.
She expired at 14:23 on [**2174-9-3**].
