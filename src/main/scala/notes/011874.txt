Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Vancomycin Hcl/D5w

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
anuria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
84 vent-dependent M with COPD, CHF, CAD, AS, afib, recent
prolonged hospitalization for CHF complicated by spontaneous
retroperitoneal hematoma, referred from vent facility for
fevers, altered mental status, and hypoxia/difficulty
ventilating, as well as anuria.
On the day prior to admission pt, was reportedly febrile,
hypoxic on his vent, and alternately agitated and lethargic.
Cultures were sent and pt received 2 units PRBCs on [**2192-6-28**] for
Hct 26, also kayexalate for K 6.1. Has grown VRE (E faecalis) in
blood cultures sent [**6-28**], for which he is on linezolid at [**Hospital1 **]
Care; sputum cultures have grown Enterbacter cloacae (sensitive
to imipenem, genta, tobra, and amikacin). He became anuric and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In ED, initial VS 99.2, 140/80, 85, ABG 7.04/97/60 after bagging
in ambulance. Labs remarkable for ARF with hyperkalemia, rx'd
with calcium, insulin + glucose, bicarb. Foley placed, pt
remained anuric; GU confirmed foley in decompressed bladder. CXR
showed opacified L hemithorax--started levo/vanc. Abd also
distended and tender. Surgery consulted and CT thorax obtained,
which showed large L pleural effusion, large ascites; surgery
did not think any acute surgical pathology. When returned from
CT, pt in afib/RVR to 190s.

-ASSIST/CON

CXR:
There has been interval near complete opacification of the left
hemithorax when compared to the previous exam. There is apparent
slight shift of the mediastinum to the left, indicating a
component of volume loss/collapse, possibly secondary to a mucus
plug. There is most likely an associated left-sided pleural
effusion. The right costophrenic angle has been clipped from the
film. The visualized right lung appears within normal limits.
The pulmonary vasculature within the right lung is within normal
limits. The tracheostomy tube and percutaneous gastrostomy tube
appear in unchanged positions.

CT Abd/Pelvis:
1. Resolving retroperitoneal hematoma extending along the left
posterior pararenal space inferiorly to the left groin.
2. Large left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis
and collapse of the left lower lobe. Small right-sided pleural
effusion.
3. Large amount of ascites and anasarca.
5. Mildly thickened loops of small bowel with evaluation limited
by ascites and lack of intravenous contrast. The appearance is
similiar to the prior examination. The findings are likely
secondary to anasarca. Ischemia cannot be completely excluded,
especially given the appearance of the heavily calcified SMA and
close clinical correlation is advised.

RUQ Ultrasound with doppler to assess portal vessels:
1. Significantly shrunken liver with nodular contour and
increased echogenicity consistent with cirrhosis. Significant
amount of ascites is also identified. The main portal vein and
hepatic veins demonstrate normal flow pattern.

2. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
84M with AS, CAD, COPD, vent dependent, now with likely
Acinetobacter VAP, also Enterecoccus bacteremia, and oliguric
renal failure
.
# Respiratory: Trach/vent dependent; continued ventilation to
keep Sats >90%. L >> R pleural effusion--L effusion was last
drained one month ago (3.5L removed) and has reaccumulated,
likely sympathetic from ascites. As long as able to oxygenate
well, would not drain urgently. Maintained COPD on alb/atro,
inhaled steroids, and continued methylprednisolone with plan to
taper.
.
# Cardiovascular: chronic problems include:
- [**Name (NI) 31196**] AS by last echo, so would avoid sudden volume
shifts as patient is likely very pre-load dependent
- afib--rate controlled with metoprolol
.
# Acute oliguric renal failure, oliguric: Cr bumped from 1.0 a
month ago to 2.0 three days ago and now up to 3.7. Urine lytes
showed FeNa 11%, most likely ATN according to renal consultant.
Renal team offered dialysis to patient's family, but explained
that with his other significant co-morbidities, dialysis would
not be likely to change his overall prognosis, and healthcare
proxy decided that dialysis would not be in keeping with
patient's wishes.
.
# GI: Ascites: pt is not known cirrhotic, so cause of cirrhosis
not clear, although his CHF and hypoalbuminemia. low albumin
state vs portal HTN. should have diagnostic tap in am (has not
had paracentesis before). Tense ascites have displaced his PEG,
contributing to the leak of bilious fluid from the PEG site and
most likely also contaminating the peritoneum. Not clear if this
was the source of Enterococcus bacteremia, but covered with Abx
as below.
- elevated AST/ALT--could be drug effect, infection, shock liver
as patient was reportedly hypotensive
- chemical pancreatitis--CT did not reveal pancreatitis
.
# ID--Reportedly febrile yesterday; WBC 14 with 91% polys,
cultures from OSH growing VRE in blood and Enterobacter in
sputum. Resent blood, urine, sputum cultures. For now, continue
ampicillin for Enterococcus; Enterobacter was sensitive to
imipenem (although not tested for meropenem) and aminoglycosides
but no others, will use meropenem since less seizure risk in
renal failure.
.
# Skin--breakdown on coccyx as well as upper back, and thin skin
on arms with tears and ecchymoses. [**Doctor First Name **]-Air bed, wound consult.
.
# Code--full, per daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 31197**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 31198**] [[**State 2690**]]); pt
has girlfriend who has been very involved in his care ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 14880**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1924**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31199**]). After several discussions of the futility
of additional interventions such as dialysis in the setting of
his numerous comorbidities and the low likelihood that he would
survive any surgery to address the dehisced PEG and peritonitis,
his family agreed he would want to focus the goals of his care
on comfort. He
