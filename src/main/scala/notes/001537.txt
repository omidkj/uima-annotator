History of Present Illness:
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension
.
History of Present Illness:
72F with a history of type II DM, ESRD on HD, GAVE, HTN, MR,
CAD, CHF w/ RV failure and seizure disorder with recent
hospitalization from [**5-5**] to [**6-3**] with culture negative sepsis
with MS change and c.diff colitis, who presents to the ED on
[**6-4**] for HD.  Pt was discharged on [**6-3**] and was due for her HD
today per her MWF schedule.  She was sent from rehab to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for HD due to her current diarrhea from c.diff colitis
and concerns about her volume status.  She was seen in the ED
then sent for HD with 2.5 fluid removed.  Prior to HD, in ED BP
131/76  RR 16  92% 4L.
.
Following her ultrafiltration, she returned to the ED for likely
discharge back to rehab.  However, both during HD and on return
to the ED, she was noted to be hypotensive, to as low as SBP
60s.  She received 2 L total IVF in ED with minimal response.
She had a RIJ placed for access.  Her BP has since been labile
and she has had BP to 67/42 with HR 89 at time of transfer to
the floor.  The only laboratory sent at the time of admission to
floor were CBC and chem 10.

Imaging:
Echo - The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. A secundum type atrial septal defect is
present. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT abdomen and pelvis -
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a moderate-to-large
left
effusion, simple in attenuation, increased in volume from the
prior study.
There is a small right pleural effusion, also increased since
the prior exam.
There is bilateral lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.
There are
coronary artery calcifications and calcifications of the aortic
valve.

The non-contrast appearance of the liver, gallbladder, spleen,
pancreas and
adrenal glands is unremarkable. The known enlarged common bile
duct is not
well assessed on this examination. The kidneys are atrophic.
There is no
hydronephrosis. A moderate amount of ascites is again seen.
There is no free
intra-abdominal air.

There is circumferential wall thickening of the colon, most
marked from the
cecum through the hepatic flexure. The transverse, descending,
and sigmoid
colon is not well distended though it may be thickened to a
lesser degree.
Small bowel loops are normal in caliber and appearance, without
evidence of
obstruction. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber, with
atherosclerotic
calcifications. Patency of the mesenteric vessels cannot be
assessed without
IV contrast; no air is seen within them. There is no mesenteric
or
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. There is extensive subcutaneous
edema
bilaterally, similar to that seen on the prior study. A 2.4 x
1.3 cm nodule
is seen in the subcutaneous fat of the left lower abdomen,
possibly related to
an injection.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: Oral contrast reaches the
rectum, which is
normal in appearance. There are calcifications of the uterine
vessels. The
bladder is likely collapsed and not well assessed. There is a
moderate-to-
large amount of free pelvic fluid, slightly increased from the
prior exam. No
enlarged pelvic or inguinal nodes are seen. Again extensive
subcutaneous
edema is appreciated.

No suspicious osseous lesions are detected.

Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the
anatomy and
pathology in this case.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interim development of circumferential wall thickening of the
colon, most
pronounced in the cecum through the hepatic flexure. The
remainder of the
colon is likely thickened to a lesser degree. While
infectious/inflammatory
colitis such as C. Diff remain in the differential, ischemic
colitis is of
concern, given the vascular distribution of the findings (right
sided
predominance and elevated lactate) . The patency of the
mesenteric vessels was
not assessed on this non- contrast exam. No free air, portal
venous gas or
obstruction.
2. Extensive third spacing of fluid including subcutaneous
fluid, pleural
effusions and ascites.
3. Known en
