Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 19017**] is a 66 year-old man with a PMHx of stage 4 COPD
(FEV1 0.65L;FEV1/FVC 37% predicted in [**4-14**]) on 4L home o2 with
numerous hospitalizations for COPD exacerbations and intubation,
hypertension, coronary artery disease, GERD who presents with
SOB and CP. He is admitted to the ICU for management of dyspnea
and hypotension.
.
He was in his USOH until a few days ago when he started feeling
worsening SOB compared to his baseline, in the setting of
running out of his inhalers. At baseline, he has SOB with
minimal activity. This morning, he was again feeling short of
[**Date Range 1440**] while sitting in his bed and used his inhalers. Usually,
they improve his symptoms, but they did not this morning. He
also began experiencing acute on chronic chest pain, with
paroxyms of left sided chest pressure worsened with activity. He
then called EMS. Of note, he has a history of chest pressure in
association with shortness of [**Date Range 1440**].
.
In the ED, his initial VS were 99.3 BP 110/45, HR 95, RR 22
O2sat 94% on room air. He was given Combivent nebs, SoluMedrol
125 mg IV x1, vancomycin, and zosyn. He reported improvement of
his SOB with nebs. He also had a SBP drop to the 80s while
sleeping and responded to 2L of NS bolus. He was then admitted
to the MICU for further management of dyspnea and hypotension.
.
Recent history is notable for the absence of cough, fevers,
chills, and sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] denies nausea, vomiting, or
diuresis in association with his CP, but does note a pleuritic
quality. He does state that he has had decreased oral intake
over the last few days.

IMAGING:
CXR ([**8-23**]) - IMPRESSION: Reticular bilateral lower lobe
opacities are likely secondary to fibrotic changes and
bronchiectasis seen on prior CT. No focal consolidation.
Probable COPD.

CXR ([**8-24**]) - In comparison with study of [**8-23**], there is
continued hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with COPD. No
evidence of acute pneumonia. Fibrotic and even bronchiectatic
changes are seen at both bases, especially on the left.

CXR ([**8-25**]) - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is no relevant change. Bilateral medial subtle areas of
parenchymal opacities, with a predominant peribronchial pattern,
these could represent a status post aspiration or an early
pneumonia. On the left, this area appears minimally denser than
on the previous radiograph. No newly occurred areas of
parenchymal opacity. Signs of overinflation with subsequent
increasing
transparency of the lung parenchyma. Unchanged size of the
cardiac silhouette.

CXR ([**8-26**]) - IMPRESSION: Stable appearances since the previous
study with no new consolidation or pneumothorax.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis - IMPRESSION:
1. Increased bibasilar consolidation and pleural effusions,
concerning for
aspiration.
2. Development of mild ascites.
3. Right shoulder joint effusion.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis.

Echo - Very poor echo windows.
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (?#)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve was poorly seen.
No mitral regurgitation is identified. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2103-8-20**], moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension is now documented (could not be quanitified on
prior study). The other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Dyspnea / Chest Pain - On admission, it was unclear whether
the patient's dyspnea was due to a COPD exacerbation or a
pneumonia.  The patient's tachycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis
were suspicious for a SIRS/sepsis picture.  CT of the chest
showed bibasilar consolidation and pleural effusions, which was
concerning for aspiration. He was started on vancomycin and
zosyn on admission.  He was also started on solumedrol and a
5-day course of azithromycin.  He was also given albuterol and
ipratropium nebs.  Of note, the patient was continued on his
bactrim prophylaxis and his calcium/vitamin D supplementation in
the setting of chronic steroid use.  ACS was ruled out with
three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  His dyspnea improved
throughout his time in the MICU.  Prior to transfer to the
floor, his vancomycin and zosyn were d/c'ed and he was started
on unasyn.  The patient's shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**] continued to
