Discharge Instructions:
Thank you for letting us take part in your care.  You came to
the hospital on [**1-20**] requesting "detox" from alcohol use.
When doctors examined [**Name5 (PTitle) **], they found that you were experiencing
some serious signs of alcohol withdrawl. Alcohol withdrawl is
the severe reaction that your body has when withdrawing from
alcohol and can be life threatening.  Some of the signs that you
were experiencing a serious withdrawl include your shaking, high
blood pressure, sweats, chills, numbness and headache. To treat
your withdrawl symptoms, we started you on a medication called
"diazepam."  Diazepam replaces alcohol in your body and
therefore makes your withdrawl reaction less severe. We
Monitored your condition regularly and saw improvement over
several days.

Because of your alcohol use, you were also found to be suffering
from malnutrition as well as a blood condition called "anemia."
Anemia is a condition in which your blood does not have enough
cells to carry the oxygen that your body needs.  Your anemia had
two causes.  First, excessive alcohol use by itself causes
anemia.  Second, excessive alcohol prevents you from getting all
the vitams and minerals your body needs to make the cells that
your blood needs. These vitamins and minerals include Iron,
Folate, Vitamin B12 and Thiamine. In addition, when your body
does not have enough of these, your nerves can be damaged and
you could experience numbness that may become permanent. It is
extremely important that you have 3 meals a day and get enough
vegetables in your diet. You may also want to consider taking a
multi-vitamin or supplements.

A third condition you were treated for in the hospital is a rash
called "Scabies."  Scabies is a skin condition that is caused my
small organisms. It causes intense itching and can be spread
from one person to another through close skin-to-skin contact.
[**Name (NI) **] were treates with a medication that killed these small
organisms and gradually, your rash started to resolve. Your skin
may continue to itch for some time. Apply Sarna lotion as needed
to reduce your itch.  Keeping the skin clean and dry and
avoiding scratching can help to prevent infection. However, if
signs of a skin infection develop and you feel your rash has
returned or worsened, please consult a doctor or return to the
Emergency Department.

As you are well aware from your life long experience, your
alcohol is threatening your health and your life.  It is very
encoura
