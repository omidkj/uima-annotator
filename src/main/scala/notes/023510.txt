RHC w/ milrinone challenge


History of Present Illness:
69M DMII recent [**Hospital1 1516**] admit for severe R-sided CHF c/b ascites
requiring therapeutic paracentesis admitting to MICU for
hypotension and dyspnea. Fine yesterday but this AM felt unwell,
had diarrhea x 6, chills but no fevers, retching. No appetite
since yesterday. Originally no trouble breathing, CP, back pain,
dysuria. Noticed increasing abdominal girth, weight labile, now
having SOB. Baseline BPs appear to be 110-140s/70-80s.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, 98.2 56 90/45 16 100%/RA. LIJ was
placed for access and eventual CVP monitoring. Cardiology
consulted and recommended [**Hospital Unit Name **] admission but bed was changed to
ICU level given hyponatremia and hypotension. CVL was placed.
Received 1.5L IVF per resident (RN note document 400cc only). No
abx. Most Recent Vitals: 97.9,65 paced rhythm,16,99/42,100% r.a.
0 c/o pain. Labs notable for lactate 1.0, wbc 5.4, Na 117, Creat
4.4, BUN 130, AG 11, Ca 8.2, UA wnl, BNP 2500 and trop 0.06.
Urine lytes showed Na<10. Random cortisol level 20 and TSH 2.5.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt c/o dyspnea on exertion and diarrhea 3
days ago. Wife reports that patient was confused today and
experience diarrhea  (approx 6 episodes since this AM). No sick
contacts. Also nauseated wo vomiting. Pt has been gaining weight
after torsemide dose decreased for hypotension (incr'd 7lb up
from baseline 120lb) and abdominal distension over 3 days with
rapid loss of 4lb today after taking full dose of torsemide. No
dietary changes or med changes since discharge. Has chills
without fever. Wife also measures BP daily and notes hypotension
70/40s for the past 3 days (baseline 120-140s). He denies SOB at
rest, chest pain, cough, or abdominal pain.

Studies:
Abd U/S [**4-23**]:
1. Small cirrhotic liver consistent with cirrhosis. The portal
vein is
patent.
2. Moderate-to-large amount of ascites throughout the abdomen
and pelvis.
3. No evidence for hydronephrosis.

TTE [**4-25**]:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to akinesis of the
interventricular septum and hypoikinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls. The right ventricular free wall thickness is
normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (off milrinone)
(images reviewed) of [**2160-4-16**], left ventricular ejection
fraction is increased, the tricuspid regurgitation is decreased
(was frankly severe on prior study), and ventricular chamber
dimensions are decreased.
