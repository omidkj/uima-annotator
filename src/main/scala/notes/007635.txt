Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Right ventricular infarct

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intra-aortic balloon pump

History of Present Illness:
62 yo M with K-ras WT moderately-differentiated mixed
carcinoid/mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma metastatic to
peritoneum with peritoneal carcinomatosis s/p FOLFOX, FOLFIRI,
iritecan and most recently C3D15 Cetuximab ([**2105-11-26**]), s/p
colonic stent placement [**2105-12-7**] for malignant obstruction, also
s/p LRD-Renal Xplant [**2080**], HCV, x-fer from [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital1 **] for management of large inferior wall STEMI with
BMS to prox RCA, with revascularization resulting in TIMI-1 flow
caused by cardiogenic shock. Pt was hypotensive during procedure
 requiring pressors due to large infarct of his right-dominant
system, on Dopamine, Levo and Neo, with IABP in place and
temporary pacer.
.
Per pt's wife, he had been complaining o intermittent abdominal
pain for several days with recent [**Hospital1 2025**] admissions (discharged
[**11-30**] and [**12-16**]) for management of colonic obstruction, first
with NGT decompression, then with palliative stenting (on
[**12-7**]). He again complained of severe abdominal pain radiating
to his back, nausea and vomiting, so was taken to local ED in
[**Location (un) 47**] for evaluation. Initial EKGs showed ST elevations in
II,III,AVF concerning for inferior STEMI so pt was taken
emergently to catheterization lab where 100% thrombotic proximal
occlusion to large dominant RCA was seen. Pt was in cardiogenic
shock on arrival to cath lab w/ BP ~80s. Cath showed R-dominant
system w/ 100% prox thrombotic occlusion in RCA and 90% culprit
stenosis in proximal to mid vessel treated with single BMS.
Scattered thrombi throughout distal vessels (large PDA and2
large PL branches). Final flow was TIMI 1. As pt was
progressively bradycardic thorughout procedure, temporary pacing
wire was placed via R femoral vein. RV pacing at 80bpm. After
placement of BMS, pt went into runs of NSVT which broke
spontaneously. Pt was given amiodarone bolus and rhythm was
stabilized. IABP placed at 1:1. Pt required intubation in CCU
and 3 pressor support. On arrival to CCU, pt was intubated but
not sedated, unresponsive to commands or painful stimuli, had
bilateral fixed blown pupils, mottled skin, and cold
extremities. ABG on arrival: 7.05/33/65 on PS 5/5 w/ FIO2 100%.
.
On the floor, he is not responsive to verbal or tactile
stimulation.

Past Medical History:
ONC HISTORY:
pt underwent an appendectomy for acute appendicitis in
[**2100-5-21**]. Pathology from the procedure showed a mixed tumor
containing carcinoid and adenocarcinoma invading the appendiceal
wall and penetrating through the visceral peritoneum (pT4) with
perineural and venous invasion. The tumor involved the proximal
resection margin. An MRI of the abdomen on [**2100-6-6**] showed
fatty infiltration of the liver, but no evidence of metastatic
disease. On [**2100-6-9**], he underwent right hemicolectomy and
regional lymphadenectomy. Pathology showed goblet cell carcinoma
in the mesenteric fat and a <2 mm focus of GIST in the cecal
wall near appendiceal stump. Thirteen pericolonic lymph nodes
removed and were negative, rendering him stage II (pT4 pN0 M0).
The resection margins were negative. Mr. [**Known lastname 3012**] was treated with
weekly adjuvant 5-FU and leucovorin from [**0-0-0**],
but treatment was discontinued after five weeks because of
diarrhea and an increase in his creatinine. He was subsequently
followed with serial no[**1-/2103**], after which his insurance refused to pay for additional
studies. In [**1-/2104**], Mr. [**Known lastname 3012**] reports developing abdominal pain
and hematochezia. Later that month, he became increasingly
fatigued and anemic despite using Procrit. A colonoscopy on
[**2104-2-18**] showed a partially circumferential 3-cm mass located
11-13 cm proximal to the anus which appeared to be a metastatic
lesion growing through the bowel rather than a primary lesion. A
CT scan of the abdomen on [**2104-2-24**] revealed peritoneal
carcinomatosis most evident in the omentum, a small amount of
ascites, and rectal wall thickening consistent with the mass
seen on colonoscopy. A chest x-ray on [**2-27**] was negative, and on
[**2104-2-29**], a percutaneous biopsy of an omental lesion revealed
moderately differentiated metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma,
consistent with metastatic colon cancer.
.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Kidney transplant [**2080**] from living related donor, doing well.
Renal failure was due to E. coli infection.
Hepatitis C
Osteoarthritis
Benign brain tumor which caused partial paralysis of the face on
the right side.

Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral
walls and hypokinesis of the inferior septum. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 35 %). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is top normal. There is no pericardial
effusion. There is prominent ascites.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (proximal RCA distribution
leading to RV infarction as well). Mild mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CARDIOGENIC SHOCK- Etiology of cardiogenic shock is large RV
infarct (proximal RCA) of a large R-dominant system, leading to
hypotension that requires use of 3 vasopressors. Pt intubated
but not initially sedated; sedation would prove necessary later
on. Pt initially unresponsive w/ fixed dilated pupils b/l,
repeat exam w/ some purposeful movement, pt able to squeeze
hands b/l and wiggle toes b/l on command.
The patient received atorvastatin, aspirin,and plavix.
Integrillin was run for 18 hours. Serial ABGs were taken;
bicarbonate was given and ventilator settings adjusted based on
acidosis. T
