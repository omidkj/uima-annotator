EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 121 bpm. Tall peaked P waves with
rightward P wave axis. Slight ST segment depressions in leads
II, III, aVF and V5-V6, non-specific but suggest right
ventricular strain and pulmonary process.

CXR [**1-7**]: Vague left mid lung zone parenchymal opacity

CT Chest [**1-8**]:
1. Subsegmental right middle lobe consolidation compatible with
pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion.
2. No definite pulmonary embolism identified.
3. No abscess appreciated.
4. Diffuse anasarca.
5. Small L hip joint effusion and joint space soft tissue
thickening.

CXR [**1-14**]:  Layering right pleural effusion. No evidence of
pneumonia

Bone Scan [**1-14**] 1) Limited three phase bone scan is positive for
osteomyelitis in the sacro-coccygeal region. 2) Abnormal
radiotracer uptake within the left acetabulum and proximal left
femur for which plain radiographic correlation is suggested.

Hip XR [**1-14**]:  Symmetric degenerative changes of the hip joints,
with calcification adjacent to the greater trochanter, possibly
tendinous calcification. Sacrum not well visualized.

CT a/p [**1-16**]:
1. Increased size of ulcer cavity with associated erosion of the
sacrum and coccyx.
2. Area of soft tissue and fluid fullness at the posterior and
right lateral rectum which may be perirectal or intramural in
location. This may be further evaluated with clinical exam. It
appears distinct in location from the sacral ulcer.
3. Stable appearance of left hip effusion and joint space soft
tissue thickening

[**1-11**] Video Swallow:  The pt presents with a moderate
oral-pharyngeal dysphagia. Functionally, he was able to tolerate
ground consistency food and nectar thick liquid sipped from a
straw. There was significant
loss of lingual and pharyngeal muscle tissue appreciated on X-
ray, which is contributing to reduced base of tongue retraction.
The act of swallowing should facilitate build up of this
musculature. The pt consistently produced a cough in response to
penetrated and/or aspirated material. The cough is not
typically effective at clearing material from the airway,
however, it is a good gauge for swallowing therapy in terms of
timing of repeat modified barium swallows to assess for diet
upgrades.

Micro data:
stool cultures negative, including for C. diff
blood cultures negative
urine culture [**2115-1-7**]: PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA 6000 mo/mL


Brief Hospital Course:
64M now chronically debilitated s/p recent SAH from MCA aneurysm
rupture w/ fevers, leukocytosis, bandemia, and hypotension
likely due to urosepsis in the setting of a chronic indwelling
catheter:

ICU course:
Pt was transferred to the ICU from the ED for management of
sespis.  During the ICU stay, the patient defervesced, did not
require pressor support.  He received a total of 11L of IV
fluids.  He remained stable on vancomycin (?MRSA pneumonia) and
ceftazidime (patient has a history of pseudomonas UTI / started
growing out pseudomonas on recent culture).  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test was
performed and was negative.   He was deemed stable to leave the
ICU on [**1-9**].  Note was made of a large sacral decubitus ulcer
with plans to order an air mattress for the patient.

Floor Hospital Course, by problem:
1)Sepsis-likely secondary to Pseudomonas aeruginosa UTI +/-
aspiration PNA. Improving on ceftazidime for UTI and Vanco for
likely MRSA aspiration PNA. Urine culture at rehab grew >100,000
pseudomonas, here w/ 6000 of same. Blood, stool cultures, cdiff
negative were negative.  He remained afebrile throughout his
time on the floor.
2)Hypotension-likely systemic inflammatory response, now w/
stable SBPs.
3)Hypoxia-likely secondary to aspiration PNA now w/improving
with O2 saturations 92-94% on room air.  A follow up CXR on
[**1-14**] did not show consolidation.  A CT the next day showed a
small right pleural effusion.
4)Volume-he was positive 5L out of ICU, which he autodiuresed
successfully.
5) Hyponatremia-This correlated with his free water boluses via
his PEG, and were held prior to his discharge.   His lowest
serum sodium was 128, which corresponded with increasing
lethargy.  His mental status improved by holding his free water
boluses in his tube feeds.  His free water boluses will have to
be managed carefully based upon his serum sodium levels.
6)Osteomyelitis: He had a large stage 4 sacral decubiitus that
on bone scan was consistent with sacrococcygeal osteo. ID was
consulted regarding whether this was chronic or acute osteo and
agreed
