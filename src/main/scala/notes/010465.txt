CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Rule out sepsis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Russian-
speaking gentleman with recent admissions for multilobar
pneumonia, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**6-5**], now
being readmitted for hypotension presumed to be septic. The
patient has had three recent admits to [**Hospital6 12826**] with a question of multilobar pneumonia for which he
has grown out Stenotrophomonas in his sputum which has been
ruled out for AFB on multiple occasions due to a right upper
lobe cavitary lesion. Of note, AFB smears were negative as
well as BAL. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-26**] for further
management and here he was started on a ten day course of
vancomycin/meropenem for a cavitary pneumonia although sputum
cultures were largely negative. His course was complicated by
a COPD flare of which he was treated with a prednisone taper
and a mild episode of CHF after fluid resuscitation and also
C. diff. colitis for which he was treated with Flagyl. Per
reports, he had been doing well at [**Hospital1 **] but had remained
on 4 liters nasal cannula since his recent discharge from [**Hospital1 **].
He has had mild increased coughing and sputum production and
actually had been ambulating with PT and taking good PO's. On
the day of admission, he developed some mild lightheadedness
and was noted to have hypotension with systolic blood
pressures in the 60's to 70's, not responsive to 1500 cc of
IV fluid. He was given vancomycin, gentamicin and Bactrim at
[**Hospital1 **] and then transferred to the Emergency Department. In
the Emergency Department, the patient was afebrile. The blood
pressure was 78/40 with an initial lactate of 4.8 and he was
then treated per sepsis protocol. He received an additional
three liters of IV fluids, received Decadron and also added
clindamycin. An IJ was placed with CVP initially at 215 and a
mixed venous O2 sat monitor was placed and were showing sats
in the mid 70's. He was placed on 100 percent nonrebreather
with saturations at 91 percent on 6 liters and he was stable
and transferred to the ICU.

Currently, he denies any shortness of breath other than notes
some mild productive cough with some green sputum. He also
notes some pleuritic chest pain. He has no abdominal pain,
diarrhea or dysuria.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD, status post CABG three years ago,
unclear of results of anatomy of CABG and also reports having
a cath in [**2181**] with also unknown results.

CHF, the last EF 40 percent on [**5-30**].

Hypertension.

Status post CVA.

Hypothyroidism.

Anemia.

Status post prostate surgery.

qd, Lipitor 10 mg qhs, Advair 500/50 Diskus one puff q12h,
folate qd, Humibid Long Acting 1200 mg po q12h, heparin 500
units subcu q12h, Atrovent nebs, iron sulfate 325 mg [**Hospital1 **],
Bactrim tabs one q12h on the 18th, vancomycin 250 mg q6h,

Synthroid 75 mcg qd, Lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], prednisone 40 mg
qd, Vioxx 12.5 mg qd, Colace, multivitamins, Senokot. Also of
note, he received 300 mg of IV gentamicin and also insulin
sliding scale.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient emigrated from [**Country 532**]
approximately 16 years ago and had previously worked as an
accountant. He has no industrial environmental exposures. He
had a 60 pack year history of tobacco and quit 20 years ago.
He has rare alcohol use. In terms of functional status, he
was quite active prior to recent pneumonias but now living in
[**Hospital **] Rehab.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, he is afebrile at 96.9.
Blood pressure is 101/35. Pulse is 85. Respiratory rate is 20
and 100 percent on nonrebreather. In general, he is very
pleasant and comfortable in no respiratory distress. HEENT is
remarkable for dry mucous membranes. His lungs show diffuse
wheezing and decreased air with bilateral rhonchi. His
cardiovascular examination shows faint heart sounds and is
difficult to appreciate. His abdominal exam is benign.
Extremities show bilateral ankle edema at 1+.

LABORATORY:  Labs on admission show a white count of 27.8
which is up from the last time at 18.7. Hematocrit is 33,
platelet count of 144. His chemistry is sodium 138, potassium
4.7, chloride 103, bicarb 22, BUN 43, creatinine 1.6. His
baseline is 0.8. His glucose is 146. AST is 16 and ALT is 18.
Alkaline phosphatase is 78. Total bilirubin is 0.7. Amylase
and lipase both are within normal limits. His albumin was 2.7
and lactate was 4.8 subsequently improving to 1.6 after fluid
resuscitation. His UA was unremarkable. He had a chest x-ray
on admission showing persistent right upper lobe opacity with
question of a possible pneumonia when compared to prior chest
films. All blood cultures remained negative. Urine culture
remained negative. He had C. diff sent which was positive.
His sputum ultimately grew out Stenotrophomonas, pen-
resistant with only intermediate sensitivity to Levaquin.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Cardiovascular:  The
patient initially came in hypotensive and with increased
lactate level was treated empirically for sepsis. The patient
was aggressively fluid resuscitated in the Emergency Room and
then started on Levophed. By hospital Day No. 1, the
patient's blood pressures were well over 100 and attempts
were made to begin weaning off his Levophed. Meanwhile, his
mixed venous oxygen saturations were well above 70 percent
during the majority of his hospital course. Although the
patient was treated for presumed sepsis, later on it was
slightly unclear as to the etiology of the patient's
hypotension and whether the patient was truly septic as blood
cultures and urine cultures remained negative and sputum grew
back bacteria only later on during his hospital course. Other
sources for hypotension were sought after including cortisol
levels which were normal. He ruled out for an MI by cardiac
enzymes and then later had an echocardiogram initially to
rule out pericardial effusion but which did show a new
depressed ejection fraction of 25-30 percent compared with
previous values of an ejection fraction of approximately 40
percent. Nevertheless, the patient did seem to be fluid
responsive initially and met his goal of weaning off of
pressors. Later during the hospital course, the patient
initially came in in sinus rhythm and on EKG developed rapid
atrial flutter into the 150's. He was refractory to both
diltiazem and beta blockade, but later was started on
amiodarone which resulted in conversion back to sinus rhythm
with heart rates back into the 60's and 70's. Given the fact
that his ejection fraction had decreased with signs of
cardiomyopathy consistent with rate related tachycardia, one
of the concerns was that the patient had become hypotensive
in the setting of rapid rates. The timeline for this
phenomenon is still, however, unclear. However, as the
patient converted back to sinus rhythm, the patient was
subsequently easily weaned off of his pressors. Furthermore,
it was felt that the patient did have a large component of
CHF as the patient had been aggressively fluid resuscitated.
He was later placed on a Lasix drip and diuresed nearly 4-6
liters over the span of the later course of his
hospitalization with subsequently markedly improved blood
pressures. Therefore, although the exact etiology of the
patient's hypotension is unclear, it is now felt that CHF
played a large role in this. Subsequently, the patient has
been optimized in terms of a CHF regimen. First, he is being
started on an ACE inhibitor which is being aggressively
titrated up. This can continue to be titrated up as he
returns to rehab. As mentioned above, he had been loaded on
amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Ultimately, it was decided that the
patient, given his old age and likely risk of possible
bleeding or falls, would not be an ideal candidate for
anticoagulation but would optimize the goal for rate control.
He is being restarted on a beta blockade and will be placed
on an outpatient d
