History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 78861**] is a 54 year old female with a history of
multiple myeloma s/p autologous transplant and dendritic cell
fusion vaccine protocol with progression of disease in the CNS
and C1D20 s/p of Velcade presenting with fever and wet cough.
The patient was in her usual state of health until five days
prior to admission when she noted the onset of a wet cough and
runny nose. The cough was nonproductive. She felt overall
unwell, like she was having a cold. Her symptoms progressed and
she developed signficant fatigue and slept most of the day. She
had a fever to almost 103 two days prior to admission and notes
chills, but not rigors. She has been drinking fluid, but not
eating well. She took Tylenol for the fever. Of note, her son
and her husband also had colds over the last several days, but
their symptoms started after the patient initially started
having symptoms.
.
There was verbal report of an H1N1 exposure, however, after
discussing with the patient, her son works at a daycare
facility. A child developed flu-like symptoms and it was
recommended to this child's mother to have the patient checked
for H1N1. There is no confirmed direct exposure of this patient
to the H1N1 virus.
.
She denies muscle aches, joint pains or rash. She had a single
episode of loose stool with fecal urgency this morning and also
vomited once while in the ED. She believes she had another
single episode of loose stool during this illness.
.
She was seen in the [**Hospital 3242**] clinic for evaluation and initial vitals
were BP 89/58 HR 105 T 99.6. She was given 1 liter NS, had blood
cultures drawn, and she was given 2 grams of cefepime. While in
the clinic, had a temp of 103.4 and 650 mg of Tylenol were
given. Her blood pressures remained 90s/50s in the outpatient
clinic and the patient was transferred to the ED for evaluation.

.
In the ED, vitals were: 101.4 112 93/60 16 89% RA. CXR
demonstrated bilatral consolidations consistent with
pneumonitis. She was given oseltamivir 75 mg once and
levofloxacin 500 mg once. She was given an additional 1 liter
bolus with improvement in her BP to 110s. During her prolonged
ED course, she developed a fever to 102.9 and was given 1 gram
of Tylenol. Her BP was 99/60 at transfer. Her oxygenation
improved to 95% on 5L NC at the time of transfer. She was
briefly on a nonrebreather, but other than the [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 1131**],
no oxygen saturation values under 92% were recorded.
.
At arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]: she reports feeling tired, thirsty but
overall improved. She continues to have an occasional wet cough,
nonproductive. Otherwise ROS as above.
.
Of note, the patient spent [**Hospital1 **] day gardening.


Past Medical History:
She first developed left posterior rib pain in [**2111**] and was
found to have multiple destructive rib lesions. CT-guided biopsy
showed plasmacytoma. She underwent radiation therapy, finishing
in 04/[**2111**]. Work-up at the time revealed a modest IgG kappa and
a question of light chain in the urine. Bone marrow showed a
modest increase in plasma cells without clear evidence of
clonality.
.
In [**2-/2113**] she was found to have SPEP with monoclonal IgG kappa,
light chain in the urine. She had a bone bone marrow biopsy,
which showed 10% plasma cells with abundance of kappa staining
and evidence of plasma cell aggregates and plasmablast. The
patient underwent a
repeat skeletal survey, which showed new punched out lesions in

the skull as well as a calcium of ~10.4-10.9. She was referred
to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], bone marrow biopsy showed plasma cells accounting for
approximately 20% of the cells with kappa restriction. She also
participated in the dendritic cell fusion gene protocol. She
underwent 4 cycles of velcade and decadron.
.
Pt had auto-SCT [**2113-10-16**] on "Vaccination with DC/Tumor cells
fusion in conjunction with Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation
in Patients with Multiple Myeloma" protocol. In [**2114-3-21**] the
patient had acute diplopia and was found to have a CNS
plasmacytoma and underwent radiation therapy. She is currently
C1D20 on Velcade.
.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Irregular menstrual cycles (one per year), found to have an
ovarian cyst.
- Status post breast augmentation in ([**2079**]) by direct silicone
injection
- Gallstones


Social History:
She worked in a library in periodicles but is taking a leave of
absence during treatment. She has been married for 20 years. She
has four children, three of whom live at home. She had smoked
one pack per day and stopped approximately 25 years ago.

of CVA, mother died of speculated emphysema. She has one full
brother and a half-sister.

Imaging:
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2114-5-21**]: Bibasal opacification
consistent with pneumonitis either infectious or from
aspiration.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2114-5-22**]: Asymmetric edema
versus multifocal pneumonia. Consider close interval followup.
.
CT CHEST [**2114-5-24**]:
1. Interval progression of widespread predominantly peripheral
opacities that represent areas of pure ground glass or
combination of central solid
components surrounded by ground glass. The distribution, the
radiological
appearance and the time course are highly suspicious for
infection, in
particular fungal infection given the combination of solid and
ground glass components. The viral or bacterial infection is
still possibility.
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, drug toxicity or bone marrow
transplantation-related reactions are possibility which is less
likely.
2. Bone lesions related to known multiple myeloma.
3. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
54F w multiple myeloma c/b CNS involvement presenting with
flu-like symptoms for 5 days duration including high fever,
cough, rhinorrhea and bibasilar consolidations consistent with
pneumonitis and/or multifocal pneumonia.  Due to her hypoxia and
hypotension, the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient Based on clinical symptoms and
CXR were consitent with a multifocal PNA. Of note, patient also
had exposure through gardening on [**Hospital1 107**]
