Pertinent Results:
TTE [**11-24**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**1-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

If indicated, a TEE would be better to exclude a small valvular
vegetation

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course:

Patient had an ERCP done which showed frank pus in the bile
duct, and a sphincterotomy was performed.  Interventional
Radiology then placed a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, which
drained thin brown fluid.  The patient had been intubated
post-ERCP but was easily weaned to Pressure Support ventilation
and extubated on the night of [**11-22**].

Blood cultures grew out Gram+ cocci in pairs and chains, and his
biliary fluid was also growing Gram+ cocci.  The patient had
been empirically started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.  Speciation
revealed pan-sensitive enterococcus faecium. Due to enterococcal
bacteremia, there was concern for endocarditis and TTE was
obtained. TTE showed LVEF > 55%, mild LVH, 2+ TR and mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, no vegetations seen, but
TEE would be more sensitive and specific.

On [**11-23**], the patient was stable and transferred to the surgical
service on Vancomycin and Zosyn.

His home aspirin can be restarted on [**11-28**] due to concern for
risk of bleeding at the sphincterotomy site.  The patient should
followup with a repeat ERCP in 6 weeks to remove the biliary
stent and the stone. Dr.[**Name (NI) 2798**] office will call patient
with appointment. We will discharge to home and vna services to
infuse ampicillin 2 grms q 6 hours thru [**12-6**]. He will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the clinic in 2 weeks.
