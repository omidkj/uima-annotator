HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old man
with a history of coronary artery disease, asthma and aortic
stenosis who presented with three weeks of cough and loss of
voice.  He was started on Cephalexin 250 mg qid by his
physician at an outside hospital, however, experienced
increased phlegm and pain approximately 1.5 weeks prior to
admission.  He saw his primary care doctor shortly before
admission and chest x-ray showed a multilobar alveolar
pattern consistent with pneumonia.  The patient was started
on Levaquin 5 days prior to admission.  His shortness of
breath continued to worsen so that he had to lie flat.  He
denied any hemoptysis or phlegm and he did not get any relief
from his asthma inhalers.  He was still able to walk
upstairs.  He denied any sick contacts.  Denied recent
travel.  He denied nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia,
productive cough, pets at home.  He had a past history of
angina on exertion years ago but none currently.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma.  Supraclavicular lymphoma.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Atrovent, Serevent, Verapamil 180
mg q day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with his wife, no
tobacco for 28 years, occasional alcohol.  Patient is a
retired professor.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, labs revealed white count of
15.9, hematocrit 37.3, platelet count 281,000 with a
differential of 85% polys, 7% lymphs and 6% monos, 2% eos.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.7, chloride 102, CO2 20, BUN 16,
creatinine .9, glucose 91.  Blood cultures were pending.
Chest x-ray revealed ill defined opacities in the right upper
lobe, the lingula in the bilateral lower lobes.  An EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm with occasional atrial ectopy,
left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage and nonspecific ST
changes.  An echocardiogram showed severe aortic stenosis and
moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery
hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile, blood
pressure 170/90, pulse 82, respirations 20, oxygen saturation
86% on room air, 95% on two liters, heart was irregular with
a 4/6 systolic murmur in all fields.  Lungs revealed diffuse
crackles.  Neck revealed no jugulovenous distension, question
of cervical lymphadenopathy.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
slightly distended with normal bowel sounds.  The patient was
alert and oriented times three in no apparent distress on
room air.  Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the floor with
a presumed pneumonia and treated with antibiotics.

The patient's respiratory distress failed to improve and he
was admitted to the MICU and intubated.  He progressed on the
ventilator and was extubated on [**8-12**] and transferred to the
floor.  On the floor he developed rapid atrial fibrillation
with heart rates to the 150's.  After several hours of this
he became short of breath again and had to be reintubated and
transferred back to the MICU.  Cardiology was consulted and
he was started on Amiodarone.  It was unclear at this point
if the patient still had a pneumonia or was in heart failure
secondary to his rapid heart rate.  [**Month/Year (2) **] Ganz catheter was
passed which revealed a normal wedge pressure although he had
been diuresed prior to the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was believed to rule
out heart failure as a cause of his deterioration.  He also
was found to have a pleural effusion which was tapped and did
not appear to be infected.  He remained in normal sinus
rhythm afterwards and again progressed on the ventilator and
was extubated for a second time on [**8-18**].  Initially post
extubation he did well.  However, on [**8-19**] he developed
increasing tachypnea and wheezing.  He was started
empirically on antibiotics and steroids to treat a presumed
pneumonia and asthma flare.  However, he did not improve and
required increased non invasive ventilation and ultimately
was electively reintubated on [**8-21**].  During that intubation
the patient had a period of asystole as well as bradycardia
which responded to Atropine.  On [**8-22**] the patient developed
shaking of his upper and lower extremities and concern for
seizures led to a subsequent work-up which revealed a
negative head CT and normal electrolytes.  Neurology was
consulted and the patient was felt by then to be in status
epilepticus.  He was started on Dilantin.  In addition, on
[**8-22**] the patient was noted to have the following hematocrit
and platelet counts and elevated INR.  Hematology was
consulted and felt that the picture was consistent with
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and the patient was started on
plasmapheresis.  The patient responded well to plasmapheresis
with increases in his hematocrit and platelet count and
decreases in his LDH levels.  He was continued to be
supported on the ventilator.  He was also continued on
Dilantin and EEG ultimately did not show seizure activity.
For his atrial fibrillation the Amiodarone was discontinued
thinking that it may have contributed to his respiratory
failure.  He was continued on Verapamil.  He was also
supported with tube feedings.  Despite the patient's slow
improvement with the plasmapheresis, the patient's family
ultimately felt that the patient's wishes would not have been
for extended treatment, intubation, and convalescence.
Ultimately the decision was made to withdraw care and the
patient was made comfort measures only on [**8-29**].  The patient
expired of respiratory failure secondary to TTP on [**8-30**].

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  TTP.
2.  Aortic stenosis.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  Respiratory failure.
