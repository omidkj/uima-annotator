HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 56-year-old man
with a complicated and prolonged medical course.  Briefly,
was admitted on [**2133-10-26**] after presenting with shortness of
breath and was subsequently found to have pericardial
effusion.  Had 1800 cc of fluid drained by pericardiocentesis
on [**10-28**].  Pericardial fluid grew aspergillus, with negative
cytology, and patient was started on a regimen of
Voriconazole and Augmentin.  Had echocardiogram which showed
global hypokinesis.  Had episodes of recurrent AFib with
rapid ventricular response.

On [**11-3**], had an episode of asystole with spontaneous
recovery, and was subsequently evaluated by EP with no
interventions suggested.  On [**11-15**], had a syncopal event with
hypotension, low urine output, and anasarca that was
unresponsive to low dose dopa.  A repeat echocardiogram found
reaccumulation of pericardial effusion and evidence of
constrictive pericarditis.

On [**11-17**], underwent pericardectomy and subsequently underwent
a pericardial stripping on [**11-19**].  On [**11-20**], the patient's
antibiotics were changed to
Voriconazole/Vancomycin/Unasyn/caspofungin.  Unasyn was
subsequently changed to Zosyn on [**11-22**] for Enterobacter
cloacae.  Patient's postoperative course complicated by
anasarca with difficult diuresis and worsening renal failure.
Renal consult obtained.  Patient also with respiratory
failure and intubation with difficult wean for which
Pulmonary was consulted and for which patient was transferred
to the MICU team on [**2133-11-30**].

PHYSICAL EXAM ON TRANSFER:  T max 99.0, blood pressure
109-160/58-79, heart rate 64-71, respiratory rate 12-26,
satting 100% on 30% FIO2.  General:  Is alert in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Intubated.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate
and rhythm, normal S1, S2.  Pulmonary:  Left lung clear,
decreased breath sounds on right.  Abdomen was soft, mildly
distended and nontender.  Extremities had 2+ pitting edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 56-year-old man with a history
of lung cancer status post XRT/chemotherapy/right lower
lobectomy, chronically infected nonfunctional right lung and
left lung with decreased compliance resulting in difficult
wean from the ventilator.  Hospital course complicated by
recurrent pericardial effusion and constrictive pericarditis
status post pericardial stripping, aspergillus pericarditis,
and left hemothorax, status post VATS.

1. Respiratory failure:  Patient's prolonged weaning from the
ventilator secondary to combination of nonfunctional right
lung and left lung with decreased compliance also in the
setting of likely respiratory muscle weakness.  Patient is
currently alternating between assist control (250/20/5/0.40)
and trials of pressure support (25/5/0.40).  Goal is for a
pCO2 of approximately 55 to 60, which correlates roughly with
a minute ventilation of approximately 7-8 liters/minute.
Patient has a baseline tachypnea of 30-40
respirations/minute, etiology is unclear, but anxiety appears
to be a component.  Given his baseline tachypnea, the tidal
volume must be adjusted to obtain desired minute ventilation.
Plan is for continued wean of ventilator support as
tolerated.

Additionally, patient had his right pulmonary artery ligated
during his pericardial procedure in an anticipated for a
staged right pneumonectomy, if patient is able to regain
adequate functional and nutritional status prior to
undergoing procedure.

2. Hemothorax:  Patient had hemothorax on left lung on [**12-3**]
of unclear etiology (suspect lysis of clot associated with
removal of chest tube a few days prior).  Patient developed
respiratory distress, followed by cardiac arrest (SBP
approximately 50, heart rate approximately 10).  Patient
received atropine, Epinephrine, CPR with return of heart
rate, blood pressure, and pulse.  Two chest tubes were placed
by the surgical team.  Patient was on Heparin at the time for
history of AFib (PTT 91.7), which was subsequently D/C'd.
His hematocrit dropped from 30 to 15, and he was aggressively
resuscitated with blood products.  Resuscitation efforts were
complicated by difficulty ventilating the patient, ABG
(6.92/150/97) requiring high peak pressures (65-70) and a
therapeutic paracentesis to relieve abdominal distention.

Patient was stabilized and underwent a VATS [**12-7**] for
evacuation of the hematoma.  After the procedure, patient's
ventilatory mechanics improved, and he has had no further
episodes of bleeding or reaccumulation of hematoma.

3. ID:  Patient is currently being treated with caspofungin
and Voriconazole for an aspergillus pericarditis.  Length of
treatment is currently indefinite and will likely remain such
time as patient has right lung removed.  In setting of
continued antifungal therapy, patient needs to have his LFTs
checked approximately every week.  He received a 14 day
course of Zosyn for Enterobacter ventilator associated
pneumonia.  He had an episode of hypothermia, hypotension
[**12-9**].  He was treated empirically with a seven day course of
cefepime for a sputum culture with resistant Enterobacter
(although he had no evidence of pneumonia on chest x-ray or
physical exam).

Adrenal insufficiency was also a likely contributing
component of this episode, and patient responded well to a
seven day course of stress dosed steroids.  Patient has had a
low-grade fever and leukocytosis likely secondary to
sinusitis in the setting of an indwelling nasogastric tube.
His white count has been steadily trending down since removal
of the nasogastric tube.  His last positive culture was a
sputum on [**12-13**] with moderate growth of gram-negative rods
(sputum on [**12-9**] grew Enterobacter and Klebsiella).

4. Cardiovascular:  Patient is status post pericardial
stripping secondary to effusion and constrictive
pericarditis.  Has history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
is on amiodarone and metoprolol.  He has been in normal sinus
rhythm for the majority of his MICU course.  At this time, he
is not on anticoagulation secondary to his hemothorax
episode.  Patient's last echocardiogram [**11-24**] revealed an EF
of 25-30% with severe global hypokinesis and 3+ TR.

5. Renal:  Patient has a history of membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis diagnosed by biopsy 07/[**2132**].  His baseline
creatinine ranges from 1.1-1.5.  He has intermittently had
difficult diuresis and has responded to Bumex 2 mg IV b.i.d.
to t.i.d.  He had two separate episodes of ATN during his
hospital course secondary to hypotension, which both
resolved.

6. Ascites/anasarca:  Patient with volume overload in the
setting of hypoalbuminemia.  Has been slowly resolving as
patient's diuresis.

7. Coagulopathy:  Patient with INR as high as 1.8 during his
stay.  Currently 1.4.  Etiology likely seconda
