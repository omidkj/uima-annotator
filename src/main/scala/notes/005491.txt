Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for Aortic Abscess

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16905**] is an 83 year old man with a PMH significant for
DM2, COPD, PVD, AS, AI needing valve replacement who presented
to OSH with fatigue and dyspnea thought to be related to his
valvulopathy and CHF +/- related to MI or PNA. He was initially
treated with Levofloxacin. Subsequently, Strep Viridans grew
from blood cultures (1 out of 2 bottles)and he underwent a TTE
which showed only AS and AI. He then suffered from respiratory
failure (thought to be related to his AI/CHF) requiring
intubation. A TEE then found a 1.5 x 2 cm abscess in the NCC
region of the Aorta abutting the LA. Culture data from his S.
Viridans then came back sensitive to Cefalosporins and he was
started on Rocephin and given a dose of Aminoglycosides. He was
subsequently transferred to BIMDC for probably surgery to his
Aortic root and valve.

TEE ([**2161-6-3**] in RI): EF 30%. Eccentric AI. 1.5-2cm abscess in
NCC area --> [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 68155**] communication with aorta. Mod TR, Mild
MR.
.
EKG: AFib with rate 100. Nl Axis and intervals. RBBB. PVCs.
.
TTE Conclusions:  The left atrium is normal in size. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is markedly dilated. The ascending aorta
is moderately dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is at least moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. An echodense mass is
seen in the posterior aortic root at the noncoronary sinus of
Valsalva, protruding into the left atrium and measuring 1.8 by
1.7 cm. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is a small to
moderate sized pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Impression: aortic root
abscess/phlegmon
.
TEE GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. No TEE related complications. Resting
tachycardia (HR>100bpm). The rhythm appears to be atrial
fibrillation. Echocardiographic results were reviewed with the
houseofficer caring for the patient. Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. LV systolic
function appears depressed. Right ventricular systolic function
is normal. The sinuses of Valsalva are dilated. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and
descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. The severity of the aortic stenosis was not
determined. There are two moderate-sized regions of
inflammation/vegetation (0.8 cm each) on the left and
non-coronary
cusps of the aortic valve at the area of leaflet coaptation. An
aortic annular abscess is seen (0.8 - 1.2 cm), in the region of
the left and non-coronary cusps. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: The patient is an 83 year old man with CAD s/p CABG,
HTN, DMII, [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from OSH with aortic valve
endocarditis and abscess.
.
# AV Endocarditis/Abscess:  Evidence of this per TEE at OSH in
conjunction with fevers.  Pt grew Strep Viridans 1/2 bottles
sensitive to Cephalosporins.  Has hx of AVD to native valve.  Pt
now hemodynamically stable on low dose of Levophed.  CP free.
TTE/TEE at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed 2 abscesses at aortic root and
preserved EF.  We continu Ceftriaxone 2mg daily (discussed with
ID) and added additional antibiotics (Vancomycin and Flagyl).
CT surgery was made aware of patient and prepared to discuss
options with family but felt that his prognosis was grim. He
expired on HD #1.  Family was en route but was updated
frequently.  At time of death, he required 3 pressors and could
not maintain his BP.  In addition, his heart rate was >160.
.
# AFib:  Unclear of duration, but has been documented to be in
and out of AFib since admission to OSH.
- Rate poorly controlled and we held on nodal agents at first
given risk of heart block in setting of abscess.  PRN BB was
given eventually despite pressors for HR >140s.
- We held Coumadin or Heparin gtt anticoagulation given
intracranial bleed in past but will administer Sub Cutaneous
Heparin 5000 units TID
.
# Respiratory failure:  Secondary to AI/CHF.  On vent throughout
admission until time of death.
.
# DM2:  RISS and QACHS FS
.
# Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine at transfer dose
.
# FEN: NPO (nutrition consult pending); No need for IVFs given
Swan #s;
.
# PPx: Heparin Sub Cu, PPI
.
# CODE: FULL CODE
.
# COMM: With son, pt, wife
.
# DISP: Expired.  Family aware.  RI transfer MD aware.
