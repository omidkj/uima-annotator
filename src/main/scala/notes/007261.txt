Admission Date:  [**2149-4-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2149-4-8**]


Service:  Cardiology Intensive Care Unit

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old female
with significant past cardiac history including coronary
artery disease (status post MI in [**2141**], [**2147**] complicated by
two-vessel disease, total occlusion of the RCA and 70% of the
left circumflex), congestive heart failure with a known
ejection fraction of less than 20%, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, and what was previously believed to be
iatrogenic symptomatic bradycardia secondary to digoxin,
beta-blocker, and amiodarone.

She was discharged on [**3-10**] after a hospital stay for
symptomatic bradycardia.  Patient was discharged on only
amiodarone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.  Her digoxin and beta-blocker
were discontinued.  The patient planned to see
Electrophysiology this week for probable ICD and
biventricular pacemaker placement.  Patient has been stable
and asymptomatic since discharge [**2149-3-7**].

The day of admission the patient felt shaky, presyncopal, and
presented to the Emergency Department.  Patient was found to
have 2:1 type II A-V block with a rate of 35-50.  Patient was
admitted to the CCU for temporary pacer wire.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. CAD status post MI x2.
2. Hypertension.
3. COPD.
4. CHF, EF less than 20%.
5. Atrial fibrillation.
6. Hypothyroidism.
7. Symptomatic bradycardia.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Aspirin 81 p.o. q.d.
2. Plavix 75 p.o. q.d.

44.3, platelets 177.  Chem-7:  Sodium 141, potassium 4.2,
chloride 104, bicarb 25, BUN 12, creatinine 1.2, platelets
108.  CK 26.  MB 2.  Troponin less than 0.01.  Digoxin level
less than 0.2.  INR 1.4.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 81-year-old female with history
of CAD, ejection fraction less than 20%, and paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, who presents with symptomatic Mobitz
type II A-V block.

1. Symptomatic Mobitz type II A-V block:  The patient was off
digoxin and beta-blocker with significant bradycardia.  The
patient was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit,
where the patient had a temporary pacer wire placed.  EP saw
the patient, and the decision was made for the patient to
have a biventricular ICD placed.  The patient was kept on
telemetry until she was able to go to the EP Lab for this
procedure.

On [**2149-4-7**], the patient underwent biventricular ICD
implantation.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
There was no pneumothorax on post-procedure chest x-ray, and
the patient did not develop significant pocket hematoma.  The
patient's left shoulder pain was well controlled with
Tylenol.

The ICD was interrogated on [**4-8**] and appeared to be working
well by EP report.  The patient will follow up one week after
discharge with Electrophysiology for further evaluation of
the pacemaker.  Periprocedure the patient did receive two
doses of vancomycin.  The patient developed an erythematous
blanching rash most prominent over her cheeks, but diffuse
from her head to her knees.  The further doses of vancomycin
were held and the patient received a few days of p.o. Keflex
for periprocedure infection prophylaxis.

2. History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  The patient
has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  She was on
amiodarone and warfarin on admission.  Initially, her
amiodarone was held given her symptomatic bradycardia.  In
addition, warfarin was held in preparation for her ICD
implantation.  Both the amiodarone and warfarin were
reinitiated on [**2149-4-7**] post BiV ICD placement.

3. History of congestive heart failure:  Patient has a known
EF of less than 20%.  After having the temporary pacer wire
placed, the patient did have an episode of pulmonary
edema requiring IV Lasix.  Patient responded well to the
Lasix with resolution of her symptoms.  Prior to being
discharged, the patient was restarted on her home Lasix dose
of 20 mg p.o. q.d.

Of note during this hospitalization, the patient did have
bedside echocardiogram done post having the pacing wire
placed.  The bedside echocardiogram documented severely
depressed left ventricular function, no pericardial effusion,
and inspiratory collapse of her IVC consistent with normal
right atrial pressure.

4. History of CAD:  The patient was continued on aspirin,
Plavix, and Lipitor during the hospital stay.

5. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on her home
Levoxyl dose of 150 mcg throughout hospital stay.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  The patient was ambulating
without difficulty.  She was eating full cardiac diet.  Her
pain was well controlled on Tylenol.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with services.  The patient will
have home safety evaluation by the VNA as well as blood draw
to check her INR three days post discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Congestive heart failure:  Ejection fraction less than 20%
systolic.
2. Mobitz type II atrioventricular block.
3. Bradycardia.
4. History biventricular pacemaker ICD implantation.
5. Atrial fibrillation paroxysmal.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient is to followup with her
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1313**] after discharge.
She has an appointment for [**2149-4-28**].  In addition, she is to
followup with the Electrophysiology Clinic one week after
discharge on [**2149-4-15**].  She is also to followup with her
cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] approximately one month post
discharge.  The patient was advised that her appointment, Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 1313**], she should likely restart her lisinopril, which was
discontinued during this visit secondary to hypotension post
diuresis/ post procedure.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lipitor 80 mg p.o. h.s.
2. Levothyroxine 150 mcg p.o. q.d.
3. Aspirin 325 p.o. q.d.
4. Tylenol 325 mg 1-2 tablets q.4-6h. prn.
5. Trazodone 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. prn.
6. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Coumadin 1.5 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9. Keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. x3 days.
10. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.

OUTPATIENT LABORATORY WORK:  The patient should have her LFTs
checked four weeks post discharge at her follow-up
appointment with her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**].
The patient should have her INR drawn in [**2149-4-11**] for
Coumadin adjustment.  Results should be faxed to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**].
