HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 94633**] is a 77 year old male
who has had multiple medical problems, including severe
valvular ischemic heart failure, class III to IV, coronary
artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal
reflux disease, recurrent pneumoniae and a gastrointestinal
bleed.  The patient was admitted for worsening shortness of
breath times one week.  He initially had shortness of breath
walking in his home, progressing to being short of breath at
rest.  He reports difficulty lying flat.  His Lasix dose was
recently decreased.

The patient was admitted on [**2189-1-9**], initially to
the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] and initially treated for a pneumonia with
Levaquin and Flagyl.  He was switched to cefodizime on
[**2189-1-12**].  He has intravenous Lasix titrated to 80 mg
twice a day.  He has also been on an ACE inhibitor and
nitroglycerin patch on [**2189-1-10**].  During the
hospitalization, he had an episode of chest pain radiating to
the left arm which was relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin
and morphine sulfate.  He ruled out for a myocardial
infarction.  He has been diuresed but has had decreased blood
pressure and increased creatinine with continued rales and
shortness of breath.  His Lasix on [**2189-1-10**] was held
and was restarted on [**2189-1-11**].  His telemetry
suggests recurrent atrial fibrillation.

The patient was transferred to the cardiology medicine team
on [**2189-1-12**] for Natrecor therapy.  The congestive
heart failure service was consulted regarding the patient's
care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
2.  Chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine between
2.2 and 2.5.
3.  Ischemic and valvular heart disease.

7.  Recurrent pneumoniae.
8.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass grafting in [**2184**] with a saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein graft
to obtuse marginal one and left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending artery; cardiac catheterization in
[**2188-2-29**] had native three vessel disease with saphenous
vein grafts occluded, left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending artery patent.
9.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
10. Hypothyroidism.
11. Hypercholesterolemia.
12. History of gastrointestinal bleed secondary to peptic
ulcer disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on transfer to
the c-medicine team, the patient had a blood pressure of
108/50, heart rate 90s, temperature 97 and oxygen saturation
96% on three liters nasal cannula.  General:  Uncomfortable,
lying flat in bed.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Neck
supple, moist mucous membranes, extraocular movements intact,
pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation,
jugular venous distention approximately 11 cm up.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, III/VI holosystolic
murmur.  Lungs:  Crackles bilaterally one-third up.  Abdomen:
Soft, positive bowel sounds, no rebound tenderness, obese.
Extremities:  1+ lower extremity edema to the upper shin.
Neurologic examination:  Alert and oriented times three,
speaks Russian.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count 9.1 with
72% neutrophils, 20% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes and 2%
eosinophils, hematocrit 33.3, platelet count 301,000, sodium
139, potassium 4.2, chloride 100, bicarbonate 24, BUN 50,
creatinine 2.5, glucose 215.  [**2189-1-8**], 11:00 p.m., CK
107; [**2189-1-9**], 2:20 p.m. 29, [**2189-1-10**], 11:00
a.m. 79, [**2189-1-10**] 9:00 p.m. 73, [**2189-1-11**],
7:00 a.m. 93.  [**2189-1-8**] at 11:00 p.m., troponin was
less than 0.3; [**2189-1-9**] one troponin less than 0.3,
[**2189-1-10**] two troponins less than 0.3 and [**2189-1-11**], one troponin less than 0.3

Admission chest x-ray shows resolution of right upper lobe
infiltrate consistent with [**2188-12-11**], right lower
extremity opacity with increased confluence, small bilateral
pleural effusions, left base atelectasis, indistinct
pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild congestive heart
failure; summary, pneumonia with superimposed congestive
heart failure.  Electrocardiogram on admission was paced with
a left bundle branch pattern; compared with old
electrocardiogram, it was completely paced, however, by
transfer to c-medicine, he was in atrial fibrillation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 77 year old male with a
history of diabetes mellitus, recurrent pneumoniae,
significant coronary artery disease, significant congestive
heart failure secondary to ischemic and valvular disease,
atrial fibrillation, and sick sinus syndrome status post
permanent pacemaker, who presents with worsening shortness of
breath and symptoms consistent with worsened congestive heart
failure.  He was treated initially for pneumonia and
transferred to c-medicine for management of congestive heart
failure.

1.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient was loaded on
nesiritide at 2 mcg/kg and later started on 0.1 mcg/kg/minute
drip.  He also initially received intravenous bumetanide 2 mg
twice a day.  Nesiritide was increased to 0.15 mcg/kg/minute
due to lack of initial response.  The patient was placed on
spironolactone 12.5 mg daily, continued on an ACE inhibitor
for afterload reduction for his mitral regurgitation at 20 mg
daily.  The patient was on a two liter fluid restriction, 2
gram sodium diet.  He refused a Foley catheter.

On [**2189-1-15**], the patient was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit for tailored therapy secondary to poor
diuresis on the floor despite Natrecor therapy.  The
patient's weight had actually increased to being 102.6
kilograms on the day of transfer.  He still had jugular
venous distention to the angle of the mandible and still had
crackles on lung exam and complained of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea four to five times on the night of [**2189-1-14**].
However, on [**2189-1-15**], he actually was negative 1.7
liters to the nesiritide and Bumex combination, the first day
that he had been negative during his stay.

On [**2189-1-15**], the patient had a right internal jugular
cordis placed.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was floated without
difficulty.  His numbers were a pulmonary artery pressure of
47/19, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16, mixed venous
62, CTP 9, cardiac output 5.8, SVR 1,000.  He was initially
started on dobutamine 2.5 mcg/kg/minute and continued on
nesiritide drip 0.1 mcg/kg/minute.

On the evening of [**2189-1-16**], the patient complained of
chest pain.  He ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  His
dobutamine and Natrecor drips were stopped.  He had a
nitroglycerin drip started and received morphine sulfate,
which resolved his chest pain.  On [**2189-1-16**], the
patient also had a transesophageal echocardiogram
cardioversion and was shocked into normal sinus rhythm.

On [**2189-1-17**], the patient was transfused two units of
packed red blood cells.  His Bumex was changed to PRN on
[**2189-1-17**] and the Swan-Ganz was discontinued and his
cordis was changed to a triple-lumen over a wire.  He was
transferred to c-medicine on [**2189-1-18**].  When the
patient was discharged from the Unit, his nitroglycerin drip
was changed to oral nitrates a
