History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13142**] is a 41M s/p lap RNY gastric bypass on [**5-15**] who
has been readmitted twice postoperatively for dehydration and
inability to tolerate POs, and most recently discharged
yesterday
([**6-2**]) afternoon.  During this last admission he underwent an
EGD
which revealed a G-J stricture, which was dilated at that time.
Post procedure he tolerated a diet well and was advanced to a
stage 3 diet prior to being discharged on [**6-2**]. At the time of
discharge he was tolerating POs without pain.

Patient reports returning home and trying to stay hydrated with
liquids.  Upon taking POs he again began having nausea and
reports vomiting 4 times, along with several episodes of watery
diarrhea.  Additionally, he reports acute onset of RUQ abdominal
pain which he denies having previously

[**2113-6-3**] CT Abd. :
1. No evidence of acute intra-abdominal pathology.
2. Status post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. No evidence of
leak or
pneumoperitoneum.

[**2113-6-4**] HIDA scan : Normal HIDA scan.

[**2113-6-12**] CT neck :
Bilateral parotitis without evidence for drainable fluid
collections or
stones. A few reactive lymph nodes are seen. There is edema of
the
aryepiglottic folds and false cords, the airway is narrowed but
still
patent.Findings discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].

[**2113-6-19**] EGD :
8 mm diameter stricture was seen at the gastrojejunal
anastomosis as before.
The scope could not traverse the lesion before dilation.
Evidence of a previous gastric bypass with gastro-jejunal
anastomosis was seen.
A 12-15mm CRE balloon was introduced for dilation over a jagwire

The diameter was progressively increased to 15 mm successfully
in the gastrojejunal anastomosis.
There were no immediate complications.
The scope easily traversed the stricture after dilation


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13142**] was admitted to the hospital, made NPO and hydrated
with IV fluids.  His symptoms of right upper quadrant pain
persisted and he was taken to the Operating Room on [**2113-6-5**] for
a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He tolerated the procedure well
and returned to the PACU in stable condition.  His hemodynamics
were stable except for some tachycardia.  His hematocrit was 31
but only increased to 34 after 2 units of PRBC's.  This prompted
reexploration for bleeding on [**2113-6-6**].  A large amount of clot
was evacuated but there was no specific active bleeding
identified.  He was then transferred to the ICU for further
monitoring.
His pain was controlled with a Dilaudid PCA.  He started a stage
1 diet on post op day# 2 and was advanced 24 hours later to
stage 2. He was transferred to the Surgical floor for further
monitoring.
Although he was clinically improving he developed some parotid
gland swelling over 48 hours prompting an ENT consult.  He was
diagnosed with bilateral parotitis and received symptomatic
treatment.  His parotid duct swab cultured MRSA and he was
placed on Vancomycin.  He underwent a CT of the neck as his
swelling did not improve however there were no fluid pockets
that were drainable. He did not exhibit any respiratory
compromise but he had some airway edema noted on CT.
Subsequently he was transferred to the ICU for elective
intubation and IV steroids.
His swelling decreased dramatically within 48 hours and he was
extubated on [**2113-6-16**] and was able to maintain a clear airway.
During his ICU stay his abdominal wound was erythematous and
draining above the umbilicus.  A few staples were removed and he
began [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes.  The wound itself looked clean
without any cellulitis but his drainage persisted.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor for the second time he
began a stage 3 diet and was increased to stage 4 without
nausea, vomiting or fullness.  His neck swelling resolved.  His
only problem was abdominal wound drainage and his dressings were
increased to QID.  A VAC dressing was attempted but he had a
local skin reaction from the adhesive and therefore the VAC was
not used.  His Vancomycin was changed to PO Linazolid per ID
recommendations and that will continue thru [**2113-7-1**].
He was up and ambulating independently and very anxious to get
home to his family.  He was finally discharged to home on
[**2113-6-22**] with VNA services for wound care.  he will follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 week.
