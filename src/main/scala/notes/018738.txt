Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 y/o female with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF
20%), T2DM, HTN, and hypothyroidism who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
ED with 2 days of worsening dyspnea and chest pain. Pt also
reported 2-3 days of intermitttent, diffuse back pain.

Upon arrival to the ED, vitals were BP 164/77, HR 92, RR 34, 71%
O2 sat on RA. She reported 1-2 days of worsening dyspnea and
[**11-12**] SSCP, no radiation or associated symptoms. Sats improved
to 100% on NRB. She was given 1 SL nitro, which decreased her CP
to [**6-12**] but also dropped her BP to 83/42. EKG without any acute
ST changes. There was AV pacing. She was given Lasix 40 mg IV x
1 with marked improvement in her symptoms and able to wean her
oxygen to 4L NC, satting 98%. Foley was placed. CXR reportedly
revealed pulmonary edema but report did not accompany patient.
She was given another 40 mg of IV Lasix. She was also given ASA
325 mg. The decision was made to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for
further diuresis in the setting of hypotension.

Upon arrival to the CCU, she was in NAD and hemodynmically
stable. BP was 106/54 and HR 72, satting 100% on 4L NC, quickly
weaned to 2L NC. She still complained of [**5-13**] chest pain.

Upon further questioning, she explained that there were no
recent changes in her medication regimen. She admits to using
salt on her food but not a large amount. Followed by a
cardiologist at [**Location (un) 745**]-[**Location (un) 3678**]. She had recently had a course
of steroids for gout flare which was perhaps responsible for
fluid retention. Denies F/C. Denies N/V/D/abdominal pain. Denies
urinary symptoms. Denies palpitations or PND. Usually sleeps at
an incline so difficult to know if orthopnea worsened. No recent
travel. ROS otherwise N/C. Of note, pt is a poor historian.


Past Medical History:

ECHO [**12-10**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20%). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is at
least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with elevated LVEDP. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation. At least mild pulmonary hypertension.

CXR [**12-10**]:
1. Right basilar area of consolidation concerning for pneumonia
or
aspiration. Left basilar atelectasis.
2. Moderate cardiomegaly.
3. No sign of failure or effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital1 18**] EKG:
Mostly V-paced, occasional PVCs, no acute ST changes,

70 F with idiopathic cardiomyopathy (EF 20% in [**6-10**]), T2DM, HTN,
and hypothyrodism who presents with worsening DOE and chest
pain.

# DYSPNEA - On transfer, in the setting of pt's history, exam
(basilar crackles, JVD) and laboratory findings (OSH CXR with
volume overload, and elevated BNP), etiology of pt's dyspnea was
thought to be secondary to left sided CHF exacerbacion. Etiology
of exacerbation was thought to be partly dietary indiscretion
and more importantly a recent course of prednisone. Pt was
diuresed aggresively with IV lasix drip. CXR confirmed fluid
overload and ruled out infection. BP meds were held while
diuresing and restarted once tolerated. Pt's oxygen
supplementation was weaned as she was diuresed.

# CHEST PAIN - Not thought to be ischemic based on EKG and
cardiac enzymes.

# Hypotension - Thought to be chronic due to low EF. Pt's
beta-blocker and ace-inhibitor were initially held while
aggresively diuresing and restarted slowly prior to discharge.

# CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE - Pt's creatinine fluctuated around her
baseline with diuresis. She was asked to have her renal function
checked on follow up with PCP.

# DIABETES type 2 - Pt's blood sugars were controlled with
standing glarging and humalog sliding scale.

# HYPOTHYROIDISM - Pt's TSH was elevated and repeated due to
concern for contribution to CHF, but T3 and T4 were within
appropriate range, thus suggesting sick euthyroid. She was
continued on her outpt dose of levothyroxine.

# ARRHYTHMIA - Pt initially had frequent ectopy with PVCs
alternating with paced beats. Her PVCs were not perfusing and
thus her effective pulse was 40s while being paced at 70s. Pt
remained asymptomatic but EP was consulted and recommended
increasing beta-blockade to suppress ectopy. On discharge pt's
perfusing pulse was in the 70s on Toprol.
