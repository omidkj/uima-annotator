Date of Birth:   [**2100-10-1**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 70-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft times three in 05/[**2171**].  Postop
course complicated by transient ischemic attacks.  Patient
had had a right internal carotid artery stenting.  Past
medical history also significant for ischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 25%, [**Year (4 digits) 1192**]
atrial fibrillation, and 1+ mitral regurgitation, history of
hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus who had an exercise
treadmill test MIBI in [**4-/2171**] that revealed an inferior wall
reversible defect and was referred for elective
catheterization.

At baseline the patient reports he can walk a quarter mile,
and he can walk up one flight of stairs without dyspnea on
exertion or shortness of breath.  He denies any history of
palpitations or orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
syncope, or presyncope.  No history of chest pain or chest
pressure.  He denies any extremity edema but reports that he
has gained 12 pounds since [**2171-8-9**].  He also had a recent
episode of shortness of breath that he claimed to have
resolved after he was treated for pneumonia.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for any fevers, chills, nausea,
or vomiting.  Patient has normal bowel movements.  No melena.
No bright red blood per rectum.  No claudication, orthopnea.
Normal urination and no hematuria.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Patient is afebrile with
a blood pressure of 125/62, heart rate of 50, respiratory
rate of 15.  In general he is alert, obese, lying at 20
degrees and pleasant.  HEENT:  He is anicteric with moist
mucous membranes.  No jugular venous distention and
jugulovenous pressure to 4 cm above the clavicle at 20
degrees.  Cardiovascular:  His carotids have normal upstroke
and a diacritic pulse; point of maximal impulse is
nonpalpable; had a bradycardiac heart rate and soft S1 and S2
and a III/VI systolic murmur.  Radial pulses are 2+
bilaterally.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Patient has
no carotid, abdominal, or femoral bruits.  Abdomen is obese,
distended, without tympany, nontender.  Liver is percussed 2
cm below the costal margin.  Extremities are cool.  Patient
has no clubbing or edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Coronary artery bypass graft times three vessels in
[**6-/2170**] with a left internal mammary artery graft to left
anterior descending and supraventricular tachycardia to the
diagonal obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the
right coronary artery to PTA.  [**Year (4 digits) **] AS and MR 1+ right
internal carotid stent, ischemic carotid myopathy with an LV
EF of 25%.
4.  Diabetes type 2.
5.  Right knee arthritis.
6.  History of transient ischemic attack.
7.  History of syncope and fall in [**3-/2171**] status post brain
contusion.
8.  History of polio as a child.
9.  History in [**4-/2171**] at [**Hospital6 2018**] of modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol treadmill test with 60%
predicted heart rate.  Patient stopped early because of
fatigue.  ETT-MIBI with a right bundle branch block and ST
depressions in V5 and V6, inferior wall with a reversible
defect to the inferolateral wall and EF of 30% with global
hypokinesis.

Patient had elective catheterization which revealed high
right and left filling pressures.  RA of 12, a PA of 71/25,
and a PCWP of 23, CO 4.3, CI 1.97.  [**Doctor First Name **] AS with peak
gradient of 20 mm/Hg.  Patient was treated with Lasix and
then Natrecor secondary to an elevated wedge of 35, but the
wedge dropped to 10 after one dose, and systolic blood
pressure went to 65.  The patient was given 300 cc of
intravenous fluid and started on intravenous Dopamine.
Patient then developed chest pain, and the decision was made
to start intra-aortic balloon pump to decrease the chest
pain.  Dopamine was then weaned to 2 mcg per kg per minute
and the chest pain resolved.  ABG at that time was 7.37, 44,
154.  EKG revealed a bradycardiac rhythm of 50 beats per
minute, first-degree A-V prolongation, a normal axis, a right
bundle branch block, and a prolonged QT.

Patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further
management, was weaned off of his Dopamine drip, PADs
decreased appropriately with Lasix diuresis, and patient was
weaned off of the balloon pump.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
2.  Plavix 75 mg q. day.
3.  Lipitor 80 mg q. day.
4.  Toprol 75 mg q. day which had recently been increased
from 50 mg q. day in the past week.
5.  Diovan 80 mg q. day.
6.  Glucotrol 10 mg q. day.
7.  Amiodarone 200 mg q. day.
8.  Lasix 60 mg q. day.
9.  Imdur 30 mg q. day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married with six daughters.
[**Name (NI) **] is a former smoker who quit 20 years ago and drinks only
socially.  Denies any use of any illicit substances.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His brother had an MI at age 39 and also had
a CABG.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 70-year-old man with coronary artery
disease status post CABG status post catheterization.
Catheterization revealed right dominant system, LMCA with 99%
distal filling small [**Name (NI) 1192**] ramus diagonal filling.  LAD,
left circumflex, and RCA were all occluded ostially.  All SVG
grafts were found to be occluded, but the LIMA to the LAD
filled mid LAD with distal diffuse disease apically.
Collaterals from the LAD were visualized and filled
retrograde to the diagonal PL, PDA, and OM branches.

I thought that medical management must be maximized in this
patient, decreased demand ischemia, and minimized oxygen
consumption to keep his heart rate low and his arteries
patent.  He was continued on aspirin, Plavix, and Metoprolol
XL.  His CKs were cycled.  EKGs revealed no changes
throughout admission, and the patient did not develop any
chest pain.  He received an Electrophysiology evaluation for
possible biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
placement secondary to his poor congestive heart failure as
well as to consider a pacemaker to control his heart rate to
maximize beta blockade.

Patient was continued on Lipitor and was set up to encourage
exercise through Cardiac Rehab as an outpatient.  His Imdur
was discontinued as it was seen to be nonbeneficial for him
as he never had chest pain and did not need the symptomatic
relief, and the patient needed to maximize his preload to
maintain profusion pressures.  For rhythm patient had a brady
sinus rhythm throughout admission.  He had a history of
atrial fibrillation likely.  He was on Amiodarone that was
maintained given his poor EF.  He was anticoagulated with
Heparin.
Patient had a history of a long QT on Amiodarone.  This was
monitored.  Patient's TSH was checked to monitor thyroid
function after long-term Amiodarone use.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  For pump issues, the patient had EF of 25 to 30% with 1+
MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] AS with a valve area approximated at 1.2 cm2
and a peak gradient of 20.  He had a history of ischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy and systolic failure given his low EF.
He had a low cardiac index and high pulmonary artery
pressures and pulmonary hypertension.  After weaning him off
the balloon pump his Diovan was maximized.  He was maintained
on a 1500 ml fluid restriction, received daily weights, and a
2 gram sodium diet.  It was thought that the patient needed
to have a pulmonary artery diastolic pressure greater than 25
to adequately overcome his aortic stenosis valve pressures.
He was gently diuresed with Lasix when needed.

2.  Subsequent echocardiogram revealed an EF of 25%, 1+ MR,
and aortic stenosis.   Hypertension:  Was mainly to keep his
blood pressure in the range of 130 to 150.

3.  Diabetes mellitus:  Patient had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult.  They
recommended maintaining him on his Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. q.
day, a diabetic diet.  Hemoglobin A1C was greater than 8, and
the patient was instructed to follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] as an
outpatient.
