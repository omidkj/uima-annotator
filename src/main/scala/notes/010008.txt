Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of temporary hemodialysis line


History of Present Illness:
79 year old male with history of CHF (predominantly diastolic
failure, EF 40-45%, multiple admissions for CHF excacerbations),
ESRD (not on dialysis), pulmonary hypertension, sick sinus
syndrome (s/p dual chamber pacer), paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation (on coumadin), and recently diagnosed poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma with possible mediastinal
metastases who presents with shortness of breath for the last 3
months, worse in the past day.
Reports that he is chronically dyspneic but typically can lay
flat at night. However, in the last several days he has not been
able to lie flat or use his home CPAP due to the dyspnea. He has
not felt his home diuretic have provided any relief. He endorses
orthopnea and PND, but denies worsening peripheral edema and
states that he has lost 40 pounds in the last 1.5 years. Denies
chest pain.
.
He also complains of severe LLE and left "sacroiliac" pain over
the last few days. He had a fall a few weeks ago and injured his
left hip, although his current pain symptoms didn't start until
a few days ago. The pain is in his hip joint and radiates down
the back of his leg. Denies bowel or bladder incontinence.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T97.7, HR69, BP109/56, RR20, O2 sat 96%
4L, [**4-18**] left leg pain. Labs were notable for K 3.2, Creatinine
3.0, BNP 926 with troponin 0.06, stable anemia (Hct 34.4) and
therapeutic INR (2.4). Blood cultures were drawn and sent.
Urinalysis was negative. T spine, hip/pelvis films were negative
for fracture. CXR showed pulmonary edema with bilateral
effusions as well as atelectasis. On exam, the patient had right
basilar crackles and ecchymotic left hip. Vitals on transfer
98.1 70 14 108/50.

IMAGING:
[**2115-5-16**] CXR: There is moderate pulmonary edema, similar to [**4-15**], [**2114**], but with increased, now moderate bilateral pleural
effusions. A left retrocardiac opacity might represent collapse
or postobstructive pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal shilouette
and hila demonstrate known lymphadenopathy. There is no
pneumothorax.
.
[**2115-5-16**] X-ray of T spine: The height of the vertebral bodies of
the T-spine is preserved. There is no compression fracture.
Sternotomy wires, pacemaker leads and surgical clips are seen in
the mediastinum.
.
[**2115-5-16**] X-ray of left hip/pelvis: Vascular calcifications are
seen at the common femoral arteries. There is no fracture of the
pelvis or proximal femurs. There are no significant degenerative
changes at the hip joints.
.
[**2115-5-18**] X-ray left femur: Single AP view of the left femur
shows an intact femur without definite fractures or
dislocations. There is no cortical destruction or focal lytic or
blastic lesions. However, if there is high concern for a marrow
replacing lesion, an MRI or perhaps bone scan would be helpful.
There are extensive vascular calcifications.
.
[**2115-5-19**] CXR: There is cardiomegaly which is stable. There is
left-sided pacemaker which is unchanged. There are disconnected
leads inferiorly which are unchanged. There are pleural
effusions, left greater than right. There is a persistent left
retrocardiac opacity. There is some atelectasis at the right
base. Overall, the findings are relatively stable allowing for
differences in technique and positioning. There is moderate
pulmonary edema.
.
[**2115-5-21**] left leg LENI: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in
the left leg.
.
[**2115-5-21**] CT head w/o con: Head CT very limited by patient
motion, with no gross acute intracranial abnormality.
.
[**2115-5-22**] CT head w/ and w/o con: No hemorrhage, major vascular
territory infarction, edema, mass, or shift of the midline
structures is present. Moderate periventricular and subcortical
white matter hyperdensities are the likely sequela of small
vessel ischemic changes. Prominence of the ventricles and sulci
suggest cortical atrophy. A small lacune or dilated perivascular
spaces is noted in the left posterior limb of the internal
capsule. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved. No
abnormal delayed enhancement is noted. Visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
[**2115-5-22**] CT torso:
1. New left psoas hematoma and slight hematoma of the left upper
thigh.
2. No significant interval change in extensive mediastinal and
hilar lymphadenopathy. Continued peribronchovascular thickening
and pulmonary consolidation in the left upper lobe may reflect
post-obstructive consolidation and/or ly
