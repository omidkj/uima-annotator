Operative Note
-------------------
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right spigelian hernia.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right spigelian hernia.

PROCEDURE:  Right spigelian hernia repair with polypropylene
mesh.

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia and 30 cc of
0.5% Marcaine.

IV FLUIDS:  700 cc.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Minimal.

URINE OUTPUT:  No Foley was placed in the case.

INDICATIONS:  [**Known firstname 1743**] is very pleasant, 79-year-old female
with a history of a right lower quadrant bulge. She had an
outpatient CT by her primary care doctor that showed a
ventral hernia in the spigelian position with terminal ileum
and cecum within the hernia. She had had abdominal cramping
and obstructive symptoms and was sent for a surgical
consultation. Despite her multiple medical issues, she was
offered repair to prevent strangulation. The risks and
benefits of the surgery were discussed, and she signed a
consent.

PREPARATION:  The patient was given intravenous antibiotics
and subcutaneous heparin, taken to the operating room, and
placed in the supine position. Venodyne boots were placed and
activated. The patient was then endotracheally intubated in
the normal fashion. The patient was shaved and sterilely
prepped and draped in the normal fashion.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  Local anesthesia was infused overlying
the palpable mass. An approximately 10-cm incision was made
over the mass with a 10-blade scalpel. Dissection through the
subcutaneous tissue was performed with electrocautery. The
hernia sac was encountered and circumscribed with
electrocautery dissection. The external oblique fascia had
been eroded by this large hernia. Flaps of the external
oblique fascia were created around the hernia defect. The
hernia defect was reduced first by opening the hernia sac and
reducing the bowel within the defect and then by dissecting
the hernia sac in all quadrants. The sac was then closed and
reduced back in the abdominal cavity. The internal oblique
muscle and fascia were reapproximated with a running 0 PDS
suture. A 7.5 x 15-cm mesh was then chosen. It was sutured to
the lateral aspect of the pubic tubercle, the inferior
aspect, and along the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament
inferolaterally. These were done with 2-0 Prolene interrupted
sutures. The mesh was sutured medially to the anterior
abdominal wall and superolaterally to the anterior abdominal
wall. There was good overlap of mesh on the defect. There was
no further palpable defect. The subcutaneous tissues were
irrigated with sterile saline. Bleeding was controlled with
electrocautery. The external oblique fascia was
reapproximated with a running 0 PDS suture. The wound was
irrigated. Additional local was infused. The Scarpa layer and
Camper layer were closed with a running 3-0 Vicryl suture.
The skin was reapproximated with 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular
suture. Steri-Strips and sterile occlusive dressing was
placed over the wound. The patient was extubated in the
operating room and transferred to the post anesthesia care
unit.

COUNTS:  Correct x2 prior to closure.

COMPLICATIONS:  None were apparent.

IMPLANTS:  A 15 x 7.5-cm polypropylene mesh.

STUDY: CTA chest with and without contrast and recons.

INDICATION: A 76-year-old female with hypoxic episode. Evaluate
for PE.

COMPARISON: [**2171-1-31**].

FINDINGS: The major airways are patent down to the subsegmental
level. There is a new, small left pleural effusion and trace
right effusion. Diffuse emphysematous change is again noted in
the lungs, especially in the upper lung fields. Also noted are
interstitial changes and fibrosis in a predominantly peripheral
and basilar distribution, most consistent with usual
interstitial pneumonitis (UIP). These changes are not
significantly changed since previous study, [**2170-1-10**]. No
suspicious nodules or masses are identified within the lung
parenchyma. Vascular calcifications are again noted within the
coronary arteries. The main pulmonary artery measures 2.7cm and
right main 2.3cm and left main 2.9cm. Large hiatal hernia is
again noted and unchanged.

CT Pulmonary Angiogram: Respiratory motion limited evaluation of
the distal branches in both lower lobes. No pulmonary embolism
is identified. No secondray signs of PE are present.

Please note that given principal concern for pulmonary embolism,
bolus timing was optimized for pulmonary arterial enhancement,
not for aortic enhancement. Patient again noted to be post
aortic dissection repair with stent graft in stable position
extending from the proximal ascending aorta through the
descending aorta terminating just proximal to the aortic hiatus.
No gross evidence of leak or graft failure noted. The region of
short segment dissection of the right common carotid artery is
again noted and stable when compared to previous studies (3:11)
although not optimally evaluated on this study.

Limited views of the abdomen demonstrate no obvious
abnormalities within the liver or spleen.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Limited evaluation as
above.
2. Stable appearance to thoracic aortic stent graft. No evidence
of aortic dissection although bolus timing is not optimal for
evaluation for dissection as per given clinical history. No
periaortic thrombus identified.
3. Stable emphysema and fibrotic changes.
4. Stable large hiatal hernia.
5. Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
