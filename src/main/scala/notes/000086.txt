Imaging:
[**2182-9-18**] CXR - FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**9-12**],
there is again acute enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
Although the retrocardiac area is poorly seen, there does appear
to be some increased opacification that would be consistent with
atelectatic change.  Mild prominence of the right hilar vessels,
though no definite increase in pulmonary venous pressure is
appreciated.
.
[**2182-9-9**] TTE: EF 30%.  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
septal, anterior and distal LV akinesis. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
89yo F w/ CAD s/p MI, Afib, DM2, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] here w/
wide complex tachycardia and elevated CEs.

* Wide complex tachycardia:  On admission, pt was thought to
have supraventricular tachycardia with right bundle branch
block.  She was given adenosine; however, the adenosine did not
break rhythm.  The rhythm lasted for a few hours and broke
spontaneously.  The pt was hemodynamically stable during the
event.  She noted only a mild discomfort in her interscapular
area.  Approximately 24hr after the rhythm broke she went into
it again, w/o hemodynamic compromise or symptoms.  Again, the
rhythm broke spontaneously after a few hours--metoprolol was
given during the event without apparent effect.
EP was consulted (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was initially EP attending, then Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  They determined that the rhythm was actually a
narrow, monomorphic ventricular tachycadia with RBBB and an
inferior axis, likely arising in/near the septum.  (Of note, the
official EKG readings in OMR do not describe the rhythm as
VT--see EKG from [**2182-9-7**] at 4:23 for an example of the VT.)
Pt had a third episode of VT, during which she was given
lidocaine with good response.  Discussion was had between the
team, the pt, and the pt's family about whether the pt should
undergo an EP study or start amiodarone empirically without an
EP study.  Given the patient's overall clinic picture and
wishes, amiodarone was started, no EP study was done.  She was
loaded with approximately 6grams of amiodarone.  She was then
continued on 200mg daily for maintenance.  The patient had no
further episodes of ventricular tachycardia after starting the
amiodarone.
Of note the patient had normal thyroid & liver function prior to
starting amiodarone.  She is scheduled to follow-up with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at his [**Hospital1 **] office on [**2182-10-15**] at 2:40pm.  She
will likely need baseline pulmonary function tests,
ophthomalogic exam, and repeat thyroid & liver function tests.

* PEA arrest: After the patient's third episode of VT broke, she
had a severe coughing fit, and became hypoxic with 02 into the
70s.  She then went into PEA arrest, presumably from hypoxia, as
no other cause was found.  CPR was performed for less than 5
minutes before a spontaneous rhythm was achieved.  However, the
patient was intubated given concern over her ability to proctect
her airway.  The patient was intubated for less than 48hr.

* Coronary artery disease:  Pt has a remote history of an MI
approximately 15yr, at which time she underwent angioplasty.
Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she had diffuse ST elevations on EKG
at OSH.  These had resolved by time of admission here.  Pt was
without chest pain.  CE were elevated on admission & trended
down.  Her EKGs from OSH were reviewed and it was questioned
whether the ST elevations were from ischemia vs. repolarization
change or pericarditis.  Given her lack of CP and overall
clinical picture, it was felt that she did not need to go for
cardiac catheterization.  She was continued on her statin.  Her
b-blocker (coreg) was given until she was started on amiodarone,
at which time it was stopped due to bradycardia occasionally
into the 40s (without symptoms).  She is being discharged off of
coreg.  Caution should be used with b-blockers given she has
first degree AV block and is on amiodarone.  The pt refuses
aspirin due to prior bleeding with it.

* Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled with amiodarone.  Coreg
discontinued due to bradycardia (hr 40-50s on amio).  Coumadin
dose decreased to 1.5mg daily (from 2.5mg) after starting
amiodarone.  INR on day of discharge was 2.  This should be
rechecked on [**2182-9-20**] and coumadin adjusted as necessary.

* Congestive heart failure: acute on chronic systolic heart
failure.  Echo during this stay showed an EF of 30% with
moderate mitral regurgitation moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation.  She was diuresed with IV lasix as necessary and
continued on home dose of lasix 20mg daily.  On day of
discharge, pt received a dose of 20mg IV lasix for slight volume
overload.  Her aldactone (25mg daily) was also restarted on
[**2182-9-18**].  An ACEi or [**Last Name (un) **] was not started during this hospital
stay due to relatively lo
