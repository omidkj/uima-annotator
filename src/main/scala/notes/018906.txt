Placement (x2) in Right Coronary Artery.


History of Present Illness:
54 year old male with PMH of hypercholesterolemia admitted with
chief complaint of chest pain.  Pt reports that this afternoon
he had substernal chest pain and diaphoresis.  Previously he was
in good health and denies any h/o angina.
.
In the ED EKG revealed STE in inferior leads and in V5/V6.  Pt
was loaded with 600mg of plavix, given 325 ASA and given heparin
bolus.
.
Cath revealed 70% mid-RCA lesion and occlusion of PDA.
Thrombectomy of RCA and PCI placed in RCA and PDA lesions.  Was
given fentanyl for CP.
.
On transfer to CCU pt was in sinus rhythm, SBP 160 and vitals
were otherwise unremarkable.  Venous sheath was still in place.
Pt still complaining of chest pain and STE have not yet
resolved, but improved.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

IMAGING
[**2106-10-23**] Cardiac Cath:

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
normal.
The LAD was patent. The LCx had less than 50% stenosis. The RCA
had a
70% mid-vessel lesion and a subtotal occlusion before the
bifurcation
with complete occlusion of the PDA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systolic and diastolic
arterial
hypertension.
3. Successful aspiration thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
distal
RCA into the PDA with a 3.0 x 18 mm Promus DES (see PTCA
comments).
4. Successful direct stenting of the mid RCA with a 3.5 x 28 mm
Promus
DES (see PTCA comments).
5. Successful RFA AngioSeal (see PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Successful aspiration thrombectomy and PCI fo the distal RCA
into the
PDA with a 3.0 x 18 mm Promus DES.
4. Successful PCI of the mid RCA with a 3.5 x 28 mm Promus DES.

[**2106-10-24**] TTE:

The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal 2/3rds of the
inferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 40-45 %). Transmitral and tissue
Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with focal basal free wall
hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
biventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (prox/mid RCA
distribution). Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 yo male with PMH of hyperlipidemia who
presented with chest pain and found to have STEMI s/p 2
drug-eluting stent placement.
.
# Acute Inferior Myocardial Infarction (STEMI): Initial EKG
showed ST elevation in II, III, aVF, V5 and V6, as well as ST
depression in I, aVL, aVR, V1 and V2. Pt underwent emergent
catheterization, which revealed 70% stenosis of RCA, and 100%
occlusion of PDA. Aspiration thrombectomy was performed, and 2
Drug-Eluting Stents were placed (distal-RCA into PDA, mid-RCA).
Post-PCI echocardiogram performed on HD 2 was notable for mild
LV dysfunction, w/ EF of 40-45%, and severe hypokinesis of basal
[**3-4**] inferior/inferolateral walls and mild pulmonary
hypertension. His post-cath course was complicated by right
groin hematoma at the site of access on HD 2, but resolved
without intervention. He also developed low-grade temps to Tmax
of 100.5, but was without other concerning signs or symptoms for
infection or acute thromboembolic event. He was started Aspirin,
Plavix, Atorvastatin, Lisinopril, and Metoprolol. He tolerated
these medications well, and at time of discharge, pt had
experienced no observed arrhythmias on telemetry, and was
asymptomatic, feeling well and ready to go home.
