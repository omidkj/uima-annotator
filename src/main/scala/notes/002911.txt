declined. He presents with an INR of 1.5 after 2 units of fresh
frozen plasma.  The patient understands the risks of surgery and
the risks of giving aprotinin.  He consents and
wishes to proceed.


Past Medical History:
1. Congestive heart failure with 4+ mitral regurgitation and
tricuspid regurgitation. This has been longstanding, and the
patient has thus far refused surgery for valve replacement.
2. Atrial fibrillation. (past refusal of anticoagulation)
3. Gout.
4. Nephrolithiasis.
5. Prostatitis

[**2187-3-14**] CXR
There is stable marked cardiomegaly with particular enlargement
of the left atrium. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature shows upper zone
redistribution, but there is no overt pulmonary edema. The lungs
are clear. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

[**2187-3-24**] CXR
Since the prior study of [**2187-3-22**], left chest tube has been
removed. A tiny left apical pneumothorax is seen. The left
lateral costophrenic sulcus is cut off from view. Some fluid and
atelectasis are seen in this location. Less fluid visualized
compared to prior study. The right lung remains clear.

[**2187-3-16**] EKG
Ectopic atrial rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Low QRS
voltage in the precordial leads. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2187-3-16**] non-captured pacemaker spikes are absent.
Clinical correlation is suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 52477**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2187-3-14**] for surgical
management of his mitral valve disease. Fresh frozen plasma was
given as his INR was slightly elevated due to his hepatic
dysfunction. A foley catheter was placed with some difficulty
preoperatively and thus a size 18 french was used. The On
[**2187-3-15**], Mr. [**Known lastname 52477**] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent a mitral valve replacement utilizing a 31mm mosaic
porcine heart valve. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative
day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 52477**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was
extubated. He was transfused for postoperative anemia. Aspirin
was started. Mr. [**Known lastname 52477**] developed atrial fibrillation which was
treated with diltiazem and amiodarone. He was gently diuresed
towards his preoperative weight. On postoperative day five, Mr.
[**Known lastname 52477**] was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit
for further recovery. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. He
was slow to ambulate as he had foot and joint pain. As he had
extensive peripheral edema, his ethacrynic acid was resumed. His
left pleural tube remained in place as he continued to have
drainage. It was ultimately removed on [**2187-3-24**] without
complication. He needed close monitoring and repletion of his
electrolytes his diuresis on ethacrynic acid. His INR remained
stable in the range of 1.5 off vitamin K. Mr. [**Known lastname 52477**] continued
to make slow but steady progress and was discharged to the Life
Care Center rehabilitation on postoperative day eleven. His
amiodarone will be titrated appropriately. He will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and his primary
care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient. His electrolytes and
INR will be monitored daily while at rehabilitation.
