Admission Date:  [**2101-12-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2102-2-2**]

Date of Birth:   [**2041-6-11**]       Sex:  F

Service: Bone Marrow Transplant

This discharge summary will cover the dates of [**2102-1-27**]
to [**2102-2-2**], during which time I assumed care of the
patient.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary failure - The patient was
     extubated in the Intensive Care Unit on [**2102-1-25**].
She tolerated extubation very well with normal oxygenation on
room air.  She was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit
to the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit on [**1-27**].  The patient
did not have any further pulmonary issues throughout her
hospital stay.  Of note, a sputum culture from [**1-20**]
was positive for Enterobacter Cloacae which was thought to be
due to ventilator-associated pneumonia.  Therefore the
patient was started on Vancomycin which was continued for a
seven day course and then discontinued.

2.  Acute myelogenous leukemia - On discharge the patient
will be day 51 after induction chemotherapy with Idarubicin
and Cytarabine, for acute myelogenous leukemia.  The patient
did not undergo consolidation due to her acute respiratory
illness and persistent fevers.  The patient did have a bone
marrow biopsy on [**1-25**], and the preliminary results
revealed no leukemic cells.  The patient will follow up with
her primary oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to discuss further
consolidation treatment after she has recovered physically
from her long Intensive Care Unit stay.

3.  Infectious disease - As mentioned earlier, the patient's
cultures drawn during her period of febrile neutropenia were
all negative, however, sputum cultures from [**1-20**] grew
Enterobacter Cloacae and the patient was treated with a
course of seven days of Gentamicin.  In addition, blood
cultures from [**1-25**] grew 4 out of 4 bottles of coagulase
negative Staphylococcus aureus.  Therefore the patient was
started on Vancomycin.  At that time her subclavian catheter
and arterial catheters were both removed.  The catheters did
not grow out any bacteria.  A subsequent blood culture from
[**1-28**] did not grow any bacteria.  The patient was
maintained on Vancomycin for a 13 day course and then it was
discontinued.  The patient did not have any recurrent fevers
while she was on the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit.

4.  Nutrition - The patient had been on total parenteral
nutrition during her stay on the Bone Marrow Transplant Floor
in [**Month (only) 404**] entering her Intensive Care Unit stay, however,
she was transitioned to tube feeds at the end of her unit
stay.  On arrival to the floor, the patient was tolerating a
full diet and did not need total parenteral nutrition or tube
feeds, however, she was supplemented with Boost.

5.  Abscess - The patient had a mid line was placed on [**1-25**] which was converted to a PICC line on [**1-30**] in order to
facilitate blood draws and intravenous fluids.

6.  The patient did have transiently elevated liver function
tests, however, these improved when her Atovaquone was
stopped.

7.  Endocrine - The patient had been started on
Hydrocortisone in the Intensive Care Unit for adrenal
insufficiency.  This was being weaned when the patient was
transferred to the floor.  We continued to wean her
Hydrocortisone and by the time of discharge she was off of
Hydrocortisone.  However, it should be noted that if the
patient develops sepsis bacteremia or any severe infection
she should be started on stress dose steroids as she had
recently been on steroids.

The patient had no further issues during her stay and will be
transferred to a rehabilitation facility for strengthening
and nutrition needs.
