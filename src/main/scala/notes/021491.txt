History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male who presented to ED with fever
and chills that began at 4PM on the day of admission.  He had
been in rehab since his discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-4**].  His BP at
the nursing home was 75/50.  He has had a decreased PO intake
for the last weeks or so.  He admitted to SOB while in the ED,
denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  Upon
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED his BP was 118/63 and temp was 102.4, and he
was started on the sepsis protocol.  He was given 5L NS which
increased his BP to 134/64.  He was started on levoquin, flagyl,
and ceftriaxone.  He was agitated while in the ED and received 4
mg haldol with some relief.
Upon arrival in the ICU he stated he was feeling slightly
better.  He denies SOB, chest pain, abdominal pain.  He does not
recall having fevers, but does admit to chills.  He is very
thirsty.  His only pain is in his feet.  He reports that prior
to admission he was not feeling well, had a poor appetite and
decreased PO intake.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) SEPSIS: [**Age over 90 **] year old male admitted with fever and confusion
due to sepsis secondary to recent UTI, likely urosepsis. Pt was
treated with levofloxacin for a 10 day course. Urine cultures
came back positive for pansensitive Proteus mirabilis, blood
cultures showed gram-negative rod. C. Diff. toxin negative. A
double coverage was not considered necessary as the pt was
improving. The pt was initially presented with a respiratory
alkalosis and a metabolic acidosis. He was rehydrated
aggressively with LR and additional sodium bicarbonate.
Electrolytes were repleated accordingly. Once the metabolic
acidosis resolved only LR was used. The pt's CVP and urine
output were monitored. The uriine output increased moderately
over time but never exceeded 60ml/h. The Creat remained stable
st the pt's baseline of 1.2. He was thought to have a certain
degree of chronic renal failure. As the pt became more
tachypneic on [**8-15**] and had intersitial and alveolar infiltrates
on X-ray, while his the BP was normal and the urine output did
not increase, rehydration was decreased.
.
2) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Most likely a mixed pre-renal and
pre-ATN picture. FENA <1% [**2141-8-18**], with spun urine with granular
casts and white and red cells. Patient had a mixed gap and
non-gap acidosis, as well as a respiratory alkalosis, most
likely secondary to temporary ARF. Renal function improved
gradually, with Cr increasing up to 1.7 and then decreased down
to a baseline of 1.2. Patient is leaving with a foley catheter
in place. He has had good response to Lasix.
.
3) CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Patient had a moderate degree of
heart failure, likely secondary to fluids given in the ICU.
Echo revealed and EF>55% and patient has responded well with
Lasix.
.
4) ANEMIA: Most likely anemia of chronic disease, particularly
given Fe/TIBC of [**1-9**]. Once pt has stabilized s/p sepsis, it
would be worthwhile to re-run iron studies.
Drop in Hct was likely hemodilutional given large amount of IV
NS that was used for resuscitation. However the stool guaiac was
positive and an outpatient f/u should be done, especially in the
context of a previous hx of colon ca. Iron studies showed an
anemia of chronic disease. No transfusions were done.
.
5) ELEVATED ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE:
--Old GGT level highly elevated at 181 from [**6-11**], thus making a
bone etiology less likely. Elevated alk phos most likely
secondary to a EtOH use and hepatic disorder. Patient could be
evaluated as an outpatient with RUQ U/S and possibly even liver
biopsy. While AST was recently elevated at 44, ALT NL, as were
total protein.
.
7) THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Initially platelets dropped from 219 to 111
but then stabilized around 130. As the pt is on heparin some
component of HIT Type II was suspected. HIT Type I seemed to be
unlikely as the PTLs never dropped below 100 although heparin
was continued. Given that Plt > 100, the patient has no
increased risk of bleeding. This might have been a part of the
patient's septic reaction. Recommend monitoring as an
outpatient.
.
8) Elevated INR: INR up to 1.7 on Hospital Day #2. VitK was
given and INR normalized.
.
9) MS CHANGE and DIFFICULTY WITH SPEECH: Per patient's nephew
(who does not live with the patient), the patient was
functioning well, mobile in the neighborhood and very social
prior to these two
