Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2972**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11327**] is an 83 M with a history of systolic CHF, s/p MVR on
coumadin, chronic kidney disease, and dementia who experienced
the sudden onset of abdominal pain this morning around 9:00 AM
while at his podiatrist's office.  He was referred to the ED
where he was noted to have pain out of proportion to exam. He
underwent CT scan which did not reveal acute cause of his pain.
While in the ED, he had a bowel movement with a small amount of
bright red blood, then another with more blood, then a third
with more blood. He simultaneously became tachycardic to the
120s though maintained his blood pressure. After administration
of a dose of IV morphine, his pain resolved.
.
Upon arrival to the ED vitals were: T 96.8, HR 88, BP 116/64, RR
16,  100% on RA. He received 4 mg IV morphine for pain and 500
cc IVF, after which he dropped O2 sat to upper 80s which
improved with deep breaths to mid-90s. GI team was consulted
from ED and stated they would consult on patient tomorrow, no
urgent intervention unless decompensates. His PCP/cardiologist
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] from the [**Name (NI) **] and recommended giving FFP
in the setting of bleed despite his mechanical valve. While in
the ED, he received 4 mg IV mophine, 500 cc IVF, IV Zofran, 1
unit FFP (started). He was ordered for a unit of pRBCs but did
not receive it. Vitals prior to transfer to the MICU were:
Afebrile, HR 124, BP 122/80, O2 sat 94% on RA.
.
MEDICINE HPI:
In brief, this is a 83M with dementia, chronic systolic CHF with
an EF of 30-35%, Afib and MVR on warfarin, and dementia who
presented with BRBPR. He was taken to the ED where he received a
bolus of NS 500 mL x1 and became more hypoxic. Given his
abdominal pain and bleeding, a CT scan was done of his abdomen
and GI and General Surgery were consulted. The CT showed no
acute abdominal process and severe cardiomegaly with mixing
artifact in the spleen. Given his comorbidities, borderline BP,
and risk of bleeding he was admitted to the MICU for further
management. In the MICU overnight his H/H were stable and he was
ultimately called out to Medicine for further management. Of
note, review of notes and history shows that the patient had
been having severe abdominal pain, but he does not relate that
history.
.
On the floor he is oriented to person only. He denies any pain
or SOB but is on oxygen. He reports that he is thirsty. He
cannot fully explain why he is here, but reports "all kinds of
problems" as leading to his admission.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2133-3-18**] at 4:26:22 PM  The interatrial
septum is aneurysmal. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
[**10-15**] %). Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal
free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**12-28**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A mechanical
mitral valve prosthesis is present. The transmitral gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-12-15**],
left ventricular systolic function has declined. The severity o
