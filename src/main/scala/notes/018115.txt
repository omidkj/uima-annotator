Echo [**2173-1-24**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification with a
moderate inflow gradient (in part due to significant
regurgitation). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

chest X ray: [**2173-1-21**]
Chest: A single semi-upright AP view at 9:30 p.m. is compared to
previous examination earlier from the same day. Since the
previous exam the interstitial edema has decreased. There is an
endotracheal tube with the tip approximately 4.5 cm proximal to
the carina. There is a new single lead pacemaker with the lead
overlying the right ventricle. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. There are probable pleural calcifications in left
lower lung. There is focal opacity in right upper lobe which may
represent pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 84 year old female with HTN, hyperlipidemia, recently
diagnosed pneumonia treated with antibiotics, found by nursing
home to have HR 30's, found to be in complete heart block.
.
1. CV: Rhythm: Patient was taken to the cath lab, intubated for
agitation, and a external screw-in pacemaker was placed. Unclear
source of complete heart block, given she r/o for ischemia, more
likely worsening conduction system with age.
A permanent DDD pacemaker  was placed on [**2173-1-25**] with no
complications. Patient should have a follow up appointment with
device clinic in 1 week.
Pump: Patient on admission appeared volume overloaded, and her
lasix dose was increased from 40 po day to 40 IV q day. Patient
responded well, and later on was transitioned back to her home
dose40 PO/day
ECho on Echo on [**1-24**].EF >55%Mod AS, MOd MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and severe
pulmonary artery systolic HTN on ECHO.
Ischemia: Patient rule out for MI, enzymes negative.
BP: patient was initially hypotensive on admission, and was
started on Dopamine. After procedure, she was transfer to CCU
and Dopamine was weaned off over the following 12 hours.
CAD: Patient was continued on Aspirin, Statin, and Ace was
re-started once patient was transfer to the floor.

2. Pulm: patient was extubated succesfully in the morning of
[**2173-1-24**]. Patient did well after extubation.
.
3. ID: Pneumonia, was treated at NH with Erythromycin. Chest X
ray on admission compatible with Right upper lobe pneumonia.
Patient was switched to Azytromycin- Ceftriaxone. Sputum final
showed sparse oropharingeal flora. Per ID recomendation, and
given good clinical conditions, antibiotics were stopped on
[**2173-1-25**].
Per electrophisiology recs, she received Vancomycin for 48 hours
after procedure, since patient will be d/c after 24h, she will
receive 1 more day of keflex.
.
4. Hypothyroidism: Patient with high tsh and low free t4 on
admission. levothyroxine dose was increased from 75 to
100mcg/day.
.
5. Dementia: Continue Namenda.
.
6. FEN: Cardiac heart diet monitor electrolytes and replete prn.
