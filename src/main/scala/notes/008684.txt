Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2107-11-16**]


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 62 year-old W with PMH of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, tricuspid
regurgitation/ mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and
alcohol abuse, transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with dyspnea on
exertion.
.
At [**Location (un) 620**], patient was diuresed with IV Lasix and Aldactone.
She was diagnosed with acute renal failure, her electrolytes
were abnormal, the aldactone and lasix discontinued, and she was
given Kayexalate and Magnesium. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
.
During admission, patient developed hematemesis. NG tube was
placed. Red blood was lavaged. GI was consulted and patient was
transferred to CCU for urgent scope. In the CCU, urgent scope
revealed large ulceration in the duodenal bulb with adherent
clot. GI injected epinephrine and cauterized visible vessel.
.
Pt's VS were stable throughout procedure and stat HCT on arrival
to CCU was unchanged.

.
[**2107-11-18**] H. Pylori Ab: negative
.
[**2107-11-15**] ECG: atrial fibrillation, rate 73, nl axis, nl
intervals, right-bundle morphology with no significant change
compared with prior dated
.
[**2107-11-16**] Cardiac Catheterization: 1. Coronary arteries are
normal.
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures with near
equalization consistent with possible constriction. Though due
to
underlying atrial fibrillation restriction cannot be excluded.
Additionally, possibility for pseudoconstriction due to volume
overload.
3. Mild pulmonary hypertension
.
[**2107-11-16**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. Intrinsic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-8-30**],
the right ventricular is more dilated, the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation is slightly increased, and the estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is higher. The severity of mitral
regurgitation appears reduced.
.
[**2107-11-18**] CXR: No active disease in the chest. Mild cardiomegaly.
.
[**2107-11-18**] EGD: Medium hiatal hernia
Blood in the stomach
Ulcer in the first part of the duodenum (injection, thermal
therapy)
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old woman with PMH of atrial fibrillation, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, moderate 3+ TR, severe
right sided failure admitted for diuresis and course complicated
by upper GI bleed from duodenal ulcer.

# GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED/Anemia.
The patient was admitted for congestive heart failure but course
was complicated by GI bleed for which she was transferred from
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].  She had an NG tube placed and lavage showed bright
red blood.  She underwent an EGD on [**2107-11-18**] which showed a
duodenal bleed which was injected and cauterized.  The patient
was followed by serial HCTs.  She continued to have melanotic
stools.  She was transferred out of the CCU on [**2107-11-19**] and then
transferred back in on the same day for dropping HCT and
melanotic stools.  On [**2107-11-20**] she stopped having blood in her
bowel movements.  Her HCT dropped to 25.8.  She refused to have
blood transfusions.  She was given Pantoprazole gtt.  H. Pylori
Ab was negative.  Her blood pressures stayed in the 100s
systolic with HR in the 100s in atrial fibrillation. A
colonoscopy in [**2105-6-20**] showed decrease in vascularity of the
whole colon but was otherwise wnl to the
cecum. She was otherwise asymptomatic without lightheadedness or
chest pain.  Her hematocrits remained stable between 22 and 26
for the remainder of her hospital stay.  At the time of
discharge, her HCT was 23.4.  She denied chest pain or angina.
She was discharged on Prilosec 20mg PO BID, Fe PO and GI
outpatient follow up.
.
# RIGHT SIDED HEART FAILURE.
This was deemed likely secondary to severe TR.  She was
initially started on lasix gtt for mild hypervolemia in setting
of low BPs, but this was discontinued due to GIB on [**11-19**]. Echo
showed elevated RAP, LVEF >55% w/ nl thickness, RV moderately
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis, severe TR and
moderate PAH.  Pt. recveived IVF for GIB.  She was euvolemic on
exam for the remainder of hospital stay.  She had no dyspnea.
Her Metoprolol was held [**1-22**] GIB (see above) and was restarted on
[**11-22**] and was continued through the remainder of hospitalization
without episodes of hypotension.  She was started on lasix 20mg
PO BID on day prior to discharge.
.
#. CAD: Patient had no evidence of CAD on cath which showed
elevated left and right sided filling pressures w/
pseudoconstriction due to volume overload and mild PAH.
Her ASA was held due to GIB.  ASA status will be restarted as OP
based on further GI evaluation.
.
#. Atrial Fibrillation  Patient was rate controlled. CHADS score
= 2 considering diastolic disfunction and hypertension, however
patient is not currently anticoagulated, given concern for her
alcohol abuse.  ASA was held [**1-22**] GIB.
Her BBk was restarted prior to discharge, please see above.
.
#. History of Alcohol abuse.  Patient did not have evidence of
withdrawal. CIWA scores were 0.  She received Folic acid,
thiamine and MVI during hospitalization and discharged home with
this regimen.
.
#. UC.  This was inactive during hospitalization.  She was
continued on Mesalamine per home regimen.
.
#. PPx.  Patient was
