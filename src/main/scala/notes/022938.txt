Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT WAS ADMITTED AND BROUGHT TO THE OPERATING ROOM FOR
EVACUATION OF SUBDURAL COLLECTION.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Subacute left subdural hematoma.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Subacute left subdural hematoma.

FIRST ASSISTANT: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 103967**]

PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Left craniotomy for evacuation of
subdural hematoma and placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain.

INDICATIONS: The patient is a 73-year-old male status post
fall about 3 weeks ago. He presented to the emergency room
the day before complaining of right-sided weakness,
difficulty finding words, headaches, and micrographia. A CT
showed a subacute subdural hematoma, and it was decided to
take him to the operating room.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and
taken to the OR. There, he was intubated and the appropriate
antibiotics were given IV. Following that, the left head area
was shaved and then prepped and draped in the usual surgical
fashion. Then, a slightly curved incision was performed on
the left frontal area using a #10 blade. Prior to that,
lidocaine with epinephrine was used for infiltrating the skin
incision. Then, using the periosteal, we removed the skin
away and [**Doctor Last Name 10747**] clips were used for hemostasis as well as
bipolar.

Then, we used the TPS drill to perform a bur hole close to
the midline. After that, a small craniotomy was performed
using the craniotome. The dura was opened in a cruciate
fashion and what looked like subacute-to-chronic subdural
hematoma started to come out. Careful and copious lactated
Ringer's irrigation was used until clear CSF was coming from
the area of the subdural hematoma and the brain was noted
there. Following that, we placed a flat [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain within
the cavity of the subdural hematoma and the bone flap was
placed in position. The drain was tunneled through a separate
skin incision. The wound was irrigated with bacitracin
solution, and it was approximated using 0 Vicryl for the
galea and staples for the skin. The patient tolerated the
procedure well. A sterile dressing was applied on the wound.
A separate suture was used to keep the drain in place.

I was present and performed the major part of the operation.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.
