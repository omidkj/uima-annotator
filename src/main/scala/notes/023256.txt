Allergies:
Morphine Sulfate / Lipitor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10842**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
  Patient is an 84M h/o CAD, s/p CAGB, h/o VT s/p ICD, ablation,
CHF (EF=20%), with recent hospitalization for decompensated HF
from [**2030-5-16**] after presenting with similar complaints of
shortness of breath and fatigue.  His BNP was elevated at >
6000.  His chest xray did not show significant pulmonary edema
or evidence of infiltrates.  He had a negative CTA to exclude
pulmonary embolism.  He had a TTE which showed increasing mitral
and tricuspid regurtitation with increased dilation of the left
ventricle. He had three sets of negative cardiac enzymes. He was
continued on his home dose of lasix 40 mg two times a day,
carvedilol, and lisinopril.  He was also started on
spironolactone.  The patient reports feeling significantly
improved prior to discharge, without shortness of breath with
exerction and resolution of lower extremity of edema.  During
that hospitalization the patient also had an EGD showing
multiple gastric errions with a recent dx of HPylori.  Patient
was discharged on flagyl, doxycycline, bismuth and omeprazole.
.
  Since discharge, the patient has felt increased fatigue and
worsened dysnpnea on exertion.  He also complains of a dialy
cough, producing a clear mucous, but no fever or chills.
Endorses symptoms of LE and scrotal edema, abdominal distension,
and lack of appetite.  Has experienced PND, but no change in his
2 pillow orthopnea.  While patient was walking [**1-23**] miles daily 3
miles earlier, now unable to walk one city block.  He denies
chest pain, palpitations, or lightheadedness. He has had no
change in his medications since discharge, and has taken them
reguarly.
.
   Patient was seen in Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 108210**] office on day of admission,
and was reffered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation.  In the [**Name (NI) **], pt had
a temperature of 97.2, HR 86, BP 93/60 and was 100% on RA.  He
was given 40mg IV lasix and admitted for further manegement.

Percutaneous coronary intervention: Multiple cardiac caths
- [**2105-9-23**]: Patent SVG->PDA; RCA, SVG-OM and SVG-LAD were known
 occluded. No intervention
- [**2105-8-23**]: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Distolic
dysfunction. 3. Cypher stent was placed in the ostium of RCA
SVG graft which was 95% occluded. c/b ventricular fibrillation
in which his ICD administered shocks did not convert him & he
required external defibrillation.
- [**2101-10-23**]: Successful rotational atherectomy and PTCA of the
upper and lower pole OM1.
- [**2101-8-23**]: three stents were placed in the mid OM1, the
proximal
OM1, and the upper pole of OM1 with good residual flow. The
saphenous vein graft to the PDA was diffusely diseased with 90%

touchdown stenosis and PTCA & stent of this vessel was performed
with good residual flow afterwards.

Pacemaker/ICD, placed in [**2099**] after having monophasic V-tach.
Recent device check [**5-/2108**] with no sustained arrhythmias.

SINGLE AP UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The right
costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. There is
severe cardiomegaly, unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is
within normal limits without evidence of volume overload. There
is no pleural effusion. There are no focal pulmonary opacities.
There is no pneumothorax.

Unchanged single-lead left-sided cardiac pacer with ventricular
lead in unchanged position. Median sternotomy wires and
mediastinal surgical clips are also unchanged since prior study.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Percutaneous coronary intervention: Multiple cardiac caths
- [**2105-9-23**]: Patent SVG->PDA; RCA, SVG-OM and SVG-LAD were known

 occluded. No intervention
- [**2105-8-23**]: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Distolic

dysfunction. 3. Cypher stent was placed in the ostium of RCA
SVG graft which was 95% occluded. c/b ventricular fibrillation
in which his ICD administered shocks did not convert him & he
required external defibrillation.
- [**2101-10-23**]: Successful rotational atherectomy and PTCA of the
upper and lower pole OM1.
- [**2101-8-23**]: three stents were placed in the mid OM1, the
proximal
OM1, and the upper pole of OM1 with good residual flow. The
saphenous vein graft to the PDA was diffusely diseased with 90%


touchdown stenosis and PTCA & stent of this vessel was performed

with good residual flow afterwards.

Pacemaker/ICD, placed in [**2099**] after having monophasic V-tach.
Recent device check [**5-/2108**] with no sustained arrhythmias.

CT Abd - [**2109-5-17**] - IMPRESSION: Marked injected intravenous
contrast reflux into the IVC and hepatic veins indicating
right-sided cardiac insufficiency. Abdominopelvic ascites could
be related to third- spacing from cardiac dysfunction. No other
abdominopelvic acute pathology is identified.

CTA Chest - [**2109-5-18**] - 1. Negative examination for pulmonary
embolism.
2. Cardiomegaly, pulmonary arterial hypertension and probable
right heart failure.
3. No pericardial or pleural effusion.
4. Limited examination, however, an element of air trapping in
the lung bases which might indicate an airway abnormality.

LLE Leni - [**2109-5-17**] - No evidence of DVT in the left lower
extremity.

ECHO - [**2109-5-18**] - The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed

(LVEF= 20 %). The estimated cardiac index is depressed (0.93
L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. The mitral valve leaflets do not
fully coapt. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive

filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Th
