Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubated on [**2185-2-17**] & extubated [**2185-2-18**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] is a 65 yo M with a h/o uncontrolled DMII, ESRD on PD,
CAD, CHF w/ an EF of 25% and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who
presents with altered mental status x 1 day. Patient was
discharged Tuesday night following admission for SBP and foot
infection; family states that he was slightly confused at time
of discharge.  Wife states that he was disoriented and unable to
eat or drink during the day on Wednesday.  Per family, he was
unable to perform PD as usual.  Wife states that he was
requiring constant supervision and that she was afraid he would
fall.  She called daughter who states that he was somnolent,
unable to complete a sentence, and unable to stand. Wife denies
any fevers or rigors at home.  Daughter reports that he has been
increasingly somnolent with incoherent thoughts since last week.


.

In ED, HR 74, BP 101/65, RR 21, SpO2 100% on NRB.  A CXR and CT
head were performed.  Blood, urine, and peritoneal fluid were
sent for culture, and he received a dose of vancomycin and
zosyn.  Given his somnolence, patient was intubated in ED for
airway protection.   He received normal saline 2 L, ASA 325 mg
PR, Vancomycin 1 g, and Zosyn 4.5 g.  Following intubation,
blood pressure dropped to 78/50 and levophed gtt was initiated.

[**2185-2-16**] 10:35 pm BLOOD CULTURE      VENIPUNCTURE #2.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):
      GRAM POSITIVE COCCUS(COCCI).    IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.

   Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2185-2-18**]):
      GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.

ECHO [**2185-2-17**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-30 %).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2184-7-5**], the left ventricle is
more dilated. The mitral regurgitation is reduced.

CXR [**2185-2-19**]: A single portable image of the chest was obtained
and compared to the prior examination dated [**2185-2-18**]
demonstrating no significant interval change.  An enlarged
cardiac silhouette associated with pulmonary vascular congestion
is again seen.  There is a left retrocardiac opacity likely
secondary to underlying atelectasis, difficult to exclude
pneumonia.  No new focal opacities are seen.  The right central
venous line is grossly unchangedand terminates within the
expected region of the cavoatrial junction.  The endotracheal
tube and nasogastric tube had been removed in the interim.




Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo M with a h/o uncontrolled DMII, ESRD on PD, CAD, CHF w/ an
EF of 20-30% and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who presents
after recent discharge with altered mental status x 1 day and
continuing chronic bilateral lower extremity ischemia.
.
#) Altered mental status: etiology unclear, but hyperviscosity
secondary to Waldentrom's is unlikely given serum viscosity of
1.3 (nl 1.4-1.8). After careful review, it appears patient has
been experiencing increasing lower extremity pain and has self
increased pain medication dosing. After metabolic etiologies
were excluded, it appears both altered mental status and
hypercarbic respiratory arrest were medicaiton induced. Patient
was re-evaluated by podiatry regarding foot ulcers, as these
seem to be the source of his severe pain. For details, please
see under Foot ulcers below.
.
#) Hypotension: on adm, pt met 1 of SIRS criteria (afebrile, HR
74, WBC 7.9, RR 21) but required levophed for BP support
following intubation. Only definitive culture data is ?????? bottles
+ for GPCs.  Essentially unchanged E
