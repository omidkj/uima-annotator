HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old woman with
a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (two
intubations, baseline 4 liters of oxygen, steroids),
hypertension, who presents with increasing shortness of
breath on the morning of admission.  No chest pain, no fever
or chills.  Positive nonproductive cough for two to three
days.  No nausea or vomiting, no abdominal pain, no relief
with her inhalers.

With EMS, the patient was speaking in two to three-word
sentences, oxygen saturations 90% on 4 liters, respiratory
rate 28 to 30, received two nebulizers en route.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was diaphoretic,
with increased work of breathing.  Temperature 99.3, blood
pressure 170/65, heart rate 106, respiratory rate 15, oxygen
saturation 90% on 4 liters.  Arterial blood gas:
7.19/119/85/47.  Given Solu-Medrol 125 mg intravenously.
Placed on CPAP with settings of [**2084-5-19**]%.  Peripheral oxygen
saturations 96%.  Repeat arterial blood gas:  7.30/83/56/43.
Changed to 5 liters nasal cannula.  Chest x-ray shows
questionable right lower lobe infiltrate superimposed upon
long-term right lower lobe opacity with question of scarring.
One dose of ceftriaxone and Levaquin given.

Upon examination, the patient states breathing better, but
still with shortness of breath.  Denies any chest pain.  No
abdominal pain.

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **], [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].D.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  80 pack year history, quit one and a half
years ago.  Denies currently using tobacco.  Lives with her
daughter.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.3, heart
rate 113, blood pressure 144/57, respiratory rate 16, oxygen
saturation 88 to 92% on 5 liters.  In general, this is an
elderly female, lying in bed, with increased work of
breathing, pronounced pursed-lip exhalations, speaking
five-plus word sentences.  Head and neck examination:  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements
intact, mucous membranes dry with crack in the middle of her
lower lip.  Chest:  Barrel chest with distant breath sounds,
prolonged expiration with wheezes.  Cardiovascular:  Distant
heart sounds, regular rate and rhythm, no jugular venous
distention.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender, with positive
bowel sounds.  Colostomy bag intact, with soft formed stool.
Extremities:  No edema, distal pulses 1+ bilaterally.
Neurologically alert and oriented.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 20.4 (baseline
20.5), hematocrit 38.4, platelets 352, MCV 102, differential
86 neutrophils, 2 bands.  INR 1.0.  Sodium 147, potassium
4.0, chloride 99, bicarbonate 38, BUN 19, creatinine 0.7,
glucose 192.  CK 63, troponin less than 0.3.  Digoxin level
1.7.  Electrocardiogram shows MAT at 110, normal axis, normal
intervals, no segmental Q waves, normal R wave progression,
no significant ST changes, with nonspecific ST depression in
V5 to V6.  Chest x-ray was a suboptimal study with stable
appearance of right lower lobe opacification, likely
secondary to focal scarring, may have slight increase in
opacity consistent with atelectasis or scarring or fluid
within fissure.  Lungs otherwise clear.  No pleural effusion,
no pneumothorax, unremarkable pulmonary vasculature.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit service, and her hospital course is as
follows:
1.  Pulmonary:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation, questionable precipitant.  The patient was
started on empiric antibiotic coverage while waiting for
sputum culture analysis with Levaquin 500 mg once daily.  She
was also continued on stress dose steroids and nebulizers.
She was maintained on noninvasive ventilation through her
hospital course in the  Medical Intensive Care Unit with mask
ventilation transitioning to BiPAP.  Her PCO2 was noted to
increase to over 100 and then stabilize in the 90s on her
ventilation, without any evidence of somnolence secondary to
hypercarbia.  She was able to maintain peripheral oxygen
saturations and PCO2 in the 90s, with periods of rest off of
her BiPAP on Venturi mask and nasal cannula combined, and
also just nasal cannula on its own.  Given the patient's
baseline high CO2, it is thought that she will likely benefit
from chronic BiPAP.

The patient remained tenuous during her Medical Intensive
Care Unit course, and had an acute decompensation which was
requiring increasing oxygen requirement in order to maintain
her peripheral oxygen saturation greater than 88%.  She
developed thick copious sputum with a temperature spike.  It
was thought that, at this time, she would likely need
intubation.  The issue of intubation and difficulty weaning
once this was to be instituted was discussed with the patient
and her daughter, possible long-term chronic ventilation
support would be required.  Both the patient and her daughter
were in agreement if intubation was required.  The patient,
however, was able to be stabilized with noninvasive
ventilation.  She continued to improve, requiring mostly
nasal cannula only, with periods of rest on the Venturi mask
and nasal cannula ventilation.

2.  Infectious Disease:  The patient completed a ten day
course of Levaquin.  There was no identified organism in her
sputum secondary to nonproductive cough.  When the patient
developed a temperature spike and increased secretion
production, repeat sputum culture was obtained, which was
pending at the time of this dictation.  She was given a dose
of vancomycin and three days of ceftazidime during this
increase in her sputum production for coverage of nosocomial
infection, however, given her rapid clinical improvement, it
was thought that this was unlikely, and the ceftazidime was
discontinued.  The patient also developed change in her
stools to green liquid diarrhea with an increase in her white
blood cell count from the baseline of 20 through her hospital
course to 30, with evidence of increased bands.  She was then
started empirically on Flagyl for likely C. difficile with
cultures pending.

3.  Cardiovascular:  The patient continued to have MAT.  Her
theophylline level was checked as the possible precipitant,
which revealed low levels.  She was discontinued off of her
Digoxin, and started on Diltiazem, which was titrated up to
60 mg four times a day for her heart rate control.  Her blood
pressure was elevated, and the patient was continued on
Zestril, started at 10 and increased to 30 mg once daily at
the time of this dictation, which obtained better blood
pressure control without any evidence of increase in her
creatinine.  She received one time dosage of lasix secondary
to desaturation and crackles on examination, presumed fluid
overload with pulmonary congestion.  At
