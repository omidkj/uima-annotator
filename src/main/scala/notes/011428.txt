Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11220**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness and recent fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
88yo F w/ h/o HTN, lower extremity edema and afib on coumadin
was brought in by family for concern of lethargy and found to be
hyponatremic to 106. Pt had an unwitnessed fall on Friday ([**8-5**])
but denies head strike or LOC. She briefly c/o posterior right
shoulder which resolved shortly afterwards. Family noticed that
pt had increasing fatigue and mild intermittent confusion over
the past week. Her son said that on Wednesday they were able to
complete a 2 block walk, longer than her usual walks, and did
not experience SOB but felt fatigued afterwards. Pt has not had
fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, dysuria, abdominal
pain or bowel changes. However, family noted decreased appetite,
po intake and urine output during this time. Pt lives alone and
according to her son is normally quite functional and
independently prepares her own food, reliably takes her
medications and walks stably with a cane. Pt had complained of
increased lower extremity edema during this time and in an
effort to decrease edema pt reportedly decreased her fluid
intake. When son stayed with his mother over the weekend and
noticed decreased uop, the family recommended that she drink
free water. Per family report she continued to take her
prescibed doses of her medications, including anti-htn meds
HCTZ, diovan and felodipine. Pt has had chronic lower extremity
edema worsening over the past month and was evaluated by PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**7-8**] and [**7-19**]. On both visits pt was found to have 3+ pitting
edema in lower extremities with clear lungs and non-elevated
JVP, not clinically determined to by volume overloaded. On [**7-8**]
pt was found to be hyponatremic to 128 (baseline Na 134-138 over
past year). PCP recommended compression stockings which she has
not been compliant with, and discontinuation of felodipine
however pt was hesitant to do so since she felt the CCB was
improving her bp. Also of note, on [**7-8**], pt's weight was 131.5lbs
(59 kilos) and had elevated INR of 4.7 (previously within [**1-8**]
INR goal, on [**2-22**] INR 2.4).

Last echo (stress) [**5-12**]: normal LVEF >55%, no wall motion
abnormalities, no evidence of inducible ischemia, poor
functional exercise capacity. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation at rest. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.9 HR: 60 BP: 143/68 Resp: 22
SaO2Sat: 100. Labs notable for Na 106, K 2.9, Cl 73, Ca 7.9,
Phos 1.3, Mg 1.8.
CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema and
possible right lower lobe atelectasis. Pt was started on empiric
antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Pt was
started on NS at 100cc/hr.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 97.8, hr 64, bp
147/78, rr 19, Sa02 93% on RA. Repeat labs after pt received
~150cc NS showed Na 106, K 3.1. Pt was continued on NS at
100cc/hr and electrolyes repleted with Mg sulfate, K phos and Ca
gluconate. After ~500cc NS repeat Na was still 106. After ~666cc
NS repeat Na was 107 and Ca 8.2, Phos 2.8, Mg 2.5. Renal was
consulted regarding starting hypertonic 3%NS.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI. Pt reported poor sleep over thursday and friday
nights for unclear reason and increased Tenderness near iv site
on right forarm that began in ED. Pt has chronic constipation
and has home bowel regimen.

gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing.

frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies
rashes or skin changes.

On the day of discharge ([**2168-8-16**]), the patient's labs were:
Na 137, K 4.1, Cl 101, HCO3 26, BUN 19, Cr 0.6
INR pending

Brief Hospital Course:
88yo F w/ week of increasing fatigue, confusion and poor po
intake found to be hyponatremic to 106 with altered mental
status.
.
Severe symptomatic hyponatremia of unclear etiology, resolving
- admitted to the ICU for hypertonic saline and furosemide
- Nephrology consulted
- ultimately thought to have been multifactorial, possibly
diuretic related vs. SIADH
- volume status difficult to assess given the issues noted below
- fluid restriction 800mL/day
- stable Na for several days prior to discharge
- felodipine and HCTZ were stopped and should not be restarted
.
Pulmonary edema and lower extremity edema on admission
- found on CXR, and BNP was elevated
- attributed to her history of diastolic CHF (followed by Dr.
[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 171**])
- repeat TTE this admission showed: EF>55%, right atrial
lengthening and moderate TR, MR, pulmonary hypertension. EKG in
ED did not show e
