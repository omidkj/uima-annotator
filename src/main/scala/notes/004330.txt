Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2178-8-24**] for an elective radical
cystoprostatectomy and creation of a neobladder by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The procedure went well and the patient was dischared to the
trauma intensive care unit in stable condition with a Foley, a
suprapubic tube, and two JP drains.  His hematocrit was stable
after 1700 cc blood loss and 2 u prbc given intraoperatively.
His sp tube and foley catheter had excellent urine output; his
bun/cr were normal.  He was extubated on POD 1 and transferred
from the ICU to the floor on POD 2.  He passed flatus on POD 4
and his NGT was removed.  He was started on a house diet, which
he tolerated.  His pain was initially controlled with a PCA, but
was then controlled with percocet after his ngt was removed.  He
did not tolerate percocet so was switched to vicodin which
worked well.  He also was given iv toradol.  He was followed by
the pulmonary medicine service in house.  Serial chest films
demonstrated a small right lower lobe consolidation although he
was afebrile and oxygenating well on room air.  He was started
empirically on a 10 day course of levofloxacin for nosocomial
pneumonia.  He required 2-4 l o2 nasal cannula until pod 3 when
he was weaned to room air with Sao2around 92-93%.  He was
ambulatory prior to discharge.
