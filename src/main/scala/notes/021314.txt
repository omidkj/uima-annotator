CXR [**2125-10-20**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-18**], there has been
placement of a right internal jugular catheter that extends to
the level of the carina in the mid portion of the SVC. Left
jugular catheter has been pulled back so that the tip is near
the junction with the subclavian vein.
The retrocardiac region appears somewhat clearer than on the
previous study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 81M w/ ESRD on HD, Diastolic CHF, afib, previous
line infections currently being treated with vancomycin,
presenting with GNR bacteremia.

Hospital course:
The patient was admitted to the medical ICU with fever and
hypotension. He was empirically treated with linezolid for MRSA
and VRE, and zosyn for broad gram negative coverage.  He
underwent hemodialysis the day after admission and the line was
removed by interventional radiology at that time. Blood cultures
eventually grew out e.coli, sensitive to gentamicin, zosyn, and
bactrim, and resistent to ampicillin and all cephalosporins.  He
was continued on zosyn but then switched to gent for dosing
during HD.  A temporary line was placed on [**2125-10-19**] for HD use
and then converted to a tunnelled line on [**2125-10-22**].  The new line
was successfully used for hemodialysis on [**2125-10-23**].

He initally had low BPs and required low doses of levophed, but
this was weaned off on hospital day four. He was initially
covered with linezolid as well while blood cultures were pending
given h/o VRE, but this was changed back to vancomycin to
complete his course for MRSA bacteremia from prior admission.
His last dose of vancomycin was administered on [**2125-10-23**].  He
will continue gentamicin, dosed at hemodialysis, until [**2125-10-31**].

The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation but has
previously declined warfarin anticoagulation.  He was continued
on aspirin during his hospital stay.  The patient's anemia was
also evaluated as an inpatient and he made be a candidate for
epogen in the future.  His iron studies were consistent with an
anemia of chronic disease.  Because he has COPD, the patient was
continued on his tiotroprium inhalers.

The patient also has obstructive sleep apnea and was continued
on CPAP qHS at home settings: CPAP 10 with 4 liters 02 at 150 mL
of dead space. He periodically refused to wear his CPAP mask and
subsequently desatted to the 70s during these episodes.
