Brief Hospital Course:
# STROKE:
The patient was admitted to the Neuro ICU for observation after
TPA at OSH. The patient has remained hemodynamically stable
throughout her stay and her neurological exam continues to
improve. Re-imaging at 24 hours post-TPA demonstrated no sign of
bleed.

The cause of the patient's stroke was unclear.  There was
suspected clot in the left ICA, however dissection could not be
ruled out.  MRA with T1 fat suppression was not suggestive of
disection and it was felt that the occulsion of the left ICA was
a clot only.  TTE was limited but TEE did not identify any
intracardic source of emboli.  Thus a hypercoaguability work up
was initiated.  Factor V leiden and Prothrombin gene mutation
studies were sent but were pending at the time of discharge. CT
torso was without evidence of malignancy.  Of note, the patient
was on estrogen/progesterone replacement therapy and this may
have been a cause of hypercoagubility. This has been
discontinued.

The patient was started on a heparin gtt and transistioned to
coumadin. She should remain on Coumadin for at least 3 months
until the clot in her carotid artery has organized with the
vessel wall and to prevent any stump emboli. In addition,
Coumadin might be indicated even beyond that period, since she
she has an embolic appearing stroke, but the source for her
embolism is unknown at this time.  Because her INR was only 1.5
at the time of discharge, she should be continued on lovenox
until therapeutic INR is obtained.

On arrival, the patient was initially unable to speak, follow
commands and had a dense right hemiparesis.  Over the course of
her hospitalization, this improved significantly and she
developed much better strength on her left side.  Though she
remains non-fluent, the patient's comprehension has improved and
she can follow simple commands.  She is able to state her name.
Her [**Location (un) 1131**] is better than her directed speech and spontaneous
speech is at times very clear and up to 6 words. Speech/Swallow
eval the day of discharge showed continued aspiration with thin
liquids, also noted with impaired mastication due to limited
dentition. She should remain on current diet of nectar-thick
liquids and pureed solids. She will
will benefit from intensive speech, language, and swallowing
services at rehab facility to address dysphagia and aphasia.
She will continue to need agressive PT/OT as well.

# ETOH Abuse: The patient's family reported a history of alcohol
use of up to 5 brandys per night.  She was maintained on a CIWA
alcohol assessment scale with no signs of withdrawal through her
hospitalization.

# Falls: The patient fell out of her bed twice in the initial
days out of the ICU.  The patient appeared to have difficulty
understanding the requirements for staying in bed. Repeat CT
scans after these falls did not demonstrate any signs of
hemorrhage.

# Cardiovascular:  The patient was kept on telemetry and did not
have any evidence of arrhythmia.  Cardiac ischemia was ruled out
by cardiac enzymes x 3.  TEE was normal as above.

# Endo: Fasting lipid panel was notable fro LDL 66.  A1C was
5.4.

# Pulmonary:  The patient has a history of asthma, and was kept
on albuterol PRN.
