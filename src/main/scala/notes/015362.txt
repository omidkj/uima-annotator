History of Present Illness:
77M h/o recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma s/p chemotherapy
session on [**2134-3-19**] presenting from rehab ([**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) **]) with
Tm of 102.2 as well as hypoxia to 78% on room air.
.
Per facility report, patient originally presented on [**2134-2-23**]
after recent hospitalziation for GIB from diverticulitis and
espohagitis.  Patient was doing well with therapy, with good
appetite and progression with rehab.  On Friday, [**3-19**] patient
went for chemotherapy.  Day prior to presentation, had a low
grade temperature around 99.  The next day, patient spiked to
102F.  BP reported to be 80/44.  Also of note, patient was
dyspnic, SOB with "congestion" on lung auscultation saturating
78% on room air.  Per report, wife mentioned patient had had PNA
after chemotherapy session in the past.
.
Regarding his recent hospitalizations, patient was recently
diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, and began treatment with
carboplatin/taxol on [**2133-12-10**].  He also has been receiving
radiation therapy.  He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for
hypoxia, and was diagnosed with a PE based on EKG earlier in
[**2133**] with EKG findings of S1, Q3, T3, TTE showing right heart
strain and elevated d dimer ([**Numeric Identifier 43132**]), and treated with
enoxaparin.  He was recently seen at [**Hospital1 18**] at the beginning of
the month with a GIB ultimately deemed to be a diverticular
bleed while on enoxaparin.  His anticoagulation was
discontinued, and an IVC filter was placed.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T99.4 HR116 BP98/43 RR18 satting
94% on 4L NP.  Labs showed a WBC of 6.3 with 86% PMN's (around
baseline), HCT of 31.3 (baseline), normal coags, creatinine of
1.6 (baseline 1.1), Lactate of 1.6, AST of 77/ALT of 24 with the
rest of his liver tests within normal limits.  A UA was
performed which was positive for LE, 124 WBCs, few bacteria and
yeast, and <1 epi.  Urine and blood cultures were performed.
Patient received 1 gram of vancomycin 1000 mg meropenem.

On arrival to the ICU, T 99.5, HR 103, BP 99/47, RR of 21
satting 95% on 2L NC.  Patient is AOx3, but lethargic and having
rigors.

Oncologic History:
-presented with 35-pound weight loss, RLL PNA [**2133-10-8**],
persistent on CXR [**2133-11-3**], with CT [**2133-11-6**] showing mass-like
RLL consolidation with hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy
-bronchoscopy [**2133-11-25**]: bronchial brushings and EBUS-TBNA of
stations 4L, 7, 4R and 11R all positive for adenocarcinoma, with

.
Tbbx of RLL negative.
-PET [**2133-12-1**]:
1. FDG-avid mass-like consolidation throughout the right lower
lobe and FDG-avid right supraclavicular, hilar and subcarinal
lymphadenopathy.
2. Markedly increased FDG-avidity in the region of the dorsum
sellae without anatomic correlate, though only partially
assessed, MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
3. Large fat-containing left inguinal hernia.
-carboplatin/taxol started [**2133-12-31**], on concurrent XRT

Reports
CXR [**3-21**]

FINDINGS: Lung volumes are low. There is stable appearance of a
right lower lobe mass and hilar adenopathy consistent with known
history of neoplasm.  Presence of an superimposed consolidation
cannot be entirely excluded, but is likely. There is no obvious
consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. A right-sided
Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the right atrium.

IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes, stable appearance of right lower
lobe mass and associated adenopathy.
