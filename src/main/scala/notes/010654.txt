Attending:[**Doctor First Name 7926**]
Chief Complaint:
CHF exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
56-year-old man with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%)
s/p ICD, CAD s/p post stenting of the LAD and RCA, and pAF w/ a
recent L femoral artery injury during an afib ablation procedure
(aborted for emergency vascular surgery), who presents with
worsening dyspnea, orthopnea.  The patient is currently on
dofetilide 2.5mg daily, but has remained in atrial fibrillation.
 His atrial fibrillation has been accompanied by progressive CHF
exacerbations, marked by paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea
(1-> 2 pillows), and lower extremity edema.  The patient's afib
has slow ventricular response causing him to be V-paced.  The
patient has been cardioverted many times, last [**1-8**], without
effect.
.
The patient currently denies shortness of breath, cough, wheeze,
chest pain, palpitations.  Last episode of PND last night.  He
feels that his lower extremity edema has been progressive over
the past month.  He continues to have an open left lower
extremity wound that has been weeping profusely with increase in
edema.  Wound recently s/p dermabond and suturing by vascular
surgery.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
Patient states that he is always cold.  Denies any prior history
of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis,
black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is positive for paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, and ankle edema.  It is
notable for absence of chest pain, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Chest PA/Lat [**2112-1-16**]:  Previous dense consolidation in the left
lower lobe has improved since early [**Month (only) 1096**]. Presumably this
was atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions remain, and
there is still pulmonary vascular engorgement but no clear
pulmonary edema. The new transvenous left ventricular pacer lead
ends high along the lateral wall of the left ventricle close to
the projection of the interventricular septum. Two transvenous
right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads and a right atrial
pacer lead are all unchanged in their respective positions.
There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening to indicate any
complication.
.
ECHO [**2112-1-18**]:  Severely dilated left ventricle with severely
depressed global left ventricular systolic function. Dilated,
mildly hypokinetic right ventricle. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Diastolic
pulmonary hypertension.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-9-30**],
