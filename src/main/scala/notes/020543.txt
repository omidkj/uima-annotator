History of Present Illness:
Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 23227**] is a 74 yoF with a history of HTN and &
hypothyroidism, who presented to the ED this morning with
rigors. Ten days ago she fell and lacerated her RLE; she was
treated initially with Keflex 500 mg TID x 10 days by the ED at
[**Hospital6 33**] where she also had stitches done (tetanus
booster was also given). On [**2-28**] she was seen at [**Company 191**] for removal
of the stitches and was noted to have some drainage from the
wound; she was switched to Bactrim DS 1 tab [**Hospital1 **]. This morning,
she awoke febrile, with worsening erythema, and with rigors.
.
In the ED, VS were T 102.1, BP 134/73, HR 104, RR 22, 97% on RA.
Labs were notable for a leukocytosis of 12,000, a lactate of
3.3, and an elevated BUN to 27. A UA, and CXR were negative for
any other infectious sources, and films of the ankle were
negative for any signs of osteomyelitis. The patient was given
1L of NS and 1g of vancomycin.
.
On the floor, she remained febrile; HR 110; BP 90-110's. She was
given 2 L NS. She was transferred to the MICU briefly for
observation with borderline BP and elevated lactate. On arrival,
she was c/o her chronic back and neck pain as well as nausea.
She denied SOB, CP, abd pain.

Studies:
.
Chest PA and LAT ([**3-3**]): Since [**2169-2-9**], bibasilar opacities
increased, likely atelectasis, very less likely bibasilar
pneumonia. Incidentally, an azygos lobe is present, a normal
variant. Bilateral upper lobe opacities are likely artifactual,
due to a different technique. There is no pleural effusion. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.
.
TTE ([**3-2**]): The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. No significant valvular abnormalities. No vegetations
identified. If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation
by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
.
Right Leg MRI ([**3-5**]): (dictated report) No evidence of
osteomyelitis or soft tissue abscess.
.
Bilateral Lower Extremity Doppler Ultrasound ([**3-6**]): 1. No left
or right lower extremity DVT. 2. [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst on the right, as
described on MRI of the calf, [**2169-3-6**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A 74 year-old woman presenting with clear signs of a systemic
infection, including fevers, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and
elevated lactate. Likely source is right leg cellulitis.
.
1. Infection, cellulitis.
At admission, she had significant pain and erythema at the site
of the right leg laceration. Her systemic symptoms were felt to
be due to inflammatory response from the cellulitis. She was
admitted to the MICU overnight for monitoring given concern of
SIRS (tachycardia, tachypnea, lactic acidosis), and started
empirically on IV vancomycin. The next morning she returned to
the medicine floors with stable vitals and resolved acidosis.
The area of cellulitis had also decreased substantially in size.
She continued to have intermittent episodes of chills, with
fevers up to 101, on the vancomycin. Blood cultures were
repeatedly drawn, and these all returned negative (including
cultures taken from the ED). Urine cultures were also negative.
She underwent transthoracic echo for concern of endocarditis.
This showed normal ejection fraction with no valvular
vegetations. Once therapeutic on the vanco, her fever curve
began down-trending, although she continued to have occasional
episodes of chills. She underwent right leg MRI which showed no
evidence of osteomyelitis. She also had lower extremity dopplers
that were negative for DVT. Liver enzymes were checked for
concern of alcalculous cholecystitis; these were mildly elevated
but consistent with her baseline transaminitis, likely from
NAFLD. After five days of vancomycin, with no positive culture
data, we switched her to oral Linezolid to complete a fourteen
day course. At time of discharge, she has not had fevers in over
24 hours. Her last recorded fever was 100.0. She had a markedly
elevated CRP (222) during this admission, and it is felt her
fevers and chills are due to a prolonged inflammatory response
to the cellulitis. Symptomatically she feels improved, and her
cellulitis is resolving.
.
2. Hypertension.
Her atenolol-chlorthalidone was held at admission due to
hypotension in the setting of possible sepsis. Once stable on
the floors, her antihypertensive was restarted without
complication.
.
3. Hypothyroidism.
