HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiac cath showed an ejection fraction of
30%, mitral regurgitation, three vessel disease.  Pulmonary
medicine was consulted due to patient's pulmonary problems.
Pulmonary function tests were obtained.  Chest x-ray was
obtained.  ABG was obtained.  It was decided per these
results to take patient to the operating room.  Patient was
operated on [**2172-5-7**].  Coronary artery bypass times two was
performed with LIMA to LAD and 5 mm [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex graft to distal
RCA.  Patient appeared to tolerate the procedure all right
and was transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery ICU
postoperatively.  She had chest tubes and pacing wires in
place.  She initially required a Levophed drip.  She was
started on beta blockers, digoxin.  She received vancomycin
times four perioperatively.  Patient was started on captopril
in addition to digoxin and Lopressor.  She was recoumadinized
with a temporary heparin drip.  She was also started on Lasix
to help treat her extensive positive fluid status.

The patient was transferred to the regular cardiothoracic
floor on [**2172-5-11**] in good condition, chest tubes and pacing
wires having already been removed.  Lopressor was increased
to improve her blood pressure.  Physical therapy has worked
extensively with patient and has judged that patient would
benefit greatly from outpatient rehab.  It is now [**2172-5-12**] and
