Brief Hospital Course:
66yo female w/ h/o rheumatic heart disease, HTN, DM2 presenting
with indigestion following exertion, severe anemia and guaiac
positive stool.
.
#. Anemia: Likely from a slow ooze, considering she has not
noticed a change in her bowel movements, and is relatively well
compensated for a Hct of 18. She was originally started on a
pantoprazole infusion, which was switched to pantoprazole 40mg
[**Hospital1 **]. She had peripheral IVs for access. The morning after
admission had a small, tarry stool. Her Hct originally came up
to 22, then transfused two more units PRBCs with Hct to 28.
Upper endoscopy showed a large, ulcerated, bleeding mass in the
antrum highly suspicious for gastric carcinoma.  A repeat
endoscopy was performed after stabilization of her hematocrit,
and pathology showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The
patient was set up with oncology follow-up for possible
neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and partial gastrectomy.  The patient
received a total of 8 units of PRBCs and her hematocrit was
stable at discharge.
.
#. SOB and dyspepsia with exertion: almost definitely related to
severe anemia, however story also suspicious for ACS. EKG shows
possible mild strain, but not ACS. Troponins were negative, and
mild ST depressions resolved. Once she was hemodynamically
stable she was restarted on her metoprolol pre-op.
.
#. Diabetes: While NPO she was kept on a reduced lantus dose
with a humalog sliding scale.  Her lantus was titrated up back
to her home dose once no longer NPO.
.
# CAD: continued rosuvastatin. Stopped Aspirin in setting of GI
bleed.
.
# Asthma: continued montelukast and fluticasone

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mrs. [**Known lastname 50155**],

You were admitted to the hospital because you had a GI bleed.
You had an endoscopy that showed that unfortunately showed that
you have gastric cancer.  You were seen by our oncologists, who
feel that you will likely need chemotherapy and surgery in order
to treat this cancer.
