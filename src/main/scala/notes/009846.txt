History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 77 yo female w/ a PMHx significant for HTN,

office today when she felt acute onset of chest/back pain.  She
states that she was walking out of the office when she felt some
pain in the middle of her back that was [**7-25**].  Pt states that
she felt slightly short of breath with additional pain that
radiated from her arm and jaw and went into her chest.  She

the past few months that were worse with exertion and improved
with rest.  She did not experience any lightheadedness,
diaphoresis, or heart palpitations.  Pt reports having the
feeling of a racing heart in the past.  After her this episode,
the patient had an EKG taken at the office and was sent the [**Hospital1 **]
emergency room.

In the clinic, pt had an EKG that showed 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevation in
V1-V3.  In the ED she was given nitro gtt, ASA, heparin gtt,
integrillin gtt, and she was seen by cardiology who emergently
took the patient to the cath lab.  She was found to have a 99%
occluded LAD that was sucessfully stented.  Pt was then
transferred to the CCU for further evaluation/observation.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo female w/ PMHx of DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, meningioma p/w
anterior STEMI s/p LAD stent.

CV - 1 VD s/p stent

CAD - In the ED she was given Nitro gtt, ASA, heparin gtt,
Integrilin gtt, and she was seen by cardiology who emergently
took the patient to the cath lab.  Catheterization showed 99%
stenosis of LAD s/p stent placement.  Pt [**Name (NI) **] peaked at [**2077**].
She was maintained on aspirin, beta blocker, Statin, and
Integrilin for 18 hours post catheterization.
.
Pump - Echocardiography post-stent showed anterior and distal
septal hypokinesis and apical dyskinesis w/ an apical left
ventricular aneurysm.  In light of aneurysm, pt was deemed to
require anticoagulation on Coumadin for 1 month with a goal INR
of 1.8-2.5 along with low dose ASA and Plavix.  Pt was
discharged on Lovenox injections as a bridge to therapeutic
Coumadin levels.
.
Rhythm - Pt was discharged with a normal sinus rhythm and had no
significant events on telemetry.
.
DM - Glucose was initially managed with an insulin drip for
tight glycemic control.  Once she was stabilized and transferred
to the floor she placed back on her outpatient glipizide along
with regular insulin sliding scale.  She was discharged on just
glipizide.
.
MS changes/Meningioma - Neurosurgery followed patient throughout
hospitalization and agreed to one month of anticoagulation.  On
[**1-2**] pt was found to be acutely confused and not oriented x 1,
a sitter was obtained for the night.  In the morning of [**1-3**]
the patient was A&O x3.  However, in light of her
anticoagulation on Coumadin, aspirin, and Plavix - a head CT was
obtained to r/o an acute bleed.  The head CT was negative.  U/A
and urine cx was also sent.  U/A was negative for leuk esterace
and nitrates.  Urine gram stain showed few PMN's.  It was
determined that patient did not have a UTI.  The patient was
instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in the brain tumor clinic in
order to reschedule removal of the meningioma.
