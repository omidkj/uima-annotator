Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
female admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a
3-day history of gross hemoptysis.

She was admitted to [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital from [**11-28**]
through [**12-4**] for congestive heart failure with large
bilateral pleural effusions, responded well to diuresis.  A
transthoracic echocardiogram was done at that time revealing
moderate aortic stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, mild
mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonary hypertension.
After discharge, she felt well at home but then developed
blood-tinged sputum on [**2178-12-6**], that progressed to
coughing up large clots of blood.  She presented to the
[**Hospital 26200**] Hospital Emergency Department where a chest
x-ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate.  The patient was
afebrile at that time.  Of note, the patient was not
anticoagulated, and she had stopped taking aspirin on
[**2178-12-7**] in anticipation of an outpatient
colonoscopy on the week of admission (scheduled to
investigate iron deficiency anemia).  She was started on
levofloxacin and Flagyl on [**12-9**] for a questionable
pneumonia.

On [**2178-12-10**], she underwent bronchoscopy which
revealed a brisk bleed in the left lower lobe with overflow
of blood into the right lower lobe.  No definite lesions were
seen at that time.  She remained hemodynamically stable
despite a hematocrit drop from 36 to 30, and thus was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The family reports that at most she
vomited a cup full of blood followed by teaspoon amounts.
The patient admits to a 30-pound weight loss this summer
without intention.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission to
Medical Intensive Care Unit blood pressure was 163/45, heart
rate 68, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 97% on 40% face
mask.  In general, nontoxic, alert and oriented times three,
in no acute distress with a raspy voice.  Head and neck
examination revealed no jugular venous distention.  Bilateral
carotid bruits versus transmitted murmur.  Mucous membranes
were dry.  Tongue was red with dry blood.  Lungs had
decreased anterior motion and faint crackles in right lower
lobe, dullness at left lower lobe.  Otherwise clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular revealed a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border
with harsh crescendo-decrescendo, a 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur at the left sternal border, a regular rate and rhythm.
Normal first heart sound and second heart sound auscultated.
No audible third heart sound.  Soft fourth heart sound
(equivocal).  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended,
good bowel sounds in all four quadrants.  Extremities
revealed 2+ distal pulses.  No edema.  Neurologic examination
was nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission
to Medical Intensive Care Unit revealed a white blood cell
count of 10.9, hemoglobin 9.6, hematocrit 28.9,
platelets 422.  PT 13.8, PTT 29.4, INR 1.3.  Sodium 141,
potassium 3.8, chloride 102, bicarbonate 33, BUN 16,
creatinine of 0.7, glucose of 129.  ALT 27, AST 23.  Creatine
kinase 24.  Alkaline phosphatase 76, total bilirubin 0.9,
albumin 3.3.  Calcium 8.8, phosphorous 3.4, magnesium 1.5.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram dated [**12-9**] from
outside hospital revealed normal sinus rhythm at 77 beats per
minute, axis -40 degrees, borderline first-degree AV block,
Q wave in III and aVF, 1-mm ST segment elevation in lead III
and aVF (old), 1-mm ST segment depression in I and aVL, V2
through V5 (old).

A chest x-ray from outside hospital revealed left-sided
consolidation, enlarged cardiac silhouette, no obvious mass.
No congestive heart failure.

Chest CT from outside hospital revealed left lingular
consolidation, areas of emphysema.  No mass.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was a 77-year-old female
presenting with a 3-day history of hemoptysis with a
hematocrit drop from 36 to 29, status post bronchoscopy on
the a.m. of transfer to Medical Intensive Care Unit.

The bronchoscopy showed a "brisk bleed" in the left lower
lobe with spillage into the right lower lobe.  On transfer,
the patient was hemodynamically stable without active
hemoptysis.  The differential diagnosis of the hemoptysis in
the patient included, but was not limited to:
(1)  Bronchogenic carcinoma given her history of smoking and
weight loss, although no mass was identified by bronchoscopy
or CT.  (2)  Infection, although the patient was afebrile
with normal white blood cell count.  The patient could have
had a loculated abscess or fungus ball.  (3)  Pulmonary
embolus given her recent hospitalization and immobilization.
(4)  Pulmonary hypertension of unclear etiology.  (5)  Mitral
regurgitation or mitral stenosis given her history of
rheumatic fever.  (6)  Arteriovenous malformation.

Given the patient's relatively instability and risk of
embolus from her diseased and calcified aorta, the Medical
Intensive Care Unit team held off on getting a bronchial
arteriogram, and the patient was managed as follows:

1.  PULMONARY:  The patient was given supplemental oxygen to
keep her oxygen saturation above 92%.  In case respiratory
decompensation, the plan was to consider intubation with a
double lumen endotracheal tube with selective intubation of
the right main stem bronchus with positioning of the patient
in the left lateral decubitus position.  The patient was
given albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer therapy p.r.n.   The
plan was for Interventional Radiology to perform an angiogram
if the patient had an acute hematocrit drop.

A chest x-ray was done showing no change from the prior study
with left-sided consolidation.  While in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit the patient had an episode of submassive
hemoptysis.  A bronchoscopy was done showing 100 cc of blood
from the area of the left lingula spilling into the right
main stem bronchus.  Cardiothoracic Surgery and
Interventional Radiology were aware of the case and were on
board in case of a massive bleed.  The patient was observed,
and ther
