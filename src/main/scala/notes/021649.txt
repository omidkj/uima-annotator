HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year-old
female with a past medical history significant for breast
cancer status post left mastectomy with known metastases to
lung and pericardium status post multiple drainages who
presents with acute shortness of breath.  The patient had
recently been admitted to [**Hospital1 188**] [**2-25**] through the 8th for shortness of breath,
congestive heart failure and acute renal failure.  She was
thought to be in acute congestive heart failure, diuresed and
then discharged to [**Hospital1 **].  Following her discharge from
[**Hospital1 **] the patient noted gradually progression of her
shortness of breath "my heart building up water."  She noted
dyspnea on exertion after approximately 10 feet of walking on
room air.  Her symptoms were improved on oxygen nasal
cannula.  This is much changed from her baseline of walking
several 100 feet before fatigue.  Her review of systems was
also positive for decreased appetite, mild weight gain with
increased lower extremity edema and increased abdominal
girth. The patient was admitted for management of her
shortness of breath.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.3.  Blood
pressure 130/62.  Pulse 84.  Respirations 22.  O2 sat 93% on
4 liters of oxygen nasal cannula.  Physical examination
general elderly female sitting up in bed in no acute
distress.  HEENT pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.  JVD
to 7 cm.  Neck without lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular
regular rate and rhythm.  3 out of 6 crescendo murmur heard
best at the left upper sternal border.  Lungs decreased
breath sounds at bilateral bases.  Diffuse expiratory
wheezes.  Abdomen obese, soft, nontender, nondistended with
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities trace lower extremity
edema.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 6.7,
hematocrit 32.3, platelets 284, sodium 140, potassium 4.7,
chloride 91, bicarb 41, BUN 32, creatinine 1.1, glucose 166.
CT angio negative for PE, increased pleural effusion left
greater then right, persistent pericardial effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Dyspnea:  The patient admitted with
acute and progressive shortness of breath.  She had baseline
bilateral pleural effusions.  CT of the chest showed an
interval increase in these effusions.  The patient underwent
thoracentesis on her left side on [**3-18**] with approximately
300 cc of fluid removed.  Initial pleural studies were
consistent with an exudate with cytology pending at the time
of discharge.  The patient did have symptomatic improvement
following thoracentesis.  She then developed mild respiratory
distress with hypercarbia.  She was briefly placed on BiPAP
with improvement of symptoms.  She was then weaned off of
BiPAP and maintained on oxygen via nasal cannula.  The
patient was initially considered for pleurodesis, however,
following discussion with the family the patient decided she
did not desire any further treatment for her recurrent
pleural effusions.

2.  Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction:  The
patient initially admitted with mild congestive heart
failure.  She was maintained on Hydralazine and Imdur for
after load reduction.  She also was gently diuresed with
intravenous Lasix.  She also was maintained on a
beta-blocker, statin and aspirin.  She had an echocardiogram
showing no significant change from previous studies with
significant tricuspid regurgitation and mitral regurgitation.
The patient was initially maintained on her cardiac
medications, however, with decision to progress to CMO status
these were discontinued.

3.  Glaucoma:  The patient was maintained on her eye drops
for glaucoma as per her outpatient regimen.

4.  Diabetes:  Patient maintained on sliding scale insulin
initially with her blood sugars essentially normoglycemic.
As the patient progressed to CMO status she did not desire
further finger stick monitoring and this was discontinued.

5.  Chronic renal insufficiency:  Patient admitted with
elevated creatinine thought to be due to over diuresis.  Po
intake with intravenous fluids was encouraged.  Creatinine
then trended down back to her baseline.  She maintained
excellent urine output.

6.  Oncology:  Patient with metastatic breast cancer with
known mets to lung and pericardium.  She has had multiple
admissions for this and with persistent reaccumulation of
pleural effusions.  The patient decided she did not desire
further treatment for her breast cancer and that she instead
wished palliative care.  She was discharged to hospice.  The
patient was given morphine as needed for her pain and
respiratory distress.

DISPOSITION:  Following lengthy discussion with the patient,
patient's family and multiple physicians involved in her care
the patient decided that she wished to be made CMO.  She did
not desire any aggressive interventions for management of her
cancer, dyspnea, cardiovascular disease or other issues.  She
wished to be managed in a way as to maintain her comfort.
Per her wishes laboratory draws were discontinued.  In
addition, her maintenance medications were discontinued.  She
was maintained on morphine for pain and respiratory distress.
She also was maintained on oxygen as needed for comfort.  The
patient was evaluated by Health Care [**Hospital 94111**] Hospice
Service with plans to be discharged into their care.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ativan .5 to 2 mg q 4 hours prn sublingual dispense 2 cc
of 5 mg per cc elixir.
2.  Levsin .125 to .25 mg q 4 to 6 hours prn sublingual
dispense 2 cc of .25 mg per cc elixir.
3.  Morphine concentrate 5 to 20 mg q one to two hours prn
sublingual dispense 2 cc of 50 mg per cc elixir.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient is discharged into care of
hospice and the remainder of her medical management will be
