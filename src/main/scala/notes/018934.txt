Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory failure s/p airway fire

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
rigid bronchoscopy
bronchoscopy
placement of arterial line
placement of right IJ central venous line

History of Present Illness:
67yo woman with h/o tobacco use, breast CA, who presented to [**Hospital 2586**] Hosp on [**2160-4-22**] with dyspnea, cough and
blood-streaked sputum x 4d, found to have R main stem bronchus
(RMSB) near obstruction, underwent laser resection [**4-24**]
complicated by intraoperative airway fire and extensive
endobronchial burn, now in resp failure s/p trach, transferred
for trach revision and second opinion.
.
Patient's CT scan at OSH showed a near obstructing RUL lung
mass, which on subsequent biopsy turned out to be a squamous
cell CA. She also had a breast biopsy recently which returned as
infiltrating ductal CA. On [**4-24**], she underwent a laser resection
of her lung mass in a palliative attempt to open up her RLL, RML
and RUL. They were able to open her RLL and RML, though upon
trying to open the RUL and while at 22% oxygen concentration an
airway fire occurred. The IP MD put his mouth on the ETT and
blew out the fire, though it lasted [**6-28**] secs in his opinion. She
suffered an extensive endobronchial burn injury. Subsequent to
that, she developed a large R pleural effusion, underwent
CT-guided drainage with pigtail cath placement, which itself was
complicated by a tension PTX, leading to eventual chest tube
placement. She was later felt to have a L PTX from barotrauma,
and underwent a L chest tube placement. A tracheostomy was
performed.
.
On [**5-8**], on a repeat bronch, it was noted that the patient had
narrowing of the R main stem bronchus again, severely limiting
her airflow. They dilated the RMSB and placed an uncovered 8mm x
30mm metal stent in the RMSB, expecting to occlude the RUL but
maintain the patency of the RLL and RML. Subsequent bronch
showed tumor starting to grow in the distal trachea, distorting
the opening of the R main bronchus.  She then underwent [**2-23**]
treatments to this area with external beam XRT. Despite this,
her resp status worsened, with increasing tachypnea and air
hunger, which they felt was from near obstruction of the distal
trachea as visualized by another bronch.

A meeting was held with the patient's friend [**Name (NI) 27272**] [**Name (NI) **], who
felt that the pt would not want further measures taken, and so
the patient was made DNR/DNI. However, the patient's previously
estranged daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 27273**] was [**Name (NI) 653**], and she stated that
she wanted the patient to continue to receive maximal care
except for electric shocks and CPR.  Furthermore, she wanted the
pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a second opinion and possible
therapeutic measures.  As [**Doctor First Name 27272**] was not officially the HCP, and
the daughter the next-of-[**Doctor First Name **], the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**]. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] is the accepting physician.

Past Medical History:
1. Single episode of seizure of unclear etiology 20 years ago
with negative workup.
2. Supraventricular tachycardia.
3. Depression.
4. Arthritis.
5. Breast CA
6. Lung CA

Social History:
The patient smoked one to two packs a day for more than 40 years
(100+ packyears), quit [**2-25**].  No history of alcohol.  Lives with
friend of five years, [**Name (NI) 27272**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 27274**], who by the
pt's will should be the pt's HCP, though no HCP form was signed
by patient. Patient's daughter (previously estranged), [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 27273**] [**Telephone/Fax (2) 27275**]w, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 27276**], lives in CT but recently
became involved again in her mother's care and is the NOK
(default HCP), wants aggressive measures taken.

sclerosis.  Father died of a CVA.

Brief Hospital Course:
67yo woman with lung CA, extensive endobronchial burn from
airway fire with resultant resp failure, admitted for rigid
bronchoscopy.  During her hospitalization the following issues
were addressed:
.
#Hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure:  This was felt
to be due to combination of lung injury from smoke inhalation
with capillary leak, bilateral pneumonia, volume overload and
airway disease secondary to lobar collapse with lung cancer.
She underwent rigid bronchoscopy in the OR [**2160-6-4**] with
debridement of eschar, removal of RMS stent in pieces and
replacement of tracheostomy. Extensive pseudomembranes were seen
mid-trachea down to distal LLL. Lingula was obstructed with
pseudomembranes.  She required pressure control ventilation with
maximum pressure and oxygenation support.  Repeat bronchoscopy
[**2160-6-4**] showed diffuse eschar with with sluffing mucosa, lingula
obstructed by pseudomembrane, no bleeding.  She was diuresed as
blood pressure tolerated, but by day three became hypotensive
requiring pressor support.  LENIs were performed to evaluate for
PE and were negative.  She was too unstable to go to the CT
scanner as she desaturated on FiO2 of 80% with any movement.
She was treat
