Chief Complaint:
Weakness

ACDF

History of Present Illness:
49 year-old man with PMH DM type I, HTN, ESRD on HD for 4
years now s/p kidney transplantation [**9-/2141**] complicated by
delayed graft function who p/w pain in both hands, radicular
type
pain in his right leg, diffuse weakness, mostly proximal; R>L.

Patient had a renal transplant in [**9-/2141**] complicated by delayed
graft function. He also developed 3 weeks after transplant pain
in both his hands, he described as a "pricky" sensation in all
fingers and palm of his hands. He denied numbness. At that time
he had an elevated level of Prograf; ([**12-21**]; 47.8); reduction
of
medication dosing correlated with improvement in his hand pain.
He reports that he has had for several years decreased sensation
in both feet.

He has lost a significant amount of weight since his transplant
(around 30 pounds); he feels weaker throughout. He has had more
difficulty to walk; he has had more frequent falls (last one
today, he thought he tripped over on the floor). He also has
complaints of worsening pain irradiating through the right leg,
posteriorly, down to R foot. He also thinks that his hands and
arms are weaker bilaterally; he has had trouble to open the
bottles of his medications, to comb his hair along the past few
months.

He underwent an [**Month (only) 2841**] today performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1206**] which
revealed
progression of his polyneuropathy, but also denervation in an L5
distribution and proximal myopathic changes and was referred to
ED for admission for further work-up.

Imaging:

MRI
CERVICAL SPINE: Bone marrow signal is abnormally hypointense on
all
sequences, similar to that seen on the prior examination and may
relate to the
patient's underlying hemosiderosis. There is 2 mm of
retrolisthesis of C3 on
4. There is extensive [**Last Name (un) 13425**]-type 2 and 3 endplate changes and to
a lesser
extent [**Last Name (un) 13425**] type 1 endplate change centered at C3-C4. No
additional marrow
signal abnormalities are appreciated.

At C2-3, there is no canal or foraminal narrowing.

At C3-4, there is a progressive spondylosis with a central disc
herniation
resulting in severe canal narrowing with cord deformity and
abnormally
increased T2 signal. There is severe bilateral foraminal
narrowing.

At C4-5, there is a spondylotic ridge with a broad central disc
herniation
resulting in moderate canal narrowing as well as mild bilateral
foraminal
narrowing. There is flattening of the ventral cord surface
without abnormal
cord signal.

At C5-6, there is a broad spondylotic ridge with a central disc
protrusion
resulting in mild canal narrowing with slight flattening of the
ventral cord
surface. There is mild bilateral foraminal narrowing, left
greater than
right.

At C6-7, there is mild spondylosis and facet arthropathy without
significant
canal or foraminal narrowing.

At C7-T1, there is no significant canal or foraminal narrowing.

IMPRESSION:

1. Severe canal and bilateral foraminal narrowing at C3-4 with
cord deformity
and abnormally increased T2 signal.

2. Moderate canal narrowing at C4-5.

3. Additional degenerative changes as detailed.


LUMBAR SPINE: Bone marrow signal is abnormally hypointense on
all sequences,
similar to that seen on the prior examination and may relate to
the patient's
underlying hemosiderosis. Sagittal alignment is satisfactory.
The conus
terminates at T12-L1. Again noted is extensive multilevel [**Last Name (un) 13425**]
type 2
endplate change with [**Last Name (un) 13425**] type 1 endplate change at L4-5 and to
a lesser
extent L5-S1. There is a rudimentary disc space at S1-2.

At L3-4, there is mild disc desiccation without significant
canal or foraminal
narrowing.

At L4-5, again noted is a disc bulge with central annular tear
and a small
inferiorly migrated disc fragment creating moderate bilateral
subarticular
zone narrowing. When combined with the facet arthropathy and
endplate spur,
there is severe right foraminal narrowing and mild left
foraminal narrowing.

At L5-S1, there is a disc bulge and facet arthropathy with a
central/left
paracentral inferiorly migrated fragment resulting in severe
narrowing of the
left subarticular zone and lateral recess with potential for
compression of
the traversing left S1 root. Additionally, there is severe
narrowing of the
left neural foramen and moderate right foraminal narrowing.

There is a right pelvic kidney.

IMPRESSION:

1. Diffusely abnormal hypointense bone marrow signal is
unchanged from the
prior study and likely relates to hemosiderosis. There are
superimposed [**Last Name (un) 13425**]
type 1 and 2 endplate changes.

2. Moderate bilateral subarticular zone narrowing at L4-5 with
s
