Attending:[**Last Name (un) 2888**]
Chief Complaint:
short of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
aortic valvuloplasty [**8-11**]

History of Present Illness:
REASON FOR TRANSFER: need for BiPAP

HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:

84 yo with critical aortic stenosis, diastolic heart failure (EF
65%), CAD admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical evaluation of AS
transferred to CCU due to need for BiPAP.

Patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with respiratory
distress, thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema. She
was initially placed on BIPAP and  diuresised with IV lasix.
Course at [**Location (un) 620**] was complicated by UTI with administration of
CTX. Her creatinine was 2.2 from 2.3 with diuresis. Her heart
rate was well controlled, and was continued on her home
metoprolol. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical evaluation
for her aortic stenosis and possible balloon aortic
valvuloplasty.

On arrival to BIDNC discussion involving mgmt of AS ensued and
decision was made to precede with ballon angioplasty on [**8-11**]. On
[**8-10**] patient triggered twice for tachypnea. Initially patient
responded to 20mgIV lasix (received a total of 40mg IV) however
again became tachypneic and less responsive so discussion was
made to transfer to the CCU for initiation of BiPAP.  Prior to
transfer patient received additional 20mg IV lasix and ipratrium
nebulizer.

Vitals on transfer were 130/50  80-90sAF  RR: 24-28 98-100
3-4LNC.

On arrival to the CCU, patient minimally interactive and patient
started on BiPAP.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,

Interventional details
The patient was placed under general anesthesia and the
procedure
was performed under TEE guidance.  The left brachial artery was
exposed by surgical technique and coronary arteriography was
performed from the left brachial artery.
The aortic valve was then crossed with a 0.014 straight wire and
a pigtail catheter was placed in the left ventricle for
simultaneous pressure recordings.
A 0.035 Amplatz SuperStiff guidewire was placed in the left
ventricle and a single balloon inflation was performed using a
18
mm Tyshak II balloon.
Immediately after balloon deflation, the patient developed
marked
hypotension.  There was no evidence of aortic regurgitation and
no evidence of pericardial fluid.
CPR was initiated but the left ventricular contractility
continued to worsen.

The patient expired at 11:11 AM.
The family was notified.

Assessment & Recommendations
1.	Severe aortic stenosis
2.	Non obstructive but diffuse coronary artery disease
3.	Unsuccessful balloon aortic valvuloplasty resulting in death

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 32651**] is a 85 y/o F with PMHx of critical aortic stenosis,
CAD, DM2, transferred to the CCU for worsening respiratory
distress who underwent aortic valvuplasty with procedure
complicated by refractory hypotension and asystolic arrest.

# PUMP: Patient with known critical AS and transferred to CCU
for monitoring of heart failure symptoms prior to valvuloplasty.
She was on bipap briefly and then given lasix IV prn for
diuresis. Pt was stabilized for 48hrs prior to procedure. She
underwent elective valvuloplasty on [**8-12**]. Unfortunately
immediately after balloon deflation, the patient developed
marked hypotension. Per cath report there was no evidence of
aortic regurgitation and no evidence of pericardial fluid. CPR
was initiated but the left ventricular contractility continued
to worsen.  Patient died on [**8-12**]. Family was n
