.
CXR in ED: Again is noted bilateral oligemia with relative
hyperlucency in both upper lung zones consistent with patient's
known history of emphysema. No focal opacities or infiltrates
are noted. There is no pleural effusion. Hilar contours,
cardiomediastinal silhouette, heart size are normal. Mild
mediastinal asymmetry is likely due to rotational factors.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process or pneumonia.
Unchanged appearance of emphysematous changes.
.
EKG: ST at 111, normal axis, no significant changes from prior.

.
Chest CT [**4-8**]:
As compared to the previous examination of [**2106-11-17**],
there
is no relevant change. Very extensive panlobular emphysema that
is slightly more predominant in the lung apices than in the lung
bases. The extent of emphysema has not increased in the
interval. A 4-5 mm partly calcified nodule located adjacent to
the bronchus supplying the lateral segment of the middle lobe is
unchanged in size. Also unchanged are the diffuse bronchial wall
irregularities. Coexisting chronic airways disease. No evidence
of pleural effusions. The number and size of the multiple
nonenlarged mediastinal lymph nodes is stable. The size of the
left-sided adrenal adenoma is unchanged.
.
TTE [**4-8**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%) Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
CTA chest [**2107-5-7**]: 1. Small left lower lobe subsegmental
pulmonary embolism. Please note poor opacification of distal
smaller subsegmental vessels. No large lobar, segmental, or
large subsegmental emboli are evident.
2. Unchanged panlobular emphysematous changes with chronic
bronchial wall thickening.


Brief Hospital Course:
46 year old female with a PMH of asthma/COPD on home O2 at 3LNC,
current smoker and HCV who is being admitted with COPD flare.
.
# COPD exacerbation: Severe COPD, continues to smoke. CXR
without infiltrate, pt. afebrile but with leukocytosis. Initial
ABG showed hypercarbia with pCO2 85 and elevated bicarb
suggestive of acute on chronic resp. acidosis. SOB likely [**2-12**]
COPD flair with PE as possible contributing factor (see below).
She initially was monitored in the ICU and started on steroids.
pCO2 improved from 85 to 71 (baseline 60).  She remained stable
and was transferred to the floor.  Continued supplemental O2 for
goal sat >90%. She was treated with albuterol and atrovent nebs,
prednisone 60 PO daily, azithromycin for 5 day course.  Advair
and spiriva were continued.
Of note, pt has missed several visits in our pulmonary clinic.
On d/c will need pulmonology followup as outpatient as well as
outpatient PFTs and consideration of testing for alpha 1
antitrypsin.  She has been given information about tobacco
cessation programs. Given extensive psychiatric history Chanitix
is likely not an optimal medication for her, Zyban may be a
possibility. Pt states that the nicotine patch helps her and has
has been using this in the hospital.
.
# PE:  Dyspnea was largely due to COPD exacerbation, as above.
However, given her hypoxia and tachycardia, CTA was done which
showed a small subsegmental PE.  Heparin gtt was started as
bridge to INR [**2-13**] with coumadin.  Dischage to home with lovenox
was not an option due to difficulty with teaching patient home
injection, as well as history of IVDU by pt and boyfriend in the
past.  Her INR was 2.8 on day of discharge, and she is set up
with home VNA to monitor INR.  Pt will need more extensive
education and reinforcement of coumadin management, which will
cont with home VNA. We had spent an extensive amount of time
with the patient teaching her about risks associated with taking
coumadin and the importance of following INR closely.  Attending
physicians also communicates with the PCP via email regarding
this.  Patient assured us that she will continue using VNA and
will follow our instructions.
.
# GAD/depression/agoraphobia: On multiple meds as outpatient
including citalopram, clonazepam, clonidine, risperdal,
divalproex, mirtazepine. Continued psych meds per home regimen.
Social work was consulted.
.
# HTN: Hypertensive on admission to 190s, however the patient
does not carry this diagnosis. Required prn hydralazine in the
MICU.  Likely at least partly due to anxiety & steroids.
Lisinopril was started, and BP control improved.  Will need
outpatient followup.
.
# Comm: boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 105617**]
.
# DISPO:  Full Code.  Discharged home at baseline o2.  INRs will
be followed with VNA and faxed to PCP for adjustments.
