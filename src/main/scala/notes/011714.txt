and his diarrhea improved somewhat.

Regarding pain, the patient had decreased amounts of pain
following chest tube removal, and his pain was well
controlled with prn oxycodone.  On the day of discharge, he
did complain of dysuria.  The patient had been treated for
prostatitis several weeks prior to admission.  A rectal
examination was done which showed an enlarged right lobe the
prostate which was nontender and without any masses.  A

nitrates and leukocyte esterase negative, and with rare
