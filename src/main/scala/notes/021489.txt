Radiology:
===========
Head CT [**2167-7-28**]: no acute pathology

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course: 58 y/o female with recent ambien
overdose, down for 2 days, complicated by rhabdo, ARF, b/l
compartment syndrome

# Acute Renal Failure - Secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Given
aggressive IVF hydration with normal saline to maintain urine
output greater than 100cc/hr. CK's trended down over her
hospital course (peak CK at OSH of 120,000) however creatinine
continued to rise from 3.2 on admission to 5.5 over first 24
hours. Bicarbonate fluids were attempted transiently to maintain
hydration and promote urine alkanalization, however this was
subsequently discontinued. Creatinine increased to a peak of 7.7
on [**8-4**], however of note, she remained non-oliguric throughout
and did not require dialysis. Fluid resucitation subsequently
stopped secondary to the development of pulmonary edema. She
responded well to IV diuresis with lasix and did not require
ventilatory support. She continued to make good urine output off
standing IV fluids. At time of discharge her creatinine had
recovered to 0.7.

# Compartment syndrome- Secondary to rhabdomyolysis requiring
bilateral fasciotomy on [**7-28**]. Wound vacs placed for drainage at
continuous pressure. Underwent closure of lateral fasciotomies
bilaterally on [**7-30**]. Medial wound not able to be closed
secondary to massive edema. Plastic surgery evaluated with plan
for closure on [**8-7**]. Of note, bloody drainage and oozing with
hematocrit down to 19-20. Blood transfusions given to maintain
hematocrit greater than 21. Leg pain controlled with morphine
PCA, then with prn morphine. She was discharged to follow-up in
Plastic Surgery clinic in ~2 weeks.

# Ambien overdose- In setting of suicide attempt. Now denies
suicidal or homicidal ideations. Serum/Urine tox negative on
admission. Psychiatry and social work consulted. Monitored with
sitter. Plan to transfer to psychiatry service after stable from
medicine standpoint for monitoring.

# ETOH abuse- Monitored for signs/symptoms of withdrawl.
Required small amounts of ativan per CIWA scale. No DT's or w/d
seizure activity.

# Bilateral DVTs- Diagnosed on outside hospital LENIs.
Ultimately, she continued to ooze so anticoagulation had to be
discontinued.  An IR-guided temporary IVC filter was placed.
The patient will need to follow up with IR for removal of IVC
filter for 3 weeks from insertion ([**2167-8-27**]).  She will
ultimately need a 6 month course of coumadin.  Upon re-starting
the coumadin she will need close monitoring of her hemtocrit to
monitor for re-bleeding.
.

# Code - Full
.
# Dispo - The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital3 **]
inpatient psychiatry service.  The follow-up appointments for
the plastic surgery department and the radiology department will
be sent to the psychiatry unit.  Also, she was given an
appointment with a new primary care physician.
