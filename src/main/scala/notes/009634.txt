[**2121-1-7**] CTA:IMPRESSION: Subarachnoid as well as subdural
hemorrhage with bifrontal hemorrhagic contusions. There is no
evidence of aneurysm. However, if there remains continued
clinical concern, consider obtaining conventional angiogram to
further evaluate for this potential pathology.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 y/o white male with history of DM and [**Hospital **] transferred from
OSH after falling
at the supermarket with (+)LOC. Pt had sz x 2 at OSH. He was
intubated and
sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of SDH and SAH found on head CT.
The patient was admitted to the ICU upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]. On
[**1-7**] he had a CTA which was negative for aneurysm.

He had some "coffee ground emesis" in his NGT on [**1-9**] and he had
a h/o previous GI bleeds, so was sent for an upper GI series.
That was negative for bleeding. The patient's respiratory status
improved and was intubated in the ICU. He remained difficult to
arouse but was neurologically stable.

On [**1-10**] was transferred to the neuro step-down unit but then had
oxygen desaturation to 78% the following day so went back to the
ICU. He was found to have pneumonia and was started on a 7-day
course of antibiotics.

On [**1-13**] his head CT showed increased edema and there appeared to
be evidence of strokes in the area of the previous hemorrhage.
There was 1.4 cm midline shift, subfalcine herniation and uncal
compression. On [**1-14**] the CT was slightly improved but the EEG
showed encephalopathy. His neuro exam remained the same until
about 4am on [**1-15**]. At that time he had an elevation in his blood
pressure, his pupils were ~4mm and only minimally reactive. He
had no gag, no motor exam, and slight corneal reflex on the
left/none on the right. The patient was sent for immediate head
CT, which was worse than the morning and showed impending
herniation. He was given 50 mg mannitol. Pt exam continued to
deteriorate.  Family wished pt to be made comfort care only.
Patient was extubated and expired.
