Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Failure to thrive.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy [**2190-12-20**]: no endobronchial lesions.  BAL: Bronchial
cells and many pulmonary macrophages.  TBNA bx: NEGATIVE FOR
MALIGNANT CELLS

BM bx [**2190-12-17**]: consistent with possible myeloproliferative
disorder.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 83M with a history of CHF (with diastolic
dysfunction, EF>55%), first degree AV block ([**Month/Day/Year 4448**] placed
[**5-18**]), intermittent atrial fibrillation, RA on chronic
prednisone, and diabetes, who now presents with decreased po
intake, increased fatigue, weight loss, insomnia, and chronic
intractable hiccups.

Pt was recently admitted for intractable hiccups, hyponatremia,
diastolic CHF exacerbation, UTI, and PNA (d/c [**2190-12-1**]).  He was
treated with compazine, IV hydration + stress dose steroids,
gentle diuresis, and levo/flagyl.  His w/u during the last
admission included chest/Ab CT that showed hilar and paraaortic
lymphadeopathy, and an abdominal ultrasound that was suspicious
for cirrhosis.

[**Name (NI) **] wife states that since discharge, the patient has been
markedly anorexic, taking only spoonfuls of food and sips of
liquids po and has only eaten one full meal since discharge.
His wife states that he has lost 40 lbs over the past 4 months,
and has lost 10 of those lbs in the past week (though she thinks
much of this is due to fluid diuresis as his peripheral [**Last Name (un) **] has
improved markedly as of late).  In addition, the hiccups
returned 3 days PTA.  The pt took 3 doses of compazine but has
had no relief.  He also complains of insomnia.  He has not noted
any other changes or complaints over this period time.

On admission, his VS were: 96.6, 80s/40s, 80s, 23, 97% RA.  He
was minimally responsive to 500 cc NS boluses x 2 followed by
IVFs with NS @100cc/hr.  Pt's BP improved to 95/50s, but no
higher.

On ROS, he denies headache, fever, chills, night sweats,
noctruria, hematuria, flank pain, abdominal pain, changes in
bowel habits, chest pain, shortness of breath, focal weakness.
He has had worsening vision over the past week, has no sense of
smell.

two children, one in the local area ([**Location (un) 745**]). Worked in auto
mechanics for many years, now retired. Previous history of heavy

Non-contributory

Physical Exam:

Gen - thin, fatigued, somnolent but arousable, lying in bed
HEENT - PEERL 3 -> 2mm bilaterally.  EOMI.  No palpable cervical
or suproclavicular LAD.  OP clear, moist.  No thyromegaly.
Cor - distant HS, RRR, S1/S2, [**3-21**] SM heard best at LLSB
Resp: CTA bilaterally, no w/r/r/c
Ab - soft, nontender, mildly distended, NABS.  Hepatomegaly to 2
cm below costal margin.  No splenomegaly appreciated.  No
masses, rebound, guarding, no bruits.
Neuro - A&O x3.  Strength 5/5 in UEs and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6816**].
Reflexes 1+ paterally bilaterally, 0 ankle jerks bilaterally,
babinski downgoing bilaterally, sensation intact to light touch
in hands and feet.
Ext - 2+ pitting edema in RLE, 1+ edema in LLE.  DPs 1+
bilaterally, PTs not palpable bilaterally.


Pertinent Results:
CT chest/abdomen [**2190-12-15**]:
1. Extensive lymphadenopathy is seen within the mediastinum and
in the
retroperitoneum. These are unchanged in comparison to prior
study. The
mediastinal lymph nodes are likely amenable to biopsy by
mediastinoscopy.
2. There are several areas of hypodensity within the spleen.
These are hard to compare to the prior study secondary to
differences in the phase of contrast enhancement. These may
represent real lesions and correlation with ultrasound is
recommended.
3. Several peripheral areas of faint ground-glass opacity are
seen, which are peripheral distribution, greater in the right
lung than the left. These are new in comparison to the prior
study, and may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, or
infectious process or lymphoma.
.
Spleen U/S [**2190-12-16**]:Enlarged spleen with innumerable hypodense
lesions. The
appearance is concerning for lymphoma.
.
L knee AP and Lateral [**2190-12-20**]:
1. No acute bony injury.
2. Small lucency at the tibia-prosthesis interface in the medial
compartment.
Comparison with remote prior examinations, which are not
currently available,
recommended to assess for interval change.
.
UNILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND [**12-21**]: No DVT.
.
CXR [**12-22**]:IMPRESSION: Minimal patchy left basilar opacity, most
likely due to atelectasis. Follow-up radiograph may be helpful
to exclude early pneumonia.
.
CT neck and LUE [**12-23**]: prelim read showing crhonic occlusion of
RIJV with abnormal filling of L subclavian and L
branchiocephalic veins, awaitin gfinal report.

Brief Hospital Course:
83M with a history of CHF (with diastolic dysfunction, EF>55%),
first degree AV block ([**Month/Day/Year 4448**] placed [**5-18**]), intermittent
atrial fibrillation, RA on chronic prednisone, and diabetes, who
now presents with decreased po intake, increased fatigue, weight
loss, insomnia, and chronic intractable hiccups.  Also with
worrisome intra-abdominal and mediastinal lymphadeopathy due to
unknown cause, continually elevated alkaline phosphatase,
hyponatremia, ARF.  Given concern for infection and early sepsis
on admission, the pt was treated with vancomycin/aztreonam,
given IV fluid resuscitation to support his BP, and transferred
to the MICU.  In the MICU he remained afebrile and studies were
negative for a source of infection.  He was taken off the stress
dose steroids and the antibiotics and he remained
hemodynamically stable.  He was then transferred back to the
floor on [**12-15**].  His hospital course by system then included:
.
#. Mediastinal and para-aortic LAD on CT chest [**11-24**].
Concerning for systemic disease given recent symptoms of
anorexia, weight loss, fatigue.  Lung CA, colon CA, HCC,
cholangioCA, lymphoma were on our ddx, though no lympho
