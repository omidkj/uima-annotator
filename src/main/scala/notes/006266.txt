Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Aortic aneurysm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2146-9-13**]: Resection and repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm
with 14-mm Dacron tube graft and distal aortic
endarterectomy.

[**2146-9-17**]: Exploratory laparotomy, sigmoid resection, and
end-colostomy.

[**2146-9-23**]: Right Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82-year-old gentleman with past medical
history significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemai, and
CAD s/p CABG [**2142**], who was recently found to have an abdominal
aortic aneurysm 3.5cm which enlarged to 4.6cm. He has previously
had a right femoral sarcoma removed and radiation therapy and
has a chronically swollen right leg.  CT angiogram showed a
heavily calcified
infrarenal aorta with 3 areas of distinct blowout, almost
looking like contained ruptures.  The largest one of this just
proximal to the renal arteries and approximately 4.6 cm in
diameter.  The aorta was heavily calcified both proximal and
distal to these areas of aneurysmal saccular degeneration
and more so at the aortic bifurcation.  Because of the unusual
saccular shape and the appearance that one of these may have
actually been an old chronic contained rupture, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
recommended open repair, as he did not have an endovascular
option.

Past Medical History:
Past Medical History:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in
[**2126**], which was treated with angioplasty at the [**Hospital3 2358**].
He
then underwent a four-vessel CABG at [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] in
[**2142**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Elevated lipids.
5.  Asthma.

Past Surgical History:  Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy
and status post right knee arthroscopy.


Social History:
Social History:  The patient is married He lives in [**Location **]
and is a former philosophy professor [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of education at
[**University/College **].  He quit
smoking a pipe back in [**2123**] and drinks approximately two wine
beverages with dinner each evening.


Family History:
No family history of aneurysms.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

CXR: Low lung volumes. Small right effusion. Increased fullness
of the right hilus and prominence of left basilar interstitial
markings may refelect mild institial pulmonary edema. Increased
density at the right base likely a summation of low lung
volumes, atelectasis, and mild edema. Stable right pleural
lipoma. Left PICC at high SVC. NG tip not seen below field of
view.

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2146-9-14**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA. Lipomatous
hypertrophy of the interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages,
defibrillator pads or electrodes. Suboptimal image quality -
body habitus.
Conclusions  The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). No regional wall motion abnormalitu seen in
suboptimal views.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted on [**2146-9-13**] for same day elective open AAA
repair. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the CVICU for monitoring. Overnight, he was hypotensive
requiring vasopressors and febrile to 101.7. Blood,sputum, and
urine cultures were sent and he was started on empiric
