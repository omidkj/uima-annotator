Service:  TRAUMA

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 38821**] is a 41-year-old man
who fell approximately 40 feet from a ladder.  There is a
question if there was an electrocution injury secondary to
contact with a wire.  The patient loss consciousness at the
scene and was found to be opening his eyes spontaneously, but
confused and combative.  He was intubated at the scene and
sedated with Versed.  He was boarded and collared and arrived
at the [**Hospital6 256**] hemodynamically
stable with a GCS of 3T.

PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORIES:  At the time of
admission, past medical, past surgical histories were
unknown.

MEDICATION:  Lipitor

ALLERGIES:  None known

EXAM:
GENERAL:  The patient was intubated and sedated.
VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate 104, pulse 120/palp, 100% on being
bagged.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  His pupils were equal.
His tympanic membrane on the right was bloody.  He had a
right raccoon eye.
BACK:  Cervical spine, no step-off.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.
HEART:  Regular.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nontender.  The pelvis was stable.
EXTREMITIES:  There were no obvious deformities of the
extremities.  Small superficial laceration on the left elbow
and left fifth finger.
RECTAL:  Heme negative with decreased tone.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  White count 19, hematocrit 41.  Normal
chemistries.  INR of 1.5.  Arterial blood gases 7.33, 46, 81,
25 and -1.  CK of 289.

TRAUMA WORK UP:  Head CT revealed a right cerebellar and left
temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with right posterior
fossa and subarachnoid blood.  There is no herniation, but
effacement of the cisterns.  There are multiple bilateral
temporal fractures, right occipital fracture, right orbital
fracture and right subdural hematoma.  Abdominal CT showed no
evidence of injury.  Small anterior right pneumothorax.
Right 5th and 10th rib fractures and right 1st or 5th lumbar
transverse process fractures.  CT of the chest showed no
aortic injury, question of T11-T12 compression deformity and
right 1st, 4th, 5th and 6th rib fractures.  Hand elbow films
showed no fracture or dislocation.  Neurosurgical and
oral maxillofacial consultations were obtained in the trauma
bay.  Neurosurgery placed a vault that showed an ICP of
greater than 40.  A post procedure head CT showed increased
cerebellar hemorrhage and the patient was taken emergently to
the Operating Room for evacuation.  The patient underwent a
suboccipital craniectomy with resection of right subdural
bleeding and dural expansion.  He was taken intubated and
sedated to the trauma Intensive Care Unit where the rest of
his course will be summarized by system.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  NEUROLOGIC:  The patient had undergone injuries as
described above and went to the Operating Room for evacuation
of the hematoma.  A ventricular ostomy drain was placed in
the Operating Room and it was continued until approximately
[**2111-4-10**].  The patient slowly regained motor function of
initially of his left upper and lower extremities followed by
his right upper and lower extremities.  Follow up head CT did
not show any extension of bleeding.  Of note, the patient
remained sedated for an extended period of time given his
multiple injuries.  As the sedation was weaned, he initially
had difficulty with agitation and difficulty weaning the
propofol, however this eventually resolved and at the time of
dictation the patient requires no sedation.  The cervical
spine was cleared with an MRI.  His thoracic and lumbar
spines were cleared with CT scans.  CT did reveal an L4
vertebral body corner fracture and L1 through 5 right
transverse process fractures which are not treated
operatively.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient never had hemodynamic
instability throughout his course and required no pressors or
drips for blood pressure control.

3.  RESPIRATORY:  The patient was intubated on arrival at the
[**Hospital6 256**].  He remained on vent
support during the course of his stay due to his sedation.
His clinical course improved.  He was weaned to extubation on
[**2111-4-5**], however he quickly developed upper airway stridor
and respiratory distress and was reintubated.  A percutaneous
tracheostomy was placed at the bedside on [**2111-4-6**].  After
this point, the patient continued on vent support while he
was sedated.  Once sedation was weaned, he was weaned to
trach mask.  At the time of dictation, he has been on trach
mask for approximately 2.5 days.  His respiratory course is
complicated by right middle lobe and right lower lobe
pneumonia.  Culture data showed this to be Enterobacter which
was resistant to multiple antibiotic agents and he eventually
was started on a 30 day course of imipenem which started
approximately [**2111-4-14**].  Cultures also grew Methicillin
sensitive Staphylococcus aureus from his sputum no acute
distress he received an approximately 14 day course of gram
positive coverage consisting of vancomycin and oxacillin.
The patient was weaning well from the vent, however on
[**2111-4-10**], he was noted to have an acute desaturation.  Chest
x-ray was unremarkable and CT angiogram of the chest was
performed that showed bilateral pulmonary emboli.  On [**4-11**],
an IVC filter was placed.  However, it was noted that the
patient had anomalous venous architecture and on [**4-14**] the
second IVC filter was placed in the lower IVC.  A repeat CT
angiogram at this time also revealed no further extension of
the clot.  Given his slight respiratory compromise from the
clot, anticoagulation was readdressed to the neurosurgery
team and after a follow up negative head CT, the patient was
started on heparin drip and subsequently is being
coumadinized.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was initially kept NPO
without tube feeds.  Post pyloric feeding tube was placed
under fluoroscopic guidance in the Intensive Care Unit.  He
received regular tube feedings through this without
difficulty.  The day prior to PEG placement, the tube feed
was inadvertently moved on transfer.  The patient's PEG was
placed on [**2111-4-6**] and the patient tolerated feedings through
that well thereafter.  Of note, the patient had a 10 point
hematocrit drop on [**2111-4-7**].  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
revealed a 7 mm prepyloric ulcer that was cauterized.  He had
been maintained on appropriate antacid prophylaxis, however
after this event he was changed to Protonix and then Prevacid
[**Hospital1 **].  At the time of dictation, the patient is tolerating two
K per cc tube feeds.  This will be changed today to 1 K per
cc as the patient is no longer requiring fluid restriction.

5.  GENITOURINARY:  Foley was placed in the initial trauma
work up and has remained in place since.  The patient has
never had issues of inadequate urine output or electrolyte
abnormalities.  He is currently Hep-Locked.

6.  HEME:  The patient's hematocrit drifted down throughout
his stay and had the acute drop related to his upper
gastrointestinal bleed.  He required several units of
transfusion at that time, but since his hematocrit has been
stable to slowly increasing.  Anticoagulation for his
pulmonary embolus initially consisted of heparin drip with a
goal PTT of 50 to 70 followed by commencement of
coumadinization.  At this point, the patient's INR is only
1.5, so he is being discharged on a heparin drip until his
INR is between 2 and 3.  Please see the nursing notes as to
the doses the patient has received of Coumadin to this point.

7.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  As noted above, the patient's main
infectious complication has been pneumonia.  He has had
right middle lobe and right lower lobe infiltrates.  Cultures
have shown Enterobacter and Methicillin sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus and he is receiving a 30 day course of
imipenem which should complete around [**5-14**] to [**5-16**].
He also has been treated for Methicillin sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and has completed his course
of vancomycin and oxacillin.  Of note, the only positive
blood cultures were coagulase negative Staphylococcus aureus
from an A-line which had be
