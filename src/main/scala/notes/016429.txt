Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
COPD exacerbation


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13621**] is a 66-year-old smoker with a history of severe
emphysematous COPD (not on home O2, current smoker), recent
DVT/PE ([**1-1**]) now off coumadin, AAA, HTN, and multiple
admissions for pneumonia who presented with dyspnea and is
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of likely COPD
exacerbation requiring BiPAP.
.
He has been hospitalized multiple times for COPD exacerbation
and pneumonia requiring ICU admission and intubation on a single
occasion in [**2131-9-23**], and most recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] was
9/[**2131**]. He was in his usual state of health, (at baseline is
unable to walk a few steps without getting short of breath),
when he developed worsening of his chronic, productive cough and
shortness of breath yesterday. His symptoms progressed and were
unresponsive to bronchodilators and today he activated his
lifeline. Per report, he was 90% on 6L during nebs when seen by
EMS. He received 2 combivent and 3 albuterol nebs in the field,
and was transferred to the ED.
.
On arrival to the ED, initial VS were 97.4, 116, 198/89, 26, 97%
15L NRB. Patient was noted to be tripoding and using accessory
resp muscles. CXR was without focal consolidation, effusions, or
PTX. EKG revealed sinus tachycardia 118, p-pulmonale, STds in
leads V3-V5. Labs were notable for lactate 3.4, hypoNa (131),
trop 0.02 (CK/MB flat) and D-dimer 4317. CTA was ordered, but
not obtained [**12-24**] pain and increased respiratory rate.
.
He was given 2L of NS, 2 mg Magnesium, 125 of Solumedrol, and
500 of Azithromycin. VS prior to transfer were HR 113, BP
171/101, Rate 20, 100% on bipap peep 5, PS 10.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is on a non-rebreather. He
appears comfortable and reports that his breathing is improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
66-year-old M smoker with a history of severe COPD, prior PE/DVT
now off coumadin, AAA, and multiple admissions for pneumonia who
presents with dyspnea, cough and is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
management of likely COPD exacerbation requiring BiPAP.
.
# Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely [**12-24**] COPD given Hx of severe COPD (last
FEV1/FVC ratio 22), continued smoking, and presenting symptoms.
Acute SOB could be [**12-24**] reactive process [**12-24**] tobacco cessation in
2 days prior to admission. Recent diarrheal illness, could point
to viral bronchitis as trigger for sudden worsening. Pt is
alcoholic and also could have aspirated although lower
likelihood given lack of chest x-ray findings, lack of
temperature, and without leukocytosis or focal consolidation on
CXR to support PNA. BNP was elevated at 568, but he demonstrated
no exam findings of volume overload. D-dimer elevated at 4317
but CTA not obtained due to low concern for PE. LE dopplers
showed L superficial femoral partially occlusive clot that was
stable from ultra-sound in [**Month (only) **]. Troponin was 0.02 -> 0.03
with flat CKMB and no EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
Dyspnea and oxygenation improved on BiPAP and then patient
transitioned to nasal cannula with sats in high 90s. Pt was
initially given IV Solumedrol and Azithromycin in ED and then
transitioned to a prednisone taper starting at 40mg daily along
with 5 day Azithromycin course. He was restarted on home advair
200/50, standing nebs, and mucinex.
.
# Goals of Care: Pt with great difficulty in quality of life due
to COPD and likely to have recurrent episodes of similar
presentation due to COPD. Idea of hospice for COPD was breached
with patient during hospitalization. He was unsure how he felt
about this at time of discharge. Discussions of [**Hospital 2182**] hospice
should be continued in outpatient setting.
.
# Hx of DVT/PEs: Diagnosed with right segmental PE and LLE DVT
in [**12/2131**], coumadin stopped in [**2132-5-22**] in setting of concerns
related to medication adherence. ED sent D-dimer which was
elevated at 4317. CTA unable to be obtained in ED [**12-24**]
respiratory rate and back pain along with low concern for PE in
light of rapid improvement with Tx for COPD. LENIs on [**2133-2-23**] for
DVT eval showed partially occlusive thrombus in the left
superficial femoral vein which had also been noted on lower
extremity U/S in [**2132-7-23**].
.
# Hyponatremia: On admission, sodium level was 131. Given
evidence of hemoconcentration (Hct 48.6) and elevated lactate,
likely hypovolemic hyponatremia. Received 2L NS in ED. Even
after 2L NS FeNa was <1% consistent with pre-renal state as
well. With volume replenishment, sodium came up to 137 by day of
discharge.
.
# Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely [**12-24**] elevated lactate. No
evidence for uremia. Blood glucose not elevated. Received 2L of
NS in ED on admission and lactate elevation resolved with this.
.
# Osteoporosis: Hx of L1 fracture. On narcotics for chronic pain
with narcotics contract through outpatient PCP.
