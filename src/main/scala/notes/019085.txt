History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 yo male with pmhx significant for morbid obesity,
OSA, MG who was recently discharged ([**2151-7-27**]) after being
admitted from OSH with ddx of bilateral cellulitis, CCU stay c/b
VT and non STEMI, s/p post tracheostomy [**6-11**].
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] he course could be resumed as follows: His cellulitis
was treated with vancomycin on arrival, and he received 14 day
antibiotic course. He did not have fevers during his hospital
stay.
His hypoxia was thought to be multifactorial and it was very
difficult to weane from the vent. his NIF's were lowed, he also
had a a RLL infiltrate that he was treated with levauine. He
also underwent a bronchoscopy that did not reveal any gross
abnormalities and BAL grew 3+ GNR speciated as stenotrophomonas.
Based on daily assessment he tolerated up to 8 hours of 50%
trach mask although he needed intermittent CPAP 8/5 support.
Regarding his CV issues, he was transferred from OSH after
NSTEMI. he dad an episode of supraventricular tachicardia and
EKG showed lateral st depression. CArdiac enzymes were elevated.
His was treated with medical management heparin, BB, aspirin
plavis and statin. Regaridng his MG, he was continued on
mestinon and neoral.
.
Today, patient is brought from [**Hospital3 **] after an episode
of chest pain. Per referral notes, at 2:15 am patient was
complaining of of SOB and chest pain. VS HR 53, BP 154/80, R 22
Sat 98%. For his chest pain, he was given 0.4 mg sl x 3 with
complete relieve. At 2:55am, patient still refering difficulty
breathing and it was decided to transfer him for further
evaluation.. They also reported some bleeding around the [**Last Name (un) 21655**]
catheter.
.
In the ED: VS T 99.7, Hr 59, Bp 136/62, RR 20 Sats 100. By the
time he arrived, he was chest pain free. He was given ativan 2
mg x 1, ASA, 325mg Pox1. They placed a 3 way foley and started
NS bladder irrigation. he was also given dilaudid 0.5mg x1.
.
At this problem, patient does not remember well the episode of
chest pain, he actually describes more an indigestion feeling
early this morning. Denies any chest pressure, SOB, fevers or
cough at this point.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 M with pmhx significant for morbid obesity, HTN, DM OSA,
trach'd recently d/c from [**Hospital1 18**] with course c/b new NSTEMI and
difficulties weaning off the vent who presents with an episode
of chest pain.
.
# Chest pain: Patient was admitted for a chest pain but on
admission patient could not remember the episode of chest pain
and thought that it may have been indigestion. A CTA was
perfomred to r/o PE which was negative. Cardiac enzymes were
sent which revealed flat CKs and MBs with elevated troponins to
a max of 0.13 which then trended down. EKG was unchanged and he
had no further episodes of chest pain. Patient had known CAD and
is being medically managed for 2 recent NTSEMI's. It is likely
that he has unstable angina, but cannot undergo cardiac
catheterization. This may have been an episode of angina versus
GERD. He was continued on aspirin, lipitor, metoprolol, plavix
and lisinopril. If he has another episode of chest pain,
sublingual nitro should be attempted first and if pain resolves
this is likely angina. GIven that there would be no change in
management would avoid hospitalization unless there are other
indicators of significant cardiac ischemia such as EKG changes
or hemodynamic instability.
.
# Respiratroy failure: This is likely multifactorial including
OSA, MG. Prior to [**Hospital1 **] he was tolerating about 8 hours on
trach mask.  However, on admission he was having 1 minute
episodes of apnea when put on pressure support. Given that he
was alkalotic on ABG, it was felt that he was being
overventilated and therefore not breathing on his own. He was
slowly weaned and was tolerating pressure support [**12-5**] at
[**Month/Year (2) **]. He was also started on standing PO ativan which seems
to help with anxiety which on PS.

# Low grade temperature: Patient developed a temperature to
100.3 which subsequently resolved without antibiotics. Bllod
cultures had no growth to date as [**Month/Year (2) **], C. Diff was
negative, urine culature neagtive and sputum showed gram
negative rods which were not yet sepciated at [**Month/Year (2) **].
However, he had gram negative rods in his sputum on he previous
admission. This is felt likely to be colonization with
STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPHILIA given his temperature
rapidly reslved he did not have increased secretions and no
pneumonia on CXR.

# Hematuria: Patient had bleeding around his foley as well as
hematuria. A three way catherter was placed and the hematuris
reslved. The three way catherter was changed back to a regular
foley catherter at [**Month/Year (2) **].
.
# Renal: [**2151-8-3**] decrease on urine output that has responded to
fluid boluses. Creatinine stable.
Monitor and continue fluid boluses as needed.

# Anemia: Patient's HCT was 25-27 this hospitalization compared
to 27-30 on his previous admssion. He did have some hematuria on
admission which may have contributed to this small drop on HCT.
The hematuris resolved and his HCT remained stable.

#CV:
CAD: s/p NSTEMI - continue medical management plavix, aspirin,
BB and statin.
.
Pump: History of RHF, echo with elevated PA. He was euvolemic
and contiued on ACE-I.
.
Rhythm: Sinus bradycardia on BB.
.
#HTN. Well controlled on betablocker and ace inhibitor.
.
# h/o tibial cellulitis: s/p 14 days of vanc some venous stasis
component mainly remains ptherwise no evidence of infection
.
# DM: Fingersticks well controlled on RISS.
.
# Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: stable cont on mestinon, neoral-
cyclosporin.
.
# Anxiety: He was continued on zoloft, ativan PO standing and IV
prn.
.
# FEN:  Patient passed s
