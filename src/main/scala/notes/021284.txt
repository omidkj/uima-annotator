Chief Complaint:
Etoh Withdrawal and SDH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
68M who stated that he was in USOH until this afternoon. He was
at home and had approximately 40 oz of beer. He was outside of
his home, slipped (unclear if he tripped or just slipped- he
notes that he walks with a cane at baseline and does have a
history of gait unsteadiness), and fell striking the back of his
head. He lost consciousness for an undetermined amount of time.

The next thing he remembers is waking up at an OSH. There he was

found to have SAH/SDH on head CT. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED

for further evaluation.
.
In the emergency department, initial vitals: 98.3, 97, 164/80,
20, 97%RA. Head CT with nondisplaced skull fracture, several
subdural and intraventricular bleed. He received valium 5 mg IV
X 2 for CIWA>10, morphine 4 mg IV X1, tylenol 650 PO X 1, and 1L
NS. He was seen by neurosurgery who felt that there was no acute
indication for intervention at this time. He was transferred to
MICU for closer monitoring of neuro status and withdrawal
.
Upon arrival to the floor, he reports worsening headache, neck
ache, and lower back pain. He denies any chest pain,
palpitations, N/V, abd pain, diarrhea, melena, BRBPR. He denies
ever having seizures from EtOH withdrawal. His last drink was
noon today and drinks 60 ounces daily.

CT Head: [**2128-5-7**]
FINDINGS: Multiple areas of predominantly subdural hemorrhage
are noted
bilaterally. There are small bilateral prefrontal subdural
hematomas and a
potential left frontal small subarachnoid hemorrhage. There are
additional
left pretemporal and small bilateral inferior frontal subdural
hematomas.
Subdural blood layers along the tentorium and frontal portion of
falx cerebri. Small amount of layering blood is noted in the
occipital horns of both lateral ventricles. There is no mass
effect or shift of normally midline structures. Cavum septum
pellucidum is noted. There is bilateral periventricular white
matter hypoattenuation consistent
with chronic small vessel ischemic change. There is a
nondisplaced left
frontal skull fracture. There are no other fractures. The soft
tissues are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral subdural hematomas, with minimal intraventricular
and
subarachnoid hemorrhage. No mass effect or shift of normally
midline
structure.
2. Nondisplaced left frontal skull fracture.
.
EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Findings are within normal limits. No previous
tracing available for comparison.
.
CT Head w/o contrast [**2128-5-11**]:
FINDINGS: Again seen is a left middle cranial fossa subdural
hemorrhage,
adjacent to the left temporal lobe tip, and appears to be quite
similar in
extent compared to prior study. There is a subarachnoid
component in the
region of gyrus rectus on both sides as seen before and there is
a frontal
subdural collection in this location, with similar appearance
compared to
prior study. There is some hyperdensity in the area above
suprasellar
cistern, which could be an artifact, or redistribution of
previously seen left temporal lobe hemorrhage (2:13). The blood
previously seen in the right tentorium is less conspicuous on
the current scan. The blood in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is not
visualized on the current scan. There has been no change in
ventricular size. There is no shift of normally placed midline
structures.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the extensive subdural
hemorrhage,
particularly in the left subfrontal region.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was initially admitted to the MICU and was observed
overnight for signs of ETOH withdrawl. He was also seen by
Neurosugery, that felt that there was no need for immediate
surgical intervention. The pt was then transfered from from MICU
following admission for SDH, [**2-9**] to fall, and EtoH withdrawl
monitoring on CIWA. The pt states he remembers falling, however
the next thing he knew he was in hospital. At an OSH the pt was
noted to have SAH/SDH on head CT and subsequently transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals: 98.3, 97, 164/80, 20, 97%RA. Head CT
with nondisplaced skull fracture, several subdural and
intraventricular bleed. The pt was subsequently transfered to
the MICU for closer monitoring of neuro status and withdrawal.
While in the MICU he received valium 5 mg IV X 7 over 36s hrs
for CIWA>10, morphine 4 mg IV X1, tylenol 650 PO X 1, and 1L NS.
The pt was seen neurosurgery who felt that there was no acute
indication for intervention.

Upon arrival to the floor, he reports headache, nec
