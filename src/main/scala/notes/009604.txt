History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 55 year old female with PMH significant for type 1
diabetes mellitus, HTN, CAD s/p NSTEMI two weeks prior to
admission, CRI who presented with nausea, vomiting, and chest
pain. In significant PMH, pt was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2140-10-8**] and found to have a NSTEMI. Coronary cath during that
admission revealed 3 vessel CAD. At that time, she opted for
medical management instead of surgical intervention. Pt reported
that she was in her normal state of health following discharge
until 7:00 PM on the night of admission. At that time, she
developed nausea and epigastric pain. Patient took two SL NTG
with relief of her pain and went to sleep at that time. However,
she awoke with severe nausea and dry heaves. Pt vomited a small
amount of mucous like material. She also felt feverish and had
chills although she did not measure her temperature. On
admission, pt also reported increased LE edema. In the [**Name (NI) **], pt
received levofloxacin and vancomycin. She was admitted to
medicine for further care.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 y/o female with extensive PMH including type 1 DM and CAD
with recent NSTEMI who was admitted with nausea, vomiting and
chest pain.

1. Cholecystitis- Although her abdominal exam was benign on
admission, her LFTs were elevated on admission and her
ultrasound showed a thickened gallbladder wall with
pericholecystic fluid and multiple gallbladder stones. There was
also enlargement of the tail of the pancreas. Surgery was
consulted and was very concerned that the pt possibly had acute
cholecystitis. Pt was transferred to the SICU for closer
monitoring at that time. A HIDA scan was obtained which was
negative for tracer in the biliary tree. Surgery was not
considered a good immediate option given the pt's recent MI if
she remained stable. Therefore, she was continued on antibiotics
with close monitoring. A MRCP was obtained on [**2140-10-18**] which
showed a a thickened edematous gallbladder wall with stones in
the gallbladder and cystic duct. No bile duct dilitation. A
4x3x3 cm mass was visualized in the pancreas.  The patient was
initally treated with ampicillin, levofloxacin and flagyl. This
was subsequently changed to augmentin. She will complete a 2
week course following discharge and will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient for elective cholecystectomy. Of note,
a follow up ultrasound was done 1 week into her admission and
showed marked improvement in the gallbladder appearance with no
pericholecystic fluid and decreased wall edema, gallbladder
distention.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure- The patient's baseline
creatinine of approximately 4.5 increased to 6.0 and she had
decreased urine output. Urine sediment was consistent with ATN.
She developed a worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis with
decreasing bicarb most consistent with worsening renal failure.
Renal was consulted and a dialysis line was placed on [**10-22**] and
hemodialysis was started. She was also started on nephrocaps and
renagel.  At the time of discharge she is producing some urine;
however, she will likely require longterm dialysis.  She will
initiate outpatient dialysis at [**Location (un) 4265**] [**Location (un) **] on [**2140-11-1**].

3. CHF- During her SICU course patient had a CHF exacerbation
and manifested pulmonary rales and a cardiac friction rub. Her
CXR was consistent with failure. She was treated with gentle
diuresis and fluid removal with hemodialysis. She was continued
on hydralazine and beta blocker.

4. [**Name (NI) **] Pt is s/p NSTEMI two weeks prior to this admission. It
was decided that this would be medically managed per the
patient's request. Her beta blocker was titrated up and she was
continued on hydralazine, nitrates, aspirin, and lipitor. Of
note, the patient did have 2 discrete troponin leaks during this
admission.

5. HTN- Continued on her antihypertensive regimen including
hydralazine, nitrate, and beta blocker.  Hydralazine and
[**Name (NI) 97116**] were titrated up.

6. History of seizure- The patient was continued on
phenobarbital and the dose was increased to adjust for clearance
during hemodialysis.

7. Anemia- Hct was above baseline. She was continued on epogen
which is now being given at dialysis.

8. Type 1 DM- The patient was continued on her regimen of NPH
and RISS.  However, while the patient was NPO her NPH was held
and she subsequently had a worsening metabolic acidosis on [**10-24**]
and was found to have + serum ketones. She was then transfered
to the MICU for DKA management. Her insulin gtt was discontinued
on [**10-25**] and she was successfully transitioned back to NPH and
RISS. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted.

9. FEN- [**Doctor First Name **] diet.

10. Proph- PPI, SC heparin; bowel regimen
