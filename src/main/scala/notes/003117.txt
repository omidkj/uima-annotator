HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 60-year-old female with
a history of type 2 diabetes, bipolar disorder, multiple
psychiatric admissions, asthma, hypertension, who was found down
at her nursing home at 8 p.m. on the day prior to admission.

Per the nursing home staff she had a fingerstick of 289 earlier
that evening, and the patient was given permission to administer
herself one unit of Humalog insulin.  Per the patient, the [**Doctor Last Name **]
House staff watched her draw the one unit and administer this.
She has only given herself insulin injections twice before.

She remembers falling asleep, but per the staff she was noted
to have three to four generalized tonic-clonic seizures and
reportedly had a fingerstick of 10.  She was given thiamine,
glucose, 8 mg of Ativan with decreased seizure activity, per
reports.  She was subsequently intubated for airway
protection with declining mental status and concern that the
patient had aspirated, large food particles were then
suctioned from her airway.  Patient was treated with
Clindamycin for two days in the Medical Intensive Care Unit,
has remained afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and was
extubated the day prior to being transferred to the floor.

The Neurology service consulted on her in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and recommended checking an MRI and an
EEG to rule out any structural seizure focus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.5, heart rate 59 to
85, blood pressure 80 to 124/32 to 82, respirations 18,
oxygen saturation 94 to 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula,
fingerstick about 300.  Generally, she is in no acute
distress, alert and oriented times three.  HEENT:  Mucous
membranes are moist with no jugular venous distention, no
lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm;
no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Pulmonary is clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended; normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are
without edema with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Neurological:  Cranial nerves II-XII are intact, moving all
extremities well.  Sensation grossly intact with bilateral
deep tendon reflexes [**12-27**].
