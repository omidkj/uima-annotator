Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Epigastric Pain, Diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
61M w/ CAD, DM2, HTN, presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] [**6-16**] with
epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  This AM, he
ate bacon and eggs at a restaurant.  Two hours later, he had
profuse diarrhea, nausea, dry heaving.  He noted his stools were
dark brown but denies black tarry stools or BRBPR.  He has also
had a cough x 3 days, nonproductive.  Denies fever/chills.  No
sore throat, travel, sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] came to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
this afternoon.  His BP was noted to be 76/56 with HR 94.  He
was given 3L NS, Zofran, Reglan, and was started on dopamine.
He was sent for CT to r/o mesenteric ischemia.  In the CT
scanner, he developed chest pain.  Repeat ECG showed inferior ST
elevations.  He was started on heparin, and was given morphine,
Plavix 600mg po, and Zofran, and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for cath.
.
In the cath, he had patent LAD and LCX stents, and unchanged
chronic total occlusion of RCA.  He was given 400cc NS and
weaned off dopamine.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service.  On
arrival to the floor, a trigger was called for BP 70/40 with HR
118.  He was given 1L NS bolus with no response.  He was started
on dopamine.  He was taken for a CT to r/o RP bleed, which was
negative.  He was transferred to the CCU.
.
On arrival to the CCU, he complained of mild chest pressure.
His dopamine was switched to levophed, and his chest pain
resolved.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.

In the CCU, he was aggressively volume repleted with a total of
18L, on 2 L O2. He was subsequently given lasix 20 IV and
diuresed well. Insulin gtt switched to Lantus; was on metformin
when he was admitted. Being tx for sepsis of unknown source with
Cipro/Flagyl, no further fevers. Ct abdomen and U/S negative,
c.diff negative, covering for UTI/GI coverage. BP 150s,
restarted bp meds, LFTs elevated, increased statin, ACE holding.
b/l Cr 1.1, currently 1.5, cardiac enzymes trop and CK elevated
from demand ischemia.

Gen: obese man lying flat in bed, NAD, resp or otherwise.
Oriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate. Pleasant.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctivae pink, no pallor or
cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple. Unable to assess JVP due to large diameter of
neck.

Pertinent Results:
RUQ Ultrasound:IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without evidence for
acute cholecystitis.

CT ABDOMEN:
IMPRESSION:
1. Trace amount of free fluid in the pelvis, measuring
approximately 1.1 x 1.9 x 2.6 cm, likely a sequela of recent
procedure, but not large enough to explain hypotension. No
retroperitoneal or groin hematoma.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
3. Gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis.
4. Somewhat atrophic left kidney.
5. Extensive degenerative disease of the lumbar and lower
thoracic spine.

C. CATH
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed:

--the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the LAD had mild luminal irregularities, with widely patent
stent
--the LCX had mild luminal irregularities, with widely patent
stent
--the RCA had a chronic distal occlusion unchanged from prior.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
systolic pressures, with SBP 109 mmHg.
3.  Successful closure of right femoral arteriotomy site with
6-French
Angioseal device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  One-vessel coronary artery disease with occluded RCA
unchanged from
[**2154-1-15**]
2.  Demand collateral insufficiency in setting of hypotension
and
tachycardia

Brief Hospital Course:
61M w/ CAD s/p IMI, DM2, with epigastric pain, hypotension,
fever, concerning for sepsis. Initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU
for cardiac cath in setting of developing chest pain in the CT
scanner at OSH.
.

# CAD:  Pt had ST elevation at OSH while on dopamine and was
transferred here for cardiac catheterization.  The Cath report
showed widely patent LAD and LCX stents, chronic distal
occlusion of RCA unchanged from prior. It was felt his ST
elevations were most likely secondary to collateral
insufficiency in setting of hypotension, tachycardia, and
dopamine.  Repeat EKG's unchanged from baseline once off the
dopamine. Continued ASA, Statin, metoprolol was titrated up and
sent home on 75mg PO TID. Lisinopril was restarted and increased
to 20mg at time of discharge.
.

# Hypotension

The patient presented with hypotension and had been on dopamine
while undergoing a cardiac catheterization.  However, post
procedure, the pt remained persistently hypotensive and was thus
transferred to the CCU for ongoing care.  Initially there was
concern that his hypotension may be secondary to an RP bleed and
a CT Abdomen was done which showed no pathology or RP bleed.  He
was suspected to have sepsis as the cause given his subsequently
noted leukocytosis (WBC 28), anion gap acidosis, low-grade fever
100.  He was bolused with ongoing IVF and placed on Levophed. It
was felt that the most likely source was intraabdominal given
localizing symptoms on presentation including nausea and
diarrhea. There was also a  possibility of cholecystitis given
known gallstones, however RUQ ultrasound did not show evidence
of this. A CXR without evidence of infiltrate. U/A mildly
positive. Cortisol WNL. He was initially covered with broad
spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, Zosyn and Flagyl for
possible GI source.  He was resuscitated with 20 Liters of IVF
and weaned of Levophed.  It was felt that ultimately his
hypotension was multifactorial including acute gastroenteritis
on top of what was likely chronic diarrhea with dehydration and
some DKA/osmotic diuresis from poorly controlled sugars.  Given
he remained afebrile and WBC improved to 6.0,  his antibiotics
were change to Ciprofloxacin to complete a 7 day course for a
presumed UTI.
.

# Pump:  Pt had ECHO showing EF 55% with symmetric LVH. After
fluid resuscitation pt with some increased SOB and mild volume
overload.  He was subsequently diuresed with IV Lasix given he
was 18 liters positive when transferred out of CCU. He diuresed
extremely well and was discharged on
