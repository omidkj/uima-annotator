Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 85785**] is a very nice 36 year-old gentleman with
history of smoking and hemoptysis who was recently diagnosed
with a mediastinal mass who presented with hemoptysis. He had
been well in his prior state of health until ~3 months ago when
he started with cough and feeling upper back and left shoulder
pain that occasionally went down his left arm and to his
fingers. It was dull. He also reported feeling dizzy on occasion
but did not relate that to any position or certain movement. He
had been having dry cough since then but over the past 2 weeks
started noting occasional blood streaked sputum once or twice in
the am and later would not have any more hemoptysis. He
presented to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital where he was admitted on
[**3-22**] and discharged on [**3-25**] and during that period he had a CT
guided biopsy of the mass with the results inconclusive but
showing malignant cells suggestive of carcinoma vs germ cell
tumor.
.
The afternoon prior to admission, he started noting more blood
in his phlegm which he quantified as a quarter of a dime when he
cough blood.  He estimates a total of around 15 ml from all
episodes of hemoptysis over the previous day, with the amount
each time and frequency stable.  He denied having had any
further episodes of hemoptysis since presenting to the ED. He
also had noted 2 days prior a transient sharp pain in his left
mid chest that he can point to with 3 fingers.
.
In our ER his initial VS were T 99.3 F, HR 123 BPM, BP 132/83
mmHg, RR 20 X', SpO2 98% on RA. He had slightly decreased breath
sounds in the lower left of his chest. There was no wheezing.
His ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 120 BPM without any signs of
ischemia. His labs were significant for a microcytic
normochromic anemia with HCT of 36. Coags were normal. He
underwent a CT-PE, which showed a small PE in left upper lobe
segmental artery. The mass in the upper mediastinum was
visualized measuring 14x5 cm aprox and was compressing the
pulmonary artery. His CT scan of his head showed no acute
intracranial process. IP was consulted in regards to management
of PE in a patient with a mediastinal mass and they recommended
gentle anticoagulation with heparin gtt and possible rigid
bronchoscopy with biopsy after admission.

Social History:
He lives in [**Location 1439**], MA. He has been smoking 1 PPD for 22 years

alcohol occasionally. He works at [**Company **]. He lives with his
uncle and aunt.

Family History:
His maternal uncle had lung cancer and was a smoker, his
paternal grandmother had lung cancer and was not a smoker, his
paternal aunt had breast cancer.

Imaging:
Chest CTA
IMPRESSION:
1. Small filling defect within the left upper lobe segmental
pulmonary
artery, concerning for pulmonary embolus.
2. Extensive large left paramediastinal mass lesion which
markedly attenuates and encases the left main pulmonary artery.
Moderate left pleural effusion with paraseptal emphysematous
changes. Left lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Focal patchy opacity in the left lingula may represent a
superimposed
infectious process vs. tumor involvement.
4. Prominent left retrocrural lymph node.
5. Lucency within the sternum with a sclerotic border. Given the
patient's
history of lung cancer, bone scan may be performed for further
evaluation or correlation with PET-CT.

CT Head w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Mild sinus disease.

MRI Head: IMPRESSION: No evidence of metastatic disease to the
head.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Retrocrural and celiac lymphadenopathy, no other evidence of
disease in the abdomen and pelvis.
2. Partially imaged large left pleural effusion

FNA, Left Mediastinal:
Left mediastinal:
Poorly differentiated carcinoma, see note.
Note: Tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin cocktail,
cytokeratin 7, TTF-1, and p63.  Tumor cells are negative for
cytokeratin 20, AFP, PLAP, and CD30.  Overall, the morphologic
and immunohistochemical findings are suggestive of a poorly
differentiated primary lung carcinoma, possibly with squamous
differentiation.

Mediastinal Mass Biopsy: (from [**Location (un) **], sent for review)
Malignant poorly differentiated epithelioid neoplasm; see note.
Note: The biopsy is comprised of tiny fragments of fibrous
tissue being infiltrated by malignant epithelioid cells.
Submitted immunostains show that the neoplastic cells are
positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, focally cytokeratin 7, EMA,
and focally TTF-1.  In addition, by report, immunostains
performed at [**Hospital6 1708**] showed that the
neoplastic cells are also positive for p63 and SALL4.  The
neoplastic cells are negative for cytokeratin 20, LCA,
monoclonal CEA, HCG, PLAP, and S-100.  A mucicarmine stain does
not demonstrate mucin.

Overall, the morphologic and immunohistochemical findings are
most suggestive of a poorly differentiated carcinoma, possibly
of lung origin, given the TTF-1 expression.  However, the
significance of the reported p63 and SALL4 positivity is
unclear, and a thymic carcinoma or germ cell neoplasm cannot be
entirely excluded.  Therefore, in this very limited sample,
definitive classification is not possible.

C Spine/Left Shoulder X-ray:
In the cervical spine, two views demonstrate cervical spine
through the
cervicothoracic junction. Cervical vertebral body height and
alignment are
maintained. There is loss of disc height at C3-4 with endplate
sclerosis and anterior and posterior osteophytes. There are mild
degenerative changes at the remainder of the levels. There is
prevertebral soft tissue swelling.  Facet joints are aligned.
There is mild uncovertebral narrowing at all levels.
In the left shoulder, three views demonstrate normal
acromiocl
