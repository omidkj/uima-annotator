Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 to LAD.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4223**] is a 64yo gentleman with h/o 2 vessel CAD s/p DES
to LAD in [**3-/2185**], ESRD on HD, and DM who presented to [**Hospital1 3325**] after he awoke with acute shortness of breath.  As
patient is intubated and no family present, history per chart
review.
.
Patient had 4 day history of stuttering chest pain for which he
did not seek medical care.  On the day of presentation, he awoke
in the middle of the night with chest pain and shortness of
breath.  He presented to [**Hospital3 **], where he was intubated
for airway protection in the setting of tachypnea and agitation.
 Of note, his last HD was Saturday (2 days ago).  He was noted
to have increased ST elevations in V1-V3 with trop I of 2 and
normal CK.  He was not given [**Hospital3 **] or [**Hospital3 4532**].  He was started on
heparin, integrillin, and nitro gtt and given lasix 40mg IV,
lopressor 5mg IV, and levofloxacin prior to transfer.
.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], his initial VS were:  100.6   171/115   106
 21   97% on vent.   He was given [**Hospital1 **] 600mg PR and
versed/propofol for improved sedation.  He was sent to the cath
lab because of concern for STE as noted above.
.
In the cath lab, he was found to have 3 vessel disease with 50%
distal left main disease, LAD with 90% long proximal instent
restenosis and 80% D1.  The LCx had 80% proximal stenosis; OM1
and ramus were noted to be patent.  The RCA had 60%
proximal/ostial lesion with dampening.  Left ventriculography
showed MR, EF not recorded in prelim report.  Team was
undertaking POBA as bridge to CABG when he dissected his LAD; 2
cypher stents were placed with good result.  Integrillin was
stopped during the procedure given his ESRD on dialysis.  CT
surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] to evaluate for possible CABG given his
anatomy and multiple comorbidities.  Total contrast was 135ml.
Hemodynamics from right heart cath demonstrated elevated RA (12)
and PCW (19) pressures.
.
Unable to complete ROS as patient is intubated.
.
Cardiac review of systems not done at this time.

Echo [**2185-6-27**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with extensive regional dysfunction including near
akinesis of the septum and anterior walls, distal inferior and
lateral walls, and apex There is an apical left ventricular
aneurysm. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded
(clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free
wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be estimated.There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
ECG [**2185-6-27**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Old anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Right
bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular block.
.
Cardiac cath [**2185-6-27**]:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. In-stent restenosis of proximal LAD stent.
3. Elevated biventricular filling pressures.
4. Successful angioplasty and stenting of the proximal LAD using
two
overlaping 2.5x28 and 2.5x8 mm Cypher (DES) stents.
5. Continue [**Month/Day/Year **]


Brief Hospital Course:
64yo gentleman with h/o CAD, DM, and ESRD being evaluated for
transplant admitted with chest pain, ST elevations, and
respiratory distress requiring intubation, found to have 3
vessel disease on cath, s/p LAD dissection and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 to LAD.
The patient ruled in with troponins.
.
# CAD/Ischemia:
Noted to have 3 vessel disease on cath. Attempt was made at
balloon angioplasty of LAD, with plan to then go to CABG;
however, this was complicated by dissection of his LAD.  Two DES
were placed in the LAD after dissection in the cath lab, and
patient was started on [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4532**], beta blocker, statin, imdur.
 No ACE was started as the patient has a history of hyperkalemia
on these medications.  He was also started on anticoagulation
(heparin and coumadin) for an apical aneurysm on echo.  His INR
was 1.9 at discharge with a goal INR of 1.8-2.5.  As patient was
complaining of increased shortness of breath several days before
he presented to the hospital with markedly elevated troponins
(above that expected with ESRD) despite normal CKs as well as
EKGs with rate-related anterior ST elevations, he most likely
had a missed STEMI prior to admission.  As pt is on [**Last
