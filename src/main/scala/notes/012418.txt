Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11552**]
Chief Complaint:
RLE edema, erythema


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tunnelled Dialysis Catheter Placement


History of Present Illness:
61 yo F child psychiatrist w/ PMH significant for type 1 IDDM
(s/p revision renal and pancreas transplants, [**2160**] and [**2174**]),
diastolic CHF (Echo 35-40%, [**7-/2181**]), recurrent MDR E coli UTIs,
chronic anemia, currently on dialysis for repeated hyperkalemia,
and h/o recurrent fevers and infections presents with right
lower extremity swelling and redness x 3 days, associated with
temp to 99.4 w/ chills last night. These symptoms were present
at a hospital admission on [**11-5**] and resolved spontaneously
while the patient was on antibiotics (meropenem). She was
switched to ceftazidime with dialysis as an outpatient for gram
negative bacteremia.  The patient states that she was doing well
at rehab until the end of last week, when she experienced
increasing edema and erythema of her RLE.  Symptoms worsened
until 1 day PTA, when the patient experienced subjective fever
and chills.

In the ED, VSS.  The patient was found to have right LE w/ 1+
pitting edema, erythema, and warmth, no open wounds or lesions.
Lower extremity duplex showed non-occlusive thrombus in the R.
popliteal vein.  She was started on a heparin drip 1000u/hr,
without bolus.  The patient also received 1 dose of IV
vancomycin for presumed cellulitis.

On the floor, the patient currently feels well.  She believes
that erythema is improved from 2 days PTA.  No fevers/chills,
SOB, pleuritic chest pain, cough.  Patient does endorse several
weeks of diarrhea since starting ceftazidime.  She began a
course of loperimide in rehab that resulted in improvement in
the frequency of her diarrhea, although stools are still loose.

Reports:
CXR [**2181-11-24**]
1. Interval placement of a right internal jugular dialysis
catheter, which has its tip in the right atrium and is in
similar position to that on prior study dated [**2181-11-6**].
2. The previously seen left effusion has decreased in size.
There is a
diffuse bilateral interstitial process, which likely reflects a
component of mild pulmonary edema. The heart remains borderline
enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
No focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.

CXR [**2181-11-25**]
1. Right internal jugular dialysis catheter again having its tip
within the right atrium in similar position as
