History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 108231**] is a 65 year-old woman with CAD s/p CABG [**2164-4-18**]
with post-op course complicated by pnemothorax, afib and pleural
effusions with readmission for pneumonia/effusions s/p VATS and
s/p trach PEG for persistant respiratory failure. She was
dischared to LTAC on [**6-25**] and was being actively diuresed there
with 40mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **] and having received an additional 40mg IV
on [**6-30**] for dyspnea associated with e/o CHF on CXR. Today she
was noted to be in vtach and c/o chest pressure. She became
pulsless and received one synchronized shock at 300 J with
prompt return of sinus rhythm and spontaneous ciruculation. She
was transfered to the ED where initial vitals were HR 79 BP
110/33 RR 22 O2sat 100 on vent. In the ED, she was transiently
hypotensive and responsed ro 1L IVF. Given her hypotension,
cultures were drawn and broad spectrum antibiotics initiated. A
femoral line was placed (given elevated INR and trach). A
bedside ultrasound by the ED resident was notable for what
appeared to be global hypokinesis and a full IVC. She was
transferred to the ICU for further care. Vitals on transfer were
HR 80 and BP 83/33. Mag at [**Hospital 100**] rehab was 1.6. ECG showed a
paced rhythm at 80 with LVH and <[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V3-V6.
.
On arrival here she is alert and oriented. She reports minimal
chest pressure which is present chronically. She denies recent
fevers/chills or any other symptoms of note. She reports that
the only significant change was realtively aggressive diuresis
with IV lasix over the past day and transfusion of 1 unit pRBCs
for anemia with additional lasix. Her respiratory status is at
baseline.
.
Patient has had a complicated course recently which began in
[**4-/2164**] when she presented to the ED with anginal symptoms.
Work-up at that time revealed 3 vessel disease and 90% in-stent
stenosis of LCX. Underwent CABG on [**2164-4-18**] with LIMA to LAD,
SVG to RCA and SVG to OM. Pt transferred to CVICU post-procedure
with course complicated by a right-sided pleural effusion
requiring a thoracentesis and complete reexpansion of her right
lung, multiple pneumothoraces and subcutaneous emphysema
requiring reintubation, and intermittent episodes of rapid
atrial fibrillation alternating with periods of junctional
rhythm requiring pacemarker placement. Patient was discharged to
rehab and was readmitted on [**6-11**] with loculated left sided
pleural effusion requiring left thoracotomy and decortication
with hospital course complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure
thought secondary to pneumonia now s/p percutaneous tracheostomy
tube and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. She was
discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU on [**6-25**]. Her active problems
there included:
--hypokelmia
--loose stools on vanc po, cdiff pending
--anxiety on ativan prn
--supratherapeutic INR, coumadin held
--Anemia: ob + stool
--metabolic alkalosis
--delerium, improved on haldol
--respiratory failure with complicated pleural effusions, CXR
with bilateral fibrosis, effusions
--systolic CHF on aldactone, metoprolol, amio reduced and
lopressor increased on [**6-29**]
--candidiasis with catheter tip positive on fluconazole
--anasarca, albumin 1.8
