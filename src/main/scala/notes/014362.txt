Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
64 year old man with past medical history of diabetes mellitus
and hepatitis C was admitted from the ED with new findings of
neutropenia and shortness of breath.

Patient reports increasing fatigue and SOB x 2 weeks with
associated myalgias, night sweats, subjective fevers, and
shaking chills. His symptoms worsened over the last 24 hours and
he then came to the ED. Additional symptoms include the
following:
- shortness of breath with minimal activity
- hemoptysis with coughing up clots of blood on the day prior to
admission
- productive cough with green sputum
- abdominal pain which he believes is secondary to repetitive
coughing
- chronic low back pain unchanged in character from previous

He otherwise denies increased infections, chest pain, dysuria,
diarrhea, constipation, lower extremity swelling, recent
bleeding, or easy bruising. Of note, patient was recently found
to have segmental retinal vein occlusion, raising concern for a
hypercoagulable state.

Upon admission to the ED, temp 98.2, HR 109, BP 121/67, RR 18,
and pulse ox 96% RA. He received 3L NS, ibuprofen 600mg,
ketorolac 15mg x 2, levofloxacin 750mg IV x 1, percocet x 2, and
morphine 2mg IV x 1. Shortly after admission to the ED, patient
was apparently clinically stable; however over the course of the
day, patient became increasingly tachypneic and diaphoretic
resulting in MICU admission.

   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2142-8-15**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2142-8-17**]):
      SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
      MOLD.    1 COLONY ON 1 PLATE.
PA AND LATERAL CHEST [**2142-8-14**] AT 12:21 P.M.

HISTORY: Productive cough.

COMPARISON: [**2137-9-27**].

FINDINGS: There is a consolidation with air bronchograms in the
posterior and lateral basal segments of the left lower lobe
consistent with pneumonia. The costophrenic angle is obscured
which may be due to a small parapneumonic effusion. The
remainder of the lungs are clear. The mediastinum demonstrates a
mildly tortuous aorta. The cardiac silhouette is within normal
limits for size and stable. No definite pneumothorax is seen.
There is no right effusion. The visualized osseous structures
are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe pneumonia as detailed above.
Possible small associated parapneumonic effusion. Repeat
radiography following appropriate diuresis recommended to assess
for underlying infection.

BNP with continued moderate hypoxia, tachycardia and SOB
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for change in effusions, atypical PNA, PE, other
pulmonary causes of hypoxia, vascular engorgement?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CTA CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST

HISTORY: Worsening hypoxia and tachycardia, evaluate for PE or
other cause of hypoxia.

TECHNIQUE: Pre- and post-contrast helical acquisition obtained
through the chest. 100 cc of Optiray intravenously administered.

COMPARISON: No prior CT.

CHEST: There is no mediastinal mass or lymphadenopathy. There
are small bilateral effusions, right greater than left. There is
no pneumothorax. There is no CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Degenerative change of the spine is noted.

There is multifocal patchy airspace opacity involving the
perihilar area on the right, as well as bilateral lower lobes,
left greater than right. Findings are likely infectious, though
the presence of bibasilar opacities raises the possibility of
superimposed aspiration. The central airways are patent.

IMPRESSION: No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.

ECG	Study Date of [**2142-8-22**]  12:26:54 AM

Sinus tachycardia. Probable left ventricular hypertrophy with
repolarization
abnormalities. Compared to prior tracing of [**2142-8-19**] no
diagnostic interim
change.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo male with past medical history of metastatic prostate
cancer, type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hepatitis C
was admitted with shortness of breath and found to have
neutropenia.


# Shortness of breath - The patient was found to have a LLL
pneumonia.  Given his neutropenia on admission, he was started
on broad spectrum antibiotics (ceftaz/vanco/levo).  His
neutropenia resolved and the ceftaz w
