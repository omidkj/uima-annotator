History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 77 year old female with a history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary on home oxygen, known aortic stenosis,
atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, and coronary
artery disease. She has been followed closely by her
pulmonologist and cardiologist both of whom have noted a decline
in her functional status and increasing shortness of breath in
the setting of worsening aortic stenosis. She reports she is
unable to climb stairs. She can ambulate only short distances
with a rolling walker, classifying her as NYHA Class III heart
failure.  She reports lightheadness when lying down in bed at
night. She denies chest pain. She is noteably short of breath
with extended conversation. She is referred for aortic valve
treatment options.  She is enrolled in the Core Valve study and
randomized to surgery.  She is admitted pre-operatively for
Heparin bridge.

Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  >= 55%  >= 55%

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA. No
thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

AORTIC VALVE: Severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2).

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Written informed consent was obtained from the
patient. A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I
certify I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:

     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PREBYPASS: Normal systolic funciont with LVEF > 55%, with no
segmental wall motion abnormalities. Severe LVH. Severe aortic
stenosis with severely calcified stenotic valve. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion. No PFO is seen.
Normal coronary sinus. Normal Aorta.

POSTBYPASS: Normally functioning AV bioprosthesis. No
significant insufficiency or stenosis (mildly increased gradient
likely due to CO of 7.5-8 L/min). Normal LV sytolic function
with LVEF > 55%

Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH

TECHNIQUE: AP upright and lateral chest views were reviewed in
comparison to
prior radiograph from [**2190-11-30**].

FINDINGS:

Moderately enlarged heart size is smaller than it was on
[**2190-11-30**].
Both lung volumes have improved. Bilateral pleural effusions, if
any, are
minimal and unchanged. Bilateral lower lung atelectasis are
present but
significantly improved since [**2190-11-30**]. Mediastinal and
hilar
contours are normal. Patient is status post median sternotomy
with intact
sternal sutures. Mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic calcification
is present in
the aortic arch. Internal jugular line through left-sided
approach terminates
at lower SVC. No discrete lung opacities concerning for
pneumonia.

IMPRESSION: Since [**2190-11-30**], moderately enlarged heart,
mild
bilateral pleural effusions and lung aeration have improved

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for a heparin bridge for atrial
fibrillation.  On the following day she underwent an aortic
valve replacement with a tissue valve on [**11-23**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
 Please see the operative note for details.  She tolerated the
procedure well and was transfered in critical but stable
condition to the surgical intensive care unit.  She was
extubated by the following day, but then reintubated on the next
evening. She was further diuresed. Her chest tubes and
epicardial wires were removed.  Coumadin was started for chronic
atrial fibrillation.  She remained on neosynepherine for several
days.  She became febrile and was cultured and her lines were
resited.  She completed a course of fluconazole for yeast in
sputum, no other cultures became positive.  On post-operative
day five she was extubated to BIPAP successfully.  Over the next
couple of days she weaned from BIPAP.  She was seen by the
speech and swallow service secondary to prolonged intubation and
she was cleared for thin liquids and ground solids. By
post-operative day nine she was transferred to the surgical step
down floor.  She was seen in consultation by the physical
therapy service.  The patient received a PICC on [**12-3**]//11 for
ongoing IV diuresis and phlebotomy.
She was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU on [**2190-12-4**] - all
discharge instructions and appointments were advised.
