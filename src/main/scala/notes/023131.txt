Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  >= 55%  >= 55%
Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four pulmonary
veins identified and enter the left atrium.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness and cavity
size.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AS.
Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Moderate thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate [2+]
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta near the ST junction and at the ST junction.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass: Patient is AV paced on phenylepherine infusion.
Preserved Biventricular function. LVEF >55%. TR remains
moderate. Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged.
All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 95364**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization which
revealed 3 vessel native coronary disease an atretic LIMA-D1 and
[**Hospital1 **]-PDA an occluded SVG-OM and diffusely diseased SVG-LAD. She
was evaluated by cardiac surgery and underwwent the usual
preoperative workup. On [**7-22**] she was brought to the operating
room for coronary artery bypass grafting. Please see the
operative report for details in summmary she had: Redo
sternotomy, Redo coronary artery bypass graft x3 with saphenous
vein     graft to left anterior descending artery and saphenous
vein sequential grafting to posterior descending artery and
posterior left ventricular branch. Endoscopic harvesting of the
long saphenous vein. Her bypass time was 75 minutes with a
crossclamp of 56 minutes, she tolerated the operation well and
post-operatively was transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU in
stable condition. In the immediate post-operative period she
remained hemodynamically stable, she woke neurologically ontact
and was extubated. On POD1 she continued to be hemodynamically
stable and was transferred to the cardiac stepdown floor for
continued recovery. All tubes lines and drains were removed per
cardiac surgery protocol. She did have several episodes of
post-operative atrial fibrillation for which she was treated
with Bblockers, Amiodarone and coumadin. Her hematocrit was also
noted to be quite low and she therefore received a transfusion
with packed red blood cells. The remainder of her post-operative
course was uneventful.
On POD 5 she was discharged home with visiting nurses, Dr
