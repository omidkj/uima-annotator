Studies:
.
[**2102-5-12**] CXR: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Lungs are
essentially clear. There
is no evidence of pulmonary edema, focal areas of consolidation
or
pneumothorax as well as there is no evidence of appreciable
pleural effusion.
.
[**2102-5-12**] No acute intracranial pathology. Specifically, no
findings of intracranial hemorrhage or large territory infarct.
Can consider further evaluation with MRI as it is more sensitive
for acute ischemia.
.
[**2102-5-15**]: MRI/MRA head neck
No acute intracranial pathology. Specifically, no findings of
intracranial
hemorrhage or large territory infarct. Can consider further
evaluation with
MRI as it is more sensitive for acute ischemia.
.
EEG: prelim negative. final read pending


Brief Hospital Course:
# HTN/weakness/CP: On [**5-12**] in the setting of patient 3rd prbc
transfusion, patient developed rigors and HTN. Remained
hypertensive to SBP 180 despite hydralazine 30 mg IV, 2 inches
of intro paste, and SLN x3. She developed LLE weakness and
headache and started on a nitro drip. She was transferred to the
MICU for further care however BP was quickly controlled and she
was returned to the floor later the same night. Neuro was
consulted for possible code stroke, however was felt to be
unlikely given her presentation and head CT was negative.
Evaluation for transfusion rxn was negative.  She continued to
have L-sided weakness and several similar episodes of
htn/weakness/cp, which resolved with
hydralazine/ativan/morphine.  CEs and ECGs were unremarkable.
Subsequent neuro w/u with MRI/MRA and EEG were unrevealing
(final EEG read pending).
She was evaluated by psych who felt that her sxs were consistent
with Conversion Disorder and prior presentations of similar sxs,
all of which have occurred in the hospital.  She continued to
have l-sided weakness and hoarse voice, with some improvement
and fluctuating sxs in terms of character and location.  She was
sent home with assistive devices for ambulation and sl ativan.
Her htn was otherwise controlled on home meds of lisinopril,
metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide (amlodipine was not needed to
maintain her pressures in the hospital and discontinued on
discharge).  Plasma metanephrines were sent to eval for pheo in
the setting of labile bps and were pending on discharge.
.
# Anemia: Improved with blood transfusion and stable with no
further blood loss.  Her anemia was attributed to blood loss
from fibroids. EKG changes resolved and CE negative x 5 sets.
Asa was held in the setting of bleed and crit was improved on
discharge.  Could consider dc'ing PPI in outpt setting for
better iron absorption.
.
# Leukocytosis: thought to be secondary to stress reaction.  No
systemic sxs concerning for infection or localizing sxs.  She
should receive outpt f/u with repeat labs to ensure resolution.
.
# ARF: resolved with fluid repletion
.
# Out-pt follow-up:
-final read eeg
-plasma metanepherines (ordered to r/o pheo in setting labile
bps)
-amlodipine-consider restarting if pressures poorly controlled
-consider dc'ing PPI to increase iron absorption in setting of
anemia
-fibroids-consider embolization as outpt
-leukocytosis-repeat labs to ensure resolution
