Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 73 year old male who presented after a markedly
positive stress test. Cardiac cath demonstrated severe 99%
distal left main stenosis with a subtotally occluded LAD filling
via collaterals from a dominant right system which had a 60-70%
mid lesion. The patient was transferred emergently from [**Hospital 40796**] to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for
emergent coronary artery bypass grafting. Upon arrival the
patient was hemodynamically stable and chest painfree on
intravenous nitroglycerin only.

He was taken to the Operating Room on [**5-18**] and underwent
emergent coronary bypass grafting x3.  See operative note for
full details.  He tolerated the procedure well,weaning from
bypass on Neo Synephrine and Propofol infusions.
Post-operatively he was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.

POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor
support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward his preoperative weight.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes were left in for a persistent air leak with chest x-ray
showing a right basilar pneumothorax. The air leak resolved and
the right chest tube was removed with a persisitent small
basilar pneumothorax. This was stable at dischage and the
patient was assymptomatic.  Pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.

The patient was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  He had a leukocytosis to
17,700 with no obvious source or fever after POD 1. Blood
culture were sent on two days, urine culture was nagative and
his CXR was clear.  The WBC fell to 10,000 on [**5-24**] and he was
discharged home.By the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient
was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged
home with visiting nurse services in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
