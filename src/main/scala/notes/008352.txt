Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]
Chief Complaint:
Found Down


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
80 year-old F with HTN, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, mild
renal insufficiency who had EMS called after she did not make an
appearance for days. Patient is incoherent thus most of the
history is obtained from previous records. [**Name (NI) **] sister in
law ([**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3748**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 101284**]) can be contact[**Name (NI) **] in the morning
for confirmation of her information. Sister in law reported
having contact last week and the patient appeared normal without
any concerns.
.
Patient was not seen by her neighbors "for days" as they noted
her mail was piling up and subsequently they called EMS to
address their concern. EMS found an elder female that responded
to her name, but was disoriented. She was found down on her
right side on the floor, incontinent of stool and urine.
Although she couldn't give purposeful answer, she was able to
voluntarily move her extremitites. Patient was also noted to
have multiple old lacerations on her knees and elbows.
.
EMS placed a cerical spine collar and she was brought to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED. In ED patient received 30 mg of Kayexcalate; 1 amp D50, 10
units of insulin; She also received 150 mEq bicarb in 1L of NS.

.
ROS has to be defered as patient is not able to give history.

Back: no spinal tenderness, deformities appreciated.
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, 2+ radial, DP pulses
bilaterally.

.
Neurologic Exam per Neuro consult team:
-mental status: Lying in bed with eyes open, mumbling
incoherently. Inattentive. She will state her name, but does not
answer any other of the examiner's questions. Does not follow
commands. Her speech is mostly unintelligible.

-cranial nerves:  PERRL 3 to 2mm. Funduscopic exam was
technically limited as the pt repeatedly forcefully closed her
eyes on attempt to visualize fundus, but not overt papilledema.
EOMI (observed when she spontaneously looked around the room,
she
would not track however). Left eye deviated slightly to the
left.
Corneal reflex and nasal tickle present bilaterally. No overt
facial asymmetry.

-motor: Mild wasting of intrinsic muscles of the hands. Tone
increased in lower extremities. Withdraws to noxious stimuli in
all four extremities briskly, except the right arm. She was seen
to move all extremities spontaneously and purposefully, however
(e.g. attempting to pull out IV and remove nasal canula and
cervical collar). Some instances of myoclonus noted.

-sensory: Grimaces to noxious stimuli in all four extremities,
except in right arm.

-DTRs:

.
CT Head: IMPRESSION:
1. Large extra-axial right posterior fossa mass with small
calcifications suggestive of a meningioma. There is significant
mass effect on the right cerebellar hemisphere and fourth
ventricle, but no hydrocephalus is seen.
2. Tiny focus of hyperdensity along the lateral left frontal
lobe, which is likely artifactual.
.
MRI Head:
IMPRESSION: Limited examination due to patient motion artifact.
The patient's right cerebellopontine angle meningioma has
dramatically increased in size and now has considerable mass
effect upon the underlying cerebellum and brain stem. There is
displacement and compression of the fourth ventricle, however,
there is no evidence of hydrocephalus with no change in the
configuration of the lateral ventricles from [**2125-11-22**].
.
MR C/s [**10-16**]:
1. Ligamentous injury cannot be ruled out in the setting of
limited
examination due to severe motion artifact.
2. Severe spinal canal narrowing at the levels of C2-3 and C3-4
as described above. Increased T2 signal in the spinal cord at
the same level, that could be due to chronic stenosis changes,
however contusion of the spinal cord cannot be ruled out in the
setting of trauma.
3. Spinal cord atrophy at the level of C4-5. Syrinx at the level
of C4 and C4-5 disc.
4. Posterior fossa mass, previously characterized as meningioma.

.
CT head [**10-16**]:
IMPRESSION: Large right cerebellopontine angle meningioma with
mass effect upon the fourth ventricle and brainstem.
The lateral ventricles are slightly more prominent than on the
prior
examination, which could be a sign of early hydrocephalus.
.
CXR ([**10-17**]):
Compared with [**2131-10-11**], an NGT is now present with its tip near
the lower edge of the image in the proximal stomach, with the
proximal sidehole marker below the GE junction. The heart,
lungs, and mediastinum are unremarkable.
.
TTE:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**11-27**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 y.o. F with HTN, CRI, GERD, brought to [**Hospital1 18**] after having
found down for presumable several days.  Patient found to be in
acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, and profound encephalopathy
with newly discovered 3x4 cm meningioma.
.
In the MICU, her electrolytes improved to a creatinine of 5.8
and a K of 4.3. Her sodium rose slowly to 151 but she could not
receive free water due to increased ICP. She had an MRI
confirming the large mass (see report below). Her mental status
slowly improved to the point where she could answer questions
intermittently. An NGT was unable to be placed [**12-28**] coiling in
mouth. She was begun on decadro
