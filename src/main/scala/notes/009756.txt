History of Present Illness:
HPI: 63 yo metastatic carcinoid, HTN, hyperlipidemia, s/p recent
admission to [**Hospital1 18**] (d/cd [**8-21**]) who presents with altered mental
status. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**2127-8-1**] with DOE and orthopnea.
Pt had a RLL PNA with b/l effusions (transudative on tap) and
CHF. He was found to have a decreased EF to 35-40%, and P-MIBI
showed moderate reversible defects in the apex and septum.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2127-8-15**] showed mild coronary artery
disease (prox RCA 40%, mid-LAD 50%, 20% stenosis at D2),
elevated RV and LV filling pressures, severely depressed EF,
moderate pulm HTN, mild aortic stenosis (mean gradient 10) with
a restrictive defect. Course was complicated by ARF secondary to
overdiuresis as well as contrast nephropathy, and shock liver.
.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital 38**] Rehab from [**Hospital1 18**]. He developed
some altered mental status and confusion on [**2127-8-22**]. He also was
found to be hypoxic yesterday to 80s on RA with improvement with
diuresis. Today, pt desatted to 80% at rehab, "was blue in the
face",  and had altered mental status. He was transferred to
[**Hospital6 33**]. Head CT report showed central and
peripheral atrophy, though no mass or hemorrhage. Pt was then
transferred here as most of his care is here. He was noted to be
A&O x 2 initially in ED, then x 0. He was able to speak small
amounts and follow commands initially.
.
In ED,  VS: T: 101.6, HR: 94, BP: 126/52; RR:17; O2: 88RA, 100
4L.
An LP was performed and pt was given Ceftriaxone 2 grams IV x 1,
Vancomycin 1 gram IV x 1, Dexamethasone 13.5 mg IV x 1. Initial
ABG 7.55/29/123/26.
.
Of note, per daughters report, pt had confusion, paranoid
ideations in days prior to d/c from [**Hospital1 **] (no d/c summ yet). also
with this at rehab. Never had this before.


Past Medical History:

for a year and a half (ended about a year ago) and was on
octreotide for a few months earlier this year but stopped

2. hypertension
3. hyperlipidemia
4. carotid endarterectomy [**2120**]
5. depression/anxiety
6. cellulitis 4 weeks ago, given Keflex IV at [**Hospital3 **], now resolved
7. DM2/prediabetic state: random blood sugar was high, was on
glyburide for a brief time but made his sugars low so stopped

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF OVERVIEW:
63 yo male with metastatic carcinoid, HTN, DM, CHF, recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after prolonged course [**1-29**] pneumonia,
admitted to the ICU with MS changes, now with improving mental
status but continued edema and s/s heart failure R>L thought to
be from carcinoid heart.  The patient was transfered to the
floor from the ICU as his mental status improved.  He was
treated with diuretics for heart failure, placed on telemetry,
electrolytes monitored, and had good UOP after an initially poor
UOP.  The patient appeared to be doing well and then went into V
Tach, V fib, and eventually died after a prolonged resuscitation
attempt.
.
1. Mental Status change - The differential diagnosis of etiology
of encephalopathic state was thought to include serotonin
syndrome, underlying pneumonia and bacteremia and acute renal
failure (consistent with asterixis). Encephalitis/ meningitis
was initially entertained, but was thought to be unlikely as CSF
was negative.  The patient was found to becteremic by blood cx
on [**2127-8-23**] ([**3-31**] positive GPC).  The pt was covered with
vancomycin.  The cultures turned out to be growing MRSE and
vancomycin was continued.  The patient remained afebrile and
cultures thereafter remained negative. SSRI was stopped to
prevent worsening of seratonin state.  Ativan was initially used
on the floor to sedate the patient when he was agitated/anxious,
however this was held after one day as it was noted to increase
his sedation/confusion.  As the patient diuresed, infection
cleared, and meds were held, he became more oriented and more
alert.  Whereas he had some paranoia regarding CIA agents on
admission to the ICU and in the day prior, these delusions
resolved on transfer to the floor.
.
2. Fluid status-  The patient was known to have an EF of 35% on
a prior echocardiogram.  He had received a total of 5L of fluid
in the ICU to support pressure working under the assumption that
the patient was intravascularly dry but total volume overloaded.
 Repeat echo showed an EF at this hospitalization of 20-25%.
Severe TR and elevated R-sided pressures were thought to be from
carcinoid heart.  His lungs remained somewhat dull to
ausc/percussion, but he exhibited no crackles.  Based on his
large JVD and edema and these lung findings, it was thought that
he continued to have the R heart failure physiology seen on echo
at this hospitalizat
