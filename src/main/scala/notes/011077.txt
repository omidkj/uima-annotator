History of Present Illness:
69 year old woman with primary sclerosing cholangitis with
cirrhosis (decompensated with ascites, hydrothorax, and
encephalopathy) who presents from rehab facility with 4/4 GNR in
blood.

She was recently admitted with worsening abdominal distension
and shortness of breath (like from increased ascites). She had
several issues that should be considered seperately:
.
1. CXR showed a RLL opacity that was concerning for pneumonia.
Found to have Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia, and completed a
2 week course of Cefepime and Bactrim (sensitive to both). Her
course ended [**8-31**]. Repeat blood cultures on [**8-28**] were negative.
She then spiked to 102.4 on [**9-7**] and was pancultured.  She was
started back on vancomycin and cefepime.  Her cultures then grew
out 4/4 bottles of VRE (unknown source). She was started on
daptomycin and developed a drug rash that was ultimately
determined (by conference with ID, derm and liver) to be related
to cefepime. She was discharged to complete a course on [**2108-9-23**]
and to resume GNR prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin 500mg daily (ID
wanted to start this given her large ascites)
.
2. She is s/p chest tube placement and removal for massive
pleural effusion.
.
3.She had a LGI bleed from external hemorrhoids on [**9-4**] and had
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and EGD which showed grade 3 varices.  She got 2 units of
blood and remained stable.
.
She presents today with symptoms that recapitulate the excellent
dc summary from [**Hospital **] rehab. Namely, she was discharged to the
[**Hospital1 100**] MACU for rehab and to complete the course of her
daptomycin. Since then she was seen in daycare ofr a 4 para
w/albumin on [**9-20**]. On [**9-22**], she spiked to 102.0. Blood cultures,
CXR and UA/UCx were ordered in a reflexive fever workuup. A CXR
demonstrated a RUL and LLL infiltrate with persistent bilateral
effsuions, worse than those evaluated on [**9-15**]. On [**9-24**] bcx
came back postive for GNR. Urine was positive for 2 types of GNR
with 10 and 20K colonies. She had a WBC of 8.8, HCT 25.5, plt
163; Na 138, K 5.0, CO 20, cr 0.7 and bun of 24. She was given
20mg of IV lasix with nebulizers with 500 cc of UOP. A decision
was made to transfer. With stable vital signs, she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a thorough evaluation. Much of which
was undertaken by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, Ms. [**Known lastname 69849**] VS were: 98 76 122/50 24 95on4L. By my
evaluation, these were 123/63, 93, 26, 97on4l. She received a
CXR that revealed, as above, new opacity in RUL, effusions as
before. A dx para was negative for SBP. And her labs, below,
were within her baseline. she received 1g of meropenem at 5:30
and two PIV's were placed.

CXR ([**9-23**]):

IMPRESSION: New right upper lobe opacity concerning for
infection. Large
right effusion and left basilar atelectasis.
.
CXR ([**9-29**]) - after 2 thoracenteses during hospitalization
Large right pleural effusion with almost white-out of the right
hemithorax is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal contours cannot be
evaluated. Small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis
is stable. There is no evident pneumothorax. Left PICC remains
in place.
.
MRI/MRCP ([**9-27**]):
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to motion, patient unable to
cooperate, IV and oral contrast was not administrated.
.
1. Cirrhosis and segments of hepatic atrophy affecting the liver
with
fibrosis in keeping with patient's underlying primary sclerosing
cholangitis.
2. Similar degree of intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. No
evidence to
suggest infected bile lakes.
3. Non-occlusive thrombus in the main portal vein, suboptimally
evaluated due to motion; however has not propagated into
occlusive thrombus in the interval.
4. Moderate right pleural effusion and atelectasis at the lung
bases.
5. Ascites, with interval increase in size compared to most
recent MRCP.
6. Splenomegaly.
