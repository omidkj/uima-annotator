Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is an 88 year old male with a medical history of a-fib on
coumadin, HTN, who presents from heb reb with shortness of
breath.  Patient was just discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] for a prolonged
hospital course for pneumonia ans sepsis.  During that
hospitalization he grew VRE from his blood and required
intubation.  He was intubated likely for a mix of volume
overload and pneumonia.  After a large diuresis he was able to
be extubated.  He was discharged from the hosptial with
intermittent 2L O2 requirement.
.
At [**Hospital **] rehab he was doing well until [**5-28**] in the am.  He was
noted to have increasing tachypnea and low O2 on room air.  He
did not have any complaints but given his recent pneumonia,
tachypnea, hypoxia and tachycardia he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
evaluation.

78 on room air in ED.

In the ED his initial vitals were: 99.6 118 135/68 36 95% 2L
(78% on ra per verbal sign out).  Exam was notable for right
sided rales.  Labs were notable for WBC of 9.9, hct of 39, BNP
of 679, lactate of 2.9.  A chest X-ray was grossly volume
overloaded with concern for a right sided infiltrate.  He was
given Linezolid and cefepime in the ED alond with alb/ipra nebs.
 His blood pressure dipped into high 90s but responded with
500cc bolus.  On transfer 98% on 5L.  HR: 105, SBP 120s, 20-30.
One PIV for access.  Given the concern for recurrent pneumonia
and hypoxia to 5L he was admited to the ICU.

Imaging:
========
Chest X-Ray:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities which may
be due to
infection and/or aspiration.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
88 year-old Russian-speaking M with Dementia, suspected COPD,
AFib on Coumadin, HTN who presented with hypoxia and tachypnea.
.
# Hypoxia/tachypnea: likely in setting of volume overload given
worsening pulmonary edema and effusions on CXR though aspiration
may also be a component. Precipitant for volume overload is not
clear though includes accumulation of fluid over past few days,
possibly tachycardia or hypertension causing flash pulmonary
edema, or aspiration causing tachycardia and fluid retention. He
was initially requiring 5L nasal cannula and was diuresed with
IV lasix, improving to 2L and room air the following day. He is
currently being treated with linezolid for HCAP from recent
admission (last day of antibiotic on [**2161-6-3**]). Recent TTE showed
normal systolic ejection fraction though likely has some
diastolic dysfunction. Low suspicion for PE given improvement
with diuresis and tachycardia likely in setting of hypoxemia.
Patient does have chronic aspiration and speech/swallow
recommended a diet of pureed solids and honey thickened liquids.
Patient was discharged on lasix 20mg PO daily and should have
his weights and electrolytes monitored frequently at rehab and
lasix dose adjusted appropriately. Discharged on 2L nasal
cannula for supplemental oxygen which can be weaned down as
tolerated. Can continue on albuterol nebulizers as needed for
dyspnea.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: patient is anticoagulated on coumadin and
takes aspirin 325mg daily. INR on this admission was 1.6 and he
was continued on coumadin 3mg daily. On this admission he was in
sinus rhythm with first degree AV block with no a fib. He was
slightly tachycardic as above, which is likely in the setting of
hypoxemia. He should have his INR monitored frequently for a
goal of [**2-5**].
.
# BPH/Urinary Obstruction: continued tamsulosin at home dose.
.
# Creatinine: elevated to 1.1 from baseline of 0.7.  Recently
with [**Last Name (un) **] during last hospitalization. 1-1.[**5-3**] be new baseline.
He is being discharged on lasix 20mg daily for diuresis and
should have his Cr checked twice weekly in order to adjust lasix
dose if it continues to rise. His diet is also being modified to
honey thickened liquids which may decrease PO intake, so PO
fluid intake should be encouraged.
.
# Suspected COPD: albuterol nebulizer as needed
.
