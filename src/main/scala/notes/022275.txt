most recent echocardiogram in [**2113-3-3**] revealed a
severely dilated left ventricle with mild hypertrophy of the
septum.  Ejection fraction was 55%.  His aortic valve had
moderate to severe aortic insufficiency and mild to moderate
restriction.  Peak gradient was 55 mm Hg, with an estimated
aortic valve area of 1.9 cm sq.  Aortic root was moderately
dilated, and the mitral valve had probable moderate mitral
regurgitation.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] has noticed some shortness of
breath and fatigue with heavy exertion.  He occasionally
feels palpitations, but denies chest pain.  He now presents
to [**Hospital1 69**] for aortic valve
surgery by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Rheumatic heart disease/valve disease
2.  Mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
3.  Hyperlipidemia
4.  Tonsillectomy
5.  Hernia repair
6.  Splenectomy for traumatic accident

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has smoked two to three
cigarettes a day for 30 years.

MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor, Lotrel which the patient recently
stopped on his own.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile, vital signs
are stable.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  His neck is supple,
with no palpable masses.  His lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  His heart is regular rate and rhythm, with a
III/VI murmur.  The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended,

cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room
on [**2113-8-16**] for aortic valve replacement and aortic graft.
The aortic valve was a 29 mm SJ mechanical valve.  The aortic
graft for his aortic dilatation was a 30 mm Hemashield graft.
The procedure was performed without complication, and Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was subsequently transferred to the Cardiac Surgery
Intensive Care Unit.  In the Unit, he was extubated and
weaned off drips.  He was fluid resuscitated.  Coumadin
therapy was started for his valve replacement.

Mr. [**Known lastname 104989**] stay in the Intensive Care Unit was uneventful,
and he was then transferred to the floor on the evening of
postoperative day one.  On the floor, Mr. [**Known lastname **] did have one
episode of atrial fibrillation with exertion.  This episode
lasted approximately one minute, and he converted to sinus
rhythm without intervention.  Also during his stay on the
floor, Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed some right eye vision changes. The
patient stated that he had had similar problems prior to the
surgery. He was evaluated by Ophthalmology, who observed a
possible peripheral retinal artery embolus.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] will be
followed and evaluated in [**Hospital 8183**] Clinic.  Visual field
testing will be performed at this time.

rate 72, blood pressure 122/64, respirations 18, oxygen
saturation 95% on room air.  His heart is regular rate and
rhythm.  The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, with normal
active bowel sounds.  His incision is clean, dry and intact.
