[**2101-11-14**] Liver US : 1. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary
dilatation of common bile duct measuring up to 5 mm.
2. Gallbladder sludge. Suggestion of mild gallbladder wall
thickening
without other secondary signs of cholecystitis. Overall,
findings are
equivocal. Consider HIDA scan if clinical suspicion for
cholecystitis in this patient with CT documented pancreatitis.

[**2101-11-14**] Abd CT : 1. No CT evidence of cholangitis.
  2. Unchanged appearance of the gallbladder, with CT appearance
borderline for acute cholecystitis. As previously recommended,
nuclear hepatobiliary scan may be helpful for further evaluation
if the clinical scenario remains unclear.
  3. [**Name2 (NI) 84924**]c inflammatory changes could represent acute
pancreatitis.  Alternatively, as the inflammatory changes are
largely centered around the distal pancreas in the region of
prior partial pancreatectomy, and in the left anterior pararenal
space, consideration should be given to recurrent leak from the
surgical site.
  4. 2.6 cm left lower quadrant amorphous low-density structure,
with
peripheral enhancement and mild surrounding inflammatory change.
Most
probably, this represents an area of fat necrosis.
5. Evolution of right renal infarction.

  [**2101-11-14**] ERCP : A plastic stent placed in the pancreatic duct
was found in the major papilla. On scout film the prior PD stent
and bullet were seen.
Stent in the major papilla.
After multiple attempts at cannulation were unsuccessful, small
pre-cut needle knife sphincterotomy was performed.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
There was a filling defect that appeared like sludge in the
lower third of the common bile duct.
A biliary sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Sludge was extracted successfully using a balloon catheter.

[**2101-11-15**] HIDA scan : Non-visualization of the gallbladder out to
three hours.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15655**] was admitted to the hospital, made NPO and hydrated
with IV fluids. He was blood cultured and placed on IV Unasyn
for a working diagnosis of cholangitis.
His initial ultrasound showed some sludge in the gallbladder and
some wall thickening and a HIDA scan was recommended.  He
remained afebrile and had less abdominal pain and a decreasing
WBC.  Due to his multiple ERCP's and pancreatic stents over the
last few months an ERCP was done first to ensure patency of the
stent.  The stent was patent but he had a filling defect in the
lower third of the CBD and subsequently underwent
sphincterotomy.  A HIDA scan was done on [**2101-11-15**] and the
Gallbladder was not visualized after three hours, not unexpected
after sphincterotomy He was started on a diabetic, low fat diet
and had no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.  His WBC was down
to 13K and he was afebrile.  His IV Unasyn was changed to
Augmentin to complete a 7 day course.

Since his admission to the hospital he had uncontrolled
hypertension with blood pressures in the 180/110 range.  He
admitted to having stopped his lopressor 75 TID about one week
ago as he thought it was unnecessary.  He was treated on the
Trauma floor with additional doses of lopressoe plus hydralazine
but his blood pressure was still high.  Briefly he was
transferred to the ICU for IV Labetalol which effectively
lowered his pressure and he maintained better control on
Lopressor 75 mg PO QID and hydralazine.

His Unasyn was changed to Augmentin after his diet was resumed
and he will be on it for a 7 day course which will end [**2101-11-21**].
 His blood sugars were in the 180-210 range off his NPH and oral
hypoglycemics.  These medications were resumed after he began
taking a regular diabetic, low fat diet and his sugars were in
better control.
He was discharged to home on [**2101-11-16**] and will follow up with
his PCP next week for blood pressure monitoring and blood sugar
evaluation.
