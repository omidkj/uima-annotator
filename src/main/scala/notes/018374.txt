Reason: eval for effusion
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   43 year old woman s/p MVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for effusion
Provisional Findings Impression: YMf MON [**2108-10-15**] 2:08 PM
Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions. No pulmonary
edema. Right
internal jugular line appears to be kinked at the site of
insertion, direct
examination is recommended.
Final Report
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: 43-year-old woman post-MVR.

COMPARISON: [**2108-10-12**].

FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bilateral
pleural
effusions have decreased. The aeration of the left lower lobe
has slightly
improved. There is no pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or new
consolidation.
The appearance of the sternal wires and plates is stable. The
right internal
jugular central venous catheter ends in the mid-to-lower
superior vena cava,
catheter appears kinked at the site of the entrance in the skin,
clinical
correlation suggested.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and underwent Mitral Valve Replacement
(#25/33mm On-X Mechanical Valve)/Patent foramen ovale
closure/Left atrial appendage ligation) with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Cross
clamp time=72 minutes. Cardiopulmonary bypass time= 89 minutes.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred intubated
and sedated to the CVICU.  See operative report for further
surgical details. She awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident on POD#1. CPAP for obstructive sleep
apnea was initiated which she wears at home, along with
aggressive pulmonary hygiene. Anticoagulation with Coumadin was
initiated. INR goal for mechanical valve 3.0-3.5. All lines and
drains were discontinued in a timely fashion with criteria met.
Aspirin/Beta-blocker/statin started. POD#3 Heparin bridge to
therapeutic INR was begun. She continued to progress and was
transferred to the step down unit. Physical therapy was
consulted for evaluation of increased mobility and strength. The
remainder of her postoperative course was essentially
uneventful. She continued to progress and was cleared by
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for discharge to home, on post operative day six.
