Imaging:
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**6-28**]:
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained from the thoracic
inlet to the
symphysis pubis with the administration of IV contrast. Coronal
and sagittal reformations were obtained.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart and pericardium are
unremarkable, without pericardial effusion. Few scattered
mediastinal lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged. The
great vessels are within normal limits. Minimal atherosclerotic
coronary artery calcifications are noted. There is centrilobular
emphysema, with numerous bilateral metastatic lesions scattered
throughout the lungs. There is a mass in the right upper lobe
which measures 7.1 cm x 5.9 cm (3:18), that is heterogeneous in
appearance, with areas of necrosis. The largest lesion in the
right lower lobe is a bilobed mass or two adjacent masses, which
measure approximately 5.4 cm x 4.0 cm. The largest lesion in the
left lower lobe (3:29) measures 2.8 cm x 2.4 cm, and the largest
lesion in the left upper lobe measures 2.2 cm x 1.9 cm. No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver is diffusely low
in
attenuation, consistent with fatty infiltration. There are
scattered rounded hypodensities in the right lobe, with an
exophytic lesion arising from the inferior right lobe (3:68),
measuring 2.2 cm, suspicious for a metastatic lesion. The
gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and left adrenal gland are
normal. The kidneys demonstrate slightly lobulated contours,
which could reflect sequela from prior insult, but are otherwise
unremarkable. There is a heterogeneous lobulated large mass
arising from the right adrenal gland which measures 8.4 cm
craniocaudad x 5.0 cm transverse. Additional heterogeneous
masses are seen within the periportal region, with a mass
measuring approximately 3.0 cm x 2.8 cm (3:62). The stomach,
small bowel, and large bowel are unremarkable. Adjacent to the
stomach antrum in the peritoneal fat is a lobulated irregular
mass, which
measures approximately 5.4 cm x 6.0 cm (3:70). There are
scattered nodules
throughout the peritoneum, with one adjacent to the transverse
colon (3:56) measuring 9 mm, as well as irregular mass posterior
to the right psoas muscle (3:70) measuring 3.0 cm x 1.9 cm. No
free air or free fluid is identified.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder and
rectum are
unremarkable. Patient is status post hysterectomy. There is an
irregular
hypodense lesion in the expected location of the right adnexa
(3:96), which measures 2.7 cm x 2.6 cm. This could reflect the
right ovary. Alternatively, this could represent a metastatic
lesion. No pelvic free fluid or adenopathy is identified.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are diffuse osseous metastases, with
scattered
sclerotic foci seen within the pelvis as well as scattered
throughout the
vertebral column (predominantly thoracic). Additionally, there
are wedge
compressions at the T7 and T8 vertebral bodies, of uncertain
chronicity.
Sclerotic foci are also present within bilateral ribs,
compatible with
metastatic lesions. Incompletely assessed sclerotic focus also
seen in the
right humeral head.
IMPRESSION:
1. Widespread metastatic disease, including innumerable
bilateral pulmonary masses, as well as probable hepatic lesion,
right adrenal mass, and nodules/masses scattered throughout the
peritoneum and mesentery.
2. Diffuse sclerotic osseous metastasis with wedge compressions
of T7 and T8 of uncertain chronicity.

MRI Head [**6-30**]:
Comparison is made with MRI performed at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on
[**2166-6-26**].
FINDINGS:
There is a tract in the right frontal lobe relating to recent
3rd
ventriculostomy. Multiple enhancing supra- and infratentorial
lesions are
stable including a large lesion in the right cerebellum with
significant mass effect on the fourth ventricle. Some of the
lesions appear to be
leptomeningeal, particularly in the left frontal lobe.
The ventricles are stable in size and configuration. There is a
small amount of pneumocephalus. There is no evidence for acute
ischemia. There is suggestion of multiple calvarial enhancing
lesions which could represent me
