[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12262**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2183-7-20**] for surgical
management of his mitral valve disease. He was worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner including an abdominal ultrasound
which was negative for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His renal
arteries were normal as well and not a factor in his
hypertension. On [**2183-7-22**], Mr. [**Known lastname 12262**] was taken to the operating
room where he underwent a mitral vale repair utilizing a 28mm
[**Last Name (un) 3843**] [**Doctor Last Name **] annuloplasty band. Postoperatively he was
taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 12262**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. He was then transferred
to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. Mr.
[**Known lastname 12262**] was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. His drains and wires were
removed per protocol. An ace inhibitor was started for afterload
reduction. Beta blockade was titrated for optimal heart rate and
blood pressure control. Mr. [**Known lastname 12262**] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged home on postoperative day eight. He
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], his cardiologist and his
primary care physician as an outpatient.
