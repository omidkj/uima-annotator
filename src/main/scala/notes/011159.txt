biopsy mediastinal mass.


History of Present Illness:
69 yo M w HTN, Afib, DM, recent dysphagia and newly diagnosed
mediastinal mass. Pt briefly hospitalized last month for
bronchitis, when mass was initially identified. Since then he
has had worsening dysphagia, to the point of only tolerating
minimal liquids. He recently underwent biopsy by IP 5d prior to
admission and since has had worsening cough with productive
yellow sputum, fevers to 104.5 and chills. Also reports nasal
congestion, slight SOB, sore throat, nausea and occasional
vomiting. Pt denied lightheadedness, dizziness
.
In the emergency department initial vitals were T102.4 HR111
BP125/69 RR22 O2100%RA. CXR revealed bibasilar PNA and stable
mediastinal mass. Pt received Vanc, Levofloxacin, Tylenol, as
well as 3L IVF. Blood cultures were sent, Flu swab done and
Tamiflu given. Labs were significant for leukocytosis, acute
kidney injury but normal lactate. Given persistent hypotension
into 80s-90s, pt admitted to ICU for furthur workup. Vitals
prior to transfer T98.4, HR82, BP90/46, RR23, O2100% on RA

Past Medical History:
1) HTN
2) Afib
3) DM
4) Gout
5) Dysphagia: differential diagnosis for his dysphagia includes
esophageal cancer, metastatic cancer or local invasion to
esophagus.
CT scan [**11-24**]: 1. Large soft tissue mass centered in the
posterior mediastinum directly adjacent to the mediastinal
structures and compressing the esophagus, the differential
diagnosis includes lymphoma, neurogenic tumor, lung carcinoma
(small-cell carcinoma) and GI stromal tumor. Esophageal
carcinoma is very unlikely. FNA without malignant evidence,
pathology pending.

STUDIES:
CXR: Bibasilar airspace opacities worrisome for infection or
aspiration. Unchanged large superior mediastinal mass.

EKG: NSR at 77, slightly leftward axis, left atrial enlargement,
partial RBBB, lateral concave <1mm ST elevations c/w early
repolarization - pt symptomatic.

[**2140-12-9**]: AP chest compared to [**12-8**]:
Lateral aspect of the left lower chest and the extreme lung
apices are
excluded from the examination. Nasogastric tube can be traced as
far as the
distal stomach but the tip is indistinct. Stomach has been
decompressed.
Intestinal distention noted in the imaged portion of the upper
abdomen.
Right basal atelectasis stable. More severe opacification at the
left lung
base also probably atelectasis grossly unchanged but
incompletely imaged.
Pleural effusions are small if any. Upper lungs clear. Heart
size normal.
Upper mediastinal mass stable.

CT chest: 0/28/09:
IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly increased size of posterior mediastinal mass with
stable
appearance to satellite lesions including a nodule in the
lingula.
2. Increased size of now moderate pleural effusions with
associated relaxation atelectasis.
3. Essentially stable appearance to renal cysts.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Mediastinal mass: He had a history of progressive dysphagia
with outpatient workup and biopsy with pathology pending at time
of admission.  Mass had been growing quickly and was possibly
limiting PO intake and also worsening respiratory distress.  On
[**12-6**] path returned with findings suspicious for small cell lung
carcinoma, but given necrotic sample, recommended further
biopsy.  Pt was taken for repeat broncoscopy on [**12-7**] with
interventional pulmonology, however the sample was
nondiagnostic.  In the meantime, it was determined that the
previous sample was sufficient for diagnosis of carcinoma.  Pt
was then taken for intubation and rigid bronchoscopy with
bronchial stenting then transfered to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for
oncology and radiation treatment.  Had ECHO showing no
hemodynamic compromise of the mass.  CT head with contrast
showed no ICH or abnormal enhancement. Underwent mapping for XRT
followed by first XRT treatment on [**2140-12-7**], and second
treatment on [**2140-12-12**].
He will receive a total of 10 treatments. He plans to commute
from [**Hospital1 189**] where he will live with his sister, to [**Hospital1 18**] for
therapy. He is scheduled to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
interventional pulmonology on [**1-9**] for stent removal.
.
#. Pneumonia: He presented with fevers, cough, hypotension and
CXR with inflitrate.  In the setting of frequent hospital visits
as well as instrumentalization, he was given Vanc/Levo in the
ED, then switched to Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin. Antibiotics
were changed to vanc/Zosyn on [**2140-12-8**], then narrowed to just
Zosyn and azithromycin on [**2140-12-9**]. He was discharged on oral
azithromycin and cefpodoxime  with plan for total 14 day abx
course. Influenza testing was negative as were blood and urine
cultures, although sputum cultures could not be read due to
contamination with oropharyngeal organisms. Required pressors
overnight on hospital day one, which were then weaned off, and
he remained hemodynamically stable on the floor. He had some
deconditioning from the infection and lung cancer. He was seen
by physical therapy who recommended outpatient physical therapy.

.
#. Acute Renal Failure: This was likely prerenal.  His
creatinine trended down with fluids and urine output remained
adequate.
.
#. A Fib: He was found to be in atrial fibrillation and
experienced episodic RVR. He was placed on a diltiazem drip with
additional rate control with Propafenone.  His anticoagulation
was held in the setting of procedurization and he was given 2
units of FFP. He converted back into sinus rymthm. He was
restarted on his home coumadin dosing.
.
#.  Diabetes:  Stable.  He was kept on insulin sliding scale,
and his Metformin held.
