History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 F with PMH anxiety and depression who was
initially admitted on [**2102-10-10**] for ischemic left foot s/p
heparinazation and thrombectomy with left leg fasciotomy.
Course complicated by hypotension and hypoxia after extubation,
found to have PCP pneumonia, HIV with CD4 11.  The patient was
transferred to MICU for treatment of her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].  Was
started on bactrim, as well as steroid taper.  Her O2
requirements while in the unit were 4L NC, satting in the low to
mid 90s.  The patient frequently desatted while in the unit to
the mid 80s in the context of taking off her nasal cannula or
any physical activity.  Her O2 sats improved with putting on NC
and resting.  The patient had an interesting affect in the unit
and based on CD4 count, it was decided that brain imaging was
indicated.

CVL pulled night prior to ICU transfer.  Increased delirium the
morning of transfer.  Looked ill-appearing, more so than usual.
Dropped sats into 70s on facemask, and then switched to NRB and
went back up to 100% but then was unresponsive, glaced over, not
responding to commands.  Increased lethargy and was becoming
more and more altered.  Received 40 mg IV lasix on transit to
ICU.
The patient was then transferred to the floor.
1. PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 11091**]: While she was there she was continued on her bactrim
and prednisone taper for her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
2. acute occipital stroke: The patient had subsequent head
imaging on the floor, which revealed an acute occipital stroke,
most likely embolic.  Work up for embolic stroke included bubble
echo that did not show e/o right to left shunt or thrombosis.
TEE not done because at the time pt was too sick to tolerate it.

3. new HIV dx:  ID was following the patient while on the floor.
 CMV viral load was 20,000.  ID recs re: valacyclovir still
pending.  ID was concerned about cryptococal meningitis, but the
patient has been refusing LP.  ID did not want to start HAART
before cryptococal was ruled out because of [**Doctor First Name **].  Antigen
negative, but patient refused LP. ID thought it was ok to start
HAART.  But LFTs a/n still a barrier to starting HAART.
4. diarrhea: stool studies pending; up to 6 BMs daily
5. vascular still following: when erythema stops expanding, then
will consider amputation.  Not going to happen this
hospitalization.  Con't heparin/coumadin. [**Doctor First Name **] was d/ced
6. sinus tachycardia: had intermittent bursts of tachycardia;
looked sinus on tele, but no 12 lead was done.

Past Medical History:
1. Depression
2. Anxiety

Social History:
Ceased tobacco use 12 weeks ago, formerly smoked 1 ppd x 30
years, denies EtOH consumption, and denies recreational drug use

IMAGING
[**11-3**] MRI HEAD TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, axial T1, axial FLAIR,
axial T2, axial T2 star and diffusion-weighted MR imaging of the
brain was obtained without the administration of contrast.
COMPARISON: None available.
FINDINGS: There is an area of restricted diffusion in the right
occipital
lobe with corresponding hypointensity on ADC images consistent
with acute
infarction. Small foci of hemorrhage are seen within this
region. There is
surrounding edema and cortical swelling. No evidence of mass
effect is seen.  No shift of normally midline structures. The
ventricles and uninvolved sulci are within normal limits for a
patient of this age. The major intracranial vessel flow voids
are preserved.
IMPRESSION: Right occipital infarction with small areas of
hemorrhage. No
shift of normally midline structures.
.
[**11-7**] CT HEAD INDICATION: Patient with altered mental status
requiring intubation, new
diagnosis of HIV and occipital stroke.

COMPARISONS: MR brain of [**2102-11-3**] and CT brain of
[**2102-11-4**]

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired contiguous images through the brain
were obtained
without intravenous contrast at 5-mm slice thickness. Coronally
and
sagittally reformatted images were displayed.

FINDINGS:

There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, recent
infarction, or shift
of normally midline structures. Confluent hypodensity involving
right
occipital lobe (2:20), corresponds to the area of patient's
known occipital
infarction and appears slightly more conspicuous from [**2102-11-4**]
exam. The
sulci and ventricles are prominent, likely age related
involutional changes.
Basal cisterns are patent.

Mucosal thickening of the sphenoid sinus is noted. Otherwise,
