Brief Hospital Course:
#. Dyspnea: Patient with known history and multiple prior
admissions with clinical exam consistent with COPD exacerbation.
 He improved with nebs and steroids. His ABG on the floor was
7.35/52/175/30 was consistent with compensated respiratory
acidosis. Given patient's normal pH and chronically elevated
bicarb, this is likely his baseline. Pt exacerbation likely in
the setting of med non-compliance. No evidence of infection on
CXR, afebrile, no WBC, although pt with elevated lactate. No
evidence of volume overload or infiltrate. Low suspicion for PE.
 Discharged on steroid taper and Albuterol Sulfate 90
mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler.

#. Hypertension: Pt BP is SBP 140's. Continued his home BP meds.


#. Chronic Renal Insuff: Pt with Cr 1.3 which is near his recent
baseline. Continued home BP regimen of HCTZ and ACE-I and
monitored closely.

#. Anemia: Hematocrit on admission 36.5 down to 31.3 with
baseline of 30-35.  Previous iron studies showed iron
deficiency.  Email sent to PCP to suggest further workup of
causes of his iron deficiency anemia.

#. BPH: Continued home doxazosin.

#. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Stable but may be elevated in the
setting of steriods. Given statin for cardiac protection.

#. GERD: Stable, continued PPI.

#. Hyperlipidemia: Stable, continued home statin.
