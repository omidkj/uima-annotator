History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 101121**] is a 76 year old male with h/o pancreatic
cancer (dx [**2113-1-2**]) s/p Whipple procedure in [**12-28**] found to be
metastatic on CT in [**6-27**], COPD, and HTN who presented to the ED
early yesterday a.m. N/V and abdominal pain. He had been
admitted on [**8-1**] to the medicine service for decreased PO intake,
felt to be multifactorial.  He was then readmitted from
[**Date range (1) 6106**] to the surgery service for partial SBO that appeared
to resolve. Of note, his anion gap during that admission was
elevated to 19, and 15 on discharge.  He was tolerating small
amounts of PO on discharge.  He says that he still had abdominal
pain on discharge, but over the last day he also developed
nausea and vomitted 3 times, prompting his return to the ED.
His vomitus is non-bloody, non-bilious, with food particles.
His last bowel movement was 2 days ago while inpatient.  He
denies any melena or hematochezia.  No fevers, chills, SOB,
cough, urinary frequency or dysuria.
.
He has had decreased appetite with occasional N/V for the last
month or so, and per report, has had a 40 pound weight loss
since [**12-28**].  He has intermittent band-like abdominal pain and
takes dilaudid/percocet PRN.
.
In the ED the patient appeared comfortable, with a mildly tender
abdomen.  VS were 96.3, 94, 122/74, RR 16, 97% RA.  A KUB showed
dilated small bowel loops improved since last KUB.  Surgery did
not feel the patient had a surgical abdomen.  His labs were
notable for an HCO3 of 18, with a gap of 20, a glucose of 286,
and a WBC count of 23 which is actually lower than usual.  A UA
showed ketonuria and glucosuria.  He was given 5 U SQ regular
insulin and admitted to the medicine floor.  On the floor he
received 2x 10U of insulin. His AG increased to 21, with a
glucose of 300, and he was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

AXR [**8-10**]: Decreased dilatation of bowel when compared to
[**2113-8-7**] with interval passage of air to the rectum and colon.

.
AXR ([**8-6**]): IMPRESSION:
1.  Postsurgical changes with note of pneumobilia.
2.  Dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels, which is
concerning for small bowel obstruction, possibly.  This would be
better characterized with CT scan.
.
EKG [**8-7**]:  NSR at 75 bpm, Q waves in the inferolateral leads
suggestive of old inferolateral MI, unchanged.  ? T wave
flattening in lateral leads, likely related to globally
decreased amplitude when compared to prior. Otherwise, no
diagnostic change.
.
CT chest/abd/pelvis - [**2113-8-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Mechanical small bowel obstruction involving the stomach,
afferent loop leading from the hepaticojejunostomy, and the
proximal small bowel with a transition point in the right mid
abdomen, and new pneumobilia, likely related to the small bowel
obstruction.
2) Essentially unchanged bulky lymphadenopathy in the
periportal, periaortic, and mesenteric regions.
3) Decreased conspicuity of multiple hepatic metastatic foci.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo M with h/o metastatic pancreatic cancer (dx [**2113-1-2**]) s/p
Whipple procedure, COPD, and HTN who presented with N/V and
abdominal pain after discharge on [**8-10**] s/p treatment of SBO
admitted for management of DKA and continued decreased PO intake
at home. He was admitted and transfered twice to the ICU early
in his course.  He changed his code status to DNR/DNI after the
second unit transfer.  He was not transfered out of the hospital
due to inability to find placement that the family was ammenable
to.
.
The patient died comfortably in the hospital on [**2113-9-4**].
.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1) DKA:  Anion gap elevated at 21 on transfer, ketones in the
urine.  Unclear as to exactly what precipitant had been. In
terms of etiology, cultures sent, CXR obtained, though patient
without localizing signs of infection and WBC actually lower
than usual, afebrile.  Family reports that patient had missed at
least one dose of home glargine PTA. The pt was started on an
Insulin drip at 2 U / hour initially (glucose 150 on arrival to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**]) with D51/2NS 1L over 2 hours. Once the patient's anion gap
had closed the the insulin drip was stopped and sc insulin was
started. Patient has had minimal po intake so home dose of
glargine was decreased to 6U and patient was maintained on
regular insulin sliding scale for glucose control. Electrolytes
were repleted accordingly. Anion gap remained closed and
symptoms improved over course of admission.  Patient was
transferred out of the unit when AG had closed.  On the floor pt
continued to have hiccups and was started on decadron.  2 days
later morning labs showed AG of 30 he was again given IVF, and
insulin.  His AG closed to 18, however was transferred to ICU
for insulin drip.  After stay in ICU for 1 day he returned to
the floor with AG of 15.  His Lantus was changed to 12 units QAM
and he was continued on HISS.  Chemistries were checked twice a
day and AG remained stable.  The patient's code status was
changed to DNR/DNI and labs were no longer drawn on the floor
with the exception of fingersticks.  Because the pt could
tolerate less and less oral intake due to painful hiccoughs, his
BG remained low and insulin was cut back.  Fingersticks were
reduced to 4 times per day over time.  They remained low even as
insulin glargine was cut back to 4units qam.  The insulin was
stopped and fingersticks were cut back to qday as the patient's
status declined.
.
2) N/V/Abdominal Pain:  Likely related to DKA in part, however
patient with extensive intra-abdominal procedures and recent
hospitalization for small bowel obstruction (SBO).  For now,
abdomen doesn't appear surgical, and AXR demonstrates some
improvement in bowel distention although still evidence of
dilated loops of small bowel.  Patient has been passing flatus
but was not moving bowels during his stay in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Serial
abdominal exams did not reveal any
