CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2154-4-22**] 6:28 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Eval. for CHF

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old woman with pancreatic ca with resp distress
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Eval. for CHF
INDICATION: 64-year-old female with pancreatic carcinoma,
respiratory distress.

COMPARISON: [**2154-4-21**].

UPRIGHT CHEST: The tip of a right internal jugular venous
catheter terminates in the distal SVC. There is prior abdominal
surgery with a drain identified projecting over the right upper
quadrant. The tip of a nasogastric tube terminates in the distal
esophagus. The heart size is top normal, and the mediastinal and
hilar contours are stable. There is continued opacification of
the left lower lobe with air bronchograms and layering small
pleural effusion. Mild linear atelectasis is seen at the right
base. The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. No
pneumothorax is identified.

IMPRESSION: Nasogastric tube malpositioned in the distal
esophagus. Left lower lobe consolidation, representing a
combination of atelectasis and/or effusion. Pneumonia could be
considered in the right clinical circumstance. No pneumothorax.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: eval for PE
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old woman with dyspnea and tachycardia and resp distress

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Dyspnea, tachycardia, respiratory distress.

COMPARISONS: None.

TECHNIQUE: CT angiogram of the chest was performed. Axial MDCT
images were obtained through the lungs before and after
administration of nonionic Optiray contrast.

CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of
pulmonary embolism. There are moderate sized bilateral pleural
effusions, right greater than left with associated collapse of
the lower lobes bilaterally. There are scattered ground-glass
opacities within the lungs, predominantly in a perihilar
distribution. The main pulmonary is enlarged measuring 3.2 cm.
There are non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal nodes with no
pathologic lymphadenopathy. Within the anterior mediastinum,
inferior to the thymic bed, there is a 2.1 x 0.9 cm soft tissue
attenuation mass. This mass is immediately posterior to the
internal mammary vessels on the left side of the anterior
mediastinum and is well circumscribed.

Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions with reactive atelectasis.
3. Scattered ground-glass opacities in a perihilar distribution.
These finding are nonspecific, but likely represents pulmonary
edema.
4. 2 cm soft tissue mass in the left anterior mediastinum
posterior to the internal mammary vessels, of undetermined cause
or significance. Correlate clinically to determine nee4ed for
further evaluation which include short term follow up CT or MR
scan versus PET CTscan

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size.
Moderate-severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT
gradient. No
LV mass/thrombus. False LV tendon (normal variant).

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
mid anterior -
hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo; mid
anterolateral -
hypo; anterior apex - akinetic; septal apex- akinetic; lateral
apex -
akinetic; apex - akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Borderline normal RV
systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR. No

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate to severe regional
left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include hypokinesis
of the mid

regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve
