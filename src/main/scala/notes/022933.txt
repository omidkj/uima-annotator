Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. All four pulmonary veins identified and
enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Severely dilated LV cavity.
Severely depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Moderately dilated
ascending aorta. Moderately dilated descending aorta Simple
atheroma in descending aorta. No 2D or Doppler evidence of
distal arch coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Mildly thickened aortic
valve leaflets. Aortic leaflet prolapse. No AS. Severe (4+) AR.
Eccentric AR jet directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild MVP.
Mitral leaflets fail to fully coapt. Mild mitral annular
calcification. Eccentric MR jet. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Suboptimal image
quality. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mils symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30
%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There is a section of the
descending thoracic aorta, just distal to the aortic arch that
appears moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta and the aortic arch.
5. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Severe (4+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
mitral valvular prolapse. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet
of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no evidence of PDA or coarctation.

POST-BYPASS:
Patient removed from cardiopulmonary bypass on a phenylephrine
infusion.
1. There is a bioprosthetic aortic valve that is well seated
with no evidence of paravalvular leak or valvular aortic
regurgitation. Mean gradient across the valve is 8.6mmHg with a
maximum around 20 mm Hg.
2. Biventricular function is unchanged with LVEF 25-30%.
3. Degree of mitral regurgitation is also unchanged.
4. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation.
5. The ascending aortic graft can not be visualized.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on [**1-4**] where he underwent
an AVR & replacement of ascending aorta. He was transferred to
the ICU in stable condition. He was taken back to the operating
room later that same day for bleeding and was found to have
chest wall bleeding. He was returned to the ICU. He was
extubated on POD #1. He was transferred to the floor on POD #2.
He was noted to have an air leak on his left pleural chest tube;
it was left in while his meiastinal tubes were removed.  It was
placed to water seal on POD # 3, but he had a pneumothorax on
CXR.  The tube was again placed to water seal on POD # 4, CXR
revealed a left apical ptx. This remained, but the airleak
resolved.  The tube was ultimately removed on POD #6 when the
airleak resolved.  Repeat CXR showed slight increase in ptx.  He
remained in the hospital another day.  Repeat CXR showed
decrease in left apical ptx., he has remained hemodynamically
stable, and is ready to be discharged home.
