Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status, septic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 73yo male with PMH of chronic systolic CHF (EF 25%), s/p
dual chanmber pacer/[**First Name3 (LF) 3941**] implantation for a-fib with tachy-brady
syndrome, DM2 not on insulin, HTN, who was BIBEMS for altered
mental status. The patient reports that he simply felt weak and
"off balance." He states these symptoms have been going on for
some time (weeks). He denies any vertigo or diplopia. No fevers
but endorses some chills and myalgias. No chest pain or
palpitations. He endorses a new cough and a dry itchy throat, as
well as congestion. He does have a positive sick contact in that
his wife has "a cold." He has had a somewhat depressed appetite
and did vomit his food earlier today. No abdominal pain or
diarrhea. He denies dysuria prior to having a Foley placed in
the ED.
.
In the ED initial VS were 102.4 105 126/59 23 97% 2L. FSG was in
the 30s. He received 1 amp D50 and looked better, with sugars up
to 100s. Once euglyemic, he had no complaints and was very
interactive. Initial labs revealed elevated lactate to 8.1, with
AG was elevated at 21. A sepsis CVL was placed and infectious
workup was initiated, which revealed no leukocytosis or
bandemia. He had a clean U/A and a CXR which showed patchy
opacities within both lung bases. Blood and urine cultures were
sent and he received vanc/zosyn. His glucose again dropped to 21
for which he received another amp of D50 and was started on a D5
gtt. Despite this he remained hypoglycemic in the 30s and
received additional amp of D50 prior to ICU admission. A repeat
lactate after 3L IVF was 4.4 --> 3.3. A CVP was not transduced.
SvO2 monitoring revealed central venous O2 sats in mid 50's, but
dobutamine not started given concern for promoting tachycardia.
Most recent vitals prior to ICU transfer 107 122/86 20 99% 6L
NC.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 73 yoM with h/o CAD, systolic CHF (EF 20%), s/p
pacer and [**Month/Day/Year 3941**], presents with fever, hypoglycemia, possible
sepsis.
.
#. Shock, possibly septic - evidence of hypoperfusion with
lactate peak in ED of 8.1, improving to 4.1-->3.3 with fluids.
Unclear etiology but most likely source at this point appears
pulmonary, either viral or bacterial. The patient was managed on
broad spectrum antibiotics, but did not improve, requiring
escalating support, until the decision for CMO status. Care was
withdrawn at the direction of his HCP and family in a meeting
with the ICU team and he was placed on a morphine drip.
.
# Hypoglycemia - likely from ongoing sepsis, but contributions
from medication effect and poor hepatic/renal clearance of oral
hypoglycemics vs. impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis are also
possible.
.
#. CAD s/p MI: No evidence of ischemia on EKG. One set of
enzymes were negative int he ED but pt never complained of any
chest pain.
.
#. chronic systolic CHF: did not appear to be in florid
decompensated CHF at this time. He reported only mild SOB, and
CXR did not reveal evidence of pulmonary edema. All
antihypertensives were held.
.
#. A-fib. Pt was rate controlled with metoprolol and
anti-coagulated on coumadin prior to admission. Pt also has a
pacer for tachy/brady. Monitored on telemetry.
.
# Microcytic Anemia: severely microcytic with MCV 68, with 62
nRBCs on diff. Recent Fe studies did not reveal iron deficiency.
On that admission there was also no evidence of hemolysis.
.
# Elevated LFTs: The patient has had chronically elevated LFTs
and currently they are not significantly changed from prior.
Felt likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy versus
medication induced (was on amiodarone until recently)
.
#. CRI - baseline Cr 1.1-1.5: Pt with Cr 1.4 on admission.
