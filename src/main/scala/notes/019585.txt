Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, cardiogenic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

cardiac catheterization and IABP placement ([**2112-3-4**])

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 77 year old male with PMHx significant for
recurrent espohageal adeno carcinoma who appeared to go into
cardiogenic shock after having L main bronchus stent placed.
Patient with known esophageal CA s/p resection in [**4-/2108**] with
recurrence in [**2110**] s/p chemotherapy (last [**2112-2-4**]) who has been
having increased shortness of breath for the past 2 months.
Patient intially felt to have bronchitis and treated with
antibiotics without improvement of symptoms.  He underwent
biopsy of L main bronchus which showed espohageal adenocarcinoma
along the wall.  One day PTA patient CXR showed opacification of
L chest and had bronch on [**2112-3-3**] which showed LMS obstruction.

Pertinent Results:
Bedside TTE ([**2112-3-4**]):
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed with septal, anterior
and apical akinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere. The right
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
.
Cardiac cath ([**2112-3-4**]):
Bronchoscopy w/ biopsy ([**2112-3-4**]):

[**2112-3-8**]: ECHO: Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate
regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the septum
and apex (EF
40-45%). The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are three
moderately
thickened aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small pericardial
effusion, without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2112-3-4**] pt was taken to the OR for rigid bronchoscopy,
flexible bronchoscopy, micro-debridement, metallic-covered stent
placement 14 x 40. Patient tolerated procedure well and was sent
to PACU. In the PACU patient became hypertensive and tachycardic
to 120s with LBBB pattern. Pt O2Sat dropped to 70-80s and he was
intubated. A CXR was obtained which was consistent with b/l
pulmonary edema. Patient was given 40 IV lasix with minimal
response. An emergent TTE was done which showed severe LV
systolic dysfunction with LVEF < 20%, no tamponade, perserved RV
systolic function. Swan was placed and hemodynamics showed PAP
45/30 Ci 1.1 CO 1.5-2.0 and SVO2 55-60. Patient given ASA and
started on epinephrine infusion. He was sent to the cath lab
where it was revealed that he had clean coronaries. A IABP was
placed and pt sent to CCU team.
The patient was admitted to the CCU team post-cath and a femoral
a-line was placed by the fellow.  He was maintained on
norepinephrine and dobutamine drips overnight to maintain his BP
in the setting of his cardiogenic shock.  The FiO2 on his vent
was initially weaned down slightly, though he was intially
unable to tolerate anything lower than an FiO2 of 70%.
Overnight between hospital days 1 and 2, he became acutely
tachycardic to the 140s with a stable BP and a moderate drop in
his cardiac index.  ECGs were suggestive of atrial tachycardia
and he was electricallu cardioverted on the morning of hospital
day #2 under the supervision of the cardiology attending.
On HD#3 he was bronched and found to have malignant airway
obstruction s/p stent placement for post-obstructive PNA. He was
maintained on broad spectrum IVAB. Hemodynamics stabilized ,
pressors and IABP were weaned, he was diuresed and then
extubated successfully. repaet echo was done which showed
improved EF 40-45%. On HD#4 pt was transfferred from the ICU to
the floor. He continued to do well was to complete a 14 day
course of broad spectrum po antibiotics and was d/c'd to home w/
VNA services on HD#6.
