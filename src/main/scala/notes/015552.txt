Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
The patient is 68 y/o M w/hx of CAD s/p MI in [**2186**], HTN,
hyperlipidemia who is transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for STEMI. Pt
was first admitted on [**2195-1-14**] and underwent L3-L5 laminectomy,
fusion, foraminotmy, and durotomy with bone autograft.
Posteroperatively, the patient developed chest pain, which was
treated with IV NTGL, morphine, and metoprolol. The patient was
treated with these conservative measures, and given resolution
of chest pain and contraindication of anticoagulation, cardiac
catheterization was deffered. Cardiac markers were cycled, and
CK peaked on [**2195-1-15**] at 5021, trop 70, and has trended down
since. He has remained chest pain free since.
On [**2195-1-16**], the patient went into atrial fibrillation with a
rapid ventricular response of 144, and the patient was
transfered to the NEBH CCU. IV lopressor was administered,
without effect. The patient was started on a diltiazem gtt, with
improvement of HR control to 90s-120s. The patient remained
asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable throughout. He was
managed with a dilt gtt, PO lopressor and amioderone. At that
time, heparin gtt was also started. The patient converted to
sinus rhythm, and the dilt gtt was stopped. On the morning of
transfer, the patient went back into afib again with HRs in the
140 and Dilt gtt was restarted. Lopressor increased to 200mg PO
BID and amio to 400mg PO BID. Pt was reportedly noted to have
long pauses and ? of new LBBB, and had transvenous pacer wire
placed on [**2195-1-16**].
On the night prior to transfer, the patient spiked temp to
101.6, despite RTC tylenol. CXR was obtained and UA and culture
was taken. Despite a normal WBC on admission, the patient has
had a leukocytosis since [**1-14**] of 26.5. He has not received
antibiotics and no blood cultures were drawn.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

.
Imaging/Stdies:
.
Echo [**1-17**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half
of the anterior septum and anterior walls. The apex is akinetic
and mildly aneurysmal. The remaining segments contract well
(LVEF= 35-40 %). No thrombus is seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild [1+] mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is high normal. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution).
Mild mitral regurgitation.
