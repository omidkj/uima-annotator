chest pain

cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 931**] is a 78 year-old woman with h/o HTN, hyperchol,
CHF, ESRD (not yet on HD) who was transfered from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 2538**] for management of NSTEMI.
.
The patient describes 2 types of pain. The first pain is a R
sternal pain that occurs while eating and is usually relieved
with physical massage. She reports having this pain for years.
.
The second type of pain started 2 days ago, but has not recurred
now for more than 24 hours.   She reports having epigastric
chest pain 2 days prior to admission that lasted for a whole
day.  She also noted pain in her R arm at the same time.  Denies
associated N/V, diaphoresis, or sob.  No recent change in
weight, LE swelling, or PND. Patient did have some mild cough
with yellow productive sputum, but no f/c.  She also c/o chronic
lightheadedness that she attributes to her medication along with
some intermittent vertigo. Patient otherwise denies any
myalgias/arthralgias. She continues to urinate, no
dysuria/hematuria, intermittent constipation.  She also has
chronic insominia.  Her exercise capacity consists of [**12-14**] a
block, limited by fatigue. Patient told her daughter about the
pain, who then contact[**Name (NI) **] patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2539**].  PCP referred
the patient to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED for evaluation.
.
Upon arrival to the OSH ED, labs revealed Cr 2.7; CK 301; CKMB
59; Trop T 1.46; EKG was unchanged.  Elevated cardiac enzymes
were confirmed with CK of 317, troponin 1.68 with no prior
baseline.  She was started on a heparin gtt, ASA 325, Lopressor
5 mg IV x 1.  Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
managment.
.
Currently, patient feels well, denies CP/SOB.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2152-3-17**] (PRELIMINARY REPORT)
1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed two vessel coronary
artery disease.  The left main coronary artery was short with no
angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.  The LAD had
moderate diffuse disease with a 70% stenosis in the mid vessel
and a 70% stenosis at the origin of the first diagonal.  The LCX
had an OM1 upper pole with a 99% stenosis and slow flow.  The
LCX had a 70% stenosis in the mid vessel.  The RCA was small in
caliber and had no angiographically apparent flow limiting
stenoses.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics were performed upon entry.
Systemic arterial pressure was moderately elevated (aortic
pressure was 160/73mmHg).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
.
CT ABDOMEN [**2152-3-17**] (PRELIMINARY REPORT)
1. Small hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusion.
3. No evidence of reteroperitoneal bleed.
4. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease.
5. Atrophic kidneys. Not significantly changed form CT from [**4-14**], [**2148**].
.
ECHO [**2152-3-17**]
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function
appears depressed with lateral hypokinesis (regional wall motion
not fully assessed). Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
CXR [**2152-3-20**]: (PRELIMINARY REPORT)
2 views of the chest compared to a single view done 4 days
earlier. There are no focal infiltrates or definite effusions.
Mediastinum and bony structures are unchanged including findings
consistent with rotator cuff disease involving the right
shoulder. There is also marked aortic tortuosity and prominence,
this is also unchanged. Over the cervical prevertebral area,
there is a superimposed air which likely represents the trachea
as well as the piriform sinuses. Please correlate clinically in
this patient with fever.
.
CT chest (non-contrast): 1. Extensive aortic and coronary
atherosclerosis with suspected descending thoracic aorta
dissection and intraluminal thrombus, stable. This study is not
dedicated to evaluation of the vascular system and additional
examination might be considered.

2. Right lower lobe atelectasis and small pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 931**] is a 78 year-old woman with a history of
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure,
end stage renal disease (not yet on hemodialysis) who was
transfered from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital3 628**] for management of NSTEMI.
.
# NSTEMI: The patient was diagnosed with a non-ST elevation MI
at the outside hospital. She underwent cardiac catheterization
on [**2152-3-17**] showing 2 vessel disease(LAD 70%, D1 70%; LCx 70%, OM1
99%).  During cath, the cardiologists were unable to cross the
LCx/OM1 lesion with the wire.  CT surgery was called for
evaluation of possible surgical revascularization given the
inability to perform PCI.  Plavix was held given this
consideration of surgical revascularization in the future.  She
was continued on aspirin and statin.  The patient was not on a
betablocker as an outpatient; however, this was not started
initially after cath due to hypotension (see below). Her
hypotension resolved, and a beta blocker was started.  Because
of ongoing fevers and clinical pneumonia, CABG was deferred and
the pt was discharged home with instructions to follow-up with
CT surgery for CABG in several weeks.
.
# HYPOTENSION:  Approximately 2 hours after catheterization, the
patient was noted to h
