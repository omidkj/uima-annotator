Chief Complaint:
diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
87F with PMH significant for HTN, hypercholesterolemia, s/p
recent repair of R ankle fracture at OSH presents with diarrhea
x 5 weeks. The pt was in her USOH when she fell off a ladder 6
weeks ago and was hospitalized for R ankle fracture. Per her
daughter, she was placed on antibiotics during this
hospitalization. Was subsequently transferred to a rehab
facility. The pt reports the diarrhea started while she was
still at the OSH. Describes the diarrhea as being mostly loose,
occasionally mucousy, non-bloody. The diarrhea has also been
accompanied by abdominal pain that is described as a bloating
and occasionally cramping sensation. Denies relief of abdominal
pain with bowel mvmts. She reports the diarrhea has increased in
frequency over the past week, now has approximately [**4-16**] bowel
mvmts/day. No sick contacts or recent travel. No recent
consumption of any out of the ordinary foods. The pt also
reports reduced PO intake with occasional lightheadedness as
well as subjective fevers. Reports losing between [**9-22**] lbs over
the past 2 months. She felt slightly nauseous today without any
episodes of emesis. Feels that the medications are making her
"stomach worse."
.
Initally in the ED, T 100.1, HR 76, BP 106/62, RR 18, sating
well on RA. The patient then became hypotensive in the 90's and
improved to 130/50 with 3L of fluids. Lactate was 0.9. WBC
elevated with left shift. Given tylenol X 1 for a fever of of
101, anzemet 12 IV X 1, and K repleted. She was admitted to
medicine for further evaluation of her diarrhea.

Pertinent Results:
Stool cx [**10-26**] - c. diff positive
.
R ankle x-ray [**10-25**] - Three views of the right ankle were
obtained without previous radiographs available for comparison.
Bimalleolar fractures present with lateral buttress plate with
cortical screws aligning distal fibular fracture located 3.5 cm
proximal to the tibial plafond.  Two obliquely oriented screws
transfix the fracture through the medial malleolus.  Multiple
small ossific densities are located adjacent to the medial
malleolar fracture.  Fracture lines are well visualized.  Talar
dome and ankle mortise preserved.
.
CXR [**10-25**] - Heart size is within normal limits.  The
aorta is mildly tortuous.  Lungs are grossly clear.  No definite
pleural
effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  There
is mild left apical thickening.  There is a focal eventration of
the right hemidiaphragm.  Pulmonary vasculature does not appear
engorged.  There is diffuse osteopenia.
.
KUB [**10-28**] - Supine and upright abdominal films were obtained.
The right
lateral aspect of the abdomen is not visualized on the supine
film obtained. There is apparent thickening of the colon in the
left lower quadrant with associated thumbprinting.  There is no
evidence of toxic megacolon.  There are mildly dilated
air-filled loops of small bowel in the left upper quadrant.
There are no definitive air-fluid levels.  There is no evidence
of air beneath the diaphragms.  There are degenerative changes
of the lumbar spine.
.
CTA CHEST [**11-7**] -
1.  Multiple left-sided pulmonary emboli.
2.  Moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions with evidence of
congestive
heart failure.
3.  Questionable wedge-shaped perfusion abnormalities in the
spleen.  Findings could be completely related to early arterial
phase timing, but splenic infarcts cannot be excluded.  This
could be further assessed with ultrasound.
4.  Hiatal hernia.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 87 F c HTN, hypercholesterolemia, s/p recent repair of R
ankle fracture presents with diarrhea x 5 weeks with stool
culture positive for c. diff.
.
1) Colitis:  Patient presented with leukocytosis, and stool on
admission positive for c diff toxin.  She was initiated on
empiric flagyl at time of admission and was later started also
on oral vancomycin due to flagyl non-response.  Her treatment
was complicated by two urinary tract infections, one with
pan-sensitive pseudomonas, and one with proteus. She was treated
with ciprofloxacin and tmp/smx, respectively.  Last antibiotic
dose was administered on [**11-15**].  At discharge, she will require
completion of a 4 week taper of vancomycin, starting from this
date when she was finally off other antibiotics.  She did have
several negative c. diff toxins stool studies prior to
discharge; however, she is considered to be at risk for
recurrence.
.
2) Hypotension: Ms [**Known lastname 70173**] was had several bouts of
hypotension following her initial admission to the medicine
service, which responded to fluid resuscitation.  On [**11-5**], she
was transferred to the ICU with hypotension, SBP's in the 70's
and no response to multiple fluid boluses.  Additionally, she
was in Afib with RVR (rate of 120).  Despite prophylaxis with
Lovenox, a PE was considered in the differential on transfer,
and she was subsequently found to have multiple pulmonary emboli
on CT scan.  She was aggressively fluid recussitated with bolus
IVF, and a right external jugular line was placed for fluid
recussitation with considerable difficulty. When she was
hemodynamically stabilized she was started on an esmolol drip
and then converted to po metoprolol (12.5 po tid) to rate
control her. She converted back into sinus rhythm. Her BP was
subsequently in the 100's with HR in the 80's.
.
3) Paroxysmal Afib - She was in atrial fibrillation with RVR
episodically following admission and ultimately on ICU transfer.
In the setting of associated hypotension, beta blockers were
held. When her hypotension resolved she was started on an
esmolol drip which was then converted to metoprolol 12.5 po tid.
 With a few episodes of Afib, she eventually reverted into sinus
rhythm and remained as such for the duration of her hospital
course. She was not a candidate for anticoagulation due to her
GI bleed.
.
4)Pulmonary embolus: She was found on transfer to the ICU to
have PE in proximal left lower lobe arterial branch extending to
multiple segmental branches. She had an ecchocardiogram which
did not reveal RV strain. She was tried on IV heparin twice with
grossly bloody stools; therefore anticoagulation was
discontinued and an IVC filter was placed without difficulty.
She was continued on prophylactic subcutaneous heparin, as she
has been bed-ridden.  Would plan to discontinue this
prophylactic measure once her ambulatory status is improved.
.
5) Recurrent UTI:  Urine culture from [**10-31**] grew pan-sensitive
pseudomonas, and she was treated subsequently with 3 days of
ciprofloxacin.  Urine culture from [**11-6**] grew pseudomonas, and
she was subsequently treated with 6 days of bactrim for
complicted UTI as foley was in place at this time.  She has
heightened risk of UtI given liquid stools and skin breakdown in
the perianal area.
.
6) Hematochezia: Ms. [**Known lastname 70173**] developed grossly bloody diarrhea
immediately following initiation of heparin for anti-coagulation
in the setting of new pulmonary embolus.  She required 1U pRBCs
in the ICU with a hematocrit that slowly trended downward.  She
refused colonoscopy while in the ICU and continued to refuse on
the medicine floor.  However, in the
