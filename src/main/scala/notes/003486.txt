Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 71 yo man with h/o IPF, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
who presents with one week history of worsening SOB.  Per the
patient and his family, his symptoms began last Tuesday when he
developed a sore lesion on the right side of his buttock.  He
was seen by his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] started him on Cefalexin for possible
bacterial infection.  Shortly thereafter, as he was unable to
take deep breaths secondary to the pain from this lesion, he
began to experience increased shortness of breath and a
non-productive cough.  Over the past few days, he has had
increased dizziness and his O2 sats dropped to the low 70s and
high 60s (baseline in the 80s on 2L O2 at home).  Yesterday, he
had a low-grade fever of 100.2 and an episode of fecal
incontinence. Per the patient, he has also been experiencing a
"tingling" sensation in his legs for the past three days, and he
had an associated mechanical fall last night while walking to
the kitchen.  Given concerns over these events, the patient's
wife and daughter brought him to the [**Name (NI) **] this morning.
.
Of note, the patient was diagnosed with IPF in [**2100-12-26**].
He had biopsies performed at [**Hospital1 2177**] and is currently followed by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Per the patient, he has had a significant clinical
decline since this time and was most recently hospitalized at
[**Hospital3 3583**] in [**2101-1-23**] for PNA.
.
In the ED, his VS were T 98.2, P 109, BP 118/65, R 20, O2 87% on
3L.  He was had 3 word dyspnea and was placed on 4L, and his O2
sat increased to 91-92%.  CXR showed new area of opacity in LUL,
so he was started on Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin for CAP.
.
On the floor, the patient continues to complain of increased SOB
and tingling in his legs.  He admits to increased lower back and
abdominal pain, as well as difficulty swallowing for the past
three days.  Finally, he states that he has had increased
urinary retension over the past week.

CXR ([**7-17**]): Worsening interstitial opacities, more confluent in
the LUL.
Although these changes may be related to worsening nterstitial
lung disease, a superimposed pneumonia in the left upper lobe
cannot be excluded.

CT Chest ([**7-17**]): 1. No evidence of central, lobar or segmental
pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.  2. Moderately
progressive worsening of pulmonary fibrosis without focal
consolidations.

MRI L-Spine ([**7-18**]): 1. Enhancement of the cauda equina extending
from L3 to L5 consistent with arachnoiditis.  2. No evidence of
cauda equina or spinal cord compression.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 71 yo man with IPF, who presents with a
one-week history of worsening hypoxia and found to have zoster
of S2-S3 and lumbar arachnoiditis (likely [**12-27**] VZV) causing
weakness in hip flexion bilaterally.
.
#. Ideopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis:  The patient has a h/o IPF,
which was diagnosed 6 months ago.  He was seen by pulmonary as
an inpatient who felt his shortness of breath to likely be an
IPF exaxerbation, but also considered superimposed PNA or viral
infection.  He has had increasing hypoxia over the past week,
with recent ABG of 7.51/36/60/30.  He is currently taking
Prednisone, Acetylcystine, and Azathioprine and his prednisone
was increased to 60 mg [**Hospital1 **], but will be tapered down to 40 mg
daily over a 3 week course.  CXR showed new LUL infiltrate for
which he was started on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, later
narrowed to levofloxacin.  He has significant desats on even
mild exertion to the mid to high 70s.  During his time in the
hospital, his O2 sats improved.  Upon admission, he desatted to
the low 70's when he stood up.  Now, he can take 10 steps before
having to rest, and his sats stay in the low 80s.  His new O2
requirement is, however, higher than before.  He reports using
2L at rest and 3L with activity, and now it appears he needs
4-5L at rest.  He will still be continued on his Mucomyst,
Azathioprine, and Prednisone, and Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
He finished his course of Levo in the hospital, and will require
2 more week of Acyclovir PO after being discharged.  His current
respiratory status is much improved from admission and likely
represents his new baseline.
.
# Zoster:  The patient developed an ulcerated lesion in his
coccyx several days before presenting to the hospital.  It
developed into an expanding rash in the S2,S3 dermatomal
distribution early in his hospital stay.  He was seen by Derm
and ID who swabbed the rash and determined it to be Zoster. He
was started on a 10 day course of IV Acyclovir, the last day of
which is [**7-29**].  The rash is only minimally painful now and much
improved from the first few days after it developed when the
patient described [**9-3**] pain.
.
# Arachnoiditis - Likely cause for fecal incontinence and BLE
weakness.  CSF labs are consistent with viral etiology as there
was an elevated WBC with a predominance of lymphocyte with
elevated protein and normal glucose; varicella PCR came back
positive, HSV PCR pending.  Varicella zoster is likely etiology
given the patient's current active dermatologic manifestation
and presence of immunosuppression.  He was initially on
ceftriaxone, ampicillin but bacterial cultures were negative. He
was started on a 10 day course of IV Acyc
