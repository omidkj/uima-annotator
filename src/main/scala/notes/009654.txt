Shortness of Breath

none


History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is a 62 year-old female with PMH significant
for CAD s/p DES to LAD, severe diastolic CHF, pulmonary HTN,
DM2, morbid obesity, and PVD with recent admissions for
exacerbations of her pulmonary disease who presents with 3-4
days increased dyspnea at rest and on exertion and fatigue. She
describes the feeling of SOB occurring gradually over this time
with associated fatigue and dry cough. She also reports
increased swelling in the legs and perhaps an 8 lb weight gain.
She has been adherent with her medications to include torsemide
which was recently switched back to lasix. However, she notes no
change in her chronic 02 requirement (3-4L NC), no change in
orthopnea, PND, and denies f/c, HA, chest pain, nausea,
sweating, abd pain, diarrhea or leg pain. No recent travel or
sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] change in her diet.
.
In the ED, T 97.4, RR 20, 02 100% on 3L. CXR performed. Pt
became tachycardic to 120s and EKG demonstrated afib with RVR.
She was given Dilt 30mg IV with resolution of her tachycardia.
She was also given ASA 325mg, Solumedrol 125mg IV, and ativan
.
On arrival to the floor, she is fatigued but feels overall well.



Past Medical History:
Cardiac:
1. CAD s/p stent RCA in [**2100**], 2 Cypher stents to LAD in [**2102**];
NSTEMI in [**8-2**] -> cath then showed
2. PVD s/p bilateral fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] in 96
3. HTN
4. Afib noted on admission in [**9-2**] - reverted to sinus and seen
by cards who felt she did not need anticoagulation
5. Dyslipidemia
6. Syncope/Presyncopal episodes - This was evaluated as an
inpaitent in [**9-2**] and as an opt with a KOH. No etiology has been
found as of yet. One thought was that these episodes are her
falling asleep since she has a h/o of OSA. She has had no tele
changes in the past when she has had these episodes.

1. Severe Pulmonary HTN
2. Asthma or COPD (notes say both)
3. OSA- CPAP at home 14 cm of water and 4 liters of oxygen
4. Restrictive lung disease

Other:
1. Morbid obesity (BMI 54)
2. Type 2 DM on insulin - last A1C is 8.9 in [**10-3**]

years

Pertinent Results:
   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2105-4-1**] 6:28 PM

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2105-4-1**] 10:25 AM

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2-13**] and
[**4-1**]:

Overlying soft tissue probably lends some increasing
radiodensity to the right mid and lower lung but the area is
still suspicious for new consolidation, though unfortunately
motion artifact on the lateral film makes confirmation
impossible. If the patient can tolerate a repeat lateral, I
would obtain that as well as routine oblique views in hopes of
clarifying the status of the lower lobes. Pulmonary vascular
engorgement is longstanding even though heart size is only
mildly enlarged. There is no pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (BOTH OBLIQUES ONLY)  [**2105-4-1**] 6:03 PM

IMPRESSION:

Diffuse pulmonary opacification unchanged since [**Month (only) 404**], could
be due to hypersensitivity pneumonitis or other extensive
alveolitis.

No evidence of bacterial pneumonia.

Calcified right upper lobe granuloma.

ECHO [**2105-4-2**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-2-17**],
pulmonary artery pressure could not be determined in the current
study.

COURSE:
Pt. was initially admitted to the general medical floor.
Throughout HD1 she continued to have elevated blood sugars -
despite aggressive subcutaneous insulin administration.  She was
transferred to the ICU the evening of HD1 because of a need for
an insulin drip.  Also, during HD1 the patient was evaluated by
the [**Last Name (un) **] team, pulmonary consult, and cardiology consult
teams.
.
She spent the following two days in the ICU as she was
eventually transitioned back to her home dose of insulin - which
included Symlin - a medication she had brought in from home as
the [**Hospit
