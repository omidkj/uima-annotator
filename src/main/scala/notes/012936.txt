Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
85 yo F with h/o CAD s/p CABG, chronic CHF and recent bowel
surgery presents with hypotension now tx from [**Hospital1 882**] (orig
from [**Hospital **] rehab). Per [**Hospital 100**] rehab, BP has been low for several
days, now not responsive to fluids. She was found overnight to
systolics reportedly as low as 50s; ? still mentating.
Thereafter, she was transferred to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital where she
received 4L IVFs as well as IV zosyn. Patient was alert and
oriented x3, code status was discussed with patient who stated
DNR/DNI and that she doesnt want central line even if
lifesaving. This was confirmed with her niece who is HCP, who
states that her aunt discussed with her DNR and confirms. Thus,
she was started on levophed through right PICC (placed prior to
presentation, but unclear when) and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
for further management.
.
Of note, she has a hx of recent rectocolectomy for rectal perf
with small bowel prolapse (2 feet of bowel resected) at [**Hospital1 **] and has ostomy and choleostomy bag (placed for acalculus
cholecystitis). Post op course was complicated by wound
infection, pneumonia, c. diff and right hip cellulitis. She was
treated periop with levofloxacin, flagyl and keflex. Discharge
summary from [**Hospital3 **] recommends course of keflex to end on
[**12-2**], levofloxacin to end on [**12-4**] and flagyl to be continued
through [**12-9**]. Her transfer record only lists flagyl as
antibiotic so it is unclear whether she received full courses of
these meds.
.
In the ED here, initial vitals were T: 95.4 BP: 116/88 HR: 100
RR: 26 O2 sat: 100% (unclear amount supplemental O2). Labs were
notable for creatinine of 2.7 (CRI, but unclear baseline),
bicarb of 10, and initial venous pH of 7.08 which improved
slightly to 7.11 prior to transfer. Lactate was normal at 1.4.
Initial glucose drawn from her PICC was 546 however this was
thought d/t dextrose delivered through her PICC at [**Hospital3 **]
for hypoglycemia as repeats without intervention normalized.
Arterial line placement was attempted in ? left wrist (with
doppler) however pt extremely edemetous so attempt was
unsuccessful. UA was not sent. CXR demonstrated hiatal hernia,
cardiomegaly and inadequately characterized retrocardiac
opacity. CT abdomen/pelvis was obtained which demonstrated
transverse colon herniation into chest and small amount of free
fluid within pelvis and perisplenic; viability of tissue in
hernia could not be evaluated per radiology prelim read, however
surgery evaluated imaging and suspect source is most likely
intraabdominal, but patient adamantly refused surgical
intervention. She received 1g IV vanco and 500mg flagyl as well
as 25mcg fentanyl for back pain (it does not appear by
documentation that she received any additional IVFs) and is now
being admitted to the ICU for further management of hypotension.

.
Currently she reports generally feeling unwell, fatigued and
complains of extremely dry mouth. She endorses productive cough.
She denies significant SOB. She has no CP/palps. She endorses
low back pain which she says is chronic. She denies abdominal
pain and is unsure if her ostomy output has changed. She denies
dysuria or urinary urgency. She denies rashes. She denies focal
numbness, tingling, weakness (just marked generalized weakness).

[**2196-12-4**] CT abd/ pelvis without contrast: IMPRESSION:
1. A long segment of transverse colon herniates through a large
diaphragmatic defect into the chest. There is no pneumatosis,
although further evaluation of the bowel for ischemic changes is
limited without the use of contrast.
2. Small amount of pelvic free fluid. Without oral contrast, it
is difficult to differentiate free fluid from decompressed colon
and small bowel.
3. Suture line with small pocket of gas and fluid adjacent that
may be post- surgical (2:58).
4. The gallbladder is not well seen, which may be contracted
around the
drain.
.
[**2196-12-11**] CXR: The patient has a right-sided central line,
unchanged in position. Portable AP film is of suboptimal
quality. There is a degree of rotation also. The patient has
prominence of the right hilum, likely vascular. Cardiomegaly,
cardiac calcifications, and probable left retrocardiac
atelectasis is unchanged. There is a degree of respiratory
unsharpness on this radiograph also. No florid evidence of
pulmonary failure.
CONCLUSION
Little change from prior radiograph.

CAD s/p CABG and recent hospitalization for rectal perforation
and small bowel prolapse complicated by necrosis now s/p
rectocolectomy and percutaneous chole with course complicated by
pneumonia and C.diff transferred from OSH on [**12-4**] for septic
shock secondary to fungemia and bacteremia.

# Sepsis: Patient with blood cultures from [**12-4**] positive for
coag negative Staph and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] parapsilosis.  Also with
positive C.diff from OSH in prior week and possible
intraabdominal infectious process.
