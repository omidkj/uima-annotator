History of Present Illness:
HPI: 60 yo F who presented to an outside hospital with the worst
headache of her life.  Upon arrival there she was talking, but

Pertinent Results:
[**2147-10-12**] CT Head:
Diffuse basal SAH with IVH and interhemispheric SAH

[**2147-10-12**] CTA Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive multicompartmental intracranial hemorrhage as
described above
with mild diffuse cerebral edema, low lying cerebellar tonsils
and mass effect and mild obsturctive hydrocephalus, that needs
to be focussed on close followup. Details regarding interval
change as above. Slightly increased attenuation in the CSF in
the thecal sac at the level of C2, which may relate to
redistribution of the hemorrhage.

2. Multilobulated saccular aneurysm, from the anterior
communicating artery measuring 1.8x.15 cm, with a narrow neck of
approximately 3 mm.

CTA Head [**2147-10-13**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval coiling of the anterior communicating artery
aneurysm with blood visualized in the ventricles, and a right
frontal ventricular drain is seen.  The ventricular size remains
slightly enlarged but decreased from the previous CT of
[**2147-10-12**].

2. CTA of the head demonstrates slightly diminished density of
the flow in
the right A2 segment distal to the coiling which may be due to
diminished
flow. No definite defect identified in the distribution of right
anterior
cerebral artery.

OBJECT: R/O SZ,INPT Bedside LTM w/Video,EKG,[**Date range (1) 88198**].



REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]


FINDINGS:
CONTINUOUS EEG: The background was slow reaching a maximum 4 Hz
frequency. There were generalized bursts of right more than left
delta
slowing seen. There were also rare sharp discharges noted most
often
phase reversing at the F4 electrode. There were no clear
organized
discharges or electrographic seizures noted.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were many entries in these
files.
These represented mostly electrical and muscle artifact;
however, there
were very rare sharp discharges noted phase reversing at the F4
electrode.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were no entries in these
files.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no entries in these files.
SLEEP: There was no clear sleep architecture noted throughout
the
record.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the
presence
of a slow background and bursts of generalized slowing, which
indicate a
moderate to severe encephalopathy such as seen in diffuse
ischemia,
toxic/metablic processes, or infectious etiologies, among
others. The
presence of rare sharp discharges in the right frontal region
suggests
that cortex there may be epileptogenic, but there were no
electrographic
seizures noted.

Reason: r/o dvt



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   60 year old woman with sah
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   r/o dvt



Final Report
INDICATION: 60-year-old female with SAH, rule out DVT.

COMPARISON: No previous exam for comparison.

FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of
bilateral
common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and tibial veins.
There is
normal flow, compression and augmentation seen in all the
vessels.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 88200**]
Reason: left UE ultrasound r/o dvt



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   60 year old woman with sah
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   left UE ultrasound r/o dvt



Final Report
INDICATION: 60-year-old female with SAH, evaluate left arm for
DVT.

COMPARISON: No previous exam for comparison.

FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler images of the left IJ,
subclavian,
axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins were obtained.
The left
basilic vein which is a superficial vein does not compress and
does not
demonstrate vascular flow on color Doppler imaging.

Normal flow, compression, and augmentation is seen in the
remainder of the
veins of the left arm.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left arm.
Occlusive
thrombus is seen within the left basilic vein (which is a
superficial vein).

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

OBJECT: ROE, LTM WITH VIDEO, EKG, [**Date range (1) 88201**].


REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]


FINDINGS:
ROUTINE TIME SAMPLES OF CONTINUOUS EEG: Showed a slow,
disorganized
background that was of mixed frequencies, usually in the theta
and delta
frequency ranges, reaching a maximum of about 6 Hz at times.
There was
more prominent superimposed bifrontal delta slowing, nearly
continuous
at times, usually more prominent in the right frontal region.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: No true interictal epileptiform
discharges
were seen.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were four entries in these
files.
None represented true electrographic seizures. All were
artifactual in
nature.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none.
SLEEP: No clear state changes were seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: This video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton
activations. No electrographic seizures or interictal
epileptiform
discharges were seen. The background was slow and disorganized
throughout the recording suggestive of a moderate encephalopathy
such as
can be seen in diffuse ischemia, toxic/metabolic processes, or
medication effect, among other causes. More prominent and, at
times,
nearly continuous focal slowing in the bifrontal re
