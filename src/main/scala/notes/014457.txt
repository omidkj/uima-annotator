Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis

History of Present Illness:
61 year old male with GERD, SCLC dx'd [**8-/2180**] and metastatic to
the mediastinum and brain, s/p brain radiation and 4 cycles of
chemo and begun on thoracic radiation within the last week, who
has had an increasing pericardial effusion which was initially
noted on CT in [**Month (only) 359**] of this year.  The patient had an echo on
[**12-12**] that revealed a large pericardial effusion with possible
tamponade physiology. He was scheduled to come in for elective
pericardiocentesis today but awoke with much worse SOB, was BIBA
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. He went to the cath lab where 300ccc
serosanguinous fluid was drained from a loculated effusion.  He
tolerated the procedure well without complication and a
pericardial drain was placed for continued drainage. In the CCU,
he reports not being sure if he is feeling better given his
ongoing pain related to the procedure. Denies significant SOB or
dizziness.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.  Endorses mild pedal edema b/l for the
last few days.

Imaging / other studies:
TTE (prior to drainage):
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a large pericardial
effusion measruing 2.5cm around the apex and 2cm along the
lateral and distal third of the left ventricle. There is minimal
anterior to the right ventricle and right atrium. There is
significant, accentuated respiratory variation in
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, c/w impaired ventricular filling
and increased pericardial pressure/tamponade physiology.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-9-19**],
the effusion is larger with increased pericardial
pressure/tamponade now suggested. The heart rate is also now
greater.

TTE (s/p drainage):
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). with normal free wall
contractility. There is a trivial echodense pericardial
effusion, primarily around the RV apex.

IMPRESSION: No clinically-significant residual pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-12-12**],
pericardial effusion has been successfully drained.

TTE (1 day s/p drainage):
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a small
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. The
effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or
other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

IMPRESSION: poor echo windows. There is a small amount of
residual fluid seen. There is an echodense mass at the apex and
lateral wall of the left ventricle (see in particular image #8).
This is probably collapsed lung outside the pericardium rather
than echo dense material in the pericardium. No echo evidence of
tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-12-13**],
the previously seen pericardial fluid has been drained.

CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1) Findings compatible with interval development of
post-obstructive pneumonia and left lower lobe collapse.
2) Known mediastinal mass and right pulmonary nodule.


Brief Hospital Course:
61yo M with SCLC diagnosed in [**8-/2180**] c/b CNS and mediastinal
metastases with known prior pericardial effusion, presents with
increasing dyspnea, with pericardiocentesis prior to admission
to CCU.
