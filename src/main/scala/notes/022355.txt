CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 69-year-old male referred
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for an outpatient cardiac catheterization
secondary to a positive stress test.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 27060**] was referred for
a stress test after having abnormal preoperative EKGs prior
to this workup for rotator cuff surgery.  The patient did not
have chest pain or shortness of breath at that time.  The
stress test was done on [**2173-3-10**].  During that time, the
patient did have chest pain and the test was stopped due to
fatigue.  Nuclear imaging revealed moderate to severe
anteroapical ischemia with an ejection fraction of 54%.

The patient had a catheterization on [**2173-3-11**] at the
[**Hospital6 256**].  The final assessment
was occlusive LAD disease with left circumflex and right
coronary artery disease.  At that time, Cardiothoracic
Surgery was consulted.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  COPD.
2.  Diet-controlled diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Pericarditis.
5.  Carpal tunnel surgery in [**2163**].
6.  Back surgery in [**2140**].
7.  TURP in [**2164**].
8.  Hypertension.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin.
2.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Atorvostatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.
No murmurs detected.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Cool
feet.  Positive DP and PT bilaterally.  No edema.  No
varicosities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with the
preoperative diagnosis of coronary artery disease.  The
patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2173-3-12**] and had
a CABG times three.  The patient had a LIMA to the LAD, and a
saphenous vein graft to the OM and then to the PDA.  Surgery
was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7625**].  The patient
was transported to the CSRU in stable condition.

On postoperative day number one, the patient complained of
increased pain which was treated with morphine, Toradol, and
Dilaudid.  The patient had his Swan discontinued and was out
of bed and walking.

On postoperative day number two and three, the patient
continued to do well, although had several bouts of rapid
atrial fibrillation which responded to Amiodarone boluses and
Lopressor.  At that time, beta blockers and Lasix were
initiated.

On postoperative day number four, the patient's hematocrit
was 24.6 and was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
On postoperative day number five, the patient was transferred
to the cardiac floor.

On the floor, this patient continued to do well.  The
patient's physical therapy level quickly returned to a level
V.  The patient had numerous bouts of rapid atrial
fibrillation into the 150 and 180 range.  Electrophysiology
was consulted and recommended gentle diuresis and treatment
with Amiodarone in combination with beta blockers.

Throughout the patient's hospitalization stay, his atrial
fibrillation continued to be rapid in the 150-180 range
intermittently.  Electrophysiology concluded that the patient
was not a candidate for nodal ablation or pacemaker.  At this
time, it was decided that we would maximize medical therapy.
The Amiodarone and Lopressor doses were increased
appropriately.

On [**2173-3-25**], the patient was well enough to be discharged to
home in stable condition.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
maximum 98, temperature current 98, heart rate 60 and sinus
with intermittent atrial fibrillation, BP 156/76, respiratory
rate 20, 02 saturation 96% on room air.  The patient was at
his preoperative weight.

Predischarge x-ray showed small bilateral effusions.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times three
with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse
marginal and posterior descending artery.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Diet-controlled diabetes mellitus.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Pericarditis.
6.  Status post transurethral resection of the prostate in
[**2164**].
7.  Status post carpal tunnel surgery.
8.  Status post vascular surgery in [**2140**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Diltiazem 120 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Ativan 0.5 mg t.i.d.
5.  Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q.o.d., 1 mg p.o. q.o.d.
6.  Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets p.o. q. four to six
hours.
7.  Atorvostatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged home in good
stable condition with VNA.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in
six weeks.  The patient will also follow-up with his primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 49683**], in one week.  The
patient's Coumadin will be drawn by the visiting nurse and
called into the primary care office once a day.  Prior to
discharge, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 49683**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] by the Cardiothoracic
Service and agreed to monitor the patient's Coumadin during
the postoperative period.  The patient will call Dr.[**Name (NI) 45666**] office with any questions or concerns.
