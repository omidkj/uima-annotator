Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intensive Care Unit Stay

History of Present Illness:
Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo blind woman with CAD s/p NSTEMI in
[**2134**] and mild dementia who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] after she was
found by her daughter unconscious after a fall. The patient
states she was walking to the bathroom using her two canes when
she tripped and fell. (She lives alone but was staying at her
daughter's house that night.) Her daughter told the admitting
physician she heard the fall, ran and found the pt on the floor
unconscious for 5 minutes. EMS brought Ms. [**Known lastname 13170**] to the ER,
where head CT revealed subdural hematoma and exam revealed L
flank hematoma. Apparently some ER staff could not feel pulse on
arrival and she received chest compressions for a brief period
before this was stopped by the ER attending, who determined she
did, in fact, have a pulse. CTA was negative for PE but showed
possible small pneumonia.
.
The pt was admitted to the MICU, where she was transfused 3u
prbcs for a hct of 25, which bumped to 34. She was seen by
neurosurgery and was dilantin loaded with plan to continue on
dilantin for 10 days. She was found to have elevated troponins
and ruled in for NSTEMI, likely in setting of demand due to
ischemia, but could not receive antiplatelet agents due to
bleeds. Repeat head CT x 2 was stable. Her vitals signs have
remained stable and she has been afebrile.
.
The patient notes she has had dry cough and some cold for the
past week and CTA in the ER revealed possible small RLL
pneumonia versus aspiration. She was started on ctx/azithro to
cover possible CAP. Her white count on arrival was 6.2,
increased a few hours later to 15, then decreased to 10. Hct was
34 this AM, then 31, now 30.9. Goal was for txf to keep over 30.

.
ROS: at present the pt denies HA, cough, sob, palps, cp, abd
pain, n/v/d/c, chills. States she has pain in her L hip only and
that this is unchanged from yesterday.

REPORTS AND STUDIES

[**2136-10-5**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 1:42AM
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a small left parafalcine subdural
hematoma measuring 3 mm in diameter. Additional tiny foci of
subdural hemorrhage are seen along the right frontal cortex
(2:22) and at the high right cranial vertex, measuring 7 mm in
diameter at this level. There is no significant mass effect on
the subjacent cortex. No subfalcine herniation. The ventricles
are normal in size and configuration with no intraventricular
hemorrhage. There is moderate periventricular hypoattenuation is
consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease. Old
lacunes are seen in the right internal capsule and cerebellar
hemisphere. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are clear. There is no calvarial fracture. There is
extensive scalp/subgaleal hematoma along the left parietal bone
posteriorly.
1. Small subdural hemorrhages at the right cranial vertex and
along the left edge of the falx. No significant mass effect or
subfalcine herniation.
2. Large left scalp/subgaleal hematoma with no underlying
calvarial fracture.

[**2136-10-5**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 2:46PM
1. Subdural hematomas probably unchanged in extent with interval
redistribution along the falx.
2. Mildly increased extent of left parietal subgaleal hematoma.

[**2136-10-6**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
Slight decrease in size of right parietal-occipital subdural
hematoma as well as subdural hematoma along the falx.

[**2136-10-5**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Moderate sized left flank hematoma, measuring 8 x 4 x 12 cm.
3. Small focus of pneumonia or aspiration at the right lung
base.
4. Stable appearance of 5 mm right middle lobe nodule, sigmoid
diverticulosis, elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, hiatal
hernia, and multiple renal cysts.
4. Slightly increased subcarinal lymph node with no other
pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph
nodes.

[**2136-10-5**] CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST
1. No evidence of fracture or dislocation.
2. Moderate degenerative changes as described above.
In addition, there is mild discrepnacy in the right and left
laterala tlanto- axial distances, likely due to pt. rotation.
However, rotation subluxation cannot be excluded and needs
clinical correlation and MR cervical spine, if clinically
indicated.
Right lobe of thyroid is larger than left but assessment for
focal lesions is limited due to artifacts. If deemed necessary,
ultrasound of thyroid can be considered.

[**2136-10-5**] L-SPINE (AP & LAT)
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or dislocation.

[**2136-10-5**] BILAT HIPS (AP,LAT & AP PELVIS)
AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS AND MULTIPLE VIEWS OF THE HIPS: There is
no evidence of fracture or dislocation. The femoral heads are
well seated within the acetabula. The pelvic ring is intact. No
sacroiliac joint or pubic symphysis diastasis. Multiple
phleboliths are noted. Degenerative changes of the lower lumbar
spine are also seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or dislocation.

Brief Hospital Course:
FALL
The patient's fall was felt to be mechanical in nature, related
to her blindness and mild dementia. She developed a large
left-sided hematoma around her left hip, requiring a transfusion
of three units of packed red blood cells.  Films of the hip
showed no fracture. Ms. [**Known lastname 13170**] was seen by physical therapy who
recommended an inpatient rehab stay.  However the patient did
not want inpatient rehab and preferred to go to her daughter's
home.  This was discussed at the patient's daughter who agreed
to take her to her home.

SUBDURAL HEMATOMAS
The Patient was initially admitted to the intensive care unit
for close observation. She was called out t
