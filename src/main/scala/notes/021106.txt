History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 y/o Male with hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
and h/o ruptured AAA in [**2146**] who was admitted to NEBH on [**2153-3-12**]
for elective right total hip replacement for osteoarthritis. His
post-operative course was complicated by rapid afib with RVR to
140s on post-op day on [**2153-3-13**] accompanied by hemodynamic changes
and SBPs in the 70s. He reportedly did not have any chest pain
throughout. ECG from this time showed deep ST depressions in
precordial leads, and by notes posterior leads did not show STE.
CK returned at peak of 1516 / MB 127.90 / Trop I 23.34. He was
loaded with amiodarone and started on amio gtt, with improvement
in heart rate control and conversion into sinus rhythm.
However, he developed hypoxia and ongoing hypotension, and was
started on dopamine 2mcg/min with improvement in SBPs. STD
remained on ECG. He had an associated HCT drop and was
transfused. Platelets dropped to 96. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
this morning for urgent catheterization and continued care.

He was taken to the cath lab where angiography showed 30% LM
disease, Left Circ with 50% ostial lesion and an eccentric 70%
proximal/long lesion with subtotal occlusion that was felt to be
the culprit lesion. He also had 50% stenosis in the LAD at D1
and D1 had an ostial 50%. The RCA had a 50% mid lesion and
posterolateral branch had subtotal proximal occlusion. Cypher
stents x2 were deployed in the LCx. Following this intervention,
the patient desaturated to 70s% and was intubated. Bedside
echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation. A right heart
cath was performed that showed PA pressures of 60/35 and PCWP of
37. IABP was inserted, and he was brought to the CCU on
phenylephrine infusion for further care.

IMAGING/REPORTS:
Cardiac cath [**2153-3-14**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
2 vessel obstructive coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a 30%
distal
stenosis. The LAD had a 50% stenosis at D1. D1 had an ostial 50%

stenosis. The LCX was diffusely diseased and had a 50% ostial
stenosis,
an eccentric 70% proximal stenosis and a long subtotal mid
stenotic
segment. The RCA had a 50% stenosis in the mid portion, and
subtotal
proximal occlusion of the posterolateral branch.
2. Resting hemodynamics after PCI demonstrated elevated PA
pressures at
59/32, and elevated wedge pressure of 38mm Hg. The cardiac
output and
index were 4.92 L/min and 2.24 L/min/m2 respectively, using an
estimated
oxygen consumption of 125 ml/min/m2 (on dopamine).
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the LCX with a 3.0x33 and a
3.0x8mm Cypher stent that was complicated by poor flow distally
that
improved with IC nicardipine.
4. Successful placement of IABP through LFA.

TTE [**2153-3-14**]:
Moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function (EF
30-35%) consistent with coronary artery disease with moderate to
severe (3+) ischemic mitral regurgitation. Significant aortic
stenosis, not adequately quantified.

TTE [**2153-3-19**]: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with regional
dysfunction c/w CAD. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation. Severe pulmlnary artery systolic hypertension.
Minimal aortic valve stenosis.

Head CT [**2153-3-18**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or mass
effect.

[**2153-3-20**] RLE US: Right popliteal veins not visualized due to
patient's inability for repositioning because of pain.
Otherwise, no evidence of DVT seen in the visualized deep veins
in either right or left lower extremities.

[**2153-3-23**] Chest CT:
1. Bilateral airspace consolidations with air bronchograms
