Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2144-5-8**]:
Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement.


History of Present Illness:
84-y.o. male s/p CABG [**2144-4-21**] complicated by postop bleed and
pleural effusion with discharge [**2144-4-29**] to [**Hospital1 **]
Rehabilitation presents with abdominal pain.  RUQ US at rehab
suggested cholecystitis.  He also reports multiple episodes of
n/v at home with fevers to 100 and chills.  Zosyn was given in
the ED.

His CABG was in the setting of recent stent to RCA x1 [**10-3**].
Re-stent of occluded RCA and failed attempt to stent LAD [**3-4**] in
[**State 108**].

e patient was last seen normal sometime last evening.  This
morning at around 7:30 he woke up and noticed that the left side
of his body felt "numb".  He brought this to his nurses
attention
at about 8:00am and his doctors and eventually a neuro consult
was called.  The patient felt that his right arm felt numb or
dead up to the elbow, and he felt he had some difficulty
squeezing an examiners hand.  He was not aware of any other
weakness, and mostly complained of being very tired.  He did not
feel that the weakness had progress and reported that he felt
the
weakness was starting to improve and the sense of numbness had
nearly resolved by the time he was examined by the neurological
service.  He denied any new vision problems, did not have a
headache.  He sounded somewhat slurred but did not feel as if
his
speech was changed significantly.  Of note he was on standing
Plavix and [**State **] which had been held for the last few days (at
least since the 14), since he had the percutaneous drainage.

The patient was otherwise doing well and was to go back to rehab
to finish his course of Cipro and Flagyl on [**5-17**].

[**2144-5-6**] RUQ US showed:
Markedly distended gallbladder with sludge and stones and with a
positive son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign.  Findings are concerning for
acute cholecystitis.

MRI brain/MRA brain/MRA neck on [**5-12**]:
HEAD MRI: There are multiple small foci of slow diffusion,
indicative of
acute infarctions, within the left occipital lobe, left
cerebellar hemisphere,
right superior cerebellum, and left thalamus. They demonstrate
high signal on
T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating that they are not
hyperacute. A
focus of high T2 signal in the left body of the corpus callosum,
without
associated slow diffusion, could be related to a chronic
microvascular
infarct. There is no evidence of intracranial blood products.
The ventricles
are appropriate in size for age.

NECK MRA: The study is technically suboptimal due to the timing
of the
contrast bolus. Furthermore, the vertebral artery origin is not
included on
the images. The left vertebral artery is dominant. The preceding
neck CTA
shows mild stenosis at the left vertebral artery origin. The
preceding neck
CTA also shows mild atherosclerosis at the internal carotid
arterial origins
bilaterally, without evidence of significant stenoses.

HEAD MRA: The study is limited by motion artifact. No evidence
of arterial
occlusion, high-grade stenosis, or obvious aneurysm is seen. The
left
vertebral artery is dominant. The vessels were better evaluated
on the
preceding CTA.

IMPRESSION:
1. Acute infarctions in the left occipital lobe, left thalamus,
left
cerebellar hemisphere and right superior cerebellum.
2. Technically limited MRAs of the head and neck. Please refer
to the
preceding report for the head and neck CTA, which shows a mild
stenosis at the
left vertebral artery origin, as well as mild atherosclerosis at
the internal
carotid arterial origins without significant stenoses.


Brief Hospital Course:
CHOLECYSTITIS:
On [**2144-5-6**], the patient was admitted to the SICU for close
monitoring in the setting of recent CABG complicated by post-op
bleed and pleural effusion.  He was rendered NPO and started on
ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.  Ser
