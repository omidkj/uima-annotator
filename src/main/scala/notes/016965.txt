Chief Complaint:
anemia

History of Present Illness:
81 year old Male with a history of CAD status post CABG, chronic

systolic CHF (EF 15-20), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
recent admission [**4-17**] for GIB with negative EGD/colonoscopy
presents from home with dark red bloody diarrhea that developed
overnight and subsequent weakness and lightheadedness.
.
He reports having had a cough for 5-7 days which has been
procductive of [**Last Name (un) 30893**] sputum. He denies fever or chills. He began
feeling weak and lightheaded 2 days ago. At that point he was
having normal color bowel movements which were loose. He had
vomited once non-bloody emesis two days ago. He has had no
change in his CHF symptoms. Orthopnea is stable and no PND,
weight increase or increase in LE edema. He denies sick contacts
or [**Name2 (NI) 56616**], headache, sore throat or other symptoms. Last
night he had "explosive" diarrhea and was unable to make it to
the toilet. His wife reports that the stool was [**Last Name (un) 30212**] and that
there was also a significant amount of bright red blood. There
was also bright red blood on the toilet paper. He felt even more
lightheaded and too weak to get up and EMS was called.
.
Recent medication changes include prescription of cough
suppressants for cough but no antibiotics and increase of
spironolactone from 12.5 to 25 one week ago.
.
On arrival to the ED, he was hypotensive to the 70s. After
receiving 1L NS, his vitals were T 97.2 90 94/49 21 94% RA. An
NG lavage with 500cc returned clear fluid. There was no blood,
coffee grounds or bile. Rectal exam revealed [**Last Name (un) 30212**] stool. He
was transfused 2 units pRBCs. He was also evaluated by surgery
for a question of mesenteric ischemia, which was felt to be
unlikely. Vitals on transfer were 96 124/56 16 99RA.

Imaging:
[**5-11**] AP CXR
PORTABLE UPRIGHT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The heart is mildly
enlarged. A
left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending into the right
atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus. Multiple sternal
wires are again seen. A previously seen right basilar density
has improved. The central pulmonary vessels remain prominent,
with no evidence of overt edema. There is a retrocardiac left
basilar density, likely reflecting atelectasis, however, an
underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. Trace blunting of the
left costophrenic angle may be due to a trace effusion. No
pneumothorax seen. The study and the report were reviewed by the
staff radiologist.
.
[**5-12**] PA-L
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
increasing
parenchymal opacities at both lung bases, right more than left.
The
pre-existing small left pleural effusion is unchanged. Unchanged
size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged course of the
pacemaker leads. At the time of dictation, 8:44 a.m. on [**2149-5-13**], the referring physician,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was paged for notification.
.
[**5-15**] TEE
IMPRESSION: Mobile echodensity seen associated with the right
atrial pacing wire. Differential diagnosis includes thrombus
versus vegetation. Bioprosthetic mitral valve appears to be
well-seated. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderately depressed
left ventricular function.

Compared with the report of the prior study of [**2148-2-7**], there
are now pacing wires in the RA/RV and a mobile echodensity is
associated with the right atrial wire.
.
[**5-19**] CT-Chest-Abdomen without contrast
1. No evidence of abscess in the chest, abdomen or pelvis, as
questioned.
2. 7 cm long segment of abnormal bowel wall thickening involving
the midline small bowel, which has a dilated appearance and is
adjacent to several prominent mesenteric lymph nodes. This
appearance of aneurysmal dilation of small bowel is concerning
for small bowel lymphoma.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Diastasis of the rectus musculature.
.
[**5-22**] IR guided left sided PICC (also had right sided PICC placed
and removed, then left sided IR guided PICC placed and removed,
and then finally this PICC)
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
4 French
single lumen PICC line placement via the left brachial venous
approach. Final internal length is 46 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.
