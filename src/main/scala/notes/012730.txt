History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 116**] is a 27 year old male with known IVC mass, suspected to
be leiomyosarcoma s/p percutaneous biopsy on [**2152-1-10**].  His
initial presentation was with LE DVT in 8/[**2150**]. At that point he
was treated with Lovenox and Coumadin. Subsequently, he was
diagnosed with a large right PE despite a therapeutic INR. Upon
hematology workup, ABD CT showed a 7.4 x 7.4 x 9.7 right
suprarenal caval mass. A repeat chest CT and  triphasic CT scan
of abdomen/pelvis were done [**2152-1-5**] to delineate extent of the
IVC mass and thrombus. TTE was done [**2152-1-6**], there was no
extension of caval mass into the atrium. Right middle and lower
lobe mass confirmed on chest CT. This is planned to be resected
by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] at a later time.
He is being admitted to the HPB service for preoperative
management prior to his caval thrombectomy tomorrow.  He is
complaining of some posterior back pain secondary to his recent
percutaneous biopsy. This has been well controlled with PO
Dilaudid and Tylenol at home. He also has hemoptysis with blood
tinged sputum on tissue. He denies fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, dysuria, or
lower extremity swelling.

Brief Hospital Course:
27 y/o male admitted pre-op for heparin bridge prior to surgery.
The patient was taken to the OR with Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for
resection of the IVC mass plus IVC and right nephrectomy.
 At the time of the surgery, the patient had a large mass in the
IVC.  By intraoperative ultrasound and TEE, the mass ended
approximately 3.5 cm below the confluence of the hepatic veins
and the inferior vena cava. The mass was able to be completely
resected along with the right kidney. He tolerated the procedure
well, received three units of RBCs. Please see the operative
note for further detail.  He was transferred to the SICU for
further care.
On chest xray done to verify line placement, it was noted the
patient had a massive right-sided pleural effusion, possibly
representing hematoma, with collapse of right lung, and leftward
shift of the mediastinum and heart. This was immediately
following surgery, and a 25 G needle was placed and the patient
was on wall suction.  The chest tube initially put out 900 cc
sanguinous output. The output decreased daily and on POD 3 the
drain was removed. On POD 4 he was taken to the OR with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for a Right video assisted thoracic surgery
decortication. Clot was noted, and there was rind trapping the
right lung, which once freed, allowed the lung to expand nicely.
A new apical chest tube was then placed. When that chest tube
was removed, there was pneumothorax which had remained stable.
O2 requirements diminished. Clot culture was sent at time of
VATS, which was reported no growth.
The patient remained in the ICU post op for several days. Pain
management was an initial issue as well as the hemothorax. Once
these issues were more satisfactorily controlled, he was able to
be transferred to the regular surgical floor.
NG tube was removed on POD 5.
At that point he was having return of bowel function, and in
fact was having daily diarrhea and large volume stool output. C
diff was sent and negative, and he was started on loperamide
with good control of amount of stooling.
The patient was maintained on a heparin drip until the day of
discharge. Once therapeutic and stable, daily PTTs were around
60. He was started on lovenox for home discharge.
Patient is s/p right nephrectomy. Creatinine was 0.9 on
admission. His maximum creatinine rose to 2.3 on POD 5, and was
down to 1.4 by day of discharge. Urine output has been adequate.
The JP drain left in place from surgery was noted to look
slightly thick, outputs daily ranged from 150 - 300 cc daily. A
triglycerides was sent on the fluid (308) with 81 % lymphs.
Dietary recommendations were to continue regular diet, and
monitor both drain output amount and appearance.
The patient was tolerating regular diet, ambulating and as
noted, had return of bowel function. He remained afebrile
throughout the hospital stay.
The JP drain site appeared slightly erythematous and some
fibrinous material around drain site. Additionally there was
slight drainage from the upper apex of the incision which will
be kept covered with a DSD.
Patient will have outpatient PET scan Thursday and was given
specific dietary instruction sheet.
