Drug rash

N/A


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2643**] is a 60 year old woman with history of cirrhosis in
setting of alcohol abuse (complicated by ascites with SBP,
esophageal varices without bleed), s/p recent colectomy and
ileostomy for ischemic colitis who is referred from clinic for
change in antibiotic regimen due to drug rash while on
linezolid. She had a right colectomy in [**Month (only) **], followed by an
ex-lap with lysis of adhesions for small-bowel obstruction last
month.  She was recently rehospitalized for fever and found to
have enterococcal bacteremia for which she was started on
linezolid on [**9-25**], intended to complete a 14-day course.
.
She then developed an intensely pruritic rash starting on [**9-30**],
covering her entire body (from scalp to feet).  As an
outpatient, a PICC line was placed and her antibiotic was
switched to Vancomycin IV.  The rash has become worse and more
confluent since then, so she is admitted today for a change in
antibiotics to treat her enterococcus bacteremia.
.
Pt denies any shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, oral
lesions, or facial edema indicative of a more serious allergic
reactoin.
.
On review of systems, the pt denies fevers/chills, headaches,
dizziness or vertigo, hematemesis, coffee-ground emesis,
dysphagia, odynophagia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, melena,
hematochezia, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain,
palpitations, increasing lower extremity swelling, orthpnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She does endorse some
light-headedness recently and mild dyspnea on exertion.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old woman with history of EtOH cirrhosis (complicated by
ascites with SBP, esophageal varices without bleed), s/p recent
colectomy and ileostomy for ischemic colitis w/ enterococcus
bacteremia while on both vancomycin and linezolid who is
referred from clinic for drug rash, likely secondary to
linezolid.
.
## Enterococcus bacteremia - When initially discovered, this was
treated with rifaximin and linezolid and she consequently
developed the rash days later.  Vancomycin was then started on
[**10-1**], without resolution of rash.  It remains unclear if this
rash represents allergy to vancomycin as well, given the fact
that a drug rash time course is often variable.  She was
switched to ampicillin IV Q6 hours, as the sensitivities
indicated that this antibiotic choice was appropriate, and her
rash continued to improve. A home IV pump was arranged by case
management and she was discharged with her PICC line for home
infusion of ampicillin.  An echocardiogram was done to rule out
endocardititis and it did not show any vegetations.  She will
need to have follow-up labs (CBC, BUN/Cr) drawn in 1 week to be
sure the antibiotic is not creating any new issues that need to
be addressed.  Blood cultures are still pending on discharge as
well.
.
## Hypokalemia - Each morning during this admission, the
patient's K+ level was below the normal range, requiring
supplementation with KCl.  This was likely secondary to her high
ostomy output.  Even though her spironolactone was uptitrated
from 25mg to 50mg just prior to admission for management of
lower extremity edema, it was decided to discharge her with 20
mEq KCl supplementation daily.
.
## Diarrhea - The patient developed liquidy, green stools.  C.
Diff toxin was sent and negative.  Since we felt that her
diarrhea was likely due to bacterial overgrowth rather than some
sort of invasive bacterial infection (otherwise asymptomatic),
we discharged her with Lomotil to help form her stools.  We felt
that this would also help with her hypokalemia (as above).
.
## Alcohol cirrhosis: Per patient, she had not had an alcoholic
beverage since [**2122-6-23**]. She is currently working on [**7-1**] months
sober outside of the hospital to qualify for possible liver
transplant. We continued her regimen of lasix/spironolactone for
ascites/lower extremity edema management.
.
## History of SBP/ non-bleeding esophageal varices:
Ciprofloxacin 500mg daily and nadolol was continued while she
continues to be on tube feeds at home.  She did not develop any
ascites or GI bleeds during the admission.
.
## VNA directives: We confirmed proper placement of the feeding
tube and she should continue to be on tube feeds,
