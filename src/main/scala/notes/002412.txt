[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   66 year old man with s/p CABG - hx alzeiheimers with
confusion please limit
   time in radiology
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   evaluate for effusion



Provisional Findings Impression: ARHb [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**2173-3-2**] 12:38 PM
Left lower lung opacity demonstrates interval improvement which
may represent
atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions.


Final Report
INDICATION: History of Alzheimer's with confusion.

COMPARISON: CXR, [**2173-2-25**].

FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST: Patient is status post CABG and
median sternotomy.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged. The
pulmonary vascularity
appears stable. Left lower lung opacity, likely representing
atelectasis,
demonstrates mild improvement with small bilateral pleural
effusions noted.
The right lung appears clear and there is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Improved left lower lung opacity with small
bilateral pleural
effusions.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Lipomatous hypertrophy
of the interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity
size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV
systolic function.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Mildly dilated descending
aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets. Mild MVP.
Eccentric MR jet. Mild to moderate ([**2-5**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS. Physiologic (normal) PR.


PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta
is mildly dilated. There are
