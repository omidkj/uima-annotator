Date of Birth:  [**2084-11-13**]             Sex:   M

Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, Hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Thoracentesis
Right Hemicolectomy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 y/o M with PMH of HTN, EtOH cirrhosis (no active
EtOH use), hyperlipedemia, and neuropathic right heel ulceration
s/p debridement and treatment with wound vac at rehab who was
transferred from his rehabilitation facility to [**Hospital3 26615**] on
[**2143-12-10**] with fevers, hypotension, and left shoulder pain.
.
At the OSH, initial vitals were remarkable for a BP of 78/31 and
HR=119. Subsequently developed atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Received digoxin and beta blockade after which he converted to
sinus rythm. Labs notable for a WBC of 19.6, Na 127, Cl 99, HCO3
17, Cr 2.0, BUN 44. CE (-) x3. A renal US was unremarkable. CXR
with ?left infiltrate, and UA with significant pyuria. He had
been recently started on Augmentin 875mg [**Hospital1 **] for presumed UTI.
He was treated with fluids and IV antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) at
[**Hospital3 26615**] for presumed sepsis as well as lovenox for ?PE. VQ
scan was low probability for a PE and the lovenox was stopped. A
CT scan was done due to continued shoulder pain and SOB which
showed a mediastinal mass with ?extravasation of blood from the
aortic arch. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on a labetolol
drip for further evaluation by cardiothoracic surgery.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was found to be HD stable with HR in the
80s and sbp between 110 - 120.  O2 saturation of 97% on 4L NC,
breathing 25 breaths per minutes. Still reported left shoulder
pain. The pain has been present for 3-4 days, feels sharp, wakes
patient up from sleep occasionally. He denies any chest pain or
pressure.

Past Medical History:
- Alcoholic Cirrhosis (per reported history no drinks x1.5 yrs)

- Chronic neuropathic heel ulcer with hx of MRSA in the wound 1
year ago, s/p debridement and treatment with wound vac at rehab.
- HTN
- Depression
- Chronic venous stasis


Social History:
Homeless, prior history of alcoholism but claims abstinence for
1.5 years, still smokes pack of cigarettes daily, former nurse
who worked at [**Hospital1 2025**] and [**Location (un) 8599**]who has not worked since [**2137**].

FROM [**Hospital3 **]
.
TTE without vegitations.
.
CT Chest [**12-11**]:
1. Leaking ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm with hematoma
within the superior mediastinum
2. Large left pleurall effusion
3. Splenic varices and splenomegaly
.
Renal US [**12-11**]:
1. No hydronephrosis
2. Elongated son[**Name (NI) 15487**] area in the upper pole of the left
kidney
which could represent and elongated cyst or dilated calix.
.
CXR Three view [**12-10**]:
Impression: Mild hazy opacity in LL base, could represent PNA,
mild blunting of posterior costophrenic angles which could
represent small effusions.
.
CXR Portable [**12-11**]:
Impression: New CHF. Component of LLL PNA cannot be excluded
.
VQ Scan [**12-11**]:
Impression: Low suspiscion lung scan for pulmonary embolic
disease
.
AT [**Hospital1 18**]:
.
IMAGING:
[**12-22**] CT torso: 1. The patient is now intubated, and there is
focal parenchymal opacification distributed throughout the lungs
bilaterally consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Bilateral
pleural effusions > left side. 2. Stable appearance to a
high-density fluid collection in the anterior - superior
mediastinum when compared to prior imaging from [**2143-12-11**]. 3. Cirrhotic liver with sequelae of portal hypertension
including splenomegaly, ascites and splenorenal varices. 4. No
abdominal collection or abscess identified. No evidence for
anastomotic leak. 5. Small seroma under the lower half of the
laparotomy wound but there is no evidence for abdominal wall
diastasis to suggest connection with the peritoneal cavity
ascites.
[**12-23**] TTE:Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult
to position. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function
.
[**12-24**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant change. Low lung volumes with multiple parenchymal
bilateral opacities and bilateral pleural effusions. Unchanged
coexistence of both fluid overload and multifocal infection. No
newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities. No evidence of
pneumothorax.
.
[**12-24**] B/l LE U/s: No evidence of DVT.
.
[**12-25**]: Renal U/s: Very limited visualization of the kidneys due
to the patient's body habitus. No gross abnormality is
identified. Arterial and venous flow is seen bilaterally within
the kidneys. Large amount of ascites
.
[**12-26**] CXR As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
position has completely unchanged. On this basis, the left
hemithorax appears dense and the right hemithorax appears less
dense than before. Overall; however, it is likely that the
pre-existing multifocal opacities have not substantially
changed. Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and
moderate left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Unchanged
monitoring and support devices.
.
[**12-27**] Abdomen US: mod ascites
.
[**12-29**] CXR:
Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged. Right PICC
tip is in the lower SVC. ET tube is in standard position. NG
tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. There is no evident
pneumothorax. Widened mediastinum is stable. Large left pleural
effusion is probably unchanged allowing the difference in
positioning of the patient with adjacent atelectasis. The right
lung is grossly clear. Pulmonary edema has improved, almost
resolved.
[**12-31**] CXR:
1. Gradual mediastinal widening; consider a follow-up radiograph
in supine positioning.
2. Mediastinal contours demonstrate the lymphadenopathy and
contained
dissection/pseudoaneurysm better seen on prior CT.
3. Moderate left pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis
and mild pulmonary edema; underlying infection cannot be
excluded.
.
[**1-1**] CXR:
Widened mediastinum is stable allowing the difference in
positioning of the patient. Cardiomegaly is also unchanged.
Right central catheter tip is in the lower SVC. ET tube is seen
in standard position. NG tube tip is out of
