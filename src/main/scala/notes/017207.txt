Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
hip pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
24yo woman with hx SLE, CKD(not currently on HD or PD), labile
HTN here with right leg pain and HTN urgency. Patient was
recently d/ced on [**9-14**] following admission for the same
complaints.
.
Patient took her hydralazine dose on am of admission. BP at
presentation to the ER was 250/140 (The patient reportedly has
baseline SBPs in 130-170s) She was given 900 labetolol and 50
hydralazine in the ED. BP following this was 175/124. Her EKG

.
Patient also complaining of [**10-20**] right hip pain. Patient was
d/ced on [**9-14**] with oral dilaudid for hip/leg pain. She took this
only for one day due to severe itching. Denies any
parasthesias/weakness. Her RLE/hip pain has been extensively
worked up with negative LENIs, Lumbar spine MRI and hip plain
films in the past. She was given 4mg IV morphine in the ER.
.
On admission to the floor, leg/hip pain somwhat improved with
morphine.She denies any headache, vision changes, double vision,
chest pain or SOB. Feels warm but no chills.

Pertinent Results:
MRI Right Hip ([**9-18**]): There is no signal abnormality on the
fluid-sensitive
sequences in the proximal femur, acetabulum, or other osseous
structure. On T1- weighted images, there is a focal rounded
region within the right femoral head measuring approximately 9
mm in a subchondral location, which is nonspecific but may
represent an unusual focus of red marrow. No sclerosis is seen
on the corresponding plain films. There is a small right hip
joint effusion and a small amount of fluid in the left hip joint
as well, at the upper limits of normal. There is no soft tissue
abnormality, no muscular edema, and no fluid collections.
IMPRESSION: 1. Small right hip joint effusion. 2. No bone marrow
edema in the proximal femurs or the pelvis. 3. Nonspecific small
focus of low signal on T1-weighted images in the right femoral
head is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red
marrow.

TTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18 mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is
identified. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
output. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no
systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
hyperdynamic systolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Findings consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**],
pulmonary hypertension has developed (also present on the study
from [**2140-5-20**]). Pericardial effusion is also new.

V/Q scan ([**9-21**]): Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol
in 8 views demonstrate no focal defects with improved
ventilation to the posterior right basal segment.  Perfusion
images in the same 8 views show improved perfusion to the
posterior right basal segement with a persistent small defect
but no new findings.
Chest x-ray shows cardiomgealy and left basilar atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Improved V/Q scan from [**9-/2139**] with no findings to
suggest acute pulmonary embolism.

B/L upper ext U/S ([**9-21**]): Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] of
the
right and left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial,
basilic and cephalic veins were performed. There is nonocclusive
focal thrombus seen in the left subclavian vein, where the vein
is not fully compressible. Flow is seen in the region,
indicating that the thrombus is nonocclusive. Elsewhere, normal
flow, augmentation, compressibility were appropriate and
waveforms are demonstrated.
IMPRESSION:
1. Focal nonocclusive thrombus in the left subclavian vein.
2. Otherwise, patent upper extremity veins as described.

[**2141-9-21**] CXR:
There is no significant change when compared to the recent
previous
examination.
The previously described left retrocardiac opacity is unchanged
in appearance.
Cardiomegaly is also unchanged. The mediastinal contour, bony
thorax and
pulmonary vasculature are normal.
IMPRESSION: No significant change compared to study done roughly
7 hours
prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
