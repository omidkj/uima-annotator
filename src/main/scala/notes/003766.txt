MICROBIOLOGY:
============
[**2153-9-27**] URINE (Catheter) - Legionella Urinary Antigen,
PRESUMPTIVE POSITIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.

IMAGING:
=======
[**2153-9-27**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Feeding tube terminates in the
proximal stomach. Patchy bibasilar opacities, slightly improved
on the left. Although possibly related to atelectasis,
aspiration should also be considered.
.
SPEECH & SWALLOW:
================
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Safest recommendation continues to be NPO, however patient's
family understands and is willing to accept risks of aspiration
(patient not yet made CMO) and continue po intake, suggest small
sips of honey thick liquids and puree consistencies;
2. Pills crushed with small bites of puree at home;
3. Monitor hydration as patient at risk of dehydration on
thickened liquids.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Cough, question of PNA per CXR, Urine legionella screen
positive, fever to 102 in ED & looked unwell to 24H PCA.
Currently patient afebrile & o2 sats stable on RA. Family

#Dementia
Increase in behavioral symptoms since wife had recent stroke &
is no longer in home, despite 24H PCAs in house. Past recent
[**Hospital1 18**] admissions for wandering, aggitation: has had Psych & [**Last Name (un) **]
consultaions. Reportedly with poor orientation at baseline.
Oriented to self (name & DOB) during this admission. Goals for
patient, per disscussions with family & HCP, now palliation.
Family will pursue home Hospice services and continue 24H PCAs.
Family to discuss w/ primary care physician utility of
continuing medications such as namenda and aricept given current
status. Would also be reasonable to consider [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for
secretions, should they become copious and bothersome to
patient, such as scopolamine. Use as needed low dose risperidal
for agitation.

# Failed swallow study x's 2
The patient continues to present with overt aspiration and had
pulled out a pedi-NGT that had been placed. After discussion
with family & with HCP by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] via TC: no more NGT's, no
g-tubes to be placed and the patient will be offered food for
comfort, with the accepted risk of aspiration.
.
# Guaiac positive stool.
Hemodynamically stable, GI was consulted and per discussion with
the family, the patient would likely not want further work-up
for this issue. This has been discussed by their report in the
past with the patient's PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Hct 32.8 on [**2153-9-28**].
.
# Anemia
Baseline of 30-35. B12 474 (low normal) and folate 14.0 on
[**2153-7-19**]. Current drop in HCT thought due to GIB, but now
stablized. No further W/U a
