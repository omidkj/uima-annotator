distress

patient was intubated [**Date range (1) 62601**] and again [**Date range (1) 62602**]
Thoracentesis
Central line (removed on [**9-16**])

History of Present Illness:
48 yo female no past medical history was at home with her
husband when she suddenly developed slurred speach, left sided
weakness and gaze deviation. She was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where
her BP was found to be 253/123, she had a head CT which showed a
10 cc R parietal intracranial hemmorhage with some underlying
vasogenic edema, no midline shift. She was intubated, given
Dilantin and Ativan and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2195-8-30**].
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] was admitted to the neurology service ICU given
Dilantin, Labetolol for BP control, head MRI was performed. MRI
showed multiple foci concerning for embolic cause vs.
vasculitis. LP was performed, CSF cytology was negative for
malignancy, fluid not infectious with WBC of 1 and no growth on
culture.
Head MRI on [**2195-8-30**] revealed ~2x2 cm right temporal lobe
intraparenchymal hematoma with surrounding fluid collection,
which may represent edema and/or serum-like exudate from the
adjacent hematoma; in addition multiple lesions in the frontal
and parietal lobes, the pons, and the cerebellum were thought to
be focal old lacunar infarcts concerning for embolic pathology,
but these will be analyzed further with a head MRI w/ contrast.
.
An arteriogram was performed [**2195-8-31**] which ruled out vasculitis,
vascular malformation, vascular occlusion, stenosis, or
aneurysm.
.
On [**2195-9-1**] her CXR was noted to have moderate size effusion on
the right. A CT torso was performed to evaluate for possible
sources of malignancy, this showed bibasilar consolidations and
pleural effusions, lesions within the liver, and an enlarged
left adrenal gland. A TTE was performed to evaluate for possible
endocarditis, no valvular vegetations were visualized. She was
extubated on [**2195-9-2**], her rt pleural effusion was tapped
yielding bloody fluid exudative by LDH. Tiny pneumothorax post
tap.
.
Analysis of pleural fluid identified neoplastic cells consistent
with mesothelioma. However, chest CT [**2195-9-12**] showed no definite
nodular areas of pleural thickening that would be indicative of
mesothelioma.
.
She grew enterococci in her urine [**2195-9-1**], was initially treated
with vancomycin, and now being treated with levofloxacin
beginning [**2195-9-4**]. Also had MSSA positive sputum and possible
consolidation on lung treated with levo/flagyl beginning
[**2195-9-4**]. A repeat ultrasound was performed of the left sided
pleural effusion and the acute read was that there was
insufficient to tap.
.
Patient was reintubated [**9-5**] for respiratory distress likely
secondary to pneumonia, and extubated [**9-13**]. Patient currently
alert and speaking, and has tolerated diet recommended by
nutrition. She moves out of bed with difficulty, requiring a
walker and support. She is currently is on 4LNC oxygen and she
will likely require oxygen at home.
