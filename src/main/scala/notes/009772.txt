Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3376**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Line Placement
IVC Filter placement

History of Present Illness:
55yoM with h/o hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, CAD, and
morbid obesity, presenting with massive PE.
.
The patient initially presented today to his PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/o
dyspnea. He was recently treated for pneumonia but dyspnea
persisted. He was referred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED where he became
acutely unresponsive and hypotensive. He was intubated for
airway protection and given CTX, Azithro. A heparin gtt was
started given concern for PE, aspirin given, and he was started
on dopamine gtt for BP support.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED VS T 98 HR 87 BP 208/175 RR 29
97%intubated . Bedside echo revealed right heart strain and
right heart failure raising further concern for PE. CTA
confirmed diagnosis of bilateral PA PEs. He was heparinized and
then received tPA 100mg. He also received 8L NS. ECG showed new
TWI in V1-V3 with elevated CK's. Labs showed acute renal
failure, lactic acidosis, and +AG metabolic acidosis.

Pertinent Results:
Radiology:
BLENI: Non-occlusive filling defect in right common femoral
vein. No left lower extremity DVT.
.
CTA: Large bilateral pe's including withing the right and left
main pulmonary arteries; perhaps slight right ventricular
enlargement, but no pulmonary artery enlargement
.
CXR: Linear areas of atelectasis and area of subsegemental
atelectasis in the left lower lobe. A small, focal area of
infiltrate cannot be excluded. Endotracheal tube 8 cm superior
to the carina.
.
ECG: 85bpm, NSR, RBBB, left axis deviation, TWI V1-V3
.
Echo: The right atrium is dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is >20 mmHg. There is symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. There is severe
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
55yoM with h/o HTN, CAD, TIIDM p/w massive bilateral PE
resulting in obstructive shock, NSTEMI, and right heart failure
who underwent surgery for colonic mass found upon colonoscope
for GI bleed.
.
# PE/shock: Massive PE with resultant obstructive shock and
right heart failure s/p lysis with TPA. Patient was intubated at
OSH and was continued on mechanical ventilation for airway
protection. He was transiently on dopamine for pressure support
which was weaned with stable blood pressures. Echo showed RV
strain and RV dilation. BNP was >70,000 with troponin leak (TnT
1.0) c/w massive PE. He was doing well on PS and had an RSBI of
44 and extubated on [**1-29**] without problems. [**Name (NI) **] was continued on
an IV heparin gtt. A right sided permanent IVF filter was placed
due to clot burden in the right right common femoral vein.
Patient was also started on stress dose steroids due to h/o of
chronic prednisone use due to either gout vs. nephrotic
syndrome. He was intially on Hydrocortisone 100 mg q 8 hrs then
tapered to 50 mg q 8 hrs. Upon leaving the ICU to the floor his
hemodynamics were stable. Patient will need a reapeat Echo in
aproximately 3 months to assess his RV. Heparin was held
starting [**2-2**] due to findings on colonoscopy and ongoing melena
despite stable hematocrit. Patient likely needs to be
anticoagulated in the long term given PE and permanent IVC
filter.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated for airway
protection. Initial gas showed inadequate compensation for
metabolic acidosis which improved with increase in resp rate. He
was weaned off the vent and extubated on [**1-29**] without
complications.
.
# GIB. Patient developed melena while on IV Heparin. EGD by GI
showed mild gastritis. Patient had ongoing melena with stable
Hct. C-scope showed at 6 cm polyp in the sigmoid colon. ?if this
is causing melena given lesion is distal, ?small bowel lesion as
well. Plans for sigmoidoscopy by GI on Monday [**2-5**] for bx vs.
excision. IV heparin on hold since [**2-2**] given ongoing bleeding.

# Colonic mass:  The patient underwent a colonoscopy which
revealed a large mass in the distal sigmoid or upper rectum.
Plans were made for colonoscopic resection. The patient was
taken to the endoscopy suite on [**2-5**] and despite
multiple attempts the polyp was seen to be quite large,
friable and the base could not be visualized. The polyp was
large and seemed to be prolapsing down into the rectum from
the sigmoid colon. The base of the polyp was tattooed and
surgery was recommended.  The patient underwent Laparoscopically
assisted sigmoid colectomy, primary end to end stapled
anastomosis on [**2153-2-5**].
.
# Leukocytosis with left shift and bandemia. Thought to be a
stress response in setting of acute PE. His WBC normalized
rapidly. He was initially treated with Vancomycin due to GPC in
[**1-11**] bottles at OSH which eventually grew beta strep. Vancomycin
was discontinued. During perioperative period, the patient was
started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl empirically. Patient remained
afebrile throughout the hospitalization.
.
# ARF: h/o chronic kidney disease d/t diabetic/hypertensive
nephropathy vs. h/o nephrotic syndrome. Baseline creatinine not
known. Patient continued to make good urine. ARF likely prerenal
azotemia vs. ATN. U/A showed granular casts, rare eos. Cr
continues to trend down. Restarted [**Last Name (un) **] on [**2-3**] at lower dose to
titrate up as tolerated.
.
# DM2. Patient on NPH and sliding scale. FS wnl here while NPO
then increased to 200's with fluids. [**Last Name (un) **] consult placed and
following. Scale increased on [**1-31**].  FS 124 at time of
discharge.

#Adrenal status: Patient was placed on stress dose steroids
given home Prednisone use. His Hydrocortisone was tapered and
the patient was discharged on his home regimen of 5mg
Prednisone.
.
# Hypertension. Patient hypotensive and in shock initially,
started to become hypertensive off all meds on [**2-2**]. Given lasix
and IV hydral with response. BP in 180s during the evening,
restarted [**Last Name (un) **] at lower dose, Cr stable, on [**2-3**]. Also given prn
IV hydral for elevated systolic pressures. Patient was on beta
blocker at home however has baseline HR in 40-50s therefore not
restarted.   The patient was restarted on his home
anti-hypertensive therapy with return to bowel function.
.
# Bradycardia. Sinus brady to 40's while sleeping and during the
day while awake. Patient reports HR in the 40s at home and has
never been symptomatic. Held BB while here. Normal rate at time
of discharge.
.
restarted diet, tolerating well, likely needs to be NPO for
signoidoscopy planned for [**2-5**], repleting lytes prn. The
patient's diet was advanced when bowel function returned
following surgery and was tolerating regular diet at time o
