85yoF w/ CAD s/p CABG in [**2089**] and recurrent anemia, presents
with RLQ abdominal pain, increased SOB, and generally feeling
unwell. She has been feeling generally unwell for several days
and was considering coming into the hospital. Last night after

notable for Hct 19 and Cr 3.1. Rectal exam notable for maroon
stool. Pt given 80mg IV pantoprazole and started on a
pantoprazole drip. Transfused two units PRBC. EKG notable for
marked changes from previous EKG with TWI and ST changes in
lateral leads. Trop 0.11. Cards recommended transfusion, as this
is likely demand ischemia. Pt did not tolerate NG tube
placement. Got a non-con abdominal CT before coming up. Has one
18G IV. Recent vitals: 66 180/70 16 99%RA, and she is pain free.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2111-11-19**]):    NO GROWTH.


IMAGING:
[**2111-11-17**] CT abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Evaluation limited given the lack of IV contrast. Normal
non-contrast appearance of the bowel.
2. Large fat-containing ventral wall hernia in the right lower
quadrant.
3. Multiple hyperdense renal cysts bilaterally, likely
proteinaceous or hemorrhagic. However, many of these have
increased in size when compared to the [**2107-11-21**] renal
MRI. Followup MRI should be considered if clinically warranted.
4. Cholelithiasis.
5. Small left adnexal cyst, which appears stable when compared
to the [**2107**] MRI.

[**2111-11-18**] EGD:
Large hiatal hernia
Normal mucosa in the stomach
Abnormal stomach pigmentation noted in the antrum and prepyloric
area. Biopsies were obtained to rule out possible melanotic
lesions versus other etiology
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Abnormal pigmentation noted duodenal bulb similar to what was
found in stomach. (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommend capsule endoscopy

PATHOLOGY:
DIAGNOSIS:
Antrum, biopsy (A):
No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
