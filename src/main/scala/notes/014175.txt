CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Triple air leaking and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old
Caucasian male with history of severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea on BiPAP, coronary
artery disease status post myocardial infarction times two,
atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, history of
triple air repair.  The patient presented on transfer to the
Medicine Service twenty-four hour after transfer to the MICU
for respiratory distress.  The patient originally presented
on [**2191-7-15**] to the [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with abdominal
pain and fever.  At that time, KUB showed probable ileus.  CT
of the abdomen was negative.  Over the next few days, the
etiology of the abdominal pain remained unclear despite
Gastrointestinal, Urology, Infectious Disease and Cardiology
consults.  On [**2191-7-22**], he was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for question for leaky thoracic
aortic dissection.  At the outside hospital he had been
started on Levaquin for abdominal source and Vancomycin for
MRSA-positive blood cultures and pneumonia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
4.  Sleep apnea.
5.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
6.  Compression fracture.
7.  Hypertension.
8.  Right hip fracture status post open reduction and
internal fixation.
9.  ? seizure disorder.
10. Hypercholesterolemia.
11. History of pneumonia.
12. Osteoarthritis.
13. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

FAMILY HISTORY:  History was notable for coronary artery
disease and TB.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit tobacco 17 years ago, but
has a 40 pack history.  The patient denies alcohol use.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN, VIOXX, AND
TYLENOL.
[**Hospital1 69**] course was notable for
admission to Vascular Surgery Service, where he underwent CT
of the chest on [**2191-7-22**], which showed evidence for
diaphragm level, descending thoracic aorta aneurysm with
penetrating ulcer versus mycotic aneurysm, without hematoma
or bleeding.  Vascular procedure was planned for possibly the
next week.  In the SICU the patient had ? seizure and he was
evaluated by the Department of Neurology.  At that time he
was not given any treatment.  Breathing became increasingly
labored over the next few days and he was transferred to the
MICU for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
respiratory distress management.

The MICU course involved activation of nebulized Albuterol
and Atrovent steroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease flare, and continuation of Levofloxacin and
Vancomycin for tracheobronchitis.  Per the Department of
Vascular Surgery, blood pressure control was goal to be less
than 140 systolic and he was started on Diltiazem,
Hydrochlorothiazide, and Captopril to prevent the aortic
ulceration.  The patient was thought to have acute
respiratory alkalosis or chronic respiratory acidosis by the
MICU team.  The patient tolerated BiPAP in the NICU with pH
of 7.53, pCO2 51 and pO2 of 62 on face-mask oxygen.

On [**2191-7-25**], the patient was finally transferred to [**Location (un) 2655**]
Service for further management.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on transfer:
Temperature 98.3, pulse 96, blood pressure 122/50, saturating
on 98% on two liters, respiratory rate 25.  GENERAL:  This is
a chronically ill-appearing male in no acute distress; O2
versus nasal cannula.  HEENT:  Sclera was clear, anicteric.
Pupils equal, round, with minimal reaction.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Mucous membranes moist.  NECK:  There
was right double lumen catheter placed in the right IJ,
unable to assess JVD at that time.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Distinct
heart sounds, regular in rhythm, no murmurs.  LUNGS:  Air
movement was fair with end-expiratory wheezes, diffusely.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds, hypoactive.  No masses.  EXTREMITIES:  Positive
Pneumoboots in place.  No appreciable edema.  Scattered upper
extremity ecchymosis, positive Foley.  NEUROLOGICAL:  5/5
strength bilaterally.  The patient was alert and oriented
times three.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the following:
White count 9.2, down from 40.3, hematocrit 28.2, down from
31.7, platelet count 362,000.  PT 12.8, INR 1.1, PTT 26.8.
Urinalysis from [**2191-7-23**] was negative.  Chem 7:  Sodium 134,
potassium 3.8, chloride 89, bicarbonate 38, BUN 23,
creatinine 0.5, blood sugar 136.  CKs were less than 100
times three; troponin 1.5 on [**2191-7-22**].  Potassium was 8.9,
magnesium 1.7, phosphate 3.3, albumin 2.8.  ABG on [**2191-7-25**]
at 4:50 AM was pH 7.47, pCO2 57, pO2 165 on four liters
oxygen.  Chest x-ray on [**7-25**]/200 showed chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease with linear atelectasis, scarring in the
left upper lobe, no pneumothorax, no congestive heart
failure.  Blood cultures from [**2191-7-24**] showed no growth to
date.  Urine cultures on [**2191-7-23**] showed no growth to date.
Blood cultures from [**2189-7-15**] had 1 out of 1 bottle notable
for Oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  Sputum from
[**2191-7-17**] had moderate Oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus with 0 to 5 polys on high power field.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

#1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had history of coronary
artery disease and myocardial infarction.  He was continued
on Captopril, but no beta blockade or aspirin secondary to
his triple A.  Aspirin and Coumadin were discussed with the
Vascular Surgery Service.

#2.  HYPERTENSION:  Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] had history of severe
hypertension, but he has been under good control with
Captopril 50 mg PO t.i.d.; Hydrochlorothiazide; and
Diltiazem.  In the last few days, medications have been
titrated up to keep the systolic blood pressure below 140 per
Vascular Surgery.  The Department of Vascular Surgery
continued to follow the patient during his stay and
recommended no further treatment at this time.

The patient may undergo aortic repair after the resolution of
medical problems and recommended no further imaging.  The
patient will follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after discharge.

#3.  PULMONARY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] had severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation secondary to baseline severe
disease.  He was continued on Albuterol and Atrovent nebs and
MDI.  He was also continued on Prednisone with slow taper and
....................cast.   The patient's oxygen requirement
decreased to two liters, which is his home requirement.  He
tolerates BiPAP well at night for approximately four hour to
six hours.  In the intervening days, the patient's
respiratory examination improved slightly.  He is continued
on antibiotics, Vancomycin one gram q.12 hours for complete
ten-day course for MRSA pneumonia and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation.

#4.  HEMATOLOGY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] had baseline chronic anemia.
Hematocrit was notable to be at low 28.2 on [**2191-7-25**].  The
hematocrits since that time have been improved with the
hematocrit on [**2191-7-27**] being 33.  Iron studies were done
with the iron of 143, TIBC 183, ferritin greater than 100,
and TRF 141.  The patient was thought not to be iron
deficient at this time.  The patient has had workup for
anemia over the past six months, which was unrevealing.  All
stools were guaiac tested.

#5.  RENAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] had stable renal function and
required occasional repletion of potassium and magnesium.

#6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] was NPO for several days,
but then tolerated clears.  Diet was slowly advanced to a
regular diet and the patient was able to tolerate macaroni
and cheese on [**2191-7-26**].  Protonix was given as prophylaxis.

#7.  NEUROLOGICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] had new seizure without prior
seizure history.  Per the Neurological Department the patient
will need head CT and EEG for further evaluation.  No furt
