Brief Hospital Course:
23F admitted [**2134-7-26**] for bilateral pulmonary embolisms s/p
laparoscopic appendectomy on [**2134-7-20**].  She underwent a CTA of
her chest, which showed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli.
She was started on a heparin drip and transferred to the ICU.
Cardiology and Vascular Surgery were consulted.  They
recommended therapeutic enoxaparin, which was given.  To assess
the strain on the heart, an echocardiogram was performed, which
showed right free wall hypokinesis, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation,
and dilation of the right ventricle.
    On [**7-27**], heme was consulted, and they recommended lifelong
discontinuation of her oral contraceptive pills.  They also
advised a six-month course of warfarin.  She underwent a repeat
echo, which showed no change.
    On [**7-28**], a repeat CTA/CTV of th echest was performed as
well as a CT of the pelvis to evaluate thrombus burden and to
evaluated for iliofemoral clot, respectively.  A repeat echo was
unchanged.  She was put on a regular diet, which she tolerated
well.
    On [**7-29**], she was advanced to PO pain meds.  Given her
experience, she had anxiety, and so social work was consulted to
evaluate for therapy options.  From a cardiovascular standpoint,
catheter directed thorombolysis was planned for the next
morning, so she was switched over to a heparin drip.
    On [**7-30**], catheter directed thrombolysis was attempted but
ultimately aborted before tPa was given secondary to her right
pulmonary artery pressures being found to be normal.  A repeat
echo showed minimal dilation of the ventricle.  She was
transferred to the floor in stable condition.  Cardiology
recommended 3 weeks of fondaparinux (7.5 mg SC daily) every day
with a transition to warfarin as an outpatient.
    On [**7-31**], she was doing well and discharged home in stable
condition.
