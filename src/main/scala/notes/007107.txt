History of Present Illness:
72 year old female with MS, dyslipidemia, transferred from
[**Hospital3 7571**]today for management of new congestive heart
failure.  She presented on [**2188-11-2**] to OSH for worsening and
severe nonproductive cough x 4 days, limiting ability to speak
and accompanied by posttussive emesis.  No fevers, CP, or
dizziness.  Decreased exercise tolerance.
.
In the [**Location (un) **] ED: VS: T 97.6, BP 157/32, P 111, RR 22, O2sat
100% on 2L.  She was diagnosed with bronchitis and given
steroids and bronchodilators in the ED.  While awaiting
admission, she went to the bathroom v. bed pan where she
collapsed.  She apparently suffered a respiratory arrest during
which time she was cyanotic and unresponsive.  She was
emergently intubated and sedated with propofol.  VS recorded
after this event showed: BP 124/76, RR 20.  EKG showed sinus
rhythm with known LBBB.  She was admitted to ICU where she
became hypotensive so was started on dopamine which was
subsequently changed to levophed.  TTE showed LV dilatation with
an EF 10%, minimally dilated RV with hypokinesis, moderate MR,
PASP 30.  CTA chest showed 2 small left-sided subsegmental PEs
and small bilateral aspiration pneumonias and pleural effusions.
 Pt started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and flagyl for
aspiration pneumonia and heparin gtt for PE.  Accodring to
report, she had coffee grounds in her NG on the day prior to
transfer and was started on IV pantoprazole; Hct stable ~40.
She had mild, serially rising trop: 0.08 -> 0.1 -> 0.63 -> 0.93
but has not been given aspirin due to gastritis. Prior to
transfer here, she was weaned off her levophed and propofol and
extubated; her RIJ and femoral triple lumen venous catheter were
also removed. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] further cardiology
evaluation of new CHF as well as UA versus NSTEMI with possible
plan for cardiac cath.    She has 2 PIV in place.
.
On arrival to the CCU, her vitals were T:98.6 BP:129/59 HR:111
RR:21 O2 sat:99% on 2LNC. Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia at
111BPM, normal axis, LBBB which did not meet Sgarbossa criteria
for MI in LBBB. She was uncooperative with exam but would repeat
single word phrases and open eyes to command. Accodring to her
husband and daughter, the patient is forgetful at baseline but
is able to have an engaging conversation and is independent with
ADLs.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yoF with PMH MS, HL, HTN, LBBB and dementia was transfered
from [**Hospital3 **] for management of newly depressed EF of
10% s/p intubation for a respiratory arrest and presumed COPD
exacerbation / PNA. Of note, she also developed PE and acute
hepatitis during that admission. On the night of transfer to the
CCU at [**Hospital1 18**] she became acutely tachypneic. A venous gas was
drawn which showed a serum bicarbonate of 14 down from 18 and a
lactate  of 8.9. She received 3 amps of bicarbonate 50 mEq and a
central venous catheter was placed. Her initial CVP was 16.
During placement of her Aline she developed a wide complex
tachycardia. She became unresponsive. A Code Blue was called and
a single, synchronized shock was delivered. She returned to
sinus tachycardia with a blood pressure is the 80s systolic. She
was bag valve mask ventilated thereafter. She received an amp of
amiodarone 150 mg and 2 amps of bicarbonate 50 mEq. Her
pressures continued to drop and norepinepherine was started for
a systolic pressure in the 60s. This was increased to the
maximum dose with systolic pressures not sustaining in the 90s.
Her initial set of labs returned with persistent lactic acidosis
with a serum bicarbonate of 26 and an svO2 of 57%. Her family
was at the bedside and felt that she would not want to be
intubated again as she was at [**Hospital3 **] prior to
transfer. Her hypotension persisted and vasopressin was added
with no effect on blood pressure. Two more amps of bicarbonate
50 mEq and 1g of calcium chloride were delivered. A femoral
arterial line was attempted. Phenylepherine was added at maximum
dose with only transient blood pressure control. Vancomycin and
piparicillin plus tazobactam were started for presumed sepsis
from an abdominal catastrophe. Her family was called to the
bedside and made her CMO. Her pressors were stopped and she was
placed on a NRB. She received several bolus doses of morphine
for comfort. She expired at 3:40pm on [**2188-11-5**].
.
# Acute hepatitis: AST/ALT trended up dramatically following
admission to [**Location (un) **] and she remained with depressed synthetic
function which is mildly worse
