DATE OF DEATH:  [**2117-4-21**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Increased shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old male with
coronary artery disease, status post recent catheterization
in [**2-21**] with critical AS, atrial fibrillation, GERD who
presented on [**2117-4-21**] to an outside hospital with increased
shortness of breath, exertional dyspnea, and cough with
bloody sputum.  The patient was found to have a right lower
lobe infiltrate at that time and a white blood count of 19.2
consistent with pneumonia and worsening of chronic renal
insufficiency.  BUN and creatinine of 6.5 and 3.2.  Baseline
creatinine was known to be 2.4-2.5.  The patient was given 1
dose of ceftriaxone and 5-day course of azithromycin plus a
14-day course of levofloxacin.  White blood count was [**Last Name (LF) 28645**],
[**First Name3 (LF) **] the patient was started on empiric Flagyl.  Sputum culture
was without significant growth, but chest x-ray was
questionable for new left-sided infiltrate.  However,
clinically the patient improved and was discharged home on
[**2117-4-3**].

At home, the patient was with progressive increasing dyspnea,
reports of subjective fevers, chills, and sweats.  Denies
nausea or vomiting.  No choking or palpitations.  The patient
still with mild blood-tinged sputum, but decreased production
overall.  Denied pleuritic pain, questionable history of
diarrhea with mild abdominal pain, but no constipation.  The
patient states he is taking all medications at home.
Shortness of breath was reported to be at rest, and the
patient re-presented to the outside hospital today.  White
count was found to be 18.  Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe
infiltrate, hematocrit of 28.7.  In the Emergency Department,
the patient's vitals were found to be temperature of 98
degrees, heart rate of 48, blood pressure of 80/60, and 88
percent on room air.  The patient was placed on nonrebreather
with O2 saturations 99 percent.  An ABG at this time was
7.42, 20, and 57.  Lactate from outside hospital was pending.
The patient was given 600 cc bolus of normal saline without
effect and was subsequently started on dopamine and blood
pressure improved to 110/60.  A left IJ was placed at the
outside hospital, and the patient was also given a dose of
Lasix 40 mg x 1, vancomycin 1 g x 1, and imipenem 500 mg.
The patient was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for presumed sepsis.

At [**Hospital1 18**], the vitals found to be temperature of 97 degrees,
heart rate 66, blood pressure 68/16, respiratory rate 24, and
99 percent on nonrebreather.  The patient was given 5 liters
of IV fluid.  Dopamine was continued.  Levophed was initiated
to maintain blood pressure.  The patient was given 500 mg of
levofloxacin and 500 mg of Flagyl.  Hematocrit was found to
be 25.7 (baseline of 31).  The patient was given 2 units of
packed red blood cells, A line was placed.  An ABG at this
time showed pH of 7.30, pCO2 of 26, and paO2 of 77, and
lactate was 1.4.  Chest x-ray was repeated showing left lower
lobe infiltrate.  KUB was performed secondary to nonspecific
abdominal pain showing no free air and 1 dilated loop of
bowel.  The patient was transferred to the MICU for further
care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD, status post catheterization in
[**6-22**] with stent in the right coronary artery with
brachytherapy.
Status post recatheterization in [**3-23**] with re-stent of right
coronary artery with a Cypher stent.
Critical AS with valve area of 0.85 square centimeters.
Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
GERD.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 2.4-
2.5.
Hypertension.
PVD.
Anemia secondary to chronic renal insufficiency.
Question of COPD with bronchospasm, recently on a steroid
taper.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

13.      Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. until [**4-13**].
14.      Prednisone 20 mg on a taper.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with his wife, on
high functional baseline, walks with a cane.  Tobacco, has a
30-pack-year history, but quit 20 years ago.  Drinks alcohol
occasionally.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the MICU, temperature 96.4 degrees,
heart rate 58, blood pressure 105/37, breathing 99 percent on
a 100 percent nonrebreather.  The patient is an elderly male
in mild acute distress, dyspneic with speech, and pale
appearing.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Dry mucous membranes.  No lymphadenopathy.  Heart was
regular.  S1 and S2 appreciated.  Harsh crescendo and
decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Questionable [**1-23**] holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Lungs with
crackles at the bases bilaterally.  Abdomen with good bowel
sounds, soft, distended, and tympanitic.  Unable to
appreciate hepatosplenomegaly.  There were no masses.
Extremities with trace to 1 plus lower edema bilaterally.
Pulses were palpable bilaterally.  Evidence of ecchymosis on
the upper extremities, but no rash.  Neurologically oriented
x 3.  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Moving all
extremities in bed.  Sensation intact.  The patient is
mentating appropriately.

LABS AT PRESENTATION:  White count 18.5, hematocrit 25.7,
platelets 134, BUN 97, creatinine of 3.0, and glucose is 183.

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  EKG showed atrial fibrillation with
left axis, 2-mm ST depressions in V2-V6, T-wave inversions in
1 and aVL.  Again, chest x-ray showed left lower lobe
infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Sepsis, likely secondary to left lower lobe
pneumonia, but consider an additional abdominal process.  The
patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, given IV
fluids, given 4 mg of dexamethasone in the setting of recent
steroid use.  The patient was currently mentating well.
Urine output was stable.  During hospital course, the patient
was started on vancomycin, Zosyn, and given a 5-day course of
azithromycin.  The patient subsequently developed a drug
reaction rash to the Zosyn and was started on imipenem.  The
patient received a 5-day course of azithromycin, 10-day
course of vancomycin, and 10-day course of imipenem.  Micro
data remained negative.  The patient continued to spike
temperatures.  The patient was given fluconazole for evidence
of yeast in the urine as well as sputum.  This was the only
organism that was evident in moderate growth; however, this
was thought to be secondary to re-colonization after use of
broad spectrum antibiotics.  Again, the patient's micro data
remained negative during entire hospitalization.  However,
the patient persisted to have hypotension, which was fluid
responsive; however, the patient was showing marked signs of
volume overload.  The patient was ultimately started on
caspofungin and received 3 days of caspofungin.  The patient
remained afebrile, but again had issues with hypotension.

During this course, the patient underwent Swan-Ganz catheter
placement to determine overall fluid status.  At this time,
CVP was noted to be 12, RA pressures 47/7 and PA pressures
47/20, and respiratory wedge was found to be 14 with a mean
wedge of 18.  Cardiac index at this time was 2.91 and cardiac
output 7.1, SVR 585, and SVO2 of 67.  Physiology was
concerning for sepsis.  Therefore, fluid boluses were used to
maintain blood pressure.  The patient was initiated on
dopamine and subsequently Levophed in the Emergency
Department.  However, during the hospital course, the patient
was transitioned from these pressors over to dobutamine and
vasopressin with improvements in mixed venous saturations.
At the time of death the patient still remained pressor
dependent with no signs of improvement.  Of note, Xigris was
considered early in hospital presentation, however, due to
concerns for bleeding as well
