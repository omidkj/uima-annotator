[**1-9**] CXR PA & LAT: IMPRESSION: Diffuse interstitial changes
with fibrosis, similar in appearance to previous examinations,
and consistent with history of sarcoidosis. No acute change
identified.
.
[**1-10**] Echo: Conclusions:
The cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation with a mean
ventricular rate of
110-120 beats per minute. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.  No atrial septal defect
or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is
low normal (LVEF 50%), probably secondary to atrial
fibrillation. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal.  The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 y/o female with interstitial lung disease
presents with dyspnea and productive cough, likely bronchitis vs
PNA. Her brief hospital course, by problem:
.
# Bronchitis vs. PNA: CXR showed possible infiltrate. She was
treated with Ceftriaxone and azithromycin for two days, then
sent home on Levaquin 500mg QD.
.
# Dyspnea: On home O2 at 2-4 L by tracheal cannula. She
tolerated 6L on transtracheal catheter throughout her admission.

.
# Elevated WBC count: Considered to be steroids vs. stress
reaction vs. infection. Elevated neutrophils on diff without
left shift. A possible pneumonia was treated, cultures were
negative to date, and her WBC decreased by the time of
discharge.
.
# AFib: On EKG and exam. Her beta blocker dosage was changed
from atenolol [**Hospital1 **] to metoprolol 150mg [**Hospital1 **]. Her coumadin was
held; at the time of discharge, it had decreased to 3.5, and she
was instructed to start again the day after discharge and have
it followed up three days after discharge.
.
# HTN: Blood pressure under good control. Atenolol was changed
to metoprolol and increased. She received one day's worth of
diltiazem 30mg QID, but it was discontinued at discharge with
close outpatient follow up.

# Macrocytosis: On B12 and folate. Positive alcohol history.
.
# S/P Thyroidectomy. Levothyroxine was continued.
.
# F/E/N: Heart healthy diet, protonix continued,
supratherapeutic INR, insulin sliding scale while on prednisone
