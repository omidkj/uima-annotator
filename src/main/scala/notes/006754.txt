RLE US IMPRESSION: Patent right popliteal artery with aneurysmal
dilation measuring 2.6 x 2.3 cm with minimal wall thickening.


PMIBI IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion. There is mild
global hypokinesis. EF is 48%.

ECHO Conclusions

The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe atherosclerosis with infrarenal AAA, bilateral iliac,
and left
femoral artery aneurysms.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Mild anasarca.
4. T11 and L1 compression fractures.
5. Cholelithiasis.
6. Right inguinal hernia.


Brief Hospital Course:
After examining the patient it was apparent that he had an
acutely threatened limb.  He was started on anticoagulation with
heparin and transported to the angio suite.  He underwent LLE
angiogram and was found to have a thrombosed popliteal aneursym.
 Angiojet thrombolysis was performed.  Sheath and catheter left
in and he received TPA and heparin infusion overnight.  He
returned to the OR the following day for repeat angiogram and
the peroneal artery was now able to be cannulated.  Thrombolysis
with TPA and heparin were continued again overnight.  Upon
return to the angio suite his angiogram demonstrated flow down
the peroneal into its bifurcation but with slow flow and both
branches occluded in the foot.  The foot was supplied by
collaterals.
.
The following day his foot began to warm up and he had
dopplerable signals in his foot with a strong peroneal signal.
For this reason it was decided his best option was a femoral to
peroneal bypass to salvage his foot.  He was taken to the OR on
[**9-5**] and underwent bypass as well as popliteal aneursym
excision.
.
Patient was transferred back to the CVICU in good condition.  He
was continued on his heparin drip.  He was then transferred to
the VICU for further monitoring.  He initially remained on
bedrest, his leg was wrapped with ACE wrap.
.
On [**9-7**] it was noted his morning Hct was 24.  He received 2
units PRBC and lasix, but continued to be oliguric.  The
following morning his Hct was still 24.  He underwent CT pelvis
to rule out RP bleed, which was negative.  He received another 2
units PRBC with lasix.  His UOP began to improve but his Cr rose
to 1.9.  Renal consult was obtained, urine lytes were checked.
Cardiology was also called because of elevated troponins and EKG
showing ST depressions in anterior and lateral leads.
.
He had a Pmibi stress test which was negative, decision to not
proceed with cardiac cath.  His renal function improved.  He was
prepared for discharge to rehab based on physical therapy
recommendations.  Foley, Aline, and CVL were all removed prior
to discharge.

He is to leave on lovenox / coumadin bridge.
