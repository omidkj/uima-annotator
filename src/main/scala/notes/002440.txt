Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and ICD firing at home

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
defibrillation: 35 J succesfully out of VT

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo man with h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in
[**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
20%, recently discharged from CCU for ICD firing, coming with
recurrant ICD firing. He initially presented on [**2147-8-29**] with
recurrent ICD firing in the setting of sustained VTach and was
admitted to our hospial, where he was loaded with amiodarone and
discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on amiodarone 400 Daily. He was
followed by EP service and it was decided not to pursue ablation
or further hospitalizations given patient preferences and code
status (DNR/DNI). Recently patient was in his normal state of
health until yesterday afternoon, when he had sudden oppressive
substernal chest pain that lasted a 1-2 seconds, that he
charachterized as being "shocked". He felt three more episodes
like this one and decided to come to our ER.
.
His VS were T 98.3 F, BP 110 74 mmHg, HR 76 BPM, RR 20 X', SpO2
99%. He did not receive any medications in the ER and was
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]. A soon as he arrived on the floor he went into
VTach at 150s and code blue was called. Initially his SBP was 88
and improve with trendelenburg. He was mentating well throughout
the episode. Pads were put in place, but patient ATPx3 and then
shocked 35 J succesfully out of his VT. He received 150 mg of IV
amiodarone x1. He was transfered to the ICU for further care.
.
In the ICU he had another episode. Amiodarone 150 mg IV x1 and
then infusion at 1 mg/min was started, metoprolol 5 mg IV x1 and
then 25 mg of PO metoprolol. Attending was notified and it was
discussed with team that knows him that he has been DNR/DNI in
the past and that he was made "do not hospitalized". Multiple
attempts to contact the family were unsuccessfull.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He does endorses recent constipation for the past two days.  All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion (though poor exercise capacity), paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo man with h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in
[**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns
with recurrent VT on PO amiodarone.
.
#. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD, presented due to
ICD firing.  Patient went into VT and defibrillated to sinus
with 35 J on this admission in the ED.  He is on amiodarone at
home and was bolused. He was also initially kept on IV lidocaine
gtt. Patient was kept on telemetry, had a short run of VT, which
resolved, and was not noted to have further events.  On prior
admission, extensive discussion with patient, family, and
cardiology physicians took place, where patient refused
ablation, and corroborated DNR/DNI status.  Patient stated that
he does not want CPR, shocks, intubation.  During this
admission, we were not able to reach family despite multiple
attempts. Patient does not wish to pursue aggressive care, and
is NOT TO BE SHOCKED unless his code status changes. We
recommend that a family meeting be called when his family is
home to discuss goals of care and possibly a "do not
hospitalize" plan. He does not wish to have his ICD turned off
at this time or to pursue an ablation.
.
#. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic
systolic heart failure with EF of 20%.  He was continued on
statin, ASA, and metoprolol.  ACEi and Lasix were held in
setting of hypotension but Lasix was restarted at previous dose
at discharge. Please restart Captopril as BP allows.
.
#. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than
his VT and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.
ACEi held as above, due to hypotension.
.
#. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol and oxycodone.
.
# Low grade temperature: T max 100.4 PO on [**2147-9-20**]. WBC is flat,
temp [**Month (only) **] to 98 without Tylenol. BC, urine CX is pending at time
of this summary. Urinalysis is negative. CXR shows no acute
process. Mild fever likely [**3-20**] atelectasis and immobility. No
further workup is warranted unless temp rises again.
#. Anxiety - Continued on Ativan home-dose.
.
#. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be shocked.  Has declined
ablation therapy.
