Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
45 year old male with history of severe asthma requiring
numerous hospitalizations and intubations in the past, now
re-presenting with recurrent dyspnea and cough for 2 days.  His
productive cough started about 2 days ago, in the absence of any
other URI symptoms.  His shortness of breath began yesterday,
for which he usually tries his nebulizer and a Z-pack.  His
nebulizer machine was not working overnight, he actually went to
work the next day and he called [**Company 191**] in the morning to try to get
another script to replace it.  When this did not work, he drove
himself from work to the pharmacy to pick one up and then gave
himself a treatment on the way home.  Before he got a chance to
take his high-dose prednisone, he decided to come to the ED.  He
has been taking 50mg prednisone in a slow taper, but the goal
dose was 30mg every other day until he was able to get off
steroids entirely.
.
He was previously discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after a similar
presentation and ICU admission, felt to be consistent with a
combination of asthma and COPD exacerbations.  He received
albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6h with clinical improvement in
wheezing, azithromycin for antibiotic coverage, and was
discharged on a prednisone taper to be determined by his
outpatient pulmonologist, Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Prior peak flows
were 350 on [**8-24**] and 300 on [**8-25**].  Prior admissions this year
have followed a similar pattern, none of which have required
intubations and have lasted 1-2 days.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 101.4, 137, 148/127, 92% on 4L
O2.  He received solumedrol 125mg IV, Magnesium 2g IV, Cefepime
1g IV, Levofloxacin 750mg IV, Combivent + albuterol nebs, and 1g
tylenol for fever.  Given his continued tachypnea and
tachycardia as well as his prior history of severe asthma, the
decision was made to admit him to the ICU for further
monitoring.  On transfer to the MICU, vitals were: Sats 91% RA,
RR 28, HR 120, BP 121/102 (151/96 prior).
.
On arrival to the MICU, he is still very wheezy, but comfortable
on RA.
.
