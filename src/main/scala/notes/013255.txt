Date of Birth:   [**2038-10-25**]     Sex:  M

Service:  C-MEDICINE

The patient was admitted to C-Medicine with subsequent
transfer to CCU, with subsequent transfer back to C-Medicine,
with subsequent transfer to Cardiothoracic Surgery, and
subsequent transfer back to C-Medicine prior to discharge.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Presenting for right heart catheterization
and Swan-Ganz placement for inotropic therapy, INR 3.4.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year old male with
congestive heart failure secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy
with ejection fraction less than 15% with the following
baseline:  no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no
palpitations, no nausea, vomiting, no diaphoresis although
the patient states that he stays at home and performs very
limited activity.  The patient denies orthopnea, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema as well and tries to walk on a
treadmill fifteen minutes a day.  The patient gets up
frequently at night to urinate.

Over the past one month, the patient has been feeling dizzy
and having episodes of syncope as well as near syncope.  He
has been defibrillated about five times by his AICD.  He has
been generally feeling much weaker though still without
shortness of breath, chest pain, edema or orthopnea.  The
patient adheres to his low sodium diet and is compliant with
his medications.  The patient also mentions that he has had
two urinary tract infections in the past one month with
frequent nocturia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction less than
15%.  The patient had two myocardial infarctions in the late
[**2087**] and sustained a cardiac arrest secondary to torsades
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 29185**] developing into ventricular fibrillation.
2.  Status post DDD pacer and AICD placement.
3.  Superior vena cava thrombus.
4.  Mild left monocular blindness.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  "Lazy esophagus".
8.  Likely benign prostatic hypertrophy with two urinary
tract infections in the past one month.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Prevacid 40 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Carvedilol 3.125 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Folic Acid 1 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Lasix 10 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d.
8.  Enteric Coated Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
9.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. with 7.5 mg every third night
instead of 5 mg.
10. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. twice a day for one month and then
400 mg p.o. once daily.

ALLERGIES:  Aldactone causes hyperkalemia and acute renal
failure.  The patient is also allergic to Penicillin.

Most recent cardiac catheterization [**2109-11-1**], showed a left
circumflex occluded after the OM1 which was patent.  The left
main was normal. Left anterior descending and right coronary
artery with mild luminal irregularities; mean right atrial
pressure 12, right ventricular end diastolic pressure 22,
pulmonary artery pressure 54/30. Pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure 28, cardiac index 1.7.

Last echocardiogram [**2109-5-6**], left ventricle severely
dilated, severe left ventricular global hypokinesis, ejection
fraction less than 15%, left atrium mildly dilated, right
ventricle mildly dilated, global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate to severe
mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile with vital
signs stable and normal.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination - No icterus and no pallor.  Mucous membranes are
moist.  In general, a very thin chronically ill appearing
male who appears very weak but who is in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  No jugular venous distention, no edema.  There is a
systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
Pulmonary - The lungs are clear to auscultation.  The abdomen
is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Neurologically, cranial
nerves II through XII are intact.  No sensory or motor
deficits.  Speech and gait are intact although the patient
seems to have difficulty with his memory and frequently
instructs the interviewer to refer to his wife for answers to
several questions.  The patient is alert and oriented times
three.  Coordination is intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent data on admission includes the
hematocrit 34.5, platelet count 222,000, blood urea nitrogen
20, creatinine 1.2.  Digoxin level 0.7.  INR 3.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to C-Medicine and
placed on telemetry.  His Coumadin was held and he was
administered p.o. Vitamin K to reverse his INR in
anticipation of interventional procedures.  He was kept on
his sodium restricted diet.  His INR rapidly reversed to less
than 1.5 and he was first taken for a noninvasive
electrophysiological study (NIPS) by electrophysiology which
demonstrated functional devices but also showed possible
occlusion of the superior vena cava and subclavian
vasculature.  Follow-up ultrasounds of both upper extremities
showed the bilateral internal jugulars, subclavians and
axillaries to be patent with but with sluggish flow on the
left side.  The superior vena cava could not be visualized on
this study.  The patient was next transferred to the CCU
where a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed under fluoroscopy
through a femoral vein because of inability to pass this
through an internal jugular.  Tailored Inotropic therapy was
begun with Dobutamine for two days.  The patient tolerated
this therapy well but he did not symptomatically improve.
The patient was then transferred back to the C-Medicine
service where he was continued on a Dobutamine drip on the
floor for several more days without any improvement in his
clinical status.  The patient was next taken for an attempted
biventricular pacer upgrade but the procedure was
unsuccessful because of an occluded superior vena cava which
allowed blood flow around the thrombus through either an
azygous vein or collaterals but did not allow pacer wires to
be inserted.  It should be noted at this point that the
patient was kept on Heparin during this hospitalization so
that he might maintain anticoagulation while not receiving
his Coumadin and that anticoagulation may be rapidly reversed
when the drip is shut off prior to each procedure.
