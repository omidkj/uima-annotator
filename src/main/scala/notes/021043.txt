Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
laparoscopic cholecystectomy

History of Present Illness:
This 86-year-old gentleman recently presented with a bad flareup
of acute cholecystitis which put him in the hospital at [**Hospital1 3343**] for a number of days back in [**Month (only) 359**].  He admits to
having a 20-year history of abdominal pain with known
gallstones.  He is a diabetic. He also has a cardiac history
including coronary artery bypass graft with anticoagulation for
atrial fibrillation.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] met Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his family in my office and
discussed the fact that he has recurrent problems and symptoms
from known gallstones.  He has not yet had an ERCP although an
EUS showed that he has no evidence of stones in his bile duct.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] indicated that a laparoscopic cholecystectomy would
be indicated for his [**Last Name **] problem in that this has become quite
symptomatic for him.  I did tell him that this would be a bit
risky due to his age as well as his cardiac comorbidities and
the fact that he is on anticoagulation.  The risks and benefits
were discussed. He understood these risks and wished to proceed,
and provided informed consent to that effect.

sign.  His CABG incision goes down into the epigastrium.  There

region.  A rectal exam was deferred today.  The rest of his
physical exam is normal.  His cardiac exam shows an irregular
rhythm.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 2829**] Pancreaticobiliary
Surgery Service on [**2133-2-3**] and underwent laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. He tolerated the procedure well, but his
post-operative course was complicated by respiratory distress in
the PACU requiring reintubation and admission to the Surgical
ICU. After transfer to the ICU, he was weaned from the vent and
then extubated and subsequently transferred to the floor. The
rest of his post-operative course was uneventful, however, due
to his age, comorbidities and the stress of the surgery, he
required a number of days to recover. During that time, he was
transitioned off of IV fluids and his diet was advanced. His
pain was well controlled on oral medications. Due to his low
ejection fraction and the fluid shifts of surgery, the patient's
weight had increased from a baseline of the low 130s to the mid
140 lb range.

Thus, on POD 5, in consultation with his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 665**], the
patient was transferred to the Cardiology service for management
of his fluid overload secondary to his congestive heart failure
in the setting of a surgical intervention and the associated
fluid shifts.

On the cardiology service he was diuresed with 80mg IV lasix,
followed by a lasix drip at 10mg/hr.  He tolerated diuresis
well, with no signs of hemodynamic compromise.  He self-reported
his dry weight to be 135 lbs.  On transfer he was at 68kgs
(150lbs) with pitting posterior thigh and buttock edema.  His
creatinine rose slightly to 1.6, but came down to 1.4 prior to
discharge.  His weight was approximately 64kgs (140lbs) at the
time of discharge.  He was returned to his previous home dose of
80mg once a day, to be titrated as needed to maintain his
weight.

The patient had mild abdominal pain post-surgically, that
worsened [**2133-2-12**].  He was found to have low pelvic pain.  He had
been having small, frequent urination while being diuresed.  A
foley catheter was placed, draining 800ccs of urine with
resolution of his pain.  The foley catheter was left in place
and he was started on Flomax (tamsulosin).  He will follow up
with urology to do an outpatient voiding trial [**2133-2-25**] after his
bladder has had time to recover.

In the setting of his urinary retention, a UA and urine culture
were checked.  The UA was equivocal (mildly elevated WBCs but no
bacteria).  The culture grew >100,000 colonies of enterococcus
and the patient later complained of slight burning with his
foley catheter.  He was started on amoxicillin 875mg Q12 hours
for a 14-day course.

The patient has atrial fibrillation, s/p pacer placement and AV
junction ablation.  He restarted coumadin post-op with a lovenox
bridge.  Once his INR was stably over 2.0, his lovenox was
stopped. Prior to discharge his INR was 2.7, and his goal INR
has been 1.5-2.5 because of bleeding complications. He was
discharged on a half dose of Coumadin (1.25mg daily) and will
follow-up with the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 197**] clinic.

He will follow-up in Dr.[**Name (NI) 2829**] clinic in three weeks for a
post-op check.  He had staples in his scalp from a fall prior to
discharge.  The staples were removed and steri-strips placed.
He was seen by physical therapy who felt he could walk well,
even with a foley bag in place.
