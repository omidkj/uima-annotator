Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old patient,
who has a known history of coronary artery disease and has
undergone multiple PTCA stents and PCIs in the last year, who
underwent placement of a stent in his proximal left anterior
descending artery on [**2190-6-9**].

On [**2190-6-14**], the patient was at home and began experiencing
angina and called his cardiologist.  On [**2190-6-16**], was
referred to the Emergency Room.  The patient presented to the
Emergency Room on [**2190-6-16**] and was admitted for workup.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Status post circumflex and left anterior descending artery
stenting.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Hypertension.
5. History of Bell's palsy.
6. Status post hernia repair.
7. Positive tobacco use greater than 30 pack year history.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1. Mavik 4 mg po q day.
2. Cardura 4 mg po q day.
3. Lipitor 40 mg po q day.
4. Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
5. Atenolol 50 mg po q day.
6. Folate.
7. Multivitamins.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Emergency
Room.  Vital signs in the Emergency Room:  Temperature 97.5,
pulse 69.  Regular, rate, and rhythm.  Blood pressure 93/51,
respiratory rate 17, oxygen saturation 97%.  Patient was
awake, alert, and oriented times three in no apparent
distress.  Pain level upon arrival was [**1-1**].  Lungs were
clear.  Heart was regular.  Abdomen was soft, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities were without edema.

Cardiology was consulted.  The patient was taken to the
Catheterization Laboratory.  In the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory, the patient was found to have elevated filling
pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 19.
The left main coronary artery showed severe 90% eccentric
narrowing of entire length.  The stent to the left anterior
descending artery was patent.  The stent to the left
circumflex was patent, and the right coronary artery showed
chronic total occlusion which was unchanged.  An intra-aortic
balloon pump was inserted and Cardiac Surgery was consulted.

The patient had an echocardiogram which showed mild aortic
stenosis with a valve area of 1.3.  An ejection fraction of
40-45%, an aortic valve peak gradient of 38 mm Hg and a mean
gradient of 24 mm Hg.  Patient was taken to the operating
room from the Catheterization Laboratory due to the severe
nature of his left main disease with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**].

The patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x3 with
LIMA to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft
to PDA, and OM sequential, as well as an aortic valve
replacement with a 21 mm bovine [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
pericardial valve on [**2190-6-16**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**].  Please
see operative note for further details.

The patient was transferred from the operating room to the
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.  Upon admission to
the Intensive Care Unit, patient was mildly hypoxic with a
respiratory acidosis and the patient remained intubated
overnight.  On postoperative day #1, the patient was weaned
and extubated from mechanical ventilation.

Preoperatively, the patient had been noted to have a large
hematoma in his right groin from his cardiac catheterization
one week later, and had been reported to have an audible
bruit.  A vascular ultrasound was obtained which showed no
evidence of pseudoaneurysm or A-V fistula in his right groin.
A Vascular consult was attained.  The Vascular team decided
that no treatment was necessary of the hematoma, however,
patient did report to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the Vascular surgeon that
he did have symptoms of claudication.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] suggested
that the patient see him in the office for followup for his
claudication.

On postoperative day #1, patient spiked a fever to 101.  The
patient was pancultured.  The results of the cultures
subsequently had been negative, and patient's temperature
defervesced and had no further temperature spikes.  Patient's
balloon pump was weaned and removed on postoperative day #1
without complication.

On the evening of postoperative day #1, it was noted that the
patient had progressively decreasing urine output with
significant oliguria.  Patient's Foley catheter was flushed
without difficulty.  Patient had little response to Lasix in
volume.  Patient was noted to have distended bladder.  Foley
catheter was replaced with over a liter of urine output
noted.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was noted to be
progressively hypoxic, and thought to be due to the volume
challenge the patient had received when he was thought to be
oliguric.  The patient was given aggressive diuretic therapy
with good improvement in his oxygenation as well as
aggressive pulmonary toilet.

Patient continued to need low dosed Neo-Synephrine to
maintain adequate blood pressure.  On postoperative day #2,
patient had episode of rapid atrial fibrillation, started on
IV amiodarone.  Rate was controlled with IV amiodarone and
Lopressor.  Patient began working with Physical Therapy and
ambulating.

On postoperative day #3, the patient continued to have
episodes of atrial fibrillation.  Rate was controlled with
Lopressor.  Patient's oxygenation improved dramatically, and
was able to be weaned down to nasal cannula.  Patient's chest
tubes were removed without incident.

Patient, on postoperative day #3, was noted to have some
serosanguinous drainage coming from the distal portion of his
sternum.  The area was clean and Dermabond was applied.  The
patient was noted to have elevated white blood cell count of
27,000.  Patient was empirically started on
levofloxacin/Vancomycin.

On postoperative day #4, the drainage from the lower portion
of the sternum had significantly decreased.  Patient's white
blood cell count continued to be elevated, however, patient
remained afebrile.  Patient continued on the antibiotics.

On postoperative day #5, the patient was transferred from the
Intensive Care Unit to the floor.  Patient's white blood cell
count had dropped to 16.8.  Patient was started on Coumadin
and Heparin to anticoagulate for his continued episodes of
atrial fibrillation.

On postoperative day #6, the Heparin drip was discontinued.
Coumadin dosing continued.  His sterile drainage had stopped
and on postoperative day #7, patient was cleared for
discharge to rehabilitation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature max 97.1, pulse 67,
sinus rhythm, although the patient has had multiple episodes
of atrial fibrillation, blood pressure 110/60, respiratory
rate 16, on room air oxygen saturation of 97%.  Weight on
[**6-23**] is 98.2 kg.  The patient weighed 97 kg preoperatively.

rate, and rhythm, positive rub, no murmur.  Lungs are clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
