Admission Date:  [**2166-11-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2166-11-19**]


Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old
male with known coronary artery disease, status post inferior
myocardial infarction in [**2156**] presenting with two weeks of
shortness of breath with cough and chest discomfort.  At the
outside hospital, white blood count was 14 with 27% bands,
creatinine kinase and troponin I were elevated.
The diagnosis of pneumia was made. Electrocardiogram was
consistent with anterior ST changes.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**].  At Emergency Department Cardiology was consulted and
he was felt to be ruling in for anterior myocardial
infarction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  98.7, 86/52, 83, 95% on room air,
respiratory rate 14.  Neck:  No jugulovenous distension.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Pulmonary:  Bibasilar crackles, right greater than
left.  Extremities:  No edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed white
blood count 12.5, creatinine kinase 301, MB fraction 11,
index 3.7, creatinine 1.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**11-5**] as
above to the Cardiac Service.  He was started on Metoprolol
25.5 b.i.d., ACE inhibitor and sputum cultures were sent.
The patient was brought to catheterization on [**2166-11-5**] which showed left anterior descending occlusion of 20%,
main coronary artery occlusion of 70%, and left circumflex
with moderate stenosis and a totally occluded right coronary
artery with left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%.  Four
vessel disease precluded percutaneous coronary angioplasty.
Cardiothoracic Surgery Service was consulted.  The risks and
benefits of coronary artery bypass graft were explained to
the patient in detail.  In the interim, his medical problems
were treated which included the administration of
antibiotics for pneumonia, transfusion for a low hematocrit
from chronic
anemia.  The patient was brought to the Operating Room on
[**11-11**], where three vessel coronary artery bypass graft
was performed (left internal mammary artery to ramus,
saphenous vein graft to distal left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal).  He tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  On postoperative day #2 the patient had
minimal but present left-sided weakness and neurological
consult was obtained.
Computerized tomography scan showed a small bleed in the
parietal occipital area.  His weakness has since resolved
rapidly and the patient is currently at baseline.  The patient
remains on Levofloxacin for prophylaxis of pneumonia secondary
to atelectasis.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Excellent.

FOLLOW UP PLAN:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in four weeks and follow up with his primary care physician
in one week.
Diagnosis: CAD sp CABG, pneumonia, blood loss anemia and
anemia of chronic illness, congestive heart failure.
