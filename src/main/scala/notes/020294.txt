History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home
oxygen, moderate to severe aortic stenosis and diastolic heart
failure who presented to [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive
dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum.  She
was initially treated for presumed COPD exacerbation with IV
solumedrol, levofloxacin and nebulizers.  She initially refused
non-invasive and invasive ventilation.  She developed
progressive hypercarbia despite ultimate initiation of
non-invasive ventilation and suffered PEA arrest on [**2120-1-1**].
ABG during her arrest was 7.07/113/172 and she was intubated.
She required one round of epinephrine and atropine as well as
CPR and regained spontaneous circulation.  She did not require
defibrilation.  She had a femoral line placed after her arrest
as well as an arterial line.  After the arrest she underwent CT
torso which was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed an
unstable T11 fracture with evidence of hemorrhage.  She also
underwent CT head which showed no acute signs of hemorrhage.
She initially was started on lovenox given concern for possible
pulmonary embolism and elevated troponin after the arrest but
developed bleeding from her right ear as well as from her OGT
and this was discontinued.  Prior to transfer her antibiotic
regimen was switched to ceftriaxone from levofloxacin for
ciprofloxacin resistent e. coli in her urine.  She also
transiently required levophed after her cardiac arrest but this
was discontinued on the morning of the day of transfer.  She is
transferred for orthopedic evaluation of her unstable T11
fracture.
.
On arrival to the ICU she is intubated and sedated.  Review of
systems unable to be obtained.
