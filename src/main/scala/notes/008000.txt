CT Pelvis ([**2188-7-9**]) - Long indurated track extending anteriorly
from the posterior gluteal fold.  Foci of air in the most
posterior aspect - likely corresponding to area of drainage seen
on physical exam - correlate clinically.  About 3.5 cm superior
to above mentioned are -- fat stranding in the fascia and soft
tissues of the left labia -- c/w cellulitis. No drainable
abscess collection.  Single foci of air in the anterior midline
at the superficia labial fold.




Brief Hospital Course:
The patient initially looked well and was admitted to the floor
and treated with vanocmycin and clindamycin.  Her cellulitis
initially improved but on the morning of [**2188-7-12**] it was noted to
be worsened.  She also developed oliguria with an increasing
creatinine.  She was taken to the operating room and underwent
incision and drainage of debridement of perineum and lower left
abdominal wall (see operative report for full details).

She was admitted to the SICU post-operatively.  She remained
intubated an on pressors.  Aztreonam was initially added to her
antibiotics regimen of vancomycin and clindamycin.  She then
underwent zosyn desensitization protocol as she is penicillin
allergic.  Aztreonam was discontinued and replaced with zosyn.

On [**7-14**] the was transfused 1u PRBC for a Hct of 22.8.  Trophic
TF were started and pressors were weaned to off.  She underwent
a bedside echo which was stable.

On [**7-16**] her antibiotics were narrowed to just Zosyn for
treatment of pan-sensitive pseudomonas which grew out of her
wound.  Her TF were advanced.

On [**7-17**] she was stable for transfer to the floor.  Over the next
few days dressing changes were continued and her cellulitis
improved on zosyn.  She remained stable and we had planned to
send her to rehab on [**7-19**].  However that morning she was noted
to have increased melena and a Hct from from 24.0 to 19.5.
Given this new issue and marked nursing concern she was
transferred to the Trauma ICU.

After transfer to the unit on [**7-20**] she was given another 2u of
PRBC with lasix for increased respiratory distress.  NG lavage
was done with bloody output, with small clots and coffee
grounds. She was seen by GI and intubated for an upper
endoscopy.  She developed hypotension after intubated and was
briefly on pressors.  Another 2u PRBC were transfused and she
was weaned off pressors.  Upper endoscopy demonstrated a
duodenal ulcer which was not bleeding.  A left subclavian line
was attempted which resulted in a pneumothorax, which was
treated with a pigtail catheter.  She was able to be extubated
after endoscopy.  She was maintained on a protonix drip.

[**7-21**]: She was transferred to the regular floor.  Her Hct
remained stable and she was bolused with lasix for fluid
overload.  Her pigtail catheter was removed after CXR showed
resolution of her pneumothorax.  To further evaluate her
decreasing hematocrit, she underwent an EDG on [**7-24**] which showed
a small hiatal hernia, and the duodenal ulcer which was not
actively bleeding.  She was placed on intravenous PPI's for 72
hours.  Her hematocrit stabllized after the last unit packed red
blood cells on [**7-25**].  She resumed a regular diet and continued
on oral PPI's.  Over the next 24-48 hours, her lab work was
monitored.  She was repo
