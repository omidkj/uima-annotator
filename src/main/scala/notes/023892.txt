History of Present Illness:

81 yo who mostly gets care at [**Hospital1 3278**], discharged from [**Hospital1 3278**] to
[**Last Name (un) **] yesterday. This morning was found down by NH with
glucose 25. He has a
history of diabetes and is on 10mg glipizide, and insulin. He
received 2 amps of glucagon before arrival to [**Hospital1 **]. Vitals on
arrival 97 66 178/83 16 98%. BS maintained in the 20s. An amp of
glucose was given which brought up his sugar to 78 and then 107.
1.5 hours later, BS was 50. He was placed on D5 gtt and given SC
octreotide for possible sufonyl urea toxicity. Given his altered
mental status, neurology was called to evaluate and felt that
stoke unlikely with exam and INR 4.5. His troponin was elevated
and cardiology was called to review ECG which they did not feel
was concerning. On transfer, vitals were 88 112/57 24 100 2L NC.

.
Regarding his recent medical history, he has bounced back and
forth between [**Hospital1 **] and rehab. His mental status appears to be
at recent baseline. According to nursing staff at [**Last Name (un) **], he
has no close family. He is dependent on others for all
activities of daily living including feeding. He has very
minimal speech output.

.
Imaging:
CT scan head [**2181-4-7**]:
1. No acute intracranial process. Chronic involutional changes.
2. Moderate paranasal sinus disease.
.
CXR [**2181-4-7**]: Lung volumes are slightly low with crowding of the
bronchovasculature in the lower lungs, especially right
perihilar. A
developing pneumonia in the RML is difficult to exclude. No
pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present. The cardiac
silhouette is top normal in size. Hilar and mediastinal contours
appear normal.

LEUS:
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus seen within the right
popliteal vein
consistent with the known DVT. No additional thrombus seen in
the deep veins
of both legs. Note is made that the calf veins could not be
imaged.

EEG [**4-9**]:
Prelminary report shows diffuse slowing consistent with a
metabolic encephalopathy, no spikes concerning for epileptiform
activity.

CT Chest and Abdomen [**4-9**]:
Final Report
EXAMINATION: CT of the torso with intravenous and oral contrast.


INDICATION: 81-year-old male with significant decline in mental
status over
the last two months with a negative head CT. Known history of
COPD. Found to
have a right breast chest wall mass. Hypoalbuminemia and
coagulopathy.

COMPARISONS: Chest radiograph [**2181-4-9**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT examination was performed from the
upper abdomen.
Subsequently, 130 cc of intravenous contrast was administered
and axial MDCT
was performed from the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis.
Subsequently,
three-minute delays were obtained through the upper abdomen. No
oral contrast
was administered. Sagittal and coronal reformats were generated
and reviewed.

FINDINGS:

CT OF THE CHEST: Within the left thyroid gland, a 17-mm
hypoattenuating
lesion is seen. The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber and
opacification.
Mild calcific atherosclerosis of the arch. Central pulmonary
arteries are
patent. The heart is normal in size. No pericardial effusion.
Mild
atherosclerosis of the coronary artery. No significant
mediastinal or hilar
adenopathy. Subcentimeter subcarinal, right hilar, paratracheal
nodes are
seen.

On lung windows, there are small scattered pulmonary blebs. Mild
biapical
scarring. Respiratory motion precludes evaluation of fine
pulmonary nodules.
No lung parenchymal masses, effusions, or pneumothorax. Patchy
opacities at
the right lung base and linear opacities at the left lung base
likely
represent atelectasis or scar. The central airway is patent.

Subcentimeter axillary lymph nodes are seen bilaterally. No
discrete right
breast or right chest wall mass is seen. There is
induration/hazy stranding
of the subcutaneous fat involving the right lateral and right
flank. This
appears slightly asymmetric. No abnormal enhancement in this
region.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Tiny hypodensities in segment VI of the liver
(series 3,
image 60), most likely a cyst but too small to further
characterize. Liver
otherwise enhances normally without intrahepatic or extrahepatic
biliary
ductal dilatation. Portal and hepatic veins are patent. The
gallbladder
contains small stones in the dependent aspect. No
pericholecystic fluid or
adjacent inflammatory changes. Pancreas is mildly atrophic. No
peripancreatic
inflammatory changes or main pancreatic ductal dilatation. The
spleen is
normal in size and opacification. The adrenal glands are
unremarkable
bilaterally. The kidneys appear symmetric with preserved
corticomedullary
differentiation. No hydronephrosis, hydroureter, or
ureterolithiasis. No
perinephric fluid collections. Nonspecific bilateral perinephric
stranding.
There is no significant retroperitoneal adenopathy. The
abdominal aorta is
normal in caliber and opacification. Mild calcific
atherosclerosis of the
infrarenal aorta. Branch vessels normally opacify.

Unopacified bowel loops are collapsed but unremarkable in
caliber. No
significant mesenteric edema, mesenteric lymph nodes, abnormal
fluid
collections, or free air. Extensive right and left colonic
diverticulosis
without evidence for diverticulitis. Normal air-filled appendix
in the right
lower quadrant.

There is diastasis of the rectus abdominis in the periumbilical
region with a
defect measuring up to 3.3 cm transversely. There is omental fat
in the
defect. Non-obstructive transverse colon and nonobstructive
small bowel loops
are also seen in this region.

CT OF THE PELVIS: Decompressed urinary bladder with foley,
contains
nondependent air likely related to instrumentation. Prostate,
seminal
vesicles appear unremarkable. Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis
without
diverticulitis. No free fluid in the pelvis. No significant
pelvic or
inguinal adenopathy by size criteria. Multiple bilateral
subcentimeter
inguinal lymph nodes are seen, none appearing pathologically
enlarged. One
lymph node is seen within the right inguinal canal fat.

Bones: No destructive osseous lesions. Multilevel degenerative
changes of the
visualized spine. Mild grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 in relation
to S1.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute process within the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
2. Mild s
