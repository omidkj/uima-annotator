phone.  She found her naked and on the floor, unable to rise.
EMS called, checked BP / temperature and thought she was okay to
go to PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] went home but then returned approximately
3pm and found her half-out of bed, very weak and appearing
unwell.  This time she also called EMS and she was then brought
to [**Hospital1 18**].  Of note, pt recently had a similar episode in [**11-19**]

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the MICU in critical condition, with
multisystem organ failure. She was intubated and hypotensive,
requiring pressors to maintain blood pressure. There was
evidence of significnt pneumonia, and the patient was found to
be Influenza B positive. She was treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics, as well as Tamiflu. A temporary dialysis line was
placed and the patient received CVVH. The lactic acidosis
persisted despite these interventions.  Additionally, she
required continued pressor support and continued to have a
positive fluid balance daily.  Given her failure to improve and
inability to wean from pressor support, a family meeting was
held to discuss goals of care.  After this meeting, the decision
was made to withdraw aggressive support, as this would be in
line with the patient's wishes.  Subsequently, support was
withdrawn and she died with her family at her bedside.
