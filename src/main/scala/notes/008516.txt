Radiology
[**2155-2-20**] Chest PA & L
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with atypical infection.
.
[**2155-2-21**] Portable CXR
Severe, somewhat irregular peribronchovascular infiltration of
both lungs with a strong nodular component has progressed
significantly over approximately 12 hours. Heart size is normal.
There is no evidence of vascular congestion. Findings are most
likely due to a disseminated infection or drug reaction or,
depending upon clinical circumstances, pulmonary hemorrhage.
.
CXR [**2-28**]: Interval worsening of interstitial pulmonary edema.
Slight
improvement in multifocal patchy areas of consolidation, likely
due to atypical opportunistic infection.
.
sputum [**2-25**]: yeast
blood cx [**2-25**]: NGTD

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxia: The patient was noted to be hypoxic to 88% on room
air in the ER with symptoms concerning for influenza or other
viral illness. CXR showed bilateral patchy increased prominence
of interstitial markings, concerning for an atypical pneumonia.
The patient was started on Levaquin.  She received supplemental
oxygen and albuterol nebluizers. B ased on the patient's
clinical symptoms of fevers, chills, myalgias, arthralgias, and
non-productive cough, there was concern for influenza and she
was started on Tamiflu.  She was transferred to the MICU on [**2-21**]
for respiratory distress and hypoxia and was electively
intubated.  She was continued on levofloxacin and tamiflu.
Vanco, bactrim, and prednisone were added for possible PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].  She also underwent bronchoscopy and BAL, which were
unrevealing.  HIV consent was obtained and returned negative.
Rapid viral tests returned positive for influenza.  She was
extubated [**2-27**] and was weaned off supplemental oxygen.  Repeat
CXR showed pulmonary edema but the patient auto-diuresed well on
the floor.  She was continued on flovent and prn nebulizers.
She worked with PT, who deemed her safe to return home with home
PT.
.
2. HTN: The patient's blood pressure was controlled with
lisinopril on the floor. In the unit, lisinopril was held for
hypotensive episodes and elevated creatinine.  Metoprolol was
added for better control.  She was discharged on both
medications.
.
3. Diabetes: She was continued on her home dosing of NPH 30Qam
and 8Qpm with ISS on the floor.  While in the unit, she was
placed on insulin gtt for better glucose control.  Back on the
floor her NPH doses were titrated up as the patient's PO intake
improved.  She requested a referral to [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.

.
4. The patient was hypernatremic which was treated with D5W.
Her Na level returned to [**Location 213**] once she was taking POs.

5. The patient received a diabetic diet as tolerated, tubefeeds
via OG tube when intubated.  She also received heparin SC for
DVT prophylaxis.
