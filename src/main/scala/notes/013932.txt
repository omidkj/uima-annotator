Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12997**] is a [**Age over 90 **]F with a history of CAD, chronic sCHF,
Alzheimer's vs. vascular dementia and a recent admission for
BRBPR who presented to the ED today with rib pain after a fall.
She isn't sure exactly what happened, but says she was carrying
a bowl of oatmeal and a cup of coffee and thinks she burned her
finger, dropped the bowl and fell. No LOC. Did hit her chin,
which is bruised. She denies any further BRBPR since her last
admission. She claims to have been having regular BMs since
discharge w/o increase in frequency.
.
In the ED her HCT was notably 19. She was mentating at her
baseline at that time. CT Chest revealed new pneumomediasteinum
thoracics was consulted felt that this finding could most likely
be explained by popped pulmonary bleb after the fall that then
tracted to the mediastinum. They did not feel a surgical
intervention was warranted. She was admitted to the MICU for
monitoring. She was transfused 2 units PRBC HCT 19->28 and has
remained stable now X 3 blood draws. Her stool has been GUIAC
Negative in the MICU.
.
Of note, she has had two recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] for GIB, one
at the end of [**Month (only) 1096**] and one earlier this month from
[**Date range (1) 32840**]. At the [**Month (only) 1096**] admission, she declined colonoscopy
but underwent CT abd/pelvis which showed mild focal thickening
of the sigmoid colon suggestive of a inflammatory or infectious
colitis. She then underwent flex sig examination which showed
grade 1 internal hemmrhoids but was otherwise normal (no
evidence of bleeding). Bleeding was attributed to known
diverticulosis or possibly to hemorrhoids. During her second
admission, 2 transfusions were attempted (the first was stopped
halfway due to a blown IV, the second was stopped after 1 hour
due to an asymptomatic low-grade fever of 100.6). Hct ultimately
rebounded to 30 and she was discharged home.
.
Prior to transfer, pt sitting in chair comfortable not in pain.
The pt has not noted any bleeding in stool. Denies CP, SOB,
LH/Dizziness.

IMAGING:
CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. No displaced fracture, however, if clinical concern for
fracture persists of the ribs, suggest dedicated rib series,
which is more sensitive.
2. Persistent severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and
small
bilateral pleural effusions.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). Left ventricular wall thickness and cavity
size are normal with low normal global systolic function (LVEF
50-55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a
small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. No evidence of
pneumopericardium is identified.
IMPRESSION: Normal leftventricular cavity sizes with preserved
regional and low normal global systolic function. Severe mitral
regurgitation. Moderate to severe pulmonary artery
hypertensionl. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free
wall hypokinesis. Small to moderate circumferential pericardial
effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromised (may be
absent in the setting of pulmonary artery hypertension).
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-1-29**], the
pericardial effusion is slightly larger. The other findings are
similar.
.
CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Trace air tracking through the anterior chest wall into
retrosternal space without sternal fracture extending into
apparently the anterior pericardium consistent with
pneumopericardium, question traumatic source, but etiology
unclear. Recommend close follow-up clinically and imaging to
resolution.
2. Massive cardiomegaly worsened as compared to [**2126**], but stable
since
[**2128-11-18**]. Unchanged moderate-to-large simple
pericardial effusion.
3. No intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hematoma.
4. Left renal cyst.
5. Anasarca.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
1. Trace air tracking through the anterior chest wall into
retrosternal space without sternal fracture extending into
apparently the anterior pericardium consistent with
pneumopericardium, question traumatic source, but etiology
unclear. Recommend close follow-up
