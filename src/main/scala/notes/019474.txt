BRIEF HISTORY:   This 37 year old man with hypertension,
hyperlipidemia
and strong family history of CAD presents to the lab with
cresendo chest
pain / NSTEMI and ETT at OSH revealing for inferior ST
depressions.
  INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:  NSTEMI.
  PROCEDURE:
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French angled pigtail catheter,
advanced
to the left ventricle through a 5 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation: was initiated with an
introducer
sheath using a Cardiac Assist 9 French 30cc wire guided
catheter,
inserted via the right femoral artery.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominanat system

revealed severe three vessel coronary disease. The LMCA was free
of
angiographically apparent disease. The mid LAD had a 90%
stenosis and
a high diagonal, a 80% stenosis in its lower pole. A large OM
was
sutoally occluded. The RCA had a proximal total occlusion with
left to
right collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial blood
pressure. There was elevated left sided filling pressures with
LVEDP of
25 mmHg.
3. There was no evidence of aortic stenosis upon pullback from
LV to
ascending aorta.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
