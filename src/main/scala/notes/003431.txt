Studies:
---------
EKG-  Aflutter 3:1. no acute ST changes

Abd CT [**2111-11-22**]- CT ABDOMEN: There is trace pericardial effusion
and small right pleural effusion. Variable attenuation of the
lung bases suggest underlying air trapping. Bibasilar
atelectasis is also noted.  Within the limitation of this non-
contrast study, the spleen, liver, right adrenal gland and right
kidney are unremarkable.  A 1.5-cm hypodensity is seen in the
lower pole of the left kidney which likely represents a cyst,
unchanged.  There is left adrenal gland thickening, unchanged.
The pancreas is unremarkable.  Loops of small bowel are
collapsed. There is minimal calcification of the descending
aorta.

CT OF THE PELVIS:  Multiple soft-tissue attenuation masses are
seen in the pelvis which appear to be contiguous with the uterus
on this limited non-contrast study and likely represent
fibroids.  The rectum, sigmoid colon, and appendix are
unremarkable.  The bladder is unremarkable.  There is no free
fluid or free air.

BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious sclerotic or lytic
lesions identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intra-abdominal pathology identified.
2. Trace right pleural effusion and pericardial effusion.
3. Left kidney cyst and left adrenal gland thickening,
unchanged.

Pelvic ultrasound [**2111-11-22**]-
FINDINGS:  Transabdominal and transvaginal examinations were
performed, the latter for better evaluation of the uterus and
adnexa.  The uterus is anteverted measuring 7.4 x 4.9 x 7.2 cm.
Multiple fibroids are noted, the largest one in the right
lateral fundus measuring approximately 4.3 cm.  Left-sided
exophytic fibroid is noted measuring approximately 3.2 cm.  The
right ovary measures 2.7 x 1.2 x 2.1 cm.  The left ovary
measures 3.7 x 1.8 x 2.0 cm.  Free fluid is noted within the
pelvis.  Adjacent to the left ovary, there appear to be
septations in one of the images that are not reproducible in
real time.  Doppler evaluation of the ovaries demonstrates no
evidence of color flow or Doppler waveforms, which is thought to
be artifactual given the normal appearance of the ovaries.  The
endometrial stripe is distorted by the presence of fibroids and
cannot be accurately evaluated.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Fibroid uterus.
2.  Bilateral normal ovarian size and echotexture.  Doppler
interrogation of the ovaries demonstrates no evidence of color
flow or Doppler waveforms. Although the ovaries are normal in
size and echotexture, cannot completely rule out torsion.  Given
the difficulty in the evaluation for blood flow, pelvic MRI
could be obtained if clinically indicated.

[**2111-11-22**] AP CHEST:  The mediastinal silhouette is unchanged with
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette again noted.  The
pulmonary vascularity is unremarkable. The lungs are clear
without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

<b>Other Studies:</b>
ECG ([**1-8**]):
Regular tachycardia is probably atrial fibrillation. Left axis
deviation.
Probable anterior myocardial infarction, age undetermined. Low
QRS voltage. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to tracing
of [**2112-1-3**] the rhythm is now regular. There is loss of the
anterior R wave and there is decreased QRS voltage.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2112-1-7**] 12:48 PM
FINDINGS: Two views of the chest were obtained. There is mild
fluid overload with vascular engorgement, slightly worse than
the prior examination dated [**2112-1-4**]. The cardiac silhouette
remains enlarged. The bony thorax is grossly intact.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2112-1-4**] 6:03 AM

AP UPRIGHT CHEST: There is marked improvement of the bilateral
pulmonary edema, now mild. No effusion is seen. The cardiac
silhouette remains enlarged.

IMPRESSION: Marked improvement of the bilateral pulmonary edema,
now mild.
