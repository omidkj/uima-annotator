Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope, ICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
epicardial and endocardial ablation x 2
cardiac catheterization
arterial line placement
central line and swan ganz catheter placement (right IJ)

History of Present Illness:
66F admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-18**] with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
(EF 20%), chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin, s/p ICD [**7-24**]
for secondary prevention, with episode of syncope last night
while sitting in a chair. Reports feeling "haziness" just
before, then husband reports patient slumped over in chair and
"jumped" x 2, appearing like previous ICD firings. Pt
subsequently awoke, fully oriented, asymptomatic, brought to the
ED. Pt reports similar episode on Monday [**11-12**]. Prior to that,
last ICD firing was on Halloween. She has recently had increased
fatigability. She reports she went to see her outpatient
cardiologist last Monday, who told her to re-load with
amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **] x 7 days (today is day 7). She was then
instructed to take 200mg daily starting tomorrow, an increase
from her prior dose of 100mg daily. She reports good compliance
with her medications. Pt denies preceding or recent chest pain,
shortness of breath, increase in LE swelling, PND, orthopnea, or
palpitations. She reports occasional sensation of ICD getting
hot without firing. ROS positive for 1 day of loose stools on
Monday, no associated abd pain/F/C/melena/BRBPR, self-resolved.
She has had normal po intake, urine output, and BMs since.

Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation 70bpm, normal axis, QRS
136, <1mm ST depression V5-6/I/aVL (seen on prior [**10-30**]), QRS
slightly longer vs [**10-30**] study.

TELEMETRY: AF 60s, occ PVCs

CXR: Left-sided ventricular pacer -fibrillator is seen with lead
in unchanged position. Marked cardiomegaly is stable. There is
no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. There is mild blunting
of the right costophrenic angle likely representing a small
pleural effusion. The osseous structures are unremarkable.

ECHO [**11-19**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = XX %). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

ECHO [**11-29**]: There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 10-15%). There is a small echodense pericardial
effusion, limited to the posterolateral aspect of the
pericardium, adjacent to the left ventricle and abutting the AV
groove. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood,
inflammation or other cellular elements. There is no apparent
free-flowing fluid in the pericardial space, and no effusion
anterior to ehe right ventricle. No right atrial or right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.

IMPRESSION: Small, loculated echodense pericardial effusion.
Severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

ECHO [**11-30**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = [**10-6**] %). There is
moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion mostly
adjacent to the LA and inferolateral/posterolateral LV measuring
1.3 cm in the largest dimension (taken in the subcostal view).
Upon 45 degrees sitting position, the effusion remains in the
same location with no significant component near the apical
region and only a small 0.4 cm component anterior to the RV.
There is mild variation of MV inflow with respiration but
overall no major convincing echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic
collapse is seen.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-11-29**],
the effusion is in the same position but appears to be smaller,
otherwise no changes.

ECHO [**11-30**]: There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2159-11-30**], the findings are similar. Left ventricular
contractile function remains profoundly reduced.

ECHO [**12-6**]: The left atrium is elongated. The left ventricular
cavity is dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 10-15%). Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. No right atrial or right ventricular
diastolic collapse is seen.

IMPRESSION: Small pericardial effusion. Severe left ventricular
systolic dysfunction.

CARDIAC CATH [**12-5**]:  Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system reveals no angiographically apparent
coronary artery disease.  The LMCA, LAD, LCx, RCA and their
branchs are without angiographically significant coronary artery
disease.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
