Chief Complaint:
code stroke


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Extraventricular drain


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76yo man with ESRD, DM, neuropathy who is
brought to the ED for R-sided weakness.

The patient went to bed at 10pm. At that time he was fine
according to his wife. [**Name (NI) **] around 1.15am, he went up to rinse
his mouth, as it is often very dry. At that point he told his
wife that he felt "off". He then went back to bed. About 10
minutes later, he turned on the TV, which he normally never
does. His speech was fine at that time, as was his walking. He
said however "that he could not find the time". He new his name,
but mumbled some: he wanted to say he was restless, but said he
was "restitution" according to his wife.

He then fell and was unable to get up. His wife gave him [**Location (un) 2452**]
juice, cereal/sugars, coke, and he became somewhat better. His
wife and his son were unable to get him up though, and EMS was
called.  EMS put him in a chair, and he apparently slumped over
to the R. His R side was weak, but he was able to move his arm
agains gravity. He was still talking at that time. He was
brought over and on the way he had projectile vomiting.

Code stroke was called at 3.45am. At bedside at 3.48am.
Attempted to do the NIHSS exam, while staff was putting in
central line, drawing blood. Pt was then intubated for airway
protection (which was difficult). The exam was therefore
somewhat limited.

CXR: R-LL consolidation?

CT head: L-basal ganglia bleed with hemorrhage breaking into the
L-lateral ventricle and inot the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the R-lateral
ventricle; third and fourth ventricle also filled. Some
effacement of the sulci of the L-frontal lobe

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 76yo man with ESRD, DM, neuropathy who is
brought to the ED for R-sided weakness. Code stroke was called
and NIHSS was 10. Pt was intubated prior to CT scan. CT revealed
a L-basal ganglia hemorrhage with breakthrough of hemorrhage
into
the ventricular system. Coags were fine; bloodpressure ranged
form the 160's to 230's. He is febrile (100.8). CXR showed a
possible RLL PNA. The etiology of the hemorrhage is likely
hypertensive given the location. In addition, the pt may be
prone
to hemorrhage given decreased PLT function in the setting of
ESRD. The patient was out of the time window for factor VII
trial.

[**8-29**]:
Neuro: Nsurg consented with pt's family and R EVD placed.
Opening ICP 15. Repeated head CT slightly more blood in
ventricles and drain deep into 3rd ventricle->drain pulled back
by nsurg. Rec'ing TPA interventricularly.
CV: Placed on nipride then nicardipine gtt for HTN (SBPs in
190-200s) with goal SBP 120-140, ICP<20, DBP <90.
Renal: dialysis team defer HD til tomorrow no urgent indication
today.
Resp: CXR loculated R effusion?->chest CT when stabilized
ID: afeb, no WBC->dc'd abx for now. CIS.

[**9-2**]:
GNRs in sputum from [**8-31**] awaiting S&S. Chest CT suspicious for
superinfection with TB in R loculated effusion. ID consulted
recommended vanc/ceftaz/flagyl and r/o TB with 3 induced
sputums. Renal recs for renal dosing in chart. Interventional
pulm consulted and will hold off on tap until sputum returns but
awaiting final recs.

[**9-3**]:
Spoke with family re:possible need for trach and peg. ID recs
agree with vanc/ceftaz/flagyl. Renal recs approp dosing b4 or
after HD. Per ID, fibrothorax is old and was seen in hospital.
?High risk thoracentesis per IP also likely chronic.

[**9-8**]:
The family decided to make the patient CMO, since they had long
spoken about his wishes never to be on life support. He was
therefore extubated, after the family confirmed their wishes
with palliative care, and comfort measures were undertaken. The
patient passed away after extubation.
