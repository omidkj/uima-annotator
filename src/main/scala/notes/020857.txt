AP CXR: Body habitus limits evaluation. No focal consolidation
or superimposed edema is appreciated. There is minimal
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. The cardiac silhouette is
stable in size likely top normal accounting for patient and
technical factors. No definite effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
There are prominent pulmonary arteries likely due to underlying
pulmonary arterial hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Limited examination. No focal consolidation or other
pulmonary abnormality noted.
.
CT abd/pelvis w/wo contrast [**8-27**]: 1. Hyperdense cystic lesion
along the medial left kidney as seen on ultrasound, which likely
represents a proteinaceous cyst; however, superinfection cannot
be excluded, and continued clinical evaluation is advised. No
evidence for delayed excretion of contrast to suggest
pyelonephritis.
2. No acute inflammatory process within the abdomen or pelvis.
3. Small right pleural effusion
.
Renal US 8/6:1. Bilateral renal cysts. The cyst on the right
kidney is simple whereas the cyst on the left kidney is
septated. This septated cyst cannot be further evaluated on
ultrasound.
2. Solitary gallstone.
