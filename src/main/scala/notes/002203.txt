Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute on chronic renal failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, Extubation
Placement of nephrostomy tube on left and a stent of right
ureter
Irrigation and debridement of right wrist

History of Present Illness:
79yoM with h/o OSA, CAD s/p MI and CVA, diastolic CHF admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 12728**] with sepsis secondary to Klebsiella
bacteremia, admitted again on [**6-11**] to Urology service from rehab
with acute renal failure, transferred to MICU [**6-12**] with MRSA
bacteremia, ARF, and respiratory failure.
.
Patient was admitted [**Date range (1) 12728**] with sepsis due to Klebsiella
bacteremia.  Source of Klebsiella infection was not known, but
was thought to be from pneumonia seen as retrocardiac opacity on
CXR.  Urinalysis was negative at that time.  He was intubated
during that admission for airway protection and hypercarbic
respiratory failure.  Although he has OSA, he is not a CO2
retainer.  He was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] to complete at
14day course of levofloxacin, to which the Klebsiella (from
culture at [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital) was sensitive.  During his initial
presentation he did develop ARF with creatinine up to 2.8 from
baseline of 1.7-1.9.  Creat returned to baseline during the
hospitalization.  It rose to 2.0 prior to discharge after ACE-I
was restarted.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED [**2123-6-11**] after two days of
intermittent right sided abdominal pain, decreased urine output,
anorexia, and temp spike to 101.  According to the patient's
wife, he did not feel himself soon after admission to rehab,
refusing to eat, being lethargic and unwilling to participate in
rehab activity.  In the ED patient found to have ARF with creat
7.3, [K+] 5.1.  CT showed right UVJ stone, right perinephric
stranding, left ureteral stone, and hydronephrosis.  He was
admitted to Urology service and underwent left percutaneous
nephrostomy tube placement.  He was also found to have UTI and
was started empirically on Vanc/Levo/Ceftriaxone.  Urine culture
and blood cultures (4/4 [**6-11**]) grew MRSA, and CTX/Levo were
discontinued [**2123-6-13**].  Despite nephrostomy tube placement,
patient continued to have ongoing oliguric renal failure, which
renal felt was due to persistant obstruction vs ATN.  He was not
hemodialyzed.
.
On [**2123-6-14**] he underwent right ureteral stent placement,
retrograde pyelography, and removal of stones.  He remained
intubated post-operatively.

On [**2123-6-17**]- Pt also complained of right wrist pain/swelling and
subsequently was found to have septic wrist. This was irrigated
and debrided on [**6-17**]. Cultures positive for MRSA.

On [**2123-6-19**], pt was extubated.

On [**2123-6-20**], pt transferred to CC-7A. Reported feeling weak.
Denied HA, dizziness, chest pain,palpatations, SOB, cough,
abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, edema.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:

[**2123-6-19**] post-extub CXR: Endotracheal tube has been removed.
Feeding tube and left PICC line remain in place. Cardiac and
mediastinal contours are stable. Left lower lobe atelectasis is
slightly improved. Moderate left effusion is unchanged

[**2123-6-16**] echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricle may be mildly dilated. Right
ventricular
systolic function is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.


[**2123-6-13**] CT Abd/pelvis
1. Status post left nephrostomy. New 1.2-cm oval-shaped focal
density, which may be related to recent nephrostomy. Persistent
left ureteral stone and right obstructing UVJ stone, measuring 3
mm with hydronephrosis and hydroureter. No obstructing right
renal stones.
2. Heterogeneous density of the kidneys, especially on the
right, with 2.6 cm high-dense focal lesion. As suggested on the
prior study, these lesions can be further evaluated by
ultrasound.
3. Persistent fat stranding along the ascending colon, unchanged
compared to the prior study.
4. Limited study without intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**]. Ectatic
appearance of iliac bifurcation.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:
Pt was admitted to the MICU after he underwent R ureteral stent
placement, but became difficult to wean from the vent
post-operatively, and also was found to have MRSA bacteremia.
He also grew out MRSA from his urine as well, and also from his
R wrist.  He was treated with vancomycin, dosed for level<15.
Plastic surgery was consulted for his R septic wrist, and he
went to the OR for washout of this joint.  He had a TTE, which
was negative for vegetation.  Surveillance cultures were
negative x 3 days.  Pt continued to be in ARF, despite R
ureteral stent placement and L percutaneous nephrostomy.  Renal
service was consulted, and pt was believed to have ARF secondary
to both recent obstructions as well as ATN.  His diuretics were
held, and his Cr began to improve.  He then progressed into the
post-obstructive diuresis phase, and renal service signed off.
His meds were renally dosed during this time. Pt was extubated
on [**2123-6-19**], and tolerated extubation well.  Pt was restarted on
metoprolol and norvasc, but his ACEI and Lasix continued to be
held.  He was continued on ASA and Plavix during his MICU stay.
He became hypertensive to 150's-160's during the end of his MICU
course, and his metoprolol was
