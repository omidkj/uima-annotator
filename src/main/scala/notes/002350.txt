History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old woman with h/o restrictive lung
disease (bleomycin toxicity), sarcoidosis, systolic CHF (EF 10%,
adriamycin toxicity), Factor V Leiden, s/p trach and PEG
placement, here with recurrent fevers. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
last year for respiratory distress was intubated and unable to
wean off the [**Last Name (un) **]. She then got a trach and PEG tube. Her
hospitalization was complicated by pna, recurrent fevers, and
C.diff. She was then discharge to  [**Hospital 100**] rehab. In [**Month (only) **] she was
transferred to [**Hospital3 105**] for continued [**Hospital3 **] weaning. She
has had a complicated course since then w/ pneumomediastinum, R
pneumothorax with CT placement in [**Month (only) **], worsening CHF with EF
decreased from 30% to 10%, [**Last Name (un) **] requiring temporary HD, anemia of
chronic disease requiring blood transfusions (last on [**1-31**] for
Hct of 25). Recurrent C-diff with extended course of flagyl and
vanco and resistant pseudomonas pna most recently + sputum cult
on [**1-30**] for which pt was being treated with colistimethate and
aztreonam.
.
Pt was being weaned off the [**Month/Year (2) **] with 20hours off the [**Month/Year (2) **] on
trach mask and only requiring 4 hours of [**Month/Year (2) **] support. However,
in the last 2 days, she was only able to tolerate respiratory
trial off the [**Month/Year (2) **] for most of 1.5 hours. She had increased
sputum and became febrile to 102. She also c/o increase L ear
pain and decrease hearing. She had a CT scan of maxillofacial
sinuses from [**1-30**] that showed mastoiditis and otitis media. As
per note, there was concern for cholesteatoma and she was
transfer here for ENT eval.
.
On arrival to the ED, her initial vitals were Temp of 97.6, 115,
99/75, 30, 100% on trach on [**Month/Year (2) **]. Patient was given vanc and
cefepime and receiced 2L of NS. Her BP responded by increasing
to 110s/60s. She has reamined sinus tachy in 110s. She had a
femoral line placed which the patient was pulled as per nursing
report. She had some of of the fluid and vanco infiltrated into
her tight. Her CT of her maxillofacial sinuses in OHS was
evaluated by our radiologist and the prelim reports that there
is no new findings when compared to prior CT done in [**Month (only) **].
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt is on [**Month (only) **] via trach with pressure
control Fio2 35%, PEEP 5, PIP 35, rate of 14 sating 100%. Pt is
overall comfortable. She is sleepy, but responsive. Answering
appropriately to questions. She had just received some ativan
prior to my evaluation.
.
Review of systems:  Unable to fully assess ROM given that she is
non-verbal due to trach and sleepy on arrival.
(+) Per HPI. She c/o increase L side ear pain and decrease
hearing on L side, mild L facial edema as per OHS note. Occ
diarrhea

Family History:
- Maternal: clots, PE, TIA, Factor V Leiden, dementia at 92
- Paternal: CAD, pancreatic CA
- Siblings: sister died [**2162-12-24**] from complications of DM,
another sister with thyroid problems and high cholesterol
- Children: one healthy daughter without [**Name2 (NI) **] V Leiden
- Uncle: colon cancer

Physical Exam:
Vitals: 115, 129/77, RR 26, 100% on [**Name2 (NI) **]
General: sleepy but responsive to verbal stimuli. Non-verbal due
to trach, but answering appropriately to questions. No acute
distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, Mild left facial edema and non tender L ear or
mastoid process. L tympanic membrane with yellowish opacity,
bulging. R with pearl white membrane.
Lungs: rhochorus through out, no increase in WOB
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, mildly distended, bowel sounds
present (hyperactive), no rebound tenderness or guarding, no
organomegaly
GU: no foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses on bil LE, no clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.

Pertinent Results:
Head CT [**2-2**]: FINDINGS: There is complete opacification of the
left mastoid air cells and the left middle ear. This is similar
in appearance to the [**2163-9-16**] study. There is no
underlying bony destruction. Opacification of the left mastoid
air cells are seen as far back as [**2162-11-21**]. Remaining
visualized paranasal sinuses and right mastoid air cells are
clear.
.
IMPRESSION: Chronic opacification of the left mastoid air cells
and left
middle ear with no evidence of underlying bony destruction.
.
Chest X-Ray [**2-2**]: IMPRESSION: Overall, there is slight increased
opacity of the interstitial markings and ultimately it is
difficult to determine whether there is a superimposed process
on the extensive background of abnormal lungs. Consider, if
clinically feasible, a trial of diuresis with repeat radiography
to discern whether there is an element of superimposed pulmonary
edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old woman with h/o restrictive lung
disease (bleomycin toxicity), sarcoidosis, systolic CHF (EF 10%,
adriamycin toxicity), Factor V Leiden, s/p trach and PEG
placement who was sent from [**Hospital3 **] due to concern for
mastoiditis. Also noted to have fevers and being treated for
pseudomonal pneumonia.
.
# ? Mastoiditis: The OSH was concerned for possible infection
and sent her to [**Hospital1 18**] for ENT evaluation. After review by our
radiologist, there was no significant change in the CT scan when
compared to in [**Month (only) 359**]. Seen by ENT- felt no clinical or
radiological evidence of acute mastoiditis, and fluid likely
chronic. No clear evidence of cholesteotoma on CT scans. They
recommend outpatient follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3878**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2349**].
She was briefly started on IV vancomycin which was discontinued
prior to discharge.
.
#. Fevers: On her last [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] in [**Month (only) 359**] she presented with
fevers which were not thought to be due to infection. She was
started on Vanc and meropenam however they
