Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 101385**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] under the care of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
She had MRI imaging and then was taken to the OR. She underwent
a craniotomy for mass resection. The procedure went well without
complications. She went to the ICU for Q1 hour neuro checks. Her
post-op head CT showed some pneumocephalus but no hemorrhage.
She was transferred to the neurosurgical floor on [**4-30**]. The
patient was stable and a steroid taper was begun.

Post-operatively the patient developed expressive aphasia that
improved on subsqeuent days. As work up, the patient underwent a
head CT in the morning of [**5-1**] The scan showed no hemorrhage or
CVA.  Post-operative MRI was equally reassuring.

Physical therapy evaluated the patient, and they determined that
she could go home with PT services. The patient was dicharged
home thereafter.
