History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14963**] is an 80 year old male with known aortic stenosis.
He presented with worsening shortness of breath for the past
several months along with exertional chest discomfort. He denied
symptoms at rest. Cardiac catheterization showed a patent
circumflex stent with disease in the distal LAD and obtuse
marginal branch. Given his worsening congestive heart failure,
he was referred for cardiac surgical intervention.

Family History:
Two brothers underwent CABGs in their 70's - 80's.

Physical Exam:
Discharge Vitals:
General: Elderly male in NAD
HEENT: Oropharynx benign, EOMI
Neck: Supple, no JVD
Lungs: CTA bilaterally
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm
Abdomen: Soft, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds
Ext: Warm, no edema
Pulses: 2+ distally
Neuro: Alert and oriented, CN 2- 12 grossly intact, no focal
deficits noted

Pertinent Results:
[**2108-8-14**] Head CT Scan: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema,
mass, mass effect, or acute vascular territorial infarction.
There is mild ventricular and sulcal prominence, most consistent
with age-appropriate involutional change. There is no fracture.
There are air-fluid levels within the bilateral frontal sinuses,
sphenoid air cells, ethmoid air cells, and maxillary sinuses.
Most likely, this is related to the patient's intubated status.
[**2108-8-20**] Upper Extremity Ultrasound: Partially occlusive distal
left basilic vein thrombus with lack of compressibility. Patent
proximal left basilic vein.
[**2108-8-25**] Head CT Scan: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema,
mass effect, or infarction. Mild ventricular and sulcal
prominence remains present. There is no fracture.
Previously-described air-fluid levels within the bilateral
frontal, sphenoid, ethmoid and maxillary sinuses are no longer
present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14963**] was admitted and underwent an aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Please see seperate dictated operative note for surgical
details. Following the operation, he was brought to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring. He initially required ventricular pacing
for complete heart block. On postoperative day one, he was noted
to have gaze deviation associated with deficits in communication
and stereotyped purposeless movement of his left hand. Neurology
was consulted and head CT scan was obtained which showed no
evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or acute
vascular territorial infarction. Over the next several days, his
neurologic status improved. He became more alert with more
purposeful movements. He was eventually extubated on
postoperative day three without incident. His complete heart
block gradually resolved with developement of acclerated
junctional rhythm. He was transferred to the floor. He went on
to experience sustained ventricular tachycardia on postoperative
day four. He converted back to a sinus rhythm after intravenous
Amiodarone and Lidocaine were administered, and he was
transferred back to the CSRU. Ep was consulted and placed a
temporary wire and planned for PPM/ICD placement. It was delayed
secondary to phlebitis which was treated with vancomycin and
then keflex. A [**Company **] dual chamber ICD was placed on
[**2108-8-24**]. He was transferred back to the floor. He was seen by
psychiatry after a code purple.he received haldol and a 1:1
sitter. He was seen by speech and swallow who recommended pureed
diet and thin liquids. His confusion resolved. Video swallow
showed mild to moderate dysphagia and a soft diet was
recommended. He slowly improved and was ready for discharge to
rehab on [**2108-8-29**].
