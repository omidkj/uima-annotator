Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Clindamycin / Celery / apple / bees

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Malaise, shortness of breath, lower extremity pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none.

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old female with morbid obesity,
obesity-hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea
complicated by pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale who is
presenting with worsening volume overload in the past two weeks.
She also has a history of polyarticular gout, recently on
prednisone taper, and chronic renal insufficiency.
Ms [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 60251**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2126-11-28**] for
hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation and
tracheostomy. She was discharged to [**Hospital1 700**]
and she was successfully weaned off the ventilator; currently
she has been managed at rehab with red capping during the day
and Passy-Muir valve at night with humidified air that she uses
inconsistently.
Her current admission was prompted after a routine visit to her
PCP; she was sent to the ED for worsening volume overload. In
the ED, she had transient and questionable hypotension to 80s
systolic with immediate improvement without intervention. She
was triaged to MICU for diuresis in the presence of this
transient episode of hypotension.
Her pulmonary hypertension is multifactorial - she has a history
of Fen-Phen use in the past; she also has obstructive sleep
apnea which was previously managed by CPAP. She is currently
oxygen dependent on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Recently, she was diagnosed with a DVT in her right upper
extremity; she has been on coumadin and lovenox bridge - however
it seems according to the last pulmonary note coumadin is being
held until tracheostomy tube is changed in early [**Month (only) 116**].
She is also complaining of joint pain in her left ankle
especially; she has a history of polyarticular gout affecting
sacroiliac joints, PIPs, ankles on recent prednisone taper.
Her lasix dose at home is 20 mg daily; she reports being
compliant with a gradual increase in lower extremity swelling
and pain over the past couple months. During this time, her
prednisone was also being tapered.
She is coughing up clearish sputum, but denies feeling much more
short of breath than normal; denies orthopnea, chest pain, chest
pressure, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Not ambulating at rehab
given pain in her ankles.


Past Medical History:
1. Morbid obesity (s/p gastric bypass [**2113**])
2. Obstructive sleep apnea (noctural BiPAP 18/15, home O2 3-4L
via nasal cannula)
3. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
4. Severe pulmonary artery hypertension (attributed to OSA)
5. Cor pulmonale attributed to severe pulmonary hypertension
6. Asthma
7. Osteoarthritis (bilateral knees)
8. Diastolic heart failure (2D-Echo [**1-/2124**] showing LVEF 70-80%,
PAP 64 mmHg)
9. Chronic kidney disease (stage III-IV, baseline creatinine
1.8-2.2)
10. Rosacea
11. Hypertension
12. Iron deficiency anemia
11. s/p ventral hernia repair with mesh and component separation
([**5-/2119**])
12. s/p debridement of anterior abdominal wall and complex
repair ([**6-/2119**])

Social History:
She has 2 adult children and adopted 3 so total of 5 children.
She notes no tobacco use, rare alcohol use currently but notes a
former heavy alcohol history in the distant past. She denies
recreational substance use.

hypertension in siblings, mother and throughout the maternal
family as well as kidney disease.

Upper back u/s:
FINDINGS: A hypoechoic tubular fluid collection is noted in the
region
marked, 11 mm below skin surface, measuring 1.1 x 0.6 x 2.9 cm.

ECHO:
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity
dilation with free wall hypokinesis. Pulmonary artery
hypertension. Normal left ventricular cavity size and global
systolic function. No intracardiac shunt suggested at rest.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-12-3**],
the estimated PA systolic pressure is now lower (may not reflect
a true change due to suboptimal technical quality of the current
study acquired with the patient sitting up in a chair).

CT abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic process.
2. Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
3. Post-gastric bypass. No bowel obstruction.



Brief Hospital Course:
This 61 year old female with a history of pulmonary hypertension
and cor pulmonale secondary to obesity-hypoventilation syndrome
and obstructive sleep apnea presents with worsening volume
overload.

# hypoxia [**1-30**] OSA, pulmonary HTN, and obesity hypoventilation:
Initially the patient was admitted to the MICU.  She was seen by
both sleep medicine and IP.  As per IP, it was recommended that
the patient con't to uncap the trachestomy tube at night and
place a trach mask with humidifier around that. The patient was
doing well on this regimen while in the unit and was called out
to the floor.

The patient was initially doing well while on the floor, but she
then triggered for hypoxia on the floor and returned to MICU on
[**2127-4-25**].
