slurred speech, HA and Afib with RVR. On exam, she has Afib with
RVR, her language is fluent and she is able to follow commands,
but she has mild dysarthria. There are no asymmetries on motor
or sensory exam and coordination seems fine.
.
NEURO:  Repeat NCHCT performed without signs of acute infarct.
She was started on Aspirin.  Her A1C was 5.6 and fasting lipid
panel was total cholesterol 212, trig 98, HDL 57, LDL 135.  She
was started on Lipitor.  MRI brain was deferred since it would
not change patient's management.

CV:  Continued telemetry and cycled cardiac enzymes which were
negative x3.  [**Known firstname **] had atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response which was initially controlled with a
diltiazem gtt.  Patient was not on coumadin due to fall risk and
prior subarachnoid hemorrhage.  [**Known firstname **] was switched over to oral
Lopressor with good effect.  Chest x-ray was negative for fluid
overload.  ECHO was deferred.
