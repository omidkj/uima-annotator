Date of Birth:   [**2085-1-18**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiac Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chief complaint was substernal chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57-year-old
male who was referred to the Cardiac Surgery team following
catheterization due to a recent abnormal exercise tolerance
test and echocardiogram.

He reports the new onset of left-sided blurry vision while in
[**State 108**] this past [**Month (only) 958**].  He had an eye examination and it
sounds like he was told that he had an embolus that
obstructed one of his retinal arteries.  Further workup
included a carotid ultrasound which was reportedly negative
and a cardiac echocardiogram which revealed cardiomyopathy.
When he went to go see his cardiologist here in
[**State 350**], he was found to have an ejection fraction of
40% with 1+ mitral regurgitation.

On his stress echocardiogram, he exercised for four minutes
and had minimal electrocardiogram changes, but he did have
global hypokinesis and inferior akinesis at rest.  Following
exercise, he had left ventricular systolic dysfunction that
failed to improve, and his anteroseptal wall became akinetic.

In terms of symptoms, he reports only that he has had a mild
decrease in his energy level.  He denies any history of chest
pain or significant shortness of breath.  He notices only
mild dyspnea after climbing several flights of stairs.
Recently, he has been started on Toprol-XL and Zaroxolyn.  He
denies any claudication, orthopnea, edema, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, or lightheadedness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history was notable for
the following)
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
3.  High cholesterol.
4.  Status post left retinal artery blockage.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post tonsillectomy.
2.  Status post removal of pilonidal cyst.

ALLERGIES:  He is not allergic to any drugs.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Glucophage-XR 1000 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Glucotrol-XL 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Avandia 8 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. q.d.
6.  Zaroxolyn 5 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o. q.d.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory
studies on admission revealed his white blood cell count
was 4.2, hematocrit was 39.4.  Blood urea nitrogen was 35 and
creatinine was 1.5.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination he was an older white male who appeared slightly
anxious but was otherwise in no acute distress.  His blood
pressure was 170/109, heart rate was 95, oxygen saturation
was 96% on room air.  His neck was without bruits.  His lungs
were clear.  His heart had a first heart sound and second
heart sound that was tachycardic and occasionally regular
without murmur.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  His pulse examination revealed his femorals
were 2+ bilaterally.  Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis
were also 2+ bilaterally.  There was no lower extremity
edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service for a cardiac catheterization.  This demonstrated an
80% left anterior descending artery lesion, a 60% left
circumflex lesion before the first obtuse marginal, and a 90%
lesion after first obtuse marginal, and a totally occluded
right coronary artery with extensive left-to-right
collaterals to the posterior descending artery.

On [**2142-5-8**], the patient was taken to the operating room
where he had a coronary artery bypass graft times four with
left radial artery harvest.  His grafts were left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, left
radial to obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to diagonal,
and saphenous vein graft to right posterior descending
artery.

His procedure itself was unremarkable.  Postoperatively, he
was taken intubated to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care
Unit on Levophed, Milrinone, nitroglycerin, and propofol
drips.  He remained intubated overnight and took well into
the first postoperative day until he could be extubated.  He
did maintain a pressor requirement, and by the second
postoperative day was able to be weaned down to only
Neo-Synephrine.

During this time, his platelets started to drop, and his
hematocrit also trended as low as 19.  He required a
transfusion with 4 units of packed red blood cells and 1 six
pack of platelets.  We felt that perhaps his thrombocytopenia
was due to his Zantac which was subsequently switched to
Protonix.  In addition, while in the Intensive Care Unit he
had a bump in his creatinine which peaked at
approximately 2.4.  By the third postoperative day, the
patient was stable enough to be transferred to the floor.
His platelets bottomed out at approximately 31 and then
subsequently rebounded, and by the time of his discharge
were 137.

The patient's hospitalization on the floor was unremarkable
with the exception of difficulty diuresing him further.  His
preoperative weight was 113 kg, and upon arrival to the floor
his weight was approximately 120 kg, and throughout his four
subsequent days on the floor, he lost a minimal amount of
weight despite an increase in his Lasix.  He ultimately
required 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.   It was unclear whether or not he
will need to remain on this as an outpatient.

His chest tubes were discontinued on postoperative day five.
In addition, his pacing wires were removed.  The removal of
both of these was delayed by his thrombocytopenia; however,
once they were removed he had no complications and did not
develop a pleural effusion.

By the seventh postoperative day, [**2142-5-18**], the patient
was eating, ambulating, voiding, and was cleared by Physical
Therapy to be discharged to home.  He was discharged home in
the care of his family in stable condition with instructions
to see his primary care physician in three days to have a
potassium drawn and to have a full follow-up visit within the
next two weeks.  In addition, he was to follow up with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] in approximately six weeks.

The patient had been started on Imdur during this
hospitalization due to his left radial artery bypass graft.
His primary care physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].[**Name (NI) 43096**], and the need
for the patient to stay on Imdur was communicated to him.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
 2.  Avandia 8 mg p.o. q.d.
 3.  Glucotrol-XL 10 mg p.o. q.d.
 4.  Glucophage-XR 1000 mg p.o. q.d.

 6.  Imdur 60 mg p.o. q.d. (times three months).
 7.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
 8.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. (times seven days).
 9.  Potassium chloride 40 mEq p.o. b.i.d. (times seven
days).
10.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. (while taking Percocet).
11.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease and unstable angina; now status
post coronary artery bypass graft times four.
