History of Present Illness:
41 y/o previously healthy female with 2wk history of painful
cervical [**Doctor First Name **]. She was first seen by ENT on [**6-20**], given a
course of Augmentin without improvement. LAD worsened to involve
anterior and posterior chains on both sides of neck. A steroid
taper was initiated and an FNA was then done, and was
??????nondiagnostic??????, but they empirically added valtrex to her
regimen. A mono screen and cat scratch disease screening was
negative. On Weds. night [**6-27**], she developed headache and neck
pain, and was referred to the [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital ER, where she was
admitted. Initial CBC showed WBC of 11.7 with 30% bands, Hct 30,
Plt 97. ALT was 129, AST 77. Cr was normal. CRP elevated to 277.
An LP was performed, which revealed no cells. CT head was neg.

Her hospital course since then is notable for [**Doctor First Name **] that has been
progressive, and continued fevers. ID was consulted, thought a
viral syndrome, sent off multiple seroligies (see labs).
Initially treated with zosyn and azithromycin, and eventually
added vancomycin. She continued to spike was worsen clincially.
On [**6-29**], she became more SOB. CXR performed, had progressed from
clear to bibasilar infiltrates. She had increasing hypoxemia,
with ABG showing 3.39/40/55 on NRB. Antibiotics broadened to
include levofloxacin. She was intubated on [**6-30**] for hypoxemia.
Intesivist added doxy today. Echo showed EF 35-40% and small
pericardial effusion.  Central access was obtained and she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.

Hospital course also significant for development of bilateral
parotiditis. Mumps IgG+, but IgM still pending.

No recent travel. No exposure to pets, animals, farms, no sick
contacts. Review of systems is unable to be obtained [**3-13**] patient
is intubated, sedated.

Past Medical History:
None

Social History:
No smoking, very rare alcohol. She is an avid runner. Married
with 2 children, works as an on-line editor.

Family History:
Breast cancer.

CXR ([**2114-6-30**]) - FINDINGS: There are no old films available for
comparison. The ET tube is 5.5 cm above the carina. The NG tube
is slightly high with the proximal port just above the GE
junction. There are bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and
probable small right effusion. The heart is mildly enlarged.

RUQ U/S ([**2114-7-1**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of CBD dilation or stones.
2. Non-dilated gallbladder, free of stones. Moderate amount of
pericholecystic fluid and mild gallbladder wall edema may be
compatible with diffuse liver process such as hepatitis, even in
the absence of focal
intrahepatic ultrasound abnormalities.
3. Mild splenomegaly

CT NECK W CONTRAST ([**2114-7-1**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, particularly in
the
jugulodigastric and posterior cervical triangles. These findings
may be
reactive.
2. Slightly hyperenhancing and heterogeneous appearance of the
parotid glands bilaterally, may reflect reported history of
parotiditis. No discrete fluid collection or abscess identified.

3. Diffuse infiltration of the subcutaneous [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] reflect
anasarca.
4. Large bilateral pleural effusions, partially imaged, better
assessed on
concurrent chest CT.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ([**2114-7-1**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. ET tube appropriately positioned.
2. Side port of the gastric tube is positioned at the GE
junction.
3. Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with neighboring
compressive
atelectasis. An underlying consolidative process cannot be
excluded.
4. Enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes, with no evidence of
mediastinal
or hilar lymphadenopathy.
5. Small pericardial effusion.

ECHO ([**2114-7-2**]) - The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the basal half of the anterior and
anteroseptal walls. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 40 %). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests
normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good lea
