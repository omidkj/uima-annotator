Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yoF with PMH DM II, HL, CAD s/p LAD STEMI in [**2157**], NSTEMI
[**6-/2167**] with BMS to LAD presents with progressive dyspnea and
orthopnea and is admitted to the CCU for hypoxia.
.
According to the patient's daughter, the patient developed
progressive dyspnea three days ago. The symptoms progressed and
last night she developed orthopena and paroxsymal nocturnal
dyspnea. She was agitated and confused overnight and this
morning felt presyncopal while trying to get out of bed.
.
She presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where initial vitals were  T:97.6
P:90 BP:104/66 RR:14 sats dropped to 85 on NC (flow not
recorded), up to 99% on NRB. She complained of dyspnea, denied
chest pain. Labs were remarkable for WBC: 8.1 Hct:33.6, Cr 1.0,
Trop-T: 0.09 Lactate:2.6 INR: 4.7. CXR showed bilateral
effusions and pulmonary edema. She was given lasix 40mg IV, and
started on BIPAP, complained of nausea and was given zofran. She
became hypotensive to SBP 77 asleep, came to high 80's while
awake, she was started peripheral dopamine and admitted to the
CCU. Vitals on transfer BP:98/67 P:111 RR:26 SaO2 100% on BIPAP
.
On arrival to the CCU, vitals were BP:107/64 P:101 RR: 24 SaO2
95% on 5LNC with shovel mask. She was somnolent and moderately
confused, occasionally pulling at lines. She reported that her
breathing was comfortable, denied neck/back/chest pain, denied
presyncope.

IMAGING/STUDIES
CXR ([**8-18**])
IMPRESSION: Increased bilateral moderate pleural effusions with
compressive lower lobe atelectasis, with probable mild CHF.

CXR ([**8-22**])
n the interim, there has been placement of bibasilar pigtail
catheters with markedly reduction of bilateral pleural
effusions. Small left greater than right pleural effusions
remain. There is persistent left lower lobe
retrocardiac opacity, most likely due to left lower lobe
collapse. There is a discoid atelectasis in the right lower
lobe. There is no evident
pneumothorax.

CXR ([**8-23**])

There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged compared with
[**2167-8-22**]. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular
blurring, consistent with CHF, unchanged allowing for technique.
There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left
lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, probably slightly
improved. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated, with air in the
fundus immediately below it. There is patchy opacity at the
right base, likely reflecting atelectasis. There is minimal
blunting of both costophrenic angles. However, the bilateral
effusions seen on [**2167-8-22**] exam have diminished in size. Bilateral
chest tubes again noted, slightly different in configuration,
particularly on the right. No pneumothorax is detected.

CXR [**2167-8-24**]

No significant change in upper zone pulmonary vascular
redistribution consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion,
cardiomegaly, and small bilateral pleural effusions.
