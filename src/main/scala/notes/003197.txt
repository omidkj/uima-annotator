Micro:
MRSA positive
Sputum cx: no growth
BCx [**2145-7-19**]: NGTD
UCx: no growth
Urine legionella: negative
.
CXr [**2145-7-22**]: Compared to the most recent study from approximately
an hour ago, increased left perihilar opacity likely represents
pulmonary edema or aspiration. Multifocal pneumonia as compared
to yesterday shows decreased consolidation in the right lower
lobe and unchanged consolidation in the left lower lobe.
Biapical opacities are minimally worsened. There is improved but
persistent small bibasal pleural effusions and atelectasis.
Allowing for rotation, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
within normal limits. Extensive mural atherosclerosis of the
aortic arch and descending aorta is unchanged. There is no
pneumothorax.
.
EKG: sinus tachycardia with LVH and ST depressions seen
inferolaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.1 P 140 BP 170/100 R 30 O2 sat
99% on NRB. Pt was intubated for hypoxic respiratory distress
and was given a total of 5L of NS IVF.  CXR revealed right lower
lobe infiltrates and pt was given Levo, Ceftriaxone and Vanc.
BP dropped  to 56/40 after intubation and pt was given narcan
without any improvement.  A right subclavian was placed with CVP
9-12 and levophed was started at 0.04 mcg/kg.  Initial ABG was
7.33/45/136 on AC, FiO2% of 50, TV of 1200 and Lactate of 1.4.
Pt was intubated and sedated on arrival to the ICU.  She was not
following commands, gag response was present and she was still
requiring low dose levophed.
.
# Hypoxic Resp Failure: Pt with fever and shortness of breath
who presented in resp distress and was found to have multifocal
infiltrates on CXR.  Per HCP, pt had recent PNA in 4/[**2144**]. Pt
was started on vanc/zosyn/azithromycin for multifocal HAP (given
nursing home setting) and atypical pneumonia. Sputum cultures
were sent and remained negative for growth.  She likely
sustained an NSTEMI with troponin peak of 0.25 in setting of
hypoxic respiratory distress on admission.  Pt had difficulty
maintaining MAP>65 and required intermittent pressor support.
With no improvement in her condition, antibiotic coverage was
expanded to include meropenem and ciprofloxacin. Pt continued to
have difficulty being weaned from ventilator. Pt self-extubated
twice and required re-intubation with increasing sedation
requirements.  Goals of care were then discussed with the family
given pt's lack of clinical improvement and her distress
associated with intubation. Five days after admission, the
family decided against escalation of care.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was
extubated and placed on comfort measures only. She expired from
cardiopulmonary arrest at 5:47am on [**2145-7-25**].

.
# NSTEMI: Pt had elevated cardiac enzymes with troponin peak to
0.25 before trending downwards. Pt was started on a statin and
EKG changes resolved.
