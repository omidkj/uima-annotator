II. GI Reports
EGD ([**2198-8-14**])
The esophagus appeared normal, no esophageal varices were seen.
The GE junction was regular and located at approximately 40cm
from the incisors. The stomach was entered and closely examined.
Mild portal gastropathy seen throughout the stomach (snake skin
appearance) moderate degree in the fundus with some cherry red
spots. No signs of active bleeding, no ulcers, erosions. The
duodenal bulb was normal. The descending duodenum and duodenal
folds were normal. Retroflexed view in the stomach fundus
revealed small hiatal hernia, no gastric varices. Otherwise
normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: No evidence of active GI bleed to explain
anemia and melena. We will proceed with Colonoscopy. Please keep
patient on clear diet today, start 4L Golytely in PM, drink [**7-13**]
oz every 10-15 min. NPO qith midnight for colonoscopy tomorrow

Colonoscopy ([**2198-8-15**])
Medium grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were noted.
Impression: Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum


Brief Hospital Course:
57M history of hepatocellular carcinoma treated with cyberknife
therapy secondary to HCV and alcoholic cirrhosis, non-oxygen
dependent emphysema admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding from
uncertain source with resolution with normal colonoscopy and EGD
except for hemorrhoids and mild portal gastropathy.

# Gastrointestinal bleeding
Patient presented with hemetemsis, then bright red blood per
rectum, followed by melena per history. EGD on [**2198-8-14**] showed
mild portal gastropathy with no varices. Colonscopy on [**2198-8-15**]
showed internal hemorr
