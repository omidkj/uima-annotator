transferred from OSH after ventricular fibrillation cardiac
arrest

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6450**] is a 56 y/o AA M w/h/o NICMP (EF 30-35%), HTN,
dyslipidemia, old LBBB who was initially admitted to [**Hospital 6451**] hospital [**2200-3-19**] for acute bacterial meningitis.
Blood cultures showed Streptococcus aglacticae, CSF cultures
were negative, though protein and glucose levels were c/w
meningitis. He was initially started ABx w/
vanc/CTX/Amp/Acyclovir was eventually changed to Ampicillin with
a tentative goal of 2 weeks of therapy.
.
He was clinically improving on Rx. However, on [**2200-3-24**] at
about 9:05 am he had a VF arrest for 3-5min (?) while sitting in
bed, for which he was quickly defibrillated back to SR, received
amiodarone 300mg bolus followed by amiodarone drip. A triple
lumen catheter placed in the right femoral artery and he was
transferred to the ICU for further management. His blood
pressure stabilized with IV fluids. He was otherwise awake,
alert with no further symptoms.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for futhter management of his VF
arrest. On arrival to CCU at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was fully awake,
alert and oriented, afebrile w/ stable vital signs. He denies
any complaints and does not recall the event. Pt confirms above
described history. He denies any history of PND, orthopnea,
exertional dyspnea, cough, edema. He has not been symptomatic
with regards to his heart failure.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6450**] is an athletics director. No alcohol, tobacco or

Studies-
-Portable TTE ([**2200-3-25**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with inferior, septal,
anterior and apical hypokinesis. Basal to mid lateral systolic
function appears preserved. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

-Portable TEE ([**2200-3-27**])
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypo to akinesis of the anterior, septal, and inferior walls.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 35 cm
from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is a thin, mobile echodensity within the
right ventricle which may represent a torn tricuspid chord and
is much less concerning for a vegetation [clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]]. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No pathologic valvular regurgitation or vegetations.
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction as described
above.

-MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] W & W/O CONTRAST ([**2200-3-26**])
1. Subtle signal changes at the endplate of L4-5 and enhancement
along the posterior margin of L4-5 disc as well as in the
paraspinal region are suspicious for early changes of discitis.
There is no epidural abscess seen.  Small protrusion in the left
neural foramen at L4-5 is identified, which could be also
secondary to inflammatory changes. This area demonstrates
enhancement.
2. Heterogeneous bone marrow could be related to marrow
hyperplasia from anemia, but clinical correlation is also
recommended to exclude marrow infiltrative process.

-Cardiac MR ([**2200-3-31**]):  1. Severely increased left ventricular
cavity size with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the left
ventricular walls except for the lateral wall. The LVEF was
mildly decreased at 40%. No CMR evidence of prior myocardial
scarring/infarction.
2. Normal right ventricul
