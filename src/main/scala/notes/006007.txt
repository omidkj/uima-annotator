History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 86M with a history of A.fib on coumadin,
systolic CHF with an EF of 35%, AS with an AV area of 1.2-1.9,
s/p pacemaker who presented initially to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**10-27**]
with BRBPR in the setting of an elevated INR of 4. Upon
presentation to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**], he reported BRBPR and large clots on
the day prior to admission (last [**Location (un) 2974**]). He was treated in the
[**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] ICU with IVF, FFP (10 units FFP) & Vitamin K, and 13
units of PRBCs, no plts, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. He had an EGD
& c-scope at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**]. The EGD showed a small hiatal hernia,
2.5 x 0.5 cm polyp within his stomach with yellow nodule. His
duodenum was normal to second portion; no biopsies were
obtained. His colonoscopy to cecum was consistent with poor
preparation. He had lots of fresh clots, and procedure was
terminated. The patient underwent a repeat colonoscopy on
[**2164-10-30**], which showed severe diverticulosis with blood
throughout, though without any evidence of active bleed. The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2164-10-30**] for further
evaluation by IR.
.
Prior to his bloody stool on [**Name (NI) 2974**], Pt states that he was
feeling tired for several days before his bleed. He also had a
retinal hemorrhage one day prior, for which he received
injections w/ ophthalmology. Pt denied any fevers, chills, chest
pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or pain of any sort
prior to or during his bloody stool. Pt states that he has never
had a GI bleed previously.
.
In the ICU here, he has remained hemodynamically stable without
further rebleeding. He received 1 unit PRBC's this am with
appropriate increase in Hct. His diet was advanced to regular
high fiber diet. Most recent VS prior to transfer afebrile 80s
131/71 94% RA.
.
On the floors, he denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain or any more bleeding. He denies chest pain or
SOB. He says his left shoulder is a bit sore from a blood
pressure cuff on the left for several days. Otherwise, he says
he had a good lunch and dinner and is feeling well.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 86M with a history of atrial fibrillation on
warfarin, systolic CHF with EF 35%, AS with an AV area of
1.2-1.9cm2, s/p pacemaker who presented to OSH on [**10-27**] with
BRBPR in the setting of an elevated INR of 4 requiring massive
transfusion, believed to be due to diverticular bleed. Pt has
remained stable in the ICU with no further bleeding and is now
transferred to medical floor for further monitoring.
.
Active issues:
.
#. GI Bleed: Based on negative EGD and colonoscopy demonstrating
extensive diverticulosis plus total absence of any nausea,
vomiting, or abdominal pain. Pt received 10 units FFP, vitamin
K, plus 13 units  of pRBCs prior to transfer to MICU here, and 1
additional unit of PRBC's in [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**10-31**]. Neither GI nor
IR were consulted because the patient was hemodynamically stable
and did not have any further bleeding after transfer. Pt has
tolerated regular high-fiber diet on [**10-31**] and continues to
tolerate this diet with no symptoms. Pt was monitored on
telemetry with no significant events. He was initially treated
with pantoprazole 40mg iv bid but this was transitioned to his
home omeprazole 20 mg daily given lack of evidence for upper GI
bleed. His HCT has remained stable at ~30. Pt was advised to
continue high fiber diet for diverticulosis. Pt will need repeat
Hct check on [**2164-11-5**].
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled. His carvedilol was
initially held but was increased back to his home dose by the
time of discharge. His warfarin was initially held due to recent
GI bleed.  Pt has a CHADS2 score of 6.  However, after extensive
discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the Pt's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the Pt and the
PCP wanted to hold warfarin for now. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that the
risks of repeat diverticular bleed far outweighed the benefit of
stroke prevention in this setting despite Pt
