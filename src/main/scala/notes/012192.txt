Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1136**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy
Lung Mass Biopsy


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with h/o AF on ASA, CAD, HTN with a known left lung mass and
collapsed lung with chronic cough now with hemoptysis, like "red
jelly."  She notes that her "dry cough" began in [**Month (only) **] and was
initially worked up at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.  Patient has a left
lung mass identified on CT scan in [**6-1**] at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
The scan showed left upper lobe consolidation with occlusion of
the bronchus. Following that hospitalization, the patient
underwent a bronchoscopy with tissue biopsy of the mass in [**7-1**] which was non-diagnostic. The tissue pathology showed acute
and chronic inflammation with necrosis but no evidence of
neoplasm.  Per patient's son, there was some concern about
re-attempting biopsy due to recent MI in [**Month (only) **]. Given the size of
the mass and the surrounding consolidation, the patient was
referred to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2179-11-30**]. Although
the patient has experienced intermittent hemoptysis in the past,
she notes that 2 days prior to admission she experienced more
severe hemoptysis.  She notes that she intermittently coughs up
a significnat amount of blood, difficult to quantify but more
than a spoonfool ("more like a shovel"); after a while, the
coughing settles down and less and less blood comes out, and she
may not cough again for a couple more days. She feels a "tickle"
in her throat which makes her cough; she feels a "rumbling" from
deep in her lungs. Patient also notes that her voice is
different from normal.  Patient denies chest pain, shortness of
breath, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  She notes that she
does sleep on two pillows at home for comfort, but denies
shortness of breath.

In the ED, VS: 98.4 92 145/70 19 98% RA. CT Chest showed LUL
collapse with hilar lesion. She was transferred to the floor for
further management.

On the floor, she felt comfortable and was hemodynamically
stable.  She had a mild cough without active hemoptysis.

MICROBIOLOGY
[**2179-11-26**] Urine Cx - mixed bacterial flora

STUDIES:
CT Chest with contrast [**2179-11-25**]
1. Extensive soft tissue density occluding the left mainstem and
upper lobe bronchus with subsequent left upper lobe collapse. No
definite hilar or lung parenchymal mass seen. Bronchoscopy is
recommended for further evaluation.
2. 1.5-cm right upper lobe ground-glass nodule, which is
nonspecific and may be neoplastic, infectious or inflammatory in
etiology.
3. Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. Cardiomegaly and coronary artery calcifications as well as
aortic
calcifications.
5. 6- mm arterially enhancing liver lesion. Differential
diagnosis includes flash-filling hemangioma or FNH. If
clinicallly indicated, an MRI of the liver can be performed for
further evaluation.
6. 8-mm sclerotic focus within the T2 vertebral body, for which
correlation with bone scan is recommended.

CXR [**2179-11-27**]:REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient with
bronchoscopy due to suspected lung cancer and multiple myeloma.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to several prior
studies obtained on [**11-25**] and [**2179-11-26**]
The patient was extubated in the meantime interval. There is no
change in the left perihilar opacity accompanied by atelectasis
of the left upper lobe consistent with the known mass. There is
no evidence of pneumothorax. There is no appreciable pleural
effusion or pulmonary edema demonstrated.

[**2179-11-26**] Pathology of lung mass: Pending at time of discharge
Final report on [**2179-12-3**]
1. Lung, left main stem mass and blood clot (A-B):
- Adenocarcinoma, well differentiated, small fragments.
- Blood clot.

2. Lung, left upper lobe, endobronchial mass (C-D):
Adenocarcinoma, well differentiated, see note.
Note: The morphological features are consistent with colonic
origin. However, immunoperoxidase studies show the tumor to be
CK7, CDX2 (very focally) positive; ER and PR stains are positive
as well; TTF-1 and CK20 are negative. This immunophenotype is
not typical of colonic carcinoma; ovarian origin is a
consideration.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hemoptysis and Left Lung Mass:
The patient has a known lung mass found on CT scan at [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital and chronic cough with acute onset of worsening
hemoptysis.  The patient was referred to a cardiothoracic
surgeon at [**Hospital1 18**] to evaluate the lung mass and had an
appointment scheduled for next week.  However, her recent onset
of hemoptysis is concerning for bronchial arterial invasion with
the potential of causing massive hemoptysis.  The differential
diagnosis for her lung mass include: malignancy vs.
extramedullary plasmacytoma vs. amyloidosis.  On admission, the
patient was hemodynamically stable with a HCT of 30, stable
vital signs, and satting in the high 90's on room air.  To
further evaluate her lung mass, a bronchoscopy with tumor
excision was performed and the specimen was sent to pathology.
During the procedure, a large blood clot was removed which
extended halfway up the L mainstem bronchus.  Following the
evacuation of the blood clot there was active bleeding and the
patient was intubated to secure her airway.  She was transferred
to the ICU overnight for observation.  She was subsequently
extubated the following day ([**2179-11-27**]).  During her
hospitalization, the patient's aspirin was held in light of her
active bleeding. We continued to hold it until [**12-7**] when she
will be seen by interventional pulmonary and thoracic oncology
in case a procedure is planned.  Also of note, the patient's WBC
increased from 11 to 12.6 and there was concern for post
obstructive pneumonia based on bronchoscopy. She was started on
empiric treatment with Flagyl and ceftriaxone for suspected
post-obstructive pneumonia with community-acquired pneumonia and
anaerobe coverage.  A sputum gram stai
