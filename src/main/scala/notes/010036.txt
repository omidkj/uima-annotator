Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for total lung lavage.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bilateral total lung lavages.


History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 44 year-old male with a history of pulmonary
alveolar proteinosis thought to be secondary to silica exposure
who initially presented to an OSH on [**2153-11-27**] with a 2 day
history of fever, chills, and shortness of breath.  He also had
right posterior pleuritic chest pain consistent with prior
episodes of pneumonia.  He denied productive cough on OSH
admission, but did have occasional cough with post-tussive
emesis PTA.  Review of systems at that time was remarkable for
weight loss, but was negative for headache, visual changes,
night sweats, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash, LE swelling or
recent travel.

The pt. was admitted to OSH febrile to 102F.  He was initially
saturating at 95% on RA but quickly desaturated to 93% on 5L.
Per report, he was tremulous and dyspneic on presentation with
groaning on respiration and bilateral basilar dry crackles.  He
was also tachycardic.  He was admitted to the ICU and intubated
on [**2153-11-27**] (the evening of admission).  He was treated with
bactrim, zosyn and vancomycin for presumed pneumonia.  As he was
thought to be septic, he was also treated with xigris and he
also required levophed until [**2153-11-29**] to treat hypotension.

The pt. was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2153-11-30**] in anticipation of
possible total lung lavage by interventional pulmonology.

Past Medical History:
-pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, had PTX in 12/00, total lung
lavage in [**1-18**].
-EtOH abuse
-COPD
-anxiety vs. bipolar d/o.

HEENT: PERRL, MMM
Neck: prominent veins, no JVD or LAD

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis: The pt. was taken for a total
lung lavage of his right lung on [**2153-12-3**].  Evidently there were
some minor difficulties with intubation and subglottic edema,
but the procedure was otherwise uneventful.  A left total lung
lavage was performed on [**2153-12-5**] without complications.  The pt.
was initally empirically treated for Nocardia with bactrim but
this was stopped on [**2153-12-4**] as cultures remained negative.  He
remained intubated for 10 days, as the pt. became agitated at
times and also had episodes of what appeared to be respiratory
distress.  He was extubated on [**2153-12-10**] without complications.
His respiratory status remained stable for the duration of this
hospital stay.

2) Pneumonia/?Sepsis: The pt. arrived from the OSH intubated and
was treated with pressors up to 24 hours prior to transfer.  He
was also started on xigris at the OSH and he finished the course
at this facility.  He was treated with a vancomycin and zosyn
for presumed pneumonia for a total of a 7 day course.  Cultures
from the OSH and [**Hospital1 18**] remained negative throughout his stay.
It was thought that his septic appearance may have been
secondary to PAP alone.  He remained afebrile and
hemodynamically stable for the duration of this admission.

3) Elevated LFTs:  The pt. was noted to have elevated LFTs,
amylase, and lipase on presentation.  A RUQ ultrasound was
obtained and showed a mildly thickened gall bladder wall, but no
evidence of CBD dilation or cholelithiasis.  These laboratory
abnormalities quickly resolved.  It was thought that these
abnormalities were related to the passage of a stone.

4) EtOH withdrawal: While in the MICU, the pt. was kept on a
versed drip.  He was also started on thiamine, folate and MVI
supplementation.  Prior to transfer to the floor, he was
transitioned to oral valium.  He did appear somewhat tremulous
after this transition, but overall he tolerated this well and he
showed no other signs of withdrawal.  He was discharged on a
valium taper.  He plans to follow-up with a rehabilitation
program upon discharge.

6)Hypertension: Pt. developed elevated blood pressure during the
course of his MICU stay.  Amlodipine was added with effect.  He
will be discharged on low-dose amlodipine.
