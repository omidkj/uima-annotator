Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
left hip pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
noninvasive ventilation


History of Present Illness:
86yo Chinese-speaking man with h/o dCHF admitted on [**9-28**] with 3d
L-sided hip pain and fever. Mild O2 requirement, 93% on 3L NC,
WBC 16.5, and CXR with old L base opacity, started on
ceftriaxone and azithromycin for empiric treatment of CAP. He
had a witnessed aspiration event with liquids at ~0230 on [**9-30**].
RR 28, desatted to 84-88% RA, 90-91% 4L NC. Noted to have
bibasilar crackles on exam. He was given 1 ipratropium neb
treatment with little response. He was also given 40mg IV Lasix,
to which he put out approximately 400cc of urine. Repeat CXR
showed possible new RML opacity. On conversation with son, the
patient denies chest pain and shortness of breath. He was
transferred to the MICU for worsening hypoxia and possible CO2
retention.

In ICU found to have aspiration pneumonia and treated with BiPAP
and antibiotics  with some improvement. Sent to floor on [**10-7**]

EKG
Sinus rhythm. A-V conduction delay. Left atrial enlargement.
Left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2102-6-30**] the rate has slowed and ST-T wave abnormalities
previously recorded in leads I and aVL are less prominent.
Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.
.
STUDY: CT scan of the pelvis without intravenous contrast.
[**2106-9-28**].
1. Degenerative changes of both hip joints without signs for
acute bony injury. No fractures or dislocations identified.
2. Degenerative changes seen of the lower lumbar spine.
.
L-spine
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or listhesis.
2. Multilevel spondylosis.
3. Transitional vertebral body.
.
LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND:
1. No evidence of left lower extremity DVT.
2. Small left suprapatellar knee effusion.
.
LEFT HIP ULTRASOUND: No evidence of fluid collection adjacent to
the left femoral head and neck.
.
VIDEO SWALLOW EVAL:
FINDINGS: Video oropharyngeal swallow study was performed in
conjunction with the speech and swallow service. Varying
consistencies of barium liquids and barium-coated solids were
administered under fluoroscopic guidance. The patient
demonstrated premature spillover and poor valve closure. There
was marked penetration of barium liquids. There was also a
single episode of witnessed aspiration of thin barium liquids
which was not recognized by the patient. A relatively weak cued
cough was then observed. There was also significant retention of
liquids in the valleculae. There findings demonstrated minimal
improvement with [**Known lastname **] tuck maneuver and clearing maneuvers.
IMPRESSION: Significant penetration of barium liquids with
episode of silent aspiration.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The number
of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The study is inadequate to
exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. Moderate to severe
(3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet
is eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve
shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. A mass or vegetation on the mitral valve cannot
be excluded. Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
# Aspiration pneumonia:
Patient presented with left hip pain but was found to have a 3
liter oxygen requirement on admission.  On hospital day #1,
patient had a witnessed aspiration with desaturation. He was
confused and pulling off his mask.  He required transfer to ICU
for continued care.  He had been started on
ceftriaxone/azithromycin on admission for community acquired
pneumonia.  This was changed to ceftriaxone/flagyl for
aspiration pneumonia in the unit and he has completed a 10 day
course for treatment.  He did not require intubation.  Bedside
evaluation showed overt aspiration and video evaluation reveals
silent aspiration so patient is now on aspiration precautions
and modified diet.  Currently he is [**Age over 90 **]% on 2 L supplemental
oxygen
.
# Persistent hypoxia:
Likely due to aspiration vs end stage CHF.  O2 sats are
improving without anticoagulation, thus low suspicion for PE.
.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:
Onset in unit.  Back in sinus.  Patient is currently on a beta
blocker for rate control.  Consider starting coumadin as an
outpatient for stroke prevention if recurs.
.
# Left hip pain:
Pain in left hip on admission with negative work-up (CT and
ultrasound).  Ortho was consulted.  Pain resolved without
intervention.
.
# Possible neuromuscular vs CNS disorder:
Given aspiration, low NIF, and ptosis, neuro was consulted for
possible neuromuscular disease.  Recommendation for MRI and if
normal, EMG.  However, given patient's steady improvement in
house and complicated course requiring readmission to the ICU,
the family wishes to defer this work-up at this time and to get
the patient to rehab.  PCP involved and had discussion with
family re: goals of care given severe AI.  Of note,
acetylcholine receptor antibody high normal.  Neuro recommended
avoiding aminoglycosides and quinolones. Family is not currently
interested in hospice services.
.
# CHF:
Patient has end stage heart failure and is followed by D
