HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction and four vessel coronary artery bypass graft who
developed substernal chest pain while walking on the morning
of admission.  The pain was similar in quality to that he
experienced with his past myocardial infarction and did not
respond to three sublingual nitroglycerins.  He presented to
[**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department where he was noted to
have [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in the lateral leads which persisted
despite medical treatment.  The patient was transferred to
[**Hospital6 256**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2181**].  Left internal mammary artery to OM,
saphenous vein graft to D1 to OM, saphenous vein graft to
right coronary artery.
2.  Status post myocardial infarction times two.
3.  Status post PCI times four in [**2184**].
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Elevated cholesterol.
6.  Obstructive sleep apnea.  Does not use CPAP.
7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

ALLERGIES:  Morphine causes nausea and vomiting.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lipitor 20 mg po q.d.
2.  Diltiazem 200 mg po q.d.
3.  Prilosec 20 mg po q.d.
4.  Xanax 0.5 mg po q.h.s. prn.
5.  Multivitamin 1 tablet po q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient stopped smoking six years ago.
He drinks two glasses of red wine per night.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with a
temperature of 96.2.  Heart rate 81.  Blood pressure 110/60.
Respiratory rate 12 and oxygen saturation 87% on a 100%
nonrebreather mask.  In general, the patient was anxious and
uncomfortable.  Head and neck exam revealed moist mucous
membranes, anicteric sclera and no elevated jugular venous
distention.  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was benign.  Extremities
had no edema with 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  The
patient was status post catheterization with a right femoral
sheath in place and no hematoma.  Neurological exam was
nonfocal.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  Significant for a white blood cell count
of 20.0, hematocrit 41.6 and platelet count of 273,000.
Coagulation studies were within normal limits.  Panel 7
significant for a potassium of 3.8, BUN of 16, and creatinine
of 0.9.  Magnesium was 1.6.  Electrocardiogram demonstrated
normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute with right axis
deviation, Q waves in leads V5 and V6, poor R wave
progression with ST depressions in leads V1 through V3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient was taken emergently for cardiac catheterization.
Left heart catheterization demonstrated the following: Left
main coronary artery was normal, left anterior descending had
a less than 50% proximal lesion, left circumflex had a 70%
ostial lesion and totally occluded lesion distally at OM1.
The right coronary artery was totally occluded proximally
with collaterals from the left anterior descending and OM.
The left internal mammary artery was patent.  Saphenous vein
graft to D1 with a jump graft to OM was totally occluded
proximally with thrombus.  Saphenous vein graft to right
coronary artery was totally occluded proximally, but appeared
to be an old lesion.  Right heart catheterization
demonstrated a mean RA pressure of 20, PA pressures of 52/30,
mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 40, and a cardiac
output of 3.21 and an index of 1.76.  He underwent successful
stent palcement in the SVG To D1-OM.

He was then brought to the CCU on aspirin, Plavix and Integrilin
for 18 hours.  He was continued on his outpatient statin, but his
diltiazem was discontinued.  The peak creatinine kinase level was
7,535 with MB fraction of 730.  He required dopamine for the
first 24 hours to maintain blood pressures, but was quickly
weaned off.  The patient had persistent chest discomfort without
ECG changes following catheterization attributed to post-
infarction pericarditis, and a transthoracic echocardiogram
demonstrated no pericardial effusion with an ejection
fraction of 25 to 30%.  Also noted were inferolateral
akinesis and inferior and anterior hypokinesis with mild
mitral regurgitation.

On the fourth hospital day, the patient experienced recurrent
anginal chest pain while climbing stairs with Physical Therapy.
Electrocardiogram demonstrated ST depressions in leads V3 and
V4 which resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin.  Later that
evening, the patient experienced recurrent chest pain while
at rest in bed and again his electrocardiogram had [**Street Address(2) 1766**]
depressions in V3 and V4.  Electrocardiogram changes and
chest pain resolved with heparin, Integrilin, and
nitroglycerin drip.  The following morning, he was taken
for a repeat cardiac catheterization.  At this time, the
previously stented saphenous vein graft to D1 to OM jump
graft was found to be patent, and the 60% mid left anterior
descending lesion was ballooned and stented.  The 80% ostial
left circumflex lesion was also stented, and the 90% distal
left circumflex lesion was ballooned only.  Following the
procedure, the patient's chest pain resolved completely and
he continued to be asymptomatic until the time of discharge.

The patient had a persistent tachycardia with heart rate
ranging 90-100 and hypotension with systolic blood pressures
in the 80s and 90s.  He was started on low dose carvedilol
and Lisinopril, and will follow-up with his outpatient
cardiologist.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was discharged in stable
condition to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post myocardial infarction.
2.  Status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty and stent of saphenous vein graft to D1 to OM
graft, left anterior descending, and left circumflex
arteries.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
2.  Plavix 75 mg po q.d. times nine months.
3.  Atorvastatin 20 mg po q.d.
4.  Carvedilol 3.125 mg po b.i.d.
5.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg po q.d.
6.  Prilosec 20 mg po q.d.

DISCHARGE PLAN:
1.  The patient should measure his blood pressure prior to
taking the carvedilol every morning and hold for systolic
blood pressure less than 85.
2.  The patient should follow daily weights and call his
physician if his weight increases by greater than two pounds
per day.
3.  The patient will follow-up with his outpatient
cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4469**], within one week.  His phone
number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4475**].
4.  The patient will follow-up with his primary care
physician within several weeks.
