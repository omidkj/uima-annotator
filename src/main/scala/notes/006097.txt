Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Augmentin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Confusion, hearing loss

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o M ([**Hospital1 100**] speaking only) with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia,
GERD and CKD presents from home today with increasing confusion.
Mr. [**Known lastname 78171**] became acutely confused while at synagogue.  He
stood up, was clutching his head, complaining that he could not
pulse, non-diaphoretic, and told family pt likely hypoglycemic;
pt took grape juice and remained at service. He remained
confused, did not respond when people shook his hand, could not
follow readings.  He then returned home, walked on his own into
the house, and continued complaining of inability to hear.  His
son called EMS, and he was brought in to the ED by EMS. Pt was
reportedly well prior to this event, which began acutely. Only
recent illness was cough 2 weeks prior with clear CXR per son,
treated with prednisone X 3-4 days and abx X 5 days.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was agitated and unable to answer questions; he
was sedated with 2 mg Ativan.  His son, wife, and family were
present. Initial vs were T 97.4, P 72, BP 110/46, R 20, 100%.
Head CT was negative for bleeds (prelim read). The pt continued
to become more and more agitated, tachypneic, and was noted to
have ST depressions.  He was intubated for tachypnea and
agitation to protect his airway; sedation with fentanyl/versed;
VSS.  CXR showed possible RUL PNA. He was given ceftriaxone 2 g,
vancomycin 1g, acyclovir 700mg, ampicillin 2g, dexamethasone
10mg as empiric meningitis treatment.  Levofloxacin 750 mg IV
was given for PNA coverage. LP was performed once agitation was
controlled. Potassium found to be 6.6, repeat 6.7, EKG with
peaked T waves and prolonged QRS. Patient was given calcium,
bicarb, dextrose and insulin. QRS remains long with TW peaks
decreased. Repeat EKG performed (not yet read). Repeat potassium
4.9.
Blood and urine cultures were sent.  Pt was noted to have rectal
temp to 100.8; oral temp normal. Creatinine noted to be elevated
to 1.9.
.
On transfer from ED, patient's vitals were HR 103, BP 151/92,
vent fio2 100, 500x12x5; 100%.  He has 2 PIVs for access. In the
MICU, pt was found to be afebrile with vitals as below.
.
On ROS per pt's son, + for cough 2 weeks ago treated with 3-4
days prednisone and 5 days pneumonia, normal CXR. + headache. +
for DOE, but no SOB at rest. + for bilateral chest wall pain
after walking 0.6 miles twice in one day. + for gum pain, for
which pt was taking tylenol. No recent fever, chills, night
sweats, recent weight loss or gain,  sinus tenderness,
rhinorrhea or congestion, wheezing. No nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel
habits. No dysuria, frequency, or urgency. No rashes or skin
changes.

gallops

no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly

withdraws to pain

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage or shift of
normally
midline structures. The ventricles and sulci are normal in
appearance. The
basilar cisterns are preserved. The visualized paranasal sinuses
are clear. There is no evidence of acute fracture.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
MRI BRAIN:
FINDINGS: There are small foci of slow diffusion in the inferior
posterior
left occipital lobe and in the posterior right temporal lobe,
consistent with acute infarctions. There is corresponding high
signal on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, indicating that they are
at least 6-12 hours old. There is a small chronic lacunar
infarct in the right pons. There are multiple small foci of high
T2 signal in the subcortical, periventricular, and deep white
matter of the cerebral hemispheres, likely related to chronic
small vessel ischemic disease. The ventricles and sulci are
normal in size and
configuration for age. There is no evidence of intracranial
blood products. There is a 4-mm oval, smoothly marginated,
fluid-intensity lesion in genu of the corpus callosum in the
midline, which may represent a prominent perivascular space or a
cyst, rather than a chronic infarct, given its smooth margins.
The major arterial flow voids appear patent. The pituitary gland
appears normal in size.
IMPRESSION: Small acute infarcts in the left occipital and right
posterior
temporal lobes. Embolic etiology should be considered.
.
TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The basal inferior and inferolateral
segments may be hypokinetic. Diastolic function could not be
assessed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: The basal inferior and inferolateral segments may be
hypokinetic. No significant valvular abnormality seen.
.
[**2196-4-21**] MRA head and neck:
Markedly limited study secondary to patient motion artifact
without gross
evidence of occlusion, flow-limiting stenosis, aneurysm greater
than 2 mm, or arteriovenous malformation.
.
Carotid ultrasound:
1. Less than 40% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
2. 40-59% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD and CKD presents
from home today with altered mental status, sudden hearing loss
found to be febrile to 100.8 and intubated for agitation and
tachypnea.
.
# CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: The initial differential was broad
including sepsis/infection, acute intracranial process, seizure,
infectious meningitis/encephalitis, hypoxemia (e.g. from
arrhythmia), electrolyte imbalance, adrenal insuff
