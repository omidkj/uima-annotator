Pertinent Results:
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2178-11-17**] 5:00 PM

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old woman with new free air seen under diaphragm. Has
been on chronic steroids.
HISTORY: Free intraperitoneal air. On chronic steroids. Evaluate
bowel after administration of gastrografin.
COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen and pelvis from [**2178-11-17**]
at 14:16.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired contiguous axial images from the lung
bases to the pubic symphysis were acquired following the
administration of oral gastrografin. IV contrast had been
administered earlier for the previous CT examination. Coronal
and sagittal reconstructions were obtained.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Again demonstrated within
the lung bases are bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral pleural
effusions, right greater than left.
There has been no significant interval change in the large
amount of free intraperitoneal air noted. Contrast is
demonstrated within the stomach and small bowel, and there is no
evidence of contrast extravasation. Within the left lower
quadrant, there is a focal segment of small bowel which
demonstrates mild bowel wall thickening, which on the prior exam
appeared to be normal. The significance of this bowel wall
thickening is uncertain, however ischemia cannot be fully
excluded. There is no evidence of pneumatosis.
The remainder of the examination is stable.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Pelvic loops of bowel
appear unremarkable. Again no evidence of contrast extravasation
is noted. Again noted, there is a large calcified fibroid uterus
with large bilateral adnexal cysts. There is no evidence of
pneumatosis.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
essential in confirming the above findings.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of oral contrast extravasation.
2. Focal area of bowel wall thickening involving a loop of the
mid small bowel within the left lower quadrant. Previously, this
loop of bowel appeared unremarkable on the examination from
three hours earlier. The significance of this bowel wall
thickening is unclear and it may be due to under filling of this
loop, however ischemia cannot be fully excluded.
3. Otherwise, stable appearance of the abdomen and pelvis with a
large amount of free intraperitoneal air again demonstrated.

Echo:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2.There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A mid-cavitary
resting gradient is identified.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
E:A ratio: 0.50

CXR ([**11-22**]):
CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. Again
seen is a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion with
underlying collapse and/or consolidation. This is probably
slightly larger than on the film obtained one day earlier. There
is also atelectasis at the left base, with some blunting of the
costophrenic angle, slightly improved in the interim.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2178-11-27**] 6:35 AM
PORTABLE AP CHEST: As compared to [**11-26**], moderate bilateral
pleural effusions have increased in size, allowing for
differences in patient positioning. Increasing airspace opacity
within the right mid lung could represent atelectasis, but
pneumonia have a similar appearance. Endotracheal tube and
enteric tube remain in stable position.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval increase in size of now moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.
2. Atelectasis within the right midlung versus pneumonia.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2178-11-28**] 3:52 AM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-27**] and 3rd:
Left pleural effusion has resolved. No pneumothorax. Moderate
sized right pleural effusion has improved and atelectasis in the
right lower lobe decreased. Hyperinflation indicates severe
emphysema. The heart is normal size. Feeding tube passes into
the stomach and out of view while an ET tube is in standard
placement.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2178-11-30**] 3:52 AM
An endotracheal tube and feeding tube remain in place. Cardiac
and mediastinal contours are stable. There remains evidence of a
small-to- moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent
atelectasis. There may be a very minimal pleural effusion on the
left, but this is significantly smaller than on pre-
thoracentesis radiographs.

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**11-25**] urine cx, [**11-30**] urine cx: yeast
[**11-27**] sputum: MRSA (vanc-sensitive)

Brief Hospital Course:
Sputum cx grew out sparse Strep pneumo and OP flora. CXR c/w
atypical PNA. Patient tx w/ levo and then started on steroids
[**11-14**] for failure to wean from vent (tachypneic and
hypercarbic)/concern for COPD flare. She was ultimately able to
be extubated on [**11-14**] but required suction assistance w/ copious
secretions. S/p extubation, she passed a swallow eval. She was
transferred to the floor on [**11-16**] and was managed w/ a steroid
taper. Of note, on [**11-17**] CXR, patient noted to have free air
under the diaphragm. Abd CT showed large amount of free
intraperitoneal air w/ LLQ small bowel thickening - ? ischemia
but exam unremarkable w/o peritoneal signs. Surgery was
consulted but the patient remained clinically stable with benign
abdominal exam and antibx were expanded to pip/tazo. On [**11-19**]
the patient then developed acute hypercarbic and hypoxic
respiratory failure with O2 sat 59% off face mask thought [**2-25**]
combination of pneumonia, RLL collapse [**2-25**] mucous plug, and
COPD, and was transferred back to the MICU. In the MICU,
patient's respiratory status improved on BiPaP. She was then
transitioned to face mask. Her ABG improved to 7.35/64/73 at the
time of transfer to floor on [**11-20**].
.
The patient was doing well on the floor until one afternoon,
when she was found by a nurse sitting on the edge of her bed,
trying to get out of bed, disoriented, her O2 disconnected from
the wall. She c/o nausea. She was hypoxic to 57% after being
placed on 4L NC. She was then placed on 100% NRB and sats
improved to 90s. She was tachypneic to RR in high 30's and
somnolent. She was treated w/ atrovent neb and placed on Venturi
mask. Suctioning productive of moderate amount of  thick white
sputum. ABGs
