Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
Back Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PROCEDURE:
1. Thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) of
    multiple penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers in the
    descending thoracic aorta using a Cook Zenith TX2
    endovascular graft with Pro-Form proximal tapered
    component, reference number [**Serial Number 90146**], lot

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 37393**] is an 87 year old female who
developed sudden onset of back pain in her upper back,
non-radiating, associated with shortness of breath this morning.

She was taken to an OSH ED by her daughter and a CTA of her
torso
was obtained.  This imaging showed a penetrating ulcer w/ mural
hematoma of her descending thoracic aorta.  She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.  Patient reports that upon arrival to
the OSH the pain resolved and has not recurred since that time.
She denies any chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or melena.
Vascular surgery was consulted for further management
recommendations.  In the ED she was noted to have a mean
arterial
blood pressure in the 80s.  She was started on IV nitroglycerin
with immediate improvement.  ROS is otherwise negative

NO STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS ISOLATED.

[**2195-2-8**]:

CTA: Intramural hematoma is seen within the mid thoracic aorta
distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery and extending
inferiorly to the level of the aortic hiatus ([**Location (un) 11916**] type B).
There is displacement of aortic calcifications away from the
wall anteriorly. The ascending aorta is aneurysmal measuring 4.4
cm in diameter 1 cm distal to the sinotubular ridge.  The aorta
itself demonstrates a three-vessel branch pattern. At the
superior aspect of the intramural hematoma, foci of extraluminal
contrast are seen (4;135) with possible communication with the
aortic lumen. Farther down, contrast is seen penetrating the
aortic wall, displacing a flap anteriorly.  There is moderate
stenosis of the celiac origin with post-stenotic dilatation as
well as of the SMA origin. The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] is patent. The abdominal
aorta is normal in caliber. The heart is at the upper limits of
normal for size.  There is no pericardial effusion. Mitral
annular calcification and aortic annular calcification is
present. Note is made of an LAD stent.

CHEST: There is bibasilar atelectasis, without pleural effusion.
The
pulmonary arteries are patent. The central airways are patent.
There is no
pathologic axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The
soft tissues of the neck are unremarkable with medial deviation
seen of the carotid arteries.

ABDOMEN: Evaluation of abdominal structures is somewhat limited
by arterial phase of contrast. The hepatic arterial anatomy is
conventional. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen
appear normal. The left kidney contains a 1.3 cm cyst. The right
kidney appears normal. There is no intraperitoneal free fluid or
free air. The visualized loops of large and small bowel are
normal in caliber and enhancement. There is diverticulosis of
the sigmoid colon.

BONE WINDOWS: There is retrolisthesis of L5 on S1 and
anterolisthesis of L4 on L5, both grade I. Degenerative disease
is seen of the lumbar spine. No concerning lytic or blastic
lesions are seen.

IMPRESSION:

Acute aortic syndrome with intramural hematoma extending
inferiorly. Contrast within the superior portion may represent
bleeding or hemorrhage of the vasa vasorum, or extension from
the aortic lumen into the wall. More inferiorly, a flap may
represent a penetrating atheromatous ulcer versus very early
aortic dissection along the spectrum of acute aortic syndrome.
The ascending aorta is uninvolved making this fall under
[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) 11916**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 90148**].

[**2195-2-10**]:

ECHO:

The left atrium is markedly elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent
fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe aortic valve
stenosis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dilated ascending aorta. Mild aortic regurgitation. Normal
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.

INDICATION: 87-year-old with intramural hematoma, status post
endovascular
aortic graft. Evaluate for change in penetrating ulcer.

COMPARISON: [**2195-2-10**].

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest, abdomen
and pelvis
was performed following administration of 100 cc of IV Optiray
contrast.
Delayed images were also obtained through the abdomen and
pelvis. Coronal and sagittal reformats were displayed.

AORTA: Aneurysmal dilation of the ascending and proximal
descending aorta is unchanged. There has been interval placement
of a thoracic aortic stent
starting in the proximal descending aorta and terminating at the
juncture of the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Intramural
hematoma involving the
descending aorta is stable in appearance with three relatively
unchanged focal areas of enhancement, not significantly changed
compared to [**2195-2-10**].

At the distal end of the graft, there is a new type B dissection
extending
from the distal thoracic aorta to the aortic bifurcation. The
true lumen
feeds the major abdominal aortic vessels, including the celiac
axis, SMA and renal arteries arise. The dissection does not
extend into t
